1,Specialty chocolate is not for everyone,"First and foremost, the curry is overwhelming! You may as well be pouring curry powder into your mouth. I wasn't able to taste the coconut or chocolate. It had a very gritty texture and a STRONG curry smell. It had so much curry that the inside wrapper was stained. Oh well, I hope the bread and chocolate will be better."
2,SPICY not creamy,"I expected the curry flavor to be a sweet and creamy curry taste, maybe like korma sauce...or like Thai coconut soup...NOPE, it's just got curry powder in it. Spicy and really not that great. I have no idea where the coconut flavor was in this bar. I love Indian food, and I love chocolate, but there have got to be better ways to combine the two."
5,FelPro Torque specs are higher than factory,"This kit contains everything you need to complete a full upper and lower intake manifold gasket replacement on a Ford 2000 4.0L OHV V6. Be careful when torqueing down the new gaskets, following the order in the factory manual but using the torque settings from the FelPro kit's insert. This is important because the factory used a different, one piece style of lower gasket and the FelPro uses a superior two piece design. These engines are very prone to intake gasket leaks from the factory and the FelPro two piece design is an attempt to correct this. Since the gasket design is different the torque specs are as well so save that little piece of paper from the kit and use those specs, not the factory's. Also note that you will need the tube of RTV supplied in the kit to complete the lower manifold gasket seal to the block in front and back.After install this solved my Bank1 and Bank2 Lean condition and turned off the Check Engine Lamp."
4,Pretty Darn Good,"I bought this bag, and I'm very happy. I've traveled with it, and I use it almost everyday. It is sturdy, and cushions my MacBook nicely. It has plenty of room and little storage areas to keep any of the accessories that you might bring along. The only negative I have with the bag, and I'm sure this will probably go away eventually, is the lining rubs off on the contents of the bag. Some of my things that I've put in the bag have come out with a red fuzz on it. Annoying but no big deal. I think wiping it down with a wet cloth when you get it might fix it. This bag is better than most of the other bags I've seen or tried, and when you compare the fact that it is cheeper than most of those other bags I think that this one is a great buy."
1,Waste of Money,"This item is a waste of money. If you like spending your hard earn money for something not worthy, then you can buy this item just for wasting your money. If Not, don't even bother yourself of getting one. l could not believe that you can remove your money and buy something that couldn't even work for a second. When l call the company, they told me to take it to a repairer for something you have just bought without using it, then how will it even last up to 90 days. Terrible."
3,"""Heavy"" with Light duty","Yeah, its kinda heavy but unlike the other bagless vacuums, this has the crappy Bissell design where the sucked stuff goes through a flexible hose (that doubles up as the handy tool hose) into the dust collector. In most other vacuums. If something gets lodged into that hose, you are dead. period. I had the problem with a previous bissell but i thought that this was better. stupid of me, yeah. not anymore. its working fine but i won't be using it for largescale cleaning that some more expensive vacuums can do."
4,one of his best albums,"i like this release a lot, he improved on here lyrically and sound wise. he did it without a lot of features which is good. my favorite tracks are chicken hawk II and w/s fo life 2 classics along with dopeman remix."
3,Mack 10- WESTSIDE TILL I DIE!!!,"I feel this isnt tha best CD Mack 10 has realesed but it comes pretty close. Backyard Boogie, one the hits from my home town wuz ALL THAT!! - NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT, BABY!!!!-"
2,Nothing compared to his first album.,"Mack 10 couldn't do it twice. His first album is tight, but this one lacks good beats. Also, his rapping style is too lame to carry the off beats. The only way could have saved the album is if he would have had alot of guest rappers and producers."
4,Like it,"I like this CD by Mack 10. I cant say its his best, thats why I gave it a 4, but I still find myself bumbing this cd in my truck quite often. Backyard boogie has a tight beat, and the chicken hawk 2 is also a great hit. If you like Mack then grab this cd. Mack still keepin it GaNgStA!"
1,Shameless,For the author to post a review of his own book and then have the gall to give it 5 stars - he gets a big one star from me.This is a book that is 98 pages; covering a complex set of hardware and a highly involved technique and he raves that this is the only book on the subject to help people owning the machines. How about mentioning that the user's manual for these machines covers more than his book by far and is written better as well.
5,Christopher Buckley skewers the fabled Insider's Memoir,"This book will be funny to anyone, but readers unfortunate enough to have read any memoirs of the ""from the corridors of power"" genre will be convulsed. Buckley writes from the perspective of a high-ranking aide to Reagan's fictional successor, President Tucker, jotting down a diary as self-important as his real-life counterparts (one subplot turns around the writer's attempt to keep his parking spot, which seems to be of equal importance as the rest of the nation's business put together).Buckley is not just amusing, but often insightful. While the events of the book are absurd, the characters are often all too realistic. A must-read for Buckley fans, and highly recommended for anyone else."
3,"Not his best, but still pretty good","This book is still funny, although it is greatly overshadowed by Buckley's later books, Little Green Men and Thank You for Smoking, which are two of the most outlandishly hilarious novels ever written. As a memoir of an ill-fated, disaster-prone, fictional administration, it has its moments, and if you have read the two more recent books, I can still recommend this one, although it won't give you the belly laughs that Thank You for Smoking and Little Green Men did. If you've already read those two and are looking for something else by the same author, this one is still worthwhile."
1,Someone explain this,"I haven't yet read this novel - and of course I know I should not be ""reviewing"" it... But someone please explain to me - how can the Kindle version of a book - any book - be MORE expensive than the hard copy version of the same? If publishers, Amazon, or anyone, really expects those of us who have bought a Kindle to follow up our purchases with actual books, they are going to have to do better than this."
4,As good as the others in this excellent series,"I was going to comment on the well done synthesis and development of culture and religion in this series, but I noticed that one Sistermoon has already mentioned it. Like Sistermoon, I am an anthropologist and semi-pagan, and I agree completely with her praise of this book and the others in the Eileanan series. I'm getting a bit tired of the accent (since the fairy races aren't originally from the Celtic lands of Earth, why would they have Scottish accents, too?), but it doesn't interfere with my enjoyment of a tale well told."
2,What a disappointment,"Unlike others that have reviewed The Forbidden Land, I must be the black sheep and only give it 2 stars. I couldn't understand why Kate Forsyth would switch perspectives on us like that without warning. And why pick Finn to write about? She was an unworthy subject. I found it difficult to relate to Finn as a protagonist, and forgive me for being blunt, but I thought she was a twit and just wanted her to go away. I also thought it was a dirty trick for the author to leave Isabeau out of this book.However, in all fairness, Ms. Forsyth does write beautifully. Perhaps my criticism is too harsh, considering I never made it all the way through the book and allowed myself to be lead where Ms. Forsyth wanted to lead me. I struggled with this book, but halfway through gave up and went on to The Skull of the World."
3,Disappointing effort,"I really wanted to like the book. I had read the previous 3 with great enjoyment and was excited to see a sequel. However, while the book made for some light reading, I did not find it up to the usual level of Ms. Forsyth's writing. It was nice to see the character of Finn develop, but there is a jump of a number of years, and not much filled in about the time not seen. I found the adventure lively, but somewhat disconnected. I also was pleased to hear that Isabeau would be back in the next book, but unhappy to realize that this may be the start of several sequels that are not up to the standard of the original trilogy. I have noted this with several series I am reading and am in general not pleased with the trend toward poor writing to answer the question of ""but what happened next?"""
2,I got sucked into thesse books,"The most annoying thing about these books is that the author writes in a brogue that is really over done in some parts and not bad in others. The story line is really solid, but the writing leaves something to be desired."
4,Good one for its price,"Use it for connecting my laptop to TV or DVD player to TV (till i get an HDMI for that). It works and the cable is thick & sturdy. you might get a cheaper cable at Amazon from other sellers, but then you have to pay shipping. So, if you are getting free shipping on this from Amazon (throgh Prime or total order price higher than 25) then better buy this one. Belkin is known for good products."
3,OK product,"this is an ok product. initially it was not properly going into the s-video socket, but finally managed to get it working , ok for connecting DVD player/ VHS to TVIf you are buying it to connect laptop to Standard TV, try 7pin s-video + audio to RCA cable. check the type of s video socket of your device and find the matching cable"
4,Cheap and Best,"Recently Purchased this cable, reason for buying this cable is that I already had a S-Vedio Cable but was very sensitive to twist and turns, most of the time the old vedio cable use to send in black and white images which was absured. After a long research I went with Belkin's S-Vedio cable.Plus------Easy to fix.Not very sensitive , less twist and turnsHigh resistanceMinus-----lenght could have been betterOther than this one Minus I guess its one of the best cables to buy"
1,Defective Cable,One end of the cable failed to plug into a S jack. Returning it was easy with Amazon but you might want to consider a better made product. In comparison to another S-video cable I have it is very poorly made. Kind of proves the adage that you get what you pay for.
2,Poor Picture Quality,Purchased this S-VIDEO cable to replace an old frayed Composide Video cable in an attempt to get a better picture quality. Unfortunatly the picture quality achieved using this S-VIDEO cable is noticeably worse than the old Composite cable! - Would not recommend this product.
3,Cheap feel..works..,"Cheap construction and feel...thin cable, works fine though...haven't noticed any problems with interference. I expected a bit better quality out of a name brand like Belkin."
4,Belkin F8V308-06-feet S-Video cable,I received a different cable than I ordered. I received a full refund for the product. I replaced it with a better cable 29158 6 feet Velocity - S-Video cable and got good video. This was far a better cable with good results.
5,Award winning for a reason!,"What do you say about an artist with 3 Los Angeles Music Awards nominations and gained the ""National Rock EP of the Year (2007)"" award? The 'Indie Music Grammys' know a great musician when they see one. And Noush Skaugen is one to watch, just like No Cover magazine wrote.Plain said. This artist is purely amazing and every fan of great classic Folk Rock needs to have this in their collection! If you liked Joni Mitchell you're gonna love Noush Skaugen."
4,faucet,"good faucet for price. was looking for a decent cheap one, found it. works as it should. would recommend it."
4,Very good value,"While this may not be the most stylish kitchen faucet, it is functional and is very good value for the money. I used it to replace a cheap 2-handle faucet in a mobile home, and am very happy with the results."
2,Waste of money,"The box comes with 4 large strips, 6 smaller strips and oil. I found the strips to be useless because they only grabbed a few hairs at a time. The strips are also made of plastic which turned me off because its not easy to manipulate as paper strips are. I tried it on my armpits and legs and that didn't work so well but it would probably work for the small hairs on your fingers as it did for me."
1,Stay Away,I waxed a part of my leg using sally hansen strips about 3 years ago. I was badly bruised and it hurt for days. Even today the hair hasn't grown back on that particular area of my leg. I'll never use sally hansen ready to wax stips again.Thumbs up for Nair microwaveable peach melon extract wax though. It works like a charm.
5,Great Product,"I am a 13 year old with medium hair growth on my upper lip. I used the other version of this product for facial hair, titled ""Hair Remover Wax Strip for Face"". This product worked very well and efficiently. At first, I was extremely nervous--so nervous that I almost decided not to do it. First, you warm the wax strip inbetween your hands and then you simply cut it down to fit your face and put it on your upper lip area or wherever you are waxing. Then, you hold your skin taut and well, rip it off in the opposite direction of your hair growth. As this was my first time waxing, some of the hair did not get waxed because I did not plan ahead of time to tailor the wax strip to fit my face. But, it worked very well and I am pleased. A follow-up review will be posted soon."
1,Terrible product,"This is one of the worst products I have ever purchased.The box is misleading- it suggests you can actually wax your legs with this product and then includes only six 'larger' strips. The box advertises 30, 15 double-sided. Fine, but perhaps somewhere it ought to be mentioned that the majority of those are double-counted by counting both of the skinny strips that are together on one sheet? And, even when warned properly in between my hands, they did not separate well, and worst of all, left lots of residue on my legs and nearly all of the hair. Horrible Horrible product. I have used many over the counter waxing kits and never before have I experienced a product grossly misrepresented and completely inadequate."
2,Horrible product,It was the worst wax kit ive ever had the misfortune of trying. The wax never got hot enough despite minutes of hard rubbing. Once i slipped the wax strip on the afflicted area it would bunch up. After waxing only 3 or 4 hairs would come out at one time. There was simply not enough wax per stip(a very thin smear). The oil they put in the package to soothe your skin after waxing is very greasy. Please use Nair or perhaps veet instead.
2,Not Very Good,"I must say that I'm not too hapy with this product. The results are not what the product explains the outcome should be. When I first bought this, I was hoping that it would'nt be so bad, becuase it had the Sally Hensen logo on it. Anyway, when I tried it out, I was surprised that it got most of the hair off, but I still had to pluck a few strays. On the box, it says that it lasts for 8 weeks after you've waxed an area. This is a lie, because after I waxed, it grew back a few days later just like regular shaving would have done. Another thing, the box also states that the hair will grow back thinner, which is also misleading. I waxed my underarms, and the wax strips got some extra hair around the area, and after a few days, it grew back darker. I am not quite impressed with this product, and I would recommend you try purchasing TRIA, a laser-type hair remover. You can find more information about this product at triabeauty.com."
5,More Please,This CD is awesome. Yes I said Awesome. There is no other word to describe it. Rich Ward founded Stuck Mojo and Fozzy. Rich Ward also had a band called Sick Speed that he later changed to CAFU for some reason and then here comes this album with reworked material from his Sick Speed days. Which some have also made it to Fozzy. I once wrote Rich telling him what an inspiration is music is to me. I never expected an answer back but I got one the next day. This man cares about his fan base too. You want good solid rock with some great hooks and melody. Get this CD Junior!!!
5,I think it was good,"I don't care what anybody says, but I think it was a good story.It was sad how Jessie was kidnapped from his poor home in New Orleans. He was taken in a BURLAP BAG to The Moonlight, the name of the salve ship."
4,Good news and Bad news,"This was an exciting and sad book. It made me feel just so ashamed and really frustrated about what they (Captain Cawthorne, Benjamin Stout, Purvis, and Nicholas Spark) were doing to the slaves. I was also very disgusted. It was also really interesting, but at some points it is very surprising. The end was just so spectacular for Jessie and Ras. Ras was the African boy that Jessie taught and became friends with, after the shipwreck. But, during the book at some points it makes you want to go into the book and slap Captain Cawthorne and Benjamin Stout for what they have done, and what they continue doing to the Africans. I really liked the book. I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone that's immature. Other than people being immature I would definitely recommend it."
2,It's OK,"This was very sad book. I dont think that this book is very good for little kids because it is very grusome. It was about a boy named Jessie who was kidnapped and then taken to a sip called The Moonlight. He was taken to play his music so the slaves could ""dance"" and to keep them strong. In the end Jessie was mentaly damaged. He could not listen to any type of music or dance."
5,Unforgettable,"This is a great book. However, it is not for the faint of heart! As a parent of two younger children I am not sure that I would want my ten year old daughter to read this book. The Slave Dancer is the story of a thirteen year old New Orleans boy who is kidnapped and forced to work on a slave ship. This book really made me feel like I was there, watching the pain and agony that surrounded Jessie. I heartily recommend this book for teenagers and adults interested in historical fiction. This book certainly deserved the Newbery Medal in my opinion. I simply couldn't put the book down and finished it in one day. One final caveat, don't read this book if you only like stories where everyone lives happily ever after. This book is about real life, pain and sorrow, grief and rage. But also about friendship, honesty, and courage. To any adults reading this, don't let the kids have all the good stuff. Read this book for yourself; it stacks up favorably against the best of adult fiction."
4,To Dance With Slaves....,"The title sais it all. The slave dancer by paula Fox is a great short for experienced readers. The andventure of the plot will catch your Attention faster than Jessie can play his pipe. The only downfall of this plot is the... Well, we will let the discovering part of the adventure to you. Even After reading this book, You will wish you could dance with slaves in and on the mnoonlight as much as i wish i could do."
4,Deadly Trades,"Jessie Boller is a thirteen year old kid who is captured and is held captive on a ship. He is ordered to play his fife every day for the slaves on board. In the story he is treated as one of the slaves himself. He is always taking orders from the captain. It leaves you in suspense every time you finish a chapter, and you are always wondering what will happen next. I would rank this story four stars. So try the book today. It will leave you speechless."
3,Good,"I think this book is good but I would not reccomend it because I think instead of putting pirates they could of been more creative. I aslo think they could of changed the time, that was way off. Other than that, the book was good."
1,the slave dancer,"BOARING, da only reason i had to be readin dis book waz cuz of ma teacha.....BOARIN BOOK"
2,"2 1/2 Stars... sad, sometimes boring... but a good subject to learn about","Okay, so it was unbelievably sad at points (Noo!! PURVIS!! DON'T DIE!!) and really boring (how long should you describe a carved box?) it's a good subject to know about. Pretty heavy stuff. Uh, yeah. But we don't want history to repeat itself.It was okay book, but there's no way that I'd read it on my own w/o my teacher making me. And I'd never recommend it. But anyway, if you MUST read it, read it. If you don't have to, I beg of you -- don't.~Livi, A Reviewing Prodigy"
2,The Slave Dancer,"I thought The Slave Dancer was an ok book. It was not the book of my choice, and I wouldn't read it again. The only thing I didn't like was that there wasn't enough action and it wasn't very descriptive. Like when they were taking the slaves on the ship there wasn't much action. Also when he was walking home they could have been more descriptive. Otherwise I thought it was pretty good, and if you like books with slaves in them this is the book for you. I wouldn't recommend this book to read because in my opinion I think it was a waste of time. While we were reading The Slave Dancer, by Paula Fox, we learned about Jessie's adventure on the slaver. In the beginning, Jessie, a young boy, gets captured and taken on a small ship called the Moonlight. Jessie was taken on the slaver to make the slaves dance... The Slave Dancer explains an expedition on a slaver in the 1840's."
4,The Slave dancer,"This book is a great one and I recommend you buy it. It is filled with great plots from begining to end. Young Jessie is captured and sent abord a slave ship to dance the slaves to keep them healthy. When the ship crashes, he and a black boy named Rass are the only ones who make it asore. There they find an old man who helps them both. In the end Jessie makes it home. To find his mother and sister there just the way he left them 5 months ago. (his father died a long time ago) It was a very happy ending! I loved this book because it kept me interestered from beginning to end with all the plots and detials in it. This was truly a great book!"
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ! Wake me up when I finish the book!,"This book was totally boring. I had to force myself to finish it. Even though it was very short, it took me about three months to finish it! I really do not recommend this book to you unless you're the type that snores while reading. Oh well, I don't think I should be giving such harsh comments to this book. Bye!!"
4,The Kid in the Moonlight,"This story takes place in 1840 on the ship called the Moonlight. This is important because Jessie has a small amount of food and the crew members are very rough. This is also important becausein 1840 people still had slaves. So this is a difficult challenge for Jessie.This book is mostly about a 13-year-old white boy named Jessie. When Jessie was going home he was caught and he was put on a ship called the Moonlight. The Moonlight carried slaves to different places. While on the ship he made friends with two crew members, Purvis and Stout, and he has hardships on the Moonlight. Then something happens on the ship that will change Jessie's life forever.In my opinion this is a great book and explains things that happens to a boy in 1840. You get to see how life was in the 1840s. It shows that different colored people can be friends. I would reccommend this book because it is educational and a very entertaining book at that."
4,Exciting!,"This was a great book! I gave it 4 stars because at first I thought it was going to be a typical boring summer reading book. It turned out GREAT! It is now one of my favorites! It kept my attention because it was a short, quick read."
3,synopsis,"Jesse was taken from his home at the age of thirteen. He played the fife well. He was asked to dance the slaves so that they would not lack their exercise. The book was depressing, therefor people who do not like sad stories should not read this book."
1,I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WAS TERRIBLE AND BORING!!!!,THIS IS A STORY ABOUT A BOY THAT WAS KIDDNAPED AND WAS ON A SLAVE BOAT FOR 4 MONTHES AND CAME BACK HOME VERY HAPPY. IT WAS REALLY BORING AND I DIDN'T ENJOY IT MUCH AT ALL.
1,"boring, unoriginal","I have to read this book for an eigth grade Language Arts class. Like other children have stated, I was forced, and fell asleep in desperation trying to read the chapter a night the teacher forced upon us.This is certainly not a ""clencher"", even remotely original or interesting.The cliched plot is set around the illegal 1800's slave trade, and involves a kidnapping, sea battles, cruel men, and two teenage boys surviving a shipwreck off the coast of Mississippi. Near the end, I have found it a hard task to finish, I still don't know the point of the story."
4,City Tree Student review,"I liked this book alot because the author made all the characters come to life. She did it by describing their everyday lives. It was a real page turner, because she made you think one thing was going to happen and then slowly but surely another thing happened. Like when Nickolas Spark shot the black slave I thought nothing was going to happen but he ended up taking along vacation to meet the fish if you know what I mean. Also I thought that they were going to make it to Cuba and back to New Orleans, but they ended up getting attacked by the British, losing the ship, and all of the crew and cargo ended up dieing exept Jessie, and a slave named Ras. Ms. Fox also uses very sophisticated vocabulary. Also Ms. Fox uses her vocabulary in a very precise way."
3,A Good Historical Book...,"I just finished Paula Fox's book The Slave Dancer. This book didn't really catch my interest, because I don't really like reading about history and slaves. Jessie Bollier is 13,and he is taken from his home and put onto a ship called The Moonlight. He is forced to play his fife for the black slaves on the ship. Jessie hasn't seen his mom or his sister Betty ever since he was taken on the ship. Will Jessie ever return home? Read this book to find out!"
4,The Slave Dancer,"The Slave Dancer is a historical book. I liked it, but it had its tough bits. The book was extremely sad and sometimes was a little uninteresting. That is why I took the star away. But we must realize that this is a realistic book and shows what actually hapened and how they treated slaves. The author also describes extraordinarily well. If you are looking for a historical, realistic,book and like deaths this is the book for you."
1,This book is bad,"The book The Slave Dancer by Paula Fox, starts out with a thirteen year old boy named Jessie getting kidnapped and was put on a ship. There were many slaves on that ship because they were doing a slave trade. They needed Jesse because they needed someone who could play a fife. Later on, he met, Purvis and Ben Stout. Before they were at there final destination, there was a ship wreck. Only two people survived. If you want to know who you will have to read the book.The book The Slave Dancer by Paula Fox is not a very good book because it is a very sad and boring. First, a little boy gets captured and taken on a slave ship and get whipped. Later there is a shipwreck. A lot of slaves die. I think this book is boring because there isn't anything to learn off of it an there is really no point to it This is why I don't recommend this book."
1,I hated it,I am a student in the 8th grade and hve to do many different projects on it from the beggining I did not like it. The more that I understand it the more I hate. This is a all around bad book.
1,Lacks sensitivity .,"The major problem that I have with this book is that it may be presented by some teachers to African-American youth without the proper discussion. The potentially offensive and harmful parts of the book could reek havoc on some young minds. The potential embarrassment for some African-American students who read about a character who proclaims himself as better that any black person who every lived must be considered. Certainly the book does not endorse this statement ultimately but, by then, the damage has been done. Regardless of what prizes this book has and who excuses the overt racisim contained therein as ""literary merit"", this book cannot be approached without much caution. Do we really need to import this kind of literature into our schools? Don't we already to a good job of placing emphasis on our differences? Enough is enough!"
1,The Slave Dancer,"The book I read was The Slave Dancer. I think The Slave Dancer was Ok. I think it was Ok. because they had a lot of Interresting words. They also had slavery. It did had adventure. I would recommend it to anyone.After reading The Slave Dancer by Paula Fox we were amazed by the realistic settings and characters of the book. In the book the character Jessie who is kidnapped by the crew of the Moonlight. Once the slaves board he is forced to empty the latrines and help clean the holds. They had a ball for the slaves the ship ran into the American Patrol. They then had to throw all the slaves overboard but Jessie saved a slave name Ras. Ras and Jessie escaped to the hold and stayed there for a while. All of the crew died excepted for the evil captain. Ras and Jessie escaped by floating ashore on a piece of wood of the ship, they then met Daniel who took care of them. Ras went to the North and gave Jessie directions to go back home. In Conclusion, we thought this book was amazing."
2,The Slave Dancer,"In order to understand what it was like to be on a slaver, either as a slave or crewmember, a good book to read is The Slave Dancer by Paula Fox. The quality of the literature, however was not exceptional. First of all, there was not a substantial amount of action. In the parts where there actually was action, the author was too descriptive and not enough time was spent writing about the action itself. Overall, I would give The Slave Dancer one and one half stars out of five."
5,Good all purpose towel,"Used this towel to dry my car. Soaked up water quite nicely. Better than expected. Believe me, you do not have to pay an arm and a leg to get decent microfiber towels."
4,Genesis: When in Rome,"Overall I really enjoyed this video. The image quality, lighting, camera shots and sound quality were outstanding !! While I was a little skeptical that a band of this age could pull it off, they did in grand style. Phil Collins' voice, while not as strong as it was, was still as passionate and emotive as ever. The excitement and enthusiasm of the crowd was astonishing and could be felt as I watched the movie.Only two criticisms, one of the movie, one of the band. As to the movie, I would have liked to have seen more special features rather than just the short behind-the-scenes vignettes. A selection of camera angles (i.e. just the drums or keyboards) would be a terrific addition as would some scenes of editing the DVD or setting up the elaborate stage and lighting display. As to the band, I would have liked a few more of the older songs and fewer of the newer one; that being said the In the Cage medley was unforgettable.This DVD is one to get. You will not tire of watching it."
5,GET OVER IT,"For all the dummies and critics who say, ""Phil Collins voice isn't the same"", ""Tony Banks, Mike Rutherford, etc look old"", ""they move slower"", ""the tempo is a little slower"". Get over yourselves! These guys are in late 50's early 60's. Phil STILL has a voice and plays drums remarkably well. When you're around 60, see if you are able to do things the exact same way you did when you were 25-30. And, if you are 55-60, shame on you for still being ignorant and not understanding ""CHANGE AND LIFE"". And, I'm sure you are not doing things the way you did them 30 years ago. They are all still fine musicians. Don't be stupid."
5,IN THE BLOODY CAGE AGAIN!,"Hi All,The When in Rome DVD is a piece of great work and i think the classic song In the Cage and also the meddley are terrific. Phil Collins playing great drums on this meddley, specially on Duke's Travel; Tony Banks and his long keyboards solo; and Mike Rutherford playing a superd bass (yeah, this is a good chance to see Mike as a fantastic bass player); Daryl and Chester are perfect as usual. The production is wonderful. No doubt! Go for it! Oh, I forgot, you also get a briliant Ripples; the instrumental Los Endos with the drum duet; the classic hit I Know What I Like (like the old times) and of course all the hit songs from the 80's. I think When in Rome represents their greatest live action."
2,Awful experience,"All these glowing reviews are absurd. Why? Simple.This is one of the msot boring muscial videos ever made. Director David Mallet tried to capture the experience of being in the middle of the audience. But apparently his intention was to make you feel as if you were at the bottom row of the audience! The whole thing seems so far away, so punchless, that sometimes you feel the concert is in a galaxy far, far away.Also, the endless (I repeat, ENDLESS) shots of the audience are ludicrous, never seen such a thing in a rock video.All in all, a DVD so forgettable and so unfair to the quality of Genesis."
4,Better than I expected,"This DVD was bought with a lot of apprehension. I found that overall this is a good production. The reason it didn't score a 5 star rating is that I could have done without some of the fluffy pop stuff. That being said, this is a fairly inspired performance featuring some great playing. At the beginning of the show they seem a little sluggish and the songs don't flow with the usual power. But, the band warms up with great versions of Follow You, Follow me, Firth of Fifth and I Know what I Like. Ripples was a true highlight of the show. Phil sang it with so much heart. It was also nice to hear the band thank the Italians for saving them in the early days before they hit it so big. Overall worth the purchase to see this special concert."
5,Genesis Rome DVD release....,"The long awaited release of the live DVD ""When In Rome"" has been reported to be May 27th in the states, and if you go onto the official Genesis site, they have it for pre-order as the release date being June 10th. It's to be a 3-DVD set. 2 DVD's for the complete concert with tons of extras, and the 3rd DVD being a documentary of the tour being planned and executed. I hope that this settles everyone's interest in the DVD release. I am eagerly awaiting my copy to be delivered!!"
5,Great Stuff,"This is one for the time capsule. The ""Come Rain or Shine"" documentary that is included in the set is great too. I must have for any Genesis fan."
2,Very Disappointed,"I was given this as a birthday gift as I am something of a fan of the group. I was really looking forward to see it as I had missed seeing them when they came to LA. So, imagine my surprise when I find the whole set stuffed with ""F-Bomb"" after ""F-Bomb"". No, warning from Wal-Mart (the official supplier of the set), no warning sticker, no warning on the screen. I was very disappointed with this product. What then made it even worse was just past half way through the documentary on disc three, we end up with a few censor bleeps anyway, just making the whole thing seem shoty.If you are someone who does not care, it is a fantastic set, in truth had it been censored I would have given it higher stars, but if you are someone who does care, do yourself a favor and skip it."
5,The Best For Last...,"I have been a Genesis fan from the begining. I lean more toward the epic songs rather than the short pop songs. This is by far the best live produced Genesis dvd on the market. The song selections is perfect with the exception that they left out material from Abacab. My favorite high-lite is the In The Cage Medley with the full version of Afterglow (priceless). Of course the guys have gotten old like the rest of us, but are at high standard for this show and they closed it down in style. The back drop of Rome and the 500,000 people that showed up to see this event is quite impressive. The bottom line, this dvd does not let down....enjoy!"
4,Tank parking sign,"Exactly as advertized and affordable...which it should be for something that is mostly a bit of spoof. It exactly met my needs...and my grandson, nicknamed TANK, loves it."
1,"lame, godawful, horrible music","this is the worst thing ever to happen in the annals of music history. just terrible! i'd rather have acid put into my ears with a dropper and fed diarreal feces through a funnel, rather than sit through this crap!"
3,Big Buttons (good) Hard to read display (bad),"While basically a decent product, there are a couple of flaws that I would change if I could : 1 - The display screen, while large, is difficult to read at any sort of angle. 2- The receiver does not sit securely in the cradle - it is very easy to knock off. Otherwise, I like the european-style ringing and the styling is compact and well laid out. Also it's great for those who prefer larger buttons for dialing. Not perfect by any means, but pretty good value for money."
1,Self-promoting and flawed,"When i bought this book i looked up the word 'pessoa'. This means person and plural 'pessoas' means people. Grammatically this word is always feminine but applies to both male and female. This does not fit in with what this grammar teaches. I sought help. Then i was shown several faults in this book. The worst apears to be the verbs.I bought this book because i believed what it says, that it is a practical guide to the mastery of Portuguese. I fell for it and am quite annoyed with myself for being so gullible. Perhaps some good will come out of this bad experience. If this review stops other learners from making the same mistake, then it wasn't a cmplete waste of time and money."
1,Apontamentos de estudante,"This book resembles my apontamentos de estudante (student notes) when I was a beginner learner of Portuguese. It is far from being an authoritative grammar book that will lead you to the mastery of Portuguese, as it appears to think it is. It lacks the background knowledge of the language that will enable to streamline what is important and what comes second. It is very much, as I said, a tentative work of a beginner learner, not the competent guide a master can devise. Not good enough.As someone who can speak the language quite well, I was asked my opinion on this book. That is how I came across it. Here it is my opinion, not just for the learner who asked me but for all the learners looking for good books who may read this review. Look elsewhere is my advice."
2,Not much improvement,A change of cover but not much improvement on the previous edition. This is neither a grammar nor a book on verbs. It's no more than what you get in any good course book where you also get a lot more. Sorry but not worth the money!
3,Plain and simple,"It is a very basic grammar book that covers all the gramatical aspects of Portuguese, over time more material will be needed to go deeper but it makes a great start!"
1,"Unsafe (especially for pets that will run away), Easily Broken, Heavy, and Bulky","Unsafe (especially for pets that will run away), Easily Broken, Heavy, and Bulkyyou can see my full review for the identical item here:Beige Flexible Handle Pet StrollerI returned this ""flexible handle"" piece of junk from Amazon and bought the Petgear brand Happy Trails stroller from CSN stores, a reputable Ebay seller. The Petgear stroller is much lighter, has the same interior carriage dimensions, and has a safer, heavy duty zipper as well as much better alignment and more sturdy wheels. From Ebay, this stroller was only $87.95 (with Free Shipping) which is about what I paid to get this low-quality bulky stroller from Amazon once shipping is figured in (not to mention the cost of shipping it back which Amazon isn't going to refund at this point)."
4,Colorful and cute,"These lights are so cute in my room. As to be expected, the flowers are made of the same material in cheap Hawaiian party necklaces, but for the price, it's alright. The flowers are very colorful though, and they give my room the pizzazz I was looking for! The chain is a little too short though, since half of it has to be used reaching an outlet."
2,Don't expect much,Bought three sets to put in my patio umbrella. Although pretty when lit they are very cheaply made. So just don't expect quality and you'll enjoy them for a season.
4,great little string of lights!,these are great little lights to hang up at night around the umbrella for a nightlight! the ladies at work wanted to know where i got them... amazon of course!
4,Works great,"This item works very well. I have not run out of fuel and I have used it to melt rope ends several times. It is difficult to light with one hand (at least for me). The red ""trigger"" has to be pulled back and then pushed down. Not difficult to do with two hands, hard to do with one. It lights reliably and stays lit. If I lose mine, I will get another one."
1,"Sucks, nothing compares to the SOTO pocket torch, don't buy this immitation","I thought this would be a cheaper or ""amazon prime"" worthy purchase. . . It's not. I couldn't get it to work at all, tried several lighters and it's also PAINFULLY annoying to disengage the childproof lock each and every time you want to strike it. It's too hard to do each time. I just want to push the dang button down and see blue flame, neither of those were possible with the one I bought. I returned for a full refund. Thank goodness!"
1,Cheap construction and sub par product.,I was so underwhelmed with this product. The price was outrageous for what it was. Basically a shell to house regular cheap lighters. Waterproof? I don't think so. Jet flame? Not! Save your $20 and go to your local tobacco shop to buy any lighter there and it would be better.
5,Baby loves it,"Received quickly and all was in perfect condition. Our baby is 17 weeks old and according to the doc, ready for solids, so we started with the cereal. He loves it and it seems to work well as a first introduction to solids. I would recommend for other moms."
5,A wonderful reading experience!,"Shalom My Love is a wondrous addition to anyone's personal library, especially those bereaved following the death of a special love, such as widows and widowers. They will thrill to the wealth of ongoing after-death communication (ADCs) that Sunny and Gadi achieved, offering all of us reassurance that life and love are indeed eternal."
5,"Heavy, and I'm happy","What a great multi-tool! I looked at Leatherman, and Gerber, and finally decided to get this one after reading some great reviews on the SwissTool RS. The only difference between this one, the SwissTool RS, and the SwissTool X are a couple of tools are interchanged. THis link goes to the user-manuel, which explains which tools have which tools. http://www.swissarmy.com/CustomerService/Documents/UserManuals/swisstoolmanual.pdf . This is a very heavy product (10 Oz). I really like that about this multi-tool. I am a big guy (6'4""), and I liked that this product felt like you could really work with it and not worry about breaking it. The craftsmanship in this tool is completely evident. You have to hold it to really understand it. The case is also finely crafted. The steel came very very sharp also.Victorinox took pride in creating this tool. You can tell.The Rachet is what it is. Sometimes its hard to get the bits out of it, but besides that it works great too."
4,Delightful book,"From Harlem nightclubs to the shoppers of Macy's, architecture to human nature, this book is replete with full-page photographs that together compose a portrait of New York at the time. It's amazing to simultaneously see how different it is today, yet how similar. The book is short on descriptions but each caption is insightful and more than a mere description of the subject of the photo. One amusing one shows Central Park where ""expensively tailored women walk expensively tailored dogs."" My favorite photographs in this book are those of ethnic neighborhoods, from Greek to Syrian to Jewish and so forth."
4,"Fun, catchy, nice melodies",The album has really grown on me and I only have a rudimentary grasp of Spanish.
4,Nice work.,"Love the constant accordian, and the addition of rappers Daniel Spinetta and Anita Tijoux on a couple of tracks makes this more interesting. The final track, ""Sin Documentos"", is heartbreaking.Ms. Venegas uses a variety of styles, from cumbia to Euro disco. From track to track, you get something different."
5,5 stars from beginning to end,Not 1 second of wasted time in the 89 minutes. A great historical tribute translated into our time.I know I will be watching this again and again.
3,Bomber Boys,"There is nothing wrong with this product, but it is strictly for history buff's. I misread the information, and thought it was another action movie, which it was not. Merchandise is quality and certainly there is nothing wrong with the actor Ewan and his brother. I was just not interested in the history dialogue."
5,looks pretty in kitchen,I got this for my kitchen and i am glad i did. it makes a difference in my kitchen makes it look so pretty.
5,"2PAC SHAKUR , SNOOP DOGG, ICE CUBE, DRE , AND MASTER P","I THINK THAT DA CD IS REALLY TIGHT AND WHERE I LIVE ITS SO HOT. I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO 2PAC SHAKUR , SNOOP DOGG, ICE CUBE, DRE , AND MASTER P! AND YALL HAVE SET A GREAT EXAMPLE FOR ME AND I WANT TO BECOME AND BE LIKE YALL WHEN I GROW UP. I JUST WANT TO BE LIKE YALL AND I HOPE IT HAPPENS. I LUV ALL OF YALL BROTHAS! SEE YA AROUND HOMMIES! (I HOPE)PEACE!"
5,Refreshed classics,"An awesome complation with classic tracks like 'Gin & Juice','Nuthin but a G thang' and 'Ain't no fun' bumping all the way.The first CD is da bomb but the second should not have beenon there.I think of the remixes and unreleased tracks as a way ofhogging up space.Still, a great 2CD!"
5,No Vaseline Needed,"One of the Greatest compilations to come out in recent history. The Best songs are no vaseline on eof the classic disses of all time, nuthin but a g thang baby, and any of the 2pac or snoop dogg songs. Just Keep on ridin"
4,Good but flawed sampler,"There's no doubt that the music is excellent, but there's a little too much overlap with ""The Chronic"" & ""Doggystyle"" (about half this CD), so you're getting a lot of tracks you probably already have. Great remastered sound, though. A lot of disk 2 is taken up with remixes of material from disk 1, and could have been better filled with different tracks or some material from albums not already sampled or some more 2Pac tracks. Still, a good value and great entertainment if you don't want to go for the individual CDs."
4,This is a Tight Compilation...but...,"If you really want to have Death Row's Greatest hits, you jsut need to go out and pick up ""The Chronic"", ""DoggyStyle"", & ""All Eyez on Me"". That's Deathrows greatest...No questions asked!"
4,Nice to have hands free,"the ear piece is incredibly uncomfortable so I have to use the headband which keeps the speaker just a little away from the ear so I have trouble hearing soft talkers, and the volume doesn't go high enough... maybe I'm just getting old."
2,Wireless Headset,"I enjoy the freedom that a wireless headset provides. For years I used a wired headset and I can't say how many times I dragged the base unit off the desk by reaching for something nearby. However, it's difficult to find a comfortable head position with this headset and the earphone doesn't easily settle into place on my head. Also, there's an echo of some kind of my voice if I turn up the volume loud enough to comfortably hear the person I'm speaking with. I'm always trying to make adjustments both to position and volume with this set but haven't found the ideal yet."
4,Awesome product,This product is great... it makes working a lot easier I can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something. I only have an issue with volume control. Some calls are louder than others.
4,Almost everything I need,I bought the Plantronics Wireless Headset so that I would not be tied to my desk while I'm on the phone. The sound quality is close to that of my old wired headset. It gives three choices of earpieces so you can pick what's most comfortable for you. It's light weight so I don't mind wearing it for long periods. The only drawback I see is that you have use the phones handset to take a call off hook. That means you have to be next to the phone to answer a call.
1,Horrible Service!!!,I left several messages and heard no response. I never received the item and I even paid extra for express delivery. The item was supposed to be here over a week ago and I have yet to receive it or get a returned response from the seller. I will never purchase from Boyton again.
4,cheap office solution,This product doesn't have the sound quality of the higher model. It also does not work as well in a multiple unit office.But for the money a good solution.
4,Works Well,"I bought these headsets for my office because we are constantly on the phone, and I have to say they work well. They are comfortable and easy to use. For us, being able to work all day with no need to charge was a plus. I recommend anyone who works on the phone to try the heasets, as they can withstand a lot of usage."
5,Been using the same one for 6 years now,"I've been using this product for 6 years now - Monday thru Friday, at least 5 to 6 hours talk time everyday, and it's still working like a champ. It's amazing that the rechargeable battery is still taking full charges.I like this much better Plantronics' later bluetooth model - the range is just too small. With the CS50, I can roam around the office - or even venture out to the parking lot - and still continue my phone conversation. This is the best Plantronics product ever."
2,Plantronics FAIL,"I'm pretty disappointed. Supposed to be able to work fine with our Cisco phones, but after you play with the unnecessarily numerous adjustments, we are still left with 3 options; A) can't be heard...period! B) can hear you but it sounds like you're talking through a drain pipe. C) Can hear you but it sounds distorted like you are communicating from the Space Station. What is the point in hands free communication if you can't communicate? This could really be a dynamite headset if not for all of the setbacks. At the price I paid, even after the severe discount, this should be flawless given the brand it is. I would be more irritated if I had paid full price."
1,Monster sized earpiece,"The other plantronics have the electronics behind the ear. This one has the electronics and buttons on the side and it tends to be floppy. I returned these on the first day I received it. If you don't get an upgrade, you'll probably regret it."
1,Can't hear the phone ring through this headset,"It is not portable at all, because you just can't hear the ring through the headset. Why bother to have a wireless headset if you have to stay close the phone to be able to hear it rings.?"
3,Headset,"The Plantronics is an okay headset. You hear some echoing when talking, and it can get bothersome some times wearing on your ear all day either with the head piece or the one that hangs from your ear. And then if you don't purchase the automatic handlifter you still can't get far from the phone."
3,Plantronics CS50 900 MHZ Wireless Headset,The over all quality of the Ear Piece is excellent Clear reception on both ends. The only negative thing our office all agreed on was the Ear Piece was very uncomfortable to wear. We have since requested a alternate Ear Loop from Plantronics and hope this will resolve.
2,It works,The headset does not sit well on my head and I have to keep shifting it back onto my ear. And I do not have what I consider to be an unusual head.Otherwise the thing works as advertised. I have been virtually everywhere in my house and most places in the yard and still can talk. The people I talk to hear me fine. I hear them fine. But my own voice sounds a bit distorted to me.Be prepared that it is NOT a bluetooth headset. You must still answer the phone by picking up the handset and then engage the headset. And if the call ends and you are away from the handset you have to return to hang it up. There is a separate handset 'lifter' that solves this but I think I will wait until I find the type of device I really want. For now it works.As headsets go this is a lower cost unit. I got what I paid for.
1,bad....doesn't work,Didn't work. Clients cant here me on the phone and came with no directions def upset i pad 100$ for this
3,Not for a home office,"I'm in the middle with dealing with what seems to be a common problem with the CS50 - compatability. I had this same headset in my office connected to a Cisco phone and worked great. I bought one recently for my home office and it's not compatable with my 2 line ATT phone. I looked into buying another phone but can't find a home office phone that is compatable with it. The more I think about it, I'm wondering if it's worth the $200-300 while my $79 phone is working just fine. Beware, you may have to buy an expensive phone for this model to work. I may try upgrading my phone and going with the CS55, which looks like has more phone options."
2,Not Compatible,This product was not compatible with my phone that I was trying to use it with. I actually originally called into Amazon's customer service and the representative advised me that it shows that it is compatible with most phone sets. I feel that plantronics needs to be more specific on what types of phone set's it's compatible with.
2,"Some work, some dont.","I purchased FIVE wireless headsets around the same time for my office workers. One tried to get it to work, and finally gave up. She kept getting a feedback sound in the headset even when not on a call. I dont know if it was something in the walls making it have feedback, but we couldnt get the problem to stop so she went back to a wired headset.I have been using the headset she had problems with, and i constantly have that annoying pulsing feedback.One of the five just quit working this week.Problems with 2 out of 5 headsets seems like pretty poor odds to me.I will try a different kind next time...if there is a next time."
5,Wireless headset works great,"I've been using this headset model for a few years now. I just recently bought a replacement (same model) as the first one I had finally started to have intermittent issues after a few years of heavy use. The sound quality is great, it's comfortable to wear, and I'm able to be mobile to pick up print jobs, go to a coworker's desk, etc. while on the phone. The battery life is great as long as I remember to keep the headset in the cradle overnight. I'd highly recommend it."
4,Office Manager,"I've purchased 7 of these headsets and we all love them. Sound is clear and crisp, keeps background noise out and we can roam around the office with no connection disruption."
3,Great product but no remote answering capability as described.,"In the product description they clearly state ""While away from the main station, it only takes one button to answer or end a call."" What they don't tell you is that you will need to purchase a handset lifter that costs $52.59 to be able to answer the call with one button while away from the main station. I was careful to purchase a headset with this remote answering capability and read the description very carefully to make sure that the headset I was buyin had this feature! They need to change the desciption.BTW, I love the headset but would have purchased same brand with with remote lifter in box."
4,Beautiful Cards...but..,"I love the cards and have found them fairly easy to read. I love how they seem to hold a new meaning everytime you look at them. They are very colorful and have some of the best illustrations I've seen on tarot cards. They contain great detail and the book gives fantastic information on the ancient celtic wisdom of the cards and is an interesting, different way to read.However, I am unimpressed with the books instruction on reading the cards. It gives ample information on celtic wisdom, care of the cards and how to line them up. It does not give much information on the handling of the cards during a reading or the interpretation of the cards based on the question asked. Not a good choice for beginners, as the book can become somewhat confusing..."
2,Not as good as I thought it would be,"As a serious collector of Tarot Card decks and sets, I added this one to my collection right away. In my opinion, the cards are too large to handle for serious divination work. They would be much better for meditations. The coloring is bright and beautiful. But the coating on the cards makes them stick together at times. I was really disappointed by this set."
4,Excellent reference of Emilia-Romagna cuisine,"Biba's Taste of Italy is not only one of the few cookbooks devoted entirely to the cuisine of Emilia-Romagna, but it is a thorough, well-written reference to this area's rich culinary heritage. Lots of tips for success, clearly written recipes, and good anecdotes."
3,Not enough recipes,"If you're more interested in local flavor or in the history of the recipes involved then this is a good book for you. I prefer a cookbook with more recipes and less chit-chat. However, she does include ""helpful tips"" which I found useful."
5,NICE,RONNIE CLAY YOUR GAY MAN JUST SAY YES MAN YOU ARE AND YOU HATE ANIME [...] ANY WAY I LOVE THIS ANIME SET IT ROCKS SO HARD GO BUY IT ANIME FANS AND FRIENDS
3,I'll give you a happy lesson don't watch,"A high school guy goes to live with 5 women who have their own dreams. We follow the trials, tribulations, joy, and heartbreaks in this Anime comedy/drama. This series is way too bland for my tastes. I guess their's a demand for it, there must be as this and ""Sister Princess"" and ""Love Hina, and ""Tenchi Muyo, and blah blah blah, etc. are all the same. This one isn't as good as most in the sub-genre. And I don't really recommend it much at all."
1,DVD does not play,I purchased this as a christmas gift and unfortunately it does not play.I was not aware that the DVD was supposed to be for blueray only!?I even sent an email to the suppliers but customer service is a bust.I guess better luck next christmas.
5,Where is the DVD ?!?!,"This film is fantastic, far better than its sequel. And yet where is it? The sequel is available on DVD, but this is not. And according to the Disney website they are not currently planning to release it either.What can we do to get it released? Answers on a postcard!"
2,"By new, they mean newly copied.","I received the copy of the Lion King and could tell from the DVD case that this was not an original Disney DVD. You could tell that the artwork on the packaging was a color copy from an original. The DVD itself is also a copy. So the quality is decent, but not perfect. Since the Lion King is currently out of print, I would be suspicious of anyone selling a ""new"" Lion King DVD."
5,Super fast delivery.,"I was extremely happy with this seller. My order arrived very fast, within a few days."
3,"Horrifying ""Special Edition""","My husband and I popped this into the DVD player to watch one night when we wanted something friendly and comforting. The intro sequence with Zazu (minus his proper voice) was dull and endless, but we were most horrified to reach the scene with Simba's pouncing lesson to find a hideously extended version. We literally had to stop the DVD, it was so bad. We realized at this point that Disney had allowed the selection on this DVD to default to their new special edition. Hey Disney folks--if we want to see crappy extras, we'll go watch the special features.If the regular cinema version hadn't been on this DVD, I would have returned it in a heartbeat."
1,Blu-Ray doesn't play on Samsung Player (HT-BD7200),"Even after updating my Samsung Player (HT-BD7200) with the latest firmware this disc will not be played. I also have the Snow White Diamond Edition and it will not play. All my other Blu-Ray disc play fine. Shame on Disney for putting something on this disc that creates compatibility issues. Called Samsung technical support, but all they can do is say ""please wait for a firmware update'. I'm not holding my breath."
3,why so much?,great movie to add to my disney collection. Won't spend $40 for it new. I saw this movie as cheap as $12 new elsewhere.
1,Missing DVD,"When I received this DVD it was missing the discs. I paid basically for an empty case, which is extremely disappointing."
1,Blue Ray,"The Blue Ray Movie did not play on my Blue Ray. It kept on going back to the main menu no matter what! Fortunately, it came with a regular movie so my kids were able to watch it, but very dissapoint that the blue ray movie did not work."
4,"Damaged, most likely from shipping.","I ordered this DVD because I love this movie and want to hear it on surround sound. it was damaged when I received it. Literally looked like someone may have stepped on it. Not their fault, that's shipping. Though the didn't have another. They did, however return my full purchase, shipping and all so that I could find another. The promptness of my return emails were very slow. In the end, the right thing was done however so there really is no room for complaints."
1,disappointed-n-upset,"When I purchased this dvd I paid for a NEW movie and was under the empression that was what I would be getting, Instead what I received was a burned copy that was not sealed, even the cover and book inside were copies, The movie wont play the dvd player has a message that the disk is dirty.My child was and still is upset due to the fact that the movie wont play. I'm very disappointed and upset that people can and do take advantage of people."
1,the lion king,This video (movie) would not load in my dvd. the second disc (supplemental features) work fine.
1,"Why is it a ""masterpiece""?","I know I'm going to be picked on for saying this, but why is Lion King said to be a masterpiece and one of Disney's greatest? To be honest with you, I didn't really enjoy it that much. I didn't have a problem with the animation or the sound, it's just the story. The story is the most important element, here. But, Disney plaigerized the idea for this movie from another source, and didn't do a good job, to be honest with you. This movie was so boring and sappy that it sickened me. I found movies like Aladdin, Mulan, Lilo and Stich, and Home on the Range to be much more enjoyable than this."
4,ANOTHER VERSION,"Great DVD but you get a little tired of how Disney plays the marketing game. First, a few years ago they release most of their animated features on DVD with no real spectacular added features. But the kids have to have them. Then they go into ""moritorium"" so you can't buy them for awhile. Now they come out with the same animated features with all the bells and whistles so you have to buy these DVDs to make your kids happy.How many versions of the Lion King, etc. are their going to be?"
3,Movie is FANTASTIC! DVD features are...,"ABOUT THE MOVIE: The movie is wonderful! The colors are bright and beautiful and the characters are wonderful. It is a wholesome adventure. Five stars! I think you all know what it is about so I won't linger on that. This is one of Disney's (company's) last great films.ABOUT THE DVD: ""The wonderful world of advertising"" indeed! That review was right on."
2,liong king,hi when I by it said blue ray 3d but only one disc is 3d so very disappointed and 3d of first movie any way
5,the lion king special edition,this is a must buy if you are a major fan of lion king like me. this is the best Disney movie in my opinion.
4,Not as good as I would of thought in 3D,"This movie is one of my FAV Disney Movies! But its ok in 3D. not AMAZING, but def not bad. You can tell a difference with the 3D, but it wasn't a GOTTA HAVE one, I'm glad I waited for the price to come back down to $29 if your looking at getting this its your call but I really think just the Blu Ray would be enough IMO. Still a GREAT DISNEY MOVIE!"
4,The Lion King-Disney,This movie is epic. I ordered the 2-disc Platinum edition on Amazon. It was supposed to be wide-screen but is not. But I still love it. You must own this movie.
3,Scratched way too easy...,"Not sure if this was a refurbished copy or what, but there are tons of scratches on it... None of the other DVDs we have are all scratched up..."
2,Missing packaging and bonus DVD,"This purchase was not of value for $20. The DVD came in a CD cover that you can buy at the officedepot (you know the translucent ones you put a CDs and give someone). The picture of the product said ""The Lion King (special platinum edition"" with picture of the outer cover and dvd box etc. It may have even said additional bonus material. The DVD plays well and everything but it was definitely overpriced."
3,Lion King Movie,"This is a great movie. I received it quickly in the mail. However, this is the platinum edition with two DVD'S. One does not work at all. Luckily, it was the one with the extra scenes and behind the scenes video. The other video that contains the movie works fine. I will keep it. I guess that's what happens when you buy ""used"" merchandise."
5,Wonderful !!!!!,"I loved the Lion King it is definitely one of my favoritest Disney movies (and I have almost all of the animated ones) In my opinion this is one of the best in the past ten years if not 100 years. Just a comment to ""A viewer from Oklahoma United States "" Just to let that person know that Disney is putting Beauty and the Beast out on DVD October 8, 2002 with three different versions of the film (original, special edition, and one other i can't remember). Then later this year they are supposed to rerelease the Lion King (probably in a special ed.) and will most likely be released on dvd next year in October (like how Snow White was released this year). Thanks for your time!"
4,Classic movie,It's been a long time since I've watched this movie and I bought it for my son and he seems to be quite taken with it. This was a great purchase.
5,A TRUE DISNEY MASTERPEICE. A CLASSIC.,This is the best movie I have ever seen. Disney really outdid themselves. This movie will never be topped by Disney or anyone else. This has the best story of any movie to date. The story is a classic in itself. The characters are timeless and unforgettable. Not only does it have a great story and great characters it has a beautiful soundtrack. Who can forget the words to Circle of Life or Can You Feel The Love Tonight. This movie is truly a masterpeice.
2,"Lion King, Special Edition","The movie took the max time to get to me, and when it did it was supposed to have 2 discs, only had one......the seller volunteered to reimburse me 50% which would be great......not sure how long that will take though if it happens (I apologize, I know I am a very impatient person)"
3,"its ok but,",but its not what i wanted but the service was great! it was very nice of the guy to help me out with re purchasing.
3,"Great movie, BAD for 3D.","I'm a lover of 3D movies, I've seen dozens in the theaters and watched several more at home, but this is not suited for home viewing.When I saw this movie in the theaters I was skeptical how it'd come out, but it was actually pretty good. It was like watching a popup storybook because the 3D was flat images since it was converted from a 2D movie, unlike the wholly computer animated newer movies which are more easily rendered in 3D.But... in the home setting this just doesn't come off as nicely and doesn't work well. I would assume this is how other 2D -> 3D conversions would go also. For home viewing I'd recommend sticking to movies that were initially designed to be 3D."
2,A badly done read along DVD,"This DVD was a real disappointment. It seems like it was thrown together at the last minute. The story, and even the songs, are nothing but a montage of still pictures. The only good thing about this DVD might have been that you can learn foreign languages from it. The story and a couple songs in German, Italian, Castilian Spanish, and French are included. However, even that isn't perfect. I can speak German, and I noticed that a lot of words in the German story and songs were spelled wrong, or even in some cases, words were stuck together because someone forgot to hit the spacebar. For a $14.00 DVD, they didn't even bother to spell-check. Which is a real shame, because this DVD could've been a great tool to practice a foreign language."
5,Timeless classic,"This is a timeless classic. I don't even have kids but I love the older disney movies. Don't pass this up, or it will go back in the vault!!"
1,Movies not originally made in 3-D are not great!,"We bought this with high expectations, as we love the movie. Here is a tip for 3-D movie buyers - if the movie was not originally filmed in 3-D, it will not be that wonderful. Perhaps one exception is the Titanic, as the director in his usual professional way, took great care with every single frame. Most of the movies that are converted are just cranked out to make money. The Lion King had so few good 3-D effects, we were shocked. Our policy now is pretty much just to buy the movies that came to the theaters in 3-D."
3,Slightly Disappointing,"The picture quality was stunning. However, the DVD did not include the absolutely wonderful and funny song ""The Morning Report"" which became a delightful addition to the movie. The dialogue that was inserted in its place was really boring."
5,Breathtaking!,"I had not seen The Lion King in several years, and then, only on the inferior VHS version...What an amazing improvement! The sound blew me away! The color was so beautiful, I couldn't take my eyes away. It really gave me the chills. My five year old, though, was a little frightened by the sound and the scene at the end where the hyenas attacked Scar. She kept asking if there were hyenas here and did they eat people. Of course, she loved Pumba and Timon. I think it is a beautiful work of art, and this edition displays it brilliantly!"
2,Lion King - the movie -NEVER GOT IT......,I never received this movie and have sent numerous emails. I will not order again from Amazon unless this is resolved.
5,Lion King in Blu-Ray=Awesome!,"I was 9 years old when The Lion King originally came out, so I grew up loving it. Now that I have a little girl of my own I wanted her to experience the joy as well. Watching it in Blu-Ray on a flat screen TV with surround sound was amazing. During the opening song my little girls eyes were glued to the TV. I'm glad we bought this so we can share it with the next generation. :)"
3,Lion King,"The product had great shipping time. However, it skips mid movie and the picture quality isn't great."
2,Unsatisfactory,"My personal opinion I would not order anything from groundhigher. I ordered the movie, The Lion King for my 7 yr. old grandson. I was told I would recieve it by 4/21/09..Well it is now 5/04/09 and I have not received it as yet..I have sent one email to that person and no response..I just sent another one tonite. Doubt if I get a response on that one either..Very disappointed and I was gonna rate this a one but it came up 2 stars and not even worth that."
4,The Lion King Special Platinum Edition,I received my item and am completely satisfied with my purchase. I found the shipping time and communication process quick and easy. I appreciate the quality of my product and thank the seller for the opportunity to respond to his offer of product.
3,no title,"Not nearly as good as ""Beauty and the Beast"" or ""Aladdin"". Animation still terrific, but story was just plain hokey. Same-o, same-o about son being cheated out of inheritance by evil relative, but he triumphs in the end. Ho hum. However, the voice of James Earl Jones was, as always , rich and resonant. There will never be another voice like his. Jeremy Irons was the evil uncle, but I didn't recognize him, nor Mathew Broderick as the young son. There were a few good bits, like ""I'm at the shallow end of the gene pool,"" and a few laugh-out-loud places, but the story was just too ordinary. Nothing original here at all. The music by Elton John was very good though; lots of catchy tunes, no sappy drivel. The uncle was really the best voice and character in the movie. No strong female at all."
1,Good for kids who don't have the critical thinking skills to realize this is a terrible Disney movie.,"I saw this when I was a kid, but I had already formed critical thinking skills, so the movie was ruined for me. The mere fact that the story is plagiarized makes it lose all credibility. I don't know why that isn't talked about more, but regardless I don't think that this is all that people hype it to be. The musical actually is much more impressive and has a lot more creativity and talent behind it than this. Disney is responsible for some of the most influencial animated movies of our time and this does not deserve to be one of them. I'm suprised Disney did not rise from his grave to haunt the producers. At minimum, i'd call this one of the most overrated movies of our time. At most, it is a bloated perversion of credible animated film and a violation of the creative spirit that drives the animation industry forward."
4,lion king,dvd had scratches but plays gooddvd case was goodso over all good product for the gift for my girlfriends kid
5,Fabulous,"My son adored this movie, I adored the price. Very reasonable price and great quality. I will continue to purchase from here in the future."
5,Still singing a month later!,"This was one of my favorites as a kid and I bought it to watch with my husband. We laughed together, sang together, and I think cried a bit together! What a wonderful movie! And the special edition has some cool features on it, like a personality test to tell you which character you are most like!"
3,Doesnt look like original movie,I really like this movie for my son the only thing that i didnt like is that i wanted the original and this seems like its pirate not like the original box or movie other than that no scratches it was in really good condition the person i bought this from is FOX SELLER
5,Brings back Memories.,"I remember the first time I watched this I had just started first grade. I cried and it still brings me to tears over Mufasa. It is an all time classic and probably the greatest children's movie of all time so when I saw it coming out on DVD i knew i had to get it to share a part of my childhood with my niece and nephew. Also, admittedly I had to get a copy for myself too. It is one of those children's movies that you never outgrow and for everyone in the family."
5,Please note: the sketches are only copies of sketches,"This is an excellent DVD with plenty of special features. I just wanted to point out that despite how the wording sounds on the Collector's DVD Gift Set, the NINE sketches that you get are only lithograph prints of sketches. I found this out months after getting my DVD the day it was released.Still, the extra cost of this set did seem a tad low to have original sketches anyway. You get 9 wonderful prints that are 5x7"" each, plus an excellent 160 page HARDBACK booklet. You get your money's worth, no doubt about it. I currently have the sketches in a landscape frame behind my desk in my bedroom/office and they look really nice."
4,for my grandson,a very nice package and appeals nicely to young children. this has also kept many adults quite entertained many times
2,Disappointing Version,"Although the new version of this classic is beautiful (I don't care for it- don't like alterations of originals) I bought this DVD for the sole purpose of owning the original version in DVD format. This DVD claims to have both versions of the film and that the viewer will be prompted to choose one. However, the screen that is supposed to give the viewer that choice NEVER happens. I am very disappointed with this DVD and am hopeful to hear from the seller soon. Perhaps he/she didn't know about this issue."
5,Amazing,Got it very quickly. Exactly like the description. Like new. Would buy from this seller again.
5,Excellent Picture Quality.,I bought this for a gift and it was a real hit. I was lucky enough to getto view this movie and though the movie itself is not my favorite thequality of the blu-ray is very good especially on a high quality LCD TV.Great picture and sound.
5,A timeless classic,"The Lion King is the best cartoon movie Disney has ever made. Period. And, it is one of the best movies ever. Period. It is a timeless classic that everyone should watch and enjoy. It can be watched over and over, it never gets tiring or boring. Such a good movie. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
1,Lion King,"Was not happy with the quality of the 1st dvd at all. I have to say that James Shaw (at media_fun) sent me out a new dvd right away. Well, number 2 dvd also stoped in the same place the first dvd did. They did not seem authentic. On the DVD I purchase from Redford entertainment on the back was writting in small letters The lion king 2 Simba's pride, there was no writing on the back of The Lion King. I sent them both back and hope to get a full refund.Cheri Reynolds"
1,DVD didn't work,DVD I received was unbalanced and doesn't work. Makes a load noise when you put it in the DVD player. Waste of $25. Worthless!
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR!!!!!,"The Lion King DVD I received was not new as advertised - no factory seal, disks were scratched, no insert in the case and the video skips. The ship window was almost one month and it took the entire time.I tried to contact SAM's Storefront and received no response. She obviously does not value her reputation. I would NEVER order from her again! Gave her one star because I could not give zero!DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR!!!!!"
5,Best Disney Movie EVER!,"If I could rate this movie higher than 5 stars I would. I have been waiting almost ten years to buy this movie. It is the best Disney movie of all time! The songs are by Elton John, it has the voice of James Earl Jones, and it's Disney. Need I say more?This a movie for children and adults. I recommend that everyone own this movie...before it goes back in the Disney vaults FOREVER!"
1,dont mess with classics,"I give the original 5 stars, but why is disney taking all its classics and adding new songs to it? i was so dissapointed when i rented this and there were new scenes in it. i dont want ""new and improved"" i want the original, the one i watched when i was younger."
3,LionKing,"I had purchesed the Lion King DVD for my 15 year old niece. This is her favorite movie of all times. There was a problem with the DVD, the special edition portion of the DVD was fine but the original version there was no audio."
5,seller bn;s dvds,The Lion King (Disney Special Platinum Edition)purchase this dvd from bn's it arived in a short time after i order it excellent condition when it got here very nice company to deal with would not look around would next one from them it is nice to see companys care for the customer keep up the good work
5,Disappointing!,"I am an avid Disney fan, gave this as a gift to the children of a friend. The friend called my attention to the ""sun bleached coverart"" and the made in mexico quality of the video. I was appauled and mortified,took the dvd back, threw it away, and gave a gift card, from then on."
3,The product was fine.,The product was fine. The delivery time I thought was too long. I ordered on 2/2/2010 did not receive till 2/19/2010. I have ordered other products from other sellers in USA and it hasnt't taken as long.
5,would buy again!,"The DVD was opened, but it had no problems playing and included the bonus scene not featured in the original movie and also featured the 2nd bonus scenes dvd."
3,Why Disney Why???!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Why did Disney ruin this film by adding a terrible song, cutting dialogue, and making a terrible extras disc!Its sooo bad, it took me half an hour to find the deleted scenes, and i cant even find the original release on my dvd! (If anyone knows exactly where the original theatricial release is then pleaaaase tel me - email me sarahsezzy90210@hotmail.com - i'll be forever in your debt)But aside from the terrible dvd, the actual picture quality is great, and the original film is a classic, (although i do acknowledge that everything disney releases they call a classic)However, you may like the added song but i felt cheated by disney that theyd changed my favourite film, so it depends on your feelings about the original whether or not you buy this dvd"
2,got ripoff?,"ok,i had to give this two stars for one reason. sure it was a great film, but it was such a ripoff of Kimba, the white Lion. I am a huge anime fan, and when i saw this, me and my friend looked at eachother. had we seen this already? almost everything is identical. from the names simba and kimba to the faces of their father's in the clouds. everything is identical. disey should pay..."
1,No Blu-Ray For Me,"Blu-Ray disc did not work for me, not once, but twice on a returned item sent to me. Amazon was in fact amazing at getting this quick turned for me, but alas, I am returning it for a refund altogether. It appears that the Blu-Ray discs have a bad batch that won't play on three blu-ray players I own. Shame...was looking forward to it."
4,Great movie,"If you love disney's ""Lion King"", I think you would like to visit the original, Tezuka Osamu's ""Kimba the White Lion"".If you can not get satisfaction with disney's ""Lion King"", I recommend Tezuka Osamu's ""Kimba the White Lion"", the original of disney's ""Lion King""."
1,problem of online purchases,"the problem with online purchases is that it takes awhile to find out that the wrong item has been sent and by then you may have no recourse. I ordered a basic LION KING DVD for my 3 yr, old granddaughter but received a BLUE RAY disc which I've been unable to xchange"
1,Money Down the Drain!,"I was not at all happy with this product. I ordered The Lion King because I was always impressed with the graphics and soundtrack. The disks I received had a huge pause in one of the tracks and finally stop playing all together on the first play. I removed it from the player, made sure that it was clean replaced it and it never played correctly. I am not one to send things back because of the hassle but I expect that when I purchase something that it work properly. I did not get a chance to enjoy the movie at all. Money down the drain."
5,one of the greats,this movie has important values. this timeless movie came out when my sister was born. this is about the life of a lion cub that grows up to be king. the cub is simba he thinks the reason why his dad died is his fault. later he finds out that his uncle killed his dad because he wants to be king. i will let you see the rest of the movie do not want to tell to much
5,The Lion King Has Never Looked Or Sounded Better,"This Review is for: The Lion King (Two-Disc Diamond Edition Blu-ray / DVD Combo in DVD Packaging)I Grew up with the lion king, it was my favourite movie as a kidi saw it in theaters in 3D and it was EPICand this blu-ray is AWESOMEthe film has never looked or sounded betterIncredible REMASTERING, the film doesnt look like it's 18 years old, it looks like a new animated filmthis blu-ray also includes some new interesting special features (the out-takes are hilarious )i can finaly give away my VHS copy and watch this blu-ray for years to come.buy it."
3,Over-rated,"Ok, I'm losing patients with Disney(thought I do admit I never had much to begin with). The Lion Kind is very strong in some places but at the same time is very weak. The animation is excellent, some of the best to ever come out of Disney and the majority of the cameos are perfectly cast. However, The Lion Kind feels very recycled. The best example of this is the films villian Scar. Simply put, he looks and sounds almost exactly like Jafar did in Aladin(except he's a lion of course). Also while the film has a decent opening(though rather familiar) and a fairly well-done ending, there really isn't much of a middle to it. The Lion King is a good movie but doesn't deserve all the praise it has gotten."
3,Feedback,"Very disappointed because it was not a real Disney movie - this was a copy - a ""knock off"" - I don't recommend purchasing it."
1,"Never got the movie, service with Amazon was disappointing!!","The movie is great,cause I've seemed it somewhere else so i purchased this movie for my girls to have and keep seeing again.But this name Broderick probably has more items to sale don't buy from them.They took my money and never send me the dvd(movie)so I send a message to Amazon stating about the situation an got a message back,stating they have withdrawn from Amazon,Meanwhile they took my money and never returned it back."
1,Doesn't deserve good feedback,"This ""original"" movie is a fake! A cheat! A scam almost! Disney was in competition with the company creating Kimba: The White Lion. Kimba...Simba...wow. It really took a long time to come up with that. -_- Also, some shots of the show, Kimba, and the movie, Lion King, proved that it was rip. Even the thorns part of the movie was taken from Kimba! Lion Fink was a Disney Ripoff. They don't deserve your money. Save it for something better. MUCH better. Not Lion King 2 either. Believe me, listen to this review, and you've made the right choice. My advice: Don't Buy Any Lion King Movies. Whether it's 1, 2, 1-and-a-half, don't buy. 1 star. I could actually go on, but this is just brief."
1,Shameless Rip-Off,"Shameless rip-off of ""Jungle Taitei"" (""Kimba the White Lion"") by Tezuka. Any anime lover can tell. (Similarities in characters, scenes, and story lines are unbelievable.) Disney's response? ""Never heard of Kimba."" Oh, purleese. I'm kicking myself for paying Disney for this piece of swindle."
4,Walt Disney movies,"I chose this VHS not only because I'm a Disney fan but, also as a gift for sombody else. She loved it because it's a VHS she's not a fan of DVD's so it was the perfect choice."
5,I love this movie in 3D! Amazing picture!,"A week ago I went to the movie theater to watch this movie in 3D. Yesterday, I received my 3D blu-ray and watched in my Mitsubishi 73"" TV (WD-73740). And, I just love it.! The picture was just amazing! I think I liked it and appreciated better than when I went to the movie theater. This is a must buy if you have kids!"
4,"looks grear on a 50""e","Looks great on my 50"" plasma LG.blueray is the way to go love the movie,even more than the girls LOL :)"
2,Ok DVD,"This DVD does work but skips at times. We are able to watch it, but I am very dissapointed in AMazon for allowing people to sell things that don't work correctly."
5,FOR YOUNG AND OLD ALIKE..........,"I DON'T DO A LOT OF CARTOON WATCHING, BUT, THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW THAT I ACTUALLY ENJOYED WATCHING WITH MY KIDS ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASIONS.. A MUST SEE FOR EVERYONE"
5,the lion king,"propably one of the best animated motion pictures ever. I hated the addition of the new song, but I believe that was directed towards the younger audiences. Many extras, most i liked to watch"
4,Still the King,"When it was released in 1994, ""The Lion King"" was the most successful animated movie of all time, and that's hardly surprising. An inspired, vaguely-Shakespearean story, a gifted voice cast, five irresistable songs, and that flavor of Africa provided largely by Hans Zimmer and his South African cohort, Lebo M.This new trend of Disney's, releasing a series of immersive DVDs, is terrific for buffs like me. And between the behind-the-scenes featurettes, the deleted materials, and a whole section dedicated to the Broadway musical, I really have only one complaint...How the heck do you turn of ""The Morning Report?"" That is a terrible song, and the dialogue it replaces is infinitely better. Poor Rowan Atkinson."
5,Nice and commical video which anamation brings to life!,"This was an excellent movie although I thought it could have been a little longer. The movies good points is that its got lots of music in two catagories background and songs. The animation also plays a vital role in this movie for it simbolises things that real life characters and scenes cannot create. The dialog was funny and comical sometimes a little bit dull. In some stages the movie can be a drag and you dont have a clue wats going on! The story is also so well written and put into animation that you can truly bear all the emotion with Simba that he is going through. The animation in this film is there for childrens delight but I think children might not follow and understand the story line so well,I would rather say an adult would enjoy this movie better. All in all Disney outdid themselfs.I can give them a rating of 5 stars with a smile on my face."
1,Doen't work,It doesn't even work past the previews! I'm so pissed my little sister was dying to see it for christmas and we put it in and ta dah....NOTHING
5,Love it.,"As one of the biggest fans of Lion King I kind of expected more features, but it had a decent amount. Overall the quality is amazing and the story is still as good as it ever was. I'm glad they didn't include the Morning Report when watching it but it's still there as a feature somehow. But what can I say, if you haven't watched this movie yet, you absolutely must. It's for people of all ages. It has it all, action, adventure, romance, comedy, very good songs. It is truly an Epic."
3,Not as good as stage version,"A classic story that is very enjoyable to watch in 3d movie format, but not as good as major stage versions."
2,Short changed.,"This is fine if you have a BluRay player. They make it sound so great having two formats. But if you've only got a DVD player and you REFUSE to buy a BluRay player then you're short-changed. All of the extras are only available on the BluRay version. The DVD doesn't even have the normal extras you'd find a the rest of Disney's DVDs. Sorry but that isn't convincing me to drop several hundred dollars are yet another piece of electronic equipment and then spend a ton of money replacing all of the DVDs that I just bought to replace all my VHS tapes.I'll be selling this turkey and replacing it with the two disc DVD ONLY version. Lucky for me this was a gift (some gift) so I won't be out any money.Anyone want to buy a brand new, never played version of the LIon King, cheap?"
5,Fantastic!,"Anybody who loved this movie years ago when it was released, should definitely buy it on blu-ray. The colors are much more vibrant and the audio is much better. This is by far one of Disney's best movies, and it's even better in 3D.Probably the greatest thing about this Diamond edition is that Disney decided to leave out the extra ""Morning Report"" song, that had initially been included on the Platinum edition that was released a few years ago."
5,BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"BUY IT!REALY! ITS REALY WORTH IT!!!!!TRUST ME!!!!!I have been a Lion King FANATIC for 9 years now and I still LOVE to watch this movie!(don't lisin to the people who give this 1 star!!!!!I'm begging you!!!!Now,Lion King 1/2,THAT'S somthing to give 1 star to!!!!)This movie inspierd me to even draw animation and i'm doing great!!!!!!This movie even is in brodway!!!!!!!(BUY ONE BEFORE THEY RUN OUT!!!!!)"
5,King Forever,"The Lion King never gets old, and will stay in the hearts of all forever. The lively animation, and thrilling, suspensful enjoyment brought to young kids is enough for me to keep watching it."
5,An wonderful teaching tool!!!,"This is my all time favorite Disney movie. By far there best. I am a pastoral studies major at college and have to give sermons in my church. I have preached a sermon using a clip of the Lion King as an illustration and basis for one of my sermons. I used the clip where Raffiki is telling Simba that his father is alive because he lives in him. This is a wonderful illustration.I highly recommened this movie for entertainment/teaching/ or whatever else...The animation, the dialogue and the music is beyond measure to any other Disney movie I feel...I Can not wait until it comes out on DVD!!!!"
5,Grrreat!!!,Good fast download and acts as an awesome babysitter :-)I would certainly recommend this to anyone that has a kindle fire or amazon account
2,Poor Quality,I love the movie but the quality was very poor and not worth the money. Should have just gone to the store and bought it.
4,Great for kids,"I bought this 4-disc edition to be the first movie in my 3D set. With my 3 kids, from 12 to 4 years old, we put on our 3d lens and enjoy. The movie looks great, but it was drawn in 2D with parallel planes so when it was transformed to 3D you can see some characters and part of the landscape in 3D but the rest remain in 2D. At some parts looks weird, but it doesn't matter to my childrens. The Lion King was one of the first movies for my older son, he watched it so many times that he was able to remember every detail on songs and parlaments. For him it was like to see again an old friend and was the happiest with the movie, but all spent a great time watching it.Worth to buy the 3D set on BD, and also the DVD copy for the less careful kids. Digital copy requires to connect on Itunes, but was OK to me.We expect the next parts of the movie on 3D!"
5,planet books and music,I was very pleased. My order was mailed out promptly received promptly and in excellent condition. I would recommend them highly.
5,Great,This is an excellent movie. I remember when my mom took me to the theater to see it. I bought this movie to send to my niece who lives in Tanzania. She has never seen it. She loved it by the way. Disney did a great job with making the animals look like how they do in real life.
5,True Lion King Fan,I am a Huge Lion King fan and I love this product! My husband loves this product too. We were in the generation when The Lion King first came out and we were so happy when we found out it was coming out on DVD and BluRay.
3,3d does not play,"the 3d dvd does not play with my Samsung 3d dvd player. This is the first time that this happened with my 3d dvd player which was bought in 2011. 2d quality is excellent, though."
5,great product...3D really makes the picture stand out,great product...3D really makes the picture stand outran effortless and no reason not to like the movie if you liked the movie before
4,Classic Disney,"Very good example of standard Disney movie...not quite as much adult content as others (Pixar, etc), but very touching. Broadway play is also excellent (saw it in NYC). Highly recommended. Not sure why Disney has pulled it from the shelves - undoubtedly so that they can reissue it at higher price."
2,dvd plays bad,most of the dvd plays well..but once u get about half way thru it doesnt play at all it skips a lot and is unreadable..i wont buy from this person again
2,lion king,"well the disc is suppose to be a two disc set. I only got one disc of the lion king but did receive another disc with it ""a christmas carol"" which I haven't watched yet. I really believe that the copy of the lion king that I received is a copy because of this but am not sure. It also would not play on my newer disc player had to play it on an older one, not sure what that problem was."
1,The DVD was poor quality.,I bought this overpriced DVD for my granddaughter's birthday and it skips continually and would not play in her portable DVD player or in the car DVD player. This definitely was not worth the money.
2,Not for young children. Promos mask its real darkness.,"The advertisements for this film that you see on other DVDs and videos are purposely and horribly misleading. You buy this video expecting a joyous musical romp with animals of the Serengeti for your children. Plain and simple this is a movie of death. The lead character dies a horrible death and there are fights to the death. This is not a children's movie. See the first ""Editors"" comments. Compared to NEMO, artistically the animation is simply not that great. The background scenes are repetitious. Disk 2 is basically an advertisement for the musical. My youngsters never get tired the the original Disney Jungle Book. We've seen it hundreds of times. We viewed this movie once and that was enough."
2,What Happened to the Soundtrack?,"The songs in the original movie were NOT included in the ""Special Edition"" making this a bland shadow of the original. Shame on you Disney!"
3,It's Alright,I like the movie & think it is very exciting but the remake dvd edition I don't really care for the added songs & stuff. I like the original version better. the new song sound like a totally different person which it is. For the movie 5 stars for the remake 3 stars
3,Always Missing Spanish Version,Many of the new releases of Disney are able only in English or French language tracks. I have been looking for a store where I can find movies in DVD with Spanish version or subtitled because my kids and my family don't speak another language. All the Disney's movies are great and I love them but I'd like to make a collection with spanish version. This's my problem when I want to buy another movie of Hollywood too.
4,A very decent effort,"I did love ""The Lion King"" when I saw in the theatres upon its release, but I have a few concerns now that it is my two year old's favorite video. Many of the scenes do seem violent, especially the Hitler-like stance during the ""Be Prepared"" number. Also, this must set a record for the most times the word ""KILL"" has been uttered in a Disney film. I love this movie, but be careful who you show it to."
5,"Hands down, Disney&#65533;s best animation movie ever.","With a Touch of Hamlet and a sprinkle of King Lear, The Lion Kings is a real achievement in every aspect. A tale about coming of age and the right of destiny that has a real timeless effect on all age groups. Not only is this movie such a monumental film in animation but is an achievement in motion picture scoring as well. Elton John and Tim Rice not only bring a great soundtrack to this epic but accompanies it with a sense of style that has not be duplicated ever since its release.A real Disney classic in every sense of the word, and a real keeper for generations to come."
5,Great Movie,Good condition for used item. It was a gift for someone and they loved it. Besides its hard to find this movie on dvd anywhere. Great movie and love watching it with the kids.
5,The Lion King,How could this be anything but one of the best Disney movies - music is great - animation is perfect - great for family viewing anytime.
3,Overall product is ok,I really like this movie so i got it but was disappointed. the movie is fine and plays very good no problem but the the artwork of the movie cover and DVD disk look very cheap like if someone printed them out form home or pirated. The movie works and looks like original but artwork makes it look fake.
5,Hakuna Matata,After watching Aladdin and Beuty and The Beast I disn't know what disney could come up with. When the Lion King came out on video i watched it over and over again. This movie has some of the best animation I have ever seen in a disney movie and the Wildebeest stampede was one of the best climax seens i've ever seen. Take my advice and GET THIS MOVIE! (If your poor well......to bad).
2,Who is singing?,"Disney's Lion King was a great film before it came to DVD, especially with songs by Elton John. Now, for some reason, Elton John is not singing in this DVD release of the movie, it is some woman. I did not pay for this DVD to hear some woman sing. She ruined the movie for me. It's bad, trust me."
1,Disappointed,"The first time we watched the movie it worked fine. We just got a our Blue Ray a few days ago and so we decided to watch the ""Lion King"" again. It ran for a few minutes and all of a sudden it just stopped. A message appeared ""can't read disc"". My son said I can't return this because we already opened the package. Very disappointing."
2,very disappointed,"When I first heard that lion king was coming out on dvd I was excited because it was a favorite movie of mine. But now, since Amazon has tried to send 2 copies of it and both weren't working correctly because both graphics on dvd's weren't working correctly and both almost went out on me too so, Maybe I'll hold off on buying it for now or maybe try somewhere else."
2,"Boring. Don't fall for it, kids are bored with this","Yes, I admit, the new age ""circle of life"" stuff is horribly predictible and trite. But if the music were shorter, more enjoyable, and the story paced faster, the new age junk wouldn't matter.But in this movie, the circle-of-life stuff just keeps... circling right back to us, the audience, over and over and it gets old fast.I know I'm in the minority here. I don't rate this as a classic. I typically give the benefit of the doubt to movies and I typically rate them higher than they deserve. Actually, I'm doing that here too by not giving it ONE star. But the animation is good enough to warrant the second star on its own, the story is worth 0."
3,Not bad !!!,Length:: 0:10 MinsCute animation from Disney ( but not my favorite Disney animation )............also great 7.1 sound and the 3D is okay !!
1,Lion King,"I was led to believe that the DVD was new, however on watching it, it has an error in it. I'm disappointed."
1,The Lion King Special Plat edition,DisappointedMovie was awesomeUnable to view/listen to finale due to damgaged diskNo info included on how to return for exchange or refundReverend BEMartin
5,Worthy Entertainment,"Purchased for my great grandaughters birthday but sat down and watched it with her. We both loved the music, the story, the characters. Loved every minute of it. Nothing dull, boring or scary. Just pure entertainment. A movie to be enjoyed by all ages. So necessary and so unusual in this day and age. Thank you."
4,It's the Lion King!,"After having trouble finding it in stores, I went to trusty amazon. Not only did it arrive promptly, but it arrived in perfect condition. It has a beautiful blu ray transfer, in my opinion, and for further info, I also enjoyed the Beauty and the Beast transfer. It has a dazzling main menu, and I haven't tried the 3D, but I hear it's good. The best part is the Digital copy, I can take the pride Lands with me where ever I go!"
4,The Lion King 3D awsome!,The Lion King is one of my favorite animated movies. It looks good in 3D but since it's animation and kind of the old film you don't get the same effect as with the new movies coming out or the imax films but it's still good.
4,It's a classic!,We havent opened the DVD yet because it is a Christmas gift for my son. He is 2 and saw the Lion King recently in the theatre and absolutely loved it.
5,Daughter Loves it,"We bought this Blu-ray for my 2 1/2 year old daughter because both her mother and I grew up when this movie first came out and remembered how much we loved it as kids. The first day I think she made us watch it around 5 times and we were right she loved it just as much but probably a little more than we did. One feature that I really like especially since I have a younger child they have a feature where it just goes from song to song instead of viewing the whole movie, she loves this part almost as much as seeing the whole thing."
1,Dumb and Overrrated,"(...)We had seen the Toy Story movies and Chicken Run and were anxious to see this one, which is supposed to be one of the greatest cartoons of all time. Not so at all. It's a stinking musical! Every other second there is a song. The most annoying are 'Morning Report', ' Circus of Life', and 'Hakuna Matata'. The movie is quite obnoxious, with its vulgar characters and its violence.(...) I can't believe it received a G rating. Should be more like PG, I think. If you are looking for a good, wholesome cartoon for your children, pass this one up. Get the Toy story movies instead. Those are funny and entertaining, with good morals."
1,Racist Propaganda,"Note the accents of the different animal races.Note the accents of the hyenas. (what ethnic groups do they represent?)What happens when the races are mixed? (devastation to the land)What happens when the races are again segregated? (happiness)The rabbit hole goes much deeper, this is just a small taste of the hidden messages in the film."
1,Have you seen Kimba?,"I have not seen Kimba... The Lion King Killed ""Kimba the White Lion"" and then ripped off his story and spit it out. Shame on Disney. Help me rediscover Kimba once again."
4,Epic,"The best Disney animated film ever...This film had it all, it was funny, emotional, had family drama, and above all, great animation and songs! My personal favorite character is Rafiki, the Baboon! I still cant forget the line he says to Simbe, ""Past can hurt, but as I see it, you can either run from it, or learn from it!"" it is so true! i loved Zazu's weirdness, and shenzi's humor, above all, i loved Pumba's innocence and Timon's intelligence! In short, i found the film the best film ever... The voice cast is also great. Mathew did complete justice to Simba, and what can I say about Mufasa, He is the best King, and dad anyone can ever get! The movie is not meant for kids, its meant to teach every adult a lesson...to find our place in the great ""Circle Of Life"". Thank-You Disney For The Lion King."
3,The Lion King,"The disk case was in good condition only thing did not play in the regular dvd player have to look at it on my personal dvd player. I was very disappointed that the second disk was very scratch up, otherwise it played without freezing both disk did play good. I gave it 3 stars for the disk being so scratch up."
5,Great,This was a great Disney film-the other Lion King 2 video didn't live up to it. Excellant music & great characters to remember.
3,3 yr. old not very interested in it...,I purchased this movie for my son who is 3. For some reason he is not that interested in it.. I don't know if it's because there is more singing than in his other movies or what. He loves The Land Before Time and Finding Nemo but this one falls flat. Maybe he just needs to be a little older... hopefully that is the case because this is a good movie. Might need an older audience though..
2,Its a fake...,"We bought this under the led assumption that this was an original copy of the movie. It is very apparent it is not when looking at the printed cover. Someone who has never seen the real casing may not even realize that its fake, but the pictures are very blurry. The dvd works great but the credits skip badly. I basicly paid $30+ for a copy of The Lion King. If that is what I wanted I could have gotten that for free!"
3,Looked unlegit to me,"We bought this DVD after it'd been locked in Disney's idiotic vault. We paid through the teeth for it but we wanted our son to not grow up without being able to enjoy such a great movie. The DVD was obviously produced outside of Disney's system. The dvd case and label on the DVD just wasn't quite professional. I'm surprised that these folks are able to get away with it! Still the quality when watching is good and though I pride myself on not stealing music, movies or anything else without the proper people being paid it serves Disney right for locking these movies up and not letting people that would love to purchase legitimate copies to do so."
2,Doesn't work.,I bought this for my classroom and it doesn't play on my computer or a DVD player. Very disappointed with this manufacturer.
5,absolute favorite,"This movie was a long time coming for me on Blu-Ray. I couldn't have wanted more. Disney has done an exceptional job in every aspect of bringing my favorite animated film to HD. Giving the film the respect it deserves. All the colors and detail pop and with the sound as quite something to behold. From the rumbles of the stampede to the crispness of every lyric and beat of each song. Once again, well done Disney! Just waiting for Aladdin this spring! (What are YOU talking about? hehe)"
5,The Excitement Continues,"The farmers of Kanna continue their search for seven samurai to protect their homes from ""The Bandits."" By the end of this DVD I think the search is over but some recruitment needs to be completed. I believe that we are still in the characterization phase of this show as we are getting to know more about the characters but plot development is a little bit low.The characters are still as rich and the story is still as interesting as what roped me in to this series in the first place. I can't wait to move to volume 3 and continue this show."
2,B O R I N G!,"Duncan takes 324 turgid/boring pages and way too many graphs to communicate the obvious: A dollar-based world-economy cannot last while the U.S. is running very large and increasing1)Trade deficits2)Government deficits3)Household deficits, and4)Business deficits (eg. pension funds).Much of the world (especially Asia) is financing economic expansion through sales to the U.S. by loaning us the money. Each of those nations will eventually become increasingly nervous about others' bailing out of dollars before they do - leaving them holding a bag of worthless paper. And if you don't believe me, read Paul Volker (former Federal Reserve Chairman) - he thinks the odds of a dollar-crisis in the next five years are about 75%."
5,Well Researched,"Duncan does an excellent job of explaining in a technical but understandable way the current dollar crisis. Worth the read, but the reader will need a basic understanding of economics to truly understand the book."
4,Reads like a Stephen King book,"""The Dollar Crisis"" is a horrifying prediction for the future of the global economy. Richard Duncan states the current American trade deficit has caused a worldwide credit bubble which will pop and when it does, we can look forward to a global recession as well as deflation.I picked this book up because Robert Kiyosaki recommended it. The book certainly reads like an economics textbook so be sure to have a economics dictionary close-by if you aren't an economics major.This book is filled with lots of data and graphs, although Mr. Duncan tends to repeat himself. His interpretations of the data seem to be logical although he takes the stance that the worse case situation will happen. Mr. Duncan also has an interesting hypothesis regarding how the Fed seems to have lost control of interest rates.While you may agree or disagree with Mr. Duncan, this book is a must read for anyone wanting to look at where we may be going economically in the future. 4 out of 5 stars."
3,"Great Information, but too verbose","Extremely well argue point of view for the skeptics. However, The author, literally, (no exaggeration) restates the abstract/conclusion of the book at the beginning and end of every chapter. Needless to say, it gets a bit repetitive."
3,Worth the read,"This book was worth the read because of its many useful charts, tables, stats, etc. The book does shed some light on a very serious and important topic that we all will have deal with probably sooner rather than later.Kudos for all the hard work put into developing a strong argument against fiat currency. Yet, the solutions offered by the author are simply recycled, failed marxist policy. The liquidation will occur and nothing government can do will either prevent it or ease the pain of it. Period.Strange end to an otherwise readable work."
5,Utterly brilliant,"Despite the fact that the last revisions date from March 2005, Duncan nailed not only the 2008 crisis but all that has come since, including QE2, the inflation/deflation conundrum, and more. Awesome analysis and well worth reading today."
5,Best book I've read...3 years too late,Mandatory reading for investors trying to understand how governments manipulate monetary policy and the effect upon asset prices.
5,Read between the lines,"Having traded currencies successfully for the past 20 years, I found this book to be a credible resource. With the U.S. deficit spiraling in the wrong direction, we need to be aware of all the possibilities to create optimum contingency plans. This book will provide you with the information to make the informed decisions."
5,A Must Read,"An excellent explanation for a lay reader, myself, on the enormity of our impending fiscal crisis. Greenspan is getting out just in time."
1,Excellent Analysis and Excreable Solution,"The author does an excellent job of analyzing why the U. S. dollar will crash, explaining very well the factors that will lead to such a crisis. His proposed solutions, unfortunately, recommend the same factors that will cause the crisis in the first place. He is employed by the World Bank and I am sure that his book and its proposed solutions were approved by it prior to its publication.Winston Churchill is reported to have said of noted academic of his time that ""he knows everything and understands nothing."" Unfortunately, this book discloses the same tendencies on the part of its author."
4,Great job outline the problem,"Mr Duncan does a wonderful job explaining the coming ""Dollar Crisis"". I disgree with some of his recommenditions. A great book over all"
5,Sobering Analysis,"This book is not for the already depressed. It paints a stark picture of the dangers ahead of us....and the financial muck we are up to our ears in!This book should be read by every Reagonomics fan out there....so they can see how flawed their economic theory is...Overall, this book presents a lot of analysis to back up it's arguments. There are lots of graphs/charts throughout the book...so it's not a quick read....it's more of an academic study in my opinion.."
3,Tedious and Too many Graphs,"This book is very tedious and wont give you the answers that you are looking for if you are wondering about the current economic situation in the world today. Great for book worms and economics fans, but not for the average person. Too many charts and graphs; almost every other page has a chart. I recommend ""Petrodollar Warfare"" as a great book to start with if you want to understand how the US got into the economic mess it is in."
5,fun for kids,The grandkids love playing with this product. I was surprised to find that it comes in colors too. They can create so many fun things.
3,Fun while it lasted,This clay was fun while it lasted which didn't turn out to be very long. It dried out pretty quick and could not be worked with anymore. The intial playing was a blast and educational too.
4,So far...,So far it's been a very useful reference to have. Especially when you didn't have enough time in lab to examine the models.
3,Too much front matter,"For someone who understands the theory behind Cranial-Sacral, there is too much talk and not enough action in the video."
1,"Tastes good, but high in trans fat","I thought eating more fish would be good for my diet. If you feel the same, then stay away from this product. Each filet has 1.5g of trans fat. I read a lot of labels and have not seen anything that high in a long time.Will eating one filet kill you? No. But if you want a healthy diet free from trans fat you should probably stay away. Especially considering it is a box of 6-7 filets.But they do taste good..."
2,B O R I N G,"Being a fan of true crime, I picked up this book thinking ""this should be an interesting read"" however, it was the exact opposite. The Author never really gave much depth to the characters.....maybe they just didn't have any depth. We never find out the reason for Kristen Rossum's raging drug abuse (although it was hinted that an injury ending her chances at becoming a ballerina did it). So what she comes off as, is a spoiled child (which is probably the real reason for her drug abuse)who marries a man, who helps her (for awhile), get off drugs -- which she repays by killing him -- so she could be with her married lover. Sounds like a soap opera....a bad one. If you really want to read a good true crime try ""Dead and Buried"", ""Lethal Intent"" or ""Scream at the Sky""....definately interesting reads."
3,Felt Something Was Missing,"I don't know if it was the content, the writing, or Kristen Rossum's soul, but this book just didn't come across to me as very memorable. I saw the story on Dateline or some other show, and that's why I bought the book. I wanted to get the rest of the story, but there really wasn't much more there. I found the book overall to be unsatisfying."
2,Author tends to be repetitive!,"This book is a love story between a man and a woman. Intertwined in the love story are subplots of drug addiction, infidelity. deceit, manic behavior, and murder. These negative behaviors are attributable to the woman in this love story, Kristin Rossum.Portrayed by her family and some friends as the ALL AMERICAN GIRL, with high expectations for success; Kristin is just the opposite. She lacks morals, the ability to tell the truth, and to truly love anyone except herself.I found it interesting to read that she and Scott Peterson are corresponding back and forth from prison. As the saying goes, ""Birds of a feather..."""
5,Spiritually Fit,"Donald Whitney asks ten questions that examine and probe the Christian like a medical doctor would his patient to bring about a healthy result. This is a solid read and is not based upon a modern spiritualized ""self-help"" measure. Each question is biblically based and presents a real challenge to the sick as well as healthy Christian. Whitney states, ""Nothing in the world is more important than an eternal, life-giving knowledge of God, through Jesus, who is the only way to the Father. I urge you not to take for granted the existence of such relationship between yourself and God. The Bible implores you to 'make you call and election sure.'"" Anyone wishing to take a true examination of their spiritual health will do well to read and re-read this book with the Bible in hand. But be ready to discover you may not be as healthy as you think you are in your spiritual health. The Christian looking to become healthy in their relationship with Christ will want read this book."
1,Not worth the money!,"Being a Civil War buff, I was so excited to get this set as a gift. The excitement disappeared when I watched the first disc. The whole series presents the Civil War out of order. Found out that the History Channel combined two different series into one set. Can't believe they couldn't get the discs in chronological order. Not much attention to detail on the covers. They misspelled McClellan's name on the back of disc 5's cover.Compared to Ken Burn's series, this set should not be on the same shelf. It should be hidden away or shredded.Not a Happy Camper"
2,dissapointed,"The first 2 discs (4 episodes) were exactly what i was expecting. True to life re-enactments. Very good.The problem with this History channel series is when it get to the 3rd and 4th disc. There are no more re-enactments. Instead its mostly narration by Danny Glover. The last two discs, half of this series is very boring and not as clean and crisp as the first two discs.Pass by this"
2,Not A Great Series......,"I have to agree with most of the other reviewers on here that this series, though reasonably priced, is not really worth your money. Most of the problem with it is not its quality or production that is quite good. It has more to do with the series being more of an odd pick of some essential battles of the Civil War, rather than a documentary done in some chronological order. It more resembles parts of a much bigger series, lets say with 15 episodes for example, where 6 are just chosen at random and sold as a collection. I would only recommend purchasing this series if you can find it used, and at a substantially reduced price..."
2,Technical problem in DVD production,"DVDs 4,5,6 do not run on my dvd player because of blocked dvd-area code for Europe (Germany).DVDs 1,2,3 are running perfectly."
1,Wrong image and wrong S&W model -- one star because zero was not a choice,"The HKS product listing says it is for four S&W models including the 63. But the S&W Model 63 in .22LR ,like the Model 317, holds 8 shots. I bought this loader for a Model 63(assuming there were 8 bullets in the image), but what I got only held 6 bullets. Also, according to the S&W catalogue,the model 43 is also an 8 shot, and I could not find a S&W Model 34 or 35 pistol. Since the Model 63 is the same ""J"" frame as the Model 317, I ordered a ""317 8 Shot 22LR Speed Loader"" by Ultimate Speedloader from Amazon--their listing says it is for both models and their image shows 8 bullets. By the way, the HKS packaging also says S&W Model 63--the error is not Amazon's, and Amazon gave excellent service in dealing with this problem!"
2,product not as shown,"Be aware that the picture of this product shows it to be the Canon toner cartridge, but it is not. It is an after-market product in a plain box and after-product container. The toner transferred properly to the printer, so this is not a review of the toner itself (I see no obvious problems so far), but only to make potential users aware that the shipped product is not as shown on the picture."
5,The path to Love,"The book Flower Child has been written by an original ""hippie"", a woman who tells her incredible inspiring, story of the true essence of the ""hippie"" movement. That of love. Farida Sharan humorously and generously shares insights of her profound life struggles, healing herself physically from breast cancer and emotionally from low-self esteem. Her spiritual quest to find Love was realized. Few hippies ""stayed the course"" Farida did and her story is provocative, enlightening and real. One can read her book for enjoyment, inspiration or guidance and direction but one must read her book."" Dr. Janice Fletcher"
3,Sixties book,This book is ok but not really as good as I expected from what some people said about it in my yahoo group.
5,A first hand look into the reality of the 60's,Farida Sharan writes a book that is honest and true to the ideals desired for from the turbulent 60's. True Life stories are always interesting to me but this one.... what an adventure! I looked forward with anticipation each time I sat down to read. It's the best book about the summer of love that I have ever encountered.
1,Too simplistic,I have been planning parties for years and do a lot with my family and wanted some new and fresh ideas. I was disappointed with this book. The ideas were unimagative and bland and I did not get one good idea from this book. If you are already creative person this book is not for you. Maybe it would be good for someone less creative. It made me think that I should write a book myself.
1,Not creative enough,"I bought this book for my sister who had earlier in the year had said she wanted it. When she received it on Christmas she said she had already bought it and that it had few new or interesting creative party planning ideas. She said she could write a better book than this with better ideas. I think maybe if you have little to no experience planning a party then this book is for you. Otherwise,save your money."
1,A summary of major contributors to religious studies,"This book attempts to be a sort of phenomenology of religious studies, relating briefly all the major theorists/theories concerning religious studies. Unfortunately, Capps takes on more theorists than a book this size can cover well, and ends up including entire sections that are completely vacuous.In addition, it's poorly written, with many typographical errors.It's a good idea, just a poor performance"
3,A great start but far too many typos/too little defn's,"Zwanzig shows great mastery of the material and his explanations are great. They help explain the material well.But the big problem here is that there are just so many typos. When you want to follow complicated arguments, it can take forever to figure out what he means precisely/mathematically.Also, there is not the slightest attempt to keep units correct or fix a representation, so one finds inner products between objects that don't really make sense. They are never formally defined.It's a great book to get the ideas from and some simple derivations. I'm still working my way through parts of it. But unless you have a complementary book to guide you, especially through Ch. 8, or you are already familiar with the material, you may get lost...I would suggest Berne/Pacora Ch. 11 for help in Ch. 8"
4,"Good intro for non eq stat mech, but not stand-alone","I have taken and TA-ed statistical thermodynamics and nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and have found Robert Zwanzig's book to be the best introduction to the nonequilibrium side of things. Clarity is the goal here, without the detail of Kubo's Stat. Phys. II, and MUCH clearer than the latter chapters in McQuarrie. However, a student will get much more from this book if he or she has at least some background in quantum mechanics and, needless to say, in statistical thermodynamics.Without getting into much detail, Zwanzig focuses on the fundamental concepts in a clear exposition. If you are taking yourt first course in nonequilibrium stat mech, this is the book you should buy. If, however, you have some reasonable experience with the subject, this book is not worth as much, since it is designed to be pedagogical. In that case, Van Kampen's Stochastic Processes in Physics and Chemistry is best."
1,refrain,"This book is filled with filth, and the writing borders on childish... It does not even amount to pretentious. granted I couldn't finish the book, I was both too disgusted and too bored. this book was recommended to me by a colleague who suggested I review the materials. I'm sorry I did."
1,go to the source: oploftbed.com,Go to to oploftbed.com. They are the true authors of these plans plus they sell the bolts cheap. You only have to buy the lumber at hd or lowes. They also have pictures and reviews of people who actually have assembled these beds.
2,I'll need to buy a different plan,"The plans were received via email as the seller mentioned. However, the major problems with it are 1) the drawings are not particularly clear to the novice as to how exactly each board would fit into the pattern. I would suggest using actual photographs as guides to show each step of the process. And 2) there's no mention that the bolts used for the plan (3 7/16"") are NOT easily found. I checked 7 different hardware stores in the Chicago area and not one had them in stock. They would have to be special ordered. The cheapest I could find the bolts for order were for $8 apiece. If I followed the plans as written buying just those bolts alone would cost OVER SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS! This plan, as written, will not save you very much money."
1,order of plans,"I ordered these plans on August 3 2010,It is aug 20,2010 and have NEVER received them!!!! I will NOT buy ANYTHING from this seller."
4,tom shear is improving,lets face it.. tom has alot of talent.. but his songs get boring.. i mean who can listen to his albums in one sitting? not me. while each song is different.. there is a repetitive trait among them that prevents me from wanting to hear more then 3 of his songs at a time.. but this new song.. is awesome. i can listen to the whole single and not get tired. tom is improving. i just hope the new album is done in the same fasion.
1,This is not a Grateful Dead Album,"If you want to hear Grateful Dead recordings spliced together, listen to the brilliant Anthem of the Sun. The only value this CD offers, is when you play it, after the first edit, you want to take it off, and put on a real GD CD.I currently have 50 Grateful Dead CD's loaded on my IPod, I will not load this one."
3,An American Dream,"A next sweet story of a none made it hight on arrival in New York.Sometimes funny, sometimes tragic.Might be seen if none is to watch at all."
1,"Tried three times, couldn't finish it.","This is the only Coen Bros movie I have ever really disliked, and that is a major understatement. I don't think I've even gotten half-way through it before it annoyed me to distraction, and I mean to the point that I was ready to contemplate my navel.To me, this movie is like trying to watch someone run their nails across a chalk board...over, and over, and over, and over...and over!If I were the razzies, or whatever the award for bad movies is, this would take every category and break every record. This is like watching a corny musical Scenes from a Mall, which may be the actual worst movie of the 80s. This is the one for the nineties. I tried again a couple of years ago to watch it, because I couldn't believe the Coens could create something so unwatchable, and yet, again, it was.Someone explain to me why I need to change my perspective or whatever it would take to find redeeming qualities in this movie?????????????"
2,"Silly, Sorry, Skip It","This is not one of Newman's better flics. The plot is ridiculous, the acting is so so and the characters are actually annoying."
3,Three Star Cohen Bros,"The Hudsucker Proxy is somewhat formulaic in the way it delivers it's story, with nothing really surprising in much of the plot or stylized windy dialogue. It's not bad, but it's not great either. Thankfully it throws in one or two curve-balls, but there are more forced laughs than clever moments. I'd give it three stars for the three stars: Newman, Robbins and Leigh. It does take a few unconventional turns in reaching it's predictable ending, but outside the hula-hoop, there's not much of a twist in this story."
3,Stylishly great but way too long!,"I love the Coen Brothers but I feel asleep twice during this movie. It was beautifully filmed and art directed but the story was very slow. It should have been edited wayyyyy down from it's length to keep my interest. I'm not much a Tim Robbins fan but he did a great job as did Paul Newman. Jennifer Jason Leigh was a bit tough to watch as much of her acting seemed forced. Charles Durning was great as always! i waited 16 years to see this but definitely not on my ""watch again"" list."
5,Best freaking movie ever.,"There are only a few people who can capture late 30's camp this well, and the Brothers are among those people. It's witty, quick and endearing. I love Tim Robbins and Leigh is incredible (and hot) throughout the whole movie. AND... it's got Bruce Campbel in it... for any of you fans out there."
5,"from mailroom, to Company President, to suicidal","A hilarious story of a nobody being promoted from a mailroom boy to the big cheese. After inventiong the hula hoop he finds out he was only moved tothis new spot as part of the plan to ruin the company. I cannot tell how it ends or you will be spoiled. The ending, however is quite exciting and funny."
1,Pathetic,"Badly written -- the screenwriter evidently considers loud, inane wisecracking to be biting satire (it's not).Badly directed -- the director seems to have thought large, empty sets would nicely set off against the long, empty script (it doesn't) and to have persuaded every single actor that loud and over-broad, with lots of distracting physical schtick thrown in for good measure, was just what his/her role required (it wasn't).Badly acted -- the actors without exception seem to have had the mistaken impression that they were in a Broadway theater with the whole audience packed into the last rows and their ""craft"" required shouting every line and over emphasizing every movement and posture (they weren't and it didn't).But, except for the inane screenwriting, inept direction, and inapt acting,..."
1,A BAD MUSICAL WITHOUT THE MUSIC,"THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT. i RESPECT TIM ROBBINS CHOICE OF ROLES, THE COEN BROTHERS ARE ALWAYS BETTER THAN THE REST. I KEPT WAITING FOR THE CAST TO BREAK OUT IN SONG, IT HAD THAT FEEL TO IT. IT MIGHT HAVE WORKED AS A MUSICAL. SORT OF LIKE ""HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING."""
1,HUDSUCKER PROXY,"Good evening,I have nothing to review for this item because I just never got, so far, this DVD that I ordered through Amazon!!!By the time I ordered it, it must be lost by now.It's odd that you are just asking me to review this title specifically as this is just the only item I've to report as lost among the stuff I oredred at amazon over the last 4 years as very regular and serious customer (you can check it). Ironic isn't it?By the way it's time now for me to ask you for a replacement!What are you about to do in such a case?Greetings,Thierry Schreurs"

5,Quirky Coen Brothers Classic was Made for the Adults....,"....but kids can get in on the tongue in cheek fun, too. It has touches of ""It's A Wonderful Life"", ""Meet John Doe"" (w/ Gary Cooper) and ""His Gal Friday""....but being a part of the Coen cosmos, expect to be laughing at something unusual. It is surprisingly a great holiday fable that I predict will gain more popularity as a ""must show"" each year. Tim Robbins is cast perfectly as the rube with a lucky streak placed in a situation where every one is, more or less, corrupt, bankrupt, bureaucratized. Jason Leigh has that Rosalind Russell banter/swagger down cold and Paul Newman does corporate corruption well. Look out also for the Betty (""pop 'im one"") Boopish Anna Nicole Smith in a walk on. The moral of the moovy is...thank gawd evvrybody don't use Polygrip..."
5,both thumbs up,"recently became fan of the Coen brothers. This one is great, very well done, already a favorite. I highly recommend it."
4,On time and in good condition,"This product was delivered on time, I think it actually might have been a little early. It was also in very good condition when it got here. The disc had no problems."
4,Great Movie,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE. This is the type of movie you sit down and watch with friends. If you like movies like ""Strange Brew"" and ""Ferris Buller's Day Off"" you'll enjoy the Proxy.A little slow in the very begining and in the middle buy well worth it in the end."
3,Am I Missing Something?,"I am a huge Coen Brothers fan, I love all their movies ( Blood Simple,Raising Arazona The Man Who Wasn't There, Barton Fink, Oh Brother, Big Lewbawski), but not this one, yet this movie seems to get the highest ratings. The sory didnt seem to have much substance, the humour was more cute then funny, The female reporter had the most anoying accent/voice. The story line i found to be too far fetched and full of holes. It was almost impossible to watch it the second time around. I'm glad i did watch it though, as I am a Coen Brothers fan. I would recomend that you hire the movie first, but going by reviews there is a 99% chance that you will love this film, I must be in that other 1%."
3,sort of the doctrine of the immaculate corporation in comedy form?,"In the 1950's American corporations could do now wrong.Two of the inventions claimed by Norville Barnes are actually WHAM-Oproducts made by a novelty toy company in the late 50's early 60's( HULA HOOP and FRISBEE).The idea here of a fall guy or scape goat is not new historically,but here the result turns out differently than anybodyhad planned. The suicide of the owner and president ofHudsucker starts the movie. We even at the endhaven't a real clue what leads the successful manto take his life ( except for the Blue Letter)?I liked the movie but in these times when Americais closing up manufacturing here and moving them to cheap labor countries,I think that seeing that the people who are doing this care for nothingbut how much they are getting out of itmay not be good for ordinary people to seeeven in comedy? Tim Robbin's makes a very good fall guy..."
3,Jennifer Jason Leigh is amazing!,"Jennifer Jason Leigh is so amazing in this movie. This movie tries to be one of those old screwball comedies from the 30's and 40's. It does it very well and Jennifer Jason Leigh does it perfectly. Her intelligent, loud, deep-voice, fast-talking, wise-cracking, head-strong character reminded me so much of Katharine Hepburn in films like ""Holiday"" and ""The Philadelphia Story"". She even got the accent right. I thought there could never be another Katharine Hepburn, but Jennifer Jason Leigh has almost nailed it. Amazing! Who would have thought that that young blond actress from ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" would have come so far? I'm really impressed."
3,"Good, but not great; too much style, not enough substance","A decent holiday movie, something of a forgotten one. This film makes an honest effort to pay homage to stuff like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Meet John Doe,"" but the movie at times feels as though it is trying too hard to emulate these classics. As a result there tends to be too much emphasis on the style in which the movie is made, and less on the acutal plot and content. Jennifer Jason Leigh does a decent job with her fast talking dialogue. To summarize, it's not that bad, but it's also certainly no ""Fargo""( which is excellent!) in terms of overall quality."
5,This oil is a must have item for gun maintenance.,This was a great buy for the price. I have used this product since the 1970s. The oil will work on anything that needs preventative maintenance on metal surfaces. The oil is very thin and it will find its way to hard to get to places if needed.You can always trust Remington products.
5,(5/5) WOW! Rem-Oil Spray's Awesome!,"This product is great! Does what it says and doesn't make a mess! It comes with a tube to fit on the spray nozzle so you can concentrate the Rem-Oil to your desired location! Rem-Oil will definitely decrease the wear on metal-to-metal contact.Pros:- Great cleaning and lubing solution!- Spray can comes with a plastic tube you can attach for more precise applications- You can use it for just about ANYTHING! (This product works so well, it will replace your WD-40!!!)Cons:- None (aside from price)Recommendation(s)/Suggestion(s):- Use this to lube just about everything! (No, not to be used on latex or humans (-_-""))In other words, this product is superb!"
5,can't go wrong with gregory alan isakov,"i keep buying these albums and they are just incredible. can't go wrong, when the mood hits there is no better singer to smooth your soul. great lyrics and very well balanced effects / music."
5,little feathers woman,"a well written book, a great read. I agree with Grannysmith. I highly recommend this book."
5,wonderful,"I just finished the book. It was so easy reading, i finished it in no time. I was glued to it from first page to last page. The story line was excellent. So funny, i almost want to read it again."
3,Good humour,"This was a good comedy that I enjoyed. If you have lived in a developing country it is funny. I enjoyed the silly oversexed diplomat (who wasn't far off the mark of some single diplomats around the world), the ambassador, who was really hilarious and the myths the Africans believed. It is all good light hearted humour."
4,A Good man in Africa DVD,This film is surprisingly true to the book - although it is synopsis rather than a complete dramatisation.Sean Connery is very well cast as the doctor - the other main characters are more glamorous than in William Boyd's book.As the screen play is by William Boyd this is probably why it does work well as a film.
5,loaded,"brotha lynch hung is tha siccmade brainchild that brought tha world x-raided(probably the craziest rapper ever)if x wouldn't have murdered then rapped about it and been convicted on a 30 year sentence or so...brotha lynch might have just stayed a producer but im glad he didnt cuz he came w/some of the tightest flows n'beatz for back in tha day-this album iz dope all the way thru not as hard as his first 2 albumz...but ""loaded"" definetly deliverz...feat.E-40,ICE-T,KOKANE,FIRST DEGREE & more"
5,LYNCH,BLH hit u hard on this CD if you got some 12s in your trunk then take this CD for a spin. Every song is tight Ive had this CD for five years and it still finds itself in my CD player almost every day. If you listen to LYNCH then you know good rap is. LYNCH crushes Weak S%@t like Eminem. 5/5
3,Good but not stackin up to his first 2,"It has some definate joints like did it and did it,that's what I said,and one mo pound to smoke.I think Lynch was trying to experiment a little bit and it came out tight its just not the classic Lynch..."
5,classic,all i have to say is tru classic if ur not an 80s baby that really grew up in the 90s then u dont know lynch and like my nicca said (if u dont know lynch then u dont know yo way from a hole in the ground) 25 and under has no real music they listen to cause its all the same nowadayz.....pussy-malt liquor-and weed....that black film right up under ur nose got yall stuc on the same bullshit support real gangsta rap
5,Classic Lynch,"I've had this album for prolly since it came out but I just started back on listening threw all of his albums picking out the best Brotha Lynch styles he's had throughout his career & this album proves that this is the type of Lynch that made him the most unique, awkward , most gangster lyricist out there. Still to this day Brotha Lynch has probably got the most unique form of gangster rap. He's still rappin bout razor blading peoples up."
4,Very Pleased.,"It was as stated, arrived in good time and in good condition. Thank you. I was able to convert the music and have put it to use:o)"
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Superman : Peace on Earth is a bigarse sized character spotlight by Alex Ross, basically. Also, it is Superman looking at the everyday basic problems that people on the planet face, as opposed to chasing Lex Luthor around. What to do about people that are hungry, and that sort of thing. So, lots of people will find this tame."
5,Alex Ross does it again,"The paintings of Superman flying food to the hungry are spectacular. Superman really comes to life in this edition. Paul Dini writes a great tale to accompany Ross's spectacular painitings. To watch Superman discover the limits on his power, and trying his best to make sure everyone can receive some benefit from his powers. This book really captures your attention and leads you to a greater understanding of Superman and who he is and why he does what he does. This story is highly recomended to any fan new and old."
3,Eh,"It wasn't horrible, but I couldn't recommend this book to anyone but collectors (thats obviously who it was made for anyways). These books (this one as well as the Shazam and Batman takes by the Dini/Ross collaboration) aren't well written, and I don't think anyone cared when they were making these books. They're just an excuse for Ross to paint. I'd heard these books described as illustrated novellas, but that is hardly the case. I think if I typed up the text of one of these books it'd take up MAYBE 1 1/2 - 2 pages. I found that these books read like those large over sized picture books we're bought as kids to teach us about the animals at the zoo and things in that vein. These books were made to make money, the only reason to buy them is if you're a collector. Otherwise I'd go for the more story oriented Ross works (Kingdom Come, Earth X, The Marvels), and if it's just the art you want go to his web site, but there's no reason to waste your money here."
5,One word; WHOA!,"First, a disclaimer; Superman; Peace On Earth is an illustrated novella not a comic book. A true Graphic novel, and what a tale. What that bad movie Superman IV failed to do, to show Superman fighting a real-world problem, this book succeeds in showing. Paul Dini's story could have drifted into melodrama, but he keeps the story tight, and shows the point of view of the Big Red 'S' in human terms. And who would have thought that Alex Ross would surpass his work on Kingdom Come? He knows just when to make Superman SUPER and when to make him a MAN.This story puts the ""Man"" in ""SuperMAN"", shows him to be as fallible as he is noble. Messrs. Dini and Ross, take a bow. You deserve it!"
2,Great book - bad binding!,"I have to admit that the artwork is breathtaking, the only problem with this baby is the binding! This book is so large, I think DC overlooked the binding problem - when I open the comic and try to spread the pages, the page near the gutter gets wrinkled. I tried to find a copy that doesn't have this problem, but I can't find any decent copy. I hope DC solves this problem in their next oversized formats."
2,"GREAT ART, VIRTUALLY NO STORY","The two stars this book gets is very generously given. If I was buying a pin-up book, I'd give it the full five stars, but this is supposed to be a story! Alex Ross's painting a beautiful, giving Superman and old-fashioned, noble look and also depicting the world's problems very well. But there is no story to speak of here! Superman does go through some internal and external struggles, but what was told in some 64-odd pages could have been told in 20! It just goes on and on about the same issues and frankly bores. Yes, we know the world is messed up. We know that human beings are flawed, etc, etc. Tell us something new and stop being so preachy! I am planning to get the Batman, Wonder Woman and Captain Marvel parts of this series and I'm crossing my fingers hoping that it gets better than this!"
4,ART Pro Channel Tube Mic Preamp and Compressor with EQ,Truly a great experience to use this equipment! The instructions were well organized and clear. The equipment satisfies all my expectations!
5,Rich and creamy dark chocolate fudge... delicious!,"Rich, decadent dark chocolate fudge that just melts in your mouth. Perfect for any dark chocolate lover... order yours today!"
4,From an engineering graduate student's viewpoint,Dr. Zhou's book came highly recommended to me by one of my professors -- now I know why. This is an excellent 'background' book as well as an essential reference!
4,Darkly Enchanting,"As a goth who lives in a city with no other goth friends, I thankfully have my books, music and movies to keep me sane. This book is one of them.I am glad for Ms. Kilpatrick in that she created a book in which goths and non-goths could appreciate it, especially in this day and age in which this country tolerates goth people but does not fully accept the lifestyle. In fact, I have noticed more and more books that have been published lately concerning the goth subculture, forcing people to look at us and realize that, although we do dress in black and may not follow the path of normal, we still are people who feel, think, love and hate and laugh sometimes.The book was researched well and I thoroughly enjoyed the fact that some of the people she interviewed were over the age of 25, especially since I am 30 myself.Overall, a very good book and a very good attempt at explaining our way of life."
3,"It's not bad, but the title is somewhat misleading.","With a title like ""The Goth Bible"", I had expected something like a Gothic guidepost, with some good bands to listen to and see if you like, how to make your crappy poetry rhyme and suck a little less, some makeup advice, maybe a section on how to make clothing- which is a long way of saying, a good book any Goth would do well to read and maybe get some pointers from, and if nothing else, find enjoyable. Instead, after reading the whole thing, I couldn't tell you exactly what it's about. There's a lot of information, but it's disjointed, interspersed with odds pieces of select people's opinions, and doesn't seem to go anywhere. But there is a lot of information in here, so you may like it anyway. I wouldn't call it bad, but it's not at all what I was hoping for."
3,Couldve been better,Ok..I ran out out and bought this book as soon as I heard about it. I love Nancy's fiction books and thought this would be a great Gothic compdeum(sp) of the Gothic History and subculture has has gone on despite the norms stating its a fad.Alas it was not to be. I wanted interviews from those in the scene..babygoths to eldergoths but what I got was a brief history and a lot of websites I couldve googled for.I think Nancy had the right idea but I feel the book could have been fleshed out more.
4,A Great Coffee Table Book,this book is ok to skim thru and look up stuff........ i first sat down and read the whole thing....... then after that i kept looking up the web sites for certain things...... its more useful that way...... But if your into this sorta thing get it..... Im happy i did......
5,Well Im reasonable...,I haven't read the book and no im not about to go and call all of you posers. The other reviewer that said if you shop at hottopic your a poser is wrong. Its just clothes. A poser is defined as some one who is pretending to be something their not...if you feel you are true to your self then you are and thats all that matters. Reading a book like this is informational and should not be the the guide to make your self Goth. If your goth then your goth...you shouldnt use a book to be goth...that WILL make you a poser. Its always fun to learn about new things and to see someone elses point of view on things so I say go read it.
4,Birthday Gift,"Bought this for my husband as a birthday gift.He watches every show.He really liked the dvd set,plus came with the wedding show.chose amazon to buy from,A&Es'shipping wasnt going to be in time for my husbands birthday..Give the dvd set a 4,Give Amazon a 5 for shipping."
4,The world needs more dogs,"If you have seen Dog the BOunty Hunter, you know what to expect.... however this box set also INCLUDES Dog the Bounter Hunter the wedding special , plus volumes 1,2,3....shame, because I ordered the wedding special as well so now have two...."
3,Curiously welcome rite-of-passage novel,"Rebelious Mennonite teen grows up in a disintegrating family in Canada. As her family is striped away bit by bit, a curious rite-of-passage occurs. The voice, language, ethos in this novel are interesting and feel authentic. I'll be reading more by this Canadian novelist."
3,Over-rated,I found this somewhat tedious. A litany of teenage angst. I wanted her to get on with her life. I expected much more from a prize winner.
3,Dark Humor,"Nomi Nickel feels trapped in her small, Mennonite Manitoba town. East Village, Manitoba, combines strict religiosity with all of the career opportunities inherent in a chicken-rendering plant, and has brought nothing but strife to Nomi and her family. At the book's start Nomi's mother and sister have already run off, escaping the strictures of East Village. Nomi spends much of her time dreaming about reuniting with her mother and sister, reminiscing about the past, and trying to escape the strictures of East Village. Toewes does a brilliant job of narrating as Nomi, a troubled teenager. Much of Nomi's resistence seems to come from her perverse sense of humor, which sometimes distracts the reader from just how tragic her situation is. Nomi's is a world with few opportunities and no real solutions, and the novel is certainly a cautionary statement on the dangers of ideology without thought."
2,Huh?,"The style of this novel is different and caught my attention intially. It contains some poignant, sad, humorous and beautifully written passages. But as a narrative, it leaves a lot to be desired. It's all over the place with little or no insight into characters' motives and behavior and therefore is pretty disappointing, especially after starting out so promising. Still, I give it 2 stars for cleverness of style and uniqueness."
2,Shiftless,"I was really hopeful about this book, because I didn't know anything really about Mennonites or Manitoba and I was interested in both. But it was disappointing. Maybe it's reflective of the nature of the place, but these people are just kind of wandering around, and I really lost interest in them in a hurry. I did make it all the way through...I had taken it on vacation with me and was determined to read it to the end. But it left me with a real sense of dullness.Also, what is up with the annoying trend of not using quotation marks? Maybe it makes a statement in some avant-garde writing sense, but to me it just seems sloppy."
2,I read this before,"On the plus side this book shows how devastating a fundamentalist mentality can be. As a philosopher I have argued in print that fundmentalism is the greatest of all moral evils.The main character is trapped, which creates the angst, but, while I was able to sympathize with her situation, Toews did not get me to care for her.The father is a much more interesting character. Why he stays is the real mystery.On the negative side I found the writing style to be formal and distancing. It was like reading an essay, not a novel.There are all the traditional Canadian prairie themes in this book: The outsider, the clash of cultures, the landscape, the yearning to be elsewhere.As I read this book, I kept thinking, Margaret Laurence, where are you now that we need you."
2,"Great premise, great writing style, disappointing narrative arc","The premise of this book really excited me -- I know very little about Mennonite culture and was curious to see how the format of a teen novel would frame it. Toews' writing style was perfect for the character -- very believable and natural. Unfortunately, the story itself simply didn't move enough to keep me engaged. While I applaud Toews' resistance to go for easy answers, the lack of revelation or insight into made it tough for me to get engaged in the story arc. I was disappointed by the book."
2,I didn't finish it..,I have to admit it.. I didn't finish the book. Perhaps if I had I would have been let in on a secret about why it won an award. For me a book has to propel me forward to read it with SOME sort of plot. I was waiting the entire time for something to *happen* to the main character other than just eluding to the things happening around her and how it all sucked. I'm not much for teen angst .
4,GORGEOUS shoes but a KILLER on the feet,"I LOVE LOUBOUTIN! These shoes have a beautiful silhouette and are absolutely gorgeous. They define my legs. The Pigalle feels stiff at first so I suggest that you wear them around the house for a couple of days before hitting the city. They have a high 4 inch heel so you have to get used to walking in them gracefully. These shoes are definitely not made for walking or standing for long periods of time, let alone dancing. They can be a killer on your feet. I wore them to show properties and could not stand it. Now I carry an extra pair of flip flops in my car for relief. :o)"
5,Gypsy Colt,"I was horse crazy from as far back as I can remember. I saw ""Gypsy Colt"" when I was 8 years old and he became my ""dream horse"". I am now 56 and I still love the movie and that horse. I would recommend this movie to everyone...even those who aren't horse crazy would enjoy it."
3,In depth survey following historico-critical methods,"Anderson uses easy to read sentences and aims his OT introduction at the lay person, but will be useful more to students and pastors because of the content. I was somewhat disappointed that he has nothing on Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement). R.K. Harrison's Intro to the OT is much more comprehensive, including discussion using both historico-critical methodology and conservative approaches, whereas Anderson assumes that the historico-critical method is the only way to go. Nevertheless, the information is readily accessible and easy to read, and illustrated well."
3,Abridged version not so good,"I was not able to find a copy of the original full edition (which is what I really wanted), so I settled for the abridged version. It's ok but much of the really good stuff is not included and references to the work in other books do not work as the pagination is way off. I guess I am just too much of a purist."
3,OT Understanding,"It is just a OT history book. It is no better or worse than all the thousands written before it. However, the cost of the book would give you the impression that it should be worth it's weight in gold. I purchased twelve book for summer seminary courses and this book cost more than the other eleven combined. I purchased it because I had to have it. I would not purchase this book just to have something to read. You certantly can get your money's worth elsewhere. I would be happy to sell this book to another student at a much lower price than to sell it back to the seller to charge this extravagant amount. I have taken about thirty ministry courses over the last few years and I have never had to pay $61.00 for even a new book. This makes me appreciate the schools and bookstores that make every effort to keep prices low on religious literature."
4,Daphne's Book,I enjoyed Daphne's Book alot. I liked the way the author made the story mix well with the characters. I also liked how she describes certain moments in the chapter. One of my favorite parts of the book was when one of the characters Daphne revieled two of her deepest secrets to one of her new friends. Daphne shared something so big with Jessica that Jessica stood by Daphne throughout the whole book. I recomend this book to anyone that wants a good book to read.
4,A True Book of Friendship,"Daphne's Book was a very good book. It proved that even though people aren't popular you can still be friends with them. It tested friendhip over every limit. Jessica truely proved she was a great friend. This book starts out slow and boring, but believe me it ws worth reading. It tought me not to bully people and made me realize my life's not so bad after all. Mary Downing Hahn wrote this book in such detail I thought it was happening in real life. I recomend this book to anyone who likes a book of true friendship and drama."
5,Read it,I am ten years old and I read DAPHNE'S BOOK. It is about a girl named Daphne. Daphne is poor and lives with her grandmother. The way she gets her money is by picking up cans by the road. Daphne gets picked on by almost all the kids in school. They call her Daffy Duck. Daphne's grandmother goes crazy and she has to live with relatives of her moms in Maine.I recomend this book to kids 8 & up.
4,"A really good, really sweet book","""Social issues,"" of any kind, are usually the death knell of the children's book, but, although they seem to be creeping in here, they are handled expertly and do not intrude upon the narrative._Daphne's Book_ is very reminiscent of Zilpha Keatley Snyder in her non-occult mode, so if you like that, you'll probably like this, too. But then, I always like books that have kids half-embarassedly playing games they know they're too old for.I can't believe I called a book ""really sweet,"" but I'm going to pretend it never happened and quickly post this before I can change it. I mean, after all, it's true."
4,A True Book of Friendship,"Daphne's Book was a very good book. It proved that even though people aren't popular you can still be friends with them. It tested friendship over every limit. Jessica truely proved she was a great friend. This book starts out slow and boring, but believe me it ws worth reading. It tought me not to bully people and made me realize my life's not so bad after all. Mary Downing Hahn wrote this book in such detail I thought it was happening in real life. I recomend this book to anyone who likes a book of true friendship and drama."
5,Wow! This is a must read!!!!,"Daphne's Book is a wonderful story dealing with friendship. When Jessica, an average accepted student, is paired with Daphne, a social outcast, for a project, she is less than thrilled. However as the two girls work on the project they build a strong, lasting friendship. Jessica soon finds out about a secret that Daphne is having to live through that could be hurting her. Jessica tries to help the best she can without spilling the secret. When the secret is told, Daphne gets upset and the two get into an argument. Will their friendship last despite this? Read this book to find out! I thoroughly enjoyed this book and recommend it to anyone. It is a wonderful tale that makes me wish for as lasting a friendship as they had. This is definately a story you should add to your reading list!"
2,"This Book Was Depressing, Yet Full of Many Strong Emtions","Daphne's Book is a depressing book in a way, yet it is full of emtion. It is sad to think that people such as the character Daphne have to live in horrid conditions. It is also depressing to think and to actually know that people will make fun of people that they have no idea about! Jessica was a brave character who risked a reputaion for a hearts sake. This book teaches us that different people, aren't all that different. The way the author presented the bookm ade it come out with strong feeling and emtion!"
2,beats were nice,"i found the beats on this disc to be the usual nicely produced product of ant banks', but most of the lyrics weren't anything substantial. my favorite cuts were big thangs, cant stop and 4 tha hustlas. check these out, dub 'em to a tape and throw away the rest of the cd. peace."
2,Ant Banks,Ok car rolla's this ones for you! This album has a nice gathering of people from 2pac to Ice Cube. Yet sorry I picked it up to play for a club and on this note this album offered nothing. I see all the thug wanna be's running in to get this yet the majority will never pick this one up.
4,One of Clue's ultimate best.,"This book was a well written well paced book that I read after all the other first twelve. The reaon I did that is because I could not find it. I have always read Clue books for there light hearted fun. This was very funny, but also very hard to solve the mysteries. END"
3,Easy-to-read music from the musical,"This book includes the songs Aldonza, Dulcinea, The Impossible Dream, I Really Like Him, Knight of the Woeful Countenance, Little Bird,Little Bird, A Little Gossip, and Man of La Mancha. Includes lyrics and chord markings in addition to piano score. I believe some of the songs have been truncated for the purposes of the book."
2,Falling Apart,"The book and Cohen's writing and pictures are classic Leonard Cohen--wry, thought-provoking and sometimes whimsical. I love that. However, the book binding fell apart the first week I had it. The pages came out in clumps from the cover, making it very difficult to read. I keep it together with a big binder clip and have to manage several clumps of pages to read it...a hassle at best. Bad construction. Amazon gave me a 50% discount, but I couldn't even find a contact person for ECCO Books to let them know about it."
5,Looking forward to reading ths,i have only recently become a Leonard Cohen fan (of his music). Now i'm looking forward to reading his literature. Good delivery.
5,Nothing short of brilliant.,"I love this book, I sent it to a friend and she loved it too. Much of it is peppered with little Zen-like Buddhist concepts, if you're into eastern schools of thought, you will get a lot out of this book. Nothing like a lovesick Buddhist, right?"
3,"As a Poet,He's a Great Song Writer.","If you're a Leonard Cohen fan(which I kind of am,which is why I bought this book)then you'll probably like it a lot more than me,but all I kept longing for was another book to read.There are some good poems,but there is a lot of repetitive themes and mediocre poems as well.At least it's given me confidence that even I could write poems just as good,if not better.Thanks Leonard,but I'll stick to Bukowski for my poetry."
2,"Died on me, discontinued","The card was great for a while (got it as a replacement for a very buggy Netgear FA-311), but after about 4 months it died - it would start dropping packets after initially establishing a connection, and finally it could only send packets to my router about 25% of the time.I checked the 3com site and apparently this model has been discontinued. Oh, well."
4,great book,"It is a really good book, a book that have to have if already working with your angels, it gives a bust to lift a creative ideas to work with your angels. I t gives also new ideas that you can create on your own,its better than I thoight to be, I recomend this book if you want to work creatives with your angels."
4,SHE IS THE BOMB,I LIKE MIA-X CAUSE SHE IS THE BOMB.SHE IS THE HYPEST LADY RAPER I'VE EVER HEARD.MIA-X BE SNAPPIMG! YOU GO GIRL
2,Parataxical Deficit,"Certain notions of exegetical proficiency almost require a--shall we say?--delicatesse, or at least finesse. The last time we were treated to so fecund a remonstrance was when pimp lord Slicey Dice had his J put in the cut, and that aint no f*ckin' joke, Sugarfly! Look what it got him, too: A straight chute to the slapmaster with no posing allowed. Shyeet! That would just about make it for me, let alone someone so levied as to even attempt a collateral estoppel.Anyway, it was cuzza this that Miriam Schoonover took the name Mia X and started doing that thing. You know. Now she raps on it and we all gotta take something back if we wanna keep clear about it. You know."
5,FINALLY! A CLASSIC IS BACK.,"ONE OF THE HOTTEST FEMALE OR MALE RAPPERS EVER. I would have loved to have heard more of her over the last 10 years or so. Mia has popped up on a few guest spots(Gucci, couple of mix tapes) and proves she still got skills. After scratchin and losin this CD, I'm thrilled its finally out digitally. I always catch myself goin back to Mia X and MAC every so often. Lyrics were so visual and not bubblegum like allot of today rap. Mia come back...WE ARE WAITING!!!!!"
5,A very informative guide,"This book was very informative and well written with a multitude of graphs, analysis breakdowns, and general information that even a beginner can easily understand. I highly recommend it."
4,Muy buen manual,El libro esta frnacamente genial. Un buen manual de cultivos auxilares para cualquier acuarista aficionado o profesional. Recomendable 100 %
2,Looks can be deceiving (on the internet),"I know now why this vanilla sugar was so much less money then most, the vanilla beans are not ground. There are two, whole beans in the container and if you want them ground, guess who does it? You will need a very fine spice grater, luckily I had one. I will probably need to buy even more beans because I like the vanilla flavor intense! I was quite dissapointed. :("
1,Does not taste like vanilla,I ordered this product maybe 2 weeks ago and I just opened it. I do not taste or smell vanilla. I wouldn't recommend this product.
3,Mediocre.,"I loved Texasville, and couldn't finish Terms of Endearment. Unfortunately, ""Some Can Whistle"" is closer to Terms of Endearment, although I can take the main character, Danny Deck, more seriously. He is the former writer/producer of a number one rated TV series, who has become depressed, and doesn't do much on an isolated estate. The 21 year old daughter he has never seen contacts him, and sets the plot in motion, while awakening him from his depression. In some ways she is his antithesis: vital, joyful, impulsive. The book revels in eccentricities, but I didn't find it very amusing. It does make some interesting explorations of the nature of love and friendship between man and woman (parental love for children is unconditional in the novel). I found the main character interesting at times, and enjoyed the daughter. The book's ending was moving."
5,Mc Murtry's haunting story,"It is easy to see in reviewing the reviews, that people either love or hate this book. It is a short book which treats itself as unimportant until it reminds us to live life. It is like ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" in that it teaches us that the essence of your life can be defined by a very short period of time. This can be a very moving book."
4,Consider the turns life takes,"I love this book. Danny Deck's journey from a self-involved recluse to the walking wounded is both funny and tragic. Just as in real life, Danny's life changes forever in the course of a phone call. T. R. and the cast of characters that draw Danny back into the land of the living for an all too brief time are unforgetable. I sometimes find myself thinking of this story, partly because something similar happened to me. But I also think of this story when I realize yet again that life short and can turn on a dime. Danny's story is universal, although few of us a gazillioniares. Love, loss and the journey not taken is something everyone, in one way or another, can relate to. This book will make you think."
3,Whatever Happened to Danny Deck?,"Ever since I read ""All My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers,"" I wondered what became of Danny Deck. Come to find out that Deck is alive, though not particularly well. He has isolated and insulated himself. Then, after being lost to him for twenty years, his daughter appears and overturns his life. She pierces his armor and brings him joy and tears. There are moving and beautiful moments in this book, and some hilarious ones as well."
2,The only book that I could put down of Mr Mcmurtry's,This book I found the characters leaving a bad taste in my mouth. There is only one scene I found endering. I found All My Friends... enjoyable. But not this one. Mr McMurtry I love the rest of your woorks.
2,A Cheat,"McMurtry never backs away from being a brutal narrator when he has to be -- death stalks many of his books from Horseman Pass By to Lonesome Dove, Streets of Laredo and Duane's Depressed, and death can come suddenly and shockingly, without respect for what readers have come to expect are ""the rules"" of storytelling. That being said, this is the one McMurtry book where the shock feels like a cheap device, instead of like pitiless but honest storytelling. Some Can Whistle meanders about, with Danny Deck trying to find common ground with his hell-on-wheels daughter, and then the book's big surprise comes, and then it's over. But that's about it -- the book just ends, and unlike, say, Streets of Laredo, you haven't learned anything. You've just been surprised, and that's not enough."
2,A gift for words with a preposterous plot.,"Although this is the first of McMurtry's books I have read, his name is familiar through films made from his books. His gift for verbal illustration is quite enjoyable and his descriptions are vivd. The problem with the book is that not one of the characters is likeable except for T.R.'s children and even that is questionable. I was actually happy when they were murdered by T.R.'s ex-lover. After her death and that of Godwin, the book spirals downward in a series of narratives of promising lives cut short as one after another of the characters dies. The narrator, Danny Deck, comes off as a spoiled and spoiling multi-millionaire without any sense of discipline for himself or the others. The entire narrative comes off as pointless and after finishing the book my feeling was one of time wasted."
4,Different Workout,"I own all of Ms. Contello's DVD's and I think that her workouts are very ""mindful"" and inspirational. The workouts are broken down into 3 workouts on each DVD. Each one is similar to one another, but a little more challenging @ each interval. I REALLY like her music that she chooses and she is very personable in her instructions, which are easy to follow. I would recommend this (and other) DVD's to anyone. It is a really neat twist of yoga/dance/whatever. It brings a spice to any workout collection and also opens your mind a little wider to the way you percieve things in life."
1,Save your money,"Seriously, this dvd is so-o-o short, and quite disappointing. I don't know why it is called Yoga Dance because there is no reference to any yoga posture or explanation of correct ways to hold the body to receive full advantage from the workout. I'm sure this teacher is a very sweet person who has wonderful classes, but this does not transfer well to a DVD program. I have had a lot more success with teachers like Shiva Rea who give real instructions as they teach."
2,NOTHING to do with yoga!,"If I were 50 and looking for a gentle dance routine themed in different elements, this would be a good DVD for me. I have done a couple of the dances from the Water DVD and one from the Earth DVD and there is nothing relating to yoga in the two. I bought the Fire one also and I'm sure I'll run into the same thing. I have practicing yoga for 3 years and do it every day. I was looking for a supplemental practice that incorporated dance which is why I bought these. I have NO IDEA why they are titled Yoga Dance. So far I have danced to drums and done some salsa and hula Polynesian moves. Nothing wrong with the dance for what it is but I'm very disappointed it is completely misrepresented as yoga combined with dance."
3,The album has its moments as well as downfalls,"Mr.Serv-On's first album is okay. If you are used to No Limit's regergitated gangsta-gangsta, I'm the hardest type of raps, then this is for you. Some songs are down right offensive and degrading towards certain people. I'll just say: It's alright."
4,life insurance,"Well, serv has changed since the days of ""Life Insurance."" It seems like he cares more about his life now. On his first album I felt like he was just getting something off his chest. The album has great songs like, We ant the same, Who raised me, Head and shoulders,Best friend,and the soldier song.Even tho he has changed, he still has some of his old ways on his newer albums."
1,bought it didnt like it,overall didnt like it when it came out and really didnt play more than 5 times
4,Great Album for S-E-R-V,"On his debut album, Mr. Serv-On shows that he has skill and diversity, plus he can gel and team with his labelmates, a must for any No Limit artist. The best songs were prolly ""Hustlin'"" and ""Cemetary Made"", and the song ""Affiliiated"", which he did by himself. The beats were knockin' and Serv was puttin' it down tight. Must buy for anyone."
3,not too good,"NO LIMIT have released dozens of cds - check out other soldiers such as MAC, SOULJA SLIM, C- MURDER, MIA X, KANE AND ABEL ETC,I do not think servon was that good - HE HAS DONE SOME GOOD STUFF ON OTHER NO LIMIT CDS THOUGH!!"
1,Ink Cartridge not satisfactory,"Cartridge did not work properly; did not wind properly, cartridge carbon paper stuck to copy paper. Have returned it expecting credit."
4,works well,The ink cartridge for the IntelliFax machine that I have gives good prints (both faxes and copies). Would recommend.
2,bought it...not accurate,"This meter claims a accuracy of .05% , it was off by more than 1%. Factor of 20!!There is no posted info on how to contact the manufacturer.If you are working on a lawn mower engine it will be OK.If you are trying to determine exact RPM....not so good.Fair at best for non-scientific use."
4,A good tach.,"Very good and accurate. The only drawback I can find, is that you have to keep a switch depressed while you are using it. Other than that, it is very good product, it comes with all you need to make it work.I use it to tune my '77 Corvette."
4,Neiko Digital Laser Tachometer,"Found this tachometer accurate and easy to use, was without batteries even though power adaptor was included, which is very oddIt is supposed to have rechargeable batteries, which was not included???"
4,good but cheaper ones are just as good,"This works well, however, if you look elsewhere here or on other web sites, you will find what are exactly the same product with different brand names and sellers but up to one-half the price! I tried one of those, and they are identical in function as they are in appearance. I suggest you look around and find the cheaper brands, though make sure you consider who is selling them and what after-purchase service you may receive."
5,Neiko Professional Digital Laser Photo Non-Contact Tachometer,"Just had to get this lean running lawn tractor back in the rotation.Paid a little more for fast shipping and it was worth it.This tach had my adjustment issues solved in under 2 minutes!After doing a tune-up I found my best guess at idle speed was off by 20% from the manual and now the engine runs like a top.Should work as well on the weed wacker, snow blower, and boat motors etc.Great price, fast delivery, good results, nice storage case, easy to use."
5,rpm checker,Item arrived as expected. Overall nice appearance and quality. Performed as expected and I would purchase this item again if I needed another one.
5,Great tool,"Simple and easy to use, takes cheap batteries and performs well. Has worked flawlessly over the last two years since I bought it here on sale, was definitely a good value and I would recommend it to others."
1,Longevity,"Used it twice and always stored in the shipping case. Third time it emits laser but won't count revs. No warranty that I can find and no address for mfgr. on product, packaging or paperwork. Pretty expensive for a two time use item."
4,"+Cheap, Easy -Lacks refinement, features","This is truly a product that fits its price range. Its cheap, and does not come with any frills or features. But, it works, and is very easy to set up. For the price, its a great buy.EXCEPT one thing. For our testing I found it annoying there was no setting to take a measurement, just a button that had to continuously be pressed for it to read RPMs. We ended up taping the button down, which worked well enough. Of course, I should have known this before I bought it.Good product for what you pay"
4,Tach,"As advertised, works good ,ok just fine,plenty good, it's ok mon, fine with me, shipping ok, pakage ok, there.wow,sufficient,will do."
1,TRASH!! STAY AWAY!!,"Well, I'm a clear minded brazillian, and I will tell you what is rock today in this land full of overrated insipid and untalented ""artists"" that only looks for easy money than something really big, memmorable.Here are the list of real rock bands in Brazil (not including the heavy metal ones, only the pure rock):-Casa Das Máquinas;-Made In Brazil;-Mutantes;-Cazuza;-Lenine;-Bando Do Velho Jack;-Dr. Sin;-Baro Vermelho;-Ira;-Nenhum de Nós;-Roupa Nova;-Lobo;-Taffo;-Golpe de Estado;-Virgo;-Tritone;-Frank Solari;-Patrulha do Espao;-Ultraje a Rigor.Well, enough said, avoid that Capital Inicial that is nothing but bubblegum pop for teens and get something from these bands that I told you about."
4,Best Charlie Brown Jr. record ever,Great album and a great live acustic performance from one of the most important brazilian band.money worth.
2,Eh,"I was so hoping these would work. Had a severe spider problem - maybe they're just not meant for spiders? I thought the product was working for awhile, and maybe it was, perhaps the spiders got used to the sound/immune to it. Save yourself - just go to Home Depot & get the spider/insect killer w/the battery-operated handle sprayer. Worked like a dream."
1,Doesn't work for roaches,"It doesn't work! Roaches are roaming around as they were before, even sitting on the device! It was a waste of my money. Can't bother to pack and send it back for a refund."
2,I still have bats on the seeling,This product make the bats less anoying but still I can hear them often. Probably the product was not designed for flying pest.
1,What a waste of money,"I bought this pack to deter the mouse/moles living in my mother's basement when I moved in with her and was sleeping down there on a floor mat. I'm not afraid of mice, but don't want the little critters crawling all over me while I sleep... Her basement is soooo clean and neat and the carpet is new, but the mice/moles still come around for some visits...Anyway, these were useless.. I can't tell you how many nights I wake up feeling something zip across my body!! Even my 2 cats aren't enough to scare these critters away... I used peppermint oil before at my old place and that worked better than these... I don't recommend purchasing this product at all, unless you're okay with wasting money and having critters living with you...In that case, buy cages and wheels for them to enjoy their stay."
3,Working so far,"I have been having a spider and ant problem in our home for the past couple of weeks and decided to buy this item. I was a little skeptical at first, but they seem to be working. No signs of spiders or ants ever since I plugged them in. The only not so good thing about this product is that they make a click sound, kind of like the hand on a clock does every second. But, instead of every second it happens every 3-4 seconds. During the day I do not notice it because of all the noise coming from the kids, dishwasher, washer/dryer, etc... At night when the kids are in bed and the house is quiet is when I can hear the clicks. Some might be bothered by this, but it doesn't bother me at all. I am just happy that I haven't seen an ant and especially a spider in my house!"
1,These are so annoying,So we had a mouse problem and I figured they wouldn't work for mice and they did not. I left them in for about 2 months and did not notice any difference in bugs either. We get spiders in the spring and there was a spider sitting right next to the thing. They also make a really annoying popping/clicking sound that drove our dogs crazy. I would look for something else. If you need help with getting rid of mice try Victor M252 Electronic Mouse Trap. This took care of our problem. Caught 10 mice in a week and haven't seen any since.
3,I can hear it...,"Let me start off by saying I am not now nor have I ever been a mouse, but I CAN HEAR THESE THINGS!!!OK, I'm probably not hearing the piercing, annoying sounds our furry friends are getting but they make an audible click in random patterns. It sounds exactly like water dripping. We live in a small house so I can hear ALL THREE of them going at once.Other than that... I can't say yet whether they work or not. My cat seems unbothered, that's good. Time will tell whether the mice find this new arrangement objectionable.Hey, some people enjoy atonal opera, speed metal or Celine Dion. Who knows, these particular mice may decide to invite their friends over to hang out and listen or maybe they'll start checking out craigslist for some new digs. Time will tell..."
1,did not work so well,These items really did not work as well as they said they would the did not work on cockroahes or mice
1,Faulty product - Dont waste your money!!!!!!!,I found droppings in my apt that I was hoping this product would help with. I installed two in my very small kitchen only to find droppings over the next couple of days. Please don't waste your money on this. Its not worth it! In regards to the other reviews of the mice/pests dissapearing - just plain luck I guess because this was clearly not effective in my apt.
4,economical and good deterrent,this product is reasonable in price but is a good deterrent against bugs inside the house.
2,Work for three weeks.....,"I haven't seen any mice or any mouse's droppings for three weeks. I plugged in two of these ultrasonic, but doesn't work after three weeks. I just saw another mice running in my kitchen two days ago!!! I think mouse sticky pads or mouse trap may work better than this."
2,We still have ants and centipedes,"We still have pesky ants that walk right by the device and those creepy house centipedes. The click is annoying for about a week and then it is easily ignored. It doesn't bother my cat though, so that is good. I left it up anyway, just in case. It's been up for three years now. Still have the ant, so I conclude it does not work."
2,I am not sure about the effectiveness of this item,I purchased 2 sets (total of 6). I am not sure about the effectiveness of this item. I still got some bug-bites after plugging them in the electrical outlets.
1,The Best Man's Organiser,"Not very useful for Americans. This book was written by and for the British. The Chapter on what to wear discusses ""morning dress"" ""lounge suit"" ""buying a suit"" and ""hiring a suit."" Huh?Wisdom on getting to the church: ""If you are taking your own car, check beforehand that it has been serviced and is in good working order. Check the oil and water, give it a thorough clean inside and out and fill up with petrol the day before."" Thanks for the advice! Can I get a refund?Filling the car with petro (before the wedding) is the highlight of the book."
2,Not great yet,"I don't know how MP became a star with CD's like this. The only good songs were the two bonus tracks, ""Robbery"" and ""Always Look A Man In The Eyes"", both of which were recorded in 1997. Obviously a West Coast influenced album (which is not a bad thing, I'm just making that clear), it shows where came from."
2,DESCENT ALBUM FOR STARTING OFF,"This album is smoking if you like WEST COAST music. I'm not saying I don't like it, but DOWN SOUTH music is my preference. His first two albums were mostly WEST COAST, his other album being his second one 99 WAYS TO DIE was a little better. On his third album ICE CREAM MAN, it was a mixture of WEST COAST AND DOWN SOUTH. On his last two albums GHETO DOPE AND MP DA LAST DON, they are all DOWN SOUTH, which are both his best two albums. I just did not really care for this album because MASTER P's voice did not sound mature enough, but it is the only album that I can recall that did not have his slogan, ""UHHH,"" when he raps through his songs, which is truly surprising."
4,Not as good as the 1994 release...,"The 1997 release as only one +: 2 bonus songs.Now I explain the -:_Left out a track_Censored the cover (the poster is censored and it's nothing but the b*tch is censored too and it's bad...)_Change the color of the cover.I know the ""collector edition"" is cheaper than the original but she is not as good as the original.Buy it if you haven't the original version, but if you have the original version, don't buy it."
4,The Begining of the greatest record label,"This is the real shingle. It was started in Richmond, Ca. Everyone who knows of MP then knows that he was going to where he is at. It has more WEST coast flavor then he does now but because it is a WEST coast album. The first cut ""The Ghetto Tryin' To Kill Me"" is the album starter that lets you know. So to listen to where it all started buy this old school juice."
3,Maybe better in German,Great film but much is lost in translation....if youknow German. I had to reorder film from another sellerto get subtitled German version.
3,Translation is not the best!,"I'm someone from Germany living in US right now and I've seen this movie ca. 2 years ago in Germany - it wasn't bad. After I bought it here with the english subtitle, I must say that it's much funnier and better to watch it if you're able to understand the people talking. It's alright with the subtitle, but sometimes it is much too fast or you cannot see the yellow letters on a light background. Also the way of the language is kept simple and not always the right way."
4,"Good book, recommended for everyone with a science background entering physiology/biology","I wish I had this book when I started in this field. It is so much nicer to learn from such a well written and comprehensive textbook than to try to extract all the information from journal articles. Some background in physiology and, particularly, mathematics (ODE's, algebra, etc.) is required though to make the most out of this book. (Parts of) the book are/is well suited for an advanced course in computational biology."
2,doesn't last,This fragrance is nice but does not last but a few hours. Also the cologne leaks around the cap when you spray it(it's obviously a defective cap and more than likely the reason the perfume was 1/2 the price of dept store). I would not repurchase the perfume or use the same store.
3,"It really does NOT last, LOVE the scent, but not worth the price.","When I buy an expensive perfume, I expect it to last all day if you spray some in the morning. Although I absolutely adore this scent, I do not think this perfume is worth the price. I switched from Chanel Allure, another wonderful perfume that lasts for days and days after just one spray. Perhaps this is why I am noticing such a marked difference between the two.If you buy this perfume, be prepared to carry the bottle around with you all day if you're out of your home for more than 5 hours.5 stars for the scent5 stars for the packaging2 stars for longevity of the scent.2 Stars for the price, if you consider how much and often you have to spray."
4,10 points for Amazon and Cosmetic Plaza!!!,"The fragrance is awesome,though a bit strong in the first note so you should not exagerate when you spray it,a drop is more than enough for you to feel more beautiful than you already are!Amazon estimate that it should arrive between October 8th and 23rd,but it came today!!Much sooner than I expected,and I must say that I live in Portugal,Europe which is a little far from California :DI can only say two thumbs up for Amazon and Cosmetic for the great service that they provide.I will definitively purchase online again!!"
1,Poor Re-recordings,At first you note the great collection of songs. When you get the set of 4 cds you are disappointed because they are re-recordings from TV shows or some othe copywrite absent source.
1,Oh dear...,"I have no problem with Hilary Duff when she is doing the pop things that she likes to do...if people want to buy that then go ahead. But I have a problem when someone like her takes one of the greatest youth rebellion songs and one of the best songs ever written and waters it down (""hope I DON'T die before I get old"")? For everyone who thinks that Hilary wrote that or likes her version...I would advise actually going out and listening to the original version by The Who...people with actual musical talent and real rebellious spirit."
2,Inaccurate information,"At first glance this book seems to be a great overview of sharks with lots of great pictures. However, it does give some inaccurate information. In chapter 4 they discuss shark hearing and claim that they have otoliths, when in fact they do not. Otoliths, which sense vibrations and pressure changes are only found in ostyichthes (bony fish), not elasmobranches (sharks, skates, and rays). I haven't read cover to cover, but who knows what else could be inaccurate..."
3,Encyclopedia of Sharks,The book is wonderful. The binding is the problem. The slick pages causes the binding to break. So if this is for a library you might want to consider another book.
3,word play,"The description for the condition of the book did not meet my expectations. It said there may be some writing, in fact, almost every single ""word play"" was completed! BOO! I didn't get to think for myself on this one. I think it would be a great book if anyone can find one with most of the activities still blank. There are lots of old sayings I never heard of, so it was interesting to see how words have been used in the past compared to phrases I use now."
3,Rehash of R. Lederer's other WONDERFUL books.,I was disappointed in this book after having read many of Mr. Lederer's other books. Usually his books are immensely enjoyable but this felt redundant.
3,"Good story, but lacks depth","This is a very ironic case, where a single mother who is well known in her community for her tough stance against gangs turns out to be the ringleader of one. Unfortunately, while the story itself is very interesting, the book is not written all that well. I felt it lacked depth. I think more detail and more background is called for, to give the reader the feeling of knowing the characters. There were also some confusing and/or conflicting passages. Worth reading, but not one of my favorite true crime books."
5,Doris Dorrie Rules!,"We just do not get enough chance to see Doris Dorrie's movies in the US! And of all her movies this is the one most overlooked, yet, I think, the best right up there with the more recent Enlightenment Guaranteed! Doris Dorrie has a wonderful way with relationships between two people. She endows these relationships with magic, reality and tenderness that can cheer you up no matter what has been descending on you in your real life! When the ""Skelton"" explains what the past and future are....well, it is the most important moment in film! Everyone should take his advice and live by it. A wonderful movie and the entire crew singing a Piaf song in the end...perfection!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!,Do not buy this item. The adhesive on the strip does not stick to human skin. The sterile pad is too small to cover much more than a pimple.
5,George - Re-visited,"As an old drinking buddy of George's, an advisor for his firearm references and his jacket photographer for some of his later books, please rest assured that ""..A Broken Man"" will put you on the path of his magic, a path of surprise, adventure, and heart-felt emotions. When finished with this book, please stay with the series and make certain that ""Beasts of Valhalla"" graces your eyes. It is not only the pinnacle of his efforts, but especially given the computer-generated graphics in today's field, would make the most excellent of film features. Hope that someday a producer in California can see the potential.Sadly, George is no longer with us, but with this book and the others, his voice sings on."
5,mmmm best fish I've tasted in a long time,"It was fresh, delivery was fast and the taste was mmmmmgood. I never had Omaha fish before and I am going to see if i can put this on a monthly order. This is a recommended buy"
2,"Does the job - poor documentation, poor support",Beware of a few things. First the print server is compatble with very few printers. Go to D-Link's website and make sure your printer is compatible. Also if you are running a firewall on your PC's they may not see each other. The documentation is very sparse. The unit has a firewall but no explanation as to how it functions - your just suppose to trust it! D-link support will blow you off with ANY network questions. Unless it deals directly with the box they will say they can't help you. Other than that it works - next time I'll look at Netgear.
1,Really bad product.,"Hi,The router function works as expected.Unfortunately I Paid for the printserver too.It does not work with my Epson Stylus cx4100,D-Link couldat least put a list of actual supported printers in its web site.Altough its such an old product it is still sold in Brazil."
1,Defective products from Amazon,I've ordered this router from Amazon; it came defective.Then a replacement router (same model 704up) - also defective.D-link tech support was surprised that their new routers were not functioning at all.
2,The Demos... for hardcore fans only,"These songs are off of their 1st two demo tapes, so the vocals sound quality is poor(they do sound like whispers). The Instruments don't sound too bad but there are better Vader CD's. Get Vader's later releases Black To The Blind or De Profundis. DAMN, also check out Vader's cover of Reign In Blood on their Live in Japan CD. I dare you to go out & try to find a better cover!"
2,not the best of death metal,"I liked it at first, but after I heard other death metal CD's I got tired of it. It just didn't sound right. The vocals were just whispers and you could barely hear them. I don't think I would keep this one at all."
5,Soft & Silky Hair!,"I have naturally curly hair. I have a lot of hair, but my hair is fine. I have found that this product conditions my hair really well without being too heavy and weighing my hair down. Instead my hair feels soft and silky!This product smells awesome, which is another reason why I love using it."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DEODORANT,"I bought this deodorant a few years ago and it smelled good but was not a very strong deodorant. I recently bought (4) sticks and noticed they changed the packaging and consequently changed the formula. Within about 10 seconds of applying the deodorant, my body heat made it smell awful. The scent is similar to somthing like baby vomit and it actually overpowers the Cool Water colonge. Shame on Davidoff to change the formula on something that was fine and to turn it into a horrible smelling product. DO NOT BUY THIS DEODORANT!!!!!"
3,Casual Use,I'm a blue-collar worker when sweating is most common every day. This worked best for casual non-working days. Found it offensively smelling a few hours after working. Great smell before getting to work. Within hours it smelled like I applied it 3 days ago. No I don't naturally smell bad. I'm just very conciencious how I smell. This is more of a cologne smell than a powder deodorant. So you can imagine. Most body deodorants all smell like TAG. Expensive.
3,Still good,"This is good, but it's different from what I want. It smells good. It works perfectly with my perfume. So I guess it's a good product."
1,YUCK!!,I was very excited about getting these ... The reviews seemed rather promising but as soon as I popped one in my mouth I had to keep myself from GAGGING! I couldnt even finish it! I have brushed my teeth three times and still taste it in my mouth!! yuck!! What a letdown :(
2,has everything except for taste,"As far as content, it has everything you need in a vitamin. Also, it does not upset my stomach. However, I can not manage to swallow it because the taste is horrible! I gagged several times on the flavor of the vitamin. I ended up returning the bottle because I knew I would never be able to get past the flavor.The size of one tablet is equivalent to stacking 4 quarters on top of each other. You have to chew two tablets for a normal adult dose. I couldn't do it."
1,THE WORST VITAMIN/MEDICINE I'VE EVER TASTED!,"I bought the ""Delicious Apple Cinnamon"" and I can honestly say it's the most disgusting vitamin I've ever tasted. And that's saying a lot because I'm not a picky eater. It was so bad that after a few days, I broke down and bought another brand chewable multi-vitamin from my grocery. The ""Delicious Apple Cinnamon"" is now collecting dust on my shelf. Consider yourself warned."
5,This is the best multi vitamin our family has ever taken.,This vitamin gives us better energy than we have every experienced on another vitamin. We only take one per day and we eat lots of fresh fruits and veggies in our daily diet. We can tell when we haven't taken it for a couple of days. I would recommend it.
3,Okay product but gross flavor and HIGH in sugar,"Why on earth would this need to contain so much sugar?? I should have read that before purchasing. I prefer my loads of sugar in soda and candy... The taste is almost unpalatable, we choked them down. They are HUGE..biggest ones I've ever purchased and you have to eat 2 to get the daily dose. Won't purchase again. Ugh. Gave 3 stars for nutrition value not counting the sugar downside..."
4,got what i wanted fast,The product came fast and was exactly what I wanted. Would've liked a cheaper shipping option though since I don't feel like muslin strips need to be shipped in a box.
4,"Nice product, works great",Great product and great price. Doesn't feel cheap or filmsy at all. Adhears nicely and holds up strong pull. works great.
2,Too thin,"I loved these strips the previous time I bought them, but they are now made of thinner material. After using a few times, wax starts to soak through & makes my hands sticky."
3,Hmmmm,"Ok, so it was my first time waxing, which by the way, was hell. So I'm not an expert, but it took off the hair well, except for I was really mad that the extra little strings got freaking everywhere, grr."
1,Lots of fly-out stuff,"I don't recommend this to anyone. These muslin strips produce too much fly-put particles from the fabric itself - first when you rub the strip to stick to the wax, and then when you zip it off the skin. Not only it felt unpleasant because some of these parts fly back to my skin and stick there (cause of the remaining wax) but the whole floor was covered with it. So I had the pleasure of vacuuming after epilating.I have used other muslin strips and they have too produced this flyout stuff but way way less.I was so frustrated that I didn't even finish all the epilating I'd planned initially, and threw the remaining 60-70 strips in the trash."
2,Not worth it,This product is not that great. Very very stick and not effective at hair removal. It makes a huge mess plus there was a $4.95 stick on it and I paid way over that with supposedly free shipping??!
3,I wish this book had been written before the movie,"It has all the outrageous hype instead of plot focus that you find in Bond flicks. In other words, this is a Bond story for people who don't like to read--you should be looking for it over in ""video"". This book has the first and only really explicit sex scene in a Bond novel. And the thing's done by a man who's otherwise done a decent job of carrying 007 beyond the death of Ian Fleming. I'm not surprised it's out of print. As blues veteral Jack Bruce once put it; ""What a bringdown""."
3,James Bond,James bond is at it again. James has taken it to a whole new level with goldeneye a new high tech disk that can control the satelietes that orbit the earth. An old face comes in named trevelend or 006 this decetful guy betrays her majesties secert servies to go with Janus an evil vilian that wants the goldeneye disk. Is james smart enough to out do his mentor you well have to read the book.
4,There's Gold in Them Thar Pages!,"First the bad, yep, I know . . . 1962 Switzerland was a different world from 21st century United States. Tournier, as all of us, was a product of his culture. Therefore some of his words may come across as sexist to those of us who have been born and breed to watch out for such things.Now for the good, for those readers able and willing to lay aside their own cultural biases there is real gold to be found in this extremely short, easy to read, book. Tournier calls for an openness of communication in marriage that is likely to improve the relationship of ANY couple that takes his words to heart. His words stand the test of time."
5,To Understand Each Other,"If married couples read this book, there would be less misunderstandings and miscommunications. It was wisely written several years back and it focuses on the importance of truly understanding your spouse more than having to agree with each other. When someone feels understood, it draws you closer than being in agreement. All of us want to be understood, knowing our other half truly understands what we are saying...whethey they agree or not. I wish I had this book 30 years ago at the beginning of our marriage...we recenty used it for pre-marital counseling for a newly married couple and they are off to such a better start becaouse of it. Understanding brings incredible closeness."
3,Reaffirms what we already know,"Quite a revealing book. This book just reaffirmed my suspicions about the Reagan family. Patti Davis is pretty jumpy in the timeline of the book. She attempts to give the impression that she is a ""together"" person now, but sounds like a person that has been through a lot of therapy and has still a long way to go. Some of her attempts at circumspect sound like her therapist wrote them. This book was not well written, but I'm glad I read it."
1,Glad It's Out of Print,"As a psychiatric nurse with 18 years experience, I felt that I had heard this story many times.......blame, blame, blame, never taking responsibility for one's own actions, then piously trying to sound magnanimous by all that ""forgiving"" at the end. I read this book after the Reagan funeral because I was so fascinated at watching this author's actions, facial expressions, and body language during this heart wrenching time. I only wish I could have been privy to her thoughts. What went on in her mind when she heard all those people get up and talk about her father and how he ended the evil empire? The copyright date on this book is 1992, a whole four years after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Yet, amazingly, she does not even mention it. I am glad I happened upon this book in my local library. I certainly would not have wanted her to profit one cent on my account."
1,Useless as a phrasebook,"This is not a phrasebook! It's a pocket dictionary. If I wanted a pocket dictionary, I would not have ordered something with ""phrase book"" in the title. There are only a handful of phrases in the entire book! Will return for something more useful. Will NOT recommend."
5,My sons favorite.,"My son loved this CD. He has outgrown it at 3, but this was he favoite he listened to it over and over."
5,fair and balanced,"This is one of the best books I've read. ever. Chatters not only shares his own theories, but he also gives the reader a complete picture of what theories are out there regarding the first Americans. When he recounts the details of the Kennewick man hearings, he doesn't slander those on the other side of the debate, but rather tries to give the reader the best view of what occured, though you can tell that the destructive actions of the corps sadden him. This is one of the easiest and most interesting reads. From the introduction where he theorizes about Kennewick man's death in story format, to the lawsuit over his remains, to the very detailed and great information about the morphology of the skull, and how it is similar to each group that is existent now and how it differs. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in archaeology."
3,Height a problem,"I read the book and found it wonderful.Kennewick man is 5'8"" (173 cm)and even though I have been to Hokkaido seen the Ainu People.I have never seen a 5'8"" Ainu.In fact at 5 '2"" they were about (160cm) they were a little shorter or the same height as me.I have allot of problems with the description of this ancient Ainu man.His enormous nose and the skull look different from Ainu.My field is Archeology and I have a masters in both archeology and anthropology. This smells of politics to me and believe me there is plenty of that in Archeology."
2,"Exciting start, then dragged next 100 pages, I stopped","I got past 100 pages, but found myself laboring through each page. The book started off great. I thought I was going to get a feel for how ""Kennewick Man"" lived. Instead it talked mostly about this group wanted the bones, that lawyer said that, that law was such-and-such, etc.. I fatigued of the use of the word ""intent"". The author should count how many times the word ""intent"" was used in the first 100 pages. It's a lot. It will give you an idea of how focused the book appears to be on the law relating to the handling of such archaeological finds.I was looking for a good insight into how Kennewick Man lived, not how the NAGPRA laws (relating to Native American archaeological finds) work. I would probably not recommend this book."
5,A Great Detective Story,"This book is a thrilling detective story of high adventure, intrigue, science and drama coming together around one of the most important archeological finds in North America. The author uses great skill and science to unravel the mystery of Kennewick Man."
4,Good old days,"I bought this album only because I wanted to listen to ""I miss you"". All the rest of the songs were similar to each other."
4,Sounds Great After All These Years,I found about Klymaxx on this site and had a laugh at their fierce 80's fashion. Love it. then i bought the C.D just to see what i would think of it. I had heard the song THE MEN ALL PAUSE and thought it Heaven!!! little did i know that the album includes many jams worth dancing all over your home to. These girls were hot!!! Probably still are!!The whole album is great actually and it gets better and better after every listen. Have a look at one of their clips on YouTube. They played their own instruments and are obviously super talented.Check it out!! You wont regret it!4 1/2 Stars
4,TIGHT ALBUM!,"This album is simply da bomb except that they dropped 2 songs from the original 1994 version. They dropped ""Locked Up"" by King George and ""Peace 2 Da Streets"" by all the West Coast Bad Boyz which are 2 hella tight songs! If anybody knows why they did this, please e-mail me. Anyway, the tightest songs on this album are Deep, Another Level, and Totally Insane, but the whole album is tight. Buy it!"
5,Underground Classic!!!!,"This is the best compilation album ever made!! No Limit was first started in California when this came out. Some of their best albums were put out at this time. Master P had some beef with one of their producers King George so when they re-released this in 1997, they cut his songs off the record but regardless, this is a classic and every No Limit fan that is still a fan needs this album."
5,another p classic,"a down south ,west coast classic.i have the original release and the 97` release 4 sale UNOPENED for decent price as well as other rare out of print cds.email."
3,Mixed Feelings . . .,"This CD is comprised of local rappers from North California with their songs, and was meant to gain them nationwide attention. Sadly, some of these artists should remain local. Gangsta rap dates all the way back to 1987 or so (remember NWA) and has not changed a bit all the way up to now. There is very little originality left in the songs produced today, and many tracks on this CD sound like carbon copies of earlier tracks on the same album. However, if every song was like that, this would have a one star rating. This CD has some highpoints, especially the thoughtful Stressed Out by Young Cellski. Another highlight is the song by Rappin' 4-Tay, but he was already nationally known. So the moral of the story is: some local artists do deserve to break out, but mostly they stay local because they aren't as talented as the rappers who hit it bigtime. If you feel like getting a gangsta rap compilation by lesser known artists, this is an ok buy."
4,One of my favorite old school Gospel rap groups,"E.T.W, D-boy (rip), PID, SFC, DII, etc. are truly missed, Transformation Crusade was one of my main favorite along with SFC, their message was clearer than todays Gospel rapper."
4,"A""Great Read"" for a scientific overview","I purchased Ms. Yoerg's book in San Diego (her hometown). Little did I know that I bought a signed copy! I felt the book was very interesting, and written with great wit. Ms. Yoerg knows her stuff, and has done extensive research in her field. I found her animal/insect comparisions informative, and quite funny (you'll know what I mean when you read about Portia, the spider). I am currently an undergraduate, and will be using her book for some of my research. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who wants a good overview of animal behavior and intelligence."
2,"OK, I get it. Can we move on ... please ... PLEASE","This was a very unpleasant read. I expected a book that would advocate a viewpoint of animal intelligence. Instead, it was a poorly rendered, highly defensive critique of various research, in places approaching a rant.I felt I was being pounded with examples that were not adequately organized nor presented in an interesting fashion. At various points, the author was dismissive about examples that I didn't feel she had established a basis for, leading me to wonder if the author was not indulging in her own unstated biases.What I felt were good points were shorted, and occurred so far back in the book that they aren't worth enduring what comes before."
1,Horrible,"Please don't invest your time or money on this video. the movie was dragging from the beginning until the end. My roommate rented it for becasue he thought it would be hilarious for me because i am big ""godfather"" fan. Dangerfield has lost his touch since the ""caddie Shack"". i lost the interest of the movie half-way through it."
5,Kevin McDonald is a comic genius!,"I rented this movie and ended up watching itat least 6 times. It isn't a sophisticated movie, but it's hilarious. Plus, it's one of those movies where you don't catch everything the first time around....a lot of little subtleties that enhance the movie's re-watchability. It's off-beat, weird, kooky and a lot of fun. Plus, you get to see Lou Ferrigno in drag. How can you go wrong??"
1,Worst Movie EVER!,Not funny at all. I knew I wasted my money 1 minute into it...good thing I only paid $2.00! I am a huge Rodney Dangerfield fan. He's the only one who dropped a couple of semi-funny lines. Very stupid. Not like the real Italians I grew up with....very bad acting.
3,"A little slow starting, but turned out to be a good comedy.","Rodeny Dangerfield is always great in any movie. Good slapstick comedy taken from the Godfather. Not a great movie, but a good movie. The outakes at the end are funny."
3,The Godson,"The Godson is a very good movie. One of the better comedies about crime. If you enjoy comedies, I reccomend this movie."
1,So stupid it's a crime.,"This movie was horrible. I can't believe I wasted fifty cents to rent this straight-to-video flop! If your going to make a spoof of ""The Godfather"", MAKE A DECENT ONE! Anyways, I believe this has been done before, with ""Mafia"". ""Mafia"" was a far better spoof than this one. If you are looking for a movie of this sort, please, stay FAR AWAY from this one, and rent ""Mafia"" instead.Rodney Dangerfield and Dom Deluise need better material to work with. They were desperate for money. This movie is so dumb that I cannot believe it was allowed to be filmed and sent out to the public! Who wrote this filth? A second grader? I could go on and on about how horrifyingly stupid this waste of celluloid is, but I'll leave the rest to your imagination. Then again, don't even give this movie a second thought.SKIP IT. I wish I could give it 0 stars."
4,Good help for beginners,"When I bought this book, I was still pretty new to Office. I found it very helpful in learning the features and little bits of each program. The index wasn't so great, but everything else was really helpful. Thanks for a good intro!"
2,Are you looking for that Stabbing Westward song?,"The c.d. could of been much better if they would of added the stabbing westward song which was one the movie preview...if your looking for that song its called ""save yourself"" by stabbing westward and its on their Darkest Days album."
4,It's got Curtis Mayfield... how bad could it be?,"This CD has an amazing Curtis Mayfield/Lauren Hill track. Even if that was all it had, it would be worth it."
4,Refreshing,"Initially, I didn't think too much of this cd, but as I continue to listen to it year after year, I realize it's really good. What I notice most is that it contains some pretty unique and fresh talents, and isn't your typical ""cookie cutter"" soundtrack. The first 5 songs are excellent, and after that, it's still really good. The only track I'm not too crazy about, is ""Goin' Crazy"". Lot's of good styles on here, ""Everlast"" to ""Bjork"", it's all pretty ""mod""."
4,"The case of the great soundtrack, to a horrible movie","I loved the CD for Busta, Alana, and that dynamic pairing of Lauryn Hill and the legendary Curtis Mayfield!! A couple of songs had turned me off. Who in their right mind gave Bjork a recording contract?? And also, could they have just left that song ""Going Crazy"" an instrumental?"
3,"The movie could have been better, but the music is great.","The Curtis Mayfield/Lauryn Hill song could be one of the best collaborations I've heard in a long time. I love both of these artists so much, to hear them together is a dream. Has anyone heard about any other collaborations between these two?"
3,Everything is Everything?,"Don't buy this soundtrack if you want to listen to Lauryn Hill's ""Everything is Everything."" I can't believe that that song would not be on this soundtrack!!! Who makes these soundtracks? That is the only song I remembered from the whole movie."
2,"A few okay songs, but not overall too good :(","first of all, where's the song from the movie's preview? i don't know what its called but i bought the soundtrack specifically for that song... 'you can't help me, you can't even help yourself!' that song... WHERE IS IT ?!? besides that big downside to this soundtrack, the other songs are good, especially Busta Rhymes' song and the Crash Test Dummies' song. if you really loved the movie, buy the soundtrack... but otherwise, its just a waste of money! BOOO!!!!"
2,"Nothing special, and who picked these games?","Well, now I have to say that almost all of these MLB/A&E DVD sets are at least very good. Sure, there's the 2131 game. But other than that, there isn't much worth watching more than once. Maybe the three home-run game and the documentary. Unless you're a Cal fan or really want to see the record-breaking game, take a pass."
5,The ultimate Cal Ripken Item!,A must have for any Oriole fan and Cal Ripken fan. Preserves the memories of his amazing career. A great collection of games.
4,Good classic movie,"As described, but a cheap DVD case to cut down on production costs.A great classic movie I can enjoy over and over again. Comedy - Horror"
3,I want more when I buy a DVD!,I have always been a fan of this movie. Loved is as a kid too. I feel that after I buy a DVD and I need some kind of special features. This is bare bones but I am still happy to have it in my collection.
1,Poor Product,"Pay attention to the disclaimer when it says that this item cannot be returned. I find it strange that it can be shipped TO me in all it's incendiary glory, but cannot be shipped back because it contains a solution that may be flamable. Most importantly the device cleans disks in a manner which is opposed to every disk cleaning convention ever recommended. It works in a circular manner rather than from the inside of the disk outward. The manufacturer isn't interested in returns, a fact I take to indicate their disdain for customers. Take my word for it, buy something else, that is unless you are a collector of useless gadgets."
5,Heartfelt and Inspiring,"Beverlye's book is a tribute to courage and determination, and makes you realize how precious life is, and that we should live every day to its fullest. Her artwork is beautiful, too."
1,New appears to be used?,The product is advertized as new oem brother product. upon installing new drum the starter paper that ejects upon start-up was not present and the print quality was worse that the unit being replaced. a series of black dots are now present in right hand column. Very dissappointed. I've installed one replacement prior to this and experienced none of the problems stated above. It wasn't worth the savings. I'll need to purchase new unit at brick & mortar store.
1,Rip off.,"I bought this and the ad said it was new and in the box. Well, it was used and essentially worn out. It was in the manufacturer's box, however. It was taped in the internal foil bag and the cardboard packaging around it was partially torn. I figured that someone probably bought the wrong one, returned it, and I bought the returned item. No such luck. It works, but has poor print quality -- prints too light, drum is scratched so there is toner ""fogging"" on printed sheets, spotting, etc. I'm not one to send things back -- because I don't want to waste my time or endure the hassle. Instead, I just never use the seller again and I recommend that others not use them either. This company was supposedly highly/well-rated and I bought the drum around September 2010. Maybe they have gotten worse sine the earlier ratings. Good luck."
1,Forget About It!,"While the price is as good as it gets, save your money and buy a new machine. I bought this drum unit, and it solved the problem I was having with the original unit, but gave me a whole new problem -- poor print quality. I then purchased a new cartridge, but that didn't improve the quality. So, after spending a little over $150, I've concluded that I wasted my money and I'm back to square one. Not good!"
1,BIG HUGE **WARNING** about Brother laser printers.,"You have to replace the drum unit every 3-4 toners! They told me this at Brother after I bought my printer and it started splotching after the 4th toner. The drum unit usually costs $200 (1/3 the cost of the machine itself). I did the math (price of ink jet printer and cartridges compared to price of Brother laser printer, toner and drum unit, even if you buy the drum unit at Amazon for $127, over the coarse of a year)- IT IS CHEAPER OVERALL TO BUY AN INK JET PRINTER (the conventional wisdom is that it is cheaper per page to buy a laser printer) and at least with an ink jet you get color!"
1,Not the old Corduroy,"This book shamelessly uses Don Freeman's adorable bear character to illustrate a charmless trip through Halloween images. Lisa, Corduroy's endearing owner in the orignal book, is missing entirely, as is Corduroy's urban home. The original Corduroy is a favorite in our family, but we regret buying this one."
3,"My preschooler is bewitched, but I'm bothered & bewildered","At age 2-3 years, my son has enjoyed lifting the flaps on this charming book, but a few minor issues bother me as we read it. First, the trick-or-treaters say, ""Trick-or-treat for Unicef!"" Nothing against Unicef, but after the first couple of times reading this aloud, it struck me as odd and I decided to leave it at ""Trick-or-treat."" Unfortunately my son had already memorized the Unicef part and ""corrects"" me as we read. Second, at Corduroy's Halloween party everyone bobs for apples. Ewwww! Does anyone do that anymore? Finally, at the store Corduroy buys ""everything he needs for his costume,"" but later we see his costume is the classic ghost: a sheet with eye holes. What exactly did he buy for *that*? Admittedly these are nitpicky points, however, and overall the book is an enjoyable intro to Halloween."
1,Pro-Abortion Halloween Book!,"I was disgusted to read the latest incarnation of Corduroy that promotes UNICEF, the U.N. fund that is supposed to help children, but also assists in promoting abortion. Page 10 shows trick-or-treaters shouting, ""Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF""! The evidence against UNICEF's involvement in abortion was so overwhelming that the Catholic Church ceased all donations in 1996! UNICEF has only gotten worse since then from a pro-life perspective. I urge all pro-life parents NOT to purchase this book. You will be as shocked as I was to see Corduroy used to promote the United Nations and it's worldwide campaign to make abortion more available."
4,Another Masterpiece from Smith,"Christopher is a gambler who wins a southern plantation in a card game. Kathleen (Katie) is a modern woman who feels trapped into going to Louisiana by her father's need to marry her off. After Christopher hits her brother, Katie charges to her brother's rescue and gives Christopher a black eye. Thus begins this tale.WANTON PLEASURE is a book full a intrigue and daring. Set in the pre-civil war Louisiana, the plantation way of life and the color lines are very much on display in this novel. It is interesting to read Christopher and Katie's story, but it is also interesting the role the Underground Railroad plays. If you are a fan of Smith, this is a must read. If you are a newcomer to Smith, read this book."
5,Dinner at Eight rates a 10!,"I received my copy of ""Dinner at Eight"" the text of the drama. It arrived in perfect shape, a clean, tight copy. It arrived way ahead of schedule with a kind note from the seller. This is how all things should arrive. Thank you for the splendid copy of the play and for your prompt and friendly service!"
1,Worthless product,How do you operate any laptop or computer without a hard drive. Are you serious? No where did it state it had no hard drive. What a rip off.
5,Very nice jigger,"This is well made and polished, so you'll have to work to keep it clean. This is the one to have out on display. It has room to spare at the top, so spilling isn't much of an issue. We also have the OXO jigger that has a rubber grip, so it doesn't show spots, but it spills easier."
2,German price for Chinese product,"I paid a premium price for this product which is described as being ""Designed and engineered in Germany"". Yes, it's a nice product as you would expect from Rosle, but it was only when I received the box that I found out that it was made in China and not Germany. I suppose this doesn't really make any difference, but I can't help feeling that I paid a huge premium for having someone in China stamp ""Rosle"" on this.And how much special effort is required to ""engineer"" a jigger, anyway? Eventually even the Chinese will be able to figure out how to do that without German assistance."
4,The Color of Love,"Dani Blair is an artist and the ex-girlfriend of a Detroit Piston basketball player, Dallas Laylock, in Philana Marie Boles', In The Paint. Even though Dallas and Dani have broken up, Dallas still tries to keep Dani while maintaining his player ways. Despite Dallas' advances, Dani does her best to resist him as she buries herself deep in her career--a career that leaves her dissatisfied as a artist. When Dani is laid-off at the art gallery where she works, she is forced to do some soul-searching. Not only must Dani deal with Dallas and her job woes, she finds herself dealing with a strained relationship with her best-friend, Kizzy and her foster mother.In The Paint is a fun romantic read. The story moves at a steady pace and the characters are well-developed. If you like romance, In The Paint will surely not disappoint.T. RHYTHM KNIGHTAPOOO BookClub"
2,Attachments are not correct for tonneau cover,the attachments are for a larger metal ball than is present on my undercover tonneau cover and the screw-off attachments have larger size threads/post than the attachments on my previous lift support
2,How disappointing,"I bought this DVD hoping to see at least a few of Mistico's matches, what I got was 40 minutes of ego stroking. Oh sure they have a few clips of his matches but that's all they are clips, most of the DVD is spent answering innane questions. I would have liked to see at least one complete match, but all you'll see is the same moves over and over. The clips don't even contain the original commentary by the announcers, so it's great if you like uncomfortable silences.The people who put this out seem more concerned with singing Mistico's praises than with displaying good Lucha Libre. All in all if you're a diehard Mistico fan go ahead and get this, but Lucha Libre fans should avoid this."
4,Entertaining action,"This movie is different from what you usually get, it remains unpredictable throughout, I question the ethics shown, and that for me is the main drawback, but it is a film you will want to come back to time and again just for the sheer entertainment, hence it is a good buy."
5,Dabaang,"Great movie. Actually a surprising movie since I am not a salman khan fan. But the music, cinematography and new actress was good."
5,Can't wait for Dabangg 2,Loved eveything about this movie - a bit over the top at times but that was what made it fun and enjoyable. DB2 from what I've read will not disappoint either..
3,"When Salman Khan plays uber-machismo to the hilt, it's a blast. Otherwise ...","Most of the film is fairly routine but well done however, when Salman Khan plays Uttar Pradeshi's uber-machismo to the hilt, it's a blast. And the action sequences are gloriously ridiculous. There are just not enough of those elements though, and the film drags a bit when they are absent."
4,Somehow it works,"Finally, a hit for Salman!Well, this takes parts of every popular film in recent years (the part stolen from Sherlock Holmes made me felt shamed) but somehow all the parts come together.The film is never going to be receiving awards, and will not be taken seriously, but that is the point.Dabaang is good fun, and good throwaway entertainment.You suspect the film-makers know its limitations, but at least they admit it. I was bored rigid by Once upon a time in Mumbai, another film that blatantly steals from other movies, but is excruciating due to the fact that the makers think they have created a work of art.In short: if it is between this and OUATIM, then I would much rather sit through this again."
4,an ok book,"smallville books are just too g rated. the show is not a children's show so why are all the books for the 10 and under group? this one finds the smallville teens working at a summer camp for children from metropolis and smallville combined for a week.pete gets a harebrained ideal on how to make some quick cash and will go to any extreme to get it even if it involves clark using his abilities and getting exposed. this book has an ok plot but the scenes with clark and lana, does the author even watch the show? get for real on those lines."
2,A little beyond my comprehension,"Loving the mother of our Lord I wanted to learn more about her --- this book, however, was written in style and based on a lot of religious history I am unfamiliar with; it was way above my comprehension level. This was not what I expected. I think for religious scholars this would be an excellent resource. For the novice on a quest to increase their faith, this is not the book to get."
1,All Fogged Up,"Despite the anti-fog coating my children are complaining, because the goggles are fogging up. They are new and I tried the anti-fog spray, but this model is not holding up to the speedo reputation. Speedos are generally great, but they did something different with the baja model.The fit is great, but if the children can not see much through the fog they don't use them unless they are swimming laps."
4,"My son loves them, but they give him a rash!","My son wore these all last year without any problem, they were the only goggles that he would wear. But this year, he has developed red bumps around the bottom parts of his eyes. When he tried using a scuba mask, it didn't cause any problem, but he can't swim in lessons with that. My only complaint is that it is really difficult to find out what ingredient in these goggles is causing this so that I can find new goggles that don't contain the allergen. Otherwise, great goggles!"
2,Was not as advertised,Cassette was described as new but it was obviously been used before. Cassette had been open before and had scratches on the cassette case.
4,Essentials 2 works great for me,"I am an experienced CorelDraw user who needed a budget version at work. I found that CorelDraw Essentials 2 is an excellent little program that delivers all the important functions of its bigger sister. I use it for posters and technical drawing.If you like CorelDraw, you'll like Essentials 2. If you want to get to know CorelDraw before committing to the full price, Essentials 2 is a great intro to the basics -- especially with the training CD. I've heard that CorelDraw takes some effort to get started in, which is fair; I've used it for so many years that it's second nature to me.The only functions that I really miss with Essentials 2 are:- being able to turn off the ""select items by clicking inside outline""- being able to set the drawing scale to other than 1:1"
3,Corel Software,"I found this dissapointing, although the included clip art was good. I really cannot complain too much as I got what I paid for -- it was a low sale price. It would probably be a good basic drawing program for those who had not used one before and would be satisfied with a program on that level."
1,Doesn't work for me!,"This program was recommmended to me. I purchased a computer controlled engraving system. I was told to purchaseEssentials to convert art to vectors so my machine could read and engrave it. The ""improved"" and ""updated"" program cannot do this. I am very disappointed in it, as the previous version was not available. Since the vector capability was not part of the ""improved"" version, the whole progarm is useless for my purpose."
1,P-U,This movie is beyond bad. I can't believe that John Heard signed up for this ... it's terrible. I've seen better acting in an elementary school play. Don't waste your money ... or better yet - buy my copy because I am embarrassed to have it in my collection!
5,Love the Drifter series.,Yet another of our friends in the Johnstone family. a good story of the Last gunfighter. Read the entire series and you will enjoy them all.

4,Estudios sobre Vibrio cholerae,"El libro me parece que está muy completo principalmente en lo que corresponde a las bases microbiológicas de Vibrio cholerae,nos un bastante información de lo que es la bacteria, la enfermedad y toda la información que se necesita saber acerca de ellas."
5,Fabulous!,"One thing about reading the Mitford Series, it makes you hungry! There are so many fabulous cooks in those books! You hear over and over about Esther's Orange Marmalade Cake, and in this cookbook you get the recipe, plus many more of the other famous recipes! Enjoy!"
5,a hit,the book is one of the gifts i gave my wife for her June Bday. She is an excellent chef and she had borrowrd a copy from a friend.now she has her ownT Y....jim
5,Jan Karon's Mitford Cookbook,"This is an excellent book on southern USA cooking and the recipes from the various books. The stories accompanying the recipes are good. The only problem that we have in Australia is trying to identify the ingredients: ie self-rising corn meal mix, which does not have an Australian equivalent, even though we have tried USA, South Africa and Google to try and find one. The book makes a beautiful gift and is a wonderful companion to the Mitford series. Well done, Jan Karon."
5,Jan Karon's Mitford Cookbook and Kitchen Reader,"After reading several of the Mitford Books, this edition finalized the bond between me, the reader, and the characters who populated the pages. In reading the different volumes, the reader becomes aware of the place that food occupies in the daily lives of the characters. Many times I marveled at Karon's ability to incorporate the preparation of meals to the story line. I was often tempted to seek out the recipes mentioned in her stories. Now that I own the Cookbook I enjoy preparing and sharing some of the very dishes that are attributed to the wonderful characters filling the Mitford Books."
4,Review of Miford Cookbook and Kitchen Reader,"The cookbook is a mixture of the best parts of the books and the wonderful recipes that were mentioned in the books. I love the way they are put together and lets me relive some of the books, while giving me wonderful recipes to try. Even after the Mitford series is over, these recipes will bring back memories of a delightful little town called Mitford."
2,Review of Jan Karon's Mitford Cookbook and Kitchen Reader,"This book appears to be more of a money-making grab by the author than a good recipe book. While it contains one recipe - the orange marmalade cake - I want, the balance I could probably have made without Karon's help. I suggest that people don't bother buying."
4,"If you love to read cookbooks, here's a good one for that purpose.","Jan Karon is the author of the Mitford novels, all of which are set in (where else?) the fictitious town of Mitford. Surrounding Father Tim, an Episcopalian priest, are dozens of quirky characters who have one thing in common. They all love food! I have not read any of these books, but I picked this one up because I love cookbooks that include related readings. I may have to read the novels now. The excerpts from them proved delightful, and the recipes make great reading. How well I'd do making the various dishes is, of course, another question. :-) If you enjoy this type of cookbook, this is one you ought not to miss."
3,Interesting look into a professional wrestlers life,My interest in the book was strictly personal. We were friends for many years and I wanted to see how true to life the book was written.He has been honest and open in reporting which gives his readers a true look into his life. All must agree it has been most interesting !!!!!!
3,It was ok,"Bobby Heenan was one of the greatest characters in the WWF from the mid-1980's to early 1990's. A funny guy who could use his gift of the gab to make his wrestlers look good and in later years was a humourous colour man.This book is not a biography like his first (classic) book, it is a self-help book that Heenan wrote after his cancer ordeal. The book itself is ok but I think that if I wanted to read self-help books, I would read one written by a qualified professional."
4,The Flower in Drama and Glamour: Theatre essays and criticism,"Excellent commentary on theater from one of the most revered critiques and playwrights of the 20th Century. Stark Young's comments are as relevant today as almost a century ago. His letter to Elenanora Duse is especially enlightening, particularly for any aspiring actors of today."
2,Nothing Special,"Published after Simak's retirement as a journalist Special Deliverance is a pretty standard quest novel where several characters are thrown together in a strange environment and have to solve the riddle of why they are there. Compared to some of Simak's earlier work the ensemble character development is quite good but the piece lacks much of the exuberance and rapid layering of big concepts that Simak does so well.The gist of the story is that 5 humans and one robot from different alternate history earths are brought together on a different but empty earth that contains a series of way stations that act as clues. Ala Pilgrim's Progress each characters represents different archetypes but the analogies are rather blunt.The writing is OK, but taken as a whole it feels like the premise of an RPG. The other reviewers here seemed to like it but my recommendation - give it a pass. Simak has written better."
3,"sad, final years of a legend","It's still hard to believe that Joe is gone. There will be no long hoped for Clash reunion, just a nice bunch of memories and some of the greatest songs ever committed to vinyl. As for the doc - it was a sober reminder for both the fan - and Joe - of how far the fall can be. Joe was starting from scratch with a scrappy young band, an indie label with no money and his past always hanging over his head. You can see a bit of weariness in his eyes and hear it in his voice - but on stage, though less animated, he was still in control. And while his later work wasn't anywhere near the quality of his Clash work, it was still vibrant and relevant. How many 40+ year old rockers can say that? Overall though - a little depressing..."
2,Documentaries for dummies.,"I'm sick of documentaries being directed towards people with no attention span. The order of the day is a hodge-podge of fast cut scenes, music 3 times louder than a speakers voice, and random cartoon/movie clips. This doc flies past topics so quickly that it leaves you screaming, ""wait, go back to that!"", or they'll spend too much time on a trivia fact that will leave you screaming, ""who cares?!""There's some cool stuff to see here, you'll find out some things but overall you can skip it. I love The Clash, their music and their message, but Joe doesn't need to be hero-worshiped, the music speaks for itself. Skip this and listen to some old albums instead."
1,This wasnt born so much as it fell out,"This plays more like somebody passed a video camera around at a wake. All the excellent concert footage was talked over by someone saying something that mattered to only two people, Joe and who ever was talking. Nothing new was revealed if you were already a fan. This was an hour plus of Joe Strummers friends giving him verbal fellatio."
4,"Excellent, but one quibble...","This is a terrific documentary about the life and times of the late Joe Strummer, a fascinating artist who left us much too soon. The quality of the archival material is excellent (who knew there were home movies of a very young Joe?)and the interviews are top-notch. This is highly recommended for Clash fans and fans of Strummer's post-Clash work with the Mescaleros. My only quibble is that none of the interview subjects are identified as they talk about Joe. We can pick out Bono and Johnny Depp, yes, and longtime fans can spot Palmolive and Pearl Harbour, but there are family members and friends who talk about Joe, but without giving us context of who they are. It gets to be annoying later in the film when musicians who played with Joe post-Clash talk about his later years. The candor of those being interviewed and the footage make up for that, though."
3,For Clash lovers,"I enjoyed this film when I saw it at a theater with a bunch of rowdy patrons. However, upon second viewing it seemed boring and completely formulaic."
4,great doc about a great artist,"So, I was trying to get my hands on this movie for a little while. I tried to download it, then it seemed to only be available from Europe, but, I finally got a hold of it from Amazon.It's really a great documentary. It's well put-together and will give you a lot of good insight on the life and legacy of Joe Strummer: whether you know him from the 101ers, The Clash, The Mescaleros, etc."
2,An Overly-Long Look at the Life of Joe Strummer,"The Future is Unwritten is a documentary focusing on the life of Joe Strummer, the deceased leader of The Clash. The film has its fans, but it didn't do much for me. For most of the film, celebrities talk about how much they liked The Clash. Few of the celebs have anything insightful to say and many of them are stoned out of their gourds. The film also depresses the viewer by detailing Strummer's post-Clash life, which was a long slide into obscurity. Finally, at two hours, it is far too long.To be fair, the film does have some good clips of The Clash performing and some good information about Strummer's early life.Passionate Clash fans will want to see this one, but everyone else should skip it."
1,Utterly ahistorical,"The author clearly is no student of Middle East history. Her thesis: the June 1967 war was not a product of 19 years of Arab-Israeli tensions but was rather cooked up by Moscow!Interesting only as a relic of the type of cold war thinking that has been thoroughly discredited by events,Rather silly."
2,Problem with costume,"When we opened the package two days before Halloween, we discovered that the robe was missing from it. Thankfully we had an old robe around. If you order it, make sure you check it as soon as it arrives. The eye glasses were a little uncomfortable, but my son loved the effect of them."
3,It would help to know what connector this used!,"Might be a great product, but Amazon's description is not useful. What connector does it use? Is it a standard mini-connector?UPDATE 8/20/04Well, I can now confirm this has a standard mini-connector. It works well with my Samsung phone. A cut above no-name quality, with a price that makes losing them tolerable. I'd increase my rating to 5 stars (ok, one off for the crummy amazon product description), but I don't see how to do that when editing an older comment."
1,"Very poorly made, fell apart on second use...","I used the headset maybe once or twice, and the earpiece came out with the speaker itself. The entire product is poorly made."
1,"Oh, No",The tip of the plug broke off in my phone and I had to replace the entire phone. The !@#$%^& <$10 headset ended up costing me an additional $85 and 30 minutes on the phone with the provider. Stay away from this one.
3,Nice and pleasant,"Nice to listen to, but enjoyed the standards more. Great job for a young, up-and-coming jazz great."
2,Fritz,Obviously very accomplished technically.Unfortunately and not surprising inthis age group too imbued with own composing skills.Consequently much of the cd is a steady state of endless notes an chords in rapid fire succession.
2,Toilet tank liner kit review,"Modern toilet tanks do not have 4 flat sides as they did many years ago. The kit comes with foam that does not lend itself to bending to the curved contours of current tank designs. The adhesive is also inadequate in its ability to help keep the foam attached to the curves.Great concept, but it needs to be updated with a material that can conform to multiple curves found in virtually all modern toilet tanks."
5,FoxTrot Ridge,"This book brought back alot of memories, good and bad. There were several incidents that I had forgotten but after reading the book it jogged my memory.I think Mark Woodruff did an excellent job in putting this book together. Each word that I had said to Mark was put into print.In the thirteen months that I was in Vietnam it will always be this one day that I remember.Thanks, Mark for your dedication and esprit de corps."
2,was there and wonder?,"I'm Starting to wonder if there were two battles on 28 may by outfits known as ""fox 2/3"" ? I was at the time Sgt.Rick Fhrye; the plt. com. of third herd. I remember a few names; Joe Quinn,a kid named Kinkade and few more now and then. But I can recall the events of that 12 hrs like it was last night. If you were ther and remember me....I'd like to hear from you; for9rick@aol.com `"
4,A Look at Eldredge and Inspiration for Your Day!,"This thin, but very thought-provoking, harcover volume will give you a good idea of what to expect from the other books by John Eldredge.Along with the beautiful pictures and some inspriational quotes, it boils down much of 'Journey of Desire' and presents some of the ideas drawn out in 'Wild at Heart'. And - besides perhaps whetting your appetite for more Eldredge - this book will provide inspiration on your personal journey.For women or men, brand-new or long-time Christians, this actually will make a nice gift for those who are looking for encouragement or 'something a little more' from life. (In fact, I have to get a new one after giving my first one away!)While I do not agree with everything Eldredge writes, his books have encouraged me to think about what I believe and search other writings. That is worth a lot!"
5,Fresh Air for a Weary Soul!,"Dare To Deisre contains the ageless message of Christ's Love for each of us in a very cool giftbook. The color photography is nourishing to the soul as it is woven thematically with the text. As with Sacred Romance, John Eldredge captures the heart from the first page, then re-evangelizes it with the reality of Love's Passion.This book is indeed a distillation of John (and Brent's) other books (Sacred Romance, The Journey of Desire, and Wild At Heart), and is an excellent introduction to his writings, his heart for the church and for all compromised souls who long to re-connect with their true heart's desires. I was personally impacted in a life-changing way the morning I read it.This is a book I would feel good about giving to anyone who yearns for a more fulfilling life, and is searching for the courage to breathe in that ecstatic atmosphere as they Dare To Desire."
2,Didn't notice a difference,"I was hoping that based on the majority of excellent reviews I read, and other Jason products I use and love, that this one would work to eliminate my dandruff and itchy scalp, but it didn't. I used it according to the directions every other day for 10 days and although I had slightly less noticable itching, I still have dandruff. I was careful to gently massage my scalp and leave it on for the sufficient time in the shower. Maybe I didn't give it enough time, however, I noticed that several reviews said that it worked quickly for them. The smell is quite strong but it did not put me off, and I am picky about smell of products I wear. It just smells like tea tree oil to me, not too medicinal. So, unfortunately, I'm discouraged and was hoping for immediate results and will need to find another 'kind' natural product that does not test on animals."
1,Not worth it,"This product did not work for me. The scalp is still there, and the shampoo does not do a job at cleaning my hair. Not worth it."
2,Not a big fan,I really like the conditioner of this product but was not impressed with the shampoo. I kept feeling like i had to put more on my hair for it to do anything. It never really felt that clean and it almost seemed to make my hair feel like it was in worse shape. The smell is also not very pleasant. Wouldn't really recommend it.
3,Consistency Shocked me,I was excited to try the Aloe Vera Shampoo because I read good reviews. I've only used it once so my review will be brief.I like the products it is a natural product so it feels pretty lightweight on my hair. Also left my hair pretty soft but not as soft as when I condition so I am still waiting for the conditioner so I can do a whole wash routine and really decide how i like the product.
1,Stinky,"This shampoo stinks... like, it smells bad and it stinks at what it's supposed to do. The smell is overpowering, and requires more than one wash to remove. As far as dandruff relief goes, it's really not that great either. I suppose it's better than not using dandruff shampoo, but I'd almost rather suffer the flakes than walk around reeking of strange soap and eucalyptus all day. And I love the smell of eucalyptus... but this stuff just isn't right."
1,Natural is just a gimmick- contains Parabens and more,"Except for the aloe vera there is nothing natural about this product. I love the smell though, it has a light fresh smell that I find refreshing. However what is so natural about the following ingredients that are found in this product: Methylparaben, Propylparaben, PhenoxyethaCompare those preservatives above to thsse used in Aubrey Organic's shampoos: Aubrey's Preservative (Citrus Seed Extract, Vitamin A, C, E)Which of these are more natural?This company uses organic and natural as gimmicks and a marketing ploy. There is no difference between this product and any other one you find on the shelf that doesnt use the word natural.If you want a natural shampoo try another brand and read the ingredients before buying. Parabens are parabens, harmful chemicals are just that even if they are preceded by the world natural."
3,Is this a biodegradable shampoo suitable for camping purposes?,"This shampoo sounds like it might be biodegradable and thus environmentally safe to use when camping. I can't tell from the ingredients, but if someone knows, please add a review because I would love to use this instead of the age-old camping shampoo that makes hair feel like felt."
1,They want me to change my review,"This company contacted me by email asking me to remove my bad review because they sent us expiring products ,and they would refund my money ,,well i havent gotten my money back yet its been about 3 weeks and nothing ,Im retired Army and i believe people should stand behind their word ,so far they havent , im very disappointed in this company .Ill post or change this if they want to stand by their word but so far this company seems kinda shadey."
2,Cartridge smudges,"We ordered a new HP toner cartridge from [...], and it smudged immediately after printing the cleaning sheet. We returned it and got another cartridge, which smudged after a handful of pages. We returned that, and now have a credit from Amazon. Maybe the obsolete (more than 10 years) cartridges just can't be expected to work right, but databazaar acted professionally."
1,No more lower price from Amazon,"Amazon didn't honor my order even they accepted it and confirmed. I think they just posted lower prices to lure you in then say ""Sorry it's a typo"". What's a joke for a big company like Amazon. They should be responsible for what they advertised and honor it even it is a mistake."
5,Good product - Original cartridge hard to find,"This HP LaserJet Printer Cartridge is for a printer that hasn't been supported for some time. I was happy to find that a new HP Cartridge was actually available. The product was shipped promptly and arrived as described.Update: Cartridge started leaking and I sent it back. Good service. I got a full refund, including shipping."
1,shower mixer,I have wasted 200 dollars in water bills for this faucet so far. We have changed washers 3 times and a new valve stem was purcashed and yet the cold water side continues to run. We even tried tapered valve washer. Its evident this valve is out of spec. I am not happy since we have to rip the wall apart to replace this mixer now. Its brand new and has never worked right.
4,"Good book, good weapon","The book was completely helpful in teaching me how to build an effective tennisball bazooka. In other books I've read on homemade ""tennisball launchers"" the tennisballs on go so far, with this bazooka I can't even find my tennisballs."
1,Junk,How to make an overly complicated potato gun using harder to find and more dangerous materials. Build a spud gun with a modded sprinkler valve instead.
5,Superb Quality!,I have been using RHINOTEK ink for 3 years and I will never pay Epson prices again. The quality of my images are superb! I get more pages out of a RHINOTEK cartridge than I have using Epson. I also like purchasing from a company that supports environmental causes like their commitment to saving the Rhinos from the poachers.
2,Kind of pointless!,"I really like the idea behind these, and my kids like the concept, too. Maybe these would be cool for a just-turned 3 year old, but for anyone older, not so much. They're really SHORT, only about an inch high. That isn't really. . . the towering monster that we're going for here! I do like that they're made out of foam, it keeps them from slipping, however. . . the foam doesn't hold up as well as the plastic. I wish there were a version in-between these and the taller, but plastic versions out there."
5,Fun for my 4 year old!,"My 4 year old daughter got these for her birthday and REALLY likes them! She's the very active type...not very interested in sit-down toys. These keep her moving while challenging her balance and coordination. She could do them pretty well right away, but there are always those sticky situations that require a little more skill. I've noticed they're a little more of a challenge for some, but not too hard."
3,"Fun, but for how long....","I bought this toy for my daughter's fourth birthday party to have some toys for the boys that were invited. The kids (boys and girls alike) liked it, and it got put to good use, however, mydaughters were bored with this toy quite fast. They haven't used them in about 2 weeks. I think it is good to train balance, so I will put it away to rotate toys in the summer....Plus I will put them out on playdates and birthday parties for the other kids. The monster feet are really well made I think, so there is no complaint there. I just gave it lower rating because my kids interest is not quite there - maybe it's a girl thing. :)"
4,"Overlong, but Suspenseful and Wonderfully Nasty","I'm sorry to say that of Shakespeare's four main tragedies (Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Macbeth) I think I like this one least. Othello has such suspense, and plays with the idea of fate controlling our every moves. MacBeth is the dark play that deals with our fears and our primal ids. Hamlet is the supreme story that sums up all of life's ups and downs. And Lear, well...Lear is about relationships. It's best scenes involve communication between two souls, or lack thereof (though Gloucester's blinding scene is quite dramatic). Sadly, Lear is just too long for my liking, and I longed to hear more from the daughters--Regan and Goneril are so nasty you love to hate them, and Cordelia is so gentle that you love to love her. I must say that this is a wonderful play, filled with action and double-crossing, sure to satisfy."
3,Great for Streaming,"I purchased this movie earlier this week as it was one of my all-time favorites and after the purchase was complete I found out that Amazon streaming does not contain subtitles. My husband is hearing impaired and needs subtitles in order to hear everything in the movie. Great movie, but I will not be buying many Amazon Instant Stream movies in the future because of this shortcoming."
5,I love this movie,I have watched it twice and I love it. It's a great movie and funny too at the same time
5,A cut above,"This CD is way above anything I've heard in a long time. The lyrics capture you from the start and the more you listen, the more layers of truth you find. The message goes deeper each listen. The musicians give a perfect blend. They fit together like hand in glove. As you journey through each track, you begin to feel The Turning is taking you somewhere -- somewhere they've been already. How old are these guys? How can they have this much insight? How can you have this much fun listening to one CD? Every song is a winner."
2,It Didn't Happen!,"I read this book when it was released in Nov 98 and was depressed for weeks! I decided to wait until some of the ""disaster dates"" in early 99 passed before following the author's advice. Nothing that he predicted came true, so I tossed the book. I ordered another copy so I can dig it out and reread it the next time hysterical Christian leaders create a ""coming disaster""! Maybe it will save me weeks of depression."
4,"""I wish we'd all been ready""","The song ""I Wish We'd All Been Ready"" by Larry Norman goes hand in hand with what the author is trying to say in this book. His overall message is clear: prepare for what may lie ahead now. Although he says the same thing over three different ways or so, the book provides a compelling glimpse of what just may wait around the corner - October 1999 or so. Buy this book, read it, and take steps now to be ready. Don't panic - God is in control of all things! ""And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose."" Romans 8:28Even if you aren't the slightest bit ""religious"", you should still check out this book. It is very practical for anyone and everyone."
1,Awsome exciting anime!... no just dull,"Giant bugs, futuristic mecha, guns, sci-fi stuff cool. That may be the first impression any one who has never seen a decent anime title may have felt when they saw this. The problem with this it is a mediocre story with decent action absolutely mutilated by terrible characters! The main character whines non-stop, and all the others are about as deep as filter paper. The desperate attempt at some original plot at the end is laughable and pathetic, I just feel sorry for the poor animators who spent countless hours on this crap."
4,There was no DVD pamphlet in part.,"It is writing from Japan. When it purchases in Japan, it is the software of $590.Although I was looking forward to it and the package was opened, the pamphlet was not contained in DVD-No.2.Is this unavoidable one? There is a somewhat regrettable feeling.BLUE GENDER very likes the appearance which regains a man's strength and a woman's tenderness."
3,Strangely attractive anime,"Well, I don't really share the enthusiasm of most of the reviewers here, I found Blue Gender mediocre in every aspect. The story has some nice moments but ultimately it's nothing spcial, I mean the hero wakes up after years of cryogenetic sleep to find the earth devastated and almost conquered by alien bugs, it's something between Starship Troopers and Demolition Man...The animation isn't that good either , not much detail is shown and many static screens remind of older times. The drawing of the main characters is nice, but the mecha gear and the bugs are mostly unimaginative.But even though the title has these disadvantages , it somehow manages to grip you and make you wanna see more. The most interesting thing here is the relationship between the two protagoninsts and it's the only thing the creators seem to have really cared about.This title is like a good B-movie of the anime gender, it has it's faults but in the end it's entertaining"
5,Great Anime,"I first viewed episodes of Blue Gender on Adult Swim and I was intrigued by it. I bought the volumes and have seen pretty much all the show it is a great anime with many surprising elements to be in just one anime such as a complex love story, great animation, and a spectacular sci-fi plot. I realise that there is one person who reviewed this and said that it was boring. Well that is total crap, this anime is constantly keeping you barely on the edge of your seat with intense drama. Also the main character doesnt whine that much, i mean after he is Awoken he is very jittery and freaking but he develops into a regular spartan at some points. And dont just take my word for it about that other reviewer, just look at all the other great reviews, there are over 20 of them."
3,Good story hampered by rushed character development,"If you like Starship Troopers, this is good series for you. However, if you are a Gundam fan, you may be disappointed. The story is really good, but the eveloution of the main character, Yuji, from annoying, sniveling, idiot into a sage warrior fighting to save the Earth and mankind from themselves, happens in these quick jarring transitions. I really didn't buy it. the female lead character, Marlene, tranforms from a heartless warrior into a compassionate human being. Her eveloution seems more realistic and better thought out. You care about her more than Yuji. Over all great action, good story. I recommend it."
4,One of the best anime series,It's not the best anime series but for me it's one of the best in my 10 favorites. Highly recommended and it has a very good price for 9 DVDs. Buy it if you like the science fiction series or anime in general.
2,I am forced to disagree- very ordinary,"Haven't we all seen this one before? Or so it seems. So-so animation (very flat), bog-standard plot, little depth, or,indeed, anything distinctive to distinguish it from the seething mass of so-so anime. Also, extremely annoying characters, I just wanted to slap the whiny little gits.I must make a confession, this review is only for the first three DVDs. My wife and I simply gave up, and lost the urge to go any further. We ended up watching 'Samurai Champloo' instead. That was a bit like moving from me singing in the shower (off key) to a Bach Brandenburg Concerto. You get the idea..."
3,Not so good,"The story is pretty good and I would probably have liked it better if it hadn't been so over praised. The animation is not that great. More like 1980's Saturday morning cartoon. In addition the main character is pretty annoying and wimpy, so way too much time is spent with him whining, screaming or being indecisive. Not essential."
2,Bum-rushed through history,"This is not a ""delightful romp"" through history, but rather, the longest magazine article ever written. 2000 years are glossed over, and the reader is given nothing more than crumbs to nibble on. For example, during WW 2, Europe's Jews flocked to Nice trying to escape the Nazis and it wasn't long before the Nazis soon followed. This could have been fleshed out into something real - actually it could have been a book unto itself - but here it's given a scant 12 pages of exploration. By the end of the book, I felt like I just watched a parade go by. Kanigel is a wonderful writer, but this book is just too superficial to provide any real satisfaction."
3,Another case of a disappointing sequel,"This movie was disappointing, although not a total washout. Martin Lawrence as Bilal still made me laugh, but some of the scenes had recycled jokes and even preachy tones. The scenes where Kamron (of Young Black Teenagers) as Jamal, a white kid who talks black, shows up were so gimmicky it was scary. But one funny scene was when the party was hopping from apartment to apartment while Boyz II Men's ""Motownphilly"" was playing in the background. Still, all of the best jokes were given away in the trailers, and they weren't even all that funny. The following two sequels are even worse, so just stick with the first House Party."
4,Great But same as original,This one is good but same as original it is basically the same as the original except it is a pj party if u liked the part 1 then u will like this one
4,happy as punch,"this arrived very quickly and in great shape, packed well in a box with the larger bubble wrap. It will make a nice gift for Christmas :) havn't watched it yet so I could not give it the 5th star without knowing if it will work or not, but if it's wrapping is any indication, I have faith that it will work just fine :)"
3,Not So Good,I hadn't seen this movie in years and had forgotten how good is WASN'T. It's no comparison to House Party 1!
3,THIS SEQUEL IS A BIT TOO MORALISTIC AT TIMES,"IN THE 1ST SEQUEL, KID GOES TO COLLEGE BUT, REALIZES THAT HE LEFT HIS COLLEGE MONEY WITH PLAY WHO'S GIVEN THE MONEY AWAY TO A CON ARTIST CLAIMING TO BE A RECORD COMPANY EXECUTIVE. MOST OF THE FUNNIEST MOMENTS COME FROM MARTIN LAWRENCE, WHO RETURNS AS BILAL. THIS SEQUEL IS A LITTLE BIT MORALISTIC AT TIMES, WHICH IS NOT WHAT THE HOUSE PARTY TRADITION IS ABOUT. ESCAPES A TWO STAR RATING ONLY BECAUSE IT IS THAT MUCH BETTER THAN THE NEXT TWO HOUSE PARTIES THAT WOULD FOLLOW."
5,A Classic,"I could go on forever about how great this book is. Raskin is by turns witty, sincere, sarcastic, and cynical. The characters' lives and problems are very real, and they confront their problems (and each other) in ways that most women will find familiar. I actually first read this in college; young enough to be the daughter of any of the main characters. Nevertheless, I identified with them and their struggles. A must read for you and all your girlfriends."
5,Great Purchase!,This was a great purchase. The ink was shipped and delivered when promised. The packaging was good. I am very happy with this purchase.
2,Do not buy this ...,"Although several reviewers have had good luck with this ""compatible"" cartridge, my HP-430 plotter worked for a limited time w/ the first one installed, then refused to print with the second ""brand-new"" unit. I used my postal scale to compare the weight of a genuine ""HP - 40"" with these. My ""used-up"" one was only 3-4 grams lighter than brand-new and the new one was spot-on the same weight. It may be that used immediately after arrival, these cartridges will be OK, however my plotter cartridge is changed only 4-5 times a year so the extra expense of a ***** rated genuine HP cartridge that has worked every time I need one no matter when purchased is a better value ..."
1,Not a genuine HP,"If you liked to be cheated buy this item. It is a white box special ""compatible"" cartridge. It is NOT a genuine HP cartridge."
3,Too many interruptions,"This is a great concept with a so-so follow-through. The book has some fine photos and lackluster text. The real disappointment is the CD's, which unfortunately feature the exposition of Bill Kurtis over the actual recordings. Instead of minutes of actual news broadcasts knitted together with seconds of exposition by Bill Kurtis, we get lengthy introductions by Kurtis with snippets of the news broadcasts. Bottom line: Worth having, but falls short of potential."
3,Incorrect Photos,"I was initially impressed with this book, until I began to read..... I noticed several Inaccuracies, most blatantly on p 68, The rocket photo referred to as ""Apollo 11"" is NOT Apollo 11, also on p 70 inset photos are referred to as ""Armstrong descends the Lunar Module"" the photos are NOT of Armstrong. Unfortunately I would have to oversee any use of this book by my Son, I would NOT want him to incorrectly absorb even the most minute piece of ""false"" history.Since the book already contains detailed commentary on each event, maybe the CDs could have contained more historical clips and less ""setup"" for each clip."
2,"Good Concept, Poor Realization","The book itself contains the expected photos from the events. The accompanying text seemed appropriate for someone with little or no knowledge of 20th century history. While this is not necessarily a fault, it reduces the value of the book to those of us familiar with at least the broad outlines and major events.But the CDs are seriously annoying. Since these accompany a book, I expected that the book would provide the context (date/time/source of the broadcast, and perhaps some historical background) and the CDs themselves would contain minimal narration. Instead, I'd estimate there's five minutes of narration-blather for every minute of historical recording. And blather it is-- often irritatingly banal, platitudinous, and cliched.Did I mention that the narrator sometimes actually talks OVER the historical recordings? This book/recording package could have been so much better."
4,This book is an excellent value...,"This book will give substance to any grandparent or parent sitting down to tell children about the past. It is incredibly eerie to hear Cronkite speak of the death of JFK and the broadcast of Challenger's explosion, but nothing matches the incredible drama of Hank Morrison telling of the explosion of the Hindenburg. I am not a big fan of Bill Kurtis, but he does an adequate, if not slightly overbearing job of setting up each broadcast clip. The packaging of the book is nothing to write home about, but the CD's are worth the price of the book themselves."
3,"Too Much Bill Kurtis, Not Enough Actual Broadcasts","The book itself is a very well-assembled compilation of the major events of the last 60 years, with a lot of great photographs. I was disappointed with the CD's,however. I like Bill Kurtis, but I'd rather hear less of his narration and more of the actual broadcasts. He is simply reciting what's in the book. I also dread the fact that Princess Di's death is put on the same level as Pearl Harbor, D-Day, and JFK's assasination."
4,We Interrupt this Broadcast,"This book allows people to relive those news events that made history and truly were worthy of interrupting regular-scheduled programming. It seems that whenever we see the words ""special report"" or something similar on a television or hear it on the radio our heart skips a beat. Particularly since 9-11 this is true. But not everytime disaster or worse is being reported. Recently in Minnesota they interrupted programming with a ""special report"" only to inform us our professional hockey team had been sold. Big deal!But those items included in this book are the real deal. Attacks, political happenings, murders, etc. all make their way into this book. For the real enthusiast, there are two CDs included so the events may be relived over again.This book is a good summary of what happened, written by Bill Kurtis, who reported many of them first hand. While not the best book ever written, it will hit home to many, with an eerie sense of the fears and concerns first broadcast."
5,"Excellent book, would recommend strongly",This book is a wonderful collection of time stoping events in both the US and the world. I have used this resource in my 5th grade class a number of times and highly recommend it for anyone's library.
4,A great book filled with historical events of the century,"Recounting some of the most memorable events of the past century, We Interrupt This Broadcast gives real audio of the actual events. This book is great for both remembering and learning about some of the most memorable and horrific events of recent history. Although some of the writing in the book is a bit disjointed, the overall concept gives the reader a bit of history by allowing them to hear it as it actually happened. Wonderful for high school students to learn of a history that is typically taught from a outside point of view."
2,"Disappointing, typical lazy reporter work","While it's an interesting idea, the weighing of the choices (espcially the '90's events) seems idiotic. Also, the photo of the Apollo 11 launch is glaringly wrong. Coupled with the interminable lead-ins by Bill Kurtis, this is a disappoinment for $35+. I really don't see how OJ, Waco, TWA 800, Atlanta bombings compare to some of the other seminal events of our lifetime. Lazy research."
3,Some great advice but a little much,I am very much into holistic health care but I found this book to be a little too sappy for me. At times the book is written in the manner of a yoga teacher leading a class through poses. There are some good meditation techniques but I think there are a few better natural pregnancy books out there.
2,disappointed,I was expecting much more from this book. It didn't really cover anything in depth and it didn't inform me of anything I hadn't heard from talking to other pregnant mom's. I was hoping to learn something or discover something wonderful or find out about some great holistic aspect of pregnancy but I didn't find any of that. I was disappointed.
5,Enhanced with graphics from the princeps edition,"Published to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the birth of Romania's national poet, Poems And Prose Of Mihai Eminescu is an impressive showcase for a remarkable talent, translated into English. Mihai Eminescu (1850-1889) was a leading nineteenth-century cultural figure who poems and prose had a profound and lasting influence on Romanian culture and literature. This edition of his poetry and prose is enhanced with graphics from the princeps edition published in 1883, and an introduction on the life and work of Eminescu by Kurt W. Treptow. Poems And Prose Of Mihai Eminescu will aptly serve to introduce a new generation of readers and students to this outstanding man of letters who was also a philosopher, journalist, and keen observer of the human scene."
1,Shipping & Handling Rip Off,"The OKI Ink ribbon cartridges were just what I ordered at a good price $1.99 each, but the shipping and handling was $39.96 and I guarantee the cost to ship to us was not more than $5.00. The OKI Ink Cartridges are little ribbon boxes and may weight a 1/4 pound at most, it was shipped in a plastic sleeve envelope with no packaging protection via U.S. Postal Service. I am very disappointed in the way this company does business by gouging the customer for shipping and handling charges. Will not buy from them again."
1,Okidata Black Nylon Ribbon,"I never received the ribbon. It was sent via USPS, the tracking number read that it had been delivered; however the package never made it to the building."
3,Text book or study manual,Accidentaly bought the study manual instead of the book. Don't let sellers rip you off. Read the small print!
1,Received broken/unusable product due to poor packaging,"HoneyCombs Capsicum Extract Alcohol Free (Liquid), 1 ozUnfortunately, when I received this product the bottle of extract had broken (it was a glass bottle put into a mailing envelop,e with no padding to protect from damage) so I never even got to use the product. It was a mess. The product itself may have been fine but HoneyComb needs to pay more attention to how thye ship breakable items. I couldn't even return the item because it was such a mess."
2,Good thing it was cheap.,"Product shipped promply, I used a half dropper everyday plus cayenne pepper on all my low-fat food and used this product for 3 weeks, which is all that comes in a bottle. I did not lose a pound."
2,Capsicum Extract,Shipped promptly. Found it did not do as much as I anticipated. Did not feel as energized and did not lose weight as I wanted.
2,Not too good,You have to use too much to get expected effect. Bottle last just few days. Little dissapointing compare to similar products.
2,Capsicum Extract,I don't believe this works. It is spicy hot but doesn't seem to speed up my metabolism or curb my appetite or cravings at all.
4,Excellent General Overview in <500 pages,"If you are looking for a solid overview of Europe since 1945 in less than 500 pages, this is it. Sure, in other books you can find more detail about each event or with all points of view presented, but I haven't seen any books so balanced and so concise. I wish I could find other important topics covered in a similar fashion (e.g. WWI and WWII).Regarding style, Hitchcock keeps things interesting. Organizationally, each of the 12 or so chapters covers a particular aspect of European history and in the beginning of each chapter he sents forth his themes, which is very helpful. At the end, you feel that not only do you understand the events, but the underlying themes and how they are manifested in current events.Overall, excellent and very enjoyable as an introduction to the period. If you are more of an expert, this is not for you."
2,rabid anti-communist,It would have been a valuable history if the author had been more objective. Knowing a little about communist influence and tactics is essential to be able to read between the lines of the author's anti-communism and his resort to one sided propaganda. If you can sort out the facts from the unfortunate anti-communist babel it is a helpful book. For every criticism of the Communist it is easy to point out the exact kind of tactic used by the supporters of the anti-communists on every issue. I am no sympathizer with Communist tactics as Stalin ruined any chance of the United States having a left-wing party to counteract American imperialism. If the author had just stuck to the facts instead of editorializing after all most every sentence it would not have become so tiresome a book to read.
1,"Advetised as OEM, but was remanufactured","Maybe OEM has nothing to do with whether something is remanufactured, but it was not what I expected."
4,Pleasntly surprise with this great deal,The cartridge is working great and plan to get another one for stock-pile. It is nice to find an affordable way to keep my great HP 4L running.
1,Complete Horror,"Product a total joke as it is not a package of toner for a working printer. Toner leaked all over, nearly destroyed the printer and the cartiridge was worthless. Don't buy unless you like to waste money, ruin equipment and never work on deadline."
1,Ink cartridge,"After paying $75 for this item, it does not work properly. It puts ink all over the paper and is useless."
2,another disappointment,"I was so happy to find this product for my old laser printer at such a reasonable price. However, after several weeks of use, the items printed came out dirty and streaked. Therefore, I cannot use the printer."
3,Printer cartridge for HP LaserJet 4 ML/4L series,"The original HP box with the cartridge I received looks like it was damaged.I suspect that is why it was considerably less expensive than if I had purchasedit from HP directly. This is not the external packaging used to send it to me.There was no damage externally.Caveat emptor - this was not advertised to be damaged, but usable packaging."
1,Duped!,"I ordered this Ink jet cartridge from Amazon because of Amazon's outstanding reputation. What a disappointment! This is the worst cartridge that I have ever purchased. Copies are worse than copies from the cartridge I replaced. This cartridge produces ""copies with a dark film across the entire page making it impossible to read. I plan to contact Amazon for a refund."
1,Bad product,"This product was awful. The box it came in looked liked its been through a storm. But, worst part about it was that it was a faulty toner. Very disappointed- wouldn't recommend!"
4,"21st Century Dietary Supplement Glucosamine & Chondroitin, Double Strength, 400 capsules","21st Century Dietary Supplement Glucosamine & Chondroitin, Double Strength, 400 capsulesGood product I take this for awhile it is working well with me. Thank you."
2,Silverado Mirror Replacement,This mirror shakes and vibrates constantly while driving at 25 mph and over. Cheaper than OEM but quality not even close. Buy this if you can handle the annoyance of the vibration. Buy OEM if you can't.
1,Problems,Installed fine. The mirror glass itself vibrates a lot. First time I used the heated mirror option glass cracked in half. I personally do not recomend buying this spend more money for other products.
4,HiTor Neo cat diet,"Used this product that I heard about for cats with CRF(chronic renal failure-kidney disease) My cat is a finnicky eater and was not eating the prescription foods(Royal Canin, Iams, Hills K/D) too well and losing weight. She took a liking to this food and eats regularly now. I actually mix half of Royal canin with 1/2 of the high tor neo and she seems to be doing very well and has gained her weight back.The product is supposed to be low in protein and phosphorous which is essential for cats with kidney disease.I give the product a thumbs up and so does Smokey my cat. I have already purchased 2 more cases the second time around as my cat has taken a liking to it and it helps save on shipping."
1,Cat hated it,"My cat wouldn't even touch this. He sniffed it, looked at me, and tried to bury it. (Digging at the kitchen tile, unfortunately for him, did not work.) I tried on three different occasions, thinking that maybe his belly was just upset that day from the CRF. He never would eat it. Now, I've got a case (minus three cans) of it. Guess I'll donate it to the local animal shelter."
5,Hi-Tor Neo Diet for Cats Review,This product is an excellent value for all cats that have renal failure. My cat cannot get enough of it. I have saved alot of money by not buying through my vet. The nutritional guidelines for this product is very comparable to the product my vet offers needed for cats that have renal failure.
1,"poor ingredients, poor taste","poor ingredients, poor taste. junk food for cats. neither cat will touch this food even if mixed with other food. I did not even bother to donate it to the animal shelter, why torture other cats?"
2,to each his own,"i bought 80 bucks worth of this because of the other reviews of this product. my cat won't eat it. period. so just like in people, taste is subjective. buy a small amount and try it out first. hopefully your cat will love it. i'm sure it is a good product quality-wise, which is why i didn't rate it lower."
4,Great food for my geriatric cat...,"My 15 year old cat is happier eating this stuff rather than just dry Iam's food. He has kidney disfunction, but he seems to be doing better now despite the failing condition for his age. The only problem I have with ordering from this supplier on amazon.com is this: I got clobbered with spyware. I'd rather go to: [...]. and order it direct. kk"
5,A Food She Will Eat,It was hard to get my cat to eat another manufacturer's similar product but she actually LIKES the Hi-Tor Neo Diet!!
3,Not sure if this food is the best option.,I'm not convinced on this brand yet but we are trying it. A crf cat needs low protein and low phosphorous. The data on this from Tanya's guide for Crf cats shows this has pretty high phosphorous for a renal food. .72% vs .38% on the K/D. Also has 36% protein vs. 28% with the K/D. Its more equal to senior formula foods than the prescription foods. It might not be the best choice. It does have high fat though vs other brands which is my hope for keeping some weight on my 18 year old crf cat.
3,"OK, not the wonder food I was hoping for","My cat has renal disease and has been on Hill's k/d dry and canned food for over a year. Recently she was getting picky about eating and not wanting the either type of the canned k/d. Based on the Amazon reviews, I ordered the Hi-Tor Neo Diet hoping that she would love it. At first she did love it (something new/different I think), but now she is very ambivalent towards it and lately has preferred the k/d. Perhaps it is due simply to her personality or perhaps it is due to her stage of renal disease, but I have not seen any difference between k/d and the Hi-Tor Neo. Other than the renal disease, she doesn't have any health issues and is still pretty frisky for being 16 years old."
2,FINICKY EATER,"I have tried every type of low ph food for one of our cats, and of all I have tried, this is the one she absolutely refuses to eat. Even tried mixing it with her other low ph food which she will eat, but no dice. So if your cat is a finicky eater, you may need to pass on this one."
5,Good Product&#65281;,My pets po and Chouchou love it very much!!Ship quickly and Product is very good. Be worth to buy it!I will buy again!
1,Didn't last,"After only a month-and-a-half of relatively light use (about 4 faxes received per day), this ink cartridge is already running out of ink. The faxes are faint and hard to read. I expect more from a $34 cartridge."
1,Refill ink cartridge for Canon bubble jet fax,"I am not at all a satisfied customer. This item, a refill in a generic package, which would be OK with me if it worked, is a mistake which found me. I installed the cartridge in the fax, could see the ink rolling around in the clear side of the cartridge, but could not get it to print AT ALL, not even a smudge. I must have cleaned the head two dozen times, trying to unstop what I imagined were plugged orifices. After an hour of tinkering, I finally got faint lines of scanned material to print with lines of skip through lines of type. I had no alternative but to resort to a more expensive cartridge from a famous bbox having learned my lesson with refills. I have already paid Amazon for the thing but it was a useless expense. I think I should be reimbursed for my expense but I don't know where to find the fine print. Cartridge came from RAVI."
5,excellent,I'm very happy with this product and the service the vendor has provided. I recommend dealing with them in the future.
5,Classic series,"I bought this because of the found memory of the Liquid Television shorts I watched when I was a kid, and today the show still delivers all of the action and psychological intrigue I remember so fondly."
1,What started out so excellent became... this.,"AEon Flux: The Complete Animated Series (Peter Chung, 1996)I remember, back in the day, seeing the first eight episodes of the first iteration of AEon Flux on MTV, and it was just about the coolest thing imaginable. And then, well, something went horribly, horribly wrong. The end result? AEon Flux: The Complete Animated Series.The great thing about those initial episodes was their complete lack of context. The viewer was thrust into a world entirely different than ours, but still recognizable. We were given some characters, a plot, and no dialogue whatsoever; we had to figure out what was going on for ourselves. The big mistake, of course, is giving the characters context, giving them dialogue. Suddenly the mystery, the challenge, of the series is gone, and we're left with nothing more than another cartoon-- and not one that's in any way interesting. I gave it my best shot, but I couldn't even manage to finish watching it. (zero)"
3,It is what I remember.,To tell you the truth this show was not as good as I remember. Much better than the Hollywood movie.
4,Solid,"I purchased this box set about 2 years ago and every now and then I still find myself popping into my DVD player... there's a lot of very impressive work here.My only gripe with it is Peter Chung's commentary. He spends a least 50% of the time saying ""uummmm..."" and then when he finally gets around to finishing his thought it's usually something like, ""Yea, I'm just really hard pressed to comment on this..."" are you kidding me?Other than that, great DVDs. 4 stars."
5,What you're looking for,All of the animated content remastered on DVD. This is just what I was looking for when I wanted to relive this great show. No subtitles are available though unfortunately.
2,Not as good as I Remember,"I never got to see alot of this when it was on. But it, like alot of the shows I used to watch, is not as good as I remember."
1,They changed the dialogue?,"I used to like this show. I would have probably bought the DVD set, but then I read that they've changed the dialogue? I mean, are you kidding me? After all the complaining about Lucas ruining Star Wars, now this guy decides to do the same thing to this little-known show?No way. Forget it. I liked the show, but not enough to put up with this crap. There are so many other movies and TV shows out there to buy on DVD. Let these screwballs who refuse to give customers the product they want go and play with themselves."
3,Doesn't it seem a bit pricey?,"I may buy it but the only reason I didn't give it five stars is the price. 220 minutes for $27.29 works out to only 8.1 minutes per dollar. Looking at other TV/DVDs that aired last season: Alias4 23.6 mins/$, Lost 28.5 mins/$, Desperate Housewives 26.5 mins/$. I'm just not sure a ten year old show is worth three times as much as a current series.And I thought Paramount Home Video had insain prices with $111.99 for ST:Next Generation 5. But that's 10.4 mins/dollar which is still better than Aeon Flux!Mins per dollar isn't the best way to judge a purchace but three times as expensive gives me pause."
1,You have got to be kidding!!,"Although beautifully presented the is one of the worst movies I have seen in a while. I found it childish and negative. On the plus side, lots of very attractive women in form fitting clothes. If I ever watch it again I'll just turn down the sound and enjoy the scenery:)"
5,Excellent,It was great to see these Aeon Flux shows again after all of this time. I very much enjoyed them a great 3 Disk package not too shabby.
4,good box set,"I loved this when it aired and after watching this DVD all these years later I have to say that it withstood the test of time. A great series conveneiently collected in a licely packaged box set. Also, I honestly didnt even notice the dialog changes."
4,Woot!,"I knocked off 1 star because 3 of the episodes I wanted commentary on didn't have it. Even though it was targeted at adult males, I watched this as a little girl. It was on TV not only at the peak of MTVs coolness, but the peak of TVs coolness in general; the early & mid 90s...........................................................................It had all the episodes, commentary, & even all the Liquid Television episodes; exactly what I wanted ^__^"
4,Very good,"Like Never Let Me Go, which was recorded about a year earlier, this is a collaboration with Stan's then-wife, organist, Shirley Scott. And like the earlier album, it opens with Lloyd Price's ""Trouble"". Right off the bat, you get the feeling that this album will sound totally different from its predecessor. For one, it doesn't have that late-night feel - this is more like the album you'd put on at a jazz party, or maybe while driving. The rhythm section here is obviously heavier - to my ears that's a plus. Otis Finch is a chunky drummer, and Bob Cranshaw was great pretty much anywhere.The real magic ingredient, though, is guitarist Kenny Burrell. It's hard for me to think of any guitarist I'd rather hear with a 60s organ ensemble. He's smooth and sophisticated, gritty and earthy, all at the same time. Stan's playing is wonderfully soulful.I wouldn't quite put this in the 1st tier of Stan albums, though maybe over time my assessment it will improve. I certainly prefer it to Never Let Me Go."
3,Nice companion for an Industrial Chemistry Course,"It's well suited as home reference material for chemistry students taking a industrial chemistry course. Even professors (and not only in IndChem) can get some ideas for exams here.This book is a little bit old, but some of its contents offer an alternative to consulting Kirk-Othmer's Encyclopedia."
1,Extremely elementary,"This book may be helpful if you've never used an oscilloscope before and don't know where to start. If you've used a scope before I don't think you'll see anything in here you don't already know. Much of the information is taken from free literature available on the Tektronix website, (...)"
1,Not ready for publication,"Only the most basic information, much of it from TEK. Numerous typos and spelling errors, redundent (and trivial) information, make this a bad buy. I just bought an OScope and this book was of minimal help teaching me how to use it."
3,"Good book, bad editing.","The book does a good job at covering the basics (really basic), but since chapter 1 you start noticing a lot of typos, figures don't match the text explanations, some test answers are wrong, etc. It looks like they finished the book in a hurry, the editors did not do their job. I would wait for a second edition if it ever gets printed."
1,Not a Book for Learning,"This book attempts to teach electronics through the oscilloscope and poorly. It tells you to turn on the oscilloscope then do math and turn a knob, then sine wave wise only, you learn little oscilloscope and little electronics, a complete waste. It is full of typos as if someone wrote it on a bench during a lunch break. This book is meant to sell a DR. wrote this for Big Sams. It really just says look we Pub., a oscilloscope book and the Author , he knows electronics. He writes like a retard, so he must be brillant. Don't buy it because the typos are like 1+2=4"
1,Not worth the money,Banks'book Oscilloscope Guide uses large print and offers little information and there are mistakes...There is some useful information there but not worth the high price.
2,How did this get published?,"This book has some basic knowledge of the use of an oscilloscope, but not even enough to get started on. I'm just starting to use oscilloscopes, and I know more already then was in this book. Granted, there were a few things worth knowing in the book;...Most of the examples couldn't even be seen because they are so small, and I noticed several typo's. There could be typo's regarding really important aspects of using the oscilloscope, we'll never know."
1,No Recommended,I would not recommend to anyone who wants to buy this books...lots of errors!They should have someone proofread it.
1,"The irony of ""typos""","For all the reviewers here who complain about typos, perhaps they need to go back to school too.The correct spellings are ""redundant"" and ""contributor""."
4,Its about time a book like this has been written !,"I'm read a lot of books on scopes, and for the first time Dr. Banks put it in the right perspective. Hats off to him. Dr. Ray Bamberry/ JPL"
5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT!,"EXCELLENT PRODUCT! I WAS FORCED TO BUY A NO NAME BRAND RIBBON AT A LOCAL OFFICE SUPPLY STORE AND IT WAS NEVER RIGHT...STREAKED, SMEARED, SMUDGED, ETC. I HAD ALWAYS USED AND PURCHASED ORIGINAL OKI BRAND RIBBONS, BUT THEY DIDN'T CARRY THEM ANY MORE....SO I BOUGHT THE OTHER ONES. BAD MISTAKE! AS SOON AS I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT AND GOT BACK TO THE ORIGINAL (MORE EXPENSIVE OF COURSE BUT WORTH IT) NO MORE STREAKING OR ISSUES AT ALL! WORKS GREAT AND A VERY INTEGRAL PART OF MY BUSINESS, SO VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. BUY THIS, NOT THE CHEAP KNOCK OFFS!"
2,How can know the technical data for this item?,"I want to buy this item. But I can't find the technical data for this item, such as CD ROM or DVD ROM, RAM size and others?"
4,Not Just for History Buffs,"The History Channel covers the period from the sacking of Rome by the Goths to the beginning of the crusades. Fair warning: it's pretty Dark. Hence the title.With such a large period of time and space (Europe and Britain) to cover, clearly only a few specifics can emerge. Several specific dates are mentioned, using a readable graphic and maps as necessary to impress. If a teacher of high school history were to use this DVD in a classroom and warn the students to take notes, there'd be a good bit of meat here for an exam afterward.Along with the graphics and maps, and the scholarly talking heads, there are numerous recreations of events. And at one point I had to close my eyes and rely on the commentary only, so I'm not sure quite how gory it gets. If you see it, let me know how much of the Red Eagle is depicted.A good lesson for those who feel they are underprivileged nowadays."
3,"Educative, Interesting, covers a lot of areas, revealing","Its a good show, I thought they touched upon a majority of the areas of this time, but thats all,They have not done too much more detailing on these areas, hence this dvd is only about 30 mins or so,its a good dvd, and the narration is also quite good..."
4,The Dark Ages,"A very useful review of the times and famous people involved in that, for many, mysterious era of history."
4,Good for some students,"Mixed bag, but when the chapters are good, they're really good. The most lacking chapter is the one on Alaric where they've glossed over his background (why the Visigoths wanted to take over Rome in the first place) and rush through the sacking of Rome in just under 8 minutes. Other chapters are AMAZING: Rise of Christianity (Clovis) and the Fravks v. Moors in Ch8 especially . Here's a full lineup if it helps anyone:-Introduction (1:08)-The Sacking of Rome (7:22)-The Waning Empire (4:58)-Common Thread of Christianity (10:12)-An Empire Strikes Back (8:33)-The Plague (9:06)-Men of Cloth, Men of Letters (10:40)-A Holy War (7:59)-The Greatest King (9:37)-The Vikings (10:04)-The Crusades (10:01)"
3,A little disappointed...,"As I stated in the title, after watching this documentary I stayed little disappointed. Only good thing about it, that this is only available documentary about early middle ages that exist in English. If not, it would receive two. Anyway the beginning was promising, the first problems began with Justinian and cheap acting. After that things went worse with portrayal of Charlemagne, it was more said about his love affairs than his campaigns and renovation of Europe. Then I left stunned - there wasn't any mention about HRE, but instead some story about one viking warlord, totally uncomparable with other rulers in DA! After all there wasn't any mention about Basil II, one of greatest persons on the end of early medieval time, there were some sad explanations about beginning of crusades, but more child stories then real history. Sad. It started very promising, but last 30 minutes was BIG waste of time.Three stars."
3,Generally Ignores the Byzantine Empire,"At this time in history, the Byzantine Empire was more civilized and interesting than the Western Empire. While this video does mention Justinian and Theodora, it does so negatively, and otherwise ignores the East. Yet it was the East that recaptured large portions of the Western Empire and established some measure of order at its western capital of Ravenna.Plenty of mention of Alaric, Clovis and Charlemagne, but none of Belisarius or Theodoric, both of whom played major roles in Italy.A nice feature in the bonus tracks is a long program on the Plague, which I thought was better than the main program."
4,History Buff,"This is a very interesting depiction of the time of the Middle Ages. Very interesting. I also like the French Revolution DVD from the History Channel, easily one of my favorites!"
3,Could've been better,"This documentary covers a lot of Europe's medieval history but puts too much emphasis on the North. Countries like France and England are addressed far more than others. There is no explanation of how the Moors actually brought the light of civilization to Spain, turning the region of modern Andalucía into a jewel of culture, education, science, music and fashion several centuries before the Italian-impulsed Renaissance. One even wonders if there is some post 9/11 prejudice against Islam in this program. Nevertheless, the production level and the academic interviews are of the highest quality. Watch it, but do more research on your own to get the full picture!"
1,History Channel is only for speaking English people,"I have tried to purchase movies at History Channel many times, but I can never do it. The problem is that I need to use close caption to help me to understand completely because I can read and write English language, yet my skills to understand spoken English are limited. In this case, I even tried to get to know if this movie had close caption as exception, but it had not, as usual. I question myself why History Channel can have close caption at TV, but they do not have it in the movies they sell. I realize that if they consider adding caption to their movies, their sells would improve greatly. According to the criteria here exposed, you could realized that I did not take the time to look at the movie; therefore, this is the reason for I gave only one star."
4,fast shipping,"Great show, fast shipping. But I found out to late I could have gotten it off iTunes for $4! Im going to give it to my Dad for XMAS>"
1,Shoddy Product,"I can understand why a drama might not have subtitles, though even that is difficult to swallow nowadays. For a narrated history documentary not to have subtitles or captioning for the hearing impaired is simply shocking, shameful and shoddy!"
4,Focused thematic overview of the Early Middle Ages,"If you're looking for a good overview of the major themes of the Early Middle Ages, this is a good place to start. Picking up on the recent spate of ""Late Antiquity"" scholarship, it begins the story of the Early Middle Ages with fall of Rome. There are rampaging Visigoths aplenty as Rome falls to Alaric and his pals in 410 AD.The section on Byzantium will look familiar to those who have seen the History Channel series on ""Engineering An Empire"" - but still fits nicely here. Historical re-enactments are better than average, and the scholars slightly less bizarre than the usual History Channel lot."
4,"Seems to work well, but gets very hot...","This equalizer works fine and is easy to use. But I am uncomfortable with the high heat it generates. It gets VERY hot on the back panel around the sub output. It gets so hot in that area, it hurts to keep a finger there. This is very strange as the heat is generated even when the EQ it not wired to anything but the A/C power. It is not on top of warm equipment either. I have observed this high-heat behavior on two units. Two different calls to Behringer yielded two results. The first time it was suggested that I exchange the device, which I did. The second time I was told the heat was O.K. Weee, multiple choice from customer support."
4,solid eq,"Product works very effectively and the bypass feature is very useful and the bass feature will be useful. all controls work as they should, easy balanced set-up."
2,Wonderful till it breaks,"I've had 2 and the second one blew up on me. The first developed a thundery noise - must be a dry joint inside. Yes they are very good bits of kit when they work, but the electronics are not well made and will let you down. Both these went within 3 years, not more than 15 gigs each."
5,Behringer FBQ3102 31-Band Stereo Graphic Equalizer,"Really like it. The summing Sub Out is a handy feature, the eq sounds good. Does what it's supposed to."
3,alright,when i got it it was good but it was a little bury but only if you look close from afar it looks good but up close it bury
2,Does not serve as a useful introduction,"I begin reading this because I wanted a clear, concise and short introduction to the history of medieval England. While it is short, it is not very clear or concise. The author's stilted writing is replete with insider information. Basic concepts and terms are not explained, an absolute must for an introduction to medieval history. To be fair to the author, synthesizing fragmented, biased and oftentimes fictional textual information with archaeology and other social science research is quite difficult. I am disapponted nevertheless, and will get my introduction to medieval England from elsewhere."
3,The Oxford Illustrated History of Medieval England.,This is a well constructed book which contains much valuable and interesting information together with an excellent selection of illustrations.Unfortunately the author's use of rather poor English grammar combined with convoluted and involved sentences tends to detract from reading enjoyment Nobody wishes to have to re-read sentences in order to obtain the sense in them.
3,Old School Gals,"This inexpensive CD features 3 great ladies of country. The song choices are not the greatest but considering the low cost, it was still worth it."
5,"Three cheers. Hip, hip, hooray!","I was thrilled to see this title being sold, more thrilled after listening to it. They are the best of the classic country ladies. Their voices are better than ever. It made me laugh and cry. I'll be listening to this CD often. I'm so glad they cut it before Ms. Wyette's death, but I'm sure she's thrilled to make it to ""Hillbilly Heaven.""If you don't buy anything else this year, this is a must-have."
1,why the change?,"I remember when Makari first came out. If I spent too much time in the sun, I would purchase the caviar cream to get my face to match the rest of my body. Results usually showed within a week. Efficient, and produced results. Loved it, and was worth the price tag.*NOW*, ON THE OTHER HAND, I don't know what they did, but I think they changed the formula. Rapid results, gone. The minimal results do not last. I think my face lifted half a shade or so, but was back to normal halfway through the jar.I would say it is a good moisturizer, when you first put it on, but about a half an hour later, my skin actually feels dry and tight.Very disappointed. This was my go-to beauty product. Search continues."
2,Smoother skin,"I tried it until the jar was empty and my skin has a much smoother appearance, but I did not notice any lighter appearance. I did have a few people to compliment me on my skin, but I think the product is priced way too high for what it claims to do. I have tried another less expensive product for fading black spots and pigmentations on skin and it works much better for only 1/4 of the price of this product. If you want an overpriced moisterizer this product is for you."
1,Skip this expensive moisturizer...,"for the Oralight pills which work much better. I am in agreement with avidreader's long review (thanks for the input!): this cream is too expensive to not yield quick and lasting results. It moisturizes well, and a dab does yield good coverage on the face, but 30ml is too little for nearly $60, and even that tiny dab feels like $2 down the pores! I recommend the Oralight pills that really do do the lightening and add energy (because of the vitamins)."
3,Blotch be Gone,So far the cream is working fairly well. Purchased to get rid of facial scars. It works pretty slowly but it does appear to be working. I just put a little on each scar twice a day. Its not too greasy and the scars are blending in.
3,"Beautiful, impressive, but not practical!","If you are looking for beautiful dishes to please vegetarian guests (or bosses!, this is a wonderful book. With beautiful pictures, delicious recipies, and easy to follow directions, this is an excellent selection if you are looking for some impressive dishes. It also makes a beautiful gift.However... as a practical, daily or regularly used cookbook, I would suggest you look elsewhere. For example, if you are hoping this will be a starting guide as you become a vegetarian, I would point you toward the ""Vegetarian Times"" books... The dishes can be a bit complex and time consuming to prepare. This is a wonderful 'company' cookbook - impressive weekend or special occasion cooking, but a bit much for the everyday rigors of family dining!!!"
3,Plot was lost,Plot was lost I thought it was going to be about how Thor was created. But it went somewhere else. I tink I will give this to someone else. Maybe my co-workers to give to his son. But I think he will but dissappointed.
4,Better than I thought.,"I was recommended this by an Anon, was a pretty darn good animated flick, it was a little weird to see him not wielding the good old hammer, but of course he wasn't born with it in hand, a few anachronisms such as Odin having full use of both of his eyes through most of it, but yeah, worth a watch at the very least."
3,It's okay - mostly kid fare,"I'm not normally a big fan of the heroes being kids but that's not what this is exactly. This is the story of a hero before he was a hero. The fact that many characters are ""simplified"" in this is probably because it's more geared toward kids than adults. As an adult, I felt it was okay. Guessing kids would like it more than I did.Other than being more kid oriented the only problem I had with it was the way they treated the Valkyrie. They must've been on vacation because the Amazons were hired to play thier parts. To my knowledge the Valkyrie are not anti-male isolationists as the Amazons are. It is thier job to carry the fallen heroes to hall of (I forget - heroes?).This is a kind of growing up story for Thor. If you want Thor the hero, skip it. If his growing up story interests you give it a try. The highlight for me was a backstory from when Odin clashed with Surtur."
3,Tales of Asgard Review,"This movie felt more like a prequel to the new live-action Thor movie. It also falls right into the ""Young (list character here) movies/shows that get done. Like Young Sherlock Holmes, Young Indiana Jones, Superboy, ect.It wasn't bad. The animation and action was decent enough, though dialogue at times felt contrived.In the end, I'd rather watch Hulk vs. Thor again as it's a show featuring an adult Thor, not a child.I do believe that this is the last of the animated Marvel movies coming from Lionsgate til we hear if Disney/Marvel will broker another deal with them or someone else for more."
3,Mildly entertaining. Worth a rental but glad i didn't buy the disc.,"I am not a Thor expert. I have only recently been interested in the character. I am enjoyed him in the Ultimate Avengers animated movies and I really enjoyed him in Hulk vs., and loved the new movie. as one reviewer said, this is really Saturday morning cartoon worthy. It made me feel like i was watching Yu-gi-oh or something. Rent it but don't buy it. I would suggest buy it for smaller kids but there are a few scenes with mild violence that a smaller kid may not need to see."
5,It was a lovely tale!,"I loved how sweet Loki was in this, and how close he was to Odin, the spot where he was hurt and Loki was crying made me cry. All it all, this was a brilliant tale with Thor and the Warrior's Three with he and Loki on their journey. I enjoyed it very much. :D"
4,nice story,"this tells of the early years of the thunderer, specifically a point in time with which many people will be able to associate. his journey takes some turns, and he does not yet have his full abilities."
3,"The animation and action is good, but the plot isn't written well...","While this movie's animation and action is good, its plot isn't very well written. Because fo this movie's flaws, I wasn't able to find this movie more than passable. 5/10"
4,A fresh take on an old family,"If you are looking for a hammer wielding, bolt throwing Thor you are in the wrong place. This is not a bad thing though, if you can keep an open mind. Thor: Tales of Asgard takes a chance on exploring some of the history of a hero before he becomes a hero. The idea may not be new, but it is well done here in both thought and execution. I have been collecting Thor comics for 30 years, and I enjoyed presenting something a bit more accessible to my pre-teen son. Action, humor, suspense and a moral--it's all here."
2,Very Disappointing,"On the heels of such a good live action film, I expected more from this animated feature. Some other reviewer compared it to a Saturday morning kid's cartoon and that is an apt description. The 20 minute short featuring Thor on the ""Hulk vs."" Blu-ray is ten times the feature that this is. Honestly, it looks like a quickly put together after-thought released to cash in on the Thor craze after the movie...which is probably exactly what it is."
2,not the worst thing I ever saw,"the art is good the story stinks.I give it 2 stars because in spite of it being terrible, the animation was good.I reserve one star for the likes of Ultimate Avengers.Tales of Asgard ought to be much more sci-fi that this thing.Check out the mid-era Kirby stuff, very exotic and cosmic.This was merely a lame viking story, Thor isn't a viking, he's one that vikings worshiped as a god.There is nothing mythic or otherworldly about this story.It's like the writers said, 'well the landscape is weird and there are monsters... good enough'I fought to stay tuned into the duration of this movie.Boring."
1,"Misogyny and Cultural Misappropriation, Oh My!","I realize this is an animated movie, but I guess I've developed an expectation for quality of storyline from animation like ""Spirited Away."" Not only does this film fall back on tired cliches, but it twists the source of these myths and mythological concepts in such a manner to be insulting to the original culture as well as the viewer. The easiest example of this is the treatment of Valkyries. I don't expect the film to pass the Bechdel test (more than one woman having an intelligent conversation on a topic *other* than men), but to portray Valkyries as man-haters?! Really? Read a book. Or maybe learn something about a mythos before you stomp all over it.Crap entertainment and, even worse, boring crap entertainment."
1,disappointed....,"I'm a Thor/mythology fan, and loved the Kirby/Lee ""Tale of Asgard."" I also really love the Warriors Three. This film was a major disappointment. It was slow with really stilted dialog. Asgard looked like a typical medieval village built around a mountain, with nothing magical about it. It was a basic ""coming of age"" story focused on young Thor, with occasional input from Loki. The Warriors Three are totally wasted as characters, and we barely get a hint of the interplay between them we've come to love in the comics. I wish I had rented it, because I doubt I will watch it again. At least it has flying horses."
2,"Crap, Crap, Crap","Did not like it. It was boring and stupid. Animation sucked too. The idea of Thor having a sword was not popping for me. Loki was cool and I loved the brief scene with The Enchantress but other than that the movie sucked. I hate the ""Warriors 3"" they are so bunk and dumb. Odin was cool, the Valkries were aight and Sif was working. But overall the story was cruddy -the storm giants were cool, but a little too tame for my tastes. I guess there wasnt enough going on and too much of the uninteresting dominated the whole thing. I wouldnt waste any money on this, just Netflix it if you must or wait until it comes on Cartoon Network or HUB channel."
2,Not very good.,This movie is a total stinker. It is sort of a cross between the Ben 10 and Teen Titans cartoons. What is the point of making a film about a 15 year old Thor? The cover sleave shows an adult Thor that will trick people into buying the dvd. This is blatant false advertising. The movie itself is boring. Do not waste your money on this crap of a cartoon.
4,Interesting premise and ending,"I must admit, the ending was not what I expected. I should have guessed it, however, since Nashe didn't seem to have any other way out. He had no money, no prospects, and no friends left after all that he went through. It sure made me think about the choices we make as humans and how sometimes we rely on fate just a tad more than we should. To that end, the book deals with that theme, while experimenting with servitude, loneliness, friendship and broken hopes.One more thing: while the book was good, Auster has forgotten his witty, to-the-point writing style he used so successfully in 'The Invention of Solitude', 'Hand to Mouth' and 'In the Country of Last Things'. It doesn't mean that the book is boring - not at all - but I loved Auster in those books and would like to see that style return. Thus, 4 stars."
1,Just Awful,"Someone gave me this book alonf with Michael Cunningham's THE HOURS, telling me that both were part of a group of talented young writers. Let me tell you, Paul Auster couldn't be Michael Cunningham's copy editor. There are more cliches in the first 5 pages of this book than you could find in a dime store mystery novel. The characters are flat, the story ludicrous. It tries hard to be some kind of masonic allegory but is so obvious it becomes aggravating. I read the NY Times review that praises the book for it's series of ""ricocheting"" coincidences, and I kept waiting for that to happen. IN fact, nothing ricochets. Everything thuds. IF you are a lover of language, don't bother with Auster."
1,worst read I've had in ages,"Flat, boring, pointless, plain stupid. Guy gets too pretentious with all that bunch of alleged existencial symbolism, whatever it is supposed to mean. His writing style is quite poor, he uses tons of cliches, and presumes to be telling more than he does. Too kitshy to be true.I would give it a -5 star if I could. Just stay away from this garbage."
5,Paul Auster's best novel,"Since there are many detailed reviews of this novel, I will keep mine brief. If you have not read any novels by Paul Auster and are wondering where to start, I would recommend this one, what I consider his best. If you have read other novels of his but not this one, this will not disappoint."
1,"Terrible Writing, Boring, & Disturbing","The writing in this book defies every basic rule of decent, quality writing to the point it is distracting (at least for anyone who knows anything about writing). Cliche's are endless, dialogue is terrible, there is so much interior and 'telling' rather than showing it bores the reader to pieces, and the whole first act drags on when probably 75 percent of it could have been cut.What I found most disturbing about this book, however, is the homicidal thoughts toward a simple young boy - for almost no reason. I get it, a prisoner is going mad, but I don't want to read about these disturbing, unnecessary images. Elements of the book are also chauvinistic to its core. I know, it was written some time ago now. Still disgusted by it, though."
5,great book by Auster,"this was the second book I read by Auster and couldn't stop reading it...the plot is very interesting, fun and I noticed the absurdism and existentialismelements which were put in a very good way."
2,Much ado about nothing,"The outline: A lost soul spends the first ten percent of this book driving aimlessly across the US. He meets a young gambler with whom he then is forced into indentured servitude after losing at poker to a pair of rich eccentrics. I won't divulge the entirely predictable ending because there would then be no reason for reading the book. Auster explains and connects nothing, not the genesis of his protaganist's aimlessness, not the scenery or atmosphere of his automotive trip, not the what or why of his imprisonment nor the reason or mechanism by which his friend came to the end that he did. His style is pedantic and his reluctance or inability to conclude any theme bespeaks a writer not long remembered."
5,Nashe and Pozzi have to work for their enemies.,"I found it a very nice book, because I like the kind of writing of Paul Auster. There are things you won't expect and that's why the book is so cool."
1,One of the worst books I've read,"This book steams. It is boring, poorly written, the characterisation is almost non-existent and the underlying metaphor bizarre and barely comprehensible. It sets itself up as some kind of existential fable but more or less fails on all counts.I'd heard Auster was worth a read, but whoever told me that was very wrong. This could have been written by a grade school student. Extremely shallow."
1,Auster is not a writer.,"This book got a snide, lukewarm review in the November 22, 2010 New Yorker magazine and probably deserved it. I looked at a book by Paul Auster once. It was garbage. He is not a writer."
3,cop-out ending,"As always, Auster excells in the innovative premise of the novel--a man who defines freedom as living entirely on the whims of chance. The plot and the language are entirely engrossing, and I read the novel in breathless one day's sitting simply because I couldn't put it down. After all this, Auster deals with the enormity of what he started with a weak whimper of an ending, the most trite, 70s B-movie-like weak bravura conclusion pretending to be a philosophical challenge. The ending is the LEAST interesting instance of the ""chance"" that the protagonist takes."
4,good quality,"really strong product and easy to set up. i would have liked it a bit taller though. the ball tends to bounce over the net sometimes. this is really meant to just save the ball from falling off a cliff or whatever. anyhoo, still does save a few balls from bouncing off our property."
5,WORKED OUT FOR ME,"I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT. LOOKS GOOD, EASY TO SET UP, HARDWARE WAS BETTER QUALITY THAN I EXPECTED. THIS STOPPED MY FOUR TEEN YEAR OLD FROM CHASING THE BALL DOWN THE STREET, WHICH IS THE REASON WE PURCHASED THE PRODUCT, IT LOOKS GREAT AS WELL."
3,Invicta Pro Diver Automatic watch,"This is to an excellent watch. As a matter of fact it likes to run so much, it's difficult to stop the second hand so that the watch can be set to WWV. If it wasn't for this fact, I would rate it as 5 stars. Maybe the watch is defective. Very difficult to set the watch for accurate time."
2,An OK watch,"The watch , which is obviously a knock off of a Rolex Submariner, has a good feel to it, and is nice looking to wear.Don't expect Rolex performance....it gains about a minute a day with my activity pattern. It runs down if you don't wear it for a day or two. Frankly, I'd pay a little more and get a Citizen Eco model...I have one of those which is better quality and keeps perfect time no matter what. I can only give this a ""so, so"" recommendation."
1,Foreign Legion ... Ha.,"What a horrible disappointment this book was. Maurice had visions of an honorable life in the legion, it was not as he expected. I had expectations of a realistic gritty portrayal of life as a legionnaire. Instead what I got was a tale of a perfumed prince, a rich boy, who whines unceasingly through the entire book. He never fires his weapon, he never serves on the front, the farthest he ever has to road-march is 15 miles, and he gets to sleep under a roof most of the time. Still, he complains. At three months he decides to run away. That's right after only three months he decides to split. If you are interested in hearing about a rich boy whine about how mean everyone is to him this is the book for you. I frankly wouldn't use it to wipe my ass, and not just because I read the Kindle version."
3,"Required for class, didn't open it","There were two required textbooks for my technical writing class, and this was the second, cheaper of the two. I am afraid to say this book went totally unused.The information in the book is important, but the internet provides all the information covered in this book as well as being more current."
4,Plantronics Audio45 USB Headphones,"This inexpensive headphone set worked great from the moment of plugin on both Mac and Windows. It has a mic mute and volume control on the wire as well. The sound quality was good. It is thin plastic and time will tell how durable it is, but it was comfortable to wear.Highly recommend"
2,Plantronics USB STEREO HEADSET ( 64603-03 ),"Yes its USB, but you have to use the Plantronics software that you have to download from their site since you are not plugging directly into your soundcard. Their application is horrible and not user friendy. Chatting sounded very tinny and I couldn't get my volume high enough to hear people. The headphones are a little bit better for listening to stereo music then their Audio 60 headset. For the price and inconvenience, this headset isn't worth the money. Buy the non USB Stereo 60!"
1,Worst Phone Ever,"Complete waste of $80. Drops most calls after a few minutes. You can't imagine how frustrating that is to have to call someone back 7 times in an hour.I have tried everything and wasted hours trying to get this phone to work: flashing the firmware, configuring the network settings to static IP, disconnecting/reconnecting the handset, configuring the router to forward all traffic to the phone, etc etc. I even called philips tech support with no luck.Waste of money/time."
3,Philips DECT/VOIP Additional Handset for VOIP841,"Nothing wrong with the phone. It is Skype. I have two phones connected to my computer to work with both my land line and skype. The Vtech is working fine, but Skype will not extend the credit I have in my account to the Philips phone. You try getting hold of Skype and dealing with them. They say they will get in touch with you within twenty four hours, several days ago. I would wait until Skype is a bit more dependable."
1,Philips DECT/VOIP Additional Handset for Skypes,"Philips DECT/VOIP Additional Handset for VOIP841 SeriesHighly disappointed. Equipment - Had to return the original handset for non-performance as it would not communicate with the base unit. Batteries that came along with the handset went dead and started to leak. Unable to communicate clearly using the additional handset. Customer service. Called CS over the weekend, was informed that there are no trained techs over the weekend to help (they claim to have for all other products), experienced a long waiting period, the first two were unable to figure out the problem and help. This individual simply said to return the handset to Amazon and get a replacement. The replacement set has similar issues. Manual does not give clear instructions regarding the use/programming. Tarnish to Philips brand. Would not recommend"
1,couldn't sign in to skype,"I am not quite sure if it was a defective unit, but I spend 3 hours trying to set up this thing. It connected to router but it couldn't sign in to skype. Surprisingly, so many positive reviews and every one saying ""just plug in and it works"". Didn't work for me. I returned the unit and bought netgear sph200d instead and netgear worked. Philips has the best design out of three skype/dect phones currently available, but what's the use if it doesn't work?"
1,Did not work,"I boughtthe Dect/voip Xtra Handset to use with the Philips VOIP8411B/37 Dect/voip Phone System. I was unable to register it with the base, currently I have sent it back to philips lets see what happens. The reason I did not send it back to Amazon or the vendor who sold it in the first place was because they may ed up sending defective phones again and I am not in the mailing business."
4,lookin for a song,"i knwo everyones lookin for songs that werent on the soundtrack, kinda sucks, but i am too. if anyone knows the name of the song that plays when Coach Carter is tlakin to the principal by his car about resiging, after they end the lockout. Its sumthin liek ""you dont know, that i love you....."" if anyones has any idea, let me know, thanks"
1,Where's my song?,"The only reason I bought this CD was for the ""In the Air Tonight"" cover that I heard on the movie trailer, and it's not on the CD. I'm very disappointed. The marketing guy should recieve 30 lashes in the town square at high noon."
3,Name of Song---Please Help!!!!,"Can someone help me get the name of the song that plays when Coach Carter is fired and he's at his trunk and the song that plays has a video to it but I can't remember the artist or the name. I know a part of the verse goes, ""I remember the first time I heard Juicy by by BIG, I was cleanin my the crib with my moms..."" or somethin like that. Can some one help please?"
4,Anthony Hamilton Song,"Hey Bryant that song u are wondering is called, ""Comin From Where I'm From"" by Anthony Hamilton. Another good song that should be on the soundtrack is ""Let the Drummer Kick It"" by Citizen Cope. Hope that helps!"
3,It's missing the main song...,"I would have rated this soundtrack higher, but it's missing the Phil Collins cover ""All My Life"" from the commercial. Does anyone know what band it is?"
5,Looking for a song,"Does anybody out there know of the song title or artist with all the words ending in ""tion"". The song was a slower beat rap song that listed words including educa""tion"", Justica""tion"", relaxa""tion"" and etc.This song is dope.Thanks for the help."
3,does anyone know the name of the song later in the movie,"it goes replication, situation, education, duplication,,,,, it keeps ending with tion....... its pretty slow but good and i cant find it,,, please im me at prfcteclipse99 or my email, or on here,,,thanx alot~Bri"
3,Ying Yang song,Does anyone know that Ying Yang song that they play at the end and at one of their games.
2,The Yin Yang Song,"For the person that asked about that Ying Yang song played at the end and duing one of their games. That's called 'Halftime'. I don't know where it's from, through."
3,"""Tion"" song","The song is Lost Ones by Lauryn Hill. Part of it is ""It's funny how money changes situaTIONS, miscommunication leads to complicaTION... etc."""
3,missing songs,"The song with ""I don't know why I love you"" is called ""Why I Love You"" it's by a rapper named Shells. It would've been a good addition to the soundtrack."
2,Too Much Filler Not Enough Hits,"I bought this soundtrack and it sucks. Why do movie companies use songs in promos that are not in the film? Why do movie companies release soundtracks with suck-ass songs instead of the good ones from the film? Why do movie companies rape us?Does anyone know the name of the song that plays during the dance scene? It's a fast song with lyrics that mention ""WHISTLE""?? I would appreciate some help in finding this song, since I wasted 18 bucks on this crappy soundtrack.Thanks, in advance."
3,SONG FROM THE TRAILER,I saw Everyone asking about the some from the trailer.. its originally by phil collins but Nonpoint is the band singing it in the trailer... the song is called in the air tonight
4,Anybody know?....,I have been looking to buy this album online but I just have one question: is it only an edited CD or is there an explicit one out there? I couldn't imagine that with all of the artists/songs on this soundtrack that they only made an edited version but I have yet to find an explicit one out there. Thanks. --please reply with a message on this site
2,"Title should be some songs from the movie, not the Soundtrack","The movie had more than 30 songs in it. The CD has about one-half that amount and omits many of the best songs. Also, I have searched, played the movie in slow mode and checked out nearly every song listed in the credits but I cannot find the song that plays at the end through the beginning of the credits. No one seems to know. Can someone please tell me what it is and where to find it? It has a whistle in in it and one chorus keeps talking about ""here we come to get you"". Very much appreciate anyone that can demonstrate their genius by telling me the name of the song and/or the artist. Many thanks."
3,help!,does anyone know the name of the song that has the whistles in it that plays at the very end of the movie and at one other point in the movie...i think when they're playing one of their games..??? that song gets me all pumped up and it's not on the soundtrack :-(
3,Extra song?,"I am looking, like many other people for a song that isnt on the album. I think it is the 2nd song into the credits at the end of the film. If ne1 has ne info about this song, please write back"
3,Not that good,I would recommend buying this album for one song........Roll Wit You by Ciara. It's definitly the best track on the album!
1,To Valerie Sama,"I think the song you're thinking of was done by Nonpoint on their CD ""Recoil."" I found the single on MSN music, and it sounds like the version in the commercial.I hate when they do that too! I was gonna buy the soundtrack BECAUSE OF THAT SONG! And it isn't even on there."
2,"Good movie, not the best soundtrack","Is it just me, or were their songs that were missing on the soundtrack? True, a few of em cam eout b4 the movie debuted. For instance, when they were running suicides outside, they placed a track from Ying Yang twins feat. Swizz beats, another is one from N.E.R.D. So the ST could've been atleast 17 tracks."
3,Phil Collins clarification and Coach Carter,"The Phil Collins track is called ""In the Air Tonight"" not ""All My Life"" and is found on the ""Face Value"" album from 1981 or a hits collection. A remix of this is also found on ""Smooth Grooves - Steppin' Out"".The Van Hunt track on Coach Carter is boring also, I expected more after the monster debut album he put out. The R&B; album of 2004, hands down."
1,NEEDS NONPOINT!!!!,"I think it's a huge ripoff when a band's music is used in the trailers and commercials, just to get people to go see the movie. Then they don't get any credit on the soundtrack. Nonpoint is one of the most underrated bands out there, and they deserve the credit to be on this soundtrack.For those of you who don't know, they are the ones who did the Phil Collins cover of ""In the Air Tonight"" the one that goes ""I've been waiting for this moment all my life."" Get their album ""Recoil."" Don't waste money on this soundtrack!"
1,Song from trailor,"The song in the trailor is ""Changes"" by tupac. classic song, should have been on the album."
1,Songs not on the album,"There is a song not on the album, and is by Phil Collins and some band re did it. The song is called 'in the air tonight'. During one of the commercials the song is playing. Why do they play songs for commercials and have it not be on the soundtrack? That does not make sense! And I am with some other people, this is not a good cd at all! Waste of my money!"
2,is this cd edited only?,"ive listened to several different versions of all the song on this album and all of them are edited. I noticed theres no explicit contents sticker on the front, but with the rap artists its really annoying hearing the gaps where they cussing. Does anyone know for sure if theres an explicit version or if it is only available edited?"
4,Good but not stellar...,"This is a good compilation of hip hop music, and it compliments the movie well, but there are a lot of songs in the film missing on the soundtrack that would have made this a 5-star effort. And also, the ""Elation, creation, incarceration, determination..."" song is called ""Let the Drummer Kick"" and it's by Citizen Cope. It definitely should be on the soundtrack it's a great song."
3,some songs not on the cd,Here are a few songs that weren't on the cd..1.Tupac-Changes(its the song that was in the movie trailer)2.Nonpoint-In the air tonight3.Ying Yang Twins-Halftime4.Citizen Cope-Let the drummer kick it(I'm not too sure about this song being in the movie but i'm pretty sure it is)5.Lauryn Hill-Lost Ones
3,For the misguided.....,"Some people apparantly have no appreciation of how movie advertising works.The trailer song is not part of the actual movie soundtrack. Most of the time, when trailers are put out, the film HAS no music yet, so an appropriate piece is put into the trailer.And there is ALWAYS a song list of the back of the CD; I would recommend checking that out before you buy.As the Soundtrack stands, it is a respectable album of appropriate tunes suitable for the urban atmosphere of the film. A good sampler disc for these artists, but true fans will probably own the original albums these songs come from, so for them, there is no use for this CD.Above Average for this particular genre where pop compilations are usually thrown together"
5,Fine death metal,"This is some of the finest brutal death metal that came out of Sweden. While Swano basically abandoned any metal projects he ever had going, his older projects, such as Infestedead, Pan Thy Monium, or the more famous Edge of Sanity is where is at folks. This is brutal, head to hammer relationship. Very evil, raw and Satanic. Good stuff."
5,Very helpful,"I have found the book very helpful in working through my social anxiety, both learning more about how my mind works to cause the anxiety and strategies for accepting the anxiety and working through it rather than fighting it. I haven't looked at any other books on social anxiety so I don't have a full perspective to compare it to other books, but this book has certainly helped me."
4,Useful,"This workbook is well-done and provides basic strategies for working toward recovery from social anxiety. For the reader to see any change for the positive s/he must apply all the techniques and do so repeatedly until the resulting thoughts and behaviors become neural pathways of habit in the brain. Preparation and practice are the keys to recovery from this painful, imprisoning disorder."

3,It's toner.,"You put this in your printer and it can put marks on paper. If you need that kind of thing to happen, buy this. End of story."
4,Best Cartridge for this printer,"At about 23% lower cost per page, this is the HP cartrige of choice."
2,Not great for laptops with built-in bluetooth,"Same as the MX700 but now with bluetooth. I tried this with my Dell Precision M60 hoping to use it without the included bluetooth hub since my laptop already has bluetooth but it just didn't work as good as I'd hoped. When you don't have the hub plugged in, mouse settings can't be changed and are are not remembered from session to session.Some driver tweaks down the line may make this as great as the MX700 but until then no reason to upgrade if you are wanting to use it with built-in bluetooth."
2,Batteries will not stay charged.,"For some reason, the base will not recharge the batteries. It seems that it will only charge if the computer is turned on, and yes, the power cord is plugged in. Since this is on our laptop, it stays off most of the time.Another problem, or concern, is that the bluetooth loading window takes a while to load and sometimes will not load, or lock.In short, this is a crummy wireless mouse. When it actually charges the batteries and loads into windows, it works great and has a good feel.If you want a wireless mouse, get the standard RF mouse.If you need bluetooth, then buy a bluetooth transmiter."
3,Nice quality mouse with some issues,"I have both the MX-500 version and this bluetooth version, which I use primarily with my 12"" bluetooth powerbook. It was easy to set-up for bluetooth, but configuring the buttons beyond Expose on a mac is a pain. 3rd party software, etc. I even had to add a little program to adjust the acceleration and smooth the tracking. And then it would seem to lose the settings periodically. Logitech driver software has been lacking for me, both for PC and mac. So even though the mouse is solid and nice, it is only as good as it's software interface. Since Logitech has yet to write a driver interface for this mouse and OSX, be aware that all buttons in all programs will nit work without some oddball hacking. As for the PC, the Logitech drivers have a tendency to foul up other drivers you already have onboard. All in all the mouse gets 4-5 stars, the software (or lack thereof) gets 2."
4,Combined with the Belkin F8T001 Bluetooth USB adapter,This is precisely the mouse I was looking for to use with my Dell Inspirion XPS laptop.With the adapter I don't even need the USB hub but I do lose the ability to use the button that cycles through open programs without it.Look up the directions for correct driver usage in the customer reviews of the Belkin F8T001.The mouse itself works on any surface I've had it on and doesn't skip around like my Logitech MX1000 Laser.I'm thinking of replacing the MX1000 with another one of these at work. Hope this helps!!!
1,Not for the mac!,"Love Logitech mouses, but this one is not supported for mac, It works but with limited functionality. I thought they would offer drivers to make the right mouse click work etc. But no support arrived!Eventually went to a MX1000 cordless laser mouse, and really love it, super precise, great battery power, everything works."
4,Souped up MX700 adds Bluetooth to your desktop!,"Logitech has done it again! They have been able to design a mouse that meets and exceeds a users needs. Long before the full implementation, Logitech has brought out a whole line-up of products that utilize the Bluetooth wireless technology. There are many advantages to this, which we will cover in this review. Today we will be looking at the MX900 Bluetooth optical mouse which is not set to debut in stores until January 2004! The MX900 looks identical to the MX700, acts in exactly the same way, but utilizes a new wireless technology that allows the users computer to interact with other Bluetooth compatible devices such as cell phones, PDA's, printers, palmtops, microphones and headphones to list a few. (Full review @ bytesector.com)"
1,Too big!,"Yo, this mouse is way too big. It's too heavy too. And, it ruined my marriage. Last night, my wife was like, ""Why is your right hand so much bigger than your left hand?"" She thought I was fiddling with myself a tad too frequently. She continued, ""Am I not enough for you? Was that shopping spree at Victoria's Secret futile?"" I tried to explain to her that my mouse was heavy and that my hand was bigger because I have to exert more energy to move this thing around. Unfortunately, she didn't believe it. Thanks, Logitech! You ruined my marriage. (But, I AM dating her sister!)"
2,Problem with WinXP SP2,"Avoid Logitech products if you have Windows XP Service Pack 2 installed. The Bluetooth stack in SP2 interferes with the Logitech Bluetooth stack, and Logitech responses so far have been far from satisfactory. Many people have complained on Logitech's website, so I would wait until Logitech finds a better solution."
3,It's good but it isn't color...,"I think that colored ink is far preferable to this boring black ink. However, this ink does an excellent job of sticking to the page, and forming words and grayscale graphics."
5,Soulgasm Book Review,"This book reflects the many moods most of us share, but are afraid to express. Ms. Parris brings that to life for us in this wonderful collection of poems. It is truly enjoyable. One of a kind!!!"
5,Papa Jeff,"I was looking for a fun project for my grandsons and I to do. The sundials in this book were very simple up to a moderate ability required. All the projects were fun and allowed me to teach measurements, degrees of angles and researching a project along with the other basics. We found our location in the world and adjusted the clocks to be accurate at our location. We are even going to take the projects to our christmas fair this winter. The boys were very excited to see the results of their laber actually at work. I strongly recomend as a project book and a great learning tool."
3,Good starter book for first time dial maker.,"This book is a well made book physically that gives very detailed descriptions and basic photo and hand drawn examples of the written word. It is as advertised and although it holds several types of dials for several lattitudes what this book is not is a book to teach you how to make any other type of dial , for any other latitudes than listed, than the dials in the book. So, I would not suggest this book as one for a person who is wanting to learn the mathematics of making a very location accurate dial by mathematic construction in wood; this is just not that type of book but, if you already know the mathematics this book could give you some good design and style ideas for a custom wooden dial. Also, the full size dial templates are a real help. In short, this is not a book I would use for reference; just a book to make somewhat accurate wooden dials of types described by the book."
5,Great from the first smell on opening the bag.,"This feed is always fresh. Ella, my cockatiel, loves it. What more can I say? Well, the price beats all the pet shops."
2,Great Color but loses Shape after one wash,"I love the color of this shirt, but after one wash it looks shapeless. The V is quite deep and has to be worn with a cami."
2,Too big!,"I bought this top in a small size, but even though it is still huge! (and I am not precisely a model eh?), by the way, there are no smaller sizes available so I had to give it to my mom!! I didn't like the color either, in my opinion, would be better in mature ladies"
4,Nice comfortable top,Drapes well and very comfortable to wear. Looks nice but I thought it is just a little shapeless.
1,Reads like an English Literature assignment.,From a literary view the book is well written and worth reading. But from a financial investing viewpoint don't expect anything.
3,"Good to know facts, and strategy... But not as interesting","After reading The Montley Fool's Investment Guide, I was expecting a very usefull, and easy to read book. Instead, I got a formula for choosing compannies, and a bunch of examples. (with the rationale behind it).I will find it usefull in my investments. But it was not fun to read."
4,Great book but.......,You'd be Foolish to buy from Amazon.com and here's why: Amazon sells the book at $17.50 plus $3.95 for UPS for a total of $20.95. You can get the same book at shopping.com for $12.50 (+$3.50) or $16.00 total (saving you almost five dollars). Fool On!
4,Required reading for long term investors,"Whether this book will help you improve your investment returns, may be open for debate. there is however no question in my mind, that in this book, the fools establish as good a set of criteria and definitions, for what comprises an emerging or established industry and market leader, as any i've read."
5,An Excellent Approach to Thinking about Investments,"The Rule Breakers/Rule Makers approach to investing shows how to differentiate between the next Microsoft and the next Priceline, and how to capitalize on that knowledge. Wondering whether to take your profits on that start-up and run or hang on for greater glory? Whether to buy that stock that's already way up on the year or look elsewhere? This is the book for you."
2,"Good theoretical concepts, not enough practical application","After reading ""The Foolish Four..."" from the brothers Gardner, I was rather disappointed in the lack of practical application of the theories described in this book."
3,Great theater - Little that is new,"Like the old hippy...the tape rambles on to tell of many tales...most of which, when boiled down, offers little that is new or innovative."
1,Very Disappointing...,I was very disappointed in this book because the first 2 books were actually somewhat helpful. I was expecting this book to be very specific and to the point but I found it to be very vague and it left me feeling very uncertain about my next big move in the market. I would have saved some money and some time if I had just read the New York Times' business section.
1,Systems just don't work,"I started following these authors when I invested in their Dow dog stocks which unfortunately for me have lived up to their names in recent years. These lousy stocks have vastly under performed the broad market averages which the authors say they are supposed to beat... As for the supposed Rule Breakers, sure, with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight who wouldn't like to have bought the great technology stocks at lower prices. These writers have no experience professionally managing money and their experience if you want to call it that writing an online newsletter can be measured in months not decades. Hulbert - who rates newsletters - has ranked their overall stock picks BELOW AVERAGE. One positive - these authors can write and sell themselves but they surely are not the next Warren Buffett or Peter Lynch they'd lead you to believe!"
1,Best investment advice...,The best investment advice I received from buying and reading this books was do not waste anymore money on the Motley Fools books. The trust fund boys do not need your money and they show that by giving the reader nothing for their time and money. This book was a complete waste of time. I read hundreds of books a year and this is the first one that I felt cheated. I am so disappointed with this book that I had to tell all how bad it really was. There was nothing new in this book and the concepts are just a ploy to get you to sign up to their online service. Remember when you get this product home that I told you it was a waste of your time and money so do not come crying to me when you find out the same as I did. Find something else to ready.
3,"Buy, hold and die",The Gardner approach to buying stocks and then holding them till you die is fine is you intend to spend when you are 100 years old. (Or if you intend to earn money from writing books about the same). Anyone young (ie. under 45 years of age) probably prefers to trade.I much prefer Trading Online (FT Pitman 1999) by Patel. Have fun while you're making money.
5,A truly good read. Kept my attention cover to cover.,"Not for the beginning investor, nor one unable to accept the principles that Tom and David explain therein. Follows Foolish idealism and realism. Too, a wonderful read by two exceptionally talented writers."
2,Disappointed,I must say that these refurbished cartridges were useless. I didn't expect them to be as good as the actual Canon manufactured cartridge. I did at least expect them to work. They unfortunately did not function; had to send them back for replacements. Hopefully the replacements work. I'll keep my fingers and toes crossed.
1,TIME FOR A NEW PRINTER,"My Canon printer is about 8 years old,BJC 2100. The cartridge is no longer in any retail store. Can get refurbished on line. In general not worth the problems. Purchased one from Amazon vendor stated ""*SPECIAL PROMOTION!* - NEW Sealed OEM GENUINE Canon BC-20 Ink jet Cartridges from Canon, GUARANTEED Non-Expired. 99% of orders..."" Once I removed the sticker covering the ""do not use after date it read 2006 05"". It was bone dry. Returned to Amazon to get a full refund inc. shipping. Always good to do business with Amazon. Time for a new printer."
3,BC-20 Print Cartridge,"I purchased this product to get more use out of my printer as I couldn't find any in my local stores. The ink cartridge was dry -I couldn't get any ink. Suggestion - should have date of the print cartridge on the website - When you get the box, it says to use within one year. My previous review listed my complaint and the site that send me the cartridge refunded my payment in full. Thank you."
2,Did not work,The seller sent the exact article I asked for but the ink was so old it had dried to the point it would not function. My printer is old and they don't manufacture the ink cartidges any more.
4,Good But It Could Be Better,Good ....Working well but there is 2 more feature if it were available i will Give it the best rating which is :1 - doesn't have built in Answering machine2 - you can't make conference call either between Skype user's or skype & Landline only the conference will work between other handset on th same line :( which is sillyoverall it is Good Machine & It worth what i paid for almost 106$
3,DTMF does not work,"I happily installed this voip box but to my dismay the DTMF does not work right. Sometimes it works, sometimes not. I'm talking about the dial #s you use for menu driven recordings 1-9. Sometimes the tones come out on the other end, sometimes it doesnt. I tried it with my own cellphone. I don't know what is wrong. Can anybody suggest a solution??I read some posts that said SkyeOUT does not xfer the tones thur network instead it is given as a control signal to the other end of Skype node so on the side connecting to your calling party the node is instructed to make the tone. Can someone confirm this? What the heck is happening...DTMF aside, this is a pretty good product otherwise. Highly recommended..."
1,Does not automatically download contacts,"The phone is very easy to setup, but if you have a Skype account it does not download contacts automatically. I called Philips and they confirmed this but some reviews seem to imply that it does. I'm going with Philips as of now!!"
1,Locks Up,"I bought this phone as a gift for our cousins in South Africa. First of all the power supply was not the dual voltage so I had hunt around to find an appropriate power supply to work for 220V supply. It did work for a while and we were able to make some Skype to Skype and Skype Out calls from South Africa. However, the next problem started and it is that the phone hangs up and keeps on displaying ""Retrieving Contacts"" for ever and ever. There is not much one can do other than powering this up and down, unplugging and replugging, but there is no way that this phone can be reliably booted up. I was able to get it back to work but I had no idea what made it work. Now it is on the blink again. There is not much I can do right now since the phone is in South Africa. I think Amazon should be getting back to Philips to resolve these problems or should stop selling Philips products on their website.Philips VOIP841 PC-Free DECT 6.0 Wireless IP Phone"
2,Discontinued and no handsets,"I shop at FRYS in Phoenix, AZ, and this product's handsets have been discontinued for 3 months. I had a choice between this and another Netgear skype phone, I chose the netgear with the additional handsets."
1,Looks nice and that's about it.,"Very nice looking phone but couldn't get it to work. Whenever calls would connect after ringing, the call would stay active but there was no audio. Otherwise, the phone setup and accessed my Skype acocunt fine. 3 calls and a chain of emails with Philips proved useless. They said because this is so new, they don't have support documentation. Their best suggestions were to go a web search, call back and hope to get a technician that knew more, or return to Amazon."
3,Not for those who make video calls,This is a great phone if you are just making calls;However it does not work Live with the skype PC program.WARNING if you use the video function then this phone is not for you...as it does not activate the video function once in a call and vice versa if someone is calling you... the PC is completly oblivious to the incoming video call.I would give it a five otherwise as its neat and simple to set up.
1,No longer works with Skype!!!!!!,"This 'was' a good phone. Skype changed their settings so it no longer works with Skype and you are not able to sign in to your account. The change Skype made does not appear to be isolated to this Philips VOIP841 device. Until Skype does something about this (or Philips updates their firmware), this phone will not work with Skype, so it will not work (since the purpose is to work with Skype). Skype changed settings around 8/16/2011 and apparently made some of the previously Skype Certified phones like this one, obsolete."
5,very good,Good: No PC needed. Dual phone. Supports multiple Skype features. Color screen. Stylish and efficient. Good call quality. Simple to useBad: Fairly expensive.Bottomline: An attractive phone system that will fit in with your home decor and lets you make Skype and traditional landline calls without a computer.I RECOMMENDED
4,This phone has been great!,"I bought this phone several months ago because I have a lot of family in Australia and Skype makes it much cheaper to communicate with them. I didn't want to have to be on my laptop every time I called and I also wanted to be able to receive incoming calls like an ordinary phone.I have been very happy with this product. It looks very stylish and the interface is easy enough to navigate. I keep the base connector box in my basement next to my wireless connection and the phone unit upstairs.The sound quality is excellent too.The only problem I've had with it is occasionally I've had to restart the base unit by power cycling it. That is a little frustrating, but it's not the end of the world. The pros definitely out way that one con.I highly recommend this product to you."
4,Slick little number,"Fantastic reception even at distance, easy to use menus, and extremely easy to set up.Most annoying is the phone book which only uses the Skype phone book. Never really wanted the local pizza joint in my skype phone list.And it takes a few tries to get used to pressing dial twice.Wish it could send a few quick text messages via Skype, but I knew that wasn't available."
3,The Phone is OK; Amazon service is tremendous,"SKPYE Pro is just $3 a month for all the calls you can make. This phone lets you use it without the computer (if you have a wired router). Great. But the first one was defective. Amazon service was fantastic, immediately sending a replacement and a pre-paid return shipping label to send the bad boy back. The 2nd phone works okay. The downside is the small size and small buttons; the sound quality is just okay -- not as good as regular cordless phones - even on the landline. By contrast, SKYPE sound with my computer is nearly perfect. And the phones menu system and operation are a bit quirky. Maybe in the next generation they'll get it right."
4,Excellent Phone,"I am very pleased with this Phone. When it arrived I took it out of the box, plugged it in, entered my Skype username and password and instantly had my all my contacts. The sound quality is very good and the people I call say it sounds perfectly normal on there end. The speaker phone sound is loud and clear. The menu structure is simple and clear and can be learned in all of 2 minutes. The only negative I would mention is that when someone calls who is in your address book, it doesn't always display the name. For me that's not a major problem although it would be nice if it could be corrected. I cannot speak about the landline because I don't have one anymore. This phone has exceeded my expectations and saved my a ton of money. I used to pay $75 a month with the phone company before I even made a call and now I pay $24 a year using Skype. I have heard horror stories about other phones, but this phone is a winner. I highly recommend it."
2,Disapointing,"Philips need to work a lot on it. It is dissapointing, and lack of respect for consumers. The phone continuously doesn't work (shows not available, even when using the land line or trying to shoot the phone off), and Philips didn't answer my questions. I have found simmilar complaints here talking about the software of the phone. To make it work I have to reset frequently the base unit (I now know why they put a reset buton on it!)."
4,headphones,"The head phones and microphone with usb are great in terms of sound quality both ways. They are also comfortable to wear and use. However, the fold up feature for storing or travel is awkward and complicated."
4,Great phone,This is a great phone. It was easy to setup out of the box. I have used Skype in the past and the setup was easy. My wife has never used Skype and she was able to pick up the phone with no issues.The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is I didn't like the fact Philips didn't include instructions to log into the base unit. The usr/pwd were easy enough to find on Google but it would have been really nice if it was include in the docs. I would have also like to see more options in the base unit config pages.Otherwise I love this phone. Range is great and have nothing but good things to say :)
5,Better voice quality then regular phone,"Received the phone 2 weeks ago and it is superb. Voice quality beats all my other phones - sanyos, panasonics on regular line. There is no lag and updated contacts on the computer are seen by the phone almost instanteniously, although speakerphone could have been louder. Easy setup, however you need to go through initial (area code, language) setup and connect transmitter station to your router to start initial charging of the battery - you will see reg/green charging icon moving.Fully recomend, I bought another one for my friend in Canada. Amazons price also chaeper by $30 than Skype. Delivered as said by Amazon"
5,super sound quality,"You will be Happy with this product, it's so easy and I can't tell the difference between land line/internet calls, on sound. Instead of paying 29.00 a month for basic land line and no extras or long distance. I now spend around $7.50 a month with Skype and get all the long distance to US & Canada and caller ID and Caller Block and even more features at no extra charge that's savings of 325 %. Why would anyone want to keep a land line. Three of my neighbors have now switched and are happily saving lots of Money."
3,Sound quality not so good,I expected better sound quality. People I call say I don't sound like myself and that I sound tinnie.Haven't made a desicion to buy additional phones yet.
5,Works as advertised,The phone works completely as advertised without any hiccups. I am currently using it to access both the skype service and my regular land line. The voice quality is on par with any other phone out there and the UI navigation is simple and easy to use. No complaints here.
4,"Good phone, but broke after six months!","I purchased this phone in April. It is now November, and the handset won't communicate with the base unit. It keeps saying that it is unregistered, and it won't let me register the phone. I contacted Phillips, and they are supposed to send a replacement. The phone is discontinued, so I am hoping the replacement is the same phone or similar! It sucks, because I really liked the phone. The only things I didn't like about the phone was each time it was unplugged it would reset to defaults and the battery life would go really low when unplugged. Hopefully, they will come out with something better!!!"
4,Great device,"We bought this phone because we got tired of paying exorbitant rates to speak with friends and family in different countries, and also tired of the calling card game (which is cheap, but painful). We've are happy users of this Skype phone and recommend it unconditionally.The phone is able to use Skype or your regular telephone line. We use Skype for international calls and the local phone monopolies for local and long-distance. International Skype works great (you're paying a couple of cents per minute), but the local and long distance seems to have lower quality, but then it is free.The handset works exactly as you'd expect. It's a telephone with a simple menu. It downloads your Skype contacts and you can decide whether to use skype or your outgoing telephone line when making calls, no surprises. We prefer using the handset to using Skype on the computer(s) in the house because there is less uncertainty about audio quality (e.g. echoes and microphone proximity)."
1,BAD PRODUCT BAD VENDOR,"The phone arrived not working at all but after checking carefully I learned that one battery that came with the phone was dead. After replacing the battery the phone worked for a few hours and then the microphone stopped working. I called the manufacturer who helped me trouble shoot the problem and we determined that there was a manufacturing defect in the phone that caused the mic not to work. I then learned that despite the fact that I purchased the phone new, it did not have a manfacturers warranty, AS ADVERTISED BY THE VENDOR ON AMAZON, since it was discontinued over one year ago! The Vendor, Mini Mino, will reimburse me for the phone but refuses to pay return shipping charges. The vendor, Mini Mino has been rude and decietful ion his dealings with me."
2,Not quite a landline phone,"The phone advertises that you can use it as a landline phone AND a skype phone. While the skype phone functioned as expected, and while you could hook it up to your landline, it does not display the caller id for landline-based calls. I have not heard of a new phone in years that does not display caller id. I emailed the company and called tech support and confirmed that the phone does not display caller id for landline calls."
2,"Works ok, but not great...","I purchased this phone about 3 months ago and have been using it to replace my land line. It works ok for basic phone calls, however, I have found some problems. The first is that DTMF (Touch Tone dialing for phone trees) only works sporadicly. There is also something funny about the mute button that causes the person you called to hear a constant clicking noise that you cannot hear on the voip841. I have also had a problem with the headset jack not working unless I wiggle the plug.Nice looking phone and the sound quality is pretty good, but it has some limitations."
1,Too many lock ups,"Ultimately I found the phone was unreliable, it would lock up and not dial out, and seemed to have a mind of its own, sometimes it would work and sometimes not. I ruled out Skype as a possible cause by testing other methods of accessing Skype. This phone needs another firmware update to address these issues. I returned the phone"
3,Overall pleased,"Very nice, stylish phone. Easy to setup but does need rebooting on occasion, maybe due to conflict with router/modem/computer. Good synch with skype contacts from computer account. Voice quality is very good so overall a good product."
4,Philips VOIP841 review,I've used this phone for a week now and tried it in both Skype mode and Skypeout mode. No complaints so far and the voice clarity is good. No delays in the conversation. The volume of speaker is good.
4,Good Skype Phone!,"Installation was easy. The voice quality is good but not great. When I skyout to international numbers, the voice quality of this phone is better than the voice quality of using calling cards through my cell phone.I've used this phone for about a month. The only minor issues I've are:-I need to reboot the base twice.-It took several hours for new skype contacts, added through the skype client in my computer, to show up in the phone. I'm not sure how to force synchronization immediately."
4,Excellent VOIP product,This product works to perfection. It's easy to set up. It's easy to use. My mother-in-law even knows how to use. It's the best form of free communication out there. I strongly recommend to those who have friends and family located outside the U.S.
4,Nice equipment but not for non-computer related,"I bought the phone as a gift and based my purchase on low cost phone calls and easy or no setup phone installation. But the easy or no setup installation was different...The phone came with a fabric system error in which you can't be heard by the other party, but it can be fix by a product update, for which you require a router, that is not provided and that is for constant use, due to that from time to time you need to reset the phone to be on line every day, and a simple take off the battery doesn't always works. Other than every day setup using a computer that is required to log on the phone for maintenance, which doesn't match with the theme PC free, its a good buy. Came as described in hardware. If you intend to send the phone as a gift where no computer is available or the user is not related to setting up harware for computers, the gift would be a sure return or problem."
3,Great Idea. Execution? Not as Good,"I bought this because of the phone's ability to be used as both a landline and for Skype long distance without hooking up to a computer. The Skype features work great, and the color screen is nice.My only issue is with the headset itself. I like regular phones because they are easy to talk on and the audio quality is superior compared to cell phones. However, this phone is very small and for most people does not fit the face well. It is a lot like talking on an old style large cell phone.The audio quality is very good on both landline and Skype due to the DECT 6.0, which works great because it doesn't have the interference that the 2.4 and 5.8 GHz phones sometimes have.All in all, this is a solid choice for a DECT cordless phone if you are a Skype user. Otherwise, there are better options for you for DECT phones, including Philips itself."
3,Philips Skype Phone,"The phone works fine, but I have one complaint. The center directional pad could be improved; it does NOT scroll your contacts list. Instead, you must keep pressing the button to advance your contact 1-by-1 either upwards or downwards. I also have a Belkin Skype phone which gives you a joystick control. When you press and hold up or down, it ""scrolls"" your contact list. The scrolling speeds up finding your contact immensely. Maybe Philips will read this and issue a software patch to correct the action of their pad."
4,"Pretty good phone. However, charger stopped working","Phone functions very well (as described). Connects without any problem. Unfortunately, the charger no longer works (likely problem with the power cord)."
4,Mostly Great!,"This Skype phone from Philips has been working very well. It allows you to use the Skype service without having your computer online which is a really nice feature. We have noticed a couple of small issues while using the phone but it may be a Skype issue although it's impossible to tell. The phone will occasionally sort of fall asleep and not allow you to call. This can be corrected by turning off the power to it's router allowing it to reset. After doing that it seems to work fine. The phone itself is easy on batteries, has a great speaker for both regular conversation as well as on speakerphone, and is compact without being too small. Overall, I am extremely pleased with the phone and with the Skype service."
4,Great Landline Replacement,"Works as expected, call quality consistent on Skype and in my opinion better than most landlines. At $3 a month for unlimited calling with the US and Canada and super cheap rates for calls abroad you can't go wrong with this setup. I can't speak for its landline quality as I only use it on Skype. Looks great too and usually draws attention from guests. Only problem is that it occasionally will have problems logging in, but a hard reset solves the problem and perhaps there has been a software update (it is set to auto update so I am not sure if or when it has) since I have not had the problem for about a month."
4,Does what it's supposed to,"I don't have much to say. It's done everything I expected it to do. Battery life is short when you're used the world of mobile phones, but I knew this going in. Also, it doesn't have a handset volume control that I know of, which is frustrating from time to time (I haven't read the directions yet though). Overall it is a much nicer experience than being tethered to my computer. It is at least as stable as my desktop (wired network connection) and my laptop (WiFi); in fact, I think I have had better call quality. No complaints for the price. Also, I don't use it for land line service."
2,"Poor characteristics/manual, difficult debugging","I found this product quite poor. The web interface is minimal with no features to help the user debug the connectivity (e.g. not even a typical ping command). Not very user-friendly at all: If it fails to sign-in to Skype you don't really know what is wrong. You only get a failure message. Some features require the device to be singed-in to Skype. For example, you cannot see the list of previous calls unless you're signed in. The manual is VERY VERY bad. It does not even contain information to help the user configure the device for operation behind firewalls. In general, it does the job but I wouldn't buy it again nor would I recommend it to anyone."
1,Better a cellphone with wifi,"I tried one. The base works but the handset keeps disconnecting from the base and the connection for the a land line does not work. I'd better buy a cellphone with wifi and install skype: Same price, better service."
2,Somewhat useful VOIP phone,This device has worked reasonably well in the various countries where I have lived since purchasing it some years ago.
4,great phone!,"This thing is soooo easy to setup.The only downside so far is that I don't think it has speed-dial, which would be very nice considering skype cannot call 911.... very nice phone, good quality, works well."
5,affordable small business solution,"The Philips VOIP phone has surpassed all my expectations. I run a small business so I bought one for my office. We use skype out for free outgoing calls ($3 a month) and skype in to give us an incoming number ($2 monthly). Unfortunately our toll free number still has to be forwarded by AT&T, hopefully soon that Skype will allow us to do it all through them. Now we can provide customer service on 2 lines, using the computer primarily and the phone as a second line. I never thought VOIP would be as reliable as it is, especially after hearing about pains of people using vonage, but with so much less hardware and only $5 monthly this is a much better solution."
2,Not a bad phone but i wouldn't call it good either,"Been using this phone for 6 months now and i have to say i'm a bit disappointed in its performance. All-in-all the build of the phone was very sturdy, the quality of the calls were decent and setup was a breeze but the signal was just awful for my house. I live in a 2 story brick and mortar house and the signal just wasn't powerful enough when i chose to bring the phone downstairs (the base is located on the 2nd floor). I also have to say that the batteries drained far faster compared to my old wireless phones. It also had an annoying tendency to display ""System is starting up"" once in a while and this wouldn't go away until you removed the batteries and restarted the unit. Firmware upgrade anyone?"
4,minor problems,Phone itself works great. When you try to add a second or third satellite they won't register with the base. You have to hold the page button on the base for a few seconds while trying to register the other phones. It took some playing around to find this out. It isn't written anywhere in the instructions.
4,GOOD PRODUCT BUT...,Good product but I thought it was going to be like the BELKIN WI-FI telephone that could be Connected to any secured or open access WiFi network. It is just to use at your office or home. You cannot take it anywhere else
4,Great dual skype and landline phone,"I have two of these phones, and the work great. The only thing that kept me from giving them 5 stars is that both broke within months of purchase. Philips were great at replacing them, and the second two are doing well.The phone is easy to operate, the sound quality is good, and I have never had a bad connection, I think because the base station has a wired connection to my network. I have tried WiFi skype phones and have been constantly disappointed. Very easy to select land line or Skype. Good ""phone book"". All round a good product."
3,philips voip841,"The only annoying part is that sometimes it freezes trying to start the system. You have to unplug the whole thing in order to make it work again. For everything else, I think it's okay.A veces se queda trabado tratando de arrancar el sistema. Tienes que desconectarlo para que funcione. Por lo demás, pienso que está bien."
3,Needs a firmware update,"Gets stuck sometimes and needs it's power cycled on and off. The frustrating thing is that it happens randomly maybe every few days now. So if I don't get a call in a while, I look to see if it's stuck (""Looking for service"" is displayed on the handset). Its a nice phone and sounds and functions great, but it has a problem. I'm still looking for a fix."
5,Excellent phone & reception,"All's been well with my Philips VOIP841 since it arrived a month ago.Updating firmware was an automated operation that the phone took care of (though it took a few hours which made me a bit worried--maybe it got stuck or something).Signal on Skype has been crystal clear (clearer than I've experienced on the computer based software Skype). And the landline reception on the phone has been clear too.User interface is simple and easy to learnI love the user-replacable AAA rechargeable batteriesHands-free operation with a plug in adaptor works wonderfully too.Overall, I have had absolutely nothing to complain about--it's the best phone I've had. Oh yea, and I give 5 stars to the sounds this phone makes--worlds better than the underwater sounds that software Skype makes :-)."
3,Fine Skype Phone/ Lousy Land Line,"The phone is fine... good weight, fairly easy to use, although there are some annoying extra steps that you have to take, but overall it is pretty useable. The Skype functionality is great. No real complaints with that. As a land line though, it sucks. There is an annoying echo. And for the price - it really should not have had that problem. In the end, I found that I liked the camera feature on my computer and decided that a hard wired phone was more useful to me than the cordless."
4,So far so good......,I bought this phone after a lot of research and I think I made a good decision. Settting up the phone is very easy and the call quality is also good. A couple of people complained that there was some noise when I called them but that was 2 out of 100 calls that I made so I wouldn't really worry about it especially when I am saving a bunch of money on my phone bill. Also you cannot switch between Skype call and regular landline call but that is not a problem for me since I don't have a landline. I bought skype pro and skype in number for about $60 a year and that is all I pay for a year of unlimited local and long distance calling and even others can call me to my skype in number. Overall I am very satisfied with it for the last month that I had this phone.
4,Good phone,"I purchased this phone last month. Its not given me any problems so far. GUI is a bit sluggish and keys are hard to press, but it works well, overall. Clarity of speakerphone is pretty good. Use rechargeables for better talk time. Highly recommended"
2,"Too slow, sub-par phone quality","The phone processor is too slow and sometimes it takes some wait to do anything. Also its land line quality is no better than average, and skype sounds better on the computer than this phone."
4,It does a fair job,"When I got this phone, there was not much to chose from. I was primarily interested in it's Skype capability which has worked well. The interface is somewhat cumbersome and it could use some improvement but it performs fairly well overall. There was some issues setting it up through my Linksys router so I had to use a hub and prevent the router from getting crammed with traffic when the phone was in use. If you're a hardcore Skype user, you might want to consider other alternatives but if you only plan to use it now and then, this phone is a sensible choice."
1,It can be defective,"I bought two Philips VOIP841 PC-Free phones a few years ago. One has worked perfectly and it is amazing the other worked for about a year and suddenly started displaying a message ""THE SYSTEM IS STARTING UP"". This message has stayed their for almost two years and I still have found no solution. Please google Philips VOIP841 The system is starting up and you will see many blogs from people like me that can't seem to find a solution. I hope this review gets to somebody at Philips who can address the issue and solve the problem.With regards to buying or not buying, it is a risk game, red or black, pair or impair .... if you are lucky and it works you will enjoy the phone."
1,Too bad it is poorly made,"The phone is actually a good phone and rarely requires a reboot, which is a real challenge for a Skype phone. But the handset quickly start to show electric issues. To the point where it does not charge any more, or when it charges, kills any kind of rechargeable batteries in a day. After 8 months this phone was totally unusable. Too bad was not a cheap phone."
3,SKYPE calls usually can't use touch-tone to respond to automated answering systems,This is a great land-line phone. As a Skype phone its not bad but certainly not perfect. When using SKYPE the phone is often incapable of producing touch-tone (DTMF) after the caller has answered. This makes keying in an account number or selecting an option impossible. Beyond this difficulty the phone works well.
5,Perfect!,"Great phone great quality great range! works marvelous even with a slow dsl broadband service, great if you use skype a lot and very flexible for saving on your long distance phone bill if you buy it you love the ability to use you land line and then save a bundle with skypes great long distance rates and if you travel abroad allot its small enough to take with you and use wherever you go! call quality depends on your internet speed. but in general its been great no drops in calls in my experience."
4,Works really well,"Works very well, as published. But the screen size is very tiny - could have been bigger and had more features to synchronize contacts."
3,good except some locks up!!!,"I'm not sure maybe it is a Skype problem and Philips has nothing to do with it, but it sometimes locks up and you do not know if it is online or not. So we lost many calls since it was disconnected from modem!!!"
1,The phone died on me.,Bought this unit for my parents in India and less than 1 week and the handset died. It doesnt display or ring. Now I have to figure if there is a service center in India !
2,Skype phone,"I was expecting more from this phone for less. It ended up an expensive purchase for a so so service... to call someone I actually need to try several times until it gets the call through... Even the actual box skype put a notice saying that this is not a replacement for a regular phone then I guess it's my mistake to think that a vOIP phone costing over $100 could be as good as a ""real one"". The good side if you can establish a call the sound is clear and no interruptions."
2,skype phone,"this phone only works when you call out; sometimes when a person has had an old cordless phone calls, there is an annoying echo; and the phone only rings once. It is great to use after my computer is shut down; I can still use skype; it needs to have a better system for audio; the volume is not loud at all and if there is echoing, forget hearing anything; the worst is that I bought it and opened the package; the buyer would not take it back because I thought it was defective; I would have to send a brand new phone to the manufacturer instead of getting a refund for a not so good product. very disappointed in both product and the seller. Now I am stuck with an expensive phone that works some of the time."
4,Very good phone,"I bought this phone to use SkypeOut without having to use a computer. After about a months use, I am very satisfied with the phone and Skyeout Service.If you use Vonage or another VoIP provider, Skypeout will save you approximately $22 per month, this savings will pay for this phone in about 6 months. The quality is comparable to VoIP.Pros- Excellent design- Interfaces with Skype without a computer- Redial History is pretty long- Works with a normal phone line as well (dual line).Cons- Range is a little less than other phones. I have my base in thebasement. When I go to the second floor, the quality deteriorates slightly. This could be because of the new 1.8GHz that Cordless phones are using.Over all an excellent phone!"
1,"Very hard to use with Skype, drops calls","With so many rave reviews, you'd think it's easy to use this phone, and you'd get your bang for the buck. But you just don't.This phone makes it super hard to even see your contacts from Skype. You have to enter ALL of them, one by one, all over again. Very un-userfriendly. Once you manage to have entered everyone, and you pray it's correct, you make a call. First 3-4 calls were OK, even though echo cancelation wasn't the best out there (see my review of the IPEVO FREE1 USB PHONE). And then it started dropping calls. As in 80% of calls.Verdict: not good for Skype."
1,Returned as defective,Returned this product to Amazon because the handset could never find the base. Tried working out the issue with Philips and on the Skype boards but in the end the handset never worked. Looks great and I wish I could have used it instead of the older version I now have
2,Died in one year!,"I purchased a new Phillips VOIP841C phone. Came with 1 phone and it's modem.The phone worked great for about 1 year. Now, it drags down my internet speeds and will drop the caller's voice. They can hear me, but I cannot hear them, yet the connection is still present.Restart the router and the Phillips Skype Modem and phone. I've rechecked all connections to cable modem, skype modem, router. Still have this issue.Without skype modem connected to my router, I get download speeds of 13MB to 17MB. With this modem connected, I get download speeds of 350kb.Testing with Pcpitstop, during the download test, 350kb seen, and while test is still running, unplug power to skype modem, download speeds increased to 13MB!This did not happen when I first bought 1 year ago, and continued usage for that year. It worked great for that first year."
3,what the heck is up with the price??,Both this phone and the similar Linksys 400 have quadrupled in price in the last month (~$100ish to >$400)?? what the heck is going on? does anyone know if they have been discontinued or something?
1,Okay,I got this product very quick after I ordered it but it was not the size as said in the profile and also was not the same print pictured in the photograph in the selling profile as listed. It was a different color arrangement which was the entire reason I purchased the item to begin with. Disappointed.
2,too big,"I ordered this for my 7 yo and 9yo boys. It is even big for me. So if you are going to get this for kids same age as my kids, think again. It may be too big for them."
4,Mysterious,"Simply put, if you like King, Saul, etc, you will love this book. Mystery, suspense, and interesting characters."
3,Fun but disappointing,"A treasure hunt with a discovery twist is what the book seems to hint at what it will be. However, it is more of a treasure hunt than anything. It reads like a movie with a very typical end. Not 10 pages into it I knew how it would end. Its fun, fast to read, but often gets bogged down with useless subplots that do not advacne the plot at all. I would say more, but I don't want to ruin the book for anyone."
4,Suprisingly good (non Pendergast) story,"This story was facinating simply because something very much like it has happened in real life. I refer to Oak Island off the coast of Nova Scotia. If you aren't familar with the story google it, it is a compelling tale of treasure hunting, craziness and death that began in the 1700s. This story has many of the same elements; showing human nature at its worst (and sometimes best). I love the Pendergast books so much that I wasn't sure about this one, but it suprised me."
4,Solving the mystery of Oak Island,"This is a novel that is based on the real-life unsolved mystery of Oak Island's Money Pit. I thought the book had a realistic account of what it would take to penetrate the mystery of the Money Pit. The story was entertaining and kept me turning pages. The only negative comment I would make is that Neidelman, the treasure salvor, apparently has never heard of OSHA or workplace safety concepts, and this made him less credible as a character. (I often found myself wondering how the ESS from ICE LIMIT would have handled this task.) Overall, though, this was a very engaging read and a great way to pass an afternoon."
4,"Classic Premise, Masterful Execution","The plot is well-conceived and fast-paced, the characters hold your attention, and the action will keep you reading well into the night. If you think having a big, made-for-Hollywood-style story means you have to settle for shoddy writing -- think again. Though their work is meant to be sold to a mass audience, Preston and Child are still master craftsmen whose attention to detail never flags. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and can't wait for their next one!"
5,Another great read from Child and Preston,"I never cease to be enjoyed by these authors stories. The only problem with this book is its length. It could have used an extra 50 or so pages to further develop the characters...but it was impossible to put down. Mal Hatch didn't seenm the type to stand up to a crazed bunch of treasure hunters, but the ending, especially the visuals of the channel crossing in hurricane conditions, is classic for these authors. It didn't disappoint and is well worth the few hours it will take to finish."
5,Preston & Lincoln at their Best!,"After reading the first paragraph, I couldn't put this book down. I finished the entire book in one night. Before I knew it, the sun was up, and it was time to go to work. Don't open this book unless you have twelve hours to read it straight through because you won't want to put it down."
5,Never put this one down!!,"This is the essence of a page turner almosty from page one the lives , the horror and the final twisting magnificence of the writing is the modis apporondy of this great pair of storytellers"
4,Classic Preston and Child!,I found this one to be very interesting with a twist at the end that definitely had me in suspense. Small town refuge returns to settle an old family issue. Gets tied up with greedy fortune hunters --- proves to be a mind catching scenario. I enjoy the general style that Preston and Child have throughout their books - and Riptide is an excellent example of their work.
3,Riptide was OK. Three stars.,"Riptide was OK, but not the page turner I thought it would be. The mystery of the treasure and the puzzle of the waterpit is what I found interesting, but the reunion the protagonist has with the people he grew up with was boring. The book should have had illustrations of the waterpit. I had to go to the author's website to see what it looks like at[...]"
3,Should have been better,"Ok, I admit it, I'm a sucker for cheap adventures. Can't help it, I just am.This book should have been great. Pirates, water, traps, treasure - all the right pieces, but it can be so difficult to properly balance these pieces.Preston and Child made it 3/4 through the book before their pieces toppled.The first three quarters are great. Exciting, entertaining, they'll keep you glued.The book falls in the end, though, as characters seem to change too drastically, and much of what has been set up topples in the wind.Would I recommend this? Absolutely. It will be a let down, and sometimes that's worse than a book that's terrible from the start, but the bulk of this book is the duo at the top of their game, and it's worth purchasing for that alone."
4,Note to Indiana Jones & The Goonies: Move Over!,"Fun, fun, fun! I have not enjoyed a story so much in such a long time! Child & Preston have done it again and I'm anxiously looking forward to their next novel...If you are a fan of adventure novels with a great historical setting and beleivable characters, look no further. The authors work so well together as a team and have an uncanny nitch for developing the most original ideas and snappy dialogue. I highly recommend this as a fun summer read!"
3,A fast book to read,"The book will keep you reading but many times it goes out of the main story and that makes a little bit boring the story, the story of the lost sword is good, but at the end I think that the writers just wanted to end the book and say that the sword was made from alien materials. It's not the best book but if you start this book you will end it because taking out the boring parts, the story of the island and the pirates will keep you interested, and is a really easy and fast book to read."
5,"For real adventure, read this.","Both Preston and Child blow me away with both the use of science and the fast-paced and exciting plotting in this book. Perhaps my favorite of all of their books, Riptide is definately an outstanding read, and well-written to boot.I, like another reviewer who previously exhalted the book, cannot wait for the movie!"
5,Another treasure from Child & Preston !,"To my mind they have done it again,right up there with Relic and Reliquary. This time there's no deep dark jungle, it's pirates and buried treasure and curses on all the greedy seekers. What could be better for a summer's read ! The scene is the coast of Maine,but the legend is pure Oak Island,Nova Scotia. Well Done Indeed !!!"
5,One outstanding read. Couldn't put it down.,"I loved this book from beginning to end. Lots of action, good details (but not too much of them) and a genuine good yarn. I've already bought 3 more copies to give as gifts. Strongly recommended."
5,Riptide is riproaring pirate treasure ride,"After reading Relic, Reliquary, and Mt.Dragon by Douglas and Child I was eager to see where they could take their talents next. And Riptide will not disappoint. The story takes place off the coast of Maine and for centuries treasure seekers have tried to recover the fabled treasure of Red Ned the Pirate. But all have failed until a secret code is discovered and a modern computer must match wits with 17th century cryptography and the computer does not fare well. It takes human ingenuity to prevail. Action and Suspense galore in this entertaining tale."
3,"Good, but overated","Don't be deceived by the synopsis and reviews of this book. It's a good book, but it's not great. It's a little light on the ""thriller"" scale. There are no monsters or evil spirits in this book to ""juice"" things up a bit. If you're interested in a book that is high on the ""thriller"" scale, read the Relic and Reliquary. ""Phantoms"" by Dean Koontz is also high on my list. This book deserves no more than three stars."
5,100% Fun!,"I've read other books by Child/Preston (Relic and Reliquary) and found them fun but the writing just a little rough.But Riptide, now--Wow! They have really hit their stride on this one. The pacing is great and the thought they put into how to approach the diabolically clever puzzle of the treasure pit is impressive.I thoroughly enjoyed this book right to the end, even sneaking out to sit in my car at work to finish it!In the first few pages of the book, we are introduced to the main character, Malin Hatch, as a boy, and see the gruesome tragedy that shadows the rest of his life, but that will not be fully explained until the end of the book. Then we skip forward 30 years. Ladies and gentlemen, THAT's what I call a ""hook!"" I was certainly hooked until the very end.I'm certain you will enjoy this roller coaster ride of a book."
3,Did we read the same book?,"The five-star reviews here certainly don't reflect my experience with Riptide. The dialog was awful, the undeveloped characters where clichéd and the story mundane. There were a couple of interesting aspects to the Pit that kept this from being a total waste. There were no real surprises and I never cared if the characters lived or died. I enjoy fun, escapist adventure novels, this just wasn't one of them."
4,Shiver Me Timbers!,"Another rollicking, nail-biting, edge of your seat suspense from the writing duo of Preston and Child. Treasure left by pirates has been buried on Ragged Island; an island owned by Dr. Malin Hatch. Ragged Island is the scene of death and destruction for many of Dr. Malin's family.Dr. Hatch is approached by modern day fortune hunters to employ modern technology to locate the treasure estimated at 2 billion dollars. Dr. Hatch agrees and the hunt is on.The story surrounding the hunt for the pirate treasure is replete with violence, suspense, great riches and even greater evil. This is a wonderful book for those who enjoy history and suspense and some rousing good fun."
4,Impressive adventure thriller,"I read quite a few books like this and most I become dissatisfied with half-way through, as the plot becomes more outrageous and the explosions more frequent. This one kept me involved (and not annoyed) from beginning to end."
5,excellent thriller,"I have read Preston and Child books since discovering them last year. All the books are great and thrilling. I was a little concerned because many of the ones I'd happened to read all involved monsters that emitted strange scents. I'd begun to wonder if the duo was stuck in a rut. Well, I didn't have to worry, because Riptide is a whole different ballgame, yet equally as thrilling. The reader is hooked into the storyline on the first page, because yes, of course we all want to know what happens to Malin's brother. And yet, we are not bored with the convoluted way the author takes us to that answer. Kudos to Preston and Child for producing yet another excellent thriller."
4,Pirates and Lost Treasure,"A thouroughly enjoyable adventure and a very good read. The authors are successful in captivating the readers in the characters, the setting and the hunt for the treasure"
3,Good but not great,"I enjoyed the premise of this book, and it has a great ending, but I felt it suffered from two flaws, both of which should have been addressed by Preston & Child's editor. First, this book is wordy. For example, we are repeatedly told about Malin Hatch's childhood and about the dangers in the Pit. Once is enough. Secondly, the female characters have no depth. I had no understanding of or connection to any of the women, including Isobel Bonterre, who obviously is a main character since she and Hatch leave together at the end of the book. The characterization of the men, on the other hand, was very good, especially the storekeeper, Bud Rowell, and the preacher, Woody Clay. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read adventure stories, but this is not one that will hold the attention of an unwilling reader, and I wouldn't recommend it to a woman without first discussing the characterization of women."
3,"Not up to ""The Relic"" or ""Reliquary"" standards","I wasn't an impressed with this book as other reviewers have been. It was entertaining enough, but I guess I just expected more out of these guys after having read ""The Relic"", ""Reliquary"", and ""Mount Dragon"" -- all 5-star books, in my opinion. I fear Preston and Child are starting to go the way of other authors (notably, Grisham) and are writing with the thought of making a movie, rather than the thought of making a good READ."
2,Disappointing,"I have read almost all of the Pendergast novels and really liked them. I purchased this book mainly based on the reviews on Amazon and because I like the authors others works. However, I must say this book was pretty boring. The first chapter hooks you, but then not much exciting happens for the next 300 pages or so. Once I got to the climax of the book it got a little more exciting but still I was pretty disappointed. I'll keep reading Preston/Child and look forward to their new works, but I cannot recommend this one as an exciting adventure/thriller."
2,Bring Back Pendergast!,"I seem to be in the minority here, but I didn't like it! I absolutely loved Relic and Reliquary, but this book completely lost my interest. I didn't like any of the characters, there was no spark that I could see between the two love interests, and the story just wasn't what I expected. I'm eagerly awaiting the new book in July and even more so the next one in which Pendergast is supposed to come back. At least that's what I'm told!"
2,WATER PIT - WHO CARES!?!?!?,"I've read all of Preston and Childs books and I have to say this was the least interesting. Characters were hard to like, the dangers with the water pit, boring. The book's set up took to long, I only finished it because I wanted to know what happened and frankly when I did ... I didn't care. Not one of their best."
2,Hardy Boys Mysteries for Adults,"I was humming the tv show theme the whole time. If you enjoy GI Joe book and records, or Hardy/Nancy Drew books, grab this book. It's got PIRATES ""Arrrg!"", TREASURE ""Oooh"", BOOBYTRAPS ""Yikes!"" But man, it let's you down. Great setup, and the the whole damn souffle falls flat."
1,I give up . . .,"Sorry to say I'm giving up on reading Riptide. I slogged about halfway through, begrudgingly, over a couple months. The story's premise is good: a mysterious island where people have disappeared or been killed and the promise of hidden treasure. And I've read a lot of Preston-Child novels, but Riptide just isn't holding my interest. The pace seems incredibly slow and the characters just so-so. No one stands out as someone to root for. To this point there's no romance to speak of and not a lot of action. I gave the book one star because I had to rate it. Sorry, guys. This one goes into the donation box. Glad I picked up the hardcover at resale . . . Sharon"
3,Should of been better,"This is the fourth Lincoln Preston novel I've read, and althought it was a good story, I found it somewhat lacking of their other novels."
1,what's with all the good reviews,Seen Jurassic Park. Done DaVinci Code. This book steals from both. Complete with big storm. Nerd who gets killed. A Monster in the form of a pit instead of a Raptor. History lessons to keep us intrigued.... Do we really need to read this rehash? Better to weed the garden. This genre has run its course. Total waste of time....very skimmable and without any merit.
4,A ripping yarn!,"A thrilling, old-fashioned mystery with suitable assortment of characters (troubled & emotionally scarred heroes, female figures hovering on the borders of love-interest and important characters, treasure, history & legends, a momomaniac villain, others esp. from the heroe's past), interesting themes (a rather pseudo-scientific mystery at the core, and several major & minor adventures), and an open ending! Recommended for a fresh reading."
4,Entertaining/Fun read - not life changing!,"I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a simple, entertaining, adventurous read. While I would not rate this book as one of the 'best ever', I did enjoy it. The story is based, somewhat, on the Legend of Oak Island and the infamous Money Pit and the fact that we would finally find out what was at the bottom of that pit, at least fictionally speaking. There was a good mix of characters, although they lacked depth, a good mix of adventure, mystery, and action. I would have rated the book higher if the ending was not so anticlamitic. I had hoped that everything was leading to a big WOW for and ending, but instead all I got was an Oh!?! The ending was not what I had expected for a Child/Preston book. With that said, I would still encourage everyone who enjoys the action/adventure style of writting to check this book out."
4,An excellent thriller,"Once again, Preston and Child have written a novel which will keep the reader enthralled for several hours. The authors keep the reader on the edge of his/her seat from the beginning of the book until the end.The authors evidently do quite a bit of research for their novels. Their description of the Water Pit and its various pitfalls is incredible. The only downside to the novel is its big buildup to the discovery of what lies in the Pit and what happens when the discovery is made. Due to the immense buildup, the eventual discovery is a slight disappointment. Some readers will probably decipher the mystery before it's revealed.Other than that, this novel is a very entertaining and fun read. The authors of ""The Relic"" have written another outstanding novel."
3,a dissapointment,"don't get me wrong, i'm not saying it was a bad book, but i know what these two are capable of writing, and they can do better than this. the idea behind the story is overdone and wasn't all that interesting to begin with. the characters aren't as dynamic as they usually are in their books, but i didi like the water pit."
3,Disappointing,I have thoroughly enjoyed everything that these guys have written together. I have read 5 of their books so far. I was quite surprised to find this one at times difficult to get through although the last one-hundred pages helped me from rating it lower. Unlike the past novels I've read I find the characters to be somewhat out of whack. The lead woman character seems to be completely out of place and seperate from the rest of the story. Unlike previous novels I found that there were delaying tactics that kept the reader from getting to the meat of the story too soon. I have every bit of confidence that I will enjoy the yet to be determined next novel by these great story tellers. This one though just didn't cut it.
4,"Smart, sexy pirate yarn","Riptide's pace, clever plot twists, and well developed, likable characters are why we get hooked on Preston & Child. Good psychology, nail biting tension, and bone bending action are combined in a fast paced battle between good and evil.Give me more."
5,The most captivating book I have read recently,"From the very beginning to the last page, Preston held my attention and interest. The plot and characters of Riptide come alive with action, energy and suspense. I wanted to read more after the story ended."
4,Treasure hunting fun,"A great book from start to finish, it brought to mind Oak Island, and Blackbeard's treasure... although Red Ned's treasure is more viciously defended. Though it seems supernatural at the beginning, Man is revealed as the ultimate architect of doom.. especially a man who has nothing left to lose. Adventure, excitement.. a contrived romance (forgivable), and a relentlessly thrilling third act make this an enjoyable read."
4,Unique shape,"Wife loved it, only drawback is she wanted a band to go with it and due to the raised flat sides it has been hard to find one."
1,Disappointing,"I bought this some time ago expecting an erotic exploration of many varied ... fetish themes, particularly those pertaining to rubber and PVC apparel. Disappointingly, I found the collection of images boring and monotonous, with very few exceptions. Mind you, some may really like this book.As art, it is only marginally succesful.As an erotic art collection, it is inconsistentAs erotica it is flacid.Inspect this book before purchasing."
1,BORING!!!!,Sorry. I did not find this book stimulating. I did not find it clever. I did not find it sexy. I was very disappointed.
1,"Tiny book, check the dimensions",This book is so small you would feel ripped off paying a dollar for it in a charity store. Pictures are alright but you might need a magnifying glass to see them.
5,ABSOLUTELY AWESOME AND THOROUGH!,"I've owned this book since 1994 and I absolutely consider it to be the very best out of all the over 100 great books on mail-order that I've owned! I've profitted mightily, from it! It's a huge (and heavy!) book, and it's worth its weight (many times over!) in gold! If anyone wants to make it (and make it big!) in this business, he/she'd better get hold of this book -- at whatever cost he/she may have to pay! Invaluable! Our hats off to Ben, King of Mail-orderdom!"
3,Don't try to sample it here.,"Amazon has obviously got the wrong music playing as samples for this album, it's some kind of new age chanting chick. Kinda funny if you think about it.Late"
2,Avoid for sensitive children,"I personally loved this book and story and thought my 4 year old could handle the plot. She loves whales and mama/baby animal stories so I was hopeful.It was a complete disaster. She was so worried about the daddy whale disappearing and about the mama whale fighting, etc. She was sobbing uncontrollably, and then I was too. It was just awful.This is a girl who has never cried about any book before, and we read a ton of them of a huge range of topics.So, just a warning if you have a sensitive youngster!"
4,"Raw,noisy,scratchy......and loving it!","Now we all know that music critics are a bunch of impotent wankers. And anybody that complains about the recording quality of a punk band just doesn't get it. Seminal is raunchy live Fall. Just like they allways sounded live. This is one of my top three favorite Fall albums. Witch Trials and Early Fall are put together better, but this is still some great music. If you want perfection, go buy a Rush album and take a nap!"
3,Not their best,"The live tracks are abysmal. The band was not exactly hot stuff after Karl Burns had left, and they give sloppy and lifeless performances of what had been some good songs. The exception is ""Curious Orange"" which sounded better live than in studio.But the studio material is pretty classic in my opinion. Especially the ""Pinball Machine"" cover. So it turns out this must be heard by Fall fans."
1,A good mind does not a good record make,"I bought this when it first came out. Never have I been so appalled in my life. Close to the worst Fall album if you disregard most of the more recent material. 'Extricate' may have made up for this toxic detritus, but barely. 'Contractual abortion obligation' is right. All the good songs are on other records. All the 'new' material isn't worth it unless you're a completist.If you're a Fall fan who can't live without Brix, try 'I Am Kurious Oranj,' 'This Nation's Saving Grace,' or 'Wonderful and Frightening World of The Fall'."
2,helmet,"product quality was good. however, the suspension set-up for fit around the head was extremely uncomfortable. helmet was returned to supplier!"
1,Straps put too much pressure on my head,"While the helmet itself fits fine, it's the straps inside the helmet that are too tight and put too much pressure on my head especially near temples. The material the straps are made from is not soft at all. The pain from straps' pressure wouldn't go away after 15 minutes but only increases.I called the customer service. They told me that this model is discontinued and suggested to try the new one.The price for this one was good. But I guess you get what you pay for. I will have to return it. Should've made flexible/adjustible straps and should've used softer material."
4,"Cheap, but it does the job!","It arrived sooner than it was predicted and I'm using it for the last month. I could adjust for my head and my husband's since the size is Medium/Large, using the extra foam that came together with the helmet. I have to confess that the appearance is a little bit ""cheap"" despite the fact that it has ""2 stars"" (of 3 maximum) related to security and comfort. I hope never need it in an accident but the price totally worth it!"
4,Bike Helmet,"Won't know until I really need it, wearing it is fine, but it feels as if landing on it could still be painful as it doesn't quite catch the contour of my skull... May just be the shape of mine though. Airy and non restrictive which is good."
4,Good basic bike helmet,"I bought this helmet for my son. It adjusts easily and looks good. The visor does not secure very well to the helmet, but a little glue would solve the problem if you really want it on the helmet. Very good helmet for $10."
5,"Bell Radar Dart Bike Helmet (Blue, Medium/Large)",I haven't used the helmet yet but I tried it and the fitting is very good. It looks good and it came at a good price. I'm happy with my product.
3,Helmet fit is not accurate,Helmet definitely not for people with large size heads. My head meaurement is 57cm and helmet just fits my head but is a tight around temples. Maybe I'll get used to it but first usage is slightly uncomfortable. Foam is dense and hard so protective capacity appears to be high as head seems well protected. Hope I don't need to find out. BELL is a trusted name for me and bought on their reputation.
5,Saved by the Bell!,"After I reconditioned my 35 year old English bike, I thought that I never used a helmet before, so why start now. But my wife insisted that I get a helmet so I looked for an inexpensive one on Amazon. The second time I road my bike, I went flying over the handlebars and totally wiped out. If I wasn't wearing my Bell Radar Bike Helmet, I'm quite sure I would not be writing this review. Bell - I won't leave home without it!!"
3,"to small, gave it away.","This helmet was to small and I didn't like the new elastic fit system. It won't take long for the elastic to wear out and then you'll need a new helmet. Sounds like something the U.S. car companies did back in the 60s and 70s, built in obsolescences."
3,Cheap but effective,"This helmet has an outer shell much like the plastic packaging of, say, a self serve MP-Player or such. The action is all in the foam lining - the color shel is a thin hard film of plastic. Not terribly elegant, but for the price I paid (under $10) quite a novelty"
3,"Decent, inexpensive helmet","This is a decent, inexpensive helmet.Pros:- This fits pretty well thanks to the internal, self adjusting, elastic hat band inside- It's lightweight- The chin strap is easily adjustable, stays where you set it and is comfortable- It's inexpensiveCons:- That internal, self-adjusting, elastic band I mentioned earlier? It's constantly squeezing your head. You won't notice this on short rides but after an hour or two you become pretty conscious of it. There are two plastic pieces in front that will dig into your forehead. Oh, my hat size is approximately 7 1/8. If your head is much bigger than this then this helmet is probably not for you.- The visor isn't very effective at blocking out the sun and mine actually arrived a little canted. It's thin plastic. What can you do?All in all, this is a nice, entry-level helmet for someone who doesn't have a big head."
3,Not so attractive,"I know bike helmets aren't meant to be flattering, but the cheaper Bell helmets, like this one, tend to make one look like a mushroom-head. After much careful study and input from friends, it appears the the problem lies in the extra swath of visible grayish styrofoam along the hairline, giving the whlle thing a less-than-sleek look. That said, it keeps my head unsmushed, so I'll wear it anyway."
2,Average helmet,"I bought this helmet and a Kent USA Aero helmet ,and comparatively its not all that good.You can get the Kent for just $2-3 more.The fastening system on this one isnt what I would call original.The Kent has a snugger fit.Also there is very little extra padding(just a small piece for the forehead whereas Kent gives you the whole thing),but for $15 what more could you ask for.My wife says she's not going to wear it anyway .So i guess this is for those who buy a helmet just because the law binds you to wear one!!!"
3,too big,"I ordered the small/medium and it is still too large for my head and slides around. I guess I will have to go for the kiddie size next time. Other than that it is a typical bike helmet. Not as sleek as a giro, but it will work."
4,Straps are a little short,"I bought this helmet after reading the head size. I had one of these when I lived in England and got into some pretty nasty crashes that I was lucky to have a helmet that was a fixed size because I had previously had helmets come off that were adjustable. The helmet fits my head perfect, but the straps are barely long enough for me to do up the buckle and on some hotter days in the 115 degree weather it is sometimes very uncomfortable having the straps that tight. Other than that I love the helmet!"
4,quality helmet,"This is my first helmet and it is lightweight and has great ventilation. Kool art on it. My two friends had just purchased theirs, for about twice as much money, then tried mine and returned theirs to reorder this one. They thought the fit was a lot better. Thanks for the great price!"
2,Too Small,I am barely a size large (as medium is too tight) and this helmet was way too tight and there was no way to adjust it upwards in size so it is not a true large at all.
3,helmet bell,"anyway i get this helmet from amazon , for beginer i think is not to bad but if you real for mountain bike just make sure u need good helmet. just for you ride bike this helmet stiil ok"
4,Buena compra,"Buen casco de proteccion, muy util aunque algo pesado, pero esta bien para el precio, lo encontre en Amazon mas barato que en cualquier otro lugar."
2,Poor recording,Have listened to it once. Piano is really too loud and unclear and voice is so up and down in volume...
3,A good read,"I came upon this book by chance and started reading it because i had extra time on my hands. i had low expectations for the book but i was proved wrong. i thought the romance between Lady Myrtle and Ian was sweet. He was masquerading as a servant in his own home. Each day that he spent in her company, his admiration and desire for her grew but could not reveal his identity. All in all, it was a delightful read."
4,Hey...it's an air filter/,"I installed this a couple of weeks ago on my 4 runner. Not sure that it made any difference in terms of performance, but I love the fact that this is probably the last air filter I will ever have to buy."
2,Life Application NASB Bible,"It is an excellent Bible for the message an notes but very very very thin paper. found this out by going to Christian book store and looking at it physically. I make lots of noters in my Bibles . I went to a Christian Book Store 30 miles away and saw the contents of this Bible.. I write notes, underline, and circle I was very disappointed in the thin paper, so I sent it back. In my opinion the Bible is one book that should have very good quality of paper. Barb. B."
3,Life Application Bible NASB,"While I absolutely love the NASB for its literal translation, I am not happy at all with the quality of this binding from Zondervan. I only had this product for a month before the front pages began falling out! I am completely disappointed, given the price of this particular Bible. As a side note, however, I contacted Amazon and they quickly resolved the situation, sending me a brand new one overnight. I am hoping the binding issue was a fluke thing, but given the other reviews on Zondervan's Bible binding, I don't hold much faith in this new one."
5,Life Application Study Bible,My father already had one and my mom loved it. They really like the layout and study notes. She says it really helps with her young couples Sunday School class and the 'in-depth' questions she gets each week.
3,Pretty good study Bible,"As the title says this Bible is not to bad. It has pluses- like the great introductions at the beginning of each book along with nice maps and character studys. On the negative side if you're looking for a study Bible with a strong dose of theology in the notes, look elsewhere. I use this Bible when I teach teens in my Sunday school class because the notes are geared towards applying Biblical principles to your life. In that area it's a great Bible, for serious study try the NASB study Bible by Zondervan."
3,There's only so much brilliance one can take.,"It's ironic how Tarkovsky is often used as the supreme benchmark of tortured artistic European depth and integrity with which to castigate the shallowness of Hollywood formulae, because this, in many ways, resembles what lazily passes for a typical Tinseltown product - a rejection of analysis and complexity in favour of mindless fantasy, facile ideas and cardboard characterisations. Even what is admirable in the film - the evocation of domestic space - was achieved with considerably more economy and power in the American films of Ophuls, Ray and Sirk. What's left are some breathtaking, if eventually wearing, sequence shots. We applaud, oh yes, but duty is never really enough."
4,The Demiurge Spake,To all of those captious parties whistling in the dark: damnant quod non intellegunt
2,badly packaged,This comment does not refer to this important piece of art cinema but to Morninglory Music: the dvd box arrived smashed. Its packing is not up to amazon standards
4,DVD quality is average,"This is the latest Tarkovsky movie, and we could expect just a perfect transfer. It seems to me that the master is probably perfect but the transfer (compression) has been done too fast or wrong. There is much grain in the picture, pixels visible especially on edges of objects lokks scintillating, and the dark scenes are horrible. The scene at night when Alexander walks to the maid's house is crispy and garbled. And besides the picture looks squeezed vertically (slightly) which makes a very slight concave effect. Otherwise the film is very good. DVD is OK."
3,What can I say ?,"What can I say? Director of this film Andrei Tarkovsky (one of the best Russian directors) was already an immigrant at the time when he made this film. Soviet government made him leave his country. Same as ""Nostalgia"", this film shows how much he was heart. At the same time he was very sick and he didn't have much time left. He was in hurry ... you can tell. Used his cinematography from previous films but it didn't work.Last 15 minutes - was a movie ""The Sacrifice"". The privies 2 hours? Just trying to put all his thoughts in one film.If you want to se best films by Andrei Tarkovsky, go to : ""Stalker"", ""Solaris"", ""Andrei Rublev"", ""Mirror"".Mr. Tarkovsky, I still think - you are the best! Your film ""Stalker"" changed my life."
2,Twitch of the Deaf Nerve,"If you love buying videotapes mastered in the dreaded E.P. mode, with atrocious sound quality, improper letter- boxing and grainy picture quality-this title is for you. It's very fortunate I didn't waste more money by ordering the DVD edition, because apparently it isn't any better. As for the film itself, it is impossible to judge under these circumstances. The plot is difficult to follow due to the incomprehensible dialogue and the visuals are hard to appreciate. If Image is restoring this to add to their Bava collection, you would be well advised to wait."
1,Bottom of the barrel,"This early slasher flick didn't interest me at all. I found it way too confusing, horribly acted, clumsily edited, terribly written and so on and so on...I like most of Bava's films, but this one is the bottom of the barrel.My advice, check out any other Bava movie. ANY."
2,"EXCELLENT movie, but...","...be warned.You have NEVER heard audio so bad on a DVD.Trust me. This is the most incredibly BAD audio experience you'll ever have. Dialogue is near-impossible to hear. Music suddenly swells and threatens the life of your speakers. Shrill sounds fade away into near-silence, as you lean-in to the screen/stereo, hoping to catch a word or two.....It's brain-numbingly bad. I've never heard anything so awful in my life before, and hope never to again.I'm not trying to steer anyone away from the film, it's a wonderful black comedy, and certainly one of the most influential horror films of all time (setting the stage for the now-common 'slasher film'). As well, the picture on this DVD is excellent, nice and crisp, wonderful colours, and a few great trailers which are icing on the cake.Just... be warned about the audio.Hopefully"
2,An early gory slasher flick with a mediocre DVD transfer,"This is one of the first gory slasher films from the early seventies, which inspired the many films of this type in the eighties. It's a tale of a group of people after a precious land development in a bay, who kill one another for control of it. There are some good effects from that era, especially an axe in a face scene. The ending is surprising, and the film generally has a unique feel to it. The DVD is below average. The picture is not good, and the extras are just factoids on the film. A good horror film with an below average DVD transfer, but it is fairly cheap."
4,Great Horror Film,"Mario Bava brings us a classic horror film, that almost every horror buff has studied, and every director at that...Friday the 13th ripped this film off in many ways, but it still stands head above the rest as being a great horror film."
5,"Great movie, shame on image entertainment!","In short, another masterpiece from horror maestro bava and a beautiful widescreen transfer dvd with one litte exception, in terms of sound quality this is the worst dvd ever released!!!The music is as loud and distorted as each dialogue is low and barely audible unless you have a stadium sound equipment of course. So DON'T BUY IT and go for a vhs or dvd english edition of this one, it's not uncut but the sound is perfectly OK. Shame, shame, shame Image Entertainment!!!"
1,Could hardly hear a full sentence,"I usually interpret criticisms of sound quality as coming from people who are hard-core audiophiles with unreasonably high expectations. In this case, the criticisms are absolutely valid. I can't even really tell you the plot of this movie (at least based on the dialogue), because I could hardly hear a complete sentence. It was an abyssmal experience to say the least, by the end I had a headache from turning the volume up and down so many times.I agree with the reviewer who felt betrayed by Image for releasing this DVD. They indeed should have eaten the loss and tried again. This is a full-on defective product and I don't think Amazon should even offer it for sale."
1,DVD Quality Scarier Than The Film,"Terrible picture and audio quality on this DVD mar Bava's pioneering effort. The transfer is just the pits, I'm sorry to say, and takes away from the film's enjoyment.There's rumored to be another release of this coming from the same folks who recently released ""Black Sunday"", with which they did an excellent job. Wait for that, and pick up ""Black Sunday"" or ""Baron Blood"" in the meantime."
2,Sound quality makes DVD worthless,"The movie is classic Bava and Image's widescreen transfer looks great. HOWEVER! The soundtrack is abominable. As others have said, you have to constantly turn the volume up and down to hear what's going on. But in way too many scenes, the volume doesn't matter because the sound is so choppy and distorted you can't hear it at any level. Image should've eaten the loss and passed on releasing this DVD to its loyal fan base. As a consumer, my faith in Image is now shaken and who knows what crap they may push in the future? I know it's only one disappointment in a history of prestige, but I remember the first time I saw commercials on cable channel AMC. Twas the beginning of the end."
3,Very strange film,"First, I must say that this film has its own place in history of horror film,but I was expecting something another.First half hour is excellent with bloody murders of the teenagers,but then you dont expects so many killers,motives,and strange music.I dont say that this film is SO bad,but there is so much better Italian horrors out there."
3,Not bad,"Bay of Blood's not a bad movie, but yeah it does have the same thing as Friday the 13th. But only this movie has more of a real graphic, when the young girl's head is chopped off. It wasnt like most horror movies with blood just going everywhere, or fake bones inside, it looked so real. The movie wasnt so bad, better then most movies."
4,"Great Bava, lousy sound","I don't really consider myself a really big fan of Italian horror, seeing as how, for an example, I feel Lucio Fulci is supremely overrated. But this one has a special place in my heart simply because it's so different plot-wise. Sure, everyone dies a grisly death (it's gory even by today's standards, and this was 1971!), but it's all driven by greed, as people knock others off to try to get the rights to a bayside mansion. We get to learn about each character and why they might be a killer (save for the prerequisite doomed teens) and Bava peppers the film with neat cut-aways and lead-ins that intersperse perfectly with the next scene. Very fun, and very different. Too bad we can't get any decent sound on the DVD, and the picture isn't that good either. Pick it up anyway!!"
3,bloody effects help boring movie,"The beautiful colors, camera angles, and bloody effects are what kept me watching this movie. The actors in this have to be some of the most un-charismatic ever! it was fun to see them dispatched before they could say another word and put me to sleep! This is the english version and unfortunately the dubbing is not funny, something that would have helped the entertainment value. Like most european horror this is shocking because of the violence and not scary, with very little suspense(see ""let's scare jesica to death"" if you want all that). DVD picture is very good, bright and colorful. Audio is in english only and very low. special features trailers of other Bava titles."
4,Scenic Cruises,"Been to most of these places that were in this DVD. There just as breathtaking on T.V. as in person. The movie or DVD was great,...scenery was breathtaking,...if you haven't done any of this ,...i would suggest,...... go and do at least one of these cruises,...you won't be sorry!!"
4,WONDERFUL BOOK,"VERY GOOD BOOK IF YOU ARE CRUISING THE DIFFERENT ISLANDS IN HAWAII. THE ONLY THING LAKING WAS MAPS FOR DRIVING TOURS, OTHERWISE VERY COMPLETE AND EASY TO FOLLOW."
4,grill cookbook,So far so good with the cookbook. The recipes are good and the book has come in handy already. I recommend it for the novice griller.
5,Great grill book!,I have used the original Gas Grill Gourment for several years. My children both have requested many recipes from me so now they each have this new book and love it!
5,ONE OF THE BEST FINNEST COLOGNES EVER!!!!,ONE OF THE FINNEST COLOGNES EVER. A CLASSIC. i ALWAYS GO WITH THE CLASSIC TIMELES FRAGANCES.YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG WITH GUERLINE.
3,not what you think,"Basic Guitar assumes the reader already has a familiarity with guitars. There is extremely limited info on all the basics a beginning would need to know--how to hold, string, strum, hand position, etc. It is BASIC Guitar, not BEGINNER Guitar. if you're just getting started with little to go on, look some place else. If, however, you're a guitarist with some experinece, you'll probably find the articles, with tips from Eddie Van Halen and Eric Clapton, interesting and informative."
2,Soapy lime Hint water?,"I absolutely LOVE Hint water, but even though I read the reviews on the Lime flavor, I really should have believed Jodi's review of the Lime flavor. It doesn't taste like lime at all, and has the soapiest flavor I've ever tasted. Soapy water isn't all that bad to drink, but this is horrible! There are only two or three flavors I don't like, and Lime is at the top of the list. I still have 11 bottles more of this stuff to drink. Can HINT take the soapy taste out of the lime? I love lime, and expected far better flavor than what this presents."
4,"Hint waters are great, and this is no exception","I've tried several of the Hint line of waters, and I'm a big fan of all of them. If you don't like lime, you should avoid this. It's basically like having a slice of lime in a glass of water, with a slightly stronger flavor. One of the stronger flavors of the hint varieties I've tried so far."
4,brmc songs,This cd single comes with 2 b-sides the 12 & a half minute abstract dragon a long song but still really good.It also includes waiting here which should have been on the album.Well worth the money & it comes with a poster.
2,Seemed like a reprint of a bulletin board,The book was primarily a reprint of short quotes grouped together by subject. There was no summary information or analysis. I stopped reading half way through. Very boring!
1,Wrong Technical Details,Its useless product and the poduct description is completely wrong1. It just has some random setting2. No Grounded outlet as mentioned in Technical Details3. Its not digital as mentioned in in Technical Details
1,Buyer beware...,"If you look at the small print on the cover (which unfortunately I didn't), you will find that this is a REPACKAGE of the Under Review dvd with a short ""bonus"" cd of interviews. Save your money!!"
1,Who's responsible for these things?,"Again...another expensive DVD where (a'huh-huh-huh) some ""scholars"" ""discuss"" Mott The Hoople. Thanks, guys; be real, OK?"
3,Is it just me?,"I used this for the first time last night. Last night I made braised short ribs, and needed to skim the fat from the sauce. Maybe it is just me but it did not work. All the fat came right through the skimmer. Bummer."
3,Never ask,"""What makes Iago evil?"" some ask. ""I never ask.""The first line of dialogue from the zoned out protagonist, Maria Wyeth. I've always found it pretentious, but it describes Maria perfectly. Maria isn't curious. She doesn't ask. She's dazed and confused, and she plays it as it lays.This book is as bleak and stark as the desert Maria circumnavigates in her purposeless drives across the freeway. Maria's husband is abusive, her daughter retarded, her friends creeps, alcoholics, and users. Things just happen to her. She gets pregnant. She has an abortion. Her best friend's husband commits suicide and by the end of the novel, Maria ends up in the loony bin throwing the I-Ching--a game of chance. Before you read this book, make sure you have a month's supply of anti-depressents on hand. You'll need them. Despite that, Didion's prose is compelling in its deadpan, anomic way."
