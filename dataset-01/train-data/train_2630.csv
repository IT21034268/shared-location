1,A disappointing finale to a brilliant series,"I've read all the previous books in the Hyperion series, and loved them. The Rise of Endymoin, however, was a major comedown. First, the two protagonists, Raul Endymion and Aenea, were about as 2D as you can get. Raul was just a camera on legs, and Aenea lost all sembelance on humanity and became a cloyingly sweet saint. The Pax bad guys were far more interesting, and Father Captain de Soya was a truely brilliant character.The ending was worst of all -- transparently a frantic attempt to wrap up loose ends. This is a thought -provoking book -- the thought being, why the hell did a writer as good as Dan Simmoins write this dog?"
1,"This book should be retitled to ""The Bore of Endymion"".","This is the most tiresome book I've ever read. Instead of just dropping it, which I rarely do to a book but was sorely tempted, I decided to ""speed read"" parts of it just to know how it all ends. I don't know why I bothered. Read the 1st 3 books and have someone give you a synopsis of the 4th. I was so turned off by it's verbiage that it's unlikely I'd ever buy another Dan Simmons book again."
3,A reasonable conclusion,I decent conclusion to the series. A believeable ended and good story overall.
4,"If you wanted answers, here you are","Though I felt confused in some parts of the book, the story was wrapped up with good style and a very, very good ending.I hope to read something more from Dan Simmons"
2,insipid crap,"Hyperion was very good, and sometimes great, and the Fall of Hyperion was a decent follow-up, so I was expecting good things when I bought Endymion and Rise of Endymion. Unfortunately, I was dissapointed. The Rise of Endymion, in particular, is terrible. We are forced to read about Aenea's insipid philosophy/metaphysics, which holds that love is the driving force of the universe. Please. Simmons actually managed to raise some interesting points in his first books, but here he has obviously stretched himself too far. Aenea's message is touchy-feely New Age nonsense that bears no relation to actual philosophy. Simmon's mistreatment of Zen Buddhism borders on the criminal. Others have recommended that you pretend that this series ends after the first two books. I agree. Ignore Endymion and its sequel."
2,Disappointment,"I would have to agree with the comments of the reviewer who said ""another serious run into the ground."" Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion are two of my favorite SF books ever. The next two in the series just completely fail to live up to the standard. Many things bother me about the second half of this series, primarily the fact that Simmons belittles the story and events which happened in the first half. The characters are completely uninteresting -- the Anea/Raul-as-foil dialog became increasingly more annoying with every turn of the page. The constant deus ex machina-character ruined any feeling of suspense. There is more potential for engaging narrative in an episode of the A*Team than in this book because the reader knows exactly how every conflict will be won.Instead of reading this book, go back and read the first two again."
3,Too Long By (almost) Half,"This last volume of the Hyperion saga has some very nice ideas, and interesting descriptions of where the action takes place. However, it is too long by at least 200-250 of its 700-plus pages. This excessive length detracts from the impact of the main storyline, which would have been strong enough itself to propel a shorter novel into the realm of the best that recent science fiction has to offer."
4,if you read all four books it's a great ending,"It took me a while to get into Dan Simmons world, but this last book is a great conclusion, with a lot off insights. I loved the long, sad ending - beautifully done. Everything falls into place, a lot of the questions that keep you going through the first books are answered, many in a surprising way. Some profound ideas - and a lot of stuff to get you dreaming of humankinds possibilities - and I really liked what Simmons did to the Catholic church at the very end."
1,Not worth the wait,"Boring, Blah, and Boy what a waste of time that book was. After such a great start, I have a hard time believing this book was supposed to give us closure. I almost wish I hadn't read it because of the way it taints even Hyperion, a truly wonderful book. Dont waste your time with this one."
1,Awful - rated one star because I couldn't pick zero stars,"The first 3 books were great, with each exceeding the previous. The last in the series is awful, with flat characters and the heroine being an irritating and boring imitation of a TV evangelist. I couldn't wait to pick up the 1st 3 books, and I can't wait to put this one down. Simmons at his worst."
5,Great story,"The best read this year. The story and the characters have amazing depth. The underlying love story is sweet/bitter and reminded me of Knut Hamsun's Victoria. The ending is painful, inventive and surprising, it made me weep and feel happy at the same time."
4,Just a LITTLE boring.,"I'm not being sarcastic. It was a little boring at times. Simmons could have clipped about 100 pages from the book - especially where he spent too much time describing the beautiful places where the character happened to be.I like the characters in Endymion and Rise of Endymion. In a book like this, it would be too easy to make characters over the top but here but the good guys have their weaknesses and so do the bad guys.Although the Shrike always conveniently appears when he's needed, it's fun to read how Aenea and Raul get out of their difficult situations.The ending is enjoyable, especially if you embrace the main characters of the story."
5,"Finally, a SF series that ends as strongly as it begins!","""Rise of Endymion"" is easily the strongest book in the series for Dan Simmons. There are flaws, to be sure, but he takes on themes that no other SF writer even gets close to in a mature, even philosophical way. This whole series is well worth the read if only for getting to the last book."
3,Hyperion,"The book was very well written and is a lot of fun to read but the ending is rushed. I thought the next two sequels were mediocre but the Rise of Endymion was really good. Overall, I think the series is worth reading, although in hindsight, I would skip the middle two."
1,Flabbiest book I've ever read!,"Most unnecessary and annoying narrator! Most pompous, fatuous and annoyingly (meaninglessly) cryptic main character! Biggest waste of wood pulp I've read in years!Stick with the first Hyperion and don't bother wondering about the answers to the many provocative questions Simmons raises -- he doesn't have the answers and he never will."
4,Wonderful writing again... but he drives it too far,"Alright, this book is fast-paced, filled with wonderful ideas and very, very entertaining. The universe in which it's set ist one of the most vivid I've ever read about. But the story... ...where is the story? The over-powerful Aena and Raul travel here and there, do this and that... ...as in Endymion (Book 3 in the series) the story is too weak to hold it all together. A history book about the Hyperion/Endymion background would be more fun to read."
4,"need a good messiah, anyone?","I'll admit the blatant sentimentality got me at the end. Ok. I'm adult, I can deal with it. And yes, I loved the book anyway. Again, intellectual snobbery aside, I thought it was fantastic. When you get so wound up in characters and stories like these, you can forgive wordiness and some of the other ""sins"" of a literary masterpiece. And while this book might be the weakest of the series, it is not by any means weak...quite the contrary...it completes a full cycle masterpiece.So ok. I've read the whole series and I have to say what a rush. It's been a long time since I've had the pleasure of involving myself in such a tangible world. Fictional world, that is. Thank you, Mr. Simmons, for the gift of inspired emotion and thought. Life is a little richer for your contribution."
5,One of the best Sci-Fi books I have ever read!,"Dan Simmons' 'Hyperion Cantos' series, a 4-book story, are among the best Sci-Fi books I have ever read. Combining the massive scope, epic heroism, and grand stakes of a space opera - with timeless humanity, sensitivity, and a well-cultured and deeply thoughtful spirituality. I don't know how Dan Simmons does it, but he manages to interweave centuries of literature, history and philosophy in such a way as to enrich the stories. You will not be able to put these books down! You will be sad when you finish them because you'll be begging for more."
2,"Too much padding, too many problems.","I, too, loved Hyperion and (to a lesser extent) The Fall of Hyperion. In comparison, the Endymion books are sad. Where the first books offered just about everything good science fiction can--mindbending situations, intricate world building, colorful characters, and thrilling adventure--the Endymion books substitute page upon page of padding, mundane chase plots with literally dozens of deus ex machinas, and gobs of unconvincing exposition to tie things up neatly at the end. There are also many sloppy plot points--like why does Aenea need to hanglide (for 50 pages!) to the far mountain if she can farcast anywhere."
2,"Sorry, this one annoyed me",This book annoyed me. And that was sad after Hyperion and The Fall of Hyperion were SO good. The characters annoyed me and the subjects became too metaphysically weird. I found the ending predictable and some of the scenes that had the most potential action and drama occurred off-stage. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of just one is because the worlds that Dan Simmons described were still fascinating and well visualized. I just didn't need to have a character visit every single one and tell me the name of every mountain there when he wasn't going to visit each one.
4,The end of the Cantos,"It's finally over. Simmons' ""Cantos"" series concludes in fairly good form, again the last 100 pages are eminently readable, but the rest still a little slow. What's more, like the later Dune books by Herbert or Xenocide by Card, Simmons gets a little too wrapped up in his world and his world gets a little too weird. The ""floating city"" and whole Buddhist mountain world bit was as tedious as Card's line tracing. Still, I guess I have to recommend reading the series, the slow spots and odd segments are the price we all have to pay to have another possible vision of the universe, and that's what reading most scifi is about anyway."
2,Missing Pages,"I loved the first three and was eagar to get to the fourth - but beware - in my paperback edition page 150 leads directly to page 215. Later, page 246 is followed by page 183. Maybe pages 150-183 farcasted somewhere, or were devoured by the Ultimate Intelligence. Check your paperback carefully before purchasing! Emails to Bantam Books will go unanswered, I assure you. It must be the work of the evil Pope Julius the whatever. Please help!"
5,A book So like Hyperion but so different.,"I have just finished reading this book. It is much different from Hyperion, but is also alike. I think the opening of the book sums it up for the critics of this exellent book - ""You are reading this for the wrong reason"". I have finished the book in a mere two days read and enjoyed every moment of it. Especially, the terror I felt after reading the ""thing's"" exploits and thoughts still haunts me."
1,"Look no further, if..","Look no further, if..you want a horrible compilation of Calypso. The stuff there from Barbados is no where near as upbeat, the stuff from the Bahamas isn't authentic. If you want some real dancy Calypso, I would reccomend the album ""The Party Classics"", which is a compilation of The Mighty Sparrow's party hits. As a second generation Canadian (my family is from Trinidad), most of this was quite insulting to the origins of Calypso."
2,It's okay. Just don't expect Mighty Sparrow.,"Both side are right in the ongoing disagreement about the quality of this CD. Yes, it has quite a few pleasant songs on it, with some Caribbean character, that many will like to hear. And, no, this isn't calypso by any conventional definition. At the very best, one could pick out maybe two or three songs that more-or-less fit into that classification - ""No More Rocking and Rolling"" and ""Barbados Carnival"", at least - although even those are not especially characteristic of the style. It's decent music, but not good calypso."
1,Ghastly,Horrible CD. I can't believe that this is what people are passing of as vitage calypso. Don't get this CD.
5,Marvellous & Original,"I love this album...I'm agree with the other reviews that the most talented musician in Jane's Addiction is the most obscured,Eric Avery...I'm playing this album every day since almost a year.If you can,try to look for the ""Chewingum E.P."" too,it's even most awesome!!!A strange thing:now Avery is playing for Alanis Morrisette(?!)."
2,"creatively brilliant, technically [BAD]!!!","I'm sort of new to the world of King Kong. Bought this disc cause it had many trax that covered several albums. As I listened I was both amazed by the musical genius and repulsed by the sound quality. After vomitting in my mouth several times, and checking every setting on my system for what was wrong I read the liner notes. These songs are demo's dude recored himself. I have a CD full of test material the artist recorded himself onto a cassette deck using it's single condensor microphone. He did this while sitting in his underwear in his living room. Kind of a cool idea until you try to listen to it. Any way I bought the rest of the CD's to get the decent quality I wanted and am very happy with them. To summarize.... If you like sound quality similar to underwater AM radio, this is the Kong for you. If you like clean tight Kong buy Funny Farm or Me Hungry!"
5,Love these sandals,"They are very comfortable. I had the Sperry captiva sandals before these, and after some years I had to replace them and Santa Cruz were the model replacing them. I like slide sandals, cannot stand thong ones. Paid top price but I'm a happy camper."
3,Not as gum as it seems...,"Fun consept-book with an interesting style. I'm afraid it's not a ""must have"" for a designer. Looks like a book/package it was fun to make more than anything else. But, hey it was 16 $. :-)"
2,Low cost CD player - feels low cost,"This CD player is cheaper than most but will leave you with the feeling that its cheap for a reason. Seemingly made entirely of plastic the controls are flimsy, unresponsive, and poorly designed. I've only owned it about a month and it is working fine and can play a variety of formats. Disappointed that it didn't come with an AC adapter. After adding the price of an AC adapter it brings it up to the price of better models. If you're on a limited budget for this type of device and will only use it with batteries then this one will suffice otherwise I'd look elsewhere."
3,How the mighty have fallen,"Go back to the early volumes of Motown Chartbusters and they are big hits from first to last. Songs everybody knows and loves, but this is just a collection of mediocrity. Sure the big names are there, Smokey Robinson, Michael Jackson, Diana Ross etc. But with the exception of a few there are no big songs. Big motown hits are getting few and far between, and they have lost their magic. Make this the last of the Motown Chartbuster series (or change it to Motown Some-Minimal-Chart-Success) and let it die a dignified death."
5,Life of Mother Teresa in Word and Image.,"This pictorial biography is a beautiful tribute to the Nobel Prize laureate and acclaimed Catholic saint of the 20th century, Mother Teresa. Her long life of service to the poorest of the poor and the public recognition she received are well highlighted here with text and photographs. Beginning with her early childhood in the Balkans, the book lays out before the reader her vocation, her founding of a new order and the fast spread of it, the respect and honor she commanded, to her retirement and eventual death in 1997. It is indeed the extraordinary story of a woman whose faith and dedication combined with love and compassion for others made her a symbol of loving kindness and benevolence in the whole world. The story is skillfully told in words and in pictures. There are more than 100 full color as well as black and white photographs presented in this magnificent tribute to the most courageously compassionate person of our times."
5,The basic of Poison,Great book! I bought it for my PhD as my main book and it is great. Very organize and explanatory. Not a lot of pictures though.
2,Poor quality,"I have every C&D from the 3d edition. I bought this copy solely to study for the DABT exam. Imagine my surprise when I stat to look for citations in the index, and things like formaldehyde and methylene chloride are not there at all, even though there's a full page on MC in the book. While the index of the 6th edition is 39 pages, this one only has 16. If you are buying this to read full chapters, you're probably OK, but if you're looking up specific items, good luck. After full satisfaction with 4 editions in a row, they really went cheap on this one."
2,A dumbed-down version of a great classic,"This edition is a great disappointment after the previous editions, up to and including Edition 6. It remains useful enough, perhaps as a student text, but as a source book it's usefulness has been seriously compromised. I seriously recommend buying the 6th edition instead."
5,not enough detail,"the book is huge, and lots of topics. it is supposed to be a toxicology standard. however, the authors act afraid to go into any detail. try to find a better book. this will disappoint."
1,Half the price at amazon.co.uk. ...,"The book is sold for around 93 USD at amazon.com whereas in the UK you can purchase the book for around half the price although in both cases sold via an Amazon-company... Unfortunately, this low price is only for customers in the UK so all we others have to buy for 93 USD???"
2,errors in the book,"That is a good book for the beginner of toxicologist. However, many existed errors may mislead and confuse the beginners. So I recommend that we'd wait for next edition."
5,Hell yes!,"It is a book on things that can potentially kill you! What is not to love!But seriously, I am in grad school for Pharmacology and Toxicology and this book is basically my bible. That and Goodman and Gilman's book."
5,DOG COAT,"Nice dog coat, will help keep the Chinese Crested warm on walks this winter. Looks just like real shearling, but is all fabric. Sized a little smaller than other brands, if unsure, order a size larger than your usual size."
5,Great value,"I was looking for a hand meat grinder. I read the reviews ands bought the cucinapro piece. I called their office and was directed how to use my new grinder perfectly. The lady there said to wash the unit well, run some bread through the grinder to remove any more grease from manufacturing and spray the unit with Pam or something like that. So far this piece is perfect. we ground up chicken breast perfectly. We love it."
1,waste of my money and my time,"This is the worst, poorly machined piece of junk, - parts do not quite fit, and it can't grind even ground meat. Also, it rusts. I bought it just to combine ground pork with ground beef and bread soaked in milk. It failed to do that. It does not come with the pestle that you use to push the meat down. The screw that holds it to the table lost tread on the second use."
1,Metal Burrs on Cutter Plate,"Words can't describe how poorly this unit was made - cheap castings, cheap plastic and worst of all, many holes in the fine cutting plate were improperly drilled, leaving burrs. Even after careful cleaning and deburring of the cutting plate, the unit left metal shavings in the ground food. A clear case of getting what you pay for..."
2,Product not as described on Amazon,"The package came on time, and it seems sturdy enough, but there are absolutely no instructions with this item and when I went to CucinaPro website to try and download instructions, or contact customer service, they don't have this item listed, so no instructions. Also,the description on Amazon says it includes 3 cutting discs and there are only two in the package."
3,Did the job but just so-so,"I have used the grinder only once for ground turkey - and it worked so, so. The clamp isn't big enough to clamp onto my counter - so that was a little inconvenient. My counter top is a standard size (1.5-2""). Also, there was no product info or directions or anything in the box to tell you how to use it, clean it, or store it. I emailed the company but never got a reply. I haven't used any other meat grinders so I can't say how it compares to others."
2,CucinaPro 265-08 Healthy Meat Grinder - #8,Very poor quality. Parts do not fit well. Very rough casting. Hard to turn. Blade edges with imperfections. No assembly instructions in the box.
4,reasonable quality for it's price,"I bought this grinder for 29 smth dollars after quite precise search. Do not expect it would do all the job for you. Pay attention to the correct direction of all knives that you install and it will grind your meat perfectly. Pay attention to wash all small holes thoroughly and than dry it, otherwise you will quickly find marks of corrosion on it (right after first wash). After washing and drying I spray parts with an oil, it works so far.Talking about grinding itself - it's all great. Any kind of meat, bread, veggies, etc. It perfectly fixes to the table, parts are nicely suitable to each other.I put 4 stars, because it's a good, workable product for it's price, though it still has some stuff to improve (like change metal to avoid corrosion)."
2,Cheaply made.,I got the product and found that it was very cheaply made and looked like it would break within a few weeks. Opted for a bit pricier electric model.
2,Grinder,Had a problem with the grinder the second time I used it. While attempting to make sausage at home the knife broke into several pieces.
1,horrible,"This was the worst purchase I ever made...in fact, I threw it away after the first attempt to use it."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,Product was cheaply made - started rusting after washing for the first time before use!!! Didn't come with any instructions either. Don't waste your money!
3,Mixed bag,"This grinder is made of solid, heavy metal, but it could have been better tooled. The metal ring holding the plate had nearly 1/4 inch of extra material inside, obstructing the opening so much my cookie cutter attachment would not even fit. I had to grind it out with a Dremel tool. This should have been done when it came out of the mold! The same thing was going on with the handle-end of the auger. It had to be ground off to allow the handle to fit. If I wasn't in a time-crunch I would have returned it, but since I needed it urgently I had to fix it to be able to use it. After the adjustments it worked very nicely!"
2,Just Adequate,This grinder is just adequate for light home meat grinding. Low price and low quality. Probably the same as all the inexpensive manual grinders.
5,Great song,I heard this song and some others from Sia in Europe. She is really good. I am looking forward for her new CD to be released soon
3,Surprising,"I must admit that this album was a surprise to me. I expected something along the lines of a Talib Kwaeli album, but it was definitely not that. I thought S doubles parts on previous Rawkus albums showed tons of promise, but his style seems to have shifted more to a pop expensive champagne and act like a thug. And we don't need any more of that type of rap. I get the impression that SS decided he needed to make money now, and in the process he made a mainstream album. He still has talents on the mic (breath control, good delivery), but his lyrics just are unimaginative throughout the album. The production isn't as good as I would have guessed either, and I found that there were maybe 3 songs that I liked enough to play again. Better than a Jay Z or LL or Ja Rule album, but not near the level that I believe Sadeeq is capable of."
5,Coil spring Santa elf hat,"This is an irregular and fun take-off on the classic stocking cap elf hat. It brings many smiles from passers-by as you walk down the street.You will not regret buying this hat, even if you get only one season's use out of it."
1,Still waiting,It has been over a month and I am still waiting on a Santa hat. I have not heard back from anyone regarding my questions and I have not received my purchase. I am very disappointed.
3,you have to use a key together with the code,"It is never clear in the discription that to open this safe, you have to use a key together with your combination code. So it is critical that you don't lose your key."
4,"Great Product with no real ""Key Issues""",The safe comes with an override key and two safe keys. The override key works without having to use the combination. The other keys require that you input the code. The manual does not give you the full instructions for opening the safe with the safe keys. I had to call the company and was given help. I love the safe.
3,Great Size but Poor Quality,"The Honeywell 0.6 cu. ft. safe we bought is only marginally working out for us. It is a very conveinant size but we wanted to mount it with the door facing up, not forward, and in that direction the entry lock sticks as the safe door is closed.Once in a while the door will close completely and allow removal of the key, but most of the time the door stays ajar and the key won't come out.I rotated the safe and it works correctly if the door is facing forward.Bottom line: it works, but not the way I wanted it to."
1,Very poor quality,"I had the same problem as a previous reviewer, the key is stuck in the lock (1st day using the safe). Even the most primitive QA process in the factory would have caught this. There's no excuse for this kind of thing, it's going back to Amazon."
1,flimsy,Item has a flimsey key which got stuck in lock and broke off on the first use. Never got to use it due to poor quality.
2,Sturdy,"It's a sturdy safe, however the regular keys didn't work, only the safety does. The point of the safe being digital is so you don't have to utilize a key, i use the key on this safe, the code doesn't open it, even if it did there's no handle so you need the key in the hole to have a makeshift handle. Not what i thought it was gonna be, wish i would have returned it."
4,Great For Minor Skin Rashes,"This product is a must in your medicine cabinet if you are prone to rashes or hives. Follow the instructions to make the right mix to apply to affected areas. Downside is sometimes it irritates surrounding healthy skin, especially is you leave on too long. But when nothing else works to soothe itchy and burning skin from a rash, this will usually do the job."
2,Still haven't received the item.,"This product was ordered on 2/18 to be delivered in 7-10 days. Instead of the 100 packet box ordered and paid for, I received a box of 12 packets. I immediately emailed the company but had to follow up with another email on 3/2. They apologized and said I could keep the incorrect order and they would ship the correct order which would go out immediately. Last week I contacted them again so I could get a tracking number since the item had still not arrived. They are not good at answering emails. I was then told that they had neglected to send the correct order as promised and would send it out immediately. Today is 3/22 and I still have not received the item. They said they would not charge shipping and include a $5 credit. I would have much preferred the product to arrive on time and correctly."
5,Awesome..,"At first I really didn't like this CD at all. I really just couldn't get into it. But after listening to it a lot recently it's finally grown on me.. and WOW, I'm glad it has! This is one of their best works for sure. It lacks the beautiful clean parts that I have grown to love Opeth for(although that's what Damnation is for) but all the heavy parts are just wonderful! This is really an amazing cd. Go buy it and let it grow on you, you will not be dissapointed!"
5,perfection,"this cd is nothing short of perfection, also check out; my arms, your hearse, still life, and blackwater park. all amazing"
3,"A good album, but not up to Opeth standards","I've given this one about 30 spins or so, and it's starting to grow on me. Still, I look at this as a step backward from the brilliant ""Blackwater Park"".My first listen invoked the same feelings I had when I first heard Metallica's self-titled album. I'm not saying that Opeth sold out, got old, or even worse...worked with Bob Rock. I'm saying that the songs lacked the musical complexity of their previous works (longer stretches with one riff, fewer time changes, etc.), and that even the lyrics seemed a little weak(the beginning of ""A Fair Judgement"" in particular). While, any other band should strive to be this good, Opeth has proven that they are far better.On this disc, ""Master's Apprentice"" and ""Deliverance"" are the standout tracks. For new listeners, I'd recommend that you start with ""Blackwater Park"" or ""Morningrise"" before picking up this one."
3,Boring.,"Opeth is a band full of geniuses. There is no disputing that.....however, with this release I found it very difficult to enjoy. I loved most of their albums, but this one had a problem that really irritated me. Each song is very long (which is okay) but half of the song will be really cool, while the second half is boring, plodding, and tedious to sit through.I saw pick up pretty much ANY other Opeth album but this one. Blackwater Park is a good starter, and build from there. This should only be picked up by the hardcore fan of Opeth.Sadly, I considered myself a hardcore fan......but I just can't get into this."
5,Great,"First of all, I have discovored Opeth by some kind of miracle,the same as I found Tool and Iced Earth; on a whim. I saw Deliverance and had heard a little about the band, but never really listened to any of there stuff, so I decided to pick it up. Best thing I've ever done since buying nima at first glance. Despite Mikael Akerfeldt death metal growling, which I am not overly fond of, Opeth is NOT death metal. They are much more than that, nearly rivaling Tool in listening pleasure. The varied riffs, solo's acoustic guitar, and the varying vocals from Akerfeldt keep the music from getting repetitive and boring during the songs, which average about 10 minutes. This is one of the greatest buys I have ever made, and I will be enjoying it for a long time. LONG LIVE REAL METAL"
4,relenting,"What is prog rock? This certainly is not. I don't like prog rock, and I like this. I think long tracks, with light/shade, and slow/fast, soft/hard etc. leads people to lazily brand this prog rock/metal. Really, this does not sound like King Crimson at all, or Yes, and Radiohead runs parallel to it. I mean, is Master of Puppets prog metal? No it's not. Opeth is a good metal band, and Deliverance is a good metal album. It's heavy, with distorted riffage, guttural vox and small-spaced, double-kick drumming - signatures of any metal band: but, here, well done. Four stars. Pick it up."
5,The most haunting Opeth record yet,"This is the kind of music we need more in America. Talented, original, innovative music that doesn't stick to a formula. This album has brutal singing and some of the most creative guitar work ever. Opeth has gottn even better on this new album. The restless Opeth ghosts haunt on. Best album I've heard all year!"
4,Opeth-Deliverance,"I strongly recommend this cd for anyone interested in Euopean grindcore. Opeth's musical talent and ""bleakness"" rather than overt worship of Satan also lend them credibility! Check out the last 3 minutes of ""Deliverance."" It's great to reign that down on some suburban droopy drawers wearing ""boom boxers"" at redlights. ""For absent friends"" eloquently brings us to ""Master's apprentices."" Scandanavian metal at it's best!"
5,Amazing music,"What amazing music! One of just a FEW bands that ""get it"". They know how music is supposed to sound, move you, THINK! Mikeal is a GREAT leader (singer, guitarist, writer, etc), MARTIN-all I can say is-what a drummer. Peter keeps rhythm with his solos, and the other Martin on bass knows how to keep the buzz going. And let's not forger Per on keyboards. Great cd!"
5,AWESUM EMO LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!LOL,"Dude, theez guyz are like the most awesum emo band ever lol. and i thot new found glory wuz hardcore lol. like, theez dudez arnt az hevy az GC, but thatz ok lol."
2,a fine melodic black metal cd but nothing special...,"I bought this cd cause I wanted to see what all the underground hype was about. I've heard this stuff before. Melodic Swedish Black Metal...been around since about 1994 and its been done much better. Its a fine cd for what it is. But its nothing unique or original. And thats why I give it 2 stars. I have about 15 bands just like this one that date back years ago. Why should I care about these guys. Find any band thats Swedish and melodic black/death metal and they all sound the same. Decent music, but not groundbreaking at all. **"
2,What's all the hype about this band?,"Why is this band so critically acclaimed? All of the songs sound pretty much the same and you can't understand a word the ""singer"" is saying. Each song is like an overlong run-on sentence!"
5,simply amazing.,"I was at my friends house one day, and we were talking about music. We both liked metal, however he sugggested i try the heavier side of metal. He played some old cradle of filth, which i liked. then he played the title track on this album.It blew me away. The mix of soft and heavy rock was near-perfect, and mikael's voice sent me into shock. All 13:35 minutes of it were godly. Its still my favorite opeth song. It's also the song that got me into the heavier side of metal."
3,3 stars for Crypt - 0 for Vault,"Tales from the crypt one of my faves from the 70s, a good print and a good film. However 'Vault' is as has been mentioned badly cut, id advise horror fans to find an old Vipco version or record if it comes to tv ubcut, then why not record off tv."
3,"Good DVD, but with one problem","The quality of both films on this DVD is beautiful. 'Tales From The Crypt' is uncut, but 'The Vault of Horror' has been cut in three of the five stories! I've asked Fox why. All the most horrific moments in 'The Vault of Horror' (in particular, scenes with Daniel Massey & Terry-Thomas) have been cut and the picture frozen. Buy this DVD for 'Tales From The Crypt', but not the other. This is wrong what Fox have done, they've released a DVD containing a film with three parts removed. I am positive that is against consumer law. I am in England so am not totally sure, but those U.S customers can find out, and complain if so. If it wasn't for that, I would rate this DVD five stars. The UK VIPCO DVD of 'Vault' is uncut, but is full screen and just basic quality, that sadly does not match the quality of this [cut] Fox DVD. Shame."
3,"WHATS WITH THE CRAPPY ""VAULT OF HORROR""?","The geniuses at Fox have released the censored version of ""Vault Of Horror"". I'm sick of people not doing their jobs properly. Not only did these numbskulls release a chopped-up, blacked-out version of """"Vault"", but the ""Theatrical Trailer"" extra is in black and white - BLACK AND WHITE! AND THE BLACK AND WHITE THEATRICAL TRAILER CONTAINS THE UNEDITED AND UNCENSORED VAMPIRE SCENE! What the... Well, maybe ten years from now when I'm too deaf to enjoy the movie properly they'll issue the complete version. Or maybe not. Maybe this is all we'll get from these clowns. Hey, I've got an idea...why doesn't Fox hire a horror movie fan to supervise their horror movie releases? Duh?"
3,FALSE ADVERTISING......,"As everyone is finding out, fans (as well as those who've never seen them) of the British horror anthologies of the 70's have been dealt a blow with Fox's release of ""Tales from the Crypt"" and ""Vault of Horror"". As everyone is also finding out, ""Tales"" looks good and is intact, while ""Vault"" is badly edited. Well, that's because ""Tales"" was originally rated PG and ""Vault"" was rated R. And what really burns me up is that it's advertised by Fox (and on Amazon) as still retaining it's R rating. Leading one to believe, of course, it's in it's original theatrical release form. Not so. To me, this is false advertising. I have never seen ""Vault of Horror"", I've only known of it. I was really looking forward to finally seeing it---in it's original release form. But now, with this disc, I can't enjoy it with THIS chop job. As one reviewer said, ""What's the point?"". What a ripoff. And illegal too."
3,What's The Point...,"...of releasing Vault in a badly cut form? I've already received my discs and, for the price, the set is worth it for Tales (which is uncut and in great shape), so I won't be returning it. So, I do recommend buying the set for this film. However, it is inexcusable that Fox would release Vault it a censored version. Really, what is the point? The cuts are ""brutal"", in that they are really ragged looking freeze frames and the actual violence is mild compared to the normal fare seen on the screens these days.This really speaks more for sloppiness than anything else. The uncut version is available; Fox just didn't take the time to use it. This has happened in the past with the Midnight Movie collection (Deranged comes to mind) but, again, the method of cutting is so bad - and the ""gruesome"" scenes the payoff for each story - that the film loses much of its enjoyment factor."
1,Crypt has a Vault Rip Off,"When I buy a movie set, I want the films to be complete and uncut. This is the case with ""Tales From The Crypt,"" but ""The Vault of Horror"" is not only cut, but the job of cutting is very bad. It really destroys the enjoyment of this film. If Fox had left the Vault DVD out of the set, I would have given them a good review, but with the cut ""Vault"" the deal is a rip off."
1,after reading reviews,"After reading these reviews on tales and vault, i WONT be buying the movie as i originally planned, I buy DVD's to get the uncut, unedited, commercial free movies. thanks for the informative reviews."
4,Tales from the Cyrpt / Vault of Horror,"This double feature was the first theatrical horror movie my mother let me attend and as a junior high student, it scared me quite effectively! Viewing it now has definite nostalgic value for me, but a warning: it's dated, campy, and very uneven, with some great episodes and some real clunkers. If you enjoyed collections such as Creepshow (1982), Cat's Eye (1985), etc., you should check out these early 1970's British offerings..."
2,an okay movie,This movie is nothing like the tv show. this movie is based on the comics that the tv show is based on. but it was horrible. the cryptkeeper was aweful. i guess i'm just to used to john kassier's cryptkeeper. i just didn't like this movie to well. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you don't
3,OK..just not one of the best of Midnite Movies features,"This one was just a big fat bore , however, its truly an interesting movies so before the HBO Tales from the Crypt..this was pretty much it. Rental only and only if you have nothing else better to do but to kill time."
2,thank god for the fox movie channle,"FMC just saved me the price of a dvd by showing this today. i was interested in buying this but in the end it is pretty lame and it was the cut version that so many are complaining about. not nearly as good as ""vault"". maybe because peter cushing is missing.but i noticed a lot of the fox midnight movies series has paired up an intersting first movie with a second of much lesser quality or which bears no relationship to the first movie.tho i do give them the props for putting ""the lodger"", ""the undying monster"" and ""hangover square"" in one great set. much better than the universal archives set that just came out. which aside from ""manmade monster"" offers only the bottom of the barrel of what is left in the universal vaults.(tho maybe not; the sequels to ""captive wild women"" are still out there) if you already own them on vhs, save your money."
2,Warning: There Are No 'Tails' In This Movie,"Oh, silly me. Today, I went to my local video store and thought that I was picking up the adult film 'Tails Getting Ripped'. When I got home, I popped the DVD in my player and after about ten minutes realized something wasn't right. Ten minutes into the movie, there hadn't been any nudity or sex. And Joan Collins was in it. Weird. So I picked up the DVD case, and saw that I had accidentally picked up the 1972 horror anthology Tales From The Crypt.On a serious note, Tales From The Crypt had its moments, but not enough of them. I was bored for the majority of its screen time. I liked the ending though, showing that good guys might finish last in this life, but bad guys go to hell in the next life. Bottom line: Creepshow, this isn't."
3,Good Comp,"This is a good compiliation of late 60'2-early 70's funk. There are some strong moments, but it's not a must have cd. Most of the songs are in the James Brown style, plus there are a few decent covers. Super Funk is a much better compiliation, as is 45 Kings. I would recommend this cd for someone that likes funk and wants to enjoy a solid, if un-essential cd."
4,Cool funk party in a box,"Not much fat or filler, and NO disco garbage. Just a bunch of hot Indiana funkmasters. Most are vocal tunes. ""The Kick"" by the Rhythm Machine stands out for its anti-drug message.(One of a few tunes with socially positive lyrics.)The title cut and ""Tighten Up Tighter"" are derived from/answer to Archie Bell & The Drells classic ""Tighten Up"" If you dig funky lead basslines and hot horns and guitars, this one's for you. The bonus cut ""Bunky's Pick"" is some kind of DJ mashup from current era. Tracks are from 1968-74, before funk was bowlderized into--you know what."
1,Why?,"Why pay upwards of 40 dollars for this EP and the other two, when you can get them off iTunes for under 5?"
1,Wretched,"This is just awful! This was a horrible movie full of inaccuracies, strange additions, nonsequential ocurrences, made up songs. There was nothing about this movie that was right. The actress was not great, the music was not Celine's. Just watching all of this transpire in English made it difficult to watch but everything was just so wrong. If you are a Celine fan and if you know ANYTHING about her please I beg you not to watch this movie. It was down right dreadful and a waste."
3,LUV CELINE!,"perhaps many inaccuracies but enough depth to portray a strong woman with God given talent and such a wonderful portrayal of dedication, perseverance, and discipline that I know is absolutely the mark of a successful woman...kudos for bringing this story to light!"
1,Worst bio pic EVER!!!!,"Any fan who says this is a must see movie must be trying to destroy Celine's career. The only reason why fans should see this movie is to trash it later on.This movie gets EVERYTHING about Celine wrong. Simple things. They have Celine singing ""If You Asked Me To"" before she was signed with Sony. Before she ever came to the US. Before SHE KNEW ENGLISH!!! They have her NOT married to Rene when she's approached to sing ""My Heart Will Go On""!!!And another thing, according to this film, Celine always knew English and she doesn't have a French accent. The makers of this film said something like ""Language doesn't matter. Celine transcends language."" Umm...NO! Celine's FRENCH language music is a HUGE part of her career and it's COMPLETELY ignored in this movie!This movie is total trash. Celine should sue.The woman who plays her can't sing worth beans either"
2,Not up to standards,"Was a little disappointed that the video kept freezing up and skipping about a fourth of the way into the video! Other than that, it was a great video."
5,One of best movies I have seen...,"I really enjoyed watching this movie 4 times now; it is very touchy! I wasn't a big fan of Celine before, now I've discovered what a marvelous singer she is. By the way, I also enjoyed to know about the way she first got involved with her agent/husband; its a beautiful love story!"
3,Great singer,"I taught the celine film was a really lovely tv movie, the acting wasn't over done. The two singers used for celine's voice were excellent, especially the older celine. Trish O'Brien's voice was fantastic and the closest thing I've heard to the real thing. If you are a fan of Celine Dion you must know this is an unauthorized film about her life and not always true in places, but it is a lovely feel good movie with great singing. I loved it.."
5,very nice album,this is a really great album.it's a perfect one for rainy days or romantic days.allot of great artists peform on this album.hear it and you will love it
3,"Not Bad, but Overpriced","I got this table because it is (1) black and (2) had the dimensions I was looking for. It requires assembly, and the instructions aren't great. It seems solid enough, and the exposed surfaces are vinyl covered for easy cleaning. This table would be good in a den or TV/Media room -- it is definitely not fine furniture. It is a bit overpriced for what you get."
2,Not so funny,"I was disappointed in the graphic novel. The first chapter or section was funny but the humor was dated. I honestly thought I was reading something for the 1990s. I read a review from the American Library Association and that's what made me decide to purchase this graphic novel. I am sad to say both the graphic novel and the association's review was disappointing. If you want to buy it go ahead, but remember the humor is dated and by the end of the graphic novel you may wish you had your money back."
5,Joyful to read for Amin,"This book, as well as ""Whatever Happened to the Egyptians"" inform, very entertainingly, about the dramatic Social and Economical changes that has taken place in Egypt since Nasser's era. They also show how the Egyptian society in some situations has been blindly moving in the direction of westernization. The book is divided into different articles, addressing different aspects of the society, eg. income, marriage, etc..., which makes it very easy and more interesting to read.I was one of Galal Amin's students in the American University in Cairo, and his very charming personality that always made his classes a joy to learn, vividly appears in his writings."
1,aweful,The safe might have been good at one time.... but it is evident that it had been used and left open and outside. The whole inside was wet and moldy.
1,Will not unlock,"We have had the chest for about 6 months now. All of a sudden, it will not unlock, regardless of which key I use. It's nice that the chest keeps things secure, but I would prefer that they not be kept secure from me."
4,As advertised!,"Exactly what I was looking for! A safe place to store important papers. Not fancy, not expensive, Just functional. As listed! I would give this product a 4 and 1/2 star rating!"
1,Leaky waterproof chest,"I bought this fire and water proof file chest in late Nov 2009. We have birth, death and marriage certificates as well as wills, SS cards and other valuable papers that we intended to put in the chest once we had them organized. In the interim we only kept the purchase info, brochures and some Christmas cards in the chest. Well we are finally organized. I pulled the box from an above grade location in our dry furnace room,opened it up and found the contents saturated with water and smelling of mold. I have no idea where the water came from but I shudder at the thought of what would have happened to all those important documents had they been in the chest. Now I'll have to see if I can find a chest that REALLY offers protection."
4,Solid product for the price,"This was exactly what I was looking for. Relatively small, but big enough for a few documents that I absolutely cannot lose.This is not a safe, its small enough that someone could carry it off if they really wanted to steal your stuff."
2,safe?,"The latch that ""locks"" the ""safe"" is hard plastic and could easily be broken with a firm tap. I don't think that they advertised correctly when they attached the word ""safe"" to it. It is a fireproof box."
1,Missing Keys,"I purchased not one, but TWO safes. Imagine my surprise when BOTH were missing keys. One, okay, snafu at the packaging department. Two, much bigger problem. Yes, both safes were missing keys. I can't rate the safe, since I'm returning it, but I'm happy to give Honeywell a black eye for this."
4,safe,"This product came very quickly, and is everything the description said it was and will work great. Although I didnt pay enough attention to the description but if I had I would have gotten a safe with a handle. Thats the only thing that could have made this product better.Thank you"
2,Heavy safe,Good safe but it is heavy and it doesn't have a carrying handle (as advertised) so it won't be that easy to move in an emergency.
2,flimsy,"I bought 2 of these, one for me and one as a christmas gift for my father. When I took it out of the box, the entire locking mechanism fell off the case and a bunch of foamy/cardboardy stuff began to crumble on the floor. I panicked thinking, how am I going to send this heavy thing back.. but I just pushed it back on and it stuck in place. The stuff that fell out must've been the fire proof material obviously, but I never expected it to just fall off like that. Well, it's no so much for locking out others, but at least it should keep things from burning in a fire. fingers and toes crossed. Also, just enough space for some important documents, but not much. I didn't expect too much since it really wasn't all that expensive. I guess it's ok for the overall cost."
1,Lock fell off when I unboxed it,This product would have gotten 0 stars if I could. When I took it out of the box and tried to use the key some plastic piece fell off and the whole lock fell apart.Don't buy this product. The Sentry is much higher quality and won't fall apart.
1,Info I should have had,"When I ordered this fire and water file chest from First Alert, it would have been helpful if I had known that every two weeks I would have to open the box for twenty minutes because of water condensation. The picture shows hanging files but in reality everything in the box needs to be in a watertight container to protect it from dampness. The importance of this was made clear by the damp, limp instruction sheet that came from inside the box."
1,Latch fell off when I opened the box,"It looks like it could be a decent product, but when I removed it from the shipping box the bottom part of the latch just came off the body (exposing the insulation inside). I returned it."
4,"Nice Safe, Poor Packaging","I really like this safe, although I agree with the others, it really isn't a safe as the locking mechanism wouldn't keep out much more than a two year old. But, the case feels super sturdy and I think it would do the job in a fire. It is VERY heavy, but I kind of expected that.Now, for the packaging... First, as I was opening the product box (i.e. not the brown shipping box), I noticed that it had been opened and re-taped at some point. When I opened the safe, everything inside was damp. Ick. Then, I turned it around and noticed one corner was smashed. As heavy as this thing is, dropping it square on one side could cause this kind of damage and Amazon just tosses it into a cardboard box with a little crumpled paper around it and sends it off. This packaging is not sufficient."
1,Safe from fire? But not from mold!,"Wow! This product is a Trojan Horse.I do not recommend anyone bring this into their home.Our Social Security cards, our Birth Certificates, or DD-214 forms, all of our important documents were placed into this safe.Several months later we opened this safe only to find all documents moist, covered in mold, and actual standing water in the bottom of the safe, STANDING WATER!!!I am not sure how well this safe would stand up to a fire, yet regardless of any fire, moisture within this safe would have destroyed the documents anyway.I suppose desiccant packets or Damp-Rid might work, but I'm not sure I am willing to take the chance again."
2,Honeywell 2037 Protector 1070-Cubic-Inch 1/2-Hour Fire Waterproof Hanging File Safe (Purchased on 10/23/2008),"Other than the fact the safe did NOT have the keys in the package that were suppose to be in there, the product and shipment was fine. Amazon could not really help me, but Honeywell responded very quickly and sent me the keys free of charge."
3,Poor packaging!,"The item itself would rate a 5, but I had to deduct two stars for Amazon's poor packing job. They used a much larger Amazon box on the outside of the product's own packaging and filled the extra space with crumpled paper. The weak Amazon cardboard arrived ripped & smashed. Inside, the product box was smooshed in on one corner and the fire safe also had a slightly smashed corner - no way to tell if it was there before the item was shipped to me or if it happened enroute. It doesn't look bad enough to compromise the integrity of the file safe, so I will pass on the hassle of trying to return it. It would have been better if they just slapped a label on the product box. The Amazon box just couldn't hold the weight of this item!"
4,If you have trouble opening the chest when you just unpack it...,"I've just received mine. One tip: If you have trouble opening the chest when you just unpack it, that's because it's un-pressurized inside. Make sure the chest in unlocked; get a soft tool like a putty knife and gently pry it open in a front corner. Don't use a sharp tool like a screw-driver or knife. Once the inside pressure is corrected, it will open just fine.As some other noted, mine was a bit damp inside. Just let it dry a couple hours before using it and put a fresh silica gel pack inside. Don't reuse a damp pack."
3,Functional but not fabulous,"This is a very simple press which makes moderately thick 6 - 6.5 inch tortillas.The process is quite simple: you make your dough, separate into small ping pong sized balls, let rest (covered) for 20 minutes or so, and press. The press does need to be hand washed and wax or parchment paper does need to be placed on either side of the dough when pressing.Tips: place dough a bit off center toward the handle and press down firmly but not so much so that you squeeze dough out of the sides of the press. Your dough obviously needs to be on the wet side (no, not too wet) to press evenly.Caveat: If you like thin tortillas this is not the press for you.In short the press works and is well made, it is a nice alternative to hand rolling when I want to make a quick batch of tortillas!"
4,Just My Size,I bought this for small tortillas and it is just what the doctor ordered.Very sturdy.Made of aluminum makes it easy to keep clean.
5,classic!,"Well, we all know that it is a must-have for all students learning regression. I just started to read it and found that it also included multilevel issues. Cool, how could these guys be so advanced years ago?"
3,"Best book out there, I guess","This book is pretty dry and boring to read as a textbook. However, I have heard that it is the best regression book out there. It has all the formulas you'll ever need. I'd recommend you have a decent foundation in statistics before you buy this book, because it will make a lot more sense if you already know the basics."
4,In-depth but easy to read,"I purchased this book to use with a grad class in multiple regression, where the syllabus follows the book closely. I don't know how easy-to-use the book would be without a supporting class, but in class and doing homework, it is extremely helpful. Carefully and plainly explains every aspect of multiple regression. Leaves out or segregates (in ""black box"" explanations) the complicated math that the computers do for us.This book does NOT include steps for using SPSS or any other stats package, but acknowledges you will be using a computer for calculation. All the better in my opinion, as it won't become obsolete after the next major software revision.This text is often cited when using multiple regression in a published study."
4,Detroit Done Boston Style!,"Montgomery is a hard blowin' harpist out of Boston. On this disc, Montgomery pays his respect to the Detroit musicians that influenced him including John Lee Hooker and various visiting musicians from Chicago like Junior Wells and Paul Butterfield. Montgomery also has James Cotton join him on two cuts, ""Smokin Blue"", an acoustic number and on Junior Well's hard edged ""Junior's Jump"". Guitarist Marc Copely, keyboardist Tom West, bassist David Hall and drummer Marty Richards provide the back beat for Montgomery's Texas tinged vocals and harp playing. The harp playing is exceptional and the rest of the band is very tight. The CD could have gotten by without Hooker's ""Dimples"", but that is a minor critisim for a surprisingly good disc."
4,Spanish Grammar for Reading,"After taking private lessons, I found this text to be an excellent segue into learning on my own. Though somewhat outdated, it does what it purports to do.If one uses the text as advised by its authors, it truly builds conversational skills and gives insights into the history and legends of the Hispanic culture.Everything I learned from this text translated very well into daily Spanish-language use."
5,Should be a classic,"Not many people seem to know about Reuben Welch, a Christian writer whose humor and tender heart make his book a wonderful, poignant call to Christian action. His illustrations of how we Christians often dump someone hurting until they've shaped up is convicting. Who have I done that to, since I know people who've dumped me because of my baggage? Welch makes me think more deeply about the grace of Christ, and the kindness I, in attempting to reflect his character, can show to others. Having the text written in a poetry layout can be distracting for some, but I found it slowed me down to think about the phrases he emphasizes by placing them alone, separate from a paragraph. Welch's matter-of-fact style, and obvious love of the Lord make this a wonderful read."
1,A terrible shame - dozens or errors make this book worthless,"I had such high hopes for this book, but reading it drove me crazy. I counted more than 50 factual errors, misspellings, grammar errors, homonym errors, misidentified songs, directors, chracters, relationships, dates -- and those are just the ones I caught. This book needs an editor and a fact checker, and the author needs to learn to spell Anne Bancroft's name, among others.It's an interesting subject, but how can you take the book seriously or trust any of its information when its riddled with mistakes? I got the impression while reading this that the author has not seen or read about many of the shows he discusses -- he couldn't have and still made those mistakes.Don't waste your money on this awful book."
3,film = 4 stars; picture/sound = 2 stars,"This is a fine film; wonderful acting. My gripe revolves around its DVD presentation. This is the 6th or 7th film (distributed by Polart) that I've seen and they are all, uniformly, quite shoddy. Polart should stop distributing these fine Polish films until they find (or can afford) the technology to do them right."
4,Solid value,"This is a well made product. It has a ""heft"" to it which is important if you have water pressure higher than 75psi. The metal hose looks good, hangs evenly right out of the box, and it is a foot longer (6') than virtually all other handhelds. The hose-to-grip connector also has an external o-ring which keeps the angle of the sprayer in place when placed in its holder. I have 75 psi and still needed to remove the flow resticter in order to get anything like the spray force I prefer. Gentle shower setting is good, but I miss having a strong, forceful, center spray. The pulsating massage settings are good, but the gentle spray/massage combo setting is worthless. High pressure mist setting is good for cleaning the shower. Despite not a having a forceful center spray this is still a solid value."
2,Imitation Metal (plastic),"After reading all of the shining five star reviews on this shiny shower head we were influenced into making this purchase. Another influential selling point on this item was the reported a ""metal hose"" and solid brass fittings. We thought, metal, now that is something rare to find in a shower head these days and especially at this price, so we went ahead with the purchase. Unfortunately, the only metal on this item are the solid brass fittings. Everything else is a chrome plated imitation of metal.We have no complaints on its ability to gush forth great torrents of water, but the dial requires Herculean strength to turn, or just very muscular thumbs."
2,Not all metal parts as stated...,"Like another reviewer, my shower head broke after only a month or so and sprayed water everywhere. The description says that this is made of metal but the piece that broke was silver colored plastic. The hose looks like it could be plastic as well but not sure about that. The shower was great until it broke. This was a gift and I was afraid to say anything till it was too late to return it to Amazon. There was no paperwork with the shower head and I am unable to find a number to contact customer service to order a new part. Can anyone help with this? I have searched the internet but without any luck."
4,"Good, not great.","Good, not perfect., April 23, 2010This review is from: Waxman 8679200 5-Spray Distinctives Handheld Showerhead, Chrome (Tools & Hardware)I bought this as a replacement for a waterpik model that I have had for at least ten years. I can't say that one works better than the other. They both have 5 settings but I only use two. The spray strength on both is good enough but niether is as strong as I would like. The Waxman looks very nice and was easy to install, it came with all needed fitting and parts however the plumbers tape was uselees - fortunatly I had my own so no harm done. Install didn't require any tools and there were no leaks - easy job. Dowside is that it does not fit very securely in my adjustable head holder. The holder is Grohe and is a universal fit. The Waxman does actually fit, but it is not a solild fit and takes some effort to make sure it is in properly."
2,Poor quality,"Installation was easy and took little time. However the base in which the shower head rests in is very unstable and the shower head shifts around in it with ease. Because of this the shower head falls out of the base very easy. If it hits anything (the tub floor, tub sides, etc.) the shower head will break. It fell once and water would leak out of the shower head making the stream extremely weak and not as designed. To start out the stream from the shower head was not all that powerful so now the shower head feels like tap water from a faucet coming over me. Very poorly put together and cheap plastic. Buy a shower head with more sturdy parts and more water flow."
4,Good basic shower spray!,This product provides a good spray on its main setting. When you change to different settings it is a bit stiff. I don't change the settings often so it's not a big deal but can't give it a 5 star because of this. Good price and delivery was prompt.
4,Good.,"It is useful enough to take showers every day. Only point I would complain is that less water comes out than I hope, especially in the middle of the shower head. But that's it. Overall it's really a good stuff."
3,Just ok...wouldn't purchase again.,"I've had this shower head for a couple of weeks now and have to say that I'm less than impressed. It looks nice but I'm not really concerned with how it looks when I'm trying to rinse shampoo out of my hair. I think the problem with this shower head (for me anyways) is that the main spray is so wide and the sprays that you can use inside of that wide spray are pretty useless. I wind up taking a longer shower trying to rinse all the shampoo out of my hair.As for the hose, it does lay nicely. It's not as long as the last one I had so when I'm giving the kids showers, I have to turn the shower off since it doesn't reach the bottom of the tub. Not a huge deal. For me, it's all about the water pressure. Guess I need more settings."
1,Don't drop it!,"I was skeptical about buying this item because the price was so low. It had great reviews, so I ordered one. It fell off the base on the first use and hit the side of the tub. Now water streams out the side of the showerhead. I'm returning it and looking for something else. Note that the showerhead base is made of chrome plated plastic, not metal."
3,Seems very durable but....,"Our previous handheld showerhead was a Moen whose dial was very easy to change settings----guess I was spoiled. We've been using this one by Waxman for a few weeks now but I'm not happy with it--my husband has no complaints at all. I have 2 complaints: 1) For me, the settings dial requires some effort to turn (I don't think anything about taking a shower should require effort. 2) There is no ""medium"" type of spray which is the best for rinsing the shampoo or soap off quickly---it's either 2 settings that are too gentle or 3 settings that beat you up. I think I might order the Peerless 76950 and transfer this Waxman to another bathroom."
3,I changed rating: Plastic holder breaks. Inferior materials.,"I'm not sure how much of it is plastic, but it seems sturdy enough and nice looking. I like the shower settings, including the mist spray. Take your time installing it after reading the directions, but it won't take long. Make sure you gets the ends of the hanging hose correctly connected. I did it wrong the first time and it took me a second try. (If not done right the shower head will not sit correctly in the holder). Nice extra long hose makes it easy for showering and spraying when hosing down the walls in the shower. UPDATE: 7/2012: Gee, maybe I actually expected this to last. While the holder has a nice chrome LOOK, it's made of cheap plastic, and it finally broke. We were able to shop the local hardware and buy a replacement holder part, this one also plastic but with the looks of chrome. For this price I really expected MORE."
3,shower head - hand held,"nice product, lightweight easy to hold. Only one complain tho, it says you get different pulse settings - but when I try the settings it will no do it. On mine it has only one setting. Disappointed in that.Nice product except for that."
2,It's leaking at spray head.,When you switch to another spray mold and it's leaking at spray head.So you have only one position can be used.
5,Pronzini Does it again!,I think this is Pronzini's best novel yet. I feel like I know the Nameless Detective personally.
3,Defective out of the box,"My TPS was glitching, so I got this one and it was defective out of the box being totaly out of range. I exchanged it at a local auto parts store and the next one worked fine. I may think twice about ordering sensitive electronc items online next time. You don't really have time to return the item when working on your car."
3,You get what you pay for,"This cot is better than sleeping on the rock hard ground. But its really difficult to assemble and its no easier when you're stuck inside a 4X4 pup tent. I'm in pretty decent shape but I can't get the dang stands to fit in the holes so I have to have someone else do it. But its cheap and works and is better than paying a boatload for something I only use once in a great while. If you are going to use it a lot, I would steer you away and invest in something higher quality."
5,Select Zakir Hussain,"Selects is more than a luminous example of Zakir Hussain'sunparallelled virtuosity. It is even more than a staggeringlybeautiful collection of rhythms and timbres that leave youbreathless waiting for the next auditory surprise. It istransportation to a musical moment filled with elements toplease and move anyone responsive to the power of music. Fordancers, this percussion masterpiece is a must. For listenersto Western Classical/Pop/Folk/Country/Rock, Indian Classical/Pop/Bollywood, North/South/East/West African, Middle Eastern,Jazz, Fusion...Selects should be owned and kept accessible.Zakir Hussain is a living treasure, and Selects proves it."
1,Not worth it,Try the Kegelmaster instead. I bought the kegel enhansor and it was a waste of money. I almost gave up hope until my husband found the Kegelmaster website. The Kegelmaster is the way to go.
2,Not not all that,"The quality was good but the songs are not mixed together, their just singles. Two of the songs sounded like they took it off the 1st Trance Global Nation because of the ending. Wel I hope the next TGN will be better then this one."
2,Different,"Blush was very different compared to other romance novels that I have read. For Sarah to have gone through the death of both parents and having to run a company, she should not have been projected so immature when it came to Bryan, she should have been a strong, more self-confident woman. She wasn't even willing to like him just because he bought her company, that was silly. For Bryan to love have loved Sarah the way it was written, you would have thought he would have told her sooner, although I understand him waiting until after she was 18 yrs. old and I guess since it seems that some men don't actually grow up until they become the age of 40, I guess that was best for them."
2,Disappointing Read!,"I have to agree with the other revewiers. This story was really unbelievable! The characters didn't act in a realistic manner. I couldn't imagine Sarah as a CEO of her company. Overall, a very disappointing read."
2,This story could have had so much potential,I agree with the last reviewer. I thought it was just me. Romantic Times gave it such a great review and then Affair de Couer gave it a bad review. I wanted to find out for myself and I have to agree with the latter. The characters acted like giddy junior high schoolers and the diaglogue was unbelievable. I under stand Ms. Wright writes children's books and has won numerous awards. Maybe she is not cut out to write in the romance genre and stick to what she does best. This was a story that could have been so much more had it been developed in a more realistic manner. This book was not up the the Arabesque line of standards.
3,takalik review,The music is very upbeat and contemporary in feel. Very young at heart and modern in its production values. Not a lot of variation in tempo and not for those wanting traditional Egyptian songs. Suitable for those wanting a taste of youthful Egyptian Pop.
2,Aria Shmaria,"I bought this because I am a Jean-Luc Ponty fan. All right I admit it- I am a completist nut. Hmmmm, over-the-top, early 70's pretentious Italian prog- with some pseudo-operatic silliness to boot. Nuff said. If that description appeals to you or you suffer from the same obsessive collector's disease as I do--than this is for you."
5,"Makes it so very, very easy.","Dealing with jewlery salespeople is like dealing with car dealers.... misearble. Using Amazon to buy the engagement ring was the best decision I could have made. Such an easy process, such a great price, and the customer service was superb. There was a slight delay in delivery (one day) and I had an email letting me know to expect the delay, and a refund of $70 for the inconvience. The ring showed up looking exactly like I thought it would, my fiance loved it, as has everyone she has shown. I would recommend getting your ring on Amazon to anyone I know."
3,pretty nice,"The diamond is great and exactly what I chose. Maybe I'm being picky, but one side of the ring is slightly wider than the other and its stamped amazon. I'm having a hard time deciding if I should return or just be happy with it. It is probably unnoticeable, but I did. I guess when I spend so much I want it to be perfect."
2,power window motors,"they do work, kit coms with everything needed to install them. The motors are weak and are not durable. After installing one of the motors seized up on me very quickly."
3,need the book,"It says on the back companion to the book, also it says or can be used on its own. Unless you allready speak some Cajun French the CD's alone wont work, I ordered them first, and now I'm waiting on the book if I would have known this I would have just ordered the book. All these CD's are is the Rev. reading the book together I'm sure it will be great but 3 stars for getting dooped."
4,Cajun Self-Taught : Learning To Speak The Cajun Language,I have really enjoyed reading and learning the language.I would recommend this book to anyone interested. I strongly suggest the audio tapes also.
2,Slow delivery,"The item itself is fine as described. However, the item was purchased 2 weeks before Christmas as a Christmas gift and was received the week AFTER Christmas. I even sent an email the week it was due to come in because I was concerned that the tracking had not shown any activity for over 7 days. I was told that it should be there on time. But it wasn't."
4,Louisiana Grammie,"Cajun is a very hard language to learn. Unless you were raised around the Cajun language I find it almost impossible to learn to speak fluently. Father Daigle did an excellent job with the book, CD and dictionary. If you are very dedicated to learning this would be very beneficial."
5,Cajun Self Taught,"Great method of relearning cajun french. It's helpful when used. I've started calling my grandma in southern LA to practice. Teaches common phrases, an inventory of home-related terms, and best of all cajun food. Highly recommended!."
4,Great Product,"This product does what it says it will do. Speedy charge, no overcharging. It works great."
1,Junk,Got what I paid for -- could not insert into phone. Either something broke or item arrived defective. So what does one do with a penny item?
4,credit,in fact this company sent me the wrong charger and has now promissed to reimburse me the full cost without me retruning the charger since the item is only valued at 3+ dollars. I have yet to see the credit but I belive them.
4,Good Book,"I enjoyed this book. I actually bought multiple copies for Christmas gifts, because it is a quick, good read for anyone."
2,Not that good,"This book is not really that good of a guide. Very simplistic in approach and mostly common sense. Their guide seems to be geared towards educational program start-ups and nothing else. If you are in the biomedical sciences, this book is a waste."
5,Great book,"This is a great book, and has helped me a lot in school with the grant writing. Glad I purchased."
5,Very Nice,"I decided on this new style pen case as I bought two Cross pens for a friend and wanted to give her pens some protection from scratches, etc. When I got the case I was very impressed with the quality of the leather, the fitment of the snaps and the flap that comes down over the tops of the pens. When storing the pens be sure to turn the clip on the left hand side pen to the left and the right hand side pen to the right. This will provide a flatter surface and allow the top snap to be easily done. I can see from the photo that the pens are being shown with the clips straight up. That was not a very good position for the two pens I purchased. In any event, I recommend this case highly and the price is very competitive, especially compared to Pelikan and Montblanc cases."
3,Temporary TENT,This should be used for a party-setting. You just use it for a few hours. The Wind tore it up.
5,unbelieveable new sounds,"after listening to this Cd, I was totally captivated by the group's use of sample overlays and funky beats. I've played it over and over, but I am still ahving trouble classifiying their sound. At points the group takes me through spooky interludes, into total sound mayhem. I highly recommend this Cd for anyone looking for something new and different in the music world. It is unlike anything I've heard before."
4,Leaders Have High IQs,"No doubt the author was correct when he penned the thought ""leaders have a high implementation quotient."" This is a great analogy and take away point from this quick read book. Some of the most eefective leaders I know do not have a title. They work in the nitty gritty daily grind and influence others to get things done. Mr. Sanborn is right! ""You don't need a title to be a leader."" I would add that followers almost always focus on the talent of our leaders to inspire us to achieve great outcomes."
1,I dissagree with Mark Sanborn...,"The information is good. Where I disagree is that most people reading and writing reviews are LEADERS WITH TITLES. It is true you can be a leader without a title, but YOU WILL NOT GET PAID if you don't have the title. I believe in paying professionals WELL. I do not believe we should pay as little as possible and expect greatness to be FREE. I could go on and on, but I won't ... My advice, be a leader BUT DON'T DO IT FOR FREE."
5,Mark Sanborn has done it again!!!,"A must read for anyone who wants to make a positive difference, a much written about subject written with Mr Sanborn's unique ability to make it all so easy to understand. Be sure to have that marker handy.read it once in just an hour or so, and then read it again"
4,Includes some great content for motivating others to lead.,"I used this book to gather ideas for motivating my employees to be leaders. Overall, the book had some good concepts and ideas that I found useful. Best bet, find it at a local bookstore and preview it before purchasing it at Amazon.com."
4,Important information for people that think they are unimportant.,Good & easy read with only 102 pages. Common sense information put into a readable form.
4,kinda interesting,"Vince Edwards sings like he wanted to be called by the Rat Pack if anything ever happened to Sammy Davis Jr. Try his ""Live at the Riviera Hotel"" and ""Vincent Edwards Sings"" albums too. Too bad he was not around to dub Junior Soprano's singing. Coulda been like Travolta in ""Pulp Fiction."" Well worth investgating if you like vocal standards."
5,My Ferret loves this,This is my ferret's favorite treat and my friend says that it is her ferrets favorite as well. :) He turns his nose up at other treats that I try to give him....he holds out until I give him his banana raisin treats.
2,Won't work in Windows Vista,"I have been using this program for many years. It is so easy to use, has lots of graphics & will import many other graphics. I have loved it. However, there are 2 major problems.1. When I upgraded to PA 2003, they changed the format completely. I didn't mind having to learn a totally new program. But it would not transfer my PA4 documents to the new format. Since I had scads of business docs, I had to continue using PA4. I dropped a note to Sierra, but they did not even answer me. When I changed to Windows XP, it started having many irritating problems that I learned to live with, including crashing. So I had to save often.2. This is the biggest kicker. Last week I got a new laptop which has Windows Vista on it, PA4 would not even install. I am in a real bind! I have to upgrade & do every single doc over, one by one. So if you have any intentions of ever upgrading, DON'T buy PA4!"
3,Was pretty good back on 2000 if not a bit buggy.,"This was my first version of Print Artist back in 2000.While it was somewhat buggy, it was a bit less so than the old Print Master program and 1/10 the cost of REAL programs.The biggest problem was that it would spontaneously stop working with my printer.If you are running an old Windows98 machine and you can't get hold of an old MS Publisher or anything else, this works okay."
5,A Must See Movie,"Ioan Gruffud IS Horatio Hornblower, to a fault-even as a lean, mean sea captain. His shocking good looks make him an instant HIT. But blimey! He marries his landlady's daughter Maria? I half expected the bloke to marry a demure lovely Keira Knightley type. His ladylove is at least 8 years his senior, and perhaps this explains his desperation to return to the briny deep! Besides Ioan, another hero in this movie is GREG WISE-- as a French turncoat his acting was STUPENDOUS. Good job Greg!"
1,Poor Picture Quality,"Though these two new episodes are in Widescreen Anamorphic 1.78:1 format, the picture quality is very poor when compared to my other Hornblower DVDs. What actually happened is that these episodes were filmed in 4:3 aspect ratio (full screen), then chopped up and the resulting image enlarged to artificially make them ""widescreen"" i.e 1.78:1 ratio. Not very clever. All this results in a very unsatisfactory picture quality not to mention the faces of the actors sometimes partly cut in close up scenes. Did A&E really think customers wouldn't notice? But I guess filming in widescreen from the beggining would cost more. I'm very dissapointed."
4,Horatio Hornblower swashbuckler,The adventure continues at full gale force wind carrying the viewer along as another two adventures unfold with the very handsome Horatio. The intensity of the first stories again keeps the viewer entranced and entertained. Well worth watching--several times.
2,NOT C. S. FORESTER,"Previous episodes of this series did make some attempt at compatibility with the books of C. S. Forester. At least, enough of the characters and story line were present so that the books could be recognized.No more. Extremely little C. S. Forester material remains in ""Duty"" and ""Loyalty"". The story lines are nothing like anything I read in the books. The characters are ludicrous. Here we have Hornblower portrayed more as leader of a boys club than captain of a man of war circa 1800.I thoroughly enjoyed the films but as adaptations, they are failures."
4,Hotspur of an adventure,"Another of A&E's made for TV versions of the Hornblower saga. This time Hornblower and the Hotspur are divided into two films and have quite a bit of new material added. I love the Hornblower sagas of adventure, loyalty, seafaring and duty. I don't really appreciate adding so much of the spies, land battles, and nonsense that the TV producers have included. Perhaps their production is better suited to filming on land. Shipboard life would undoubtedly be hard to film. However, one of the best parts of the Hornblower adventures is the life on board a navy ship at sea, with all its crowding, smells, hardship, poor food, worse water, and risk of death. It's a rollicking good yarn, and does have the flavor of Hornblower on the Hotspur, but leaves out more than it adds. Good film, but not as good as if they had stuck more to the original adventures."
1,Doesn't keep accurate time,"If you actually need to time something to the minute, don't buy this product. You can't line it up accurately, and when you do, it is very inconsistent.I should have gone digital - but I wanted soemthing my kids would be able to set too."
1,Used,I was charge for a new product but I received a used product with some of the number writen in and to make matter worse I could not even make out the writen in number.
2,Difficult to use,"This timer is NOT a good timer if you want exact times. It's hard to set it for an exact amount of time, and because of the amount of 'wiggle room' the top part has, even if you think you've got an exact time, it's probably not right.A good, cute timer if you want a general idea of how long you're baking something for, but not if you want to put your cookies in for exactly 8 minutes.Also-- I don't think the instructions mentioned this, but you need to turn the timer past 30 before setting it for a time under 30."
3,Beware of the stay cool handles,"Overall, this is a very good set. I bought it at a great price and it is easy to clean and heats quickly and evenly.I read another review that said the claimed ""stay cool"" handles worked for them. I don't know if they bought a different set or not, but my handles DO NOT stay cool at all. To pick up the pots by the handles are as bad as grabbing the pot and picking it up. My husband and I have both burned hands, thinking that the stay cool advertisement really worked. So, use caution when touching them for the first time if you choose to buy this set!"
3,Good protection,Cool stuff... The problem is after the first game it scratch a lot and looks very old... The inside protection destroyed before i wear them
1,Don't waste your time,"The book is a lot of fluff surrounding two very basic messages: 1)Take one gram of chitosan for every five grams of fat you don't want to be absorbed, and 2)follow a high-fiber, low-fat diet to lose weight. The former is readily available info that you could get at a health-food store or on the web, the latter is common sense. I can't vouch for Chitosan's weight-loss benefits (I have a few colleagues who swear by it, and they're pretty stable folks, so...), but I recommend you buy a good book about basic nutrition instead of this one...you'll learn more and will be able to apply it to your lifestyle more constructively."
3,gives nutritional downside of many popular diets,"The idea of ""dieters beware"" below is that I actually liked the chapter of the book with that same title, which somehow got omitted from my review below. It gives you the nutritional downside of numerous popular diets that you probably won't get in the books that promote or endorse those diets. This knowledge could be quite useful even if you do not choose to go with the chitosan plan. You should keep in mind however that the information does appear to be slanted in favor of high carbohydrate diets, and attacks extra fat in food as being the main source of our nutritional problems, whereas most sources I have read agree that excess energy is stored in our bodies as fat regardless of what type of food the energy derives from."
3,"""dieters beware""",The basic idea of the fat blocker diet is to take the supplement chitosan before meals to absorb a high percentage of fat so that you do not end up ingesting it in the first place. The plan also calls for a high-carbohydrate/low-protein/low-fat diet. The book focuses on establising good eating habits for life and is not supposed to be a fad diet that you will abandon in a few weeks or months.END
3,"Great Philosophy Book, but kinda ""so so"" as a Golfer's Book","I used to golf from time to time with Leland Lewis, (Tao of Golf author) back in the 1990's. Although I liked him, enjoyed his company, and was amazed by the way he struck a golf ball, I really didn't agree that much with his ideas in this book. Such as ""just purely enjoying the game of golf,and the beauty of nature, without so much preoccupation on the final score"". It seemed kind of unrealistic to me. Most golfers gauge their ability upon the score and not upon whether they felt in harmony with their surroundings. It was a very good book about Taoism and Eastern Philosophy, but as a golfing book, for me, it was just okay...."
1,Horrible,"Ill-written vanity nonsense, Mr. Lewis is a thief, a scammer out to cheat you of your time. Don't waste a minute on this garbage, get a copy of Good Walk Spoiled or anything by Arnie Palmer."
4,djs comments,"I haved enjoyed the CD from the first playing.Philip Smith is truly a wonderful trumpet player.I recomend this CD to any trumpet player who wants to improve there solo style.The recording though, is on the brite side. Typical of many digital recordings.If you are a trumpet student, you need this CD."
4,Great example of obscure Heavy Seventies Hard Rock!,"1973 hard psyche-style rock from Iceland. Heavy on the spooky factor, atmosphere plays a defining role in describing these guys, (in case the frozen skeletons dancing around a cross-shaped headstone didn't tip you off.)Virtually no one I've ever met knows who these guys are. If anyone ever reads this and is considering buying this CD, you will probably be the only person you know with a copy of this if you do.Unless you know me, of course."
2,Wish I had passed this up,Listening to 30 second clips really can't give you a feel for an albumn. The songs are just too repeatitive to really get into for me. I'd pass on it if given a second chance.
4,What Price Israel,"This is one of the best books written about the birth of the State of Israel. I reada it when I was writing my graduate thesis, many years ago. I bought it to give to a friend who is interested in the subuject.Samira Baroody"
1,unhappy customer,"customer beware - you try to buy Siemens breaker - what they send you is Murray breaker which is not even compatable with Siemens panel - good luck in arguing about this, as they say that on the bottom page it says Murray - if that is not misleading I do not know what is!!!!!!!!!!Richard below is link on the product<...>"
2,Very Frustrating!,"I bought this tub toy for my 18 month old... I thought it looked cute - it was something different! But I must say, it's very frustrating. The toy has to be mostly submerged in the water it to fill up and to use the pump. If you have water in it, lift it out of the water, all the water drains out and you cannot pump the water out. Of course, it's hard to tell a 18 month old that it must be half-way submerged for it to work. I'm planning on tossing this toy out! Don't waste your money on this one... unless you purchasing it for a much older child. By the way, I tried using it myself and I really had to pump like crazy to make it work."
3,Cute but hard to push,"My kindergarten daughter will probably enjoy this more as she gets older, mainly because it takes some strength to hold the pump with one hand and push it with the other. The child also has to understand how to put it under water to fill it. It's fun, but the pump is a little tricky."
1,"Put the ""travel"" back in travel writing","I bought Pets Welcome, but after using it I have the impression that the authors didn't travel at all to write it. We traveled to inns that didn't reflect the descriptions at all. The Fish's reviews are essentially taken from the brochures, with perhaps one or two additional facts. I can read a brochure or check a web site for the innkeeper's perspectives, but I depend on travel guides for firsthand experiences of the authors. I was dissapointed with Pets Welcome guide because it merely pointed me in the right direction without giving me any insight."
4,for pinnacle drum &bass get this,"From someone who wasn't into repz' new lp. This is probably the best drum and bass album out now. It is very smooth, underground, and quality. Die's is the best contribution the the through the eyes series. But for someone who is not into drum and bass- You would have to hear it first. And you can listen to a ten minute exerpt from the album on full cycles web site, dj die in the mix"
3,Aereogramme+isis,Im a huge fan of aereogramme.A semi-fan of isis(they are great when they want to be it seems)but this ep is overpriced and not that great.def. check out aereogramme though b/c they are an amazing group that sadly are no longer...
3,oh god.......,"Sorta tedious, tolerable. Isis definently lost thier edge over the years. i can wash dishes to this."
4,FAST AND SWEET,"This trio make an ungodly racket. This album is a really good workout in agressiveness and brutality. Fast guitar playing and even faster drumming added with venomous vokills and that is what this sounds like. Also there are no guitar solos on this album. The only referance point on their sound MAY be a garage version of THE HAUNTED. Good album overall, a band with a great future."
1,A sad corruption of history,"Poorly researched, poorly writen, this could have been a great book. It deals with two interesting and misrepresented characters, but in a way that sheds no new information or insight into the men or the time they lived in. A great many factual errors in the book."
3,"very worn, but I knew that before I bought it","I ordered this (it's been 5 years, now) for a big 40th Anniversary party I was throwing for my parents. I ordered several older magazines and books from the era for the guests to browse through.It was quite worn and had to be handled carefully, but it was described as such before I bought it."
2,Weston Fruit and Wine Press,I purchased the Weston fruit press an was not impressed with the design. The ratchet mechanism only advances 1/4 inch per ratchet. (Does not work like the ratchet in wrenches). The stacking blocks skews when the ratchet comes in contact with stacking blocks. Having a second round wood disk that sets atop the stacking block would eliminates the skewing. If your are doing a small batch you will need additional blocks to efficiency squeeze the juice out.
2,I wish I could return it.,"I did not fully understand the limitations of a fruit press with a single screw rod in the center. The fruit must be put in 2-3 bags and placed around the rod rather than all the fruit being placed in one bag. I didn't feel as if the fruit was completely pressed (all juice removed). I'll keep a look out for a fruit press with two screw rods, one on each side of the press and outside of the area where the fruit bags are placed. If anyone wants to buy a once-used Weston Fruit and Wine Press please let me know. (509) 335-6294"
4,Apple Season,"The fruit press is of very nice quality, however, as indicated by some of the reviews it does take a bit of time to learn how to operate it most efficiently. Once we got that part down, we were fine. Don't be impatient. We were able to extract quite a bit of juice out of the apples in order to make an apple wine. We plan on using it more next year. For the price I think this is a good buy."
1,Rick,"I found this press to be hard to use,did not press all the juice out , and awkward. I had to re-design it and weld on to it to become an actuall press. now it works like a press should!"
2,Hard to use!,Tried to press muscadine grapes that were very ripe. Lots of cranking without much juice. Might work ok if fruit were completly crushed before hand.
1,"Cheap, not worth your cash","Lot's of parts that are easy to lose. The technique of using the blocks is a pain to say the least. The bolts on the rings holding the wood come out easily, the whole contraption is constructed as if just enough to keep it together. I was surprised to see a reviewer call it ""well-made"" and ""sturdy"". Nothing could be further from the truth. Your best bet is to a get an antique one on craigslist or ebay. They are made with cast iron, come with a crusher and will last you a lifetime and can be passed on to your children (you'd be lucky to have this 5 years). You can get them for only about 50-100 more dollars. Much more worth it."
1,Tribal Fusion Fundamentals,I can't find anything nice to say about this DVD..There was one part where the music was so loud it seemed like I was fighting to hear what the instructor was saying...I took it out of the player and haven't thought about it since...I will up date this reveiw if I decide to take another look....
3,Decent dvd,"i didnt buy this for a long time becuase of some of the reviews i have seen but i like this dvd! other bellydance superstar dvds are definitley better than this one BUT as a dancer of almost 5yrs(on and off i must admit) i found morias layering section challenging but in a good way! samanthas cymbal section is GREAT if your a *beginner*, sherrys floorwork section is my 2nd favorite part of this dvd! kamis is too short and not challenging...so in the end 2/4 sections i liked, its a okay dvd."
2,the solo's are nice,The solo's are nice but if you haven't had any dance experience this isn't the dvd for you. It's like BBSS are getting to commercial and just randomly coming up with below par dvds.
1,Winfax trouble,"I have been using this product since winfax lite, (around 1995). Back then, windows was not as extensive and burdened with drivers and registry files. In theory, this is an excellent program, allowing an orderly record of all of your faxes ever sent. The unfortunate reality, is that this program will make your Windows PC behave as if it has a virus, and you will spend enormous amounts of time trying to find a virus and attempting to figure out why the system crashes whenever you try to do anything, most noteable, Microsft Word, and Dragon Naturally Speaking. Very few if any T/S people will be able to find a problem."
4,Bye Bye Winfax Pro,This has been a great product through the years. Unfortunately Symantec has decided in their stupid wisdom to discontuinue it. It will not work under Vista. On to something better!
1,You can't divorce this product,"I had an earlier version, 9.0. Couldn't use it on XP. Wanted to upgrade to 10.0. Had to remove 9.0. Meanwhile, WinFax wouldn't let me get to my email. It inserted random crashes into Word and Dragon. And above all, wouldn't let me delete the program or its parts (I still have most of them) without going into the registry, and that's another dreadful story. I finally learned that 9.0 won't work with XP, nor will it work with broadband. From its history and my experience, I suggest that only masochists install any version of WinFaxPro."
4,panic- hardcore,"The other reviewer seems to have a lot of un-funny inside jokes going on! This CD is awesome. just straight up hardcore punk rock. The wierd sounds are kind of annoying but this band rocks! One problem is this cd is too short, but at least it is longer than their second release. They should have combined the two as a full length cd. IT would probably have sold better! Strong release!"
3,8 Carmel does it again!,"Well they aren't the first or the best band to ever have members from 8 Carmel St. But at least they won't be the last.Weird layout and weird noises at the end of the record complement what the band is going for here.special note: Jason Correia used to be in this band, but was kicked out.""THIS ONE'S FOR WES! ITS HIS BIIIIRFFDAYYYYY!""""WE'RE PANIC AND WE'RE FROM PHILLY!"""
4,Just beginning?,"A great read for anyone just getting into the Craft,or researching it to see if it fits them. I found it very informative."
1,Same old Same,"Usualy books get better the more an author writes. This just repeats what the author has said many times before, material that is mostly dated and a bit silly as a new title on the subject. If you already own the Big Blue, dont bother with this one as you already own an introduction to the basics of Wicca. If you don't already own the Big Blue, buy it instead."
4,Good Transaction,This book arrived in good time and in great shape. I love Raymond Buckland and was glad to be able to add this to my collection. The seller did a wonderful job packaging it to get it to me. I would buy from them again.
5,The only way to prep,"This book is the only prep book I've seen that takes a positive look at taking the SAT. It doesn't scare students by painting the test as a monster they have to duck in order to get into college, but instead as a tool to HELP get into college."
4,An Entertaining Book about the SAT,"I am a full-time SAT tutor. I find most of my students enjoy this book very much. A few do not. Overall, I think it is valuable (it is definitely entertaining) for students. I have found, however, that there are a couple of questionable reviews in the book. For example, there is a review on avoiding split infinitives. I have been through over 20 SATs and a handful of PSATs and have never seen split infinitives tested. Besides, most scholars believe that the split infinitive is acceptable as all the greatest authors (from Shakespeare to Maya Angelou) have used them. Students will read this book, not just for the content, but because they will be wondering what the wacky authors will write next."
5,"RE: Maitre Chef, the best cookware value on Amazon","I plan to purchase a set of this cookware in the future based on the great reviews.Regarding the reviewers whose cookware sustained heat damage here is the Master Cookware/Maitre Chef contact information:Master Cookware2045 South Arlington Heights #115Arlington Heights, IL 60005Phone: 847-439-4360Fax: 847-439-4530Hope this helps the other Maitre Chef reviewers whose cookware has been heat damaged to obtain replacement parts!Thank you, Amazon!Regards.Jim"
3,Maitre Chef was attractively priced.,"We needed a new set of cookware and had considered another brand but it was hard to pass up the low price of the Maitre Chef, about half of similar products. My wife likes the glass tops and stick-free surface and they clean up easily. We have had an unexpected problem with the 1 qt. pan in that it became slightly out of round so the top no longer fits. It has been used on the surface burners but on one occasion placed in a warm (200F) oven to keep the contents warm while cooking something else. The directions say that it is warranted up to 350F but it has never been placed in an oven that hot. We are disappointed and would like to find the manufacturers e-mail or telephone for a replacement."
3,ok for the price,"bought this stand just so it would be easier to tear apart my ls2 shortblock. THE only thing i don't like about it is that there is too much slack when you put the locking pin in. It's around 3/8"" of slack...so to remedy this I drilled to holes on each side and welded a 3/8"" nut on each side and tighted a bolt to lock it up. this is my first engine stand so maybe all of them have some kind of slack but I feel better knowing I don't have any slack."
3,Ok for the price,"This stand is ok for the price. Wheels could be bigger for easier rolling, but for $50 it holds my engine fine."
5,Great Collection of Bechet,"Finally, we have all of Sidney Bechet-Muggsy Spanier Big Four recordings on CD! That alone makes this CD collectible. In addition, there are two of his Bechet One-Man Band recordings, in which Sidney plays several instruments in addition to the soprano and clarinet (priceless). Art Hodes' Blue Note Jazzmen, featuring Wild Bill Davison, also make this a good selection. Some of the other recordings are O.K. at best--such as Bob Wilbur's Wildcats (Bechet's student)."
1,If you like to eat leather.,"I tried giving this Fish Jerky a chance, but it was just to hard. It takes about five minutes to chew just a tiny piece. The only thing near to describing how tough this horrible tasting Jerky is. Have you ever bought the big piece of rawhide bone you get for your dog. I suggest if you like your teeth and want to avoid jaw pain, ""DON'T BUY THIS ITEM"""
3,Great Concept but....,"Hello friends,Huge fan of Spidey when I was a kid. And now I bought the DVD for my kid son.I am impressed with the animation and the action in the cartoons of the DVD.The reasons why I did not give it 5 stars is because:The cartoon is not made for kids. I was shocked to hear offensive words like ""Hell"" and ""Cra*"".What are we teaching our children, that it is ok for them to speak like that since their heroes are saying that?What happened to the classical good vs. evil cartoons.Thanks,Nawaf"
1,Disappointment,"My son is a big Spiderman fan and so I ordered this new Animated Series. He told me upon viewing it, that this was computer-animated. I think it stinks and if I had known this before I opened it, I would have returned it and got my money back!!! Give me the old animation any day!"
3,Shiny and sparkly but ring size not accurate,"I think this ring is just okay. The size 5 I ordered feels like a size 6. The side stones are sparkly, but feel scratchy. The pearl is button shaped, and white, not grayish as in the picture. It looks shinier than the picture. Too bad it can't be resized. The promotional discount and free shipping was a good deal at the time.However, should anyone choose to return the merchandise, you might not receive a full refund. This company will charge you for the shipping cost to you and from you! Also, should you give them a review and/or rating that is 3 star or lower, they might email you to get you to change it!"
5,Also good for weighing produce for recipes,"I had changed the food that I fed my cats and they both gained weight over the year. The vet stressed that this was not good. Got this scale which is easy to use and I feel accurate. One of the cats just lays down and purrs, while the other fidgets but I can still get his weight. And seriously, I do use the scale when a recipe calls for 1 or 2 pounds of something, when I forget to weigh at the grocery."
5,Very pleased with this product.,Baby scale met or exceeded all my expectations. Very accurate and easy to use.
5,Great product!,I purchased the scale for my twins and i love it. The fact that it converts into a toddler's scale too is awsome. Good quality for a very good price. Thanks!!!
5,Great scale,We rented a scale for a month from my lactation consultant. Once we returned I went looking for one online. I loved this scale. It's not as nice as the rented one but that one costs almost $[...]k's. This one works just fine for trying to best guess the amount my daughter has taken in from breast milk.
1,Never shows the correct weight!,"This scale is defective! From day one it has shown us a wrong weight for our 4 month old son. We bought it cause he was not putting on enough weight and we wanted to monitor his weight form home. Everytime we weighted him at home we were so happy to see that he has put on weight, but when we went to his pediatrician we were shocked to see that actually he was more than a pound off. We have always weighed him at home just before going to the pediatrician to compare what the difference may be so we can account for it, but it is never consistent! Sometimes it is more than a pound off sometimes more and sometimes even less. I have not contacted customer service as yet but will do so soon. My advice don't buy this scale."
2,Don't believe the hype,"We really wanted a scale for our baby to measure her weight gain. After reading the reviews, we thought we found the best scale at a fair price. But, the scale proved to be very inaccurate. One day, she was gaining and then the next day she lost weight. We were worried about it, so went to the doctor and found out she had indeed gained 3 ounces. This big a discrepency for a newborn is unacceptable. So, be careful when you buy this item."
5,Accurate!,"My wife and I were looking for a good baby scale since our 1st kid had a problem with weight gain. She was hesitant on getting this scale and wanted a $1,000 doctor's office type baby scale.I'm glad I saw the great reviews that this scale is getting. After buying this scale, we compared its measurements to what the pediatrician's office scale measured. The difference was usually around 1-2 ounces. So we're very happy with it.On a side note, the baby tray easily removes by using a coin to turn the plastic screw. When the tray is removed, there's an odd Mickey Mouse look-alike face for toddlers to see when they step on the scale themselves."
4,"Good scale, not returnable","Overall a good scale. Gives weight in lb/oz. easy to assemble. The only downsides are that it doesn't ever ""settle"" on a weight, which makes it tough when you've got a wriggling baby on there. Also, there was a sign on the box that said that once opened, the scale could not be returned. That seems absurd to me... If I wasn't happy with the scale, I would have been pissed."
3,It's just okay,Purchased this for my grandson who is very underweight. He's just a year old and sits on the scale. The weight fluctuates almost the whole time he is on it. He doesn't sit still all of the time so I guess that dosen't help. But I'm not really sure what weight to take. It goes up and down 4 or 5 ounces. I guess I expected it to only fluctuate an ounce and not bounce all over. He is just starting to stand up alone and maybe it will be better if I can stand him on it.
5,Great little scale,"I got this scale to weigh puppies with when my dogs produce, and have used it with my current dogs and it is the perfect size for small dogs. I like the choice that if you are weighing something and want to lay it on perhaps a blanket, that you can put the blanket on the scale and zero out the scale and then put whatever you are weighing on the scale and get the correct reading."
5,Very Nice Scale,"We had originally purchased a cheaper scale that was not digital. I used it a few times and it was very hard to get an accurate reading. I took it back and bought this one instead. It is wonderful! It automatically sets itself to zero when it's turned on. If you want to weigh the baby with a diaper on, you can weigh a spare diaper and the scale will off-set to make up for the additional weight. It's amazing to see how fast my son is growing. It does convert to a toddler scale when the child is able to stand."
1,useless for breastfeeding,"i bought this scale spacifically for breastfeeding to weigh my son after every feeding as wanst gaining well and i wasnt sure he's getting enough milk. as it turns out, the scale can show results different by up to 2 oz!!!! when i weigh my baby twice at the same time or it shows that he weighs LESS after a feeding than before. it's a big deal when u need to know whether ur baby got the amount of food he needs. unfortunately u cannot return the scale once its unpacked."
5,Excellent scale for Newborn,"I bought this scale because I like to keep track of my son's weight. My wife and I weigh him every Saturday morning and keep track of this like my mom did when I was born.The scale is very easy to use and prompt with the results as well. I like the fact that you can put they baby on their, weigh him and press ""hold"" and take him off the scale before he starts getting to annoyed of lying on it. Once he is up in my arms again, I can get the results of the display and put it on the sheet for tracking.The scale also lets you put clothes and diapers on beforehand to ""zero out"" the added weight and you'll only get the true weight of the child.I appreciate the fact of being able to switch back and forth between grams and ounces since I am European and want the metric weight but my wife, being American wants the weight in ounces."
4,weighing in...,"This digital scale is used to weigh my cats. After each visit with my vet, I weigh them once I return home as a way to confirm its' accuracy. It has a nice large readout, making it easy to see the numbers. The 'baby' tray makes it easy, since they will settle in and get comfy, allowing me to get an accurate reading. It weighs up to 44 pounds by .5 ounce increments, so I can even keep an accurate weight on my new kitten."
5,Good Baby Weighing Scale,"My wife and I were looking for a weighing scale for our infant son, who had weight gain issues in the first year of his life. It was not always practical (or economical) to go to the pediatrician's office for a weight check, so we decided to buy a scale for tracking his weight at home. We have compared the scale reading with that at the pediatrician's office on a subsequent visit to the doctor, and the margin of error was less than 0.2 ounces...very much acceptable. Moreover, if we track his weight by this scale, the margin of error is irrelevant, as long as the scale works perfectly.It is easy to stow away in the cabinet by simply taking the tray off. We normally do not put the tray locking pin in, to allow for easy storage.The build looks sturdy too. Overall, very satisfied with the ease of use and features (converts to a toddler scale over time)."
5,Just what we wanted!,"We bought this scale to help us keep track of our newborn. She was having a hard time gaining weight, and since we are traveling a lot it didn't work out for us to keep going to the doctor's for weight checks. So we can put her on the scale whenever we need to make sure she is putting on weight. We can also call the doctor and update him on her weight. It's been a huge help for us."
5,Great for Cats,I bought this scale to weigh my cats. I have a few special needs cats and needed to keep an eye on their weight. This scale works great. Should have bought one a fews years ago. It saves me a trip to the vet everytime I think they have dropped a few pounds.
4,Good product for breastfeeding baby,"I bought this product after finding out that my newborn wasn't gaining enough weight. It's close to accurate compared to the doctor's office scale. Now I can weigh my daugther with a piece of mind instead of waiting a month to find out if she gained weight or not. The lactation nurse that came to see my daughter liked the scale, too. The gram function is really helpful for nursing. I use it every day to weigh her and I am able to get an estimate of how much she eats by using the gram feature. And I like how I can use it to weigh my 2 1/2 year old son too!"
1,Not Accurate: Inflates Weights by over 11 Percent,"We purchased this scale to carefully track our newborn's weight and were initially very happy with how much weight he had gained and how easy this scale was to use. The first doctor's appointment weigh-in was about a pound less than the measurements we were getting from our new scale, but we chalked it up to an anomaly or minor differences between the scales. However, after the second doctor weigh-in was off by nearly two pounds, we decided to test out the accuracy of the scale with some basic household products.Four pounds of sugar weighed 4 lbs, 7 1/2 oz (4.5 lbs). Five pounds of flour weighed 5 lbs, 9 oz (5.6 lbs). Nine pounds of combined flour and sugar weighed 10 lbs, 0 oz (10.0 lbs).Bottom line: this scale appears to inflate weight amounts by over 11 percent on a fairly consistent basis. We will be returning it right away."
2,Difficult to clean,"I bought this scale for a small animal exam room. From the picture, I couldn't tell what the circular designs on the platform were. Ability to disinfect is of prime importance in my setting. Since other animal care groups said they loved the scale, I figured the circular 'designs' couldn't be holes. They are. The platform has 4 separate circular 'designs' composed of full thickness holes to the bottom of the platform. This is extremely unfortunate. As you can imagine, hair, skin flakes, flea feces, etc all falls into these holes, as would diarrhea, fungal spores, products of a sneeze or cough, etc. To disinfect completely between pets one must use Q-Tips. I don't know what other animal care facilities that 'liked' this product were thinking unless these holes are a new feature. This would be OK if you were buying this for home use but not in a facility that sees multiple animals and requires cleanliness."
5,"Prompt delivery, good quality product","We received the scale on time as promised and it has been working without any problem. It's very precise, has a nice design and our baby seems to find it comfortable."
3,Not what I expected.,"No real complaints with the scale itself, it ultimately did not meet my needs. So I returned it for credit. Amazon has a great return policy!!!"
5,Resolved my worries,"When I became concerned that my daughter (my seventh child) wasn't gaining weight like my other babies did, this item resolved my concerns. I could weigh her before and after nursing and see the difference. I soon realized that though she was small, she was getting plenty to eat and was gaining weight steadily. Since she crawled (6.5 months) and walked (10 months) on time, and met all her other milestones, and was gaining at least some weight, I had peace of mind. (Her head circumference and height have always been normal--she was just really thin.) She's now almost 13 months and doing great. I still weigh her periodically to see where she's at. I like that the scale can adjust to a regular scale now that she's growing older."
3,So far so good,This scale came in handy for me when I really needed to weigh my newborn frequently. The fact that it does ounces and pounds is great. It stores away pretty easily. My baby is still young so haven't used the toddler function though I assume it would be just fine.
4,"Great scale, very precise","Amazon has the best price on this scale and very fast shipping. The scale is very precise. For instance, I measured my baby before a feeding and she was 7 pounds and 15 ounces, she then ate 3.5 ounces and after a feeding, she measured 8 pounds and 2.5 ounces, you cannot get more precise than that. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because I think the scale should have some soft cushion to put the baby on which is not factored into the baby's weight."
5,Salter914 Scale,"Bought it for my daughter, she loves it it is always in use between her toddler and baby.It helps her to keep a good diary of how her kids grow and her toddler loves to be just like mommyso copying the weight check keeps her considering her food choices."
5,infant and toddler scale,The scale works wonderful. I love the ability is has to place a blanket on the scale for an infant and zero the weight out so you can get an acurate weight of the baby. Would highly recommend this scale to anyone with small children.
4,Easy to use for the weighing of cats and kittens,I bought it to use in my rescue work with cats and it is perfect.
4,Perfect!!,"So i bought this scale so i can weigh puppies ( i breed great danes). Its very simple and easy to use! You dont even need the intructions! It does require a 9 volt battery just fyi... So i get everything set up, turn on the scale, place the puppy on and it worked perfect.The only down side- is they have a button for pounds/KG but it doesn't tell you which one its on so you just have to know what pounds/KG looks like. Other than that...i love it!! VERY well made!"
1,Readings Inaccurate,"This scale was relatively accurate up to 13 lbs at which point it is over a pound off. I had reservations buying this initially for my baby since this scale is made in China and is so cheap. If you are buying this to breastfeed forget it, not only is it inaccurate, but it doesn't measure small changes well. Overall, I felt I wasted my money on this."
1,didn't work. inconsistent weights all the time,"I was really looking forward to this item when reading the reviews on here. Seems like most people were satisfied with this product. I am usually an easy to please person but honestly this product did not work for us. After getting weights that were a little off, we decided to just weigh a diaper, then some clothes and a diaper. The clothes + diaper weighed less than the diaper itself. It just didn't make sense. Two times that we weighed her before the doctors office naked, the scale was 3 oz less than the doctor's. The third time we did it, our scale was above the doctor's. And then a fourth time, it was quite off. And this last time, it was under but by just an ounce. It changes all the time. We returned it. Disappointed."
3,disappointing,"This bit drilled through 8"" of concrete fairly easily and quickly. After the hole was done and i inspected the bit i found that 3 of the carbide buttons were missing. This is not a cheap bit and not typical Bosch quality. I am disappointed and will probably stick to the regular carbide bits."
2,Bad warranty,Limited lifetime warranty not free. Charge for shipping on their defective product. Buyer beware.
3,"Pretty, but not as practical as I had hoped.","The cutter looks really beautiful and is well-made - the idea of having a nice necklace with a purpose is what made me put this item on my wishlist. And I finally got one for Christmas.I still like the look, but I find myself going back to my cheap cutter from Clover more and more. This one has quite small cutouts, so it is really hard to cut thicker yarns (which I love to use a lot; I am a knitter, not a quilter). Also, it just does not seem as sharp as the other one.So if you are a knitter and like thinner yarns, or you are a quilter and wish to cut thread with this pendant, it is well worth it."
3,Clever Fractured Fairy Tale,"I bought The Princess and the Pizza because the reviews recommended it for ages 4 to 8. I think t is too mature for most younger readers and would be best enjoyed by 3rd through 6th graders. As an adult, I enjoyed the story, but didn't like the ending. Also, Mary Jane is a clever writer, but I did not enjoy the illustrations of Herm Auch."
4,not yet ready,"This book was too advanced for the just-turned-3-yr-old niece who I bought it for. However, the grandmother and aunt who read it to the child were very entertained by the story and writing. In a few more months, I'm sure the child will enjoy this book, too, and then it will get 5 stars."
3,"This is not a 23"" bit","The actual measurements are 1 1/4 x 16 x 20 which is also what is printed on the label attached to the bit. The listing is wrong. Other than that great bit, we have several of them in inventory and have never had a problem with them."
5,This is the East Bay's new breed of hardcore punk.,"Breathe In's debut from Bridge Nine is a great album for hardcore. Sneering/screaming/breathless vocal with a mix of super-fast paced melodic guitar runs. The drumming is tight and the basslines have a slight evil hinge which I love. If you like Kid Dynamite, Hot Water Music, Black Flag, passionate punk rock and hardcore, get this ablum now. Plus, it's from Bridge Nine, how could you go wrong. There's definately more in store for this East Bay newcomer. Also see them live, Louie will wig out just for you."
2,Disappointed,"I really wanted to like this DVD. The sound quality is pretty crappy, granted its live, but I've heard much better live DVD's. The performance is pretty lackluster, Axl mumblefishes through the intricate lyrics and puts all the energy in screams. He does run from one side of the stage to the other and back again, and again, and again. GnR definitely seems to be on the downhill slide during this concert."
4,Great music and band performance,"This was a great buy! The music is great. The band performed great. The only dislike I have is that Axl never put on pants. I didn't like his short underwear shorts. His singing was outstanding until the last song. He started to lose his voice, but still hit the notes he needed to. You could tell it was a struggle, but he pulled out November Rain as the last song on the DVD as perfect as you could get to a studio recording. Slash was amazing all the way through! If you get this DVD, it is a must to get the second."
2,an absolute snooze,"Hey, I'll be one of many to state that "" Guns and Roses"" revitalized rock and roll. I absolutely applaud and cherish a couple of their albums; however, this DVD is boring - absolutely boring. I became more concerned with whether or not the washer was on the spin or rinse cycle.It took me several listens to get through this travesty. Seriously, this performance is that boring. I'll be so petty as to say,"" What the hell, Axyl? What were you thinking, when you and the band released this bull crap? You and those damn shorts. You were just so damn cute.""Bad asses of rock and roll? You failed here.The sound is flat. The performance is flat. I just didn't care. Maybe, just maybe, if you were all performing in some dive bar, I would have bought you a beer; then again,( I'm still being petty), I would have thought you were a wimp and had laughed at you.Save your money. "" November Rain"" is kind of good, but it ain't worth the price of admission."
3,GNR Rock the Tokyo Dome,"This is about the closest many of us will get to revisiting this era of the band. Gilby Clarke does a formidable job in deputizing for the great Izzy Stradlin and the boys blow away the lucky Japanese who witnessed this live back in 1992. Visually the video is impressive with some wicked angles and good editing. The band's performance itself is energetic and an all out, balls to the wall assault. Alas the audio element leaves a LOT to be desired. In many instances the balance is off or the volume fades unexpectantly. One would have expected this particular aspect to be stellar on the dvd but alas it merely serves to ruin the experience of some of the tunes. Still, Gunner fans who dont already own the VHS version, will enjoy themselves. Grade: B."
1,hair metal boy band,"i'm a big fan of g'n'r, but this dvd was a disappointment. it was the pinnacle of their career, and the pinnacle of axl's ego. the sound is terrible. i'm not sure if it's the fault of the video crew, the arena, or the band. it's obvious they don't care about the music at this point, and are just going through the motions. most of them spend the show running back and forth on the super gigantic stage.very disappointing look at a band that used to kick ass."
1,this is garbage!!!!!!!,"axl rose sounds like he has laryngitis, the performance is sloppy!! the guitar's sound weak. i can't believe that they released this. and the fact that they released 2 seperate dvd's for this concert is bull. if i could give it 0 stars, i would have!! save your money"
5,Guns N'Roses Use Your Illusion1-World Tour,"Not as ultimate as seing them front row in '92, but it's a great way to live get that nostolgic craving for guns (and my babe Slash)"
3,It could have been done better.,"The video is ok, the audio is not that good. If you want to crank some G N R play a cd."
1,tough to watch,"This is boring. Axyl runs around, Slash runs around, but who cares? I really like this band but..........I would rather watch a Styx concert!!! ARRGGHH."
2,Use Your Discretion 1,"WEAK. That sums up this offering. Visually its an OK show to watch. Sound quality is also just OK. Performance wise...very flat. Perhaps it was the notoriously reserved Japanese crowd that failed to draw the best out of the Gunners on this occasion. Its a shame they could not have recorded a US show where the crowds are more upbeat(or flat out insane)in many cases and may have possibly elicited more energy from the band. Whatever the case...this show,sadly,has very little edge and is in fact sloppy and boring in too many spots. Many bands have done it right...AC/DC,RUSH and STEVE VAI are examples of outstanding,tight live shows caught on DVD...this one is NOT."
1,The other reviewers are right - sound quality is terrible,I'm astounded that this DVD is still for sale. The sound quality is terrible and none of the songs ring sound as good as the youtube videos available. Highly regrett the purchase. The other reviewers had it right - the sound quality is really that bad.
5,Great Job Randy Travis,I really like Randy Travis is neat see Country Artist going the Christian way an seeing it!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Front porch music!,"You don't have to be particularly religious to enjoy this cd. Down-home comfort music just doesn't come any better. I'd start namin' off favorites, but nearly every song is a potential earworm."
1,New Creature,"If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature, old things have passed away, behold all things have become new.Theophostic counselling is divination. Never embrace lies."
1,Wolf in Sheep's Clothing,"This book leads away from the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Ed Smith loosely links Bible verses to come up with a pseudo-scriptural foundation for what is ""inner-healing,"" just another form of new age counseling. Please do research the information online before you buy this book. I recommend the article produced by Community Evangelical Free Church in Pennsylvania; search Google for ""A Biblical Evaluation of Theophostic Counseling"" I have taken the training and personally reviewed Dr. Smith's writings and his work does not line up with Scripture."
4,Complete Details of Horrendous WW11 Battle,"Many of us remaining veterans of the Second World War have an incomplete picture of what was happening in Theaters of War other than our own. In my case, I was in the ETO (France, Holland, and later Germany)during the Battle of Monte Cassino in Italy. We thought we had a tough time, but reading Matthew Parkers detailed and precise history of that important battle pointed out how little we knew of what was happening to our fellow combatants (English, French, Polish) off in another part of the conflict. I recommend that young men and women read the history in light of todays ""war."" Veterans of all wars will be moved to tears as I was after reading Parkers final chapter."
5,Best on Subject,"This is by far the finest book yet written on an under-appreciated aspect of WWII, the war in Italy; and in particular the incredible heroism of the troops that fought to cross the Rapido River and take Monte Cassino--and the equally incredible stupidity, egotism, and indifference of Gen. Mark Clark."
4,Solid entry on the bulk of the Italian campaign.,"The author writes well with a nice mix of human interest/anecdotal stories and a firm grasp on the military and political realities behind the German and Allied strategies. Probably not the ultimate book on the Italian campaign, but certainly one of the better efforts."
4,Monte Cassino's Hell,My father fought in this battle. He would always say that he could not remember or only tell me of the funny stories. After reading this book I can see why he wanted to forget it ever happened. If you are into detailed accounts of WWII battles and want to grasp what warfare was like 60 years ago you must read this book.
1,Marshall Scholarship,"steve i heard you are going to be studying in the united kingdom of great britian and northern ireland for the next two years.... something i aspire to do. If you have a moment to sit down and talk, that would be great."
1,a little something about this young paleontologist,"Stephen Louis Brusatte (b. April 24, 1984 in Ottawa, Illinois), is a young American paleontologist.He is the author of the 2002 book Stately Fossils: A Comprehensive Look at the State Fossils and Other Official Fossils. Brusatte has additionally authored several scientific papers as well as over 100 popular articles for magazines such as Fossil News, Dino Press, Dinosaur World, and Prehistoric Times. Upon completion of a B.S. in geophysical sciences at the University of Chicago in 2006, Brusatte was awarded a Marshall Scholarship to study at the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom."
4,"Nostalgic memories, just wish the transfer was better","I used to love Thundarr when I was a kid, so it's nice to be able to relive those nostalgic memories as an adult. The series holds up pretty well all things considered, though of course as an adult it now seems a tad corny.My one disappointment, and the reason I'm deducting one star, is that the transfer to digital isn't that great. Perhaps the master recordings were not in good shape but even so they could have spent a bit more time cleaning it up for digital. There are also compression artifacts -- the rectangular splotches you sometimes get for example on large dark areas of the screen.But overall if you liked this series as a kid this is a decent way to relive those memories."
5,"TOUCHING, FUNNY, SMART, TOUGH....","Quinn Dalton is a wonderful writer. These stories will make you remember why you love to read in the first place. they are all delicious though my favorite is Back On Earth, a touching and brilliant take on the life of a woman that has been raped. I know you are thinking, ""oh no, not another rape story.."" But this is not just another story. This is fresh and raw and real.I know that this is suppossed to be a review and not a sales pitch, but I really must say something to the readers out there who are ""on the line"".. BUY THIS BOOK. BUY IT RIGHT NOW."
2,A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,"THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS BOOK IS MORE FICTION THAN FACT. YES IT FOLLOWS THE ARDMS OUTLINE, BUT WITH SO FEW QUESTIONS PER SUBJECT IT PROVIDES LITTLE IN THE WAY OF PREPARING YOU FOR THE REGISTRY AND IS NOT WORTH THE EXPENSE. THE BOOK MAKES MORE OF AN EFFORT TO SELL YOU OTHER PRODUCTS RATHER THAN HELP YOU REVIEW FOR THE REGISTRY. THE CD ROM WAS USELESS, IT WENT STRAIGHT INTO TRASH."
2,Not a very helpful study guide,"This book was not worth the money or the time I spent working on it. I stopped wasting my time after the sixth chapter. Instead I studied Vascular Technology by Claudia Rumwell and that was all I needed. The questions in this book are outside the realm of what the vascular registry actually requires and I passed the test with a very good score. Also, the answers in the back of the book are mostly just references to other books, without many explanations."
3,enjoyed the sasquatch bits - hated the gratuitous violence,"I enjoy reading cryptozoology-based books and thought this one might be a good read. Bits were interesting but there was way too much gratuitous violence, absolutely loathsome characters, and not enough crypto-science. It kinda reminded me of the movie 'Roadhouse' (Patrick Swayze)....where every 10 minutes or so there HAD to be all-out kill-em and blow-em-up violence. I'm not into that kind of stuff. I finished the book but it was sad....lots of death and torture....ick."
1,is this live,"the dvd recording is no way live its straight from meteora, and i can't get the cd to play on my computer so i may never hear linkin park live until they come to my city or i break down and buy a stereo, i wanted to like this so much but i can't say i'm a happy camper right now"
1,Come on,"Linkin Park has only released 2 studio albums. Already they have a remix album and a live album. Ill say that if you do like them, then this is a good live performance. Ive seen it, its very energetic. But inevitably, this cd/dvd set is nothing more than money in the bank."
2,Again?!,"Wow, the third release by this band and all the same songs again. Some ok songs, but come on lads, it's wearing thin now. The next album... same songs again with Jay-Z. Other Linkin park fans not a little disappointed? 4 albums in 5 years and all exactly the same songs?!"
1,whats the point?,"Linkin Park has found a new way to cash in on stuff. The Its not even live- my sister saw a show on how they made it on MTV. The songs are exactly the same as the CD, and it costs 17 bucks. Even the regular CD sucks, too. Its just overdriven pop. Go listen to Rage or Zeppelin"
1,LIMP BIZKIT Suck or is this the other crap band,"linkin Park are the 2nd worst band in history only beaten by the great crap bizkit. F**k rap metal listen to hard rock grunge or punk just not this crap. Do yourselves a favour go to a store Buy NIRVANA - NEVERMIND LED ZEPPEILIN - IV AC/DC - BACK IN BLACKif you want something newer buy Foo Fighters. You will never be the same again.People say ""but you listen to old stuff"" Oh well it's not my fault this is now considered rock.And dont tell me oh ""gaykin park have sold more records than whoever!! beacuse porn star b sprears has sold more records than most bands and isn't her music just great"""
1,they are bad people,Ok. I am a big Christian and I care about the people on lincoln park. what gets me mad is all that hard work for nothing. buy something like P.O.D. or Falling Up or Piller or Disiple. but not lincoln park! please stop giving comments to them! Thanks!
5,Awesome!!!,I think it's quite obvious that some post production and editing was done to make it sound more polished(looks great but a couple scenes have the singers stop singing before the audio stops) but you know what......WHO CARES IT'S A GREAT EXPERIENCE!!!! I've seen some LP live stuff before and while it was still great it just was impossible to completely match the album. If you've seen Chester try to sing the chorus for Crawling live before he has NEVER done it as well as on this DVD and you know why?.....It was edited afterwards. I've seen 6 or 7 different performances of Crawling live and Chester is hanging on for dear life trying to stay on key. That's not to say he can't do it. About 4 or 5 of those performances were close to enough to get a thumbs up from me. So all in all this is great value for your money and any LP fan should not hesitate to pick this one up.
4,"Great DVD and CD, but ...","... there's no way this recording is free of overdubs and some major post-production. It just doesn't sound live, especially when watching the DVD. I would bet they sounded nothing like this at these shows. Also, the package says it was recorded on 2 different dates, but the guys are wearing the same clothes throughout. Perhaps they recorded the audio from 2 shows and mixed it in (along with some studio trickery) with the video from a single show? Maybe someone who actually attended these shows could comment on that. It just sounds too good and too polished to be totally live. I know it's common to overdub, etc on live albums, but this one may take that a little too far. Nonetheless, it's fun to listen to and watch. If you're a LP fan, you'll enjoy it."
5,i love linkin park!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"can u please send me as much information as you can about linkin park ""as much as u can!!!"" please please please!!!i love linkin park more then anyone can imagine i cant live if i dont hear atleast one song of theres. for christmas i wished that i'd meet them live and ill always wish for that i cant wait to be old enough to go to their concerts!!! i hope for their next tour they visit sydney in my street named fairfield. i love every single one of them and i reckon their all HOT!!!"
5,amazing amazing amazing!!!,"I'm listening to Linkin Park's first album, Live in Texas right now and I'm being blown away. The DVD is amazing and so is the Cd. Go out to the store right now and get it!"
3,Meh...,"These guys can play all their material well, but their live shows seem very very boring. Theres very little crowd interaction, their in-between song banter consists of ""thank yous"" or ""we want you all to sing this with us"". Theres no humor or attempts to get the crowd pumped up really. Also, I was a little disappointed to find out that what I thought was a riff in In The End's chorus actually turned out to be a keyboard/FX part, showing again that LP's guitarists are capable of little beyond playing 3-4 powerchords. The drums are suprisingly better than they are on the albums, but still nothing amazing. Again, the bass gets lost and sounds mute, just as it does on their albums. The real winner in LP is the vocals, Chester and Mike really show off their talents."
3,Linkin Park - Live In Texas,"Decent live album from LP. The quality wasnt all that great. But it was pretty good, and sounded good enough to listen to. I liked the DVD alot, to watch them live, it was really good quality, then video recording was. And the sound to. If you want to see the dvd, thats all its really worth, the cd itself, with the live songs are all ones youve already heard, but they sound decent. Nothing great. Check it out. No top 5....."
3,Buy this only for the dvd,"Well, the dvd is pretty cool, but the cd sucks. Not only are there not as many songs, they left off some of the good ones in my opinion. I have no idea why its not like there songs are longer than 2 and a half minutes long anyway, they could have easily fit them all on there.. but anyway.. The dvd is pretty good"
5,BRILLIANT IDEA...,"Let's leave Mr. President out of this. This cd is really cool. Linkin Park is awesome live. Take my word for it. Oh yeah, Duran Duran blows hard."
3,Almost Like A greatest Hits Album!,"I use to like this band. That was before I got into metal. I don't really listen to any rapcore anymore but LP did have some good songs. In fact, this live album has most of their best songs on it, it's just missing one or two I think. If you want to get the best of Linkin Park, then this set is for you."
3,"Okay, but the music isn't anything groundbreaking.","First off, the recording is good. It sounds like a studio album.And that's what bothers me.Nothing raw or scuzzy, like I hoped I'd hear in this live album, and on top of that, it sounds like the audience is either dead or mute. Where's the audience interaction on ""Numb"", eh?The other problem I have, I guess, is with the band itself. They sound good live, but I just don't care for it. I mean, I listened to the whole thing, and found myself gritting my teeth sometimes. Not that they were off-key or anything, but their music, especially Meteora material, seems somewhat blatantly poppy. It just feels a bit overkill to try and start a moshpit for ""A Place For My Head"", considering my mom has that song on an ""easy-listening"" iTunes playlist. Sorry, but it's my opinion, and I just find it a little too poppy to be metal. Of course, on the other side of the spectrum you got Metallica's new album, and...I'll discuss that later."
1,Tried twice...background hum in both units,"I've had a pair of ER-6i earphones for a number of years, but when the cord failed I thought I'd try the these bluetooth earphones. Checked all the reviews, which said sound quality was excellent, so I got a pair. Unfortunately, they didn't live up to the hype. The first set I got had a persist and nasty hum in the background. The hum intensity didn't change with when increasing the volume, but it was VERY apparent in soft passages. Thought these were just a bad pair, so I got a replacement set (thanks Amazon for a quick turnaround). Bad news, these had the same problem. I also picked up a new problem in that every time I put my iPod w/adapter in my pocket, I'd lose signal. I tried these with my Motorolad DROID and with the iPod adapter and same results. Looks like I'm back to the ER-6i. The cord can be a pain, but it's better than that annoying hum."
3,"Good concept, needs work..........","Having used Etymotic ER6i wired earphones for several years, I expected top quality. Unfortunately, these didn't live up to my expections. While the sound quality was quite good, and almost comparable to the 6i's, the connection, and continuous dropping of the signal made these unacceptable. About every 45 seconds or so, the connection would ""skip"" (for lack of a better word). Really got obnoxious after a few hours of it. Also, I started with my ipod 5G fully charged, and this thing drained it in under 2 hours. Also, forget the 30 feet distance, after 10 feet, the signal was lost completely. I'll stick with my wired ER6i's thank you!"
2,I want to love these...,"I want to love these headphones. They are comfortable, they sound great, they noise isolate as well as any other set I own, and no wires! Other reviews say the range isn't great, but that isn't important to me - I generally have my iPod in backpack, bag, or pocket and just don't want wires dangling around me.I was all set to give these a 5, but then I had a synchronization problem. I had my iPod in my hands, my headphones in my ears, and for whatever reason, I just couldn't hear the music - in fact, the little green light wouldn't come on on the transmitter - but the operation is just plug and play - couldn't have been a user error on my part. I sat on a plane between Portland, Oregon and Washington, D.C., cursing my headphones the whole way. Now the operation appears to be intermittent. I have no idea under what condition they will decide to work and when they won't, so I end up carrying a spare pair of earbuds with me."
3,Great idea but makes you look weird,The idea of Bluetooth headphones is great. But not at the expense of looking like robot.Joel Simkhai
5,BLUE TOOTH HANDS FREE STERO EAR BUDS FOR CELL & MUSIC,HI I'VE BOUGHT A LG VENUS 8800 CELL PHONE. NOW I'M LOOKING FOR A BLUE TOOTH THAT I CAN HEAR MUSIC THRU AND AT SAME TIME ANSWER MY CELL PHONE CALLS. THAT IS HANDS FREE AND WIRELESS. I DO NOT WANT A HEADSET. I WANT AN EAR BUD BLUE TOOTH WIRELESS HANDS FREE CAPIBALE OF DOING BOTH LISTENING TO MUSIC AND ANSWERING THE CELL.IF ANYONE HAS A CLUE WHERE I GO TO GET THIS LET ME KNOW PLEASE.THANKS AKA: DIZZZY
2,Great Sound But Poor Design and Range,"Being the third bluetooth headset I bought (and the most expensive), I had high expectations of these Ety8s.The biggest quirk is that the headphones shut off when I placed my finger near the FWD/NEXT button. Even the tech support could not understand how just getting close to the button would cause the phones to shut off, but I did not even have to press the button!In an open gym, just 12 feet from my iPod would cause the sound to drop and stutter. I got much better range (almost 50 feet!) in the same gym with my iMuffs.The ear plugs were also very uncomfortable when being inserted and did not get much better with time. I am used to the Shure E2c headphones, so in-ear is not new to me. With such a strange design (on top of it all, Etymotic needs to head back to the design board!"
3,Love no wires,"I love not having wires for my ipod. However, these bluetooth earbuds don't hold to the usual standards of quality sound that Etymotic claims.I find the sound quality, for the price, mid-range. My bose earbuds for $99.00 sound better with greater depth in bass. I don't agree that they look wierd since they are very small and fit well in the ear. It is great to garden and ride my bike without getting tangled in wires so I am keeping them but feel more work needs to be done on the performance. Dr.Horn"
3,Not quite there yet,"These sound great! (except when bluetooth fails and there's an interruption in the sound, which didn't happen that often). They do isolate you from outside sounds much more than other earbuds I've tried. They are less comfortable than regular earbuds, but that's to be expected. The transmitter draws the iPod batter down much faster (though there's still hours of life). People look at you strangely when you wear them. I was afraid that the protruding boxes would get hit and drive the earpiece into my eardrum. On the balance, not worth the money to me, but they do sound great!"
5,WOW!,"Years ago, I had the great fortune to be invited into a small critique group of unpublished romance writers in Amarillo, Texas. The ladies were passionate about their writing and it showed in their stories. Each Tuesday evening when they read, I was moved by the undefinable magic of their words and experienced the absolute awe that true talent engenders. But, one writer in particular rose above the others. Jennifer Archer captured my imagination with her novel, BODY AND SOUL. Her vivid tapestry of images set the foundation of her story and introduced me to laughter and tears. After the first few pages I was thoroughly hooked! And each successive week brought another chapter that never disappointed.Jennifer Archer delivers.BODY AND SOUL is the first novel of an incredibly talented writer, and I'm sure you'll be as delighted as I was."
3,overpriced.,I don't think this product does much. I felt like this toner is almost like water. That's probably why it doesn't cause irritation?
3,Very general,"This book's title is a little misleading. It should be called ""what is a music producer?"".It was just a general overview of the job. It's fine for what it is.You will not learn anything about the art of music production here."
4,Average,Everything must be done with passion. Which art does not include passion? What can be greater than producing something that makes us have feelings? Music production is an art and it's going to be that way as long as people still enjoy making it so knowing how it is produced can provide useful help for further teaching or a career into this field. This is an amazing book with lots of interesting information all related to music production so if you have a passion and that passion is music buy this book and you won't be sorry!
3,Great Unit With One Flaw,"This Boombox, contrary to what other reviews will tell you, has a great Sound. It has 4 EQ Presets: Rock, Pop, Jazz, Classic, and of course the default, Flat; plus bass boost. It has no distortion at top volume. The CD playback does NOT have a common issue of a noisy, hissy motor as some have previously stated. It is flawless mechanically, and has a superb AM/FM Receiver capable to tuning in even the weakest FM / AM Stations. However, one buys this boombox for one reason: MP3 Ability. And that's the rub.Burn 140 tracks, the player will recognize 89. Put that CD in your computer and it will say 140 tracks. There seems to be a rather common software glitch in the MP3 Codec installed on this unit that has random troubles with MP3s. I've tried ripping at various formats, different media, etc. Nothing seems to end the issue. RCA has a little more work to do in Quality Control. Over all I'm happy with the purchase..."
3,not the ultimate boombox,"If only it had a counter display and a cue-FF function, it would be the ultimate boombox."
2,No better than a clock radio,"The things I noticed right away when I turned the unit on:- Sound quality is very poor due to the small speakers. There is no basses at all, the x-bass button makes almost no difference.- Radio reception is weak. This boombox could catch only 1 or 2 stations with lots of interference, when a simple clock radio I had played all the stations clearly. Pulling the antenna out actually made the reception worse.- The CD rotation mechanism is too noisy. When the CD spins the top plastic pad which keeps the CD in place makes hissing noise. Very noticable at low and medium playback volume.These few draw backs make the use of the unit quite unpleasant both as a radio and as a CD player."
2,Disappointed,"I bought two of these... While the RCA RCD159 is inexpensive and compact, it lacked a feature that drove me crazy. The problem is that when you put a CD in, then press the play button, you have to wait until it reads all the tracks(sometimes 15 seconds for me). After that it displays the number of tracks. Then you must press play a second time to get it to start playing!!!After a few months the player would start showing ERR on the display when I inserted CD's that previously played fine. My other player plays them fine...So could be something with the CD read window/adjustment....The radio is poor quality in the sense that it only picks up a few of the local fm stations(they drown out the rest)... Whereas my truck radio picks them all up(able to separate them better).Threw the RCA out. My wife still has hers(at work) ...and says it is OK for the price..."
4,I love mine too!,"I have had it for over two years, and I use it nearly every day. I'm sorry for the folks that miss the headphone jack, but having audio-in instead means I can play my mp3 player through it. That's how I use it much of the time. It plays audio CD's great, and I use the radio too. I do find I need to record flat-directory 80-file mp3 CD's tuned to its idiosyncrasies, but the media is cheap.I agree I'd like to purchase a few more features if they were available a la carte, but for my money this is the best device."
1,No Headphone Jack,This boombox SUCKS!!! This deserves negative 10 stars!What kind of music equipment does not offer headphone usage?AND the picture above is wrong. The picture above clearly has a headphone symbol above a hole. It's wrong. It actuality it says Audio In. I am returning this piece of $@&% immediately.
5,"BUY Unspeak: How Words Become Weapons, How Weapons Become a Message, and...",How spinmeisters bamboozle the public with words. This comprehensive analysis gives you the lowdown on those clever word twisters who twist the truth into lies and lies into the truth as they see it.
2,Study of journalistic fantasy,"""Unspeak"" might have made an interesting article for a magazine, but the material the author has gathered here doesn't warrant a book. It embeds the journalistic fantasy that seems to plague so many modern ink-stained wretches: the fantasy that, since objectivity cannot ever be accomplished, subjectivity is just fine thank you very much, and that anyone's subjective stance is therefore as objective as anyone else's. [Incidentally, this is part of the reason for the awful modern 'news' practice of having journalists interviewing each other.]The book is really an embittered rant against (mostly) modern public political discourse. The author's particlar political prejudices shine brightly, and badly distract from the central theme of exploring political speech.Minor errors (such as seeming to completely misunderstand the very old term ""natural sciences"") further disrupt the flow.The book this one attempted to be still needs to be written."
2,Not a lot of Great White footage,"I was looking for DVDs on the Great White Shark and I was intrigued by this offering. Most of the video,(80%) is taken up with people talking about sharks instead of showing sharks. I'm disapointed and wouldn't recommend this video."
5,Exactly as Pictured,This item was delivered super fast and it came just as shown via the picture. Love it.
5,Very Nice Sushi Set,I purchased this sushi set to give as a gift. The set was very nice and the recipient loved it. It arrived quickly and in good condition.
5,Great Series of DVDs,"My son loves this series. When Shark Week was no longer OnDemand on our TV, I had to search out the DVDs so that he could see even more shark action. It has become more than a show. We ""play"" Shark Week with the couch being the boat and we've got decoys and lifeboats, etc. Loads of fun."
5,Will the real JAWS please swim up!!,"These videos are very good for the person that doesn't understand the ocean.These videos can help people understand that shark bites are very rare,but they do happen.I do think it says you should respect sharks no matter their size,from small to extra large.You don't see sharks growing legs and walking on land, just likewe live on land they live in the water and are faster swimmers than us.So don't go swimming where you think sharks could be, just remember thisthey have found sharks in 3 feet of water.I rate these DVD's a 5 of 5 stars!!"
5,DOES AIR JAWS WEAR AIR JORDANS?,"He doesn't need to but he can jump as high as his airness! A fantastic collection of SHARK WEEK programs from the last 20 years, this will excite and captivate any shark enthusiast or expert.The 14 episodes cover a diverse spectrum of shark lore, from identification,distribution and preservation to shark attack survivors and ancient sharks including the awesome Megalodon.Fans of the Great White are in for a treat as the shark is featured prominantly in several outstanding episodes.The package design is first class with a holographic cover and great graphics making for an essential purchase.On a final note,the interview with the young russian woman who survived an attack while her boyfriend did not, is one of the most affecting moments this series has produced."
4,Repetitive but worth it for Mundus,"Like other reviewers, I'll say that this collection is repetitive, and it reinforces stereotypes by focusing too much on attacks and great whites. The selection could have reflected more on diversity of species and the importance of sharks in the ocean food chain.There are, however, some spectacular episodes. My favorites are the two Air Jaws episodes and the profile of Frank Mundus, famous shark hunter. His story and personality shine; this one episode alone is worth the price of the collection. It makes a good companion to the book In The Slick of the Cricket. I haven't yet read his biography Monster Man, which unfortunately is currently out of print and priced out of my range."
5,shark week worth the money,"for twenty something bucks, this is a really good deal. there are four discs containing hours upon hours of shark info. some of the info can get a little redundant at times, but that's understandable because of the nature of the cds. all in all, for the hours of shows that are on the discs, shark week is a really good deal, and kept me entertained. if you're fascinated by sharks, buy this set of discs. i haven't swam in the ocean since. seriously!"
5,One of the best comedians ever,"Steve Martin's TV stuff back in the 70s and into the 80s - classics of television. A true Wild and Crazy Guy. Just thinking about his material gives me ""Happy Feet."" Steve, you are so bleeping funny!"
1,Don't bother.,"Very disappointing, just some mild 'G' rated stuff. Nothing edgy, comedy for your parents. Stick to the great SNL stuff."
5,Funny stuff!,"I like all of Steve Martin's material, and especially this collection of his best. Several of his all-time favorites are included. The delivery was fast."
2,disappointed,"Steve Martin is one of my all time favorites so I was eager to view this. Well,,,they certainly didn't pick the good stuff for this one."
4,Funny and fun,"Timeless (for the most part) and hilarious... we are having a terrific time going down memory lane and laughing our heads off at the antics of Steve Martin, some of which I have seen before and some that I missed. It's great sharing this with my kids as well,"
4,Industrial Ambient,"It pulses, greates, occasionally wails into the night air ... this is as much a collection of sounds as it is ""music"" per se, but it's an effective and enjoyable soundscape if you ask me. Reminds me of the work of Raymond Scott, and of sound effects records. Was it important or influential? Well, I think it's probably accurate to think that acknowledged fan Brian Eno had this rattling in his head when he and Robert Fripp laid down ""No Pussyfooting""."
2,Lacks convincing center,"2 1/2Sure there's enough for ambient enthusiasts/historians to get excited about, but by the time the third and longest track is over, innovative synthetic soundscapes of alien grandeur have already turned cliche."
1,defective cd,"this was the 2nd time i ordered this cd. the first time, the cd was damaged because of defective packaging.. the 2nd time the cd was defective & played garbled music & sounded terrible. i am playing this cd on a mcintosh mcd-205, so it is not the fault of the player. i repeated the same results on a ms-300 & a mvp-861. i was apparently 10 days too late in returning the cd because i wanted to be sure it was defective. i will never order another cd or dvd from amazon. please print the review this time! thank you- a very disappointed customer!"
5,Decades of George Jones,"I've always been a George Jones fan, and have a couple of his albums. I wanted to get a ""best of"" type album that includes all his big hits in one place. I am very pleased with this collection, and also enjoyed reading the interview with George and some of the history of the songs in the CD insert.The album is broken down into one decade on each of the three CDs - the 60s, 70s and 80s. Although some of his hits have been left off the collection, it would be impossible to include all of them. The man is a legend in country music, and has been churning out the hits for forty years! I'm glad they didn't put any of his duets with Tammy Wynette in the collection - they deserve their own album. Each and every one of George's hits show his honesty, his partying nature, and some of his heartbreak and regrets. Very few other singers in any genre can match the emotion that George puts in his songs.If you're looking for one great collection of his hits, this is the one!"
2,Not all tracks are original,A fairly good set but on this type of collection the original recordings are what you expect. I couldn't find anywhere in the product description that some of the tracks were new versions or which ones.
5,George is 100%,"I've followed George Jones for years, and this is THE BEST of George. If you listen you can hear his voice mature into George Jones today. Not to say all the years of George aren't just as good."
4,Great Album,"Party of Helicopters are an amazing band. I'm not a big emo fan, but i still really enjoy their music. It's driven by powerful guitar riffs and very melodic vocals. I strongly urge anyone to buy this cd and it is pretty inexpensive so there is really no reason to not buy it. Keep a look out for these guys because they tour frequently, and they are working on a new album so keep an eye out for that release."
3,Whoever produced this needs to be punished,"This is one of those incredibly frustrating albums: the songs and the band are great but the production is absolutely diabolical. Thin muddy, weak sounding rubbish that makes it really difficult to listen to. I'm no snob when it comes to this sort of thing but I honestly thought the first song was a joke it was so bad. To make things worse a few songs (clearly recorded at different times) are better produced and give a glimpse of what could have been. For similar crimes against music try Shudder To Think's 'Ten Spot'. Great album, destroyed by producer. I really want to like this more than I do."
1,Unreliable Fujitsu Drivers - No TWAIN drivers - Awful,"I have owned this unreliable piece of equipment for 2+ years and made the mistake of recommending it to friends after I got it, not smart on my part.It is inexcusable of Fujitsu to not provide industry standard TWAIN drivers. This should have been my first clue. The supplied Fujitsu driver is quite unreliable and has been the source of much frustration. Do a google search and you will find legions of users with mysterious OS and driver/scanner problems after installing this product. One of my friends who bought this scanner for his law office on my earlier recommendation has had similar on again, off again problems too.I am not challenging the good experiences other reviewers here have had. Just do your homework, look on the web and Fujitsu driver problems will standout as a reoccurring theme. Get a scanner with TWAIN drivers and save yourself future hassles."
2,lots of space,The bag over all has been great. I have had it for five months and the only problem that I have had is that the shoulder strap is coming loose from the bag. I would recommend this bag as an overnight bag for baby stuff rather than an everyday diaper bag.
4,Another winner by Tanenbaum,"This is the second Tanenbaum novel I've read in recent months and is definitely another winner in my book. I love a good legal thriller and this has all the req. elements: good plot, well developed characters and it all wraps up neatly at the end.I will definitely be back for more."
1,Which ones are Michael Gruber's-?,If someone can tell me which of his books were actually written by Michael Gruber I'll be happy to buy them!
1,"I would give it zero stars... but Amazon doesn't allow that.,","I read tripe before. I've read some of the worst published drivel you can offer for a literary Razzie, but this is not only scraping the bottom of the barrell, it's actually lower than the spongiform that grows on the bottom of said barrell. How does this guy have a book deal? This was my first and surely last Tanenbaum book I read. Amazing that such a hack with a Germanic surname of ""Christmas tree"" and a keyboard can produce such a joyless novel. Tis the season to throw this book in the trash."
4,Good book,"I am familiar with commercial metal framing and drywall. I know nothing about residential metal framing. This book helped answer alot of questions I had. I still have not framed a house in metal but if and when I do, I know this book will have made alot of the techniques and materials easier for me to understand and work with."
4,"A woman goes in search of the Holy Grail, finds love","Kira Ellison takes a vacation looking for the Holy Grail as a diversion. Along the way she meets someone who sparks her imagination that the grail might actually exist, taking Kira to Southern Italy near the ruins of Pompeii. Kira finds herself battling against her attraction to the head of the excavation, working against time and nature to unearth the legendary artifact.Dominic Fioretti is the dark Italian padrone, a man fighting to uncover the identity of his father's murderer hidden among the group of archeologists working in his excavation. When Kira arrives at the site, Dominic struggles against his emotions, trying to understand the prophecy his father passed on to him about who would uncover the lost grail.I couldn't put it down and the information packed into this story makes for a very satisfying read."
2,More Recycled Garbage,"Another book that recycles the information found in the THOUSANDS of other similar books about the SAME topic.This guy throws a bunch of ""TO DO"" things at you, like MAKE TIME TO MEDITATE, MAKE TIME TO EXCERCISE, BREATHE DEEP, DON'T BINGE EAT.Heck if I could FInd the time to Meditate, and find the time to hit the Health Club after my 2 hour commute home each night, I wouldn't have the stress to begin with.Once again I heard about the Flight or Fight response...it's getting kinda old now,..how many books are gonna carry that snippet of information.It was an absolute waste of more than 10 bucks which caused me even more stress.You can get the same info for free at Helpguide.Org,..but hey,....wadda I Know."
3,Good advice but reads like an infomercial,"I really wanted to like this book more. The suggestions are helpful but it just seemed highly ""recycled"" as another reviewer mentioned. It reads less like a book and more like a motivational speaker giving a 30 minute speech over the course of a day-long seminar (which is surprising for such a short book). I did get some use out of this book, but it was more painstaking than necessary I think."
5,Fantastic...a must-read!,"I absolutely enjoyed reading this book. It would have really been useful to me years ago while at the height of my management career. The book contains excellent information that can be used not only in the workplace, but also in everyday life. I especially enjoyed Bob's writing style...definitely kept my interest. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to have a better and less stressful lifestyle. Congratulations to Bob Losyk on a fantastic job!"
2,where are the worksheets?,"I love the ""complete"" series which is what prompted me to make this purchase. I got the book today and it is nothing like the rest of the series....there are vast areas in this book that have no worksheets or activities to help the child ""own"" the material. It is basically a textbook...It might be a fine history book but I think including it in the ""complete"" series is misleading to loyal users of the series. I wanted more fun activities for each unit and was expecting at least one consummable worksheet for section and am sad at how few are actually included."
5,history IS interesting,"This is a fun book and easy to read with nice activities too. Altho' it's a childrens' book and I'm nearly 50, I enjoyed reading it and find it historically correct."
2,I wouldn't buy it again,"my son retains no information from this book. Yet if we just pull out a history book that we have laying around the house he remembers everything. I simply don't get that. So for us it is not that great. Yet, I can see how some children would benefit from this a good deal. Each topic is in a few pages and then some type of activity is given at the end. So for a review, refresher it is alright for children. Some of the information I did NOT find to be correct but I understand political correctness means more to people now a day than truth."
4,"Colorful, great activities, perfect-sized lessons","We're liking this so far for 3rd grade homeschool. The pages are all full-color, which is engaging for the child. The narratives are interesting - it doesn't read like a textbook. There is an interesting activity (map, graph, recipe, etc.) to reinforce each lesson. I found my son looking/reading ahead just for fun!"
5,good product at a good price,this is a hard to find designer fragrance that is a good product at a very good price
4,RANGE BUSTERS DOUBLE FEATURE!,"TRAIL OF THE SILVER SPURS is a pretty good B-Western involving some ghost town doings and an on-going gun fight between baddies George Chesebro and I. Stanford Jolley. The boys save the day (and the town) of course. Varying print quality seems to change from reel to reel.I liked Tonto Basin Outlaws better as the boys are after horse rustlers back on Crash Corrigan's old home town turf. Here we find that as a kid Crash belonged to a secret club and was once known as Chipmunk Corrigan. His giving of the club's high-sign is a hoot! Tris Coffin plays his childhood pal who is really the top bad-guy behind everything. Ed Cobb is also on hand as a henchman. The print quality is better than ... SILVER SPURS making this one really enjoyable. So saddle up and ride with Crash, Dusty and Alibi, I'm glad I did!"
5,"Wonderful for tactical, self-defense, or recreational purposes!","In our fair state, we can't carry knives, except in marine areas (huh??). When kayaking, snorkeling, and diving, it's handy to have (it also pisses off the liberals when they jeer at me from shore, that makes me happy), and for camping. It can also serve in the field (some Army guys carry this, even though it's not authorized equipment). It's tough, durable, and can survive salt water environments. That's all I need to know!Oh, and can it actually perform it's ""PRIMARY"" function, that all combat and tactical knives are SUPPOSED to do? Yes, I would imagine so."
3,Good value but lacks in a couple respects...,I bought this knife because I saw how well it stood up on knifetests.com. But that is a destruction test. And then for around 30 dollars what can you expect? Not giving it 4 or 5 stars because it does not come sharp enough out of the box. Nothing like most Cold Steel knives. Nothing like a Ka-bar BK 9. Fails the copy paper slice test consistently. I tried putting a good edge on it with a waterstone and as that really did not do anything with a sharpening kit. Result: Minimal improvement. 3 1/2 stars would be about right.
4,High quality knife.,I received the knife and was impressed with the quality of the workmanship. It appears durable and of higher quality than those discounted at Big 5 stores...
3,weak edge,"I was excited about this product. I received it quickly which was great. After opening it I was instantly impressed with the grip, balance, and sheath. However, the knife itself was dull, very dull. I've never received any knife be it pocket, camping or tactical with such poor finish. But I sharpened it. However there is no sharpening the point of the knife which is rounded off. I imagine this knife was better a few years back because today its dull and has no point on it. It'll go in my camping bag but if it comes out it will be because I cant find or dont have anything else on hand."
5,Very nice knife,i bought this knife for a christmas gift for my son's girlfriend. (She requested it). She loves it! It was just the right size and has a very good blade.
3,It's okay...,"I have not noticed a difference in hair growth, but I like the conditioner and the scent. I'll keep using it."
4,Good conditioners for the price,"I have tried this conditioner for about a month and I thought it was not bad for the price... I love the smell it does not seem like something that horses have thee hair washed out with , but I was impressed.... The conditioner made my hair soft, but the only complaint I have is that it made my hair feel like like a straw. I thought it was more of a conditioner to use when you want your hair to gain strength. Not bad just not something I would want to use everyday...."
4,Want Thicker Hair?,I'm trying to grow my hair out for my wedding. i can't tell if it's getting longer but after two days of using this shampoo my hair has gotten a lot thicker and easier to manage.
3,Nice change from ordinary shampoo,"Might be a great conditioner, but I need a good trim/cut because my hair isn't healthy & I this did not make the detangling process any easier. My body leave in did a better job. It's not life-changing, but it is a nice change from ordinary shampoo. Try this shampoo & condition - you won't be disappointed!"
1,Seriously disappointed.,"**NOTICE: THIS REVIEW IS ABOUT THE PACKAGING, NOT THE PRODUCT ITSELF!!!**I was excited about trying this product because I heard many great things about it! In fact, I got it in the mail today (along with the shampoo) and I was eager to try it out ASAP. However, I was severely disappointed with the condition that it arrived in. In fact, if I could post a picture here, regarding the condition that it arrived in, I'm sure you guys won't be pleased with it, either! As soon as I return it, I will just be marching up to one of the local drugstores here and buying it in person, in order to save myself from further disappointment.That being said, I still am eager to try out the product."
5,Very enjoyable!,"I picked these up for my 8yr old son to read and he zipped right through them. He really enjoyed the series and asked for the other ones as well.When one would arrive, he would read through it immediately. I would highly recommend these books."
5,Daughter LOVED this set,My daughter loved these books. She didn't stop until she read the whole set before Dec. 27 (she got them for Christmas).
5,Loved by boys too,"My son loves the Magic Tree House series and Caption Underpants series---and now this one too. I especially like that these books star a girl, yet appeal to boys. In terms of reading level, this series is easier and less ""serious"" then the Magic Tree House series---it's closer to Caption Underpants (lots of scribbles and drawings, goofy antics, and not too much text on each page)."
4,Franny K Steins Crate of Danger,"My four year old son loves all the Franny books! Franny shows kids that it is okay to be different, that science can be lots of fun and that most ""scary"" things really aren't. My only complaint is that my son is constantly doing mad scientist experiments. We have test tubes filled with interesting items all over the house, just waiting to see what happens. Not high literature, but a lot of fun."
4,Should have been a double CD,"The Registrators came to America at the tail end of the mid-nineties garage punk rush. Personally, I got to tour with them through the Mid-west and WEst coast and I ca honestly say that their live shows are imcredible. Thier ability to take pop-music and put it through some warped new wave/garage noise-blender make them on original sounding band. It is not fair to compare them to their Japanese contemporaries Teengenerate. Their styles aren't relaly that similar. This collection should have been a double CD, I believe their is a Japanese veriosn that is. This colleciton of 15 songs is missing some of the best singles they released. Though most of the songs missing are still available on vinyl still. This is much more noisy and garage then thier more recent releases including the more pop-laden recent Rip Off release. If you missed the boat on their early singles and enjoy thier first LP ""Terminal Boredom"" then this collection is for you."
4,just takes practice,"I've been looking for a tent like this to house our outdoor toilet and this looks perfect. It also seems sturdy enough to hold a camp shower. The top zips closed but it doesn't have a fly so I might buy a small tarp just in case we have a downpour.I've read a lot of people had trouble folding it back up so I practiced at home. The directions are right on the bag and once I figured it out it only takes a few seconds. Pay attention to how it's coiled up when you first take it out. If you have trouble folding it up, there are videos online that go through the process step by step - another reason to try it at home first!"
4,The shelter is very servicable,This sheltor is really great!It is so amazingly fast to set up. You do need to use the tent stakes to hold it in place. I do have trouble rolling it up to put it in its carry tote. We actually folded it into thirds this last time and laid it flat to take it home.
4,Save yourself aggravation,"The Porta-Privy is wonderful for convenience while camping, however there are two disadvantages. The first is that the top is not rain-proof, so just be aware. That is a minor issue. The biggest problem is that it is nearly impossible to fold up if you follow the instructions that come with it. It's not as if you can improvise because if you do you could ruin the entire unit. After countless attempts and many, many frustrating experiences I finally found a You-Tube video done by another frustrated camper who figured it out and was kind enough to share his knowledge. If you don't view the video, don't take the Porta-Privy with you on your camping trip or you'll regret it! Check out Trekker Fold A Privy on You-Tube and you will be able to enjoy this product."
1,Low quality,I had to return this product because the coating used on the inside had separated from the frame and began to flake all over. The flakes blocked the interior light and began to burn when they landed on the bulb. Poor quality control.
1,Light stopped working,"The mirror is great and sturdy. However, I accidentally bumped the mirror (not hard) and the light stopped working. I replaced the bulb and it still doesn't work. I've owned it for less than a week!"
2,Too much magnification.,"The mirrior was of good quality, but the magnification was too high and the image seemed distorted. I had to return it and purchased a different one."
4,THE LIGHTER SIDE OF PALEONTOLOGY,".......and by ""lighter"" I don't necessarily mean funny, although the book made me smile at times. It's refreshing to find a non-children's book on fossil hunting that is well written and entertaining in an easy going way.FIELD ADVENTURES IN PALEONTOLOGY is a quick and enjoyable read. It chronicles Lynne Clos's fossil hunting trips in an-easy-to-read yet informative style that makes you feel as if you went along. If you want to read about the human side of paleontology written in a diary style and format...this is one book that won't disappoint. It won't help you identify that strange fossil that you found but it will enable you to pass a pleasant evening."
5,A great gift for yourself or loved one.,"What a great book! A wealth of trivia, some of it well known, some not so. But all totally fascinating. We just kept turning the pages to find more & more interesting people & facts. Great also to see it covering more than just the States. The 60s were a world wide event & Chris has captured icons from across the globe."
4,my viewpoint,"I found this an excellent presentation, for me it was spoilt because there was no access to any written notes.Very difficult to absorb everything during the presentation.!!"
4,Awesome,"If alive and live at the lighthouse didn't exist this would be my favorite grant green album the mix isn't as goog as the other live albums because the 24 track master tapes were missing and this was taken from a mono recording but the guitar is still funky and overall an interesting selection of songs. This is a beautiful album that anybody who has listened to live at the lighthouse , or Alive! will surely appreciate."
5,Love these fiery little guys!,"Gotta love the role these fiery little guys play in heaving snow off our cement. A magneto rotates on the engine flywheel inside our two little snow blowers. Every time that magneto passes the ignition coil, high voltage transmits to these spark plugs. The plugs emit a timely spark inside a small cylinder bored in the engine. That tiny spark triggers an explosion inside the cylinder. Here's where it gets really good... The explosion pushes a piston down, which rotates the engine's crankshaft. That spinning crankshaft rotates an auger with rubber paddles. Those spinning rubber paddles scrape the sidewalk---hurling snow up, through a chute, and off to the side. Why? Because these plugs sparked the whole darn process.Would I recommend these spark plugs? I most certainly would---if your engine specs call for RCJ8Y plugs. ;)"
5,Charles-Review,It is a Great CD about train songs and I have it for my own music library and this ine is for a friend in Minnesota and his name is Mark Sova.
5,Must have!,"If you like rock music you must have this. Great job catching a great concert on film. For VHS, it's pretty good.This was filmed at the peak of GnR, so it doesn't get any better then this.Make sure to also buy part 1 for the whole concert."
3,Well.....,"When i was young i loved Gnr as mad that was the only band beside metallica i respected. i bought both dvd's and i must say honestly that i was not very impressed specially when i saw Axl Rose Jogging around The Stage loosing its breath every time you listened to a song, its not what i remembered of Gnr when i saw it live at the ritz that was a hell of a show, Appetite for destruction and use your Illusion seem to me of two different bands a heavy one for the first and a sissy one the second, sorry still a heavy metal fan."
4,quite rocked but never the same,"This wasa cool film, but still i miss izzy and steven, the drum solos to long, but its still cool to se guns, i dont think the crowd was loud enought, still the musics quite good, and the intro to knocking on heavens door rocks..."
4,Great performance!!,"I just picked up ""Guns N Roses: Live in Tokyo I"" and I must say it is a very good capture of the group's performance from their 1992 World Tour in support of the two ""Illusions"" albums.Filmed in February, 1992 at the Tokyo Dome, that venue provides a fine backdrop for one of the best metal acts of the late 1980s and early 1990's.The video quality is great, although I wonder why they interrupted the show to insert a minute or so of behind-the-scenes footage. It disrupted the overall experience (though only slightly), and I feel it should have been inserted at the end. The spotlights that are shone on individual members as they run around on the huge stage provide a nice touch.Highlights include ""Welcome To The Jungle,"" Paul McCartney's ""Live And Let Die,"" and of course, the sweeping epic, ""November Rain.""I highly recomend this one to fans of G 'N R, but also to any fans of hard rock who also appreciate great concert videos!"
5,Finally GNR DVD,"For us Axl's fans, Universal Music finally remembered who makes (and unmakes) the music stars, after waiting for 15 years, we have something new to play on."
2,Ritz in NY 1988 is the only thing worth having,"why why WHY dont they release something from the 80's? totally bogus. I turned this thing off 1/3 thru it, Axl running all over the place in his little shorts, talking /shouting the words like Mick Jagger in concert, lame. is the last 2/3's worth it? like is said in here, I dont know, sold it the day after I watched it. how can it be? how can the show get better with Axl running all over in those shorts? no way."
2,Video/Sound quality is subpar,"The video and sound quality is subpar. Axl Rose's voice was so coarse and can be hardly heard but Slash's guitar was awesome, esp. in the Godfather's track, Sweet Child O' Mine, and Knocking on Heaven's Door."
2,Class-less Guns N Roses,"When i say that GNR i my favourite band, i certainly don't mean what you see in these DVD's. These showcase the band at its worst, already near the brink of completely disbanding. The raw energy and passion that made them unwilling superstars in the late 80's was long gone by the time of these shows, along with two of the original 5 members. Without Steve Adler on drums, the music loses its energy drastically, with a new guy instead of Izzy Stradlin' on rhythm guitar, Slash has to hold back, and the camaraderie of the band is visibly forced. The Ritz show in New York from february 1988 is an infinitely better performance by the ORIGINAL GNR lineup, it can be had for free off of Emule or other P2P sites. These videos, meanwhile, will make a real Guns N Roses fan sigh with disappointment."
1,Could I see a band please...........,"and not a circus act. How long can you stretch out a drum solo?? I went to the bathroom to throw up, and when I came back it still wasnt over. How depressing to see such a talented band fall into the ""Bloated Elvis Syndrom"". Spoiled to the point of overindulgence and it shows. The stage is so big, that you rarely see the whole band all at one time or in one spot, or for that matter anywhere near each other. They dont even seems like a band anymore, but 5 seperate pieces floating around in nothingness. What happened to the raw attitude they used to have. My grandmother would enjoy this, but if your a die hard GNR fan, and you want to see them play as a band, and not a circus act than go find a copy of ""Guns N Roses Live at the Ritz 1988"". If your really a glutton for punishment Ill gladly sell you mine."
1,"What happened to ""Get in the ring!""","Can somebody explain why in the world they didn't include the incredible ""Get in the ring""???"
5,the definitive gn'r video,"this is the album you gotta have at home. and this is the dvd you gotta have at home. nothing more. axl rose, slash and izzy stradlin on their best form of ever. so don't forget to buy this."
5,i dont know,"i want yhe video ""makin of estranged"" how i do for get it and the video guns n roses from concert in rio brazil thank you"
3,"well,quality sucked,axle's voice sucked,band sounded good","now if you are a GnR fan you will like this vidio. The music is great but axle sounded a little if.But the best part to me was the solo of just duff,matt,and slash's talking guitar.This vidio wwas well worth buying and I give it 3 starts because of the quality. It could've been better.If you have seen a van halen vidio from hartford,conn...you would know why i have it a 3"
2,comprehensive but poor drawings,"This book covers a lot of territory, but a lot of the drawings are poorly reproduced, blurry even, and might not be suitable for disassembly/reassembly."
3,Better than the others,"This book was panned by another reader, but compared to ""The Gun Digest Book of Exploded Long Gun Drawings"", this one is much better. Several of the Gun Digest book drawings are so poor as to be useless, a function of the quality of the original more than reproduction. For readers interested in an book with a lot of older firearms drawings, get a ""Gun Parts Corp."" catalog."
4,Great puzzle,"My daughter loves this puzzle! I would say if your kid is smart, he or she will be able to piece it together without help before they are 2 1/2 yrs old. I love it because it occupies her for about 15 minutes while I make dinner or do something else. The box has a diagram of the the train, so the kid can look at it to figure out what comes next. No matter how smart your kid is though, the puzzle is not pee-proof. I have to buy another one since the ""accident"". Highly recommended for puzzle-loving kids."
3,Out of date,"Too much of the book is dedicated to showing assembly language shaders. The examples are built with the DirectX SDK and framework that was available when it was written, and won't compile with the later SDKs (I have June 2005). Other than that, it is a good reference to supplement the difficult to read SDK documentation."
2,Read DirectX9 SDK documents first.,"I suggest to read DirectX9 SDK document fist that comes with DirectX9 SDK. Think about this book later. This book ends explanation as stream of comments of the simple sample shaders that come with SDK. I'd say this book is ""out of focus"". There are bunch of important things that should be explained - are not in this book. Such explanations are in SDK document.However, if you want to be away from computer and learn about shaders in relaxed in your bed or at a cafe, or if you are an naturalist who do not want to waste printer inks and papers to print out SDK document, in terms of such points, this book may worth to you."
3,No Microsoft .NET,"My book has ""Microsoft .NET"" on the cover, down left corner. It's the reason I bought the book. It has NOTHING to do with .NET. I don't understand why Microsoft puts it there? It's like BMW putting ""V8"" on the back of their 4-cylinder 300-series just because they have V8:s."
3,Good but not great,"I had a few skipping problems with this dvd but they seem to have gone away. It is very good but it just isnt great. There is plenty of other way better bluegrass dvd's avalible out there. And before you buy this one i would get some other bluegrass dvd like ""High Lonesome"" All Star Bluegrass Celebration, or The Three Pickers.Mike in Virginia"
1,"3 DVDs from 2 different stores had serious defects, be wary!","We could not get this DVD to play correctly with three different copies on two different machines. Copy 1 did not play at all.Copy 2 and 3 only worked if you fast forwarded through the beginnings of each song in the concert set. This is a big headache and disappointment as well.If buying this ""Soldier of the Cross"" album I would recommend buying from a source that will allow you to return a defective DVD for your money back if all their copies had the same manufacturing defect in them. It seems there is at least one bad ""lot batch"" out there of this product at this time. It is unfortunate as the album would probably be great if you can get it to play well enough to watch and enjoy.Enuff said."
4,Good Enough for the price!,"I ordered these as a lot of 6, as just what they say they are, Breeding Cages! I hope to start breeding parakeets and finches for sale at a nearby bird farm, I have a written contract that they will pay per bird, based on markings and tameness. I will hand tame the birds. I know that hand tamed birds will go to better owners! These are not a $100 parrot cage, if that is what you want, then buy a $100 parrot cage. I ordered two orders of these and they sell very well with a pair of finches!"
1,Amazon.com LLC is a rip off!,I received ONE cage and when I followed the instructions to recived the missing 5 cages I was given a lable to send the ONE cage back AFTER I asked for the 5 missing cages to be sent to me. I'm disgusted in the fact I now have 5 birds ready to lay eggs without cages and Amazon DOESN'T provide a way to simpy contact them. I'm hoping to get my OTHER 5 cages and not have to deal with taking apart the one cage I have already set up. Several other breeders warned me not to order from here but NO I did NOT listen!
5,24-piece puzzle in a funny storage box,"I bought this puzzle for my 3-year old son. 24 pieces is the right difficulty level for him. Puzzle is very durable and nicely made. I am not a fan of floor puzzles, so I was looking for a puzzle with medium-size pieces. I think that this one has perfect size.The picture is also convenient: it is easy for 3-year old to figure out the parts of the picture on individual pieces. There are a lot of separate objects: chickens, house, fence, clouds, cabbages... It is fun to find the right place and to discuss the picture after the puzzle is completed.The box is very cute. I would expect that is falls if placed vertically, but it is not. Me, personally, I prefer rectangular boxes for easy storage, but I like this one."
5,Clarity,The simple yet profound beauty conveyed in both the words and art work in this book are a gift to behold. I am grateful to have found it and am thrilled that I have it to enjoy again and again.
5,"""Clarity"" -- a book that speaks to the heart","From the first lines in the preface about the beauty of life itself to the last metaphor about how we, like a coconut, carry within us all we need to thrive, ""Clarity"" takes us on a journey inward to our heart and soul. Prem Rawat, using vivid anecdotes and heartfelt poetics, talks about our feelings and needs, and about how important it is for us to find fulfillment in our life. Reading just one line from this book can make all the difference in a person's life, and even one taste, just one moment of understanding his message, can bring true joy to the heart. It certainly did to mine."
5,Refreshing perspective,"This is a book that brings a refreshing perspective to my life and my innate thirst to be fulfilled. It may not speak to my intellect, but if when I read it I am silent enough, it touches my heart and awakens me to the possibility of feeling peace within myself.Prem Rawat, in a quite unique style, pushes you gently and encourages you to discover that indeed, it is possible to feel freedom and joy and not to compromise your own understanding about your need to feel that way every day of your life."
5,essential feelings,"i love the simplicity hereas a poet i aspire to communicate essential feelings in the simplest way possibleand prem rawat is a master of thati'm reminded of the original and organic power of words and images when i read this book'Our life,our understanding,our want,and our thirstare all simple.We are simple.When we are in that real place, there is joy.'right on !!"
5,More than words,"I find that Clarity conveys a beautiful feeling of something very dear and familiar yet long lost, like coming home again. Graphically fun and interesting, the content touches the core of what it means to be human, to be alive. Yet it goes beyond the words on the pages, and invites you to continue discovering."
4,Received as a gift,"A friend gave me this book as a gift. It's visually lovely and it is surely written from the author's heart. He talks about stuff I already know, but forget. It's really simple, so if you want a complex discussion of ""Life"", you won't find it here. Some really nice reminders though. Very pretty graphics."
5,The Gift of CLARITY,Not only has Prem Rawat's lovely book been a source of pleasure and inspiration for me - but I found myself giving it to so many people last year that I had to order it in bulk! It's the perfect gift.
5,A breath of Fresh Air,I am always interested in finding books that I can flip through to inspire me - Clarity is one such book. It's simply and yet the more I re-read it the more good stuff I find in it. A great book to have next to you on your desk.CG from Ausse.
4,A wonderful opportunity,This is a simple glimpse into the world that is Prem Rawat. He has a magical way of inspiring the truth that is already inside us. This is not something new - it is familiar to the heart. I am glad to see this opportunity presented here in this beautifully written book.
5,AWESOME!!!!,Prem Rawat makes a lot of sense. I found this publication to be extremely inspiring. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for inner peace and contentment
2,This toy is too fast,"This toy is bad. It's too fast. We've been trying but it only has one speed but it says it has three. If this is only a little bit slower, I would be able to do it.From two girls that are 5 and 7"
3,not pleased with false details,"i purchased the jump dancer,for my (5)year old granddaughter.i was really hoping the reviews, i had read before hand,was not all true.i gave it the benefit of doubt.but itis not as the box desribes.it says it has 3speeds,not true.it only has 1 speed and that is very fast.i returned it,and explained to my granddaughter that it did't work as it should."
1,not fun as an indoor toy,"We recieved this toy for Christmas and my 6 year old daughter couldn't wait to try it. We have used it indoors on a concrete floor so far.The regular jump rope mode didn't work very well for us indoors. The rope would just not stay attached to the door. That mode was not fun as it had to be constantly adjusted.The horizontal mode with the ball on the end of the rope went better for us. The slowest speed still seemed pretty fast. I think if it were on carpet or grass it might be better. We are going to try that before giving up on the toy. Getting hit with the ball did hurt.At this point, I feel this toy is just not fun enough to justify the cost."
5,I really like it,"I like the way it looks; it's sturdy without being overly heavy like the manhassets (which I also like and have used for years); it's stable and fairly portable. Highly recommended. The adjustment clamps and couplings are plastic, but should not be a problem unless you plan to overtighten them to the breaking point."
1,garbage,"this unit has nice picture on 1050 i mode ,but using hdmi connector degrades coax digital output to stereo.forget about dolby or dts on your receiver.this was confirmed by philipstech support as design flow.i think it is rather subject for recall and i am degrading this player to garbage status."
1,7 Months Later and its Toast...,"Although it produces a nice picture on my 37"" LCD it broke after only 7 months of use. I bought it refurbished from overstick and it now plays for about 15 mins and then just turns off. Actually, it doesn't turn off completely. The disc continues to spin but the the main display turns off and and the signal to the tv goes dead. The only display light left on is the blue HDMI light. All my other dvd players have worked for many years, which I thought this one would do as well, but the Philips just crapped out all of a sudden. I'm now quite skeptical of Philips. Buyer beware."
4,Nice design and does the job.,"We have got this player about a year ago. It still works fine.Its only weakness is that it is a very slow thinking device, for example, turning on and off takes quite a long time. Other than that, no complains."
5,RIVERGIRL,"THIS IS ONE OF MY BEST MUSIC DVD'S,LIVE IN DUBLIN MAY BE A LITTLE MORE ROCKIN'LOVED IT!IT WOULD BE A MUST HAVE"
1,"Horrible, and not remotely natural","I've never seen a bath and body company lie so much about natural ingredients. Brown Sugar fragrance oil is ""naturally occuring""? Hah. Plus, the products are substandard. I won't buy from them ever again."
1,PIA,"after three people going through every RCA code in the booklet, and all the way to put the code in, it still didnst work, i ended up going to best buy, and it didnt even let me return it, dont get the remote, and i thinking i wouldnt even get anything from the company,"
2,Save yourself the frustration and buy something of more quality,"I was excited when I purchased this item. And, I got it on sale! Well, ""you get what you pay for"", I guess. First, the original package was missing one of the side panels (a thumbs down). The company was quick to replace the part with no hassle (a thumbs up for them). But, the replacement part did not fit properly (another thumbs down). The groove for the back panel was too thin to accept the panel and, also, the holes to connect the base were mis-aligned. Boooooo! Then, to top it all off . . . the draw sits very awkwardly in the tower (another big thumbs down). Save yourself the frustration of feeling that you ""cheaped out"" on this and invest in something you'll be happy to see in your house, even if it costs a little more."
3,"Good, but not great","Great design and look, but the some of the parts doesn't fit. Good thing its near the back so you can barely see the gap. This item could be taller. Nice wood and very functional."
2,Bert and Fritz together at last!,"This is a relatively straightforward propaganda melodrama, with nothingparticularly compelling to recommend it, but for one notable exception.Bertold Brecht's villains and miscreants are all so full of gusto. They share kinship with the ones in Threepenny Opera and Mahagonny after all. It seems Brecht could not create a scoundrel he couldn't admire on a certain, mischievous level. The ones in this film are no exception, and lift it out of the ""ordinary"" into the realm of the ""oddity""."
4,"There is a place in my heart for Troy, NY","Before Richard Selzer I didn't think much of Troy. Selzer's descriptions of his Dad's practice, the story tellers at the corner pub, and the action along the river are not glamorous but they are rich and warm. He taught me how to make the best French coffee and dazzled my mind with exotic words. Now I beg my husband to make detours through Troy. He thought I was nuts until he read the book, and now he's hooked too. I have read nearly all of Selzer's books and this is my favorite."
3,HELLO?,My daughter recenty discovered Lionel's music and was blown away by his smooth meaningful songs. Lionel is not just for your mother's generation only!
1,CD Return,"I ordered this CD twice this year. Unfortunately I was unable to play it, the devices that I have (5) that I use would not allow it. Make sure to play it as soon as received to make sure it's OK. The first one I purchased was for someone else and they never told me there was a problem and it was to late to return (30 days). Also ordered from another company with the same results. Conclusion, don't order this CD."
4,Very handy,"Very complete Do it Yourself book. Detailed in trobleshooting issues. Not so good do that it is written for 3 different models, therefore, pictures included which become so important to you, usually are not included for your specific car leting you to guess about the appearance and location of a particular car part.Still, it is a very good book."
5,Accuracy Above Dogma,This book is a scholarly investigation into the trial and execution of Jesus Christ.It is very well written and researched. It moves beyond the dogma and rhetoric of modern day Chirstianity and sheds ling on the realpolitics and dynamics of 1st Century Jerusalem.You conclusions will be much more clear and concise after reading this book and your understanding of the times that led to the Crucifixion will be enlightened. I strongly recommend this book.
5,Cannot tell you..,"...if this skillet can whip you up a teeny tiny delicious meal or if it looks nice as a spoon rest. I use it as an ashtray on my mom's patio. She loves it because she can empty the butts by picking up the handle, thus keeping her as distant from my grody cigarettes as she needs to be. I love it because it is heavyweight, not easily breakable, and cigarettes rest nicely on it's grooved edges. Smoking is a bad idea. This skillet's dual purpose is not."
3,"Folks, it's an ash tray.","I think Lodge is trying to get one over on us by calling this a spoon rest. My parents had these when I was a kid, and no one ever called it anything but an ash tray. For the purpose I wanted it, which is to burn incense cones safely, it works just fine."
2,Very Small.,"While I bought this as a spoon rest I was under the impression it was a cooking spoon holder. Its about the size of an aluminum can bottom. You can rest two small spoons on it, nothing more."
3,Boycott Syndicated Versions,"As long as we keep buying these syndicated box sets, nothing will change. Public, let's take a stand. As much as I like Alf, and many other TV shows, I will NOT BUY THEM until I get the full version.I give three stars because Alf is a great show, but I do not own this set."
2,I Love Alf But EDITED VERSIONS???,"I Love The Show Alf Is Awesome But With Alot Of Tv Shows Going To DVD They Are Being Chopped,Cut I HAve The Alf Tapes From When It Was On Tv And They Are Unedited I Bought This Cause I Wanted Them On DVD But I Know The New Golden Girls season 3,4,5 Etc Better Stay Like Season 1 & 2 UNCUT!"
4,Everything great but no subtitles.,"The time it took to arrive home was great. The package was in great conditions and everything was fine, but I'm not 100% english speaker and sometimes I have trouble to understand idioms at the series. I can get the main topic of the chapter though and I'm taking this as a challenge to improve my english."
4,The best season of Alf,"Although it is a close call between which season of ALF is best since they were all very funny, I like season 2 the best because this was the season that the character really becomes developed. Whereas season 1 established Alf as an alien from Malmac, season 2 seems to develop Alf's personality and character. Among my favorite season two episodes are ""Can I get a Witness?"", where ALF is unfairly accused of throwing a football through the neighbors' window and the family has a mock trial, ""Some Enchanted Evening"" where Alf goes turns Willie's party into a costume party and goes as himself, and ""Hail to the Chief"", where Kate dreams of running for President against ALF. Overall, another hilarious season which fully develops ALF by the end of the season."
3,ALF Season 2 on DVD,"Yesterday in the mail I received my ALF Season 2 DVD, and I was disappointed. First epsiode I watched was ""Night Train"", and the scene with ALF and Willie singing ""City of New Orleans"" was deleted. Then I watched ""Oh, Pretty Woman"" and a very funny ALF impersonation of Dianna Ross singing ""Stop, In the Name of Love"" was gone. If you havn't found a pattern here, Lions Gate was too cheap to pay song rights. You would not honestly release a movie with parts missing, TV should be given the same consideration. NBC, Paul Fusco, or someone should have complete episodes, they should sell those and not these chopped up sindications. Lions Gate, be honest!!!"
1,Disrespect!!,"This season will contain the cut versions so once again we will be missing 3-7 minutes of eatch episode.Not releasing the original 24-25 minutes episodes Lionsgate are showing disrespect for ALF, american culture and last but not least: Their customers!Only a Lionsgate-employée or a person who has never seen the original versions would even consider to give this garbage more than 2 stars.Giving it 5 stars must be some kind of a joke! Why would anyone in their right mind give this message to Lionsgate: ""We are satisfied with cut episodes - don't mind us, just carry on making cheap releases and make a lot of money""Wait for the UK-release and don't let yourself be fooled by people with hidden motives or no quality-sense!"
2,BEWARE: Syndicated Episodes Here,"Just as with Season 1, these are syndicated episodes, that are nice and chopped up. Pathetic. Truly pathetic. What more can I say?"
4,great price,"i got this for my sister as a present when amazon had tv dvds on sale. she loves Alf, it was one of her favorite shows and i know she likes that i got this for her."
3,a computer fan from toronto,"I bought a lexmark p3150 a couple of weeks ago but I returned that.It was really slow. more than 3 minutes to print a 4X6 photo in standars mode and around 12 minutes in hi quality mode.the quality of printed colors was also far from reality.it is just good enough to have color prints, and not photos."
2,"You get what you pay for, I guess.","I got this printer for $98 from Wal-mart. It is extremely slow, even when printing regular documents (even slower than my 3-year-old base model Lexmark Z12!!) The photo quality isn't very good either. I should have spent the money and bought a better printer."
1,Prin Trio Photo Printer,"This is quite possibly the worst printer I have ever owned!!! The Cannon I had was awesome and then I made the mistake of buying ""refilled ink"" as I am sure a lot of people have done and totally botched their printers like I did! This Lexmark printer is not worth $25.00 much less the $95.00 my husband paid for it at WalMart! It is lame and these people are right in saying it is slow and doesn't print photo's well at all even with the photo cartridge! Cartridges are very expensive as well--black more than $28.00 and color more than $35.00! Hope you find this helpful! By the way--notice it's not on the market anymore."
1,Rotten Thermometer,Only used it twice and it will not even go up to 250 degrees with the oil smoking! What a piece of junk.
3,Not as advertised.,"I thought I was getting the uncensored version of the album, but when it got here it was the censored version. That would be fine except it bleeps out the words instead of just cutting them out of the song, which is pretty obnoxious. This only applies to one song, the rest of the album is great, but it's my favorite song from the album so it's really frustrating."
2,Crap,"The author is all over the place with this book and is extremely obsessed with sex as every chapter seems peppered with junk about models being coerced. Not to minimize the accounts, but the book is filled with a bunch of stories of 'never were's' who never made it to the status of Carolyn Murphy or Cindy Crawford whining about how they were taken advantage of and didn't go anywhere with their careers. Ian seems like a pervert in many respects and if he is going 'undercover' to parties where models are being exploited, then he is part of the problem and not the solution. This book is even more slimy than Michael Gross' book. Ian also seems to believe he was a 'model' himself, and looking at his one picture in the book compared to other online pictures of him, it is no wonder he never got anywhere. Piece of crap, glad I didn't pay much for it. Don't waste your time or money."
5,A little poke in the ribs,"Halperin's undercover tale has comic charm, dramatic tension and psychological intensity of a best seller. An intense, well written and researched book for young and old alike."
5,Excellent Book on Models,"I read this book last weekend...couldn't put it down. I've been in the fashion business for years. This book really hit home. If you like fashion, models or are interested in pop culture, this book is a must. Especially if you want to get involved in this industry, you must read this book. A real eye opener. I just wish there would have been another couple of hundred pages. Excellent read....more, more, more."
1,STOP! a waste of time and money,"The only reason this gets 1 star is you can't give 0.It is poorly written, poorly executed and does not even make sense. It is obviously written by someone who has little if any experience writing anything much less a book. It has to be self published; there is NO publisher out there that would print this mish mash garble. The positive reviews are very suspect at best. If you read them they all have the same writing style, written by the same person?SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!"
2,"good material, poorly presented","I think this guy has like 100 different copies of what is essentially the same book issued under different titles on Amazon and in bookstores. Maybe hoping for double and triple sales from stupid people? I have what I believe is another copy of the same book called ""Shut Up and Smile."" Much of the material is rehashed from old newspaper reports, other people's books, etc. Some stories on sad lives of lesser-known models is interesting and not something we've read before. The passage on Halperin trying to be an undercover model is a joke. He's not a great writer and the material isn't as shocking as Halperin thinks it is. But some of it is worth reading."
1,waste of time and money,"Before reading this book I did not know that writing this bad ever got published. Janice Dickinson has a better writing style (or editor) than this ""author"". How anyone can give this book a higher than one-star rating is a mystery to me. Unforgivably bad."
4,Great old-fashioned storytelling,"This Hammer Studios film is one of their lesser known but better films.A remake of a 1940's era film ""The Man in Half-Moon Street"", this one hasa more sensationalized approach and benefits from the presence of AntonDiffring in the title role. Christopher Lee is the ""good"" guy but thisgreat actor's aloofness may have you rooting for the title characterinstead (no offense Chris; we're just used to seeing you in villianousroles). Beautiful sets, gorgeous color, great actors including the late,great Hazel Court and a breezy short running time make this a winner allthe way."
3,WORTH WATCHING,THIS MOVIE DOES NOT HAVE THE GREATEST SPECIAL EFFECTS BUT IT HAS A GREAT STORY PLOT AND WILL NOT BORE YOU. I THINK IT'S WORTH WATCHING.
2,Not that good,"This book contains some standard topics treated on an elementary way. Unfortunatelly mathemathical formalism is almost left out.The approach to the subject is pretty popular.I think one is going to invest her/his own time in a better way by working first on V.I.Arnold's ""Classical Mechanics"" (symplectic formalism) then going on with E. Ott's ""Chaos"" (one of the best on the subject, but Lichtenberg-Liebermann is also a good one, in my opinion) and, finally, taking a look into some parts of Arnold's ""Geometrical methods of ODE"". More stuff is available on the Web (arxiv.org --> recent abstracts and new approaches on dynamical systems in Physics). This is a good way to gain a technical basis instead of a popular one."
1,Shameful - Too many major errors - Best to avoid,"This book is by no means meant to be a primary text. It clearly states it is a review textbook to help prepare you for tests. This it does decently except that there are many simple mistakes that detract from its usefullness.By no means am I a Mathematics expert, but this book has too many glaring errors. See Chapter 4 in particular, they even answer some of their own test questions wrong. For example problem #23 or pages 71-72, the graph is totally wrong I can tell with out using a calculator.How dare someone release such a poorly checked text."
1,Where is The Fly?,I purchased this product to share a childhood favorite (The Fly) with my grandchildren. It was billed as a double feature containing The Fly and Return of the Fly check out the movie cover). Imagine my surprise when the first movie was not on the dvd. Only the Return was there.NOT HAPPY!!!!!!!!!
2,The Fly is good but the sequel is a stinker.,"The first Fly movie (1958)works because of the good direction and editing.It also has some innovative moments,such as the ""multi eye"" view of the character's wife and the shock ""help me""ending in the spiders web.The director of the first film is sensible enough to either show a very close shot of the fly head or a quick long shot.The director of the second fly movie makes the mistake of not having these quick shots and the result is some awful and unintentionally funny scenes of a man with a big plastic fly head walking around.It is simply a case of the director not thinking and learning from the first film and the Fly 2 travels into b-grade Ed Wood territory.A truly awful sequel with overlong shots of the fly throughout.A thought from a fan:why not just release the first film on it's own and spare fans the terrible second film?"
2,Beware!! still photo/ad art galleries can be problematic.,"I've encountered an exasperating technical problem on the Fly Collection bonus materials disc: Viewers are instructed to use the right skip/left skip remote buttons to move forward or backward through the still photo/ad art galleries, but whenever I did so a red slashed O flashed on screen, indicating that I'd requested an impossible function. ( I had the same difficulty with Fox's Horror Classics (Lodger/Hangover Square/Undying Monster). I e-mailed Fox - twice - about the problem; no reply.) This is a large disappointment, particularly in view of the fact that Fox's DVD packaging bears no disclaimer suggesting that any of the bonus material might be inaccessible to certain DVD players."
4,Good Old Horror,"Brings back good memories. This is a classic monster movie as it doesn't show all the graphic gore, but is actually scarier because your mind must work by filling in the blanks."
5,The Fly Collection,I received the product in a timely manner. I will be ordering frm them in the near future.
5,Excellent album !,"Very good idea to have these two DVD's, the first and the second parts of this classic sciencefiction films. I watched it on TV when I was a child and I still remember some scenes that astonished me. Now, I watch the DVD's once and once again and I enjoy it so much."
5,Excellent Bargain Fantastic Extras!,"Fantastic to see beautiful remastered prints of all three Fly films in one box set. Great to see David Hedison and Brett Halsey in the Disc Of Horrors extras.The documentary on Vincent Price from 1997 is also exceptional. Narrated by Richard Kiley, it is a fascinating look at Vincent's life and career. Buy it now you will not be disappointed."
2,Linear,"I love giving Live P.A. a chance and some acts that I have heard are amazing. This CD by Hesohi, on the other hand, is just plain boring. I have listened to it three times now, in an attempt to give it a fair chance but it just does nothing but inspire me to put in another CD. I find the distinction between songs is minimal. It is more like one long track with very few variations or changes. Hesohi creates very few breaks or build-ups, the sort of thing that can truly bring a dynamic feel to the music, and this is truly one of his downfalls. If he does release another CD I will give it a chance. This one, though, is just plain uninspiring and non-interesting."
5,Tremendo libro para el musico cristiano,Como musico cristiano siempre busque mi roll de ser musico para Dios. Este libro respondio a muchos de los problemas que confrontamos los musicos como el porque hay musicos que le sirven a Dios a medias y otros con toda pasion. Marcos Witt muestra las diferentes clases de musicos asi como las responsabilidades como salmistas que tiene los musicos delante de Dios. Este libro lo recomiendo para todo musico que esta sirviendo o desea sirvir a Dios con su talento musical.
4,contents review,"The book is a compilation of one page articles written by the listed individuals, there is no collaborative content in it. It is good, especially the lesson pages, there are some pages that are philosophical and somewhat esoteric, but overall the content is good. It would be nice to have a CD of the music and tablature, and there is no option to get one."
3,Concepts are fuzzy,"I started to use this book from chapter 1-4 and I already dislike it. For instance the nomenclatature section does not explain what is the IUPAC naming for compounds pertaining functional groups well enough. The spectroscopy part, is too basic, it does not present a in-depth view of how important functional groups absorb the IR spectra. Finally, the answer that appear at the back of the book are to few, out of about 40 problems only the solution for 10 of them appear. This makes it difficult if a student wants to check an answer and does not have the solutions manual. If this book continues to be like that, I think that I might study from another book, a Professor recommended me Seyhan Ege."
3,Call me crazy...,"But I don't like the scoopers with the fancy slidy thing that this one has. I have one, as well as several other ice cream scoops without - and this is my least favorite to use. The slider makes the scoop much messier and harder to clean, and it really doesn't work that good. The handle on this scoop is ok, but other scoops are much better designed and comfortable to hold on to. Overall, it isn't a bad scoop - it still scoops ice cream.. but there are much better choices out there. I recommend the KitchenAid ice cream scoop!"
1,Packaging has changed and pieces are not cut well,"One of the nice features of Infantino puzzles used to be the packaging, but they've switched from the nice lidded tub shown in this picture b/c our puzzle came in a cardboard box. It's sturdy but the lid is not easily opened or closed even for an adult (mostly b/c of the sample puzzle piece attached to the rope handle and the slit it's supposed to go through being undersized. So basically the packaging is now a throwaway item which is a mistake for a puzzle. Also, the number shape pieces are cut too tightly. We can barely get the pieces together. My almost-2-yr-old can definitely not do it. Maybe they will ""loosen up"" the more we play with it, but I can't see us playing with this very often. We have other Infantino puzzles that we really like, purchased 2 years ago. The changes from then to now are very disappointing."
5,Good Educational Toy,This is a great puzzle for helping kids learn their shapes and numbers. Matching games are an excellent way for kids to have fun and learn at the same time. The pieces all come in a bucket for easy storage and for taking it on play dates.
3,Its ok but only good for one time use.,My Son is 2 yrs old. I brought this for him . However he fixes this puzzle in 5 mins. He enjoyed it first time and later got bored. I would say it is good only for one time use .
3,A nice puzzle,"My 3 yr old daughter is into puzzles so I decided to buy this one thinking she would like it as well as learn her shapes and numbers. I figured it was also be good for my 4 yr old son too. But they didn't hae the patience to figure out where everything went. I think this may be good for 5 and up, once they start to learn numbers and the order they go in."
1,piece of ...,"Stagey performances , poor sound, repeating songs, every wretched excess in the ""music video"" style with jerky camera cuts, sexy babes for no reason, Not what I expect from Neil.I've been a fan since '66 and this video is very disappointing , especially if you have seen ""Rust.."" and ""Year of the Horse"""
3,Not Neil's Best Effort...,"This is an fairly entertaining set of Neil videos from the album, kind of done in the same manner as his film ""Human Highway"" (slightly irritating)...The album itself is much stronger than the video...Leave the television off and crank up the stereo!"
1,Nano users-beware,"If I could give this 0 stars I would! The IPOD Nano adapter plate didn't allow the Nano to align with the docking station, therefore it was useless for my Daughter's IPOD Nano."
4,"Great LITTLE system, but distorts at higher volume.","We have used these speakers now for several months as a secondary system in our master bedroom. The sound quality is good as long as you want to listen at low to medium volumes. The sub woofer makes for full sound for such a small system. As with any inexpensive, small speaker system, there is distortion at higher volumes. The remote is IR, so you must have line of sight for it to work well, and it doesn't control menus on the iPod, just track skipping, volume, power. Overall a very positive experience."
3,Same as Peregrine 1800,"This is an older version of the Redtail 1800. It's a copy of the Kelty Peregrine 1800 with different color schemes, possibly lower quality nylon as the Peregrine is all 500D kodra. The reason the other reviewer received a black pack is probably because this version of the Redtail 1800 has been discontinued, is out of stock, and they are sending out black Kelty Peregrine 1800s instead."
2,too small sizes,"when i saw these for the first time online, i thought ""sweet deal!"" and i purchased it and when it was delivered, i was so disappointed. the whole thing is about the size of my hand. not going to buy this again and i don't recommend it at all :("
5,HOTTTTTTTTTTT,"I'm a huge hot sauce fan, hard to find anything hot enough for me. I just love this stuff put it on and in all I can all the time."
2,Meh...,"This stuff is hot, but it tastes strange to me. This is a great sauce for someone who wants something hot enough that they can't taste the food, but if you want to make your food taste better, this isn't the stuff to get. If you want to show off how manly you are by eating hot things that other people can't eat, this will do that for you, but for someone looking for the best hot sauce to enhance their meal, you need to look elsewhere."
5,UNREAL,"As someone who buys Tabasco every week, I thought I could handel everything. This stuff is REALLY HOT. I didn't even dare to open the hottest one... Think twice before you buy cause most people I know wouldn't handel 1/2 a drop of it. It tastes great. Recommended!"
4,Dave's Hot Sauce,I bought this item as a gift. It was something I thought would be different than the usual gift basket. I really liked it and so did the person I bought it for.
5,Spicy and flavorful,This is a great product. It comes in a nice selection with all levels of extreme heat represented. My hubby likes to get others to try it who think they can handle it. Others always comment the it is hot but it also has great flavor. We like things hot but they also need to taste good!! This variety pack does not disappoint.
2,Never got it,"I tried contacting the company about never receiving the set, but they just responded ""The USPS tracking says that the package was delivered."" What a help they were. I did receive a one bottle package later in the week of Daves Special Edition Insanity Sauce, although I haven't tried it yet... I was more excited about the variety in flavor rather than the ""hottest-sauce-ever-made."""
3,Hot Sauces,"The sauces are smaller than you may expect, so be aware of this.They are very hard to get out of the bottles.The Ghost Pepper Sauce READ AND ADHERE TO THE LABELthis is an EXTREMELY hot sauce and can be used in industrialcleaning purposes."
2,Ouch,"This stuff burned my mouth for about an hour, literally singing my lips. I drank approx. 15 cups of water through the ordeal. I didn't know that you're not supposed to 'spread' this on the bun of a sandwich. I knew it was hot, I didnt use much, but I did not know ghost pepper was known for being the hottest pepper. After settling down, I only discovered a few hours later that the fun was not over, as I felt a similar burning joy on the other end of my body (read: my anus). I can't say I recommend this sauce, unless you plan on throwing it in the eyes of your biggest enemy (in which case it would be really effective). Could've spent the money on another lap dance.. 2 stars for really being spicy though.."
4,Was a gift,I assume the Hot Sauces were fine. They were a gift and I haven't heard any negative opinions
5,Required Reading for DJ's,"This handbook leads you step by etep into the world of pro DJ's. Follow every word and you can't miss making your business into the power leader in your area. I worked the pages and now I have quit my job and do this fulltime very successfully. Thanks a billion, Stacey!"
2,too general,The book was way too general and really didn't offer any advice on the specifics of being a mobile dj. The book's font was quite big. I read it all in 2 hours.The beginning of the book unfortunately was just general knowledge and fillers.I was expecting an insiders view on the mobile dj business.
3,Fast but dated,"The book has some great general information, however it is very dated and does not apply very well to the digital age that we are now in."
2,It's ok but a bit fragile,Firstly this set arrived with the small lid broken. Amazon of course sent a replacement set but then the large lid was broken on that one. I now have my full set however it feels kind of thin and fragile. It's an ok buy but when the time comes to replace them I'll be looking for something a bit more durable.
2,Red color is a dingy grey/red,"I ordered this for my wife to go with some other red cookware she owns. The set arrived intact, although oddly packaged, a small box inside a much too large outer box with inadequate bubble pillows (packing material) just thrown in. The outer box was pretty beaten up, with the tape split on two sides.Although the dishes appear to be quite sturdy, we are planning to donate them to a charity. The color is a dingy grey red, not at all as pictured on Amazon. The low price lured me in, I should have known better. As the saying goes, when something looks too good to be true, it usually is."
2,This Set Needs To Be Packaged Better!,"As the previous reviewers stated, Amazon has a problem shipping this set so that it arrives intact! The Corningware box does not protect the set well enough for shipment with the insufficient Amazon packing. My first shipment arrived in pieces. Replacement set also arrived broken! Amazon wouldn't or couldn't send me what I needed to make a complete set. Returned order. So, I am now searching for a set in the Orlando area."
2,"Too heavy, lids don't fit",The first shipment arrived with pieces broken. The lids do not fit. They are much too heavy.
2,Clearly These Should Be Packaged Differently To Ship,"It was quite disappointing to receive the items broken. Looking at the way this package was shipped, clearly the packaging would NOT protect this item from damage. This method of packaging breakables should clearly be changed. Especially since, my order was not the only one to arrive broken. Disappointing! The crumbs looked like the bowls could have been nice."
3,They need to rethink the packaging,"Love the product, love the color, love the flexible utility. But they really need to rethink the packaging on these. I ordered my first set, excitedly opened them and both lids were broken. Amazon couldn't replace as they were completely out of stock and told me they could refund only. Then they magically came into stock one day (with only one of the item) and I optimistically ordered again. Excitedly opened the box when it arrived and this time only one was broken. Maybe the third time would be the charm, but I'm counting my blessings and holding here."
5,Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church,Excellent! It's an abridged version of the full version of the Catechism of the Catholic Church.
3,Good Compendium to the Vatican II religion,"This provides a good, briefy survey of the Vatican II religion's basic beliefs. I found it interesting that Ratzinger doesn't believe heaven is a place, but is a mode or state of being. Not sure where he got that from (Jesus is there in His physical body, and He went to prepare a...PLACE for us). However, this didn't surprise me as Ratzinger likewise denies the physicality of the resurrection so it does comport with his denial that heaven is a place. Of course, none of this has anything to do with Catholic theology."

5,Excellent Value!,"Boots were perfect and an excellent value, especially with the Amazon discount and free shipping. thinking of buying another pair!"
1,Amazon against overseas GIs?,"I just ordered these boots from another source. I hope and expect to love them. My beef is with Amazon. I am a long-time Amazon customer for books and music, and tried to order these, but they refused to ship them to a US Postal address on Guam, USA. They will not, apparently, ship apparel including boots to APO / FPO addresses, either. Decent boots are NOT unexportable technology. This idiot policy is a slap in the face to those of us who serve our country."
1,Not worth it.,I have worn the boots on two days and have two blisters from the white pads that are on the inside by the heel of the foot. E-mailed company three days ago and have not heard from them. Not worth the money in my opinion.
3,Composite Toe,"These boots are very comfortable, however the composite toe on the right boot, when squatting or bending over, would dig into the top of my big toe. They were so comfortable otherwise, that I ordered another pair, except I went with the waterproof ones instead of the composite toe."
2,Not the Same Product,"I have a pair of these boots, two to be exact. I ordered the same product number as off the old boots. But when the new ones arrived they were not the same. My old boots had a protective plastic barrier on the back of the heel of the boot that traveled up past the ankle. The new boots stitching was very sloppy and not in line at all. Stuffing was hanging out around stitching near the zipper on both boots. Same product number but not the same craftsmanship I expected. Because ""Made in China"" was stamped all over everything makes me think that Converse or Amazon has played a very bad joke on me. The older boots lasted 4-5 years and that was using them in the Middle East going over some very hard terrain. I anticipate these boots falling apart a lot sooner than the previous pairs. Only time will tell."
5,WORN IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN,THIS IS MY FORTH PAIR OF CONVERSE WORK BOOTS. I HAVE WORN THESE BOOTS IN THE IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN DESERT. I HAVE BEEN IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD FOR FOUR YEARS. THESE BOOTS HAVE GREAT ANKLE SUPPORT FOR WALKING ON THE ROCKS HERE. THEY ARE EASY TO TAKE ON AND OFF WITH THE SIDE ZIPPER. THEY ARE EASY TO TAKE OFF WHEN GOING THROUGH AIRPORT SECURITY.
4,Awesomely Comfortable,I bought these shoes because I heard a lot of the GI's were wearing them. They are extremely comfortable and break in easily and quickly. The only draw back is they are made in China (just like everything these days). If they had been US made I would have rated them a 5 star item.
4,Great work boot. Security friendly,This is the second pair of these I have purchased. My work enviorment requires entering via a metal detector and also having EH rated safety shoes. These are perfect for work and long days on hard surfaces. No break-in period. Just step in and go. I could not give them five stars only because they come from China. I wish they were made here. I would pay extra just to have them made in the USA
2,"The first, but the weakest","If you're interested in the history of the Ukulele,this is a record containing some songs created by its father, the Madeira Island's four-chord instrument, braguinha. Unfornately, the recording is bad, some groups are bad choosen and the global sounding is weak. It's a pitty."
3,The Platinum God,"Nothing fancy here. If you like old Alice Cooper, buy it.If your teatering, don't spend the money."
5,Great Bio,"This book is a must for anyone who wants to discover how great St. Dominic really is. This book goes beyond the popular surface stories about the saint. History reveals the truth about this great saint -- a truth more impressive than the few miraculous stories that are usually told. You've had the milk, now here's the meat! A surprisingly good read."
1,STRIKE OUT,"Heavy item-130 lb's and NO packing in carton. Two very badly damaged, on 3rd try still damaged, sides dented,leg broken causing safe to wobel, two corners dented in, but exterior skin not perced so it is still fire proof. Out of sheer frustration I will keep this damaged one but should get a partial refund. On third try it is evident all will be damaged because of NO protective pading inside of carton. VERY BAD EXPERIENCE."
4,Keeps Interest Longer Than Most Toys,"Keep in mind most reviews are written shortly after receiving the product. However this kept the interest of my 7-yo for a good year which is impressive. However, once the track is built, after about the 50th time around the track, it is a rather boring. Most of the fun is building the track and there is only a limited number of tracks you can build. If you have a kid that like to build things, they'll love it. But it is only good for a short amount of play time once in a while but it is one of those toys that will get taken out once in a while over and over again. The steel balls can get scattered under furniture though if you are not careful to supervise as sometimes the ball falls off. The motor seems a bit unreliable after a while but overall a good toy."
1,not what I expected (in a bad way...),"The product I received is not the product pictured above, although it has the same name. There is no ""glow in the dark"" aspect of the toy I received -- the box (and product) looks very different from what is pictured here. The box for the item I received was in poor shape even thought the outside Amazon box was pristine (i.e., the box left the warehouse in this damaged condition and should never have been sent). I am debating whether I should even give this to my son for his birthday later this week, or if I'd be better off buying something that looked new. At least the toy will be easy to open when/if the time comes, as it is only held (barely) closed by one piece of scotch tape."
4,DRG at it again,"Kudos to DRG for releasing another obscure or long unavailable cast album! But in their usual fashion, the liner notes are insufficient (see another review above). And worst of all, in usual DRG fashion, the track listings are incorrect (as they are in Amazon's listing above; there is no Bonus Track). The case and booklet list 13 tracks, when in fact there are 14. The 14th track is actually the ""Jupiter Forbid"" portion of the finale that is shown included in track 13. Careless of DRG, and disrespectful of their (admittedly, limited) audience. Let's hope for an ""Encores"" production and recording, but until now, this is a very enjoyable recording of a typical 60's off-Broadway offering."
4,"Very useful, but use with care","This is the easiest to use and probably most comprehensive book of human measurement, in my opinion. The data provided in this book is of extreme value to anybody designing anything that physically interacts with human bodies. This is the only complete source of anthropometric data, that I know of, for children of virtually every age range.However, some of the extrapolated data in the book is impractical for real use. For example, children's furniture dimensions recommended by this book are generally too small as they appear to be based upon exact proportions of adult recommendations. This is inappropriate because children's bodies and minds are not exact scale models of adult bodies.Overall, though, I still recommend this book highly, but also recommend very careful use of it."
2,Dog's Rule,"Bought Jack and Jill by Daniel Kirk and loved it. After reading numerous reviews on Dog's Rule, I figured it would be as good if not better than Jack and Jill. For starters, the entire book is lyrics that you follow with the accompanying CD. Some are OK at best, most are just DUMB. It does not capture my 4 1/2 y.o.'s attention at all. He flips through the pages of a Brookstone catalog with more interest. Would not recommend this at all. It sits on the shelf collecting dust."
4,Great Stand Alone,"This is a great stand alone eastern front documentary. If you are looking for a solid overview of the eastern front, this is your documentary. In America we skip the battle in the east and focus on the west, for obvious reasons. This documentary is worth your time. Great interviews. Get past the fact that this documentary was produced by the BBC."
2,Way too fast and vague explaination of dance moves,"I agree with the others that Tina teaches a VERY fast. She also does not explain where to put your arms, legs in the some of the segments so you need to rewind, rewind, rewind to get it right. I do have 10 years of dance training and even I found it very hard to keep up! When I am going through the moves, I am thinking in the back of my mind....wait where does my leg go on this count? Where do my arms go? It is a bit tricky to get the hang of the moves. Dance choreography is NEVER taught as fast as Tina teaches it. I am sure her back up dancers went through a few sessions before the video aired to get it right. It's impossible to do it otherwise! This video is definately not for beginners. It is best for people who have some dance training, but even then it is a bit difficult to master because the teaching is unlike any dance class you have ever gone to! Way to fast, and vague explaination of dance moves...even for me."
3,too fast!,"This DVD is like one long session of music videos with the instructor talking inbetween each music video. The counts of 8 were taught way too fast so I found myself rewinding constantly just to figure out what they were doing. I would recommend this DVD to someone who is already trained in dance who might want to learn the moves of the videos. Otherwise for beginners it's not too great a DVD. In addition to that, you need a fair bit of floor space to do these routines. For someone like me with an average sized living room, it wasn't too great. I moved all my furniture off to the side but still had trouble bumping into things."
4,taking a chance from abroad...,"i have to say i took a chance by purchasing thid dvd since there is no video preview available, but i'm actually glad i did... i won't say it's the best video ever, but it sure is a useful tool for those with a certain sense of rythm and/or some experience with teaching... i find it very convenient that tina keeps on warning the viewer when it's a good moment to rewind the video, and this matches each track and coreography segment...after reviewing the steps, she puts it all together with music so you can check what it'll look like... camera moves are quite ok, leaving room for an overall view of what happens on stage...again, i took a chance on it by buying a copy from caracas, venezuela, and i'm quite glad i did..."
1,not for beginners,"I got this dvd to work out to, hoping dancing would be more fun. I don't dance normally, and i'm not very good at it. She went way too fast for me to follow, so instead of a workout i had to stop and try to figure out what she was doing frame by frame. with a little one in the house i don't have time to take half an hour to try and learn the steps this way, she doesn't explain them well enough. so if you are more experienced with dancing then this is perfect, otherwise don't waste your money."
4,Semi-Great Pop CD,"I am writing this while I listen to the ""Vertigo"" CD for the second time. It is a pretty damn good disc. I especially like the guitar work on ""Never Let You Go"", ""Wanted To Be Wanted"" and "" Love Is Blind""I think if got some air play it would sell as it is a little more adult orientated as opposed to all the bubble gum pop that is out now.I think that with a little bit of promotion this CD could be a hit on the adult contemporary charts as the lyrics and vocal are very good not to mention the guitar playing of Alex De Rosso on lead. To bad it is not on a larger label."
4,Semi-Great Pop CD,I think that with a little bit of promotion this CD could be a hit on the adult contemporary charts as the lyrics and vocal are very good not to mention the guitar playing of Alex De Rosso on lead. To bad it is not on a larger label.
2,Annoying little CD,"Well, there's pretty much one Agricantus Cd available -- ""Best of Agricantus"". I really enjoy their music, so I hunted down ""Hale Bopp Souvenir""... and ... it's really annoying. It's only four songs, and three of them (with different titles) are on the ""Best of"" CD, and the other one isn't all that good.I'd only recommend buying this one if you're a real completist."
4,Not Tea Bags,"Although I do like this product, and am happy with it, I was surprised to find that they are not tea bags. Instead, they are individual serving size packets of crystals that dissolve in water (hence being ""instant""). Contains a lactose base."
5,excellent book,"I am an MBA student and I found this book extremely good for understanding the basics. It explains a lot of basics, terms and theories in simple words. A must have for anybody who has an interest in economics. In fact I would even recommend Susan Lee's ""ACZ's of Money and Finance"""
3,a wonderful resource for brass,"I have owned this CD since it first came out, and I go through long periods of not listening to it, then other times when I play it over and overr to decipher the message inside. At the time of it's release I learned of the collector's interest through an article in Smithsonian Magazine, and I was intrigued.I play trumpet, ever since fourth grade. ( I am now 55 years old, you do the math). My ears perk up whenever I hear a trumpet on the radio. Like most brass players I am intrigued by the idea that brass is a worldwide genre. Hows did this come about? it i a legacy of colonialism.Lomng before Paul Simon, Long before Putumayo, the collector of this CD was traveling to the far corners of the globe documenting the evolution of brass bands....."
4,Frozen Brass 1: Asia,"An intriguing survey of the mingling of musical styles between the brass band music that was introduced to Asian nations in colonial times and the native traditions of these countries. While the brass instruments themselves have remained in use, often the music performed on them has evolved beyond recognition from the original western styles."
4,nice,this product is priced very nice. i like it because it keeps me from burning my coffee table with my teapot.
5,Breathtaking brilliance,"Heard some of this on the radio and ran right out to get it - words fail me. It's the finest album I've heard in years, and defies description. It's thrilling to discover a new favorite! Funny, moving, baffling and gorgeous. Inspired work... wow."
3,One Cent Sale!,"The Third of the Furthur Festival Trilogy.Well, it is the weakest of the Three CD's devoted to The Furthur Festivals of the Late 1990's. But, you do get a couple of Tracks by: The Other Ones, ""Ramble On Rose"" & ""Easy Answers"". Bruce Hornsby does: ""Loser"". Ziggy, weighs in with two: ""Beautiful Day"" & ""Natural Mystic"". But for me a chance to hear anything by: Jazz Is Dead, would reel me right into the thick of this, and their Rendition of ""Eyes Of The World/Two Sisters"", is the Crown of these Thorns. And tacked on as the Last Track is a Guy called Paul Pena {Who?} featuring the guitars of a Guy named Jerome Garcia.All Three of the Furthur CD's are being given away by the Vendors for as little as a PENNY! Check your Pockets now, Grab all of em' up...Bet you find something real good on each one of them that will make you Smile. And, isn't that the Reason we all went down this Long, Long Road in the First Place?"
2,just ok,i was alittle dissapointed with this release. there really is no substitute for the real thing.!!the hi point is the jazz is dead stuff.
2,randomness,"with the exception of loser, ramble on rose, and easy answers this cd is a random collection of not so good tunes. If I want to hear Marley I will listen to Bob not his kids. Jazz is dead does eyes of the world but it's studio and off their second album. Nothing new. The Paul Pena song really has me upset. Where did it come from? Very upsetting cd considering that the original furthur was outstanding/"
4,One of Hayward's Best,"Susan Hayward stars in this biography of Lillian Roth, a talented singer pushed into the spotlight by her stage mother, and when she is unable to deal with her insecurities and the tragedies in her life, she turns to alcohol. It's one of those roles that every actress must dream of getting, and Hayward really sinks her teeth into it. She goes from glamour to degradation, with a very realistic portrayal of Roth's descent into alcoholism. She puts everything into it, and her performance is forceful and truthful. Jo Van Fleet is also terrific as her grasping mother, too eager to give her daughter the life she never had, and her scenes with Hayward are among the best in the film. It must have taken a lot for Roth to write her life story and let it be filmed, but she has in Hayward an actress that lays bare the painful honesty and ultimate courage of her struggle. It's a tribute to Roth and to the fine work done at Alcoholics Anonymous."
3,"Good, but Not Great","This is a movie that is marred by slow-paced direction at times, bogging the movie down.The performances are o.k. but Susan Hayward, who I love dearly mind you, is a bit over the top in this. She does her own singing in this and is not dubbed (as she was in With a Song in My Heart). This is another hindrance, however. Hayward's deep, throaty vocals fall flat at times. Its her performance that counts however and she turns in a fine one (although I prefer her Angelica Evans in Smash-Up).The movie gets a little frustrating at times because one finds it hard to feel much sympathy for Roth as she is her own worst enemy. But such is the case with most alcoholics.The supporting cast is fine as well.THis makes for a good movie but I feel that the potential for it to have been great went unfulfilled."
5,HAYWARD IS FANTASTIC!,"I watched this last weekend and was mesmerized by Hayward's performance. Her portrayal of Lillian Roth's descent into alcoholism was so realistic, it was frightening."
5,Susan Hayward knocks it out of the ballpark again,"Not to give the story plot away but this is an intense movie about stage mothers, great success, and a person that goes to the height of stardom only to dive deep down in the murky abyss of alcohol, only to rise up again. This has all the elements of an all too real problem many people face in life, whether you are a celebrity or not. If there are any substancea abusers in your family, this is the movie to watch."
5,This is a commitment,"If you want to know the women of Azerbaijan went through how deep and bitter life for their lives, for their children and freedom, this is a perfect CD. I was shocked when I found it and I listened to it after 20 years."
2,"Why, Why, Why???","I love Randy Travis, and I have yet to find a bad album in his discography. That's why I hate to include this in his discography.To me, this is kind of like an ""unauthorized"" release. It just doesn't fit with the rest of his material. And yes, that is weird to me, since this is basically a greatest hits cd.But getting down to business. Randy is in good voice here, and he does the best he can. This is just another night on stage, with the same old songs.I wish he would have forgotton about a live release and went ahead and waited and had another studio album.This is one of those cds you will buy, listen to a few times, then find under the seat of your car, and think to yourself, ""I forgot I had this.""Just pass this one on by."
2,Mediocre,"I was disappointed when I received my copy of this book. While it can be useful to see the Heidelberg and Westminster Shorter catechisms side-by-side, this edition leaves something to be desired. It is a rather poor translation of the Heidelberg Catechism, and neither catechism has the 'scripture proofs' that are in most editions. These 'scripture proofs' are one of the most useful features of these catechisms, and their absense diminishes the value of this text. You'd probably be better off buying these two catechisms individually and putting them next to each other yourself."
2,Shady title,"Advertised as ""pack of 20""', even includes 70.00 list price, reasonable for a pack of 20. Product as described otherwise. Please, fix this."
1,Do not buy,Not the correct quantity.. Listed as 20. Received one. If you look at the company's other feedback this is common for them. Seems fishy.
4,Niiiiiiiiice,"I bought this CD on a hunch at a used music store for $4, not knowing what I was getting myself into. What I heard when I finally popped it into my stereo was a great selection of downbeat tracks - all very smooth but always upbeat enough to keep you from drifting off. Great dinner party/chill music for when you've had enough of your Air's or Zero 7's. In my opinion, an underappreciated gem of the field."
4,Alexkid - Bienvenida,"Alexkid's debut album compiles a few tracks from his earlier EPs with some new compositions into a curious hybrid of deep house, funk, and downtempo. Some of the better tracks are ones that appeared previously (the glittering and bright ""Esmeralda,"" the deep house/drum 'n' bass combo of ""Night Lines""), but the darkness of ""Not Every Angel"" makes that a standout as well."
5,raid its perfect windows vista compatibility,excelent hdd for a gamer systems its not a fast like one on one wd raptor but it very cheap and you can buy 2 for raid 0 an knout the raptor speed
4,For my purposes,"this has worked well. Use it around the house with my Ridgid brad nailer, haven't tried the included nailer. It's light, easy to carry around, even for those small jobs where you don't want to carry much. No problems. Loudness is in the ear of the beholder but I certainly don't expect quiet from a compressor so would say this is average in that regard. [...] So far so good would be my evaluation."
2,Short life,"Don't buy, I have had this compressor about 2 years and used it for about 15 hours for filling tires, sports equipments, and putting in baseboards. It currently will not pressurize and the brad nailer puts a dent right below the nail."
3,Pretty good but ultra loud,"Bought this about four years ago and have worked it harder than the manufacturer intended and it still keeps going. I've not only used the included brad nailer, I've also connected it to 3"" framing nailers and even used it to install a thousand square feet of hardwood flooring. When using it with bigger nails you have to work fairly slow for the compressor to keep up but that is just fine for us amateurs. I was skeptical of the quality at first but it has proven to be of fairly good quality. If it wasn't for the INCREDIBLY LOUD volume when it is running I would give it 5 stars but you need ear plugs when you are near it. Just for that reason I would say find another compressor."
4,"Good compressor, not sure about the nailer","I primarily bought the kit for the compressor and to have a spare nailer. The compressor works great. It actually is built a lot better than I had anticipated. The nailer feels kinda cheap but in the case my main nailer breaks, it will work."
4,Great for the money and nice size too.,"I got this compressor/nailer/stapler combo for exactly what it's designed for.....small jobs. And so far it works great for what I've used it for. I used the nailer/stapler with a larger compressor though and it worked perfectly without any problems. I have not used the nailer/stapler with the compressor it came with but I would assume it should be fine, albeit with more frequent filling cycles. I've used the compressor for small jobs such as filling small tires on dollys, bikes, and occasionally to top off a vehicle tire when it was necessary. It was nice to not have to lug around a long hose from my bigger garage compressor and this compressor fills the bill just fine. I did purchase a longer coiled hose for it though. Overall I'm quite pleased with both the compressor and nailer/stapler. I did buy this on Black Friday for only $49 at a local big box store so I feel it was a steal for what it does."
3,Compressor worth what you pay for it,"This inexpensive compressor and nailer kit is okay. It works, but needs to cycle on very often to maintain pressure and is really only suited to small jobs like brad nailing. For the money, it's an ok deal"
2,Great Service - Fair Product,"Qualified for free delivery and received the product in record time! Well packaged, appears to be adequate for minimal usage. Was expecting greater capacity from the two (2) stage tanks, but didn't hold enough air to fill 2 tires, and never reached more than about 75 pounds pressure. Gave it to a neighbor"
3,Campbell-Hausfeld two gallon compressor,"Although the unit is very portable, its recovery and therefore its usefullness are not very satisfactory. The unit is cute and should look good at my auction because it will be still like new."
3,good for a year but....,"This was a dependable compressor, for about a year. Then the compression just totally quit. The piston gasket, I think, is the weak link. I took it apart and it's a very simple one piston arrangement with a plastic gasket. To fix you have to order a whole new motor/piston part set, about 35 bucks. Not a crisis but I think it should have lasted longer, this was just moderate use. I replaced it with a Senco which, for about 40 bucks more, pumps up in about half the time and is half as loud. Just do the Senco I'd say."
1,Ended up returning it,"I had borrowed my neighbors Campbell Hausfeld 'Quiet Air' compressor & Bostitch Brad nailer. Campbell Hausfeld didn't make the exact model but the folks at CH said the compressor was as quiet as the one I used.Not even close! Very loud rattle. Not that much worse than many of the oil-free ones out there but not what I was expecting .The 'free' stapler was junk. It misfired about 5 times in the first 30 brads I fired. The Bostitch I was using never misfired. Plus it only fires 1 3/8 brads. W/ trim work you are going through 1/2 or 5/8 drywall to get to the stud. 1 3/8's doesn't go to farI ended up finding the CH Quiet Air compressor (FP2040 not FP2048 - it's replacement)on line for $130 and bought a reconditioned Bostitch 2"" brad nailer off of ebay. definitely worth the upgrade cost."
4,Great Product,"Never owned a compressor before, but worked with them for many years. This particular compressor is a great light duty unit. Works great for brad nailing and inflating. Motor kicks in a bit too often for my taste but for the price and purpose I'm using it for it's a great product."
3,Air compressor,"The air compressor I bought because of the brand name and I have used this brand before. However, the compressor did not work out of the box. The warranty service was quick and outstanding. I am satisfied with my purchase at this time."
4,Good price 99.,I bought this in homedepot for 144. I bought this in homedepot for 144.I bought this in homedepot for 144
1,The seller did not describe the device - an irresponsible seller,"compressor operates on 110v which is written in the sale so I had to buy another device to transform voltage to 220V. compressor works very poorly (ie, many small-power), which is also stated in the sale. all the essential features of the device are not highlighted and I am very unhappy with this equipment and the seller. therefore receives the lowest possible rating 1.If the seller is willing to disagree I return the device at any time that he wants his courier after depositing money in my account as a figure around 140dolara and of course bears all costs plus transportation"
3,Good looking but not a true dive watch!,When we placed the order for this item we were replacing an older watch of the same brand and model. The older watch was a 200 meter dive watch with a screw down crown. We assumed this one would be also. When it arrived we found that this model now is only 100 meters guaranteed and does not have the screw down crown so cannot be used safely as a dive watch. We kept the watch for it's looks but are disappointed about the model design change.
1,Not as shown in picture,Gold Colour on the strap of the watch is not as great as it was showing in the picture. Also dial finishing is not great
4,"Well made, good-looking and substantial watch","I researched Invicta before buying this watch (and along with one other Invicta) and I was impressed with their company. The look was exactly what I wanted as I was trying to replace a similar Seiko that quit after only 3 years of wear. It is bigger like the other reviews note, but I wanted more of a large men's style anyway. It's hefty, but feels great, keeps time perfectly and has a pretty mother-of-pearl face that is very subtle. The band is substantially constructed, too - not hollow and cheap links. I also like that Invicta stands by its 23K gold plating technique and claims that it is more durable than other types of plating (my seiko gold plate had faded). We'll see how it holds up, but overall I am really happy with the watch and feel that the value is unbeatable - it does look more expensive than it is."
4,great book,This book is perfect for anyone thinking about getting a bulldog or has just purchased one. Easy to read and well organized.
4,Full of information.,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It contains a lot of information on Bulldogs ranging from their history to grooming and the breed standard. One little complaint, it is full of tons of advertising. The authors really like Nylabones. It's still a very informative book about Bulldogs. I definitely recommend it if you're a new owner, like me!! (o:"
4,"Good, comprehensive",I own an olde English bulldog however I felt this book had very practical applications for raising and owning all bully breeds. Would recommend to a new bully owner as a good reference book.
5,Bulldog book,"We were first time bulldog owners and bought a one-year old male. I knew that they had a lot of health problems so I wanted to get a book that would help me to identify these problems. Sure enough our bulldog started showing health problems and I was able to look in this book to help us identify the problem. Not only is this a great book for learning about their health but it also gives information about their history, if a bulldog is right for you, how to train them and much more. Overall it's been a great book!"
1,Uggggghhhhh,"I must be an alien because most products I try, I get the total opposite intended effect.. I took one pill and became so high, calm and non motivated.. I just felt like lying in bed and staring into space.. No energy at all.... :-( I will be taking this at night as a sleeping pill!"
1,Garbage,Don't waste your time with lab made things. Mucana really does increase dopamine and it will help you feel better.
5,L-Tyrosine - The Friendly Amino Acid that Cures the Sleepies!!!,"When I moved to a state much higher in elevation than what I was use to, I turned to L-Tyrozine - a friendly amino acid that is naturally occurring in many foods. It helped me to deal with, if not overcome the grogginess during the first three months of acclimation to less oxygen. I also find myself using it when I adjust my sleeping patterns for a new job or new class schedule, or for daylight savings time. It works! I combine it now with NOW Foods Dopa Mucuna Mood Support. I always feel less sluggish, more happy with the combination, especially in the morning. I recommend both supplements for mood support and for an overall awake feeling without side effects or jitters.I swear by this stuff!"
4,happy with this,"So far, the tyrosine seems to be somewhat alleviating my muscle pain and also seems to be helping my energy level. I have low levels of dopamine and I don't know if this is helping with those levels but I am hoping so. Am very hopeful it is something that will work long term!"
2,did not work for me but...,"Tried this because I was feeling anti-social and isolating alot This increased my anxiety but at least let me know that my issue was not depression, but anxiety."
3,No change for me,"I haven't noticed any benefits, but I am continuing to take and I am considering increasing dosage. It seems ok."
1,Beware,"Beware of back acne! Or acne in general! I am not a typical victim of acne, at all. So, after a few days of taking this supplement, & noticing various acne popping up on my otherwise clear back & face, I stopped. Since I have stopped taking it, the acne has stopped, as well. No thanks!"
4,Saw on Dr Oz,Saw this supplement on Dr Oz as a way to boost metabolism if you are having trouble with hypothyroidism. Can't say for absolute certainty that my metabolism is better because I am also dieting at the moment but it sure seems like it to me. I will continue to use this product. It was suggested on the show to take 1500 mg twice a day on an empty stomach.
3,Tyrosine,I use this for preworkout along with many other things. I have not noticed much of a difference and probably won't be buying again.
3,What does this do?,Um I like Now products because they do work. You get what you pay for! I use this to calm myself but it makes me wayyyyy to sleepy so if you have problems falling asleep just take this early and at bed time you'll pass out!
4,Helpful,"I've been taking two capsules a day for the past 2 weeks and it has helped in several ways by increasing my energy levels, boosting my concentration and memory, controlling anxiety and perhaps helping out in the romance department ( I think). I now look forward to the helpful effects it provides every day."
2,No discernible improvement,I didn't notice a discernible improvement to my cognitive function. No improvement or effect was noticed throughout the consumption of the product. In fact I was rather disappointed that a cup of coffee outperformed this product.
2,Wast of money,"After trying this product I did not notice any improvement in the way I felt. Very disappointing investment, at least for me."
3,Great then nothing,Worked great the first couple days and then stopped working. For me works best if cycled. I took on an empty stomach first thing in the morning.
4,Works alongside L-dopa,"I take this 1-to-1 with L-Dopa, haven't tried by itself, but together they seem to help me keep from losing so many things all day long. Not a strong effect but better than nothing. 1 pill a day each."
4,The Ending is the Best!!!,"For an independent production, this things rocks. The story is amazing, the production values are great. And an ending you just don't see coming."
1,Getting Sutures Less Painful Than Watching this Movie,"I am convinced that the positive reviews are from people affiliated with the movie (or their friends). I enjoy a good B horror flick, but there was absolutely nothing remotely entertaining or redeemable about this movie. Felt like a high schooler's attempt at making a movie (and cafeteria friends who acted the role). The reviewer who noted the audio issues was exactly right. This may go down as the worst movie I've seen in all time. Would be PERFECT for Mystery Science Theater 3000, however, if it were still around! Under that circumstance a winner...In fairness, I could only stand this for about a half hour before turning it off. I should note I got it as a distraction while I needed to sip a disgusting prep for a colonoscopy the next day, and it still didn't fulfill its purpose! The prep was less aversive. Rent at your own risk! Wasn't worth the buck I paid at Redbox... Read the limited reviews with caution..."
5,Shocking Exposition of Sickness of Our Day,"Kierkegaard goes deep into our corrupted nature. In his pursuit, he relentlessly exposes our inner filth as no one else (save Christ himself) has done before. The book expresses most forcefully what it means to be a human being. Unlike other existentialist works, the remedy is provided."
5,The Best,"This is hands down the greatest book I have ever read, not including the Bible. I say that as a Christian and as an individual. I can understand how some choose to apply the concepts without the religion, but I personally think this would have infuriated SK.Again, not including the Bible, ""The Sickness Unto Death"" is perhaps the only literary work I have ever read that altered my life, either by perception or action.His elaborations on the various forms of despair should hit everyone, as there are several, each applicable to each personality.If anyone were to ask me to recommend a single work, this would be it.I must add, that I have not read scores of philosophy, only a handful. I say that to say this. This book may seem somewhat difficult to understand at first, but it gets easier the more you read and the more accustomed you get to SK's style. Once the first few pages regarding the definition of self have been comprehended, the rest falls beautifully into place."
3,For 1950s Fans,"I was not really impressed with these two movies. They lacked excitiment and depth.The stars of the 1950s are always good even in the rubbish scripts they had to act out.Jean Peters in Blue For Murder was excellent, She can do no wrong in my eyes. Please comeback Jean.Jack Palance the perfect face without make up, for Jack The Ripper.I like the 1950s there are still some great movies out there to released from this era."
5,A good blue print,"While I have not watched the companion movie, I highly recommend the blue print. This is an old style, very intelligently scripted, mystery and murder movie. Without any special effects or other superficial goodies the movie keeps you busy and anger to figure out the case. Acting by Joseph Cotten and Jean Peters are enjoyable. A nice, standard DVD transfer. Subtitled in Spanish, French and English."
4,"Pretty good story, but of no significant historical value.",It was a fairly good way of passing the evening. More could have been done to point to historical validity.
3,Enjoyable Double Bill,"'Blueprint for Murder' is a neat little thriller excelently performed by Joseph Cotten and the estimable Jean Peters (snatched from film by her marriage to Howard Hughes). 'Man in the Attic' is an atmospheric re-make of 'The Lodger': can creepy yet charming, soft-spoken Jack Palance be Jack the Ripper? Constance Smith is unexpectedly good as the music hall artiste who dallies with him."
3,Watchable,"2 watchable, especially since they are relatively short, B-movies with OK plots, decent acting, and each with a beautiful actress, Jean Peters (Blueprint for Murder)and Constance Smith (Man in the Attic)."
3,Barely a taste,"The Mighty Mighty Bosstones without doubt one of the most influential groups on the Skacore/Ska-Punk/whatever you call it scene. This album, however, only offers a quick dip into this band's music. If you are a fan of Ska or Punk this in not the right album for you to buy. If you have just heard of the Bosstones and wish to check them out, this album may be a good place to start. However, I would recommend that you buy a single release, such as Question the Answers. As with most good bands, the singles/popular songs are not always the best. This is not a CD for a Bosstones fan, not even a future one, it's barely a taste of the material the band can present."
3,buyer beware,"this is a comp from their albums from mercury. has some good stuff, but alot of their best stuff is left off this, even the good stuff from the mercury albums. i even think that this is mercury's attempt to cash in from mmb's fans. the way these companies work, i doubt the band will see a penny. check out the live cd, don't know how to party, question the answers, devil's nite out, and more noise & other disturbances."
4,A decent look into the band,"When I first got into these guys, I didn't know where to start, so I listened to this album. Compiling 12 of their so called ""Hits"" into a cd. My question is, how are the two covers on this cd be considered hits.With songs like ""Someday I Suppose"" and the almighty ""The Impression that I get"" there's gotta be at least one song on here you'll like. It's not this cd is bad, but it is a half A** attempt for their record company to bank off of the band. I mean come on now, 12 songs? They could have put like an extra 10 or 15 songs on the disc. Even the live album they released is better than this, because it has more songs and goes deeper into their fan favorites.I mean, I don't suggest this, but you should either download this off the internet for free or listen to the songs on youtube, because this is no attempt at actually looking into the band. Sure I loved this when I listened to this (I still kinda do though) but make sure you know what your getting when you buy this."
5,I bought two pans and thinking of buying another two more!,The pans work perfectly. It only takes me 7 mins to bake one batch but I have to clean it and bake again is too much hassle!
3,"Good, but full of errors","This is an amazingly comprehensive book. Looking past the near 200 page history of the Padres that this book includes, there is just simply a lot of information in this book. Overviews of exectuives, managers, and important players...50 pages of stats...list of trades the Padres have made over the years...and more. The only thing missing, in my opinion, is a section dedicated to Tony Gwynn.The biggest problem with this book, however, is the errors. There are spelling errors (including in the table of contents) and a lack of fluidity in format. But more importantly are the numerous factual errors: wrong birthdates, incorrect statistics, wrong information. My favorite example is on page 433, Best Road Record: 46-35, Fewest Road Losses: 37. And that is just an obvious one.A good book, but difficult to trust."
5,Another winner by Aliki!,"Aliki's gift for clarity, humor and cleverness shine through this wonderful book. It is, like all Aliki's books, loaded with information, but manages not to overwhelm. You will find yourself coming back to this book again and again, examining the pictures and finding details you hadn't noticed before. A marvelous introduction to Shakespeare for mid- to older elementary children (and a visual delight for even younger readers!)."
4,"Good book, but the old subtitle was better","The great myth of America is that you can be anything you want to be. And it's not a myth because of economic or social structures, but because God has not designed us to be anything we want to be. This book does an excellent job of emphasizing this fact and calling one to pursue not what others say we should but the specific design of our creator. That is why I believe the old subtitle is a better description of the book's thesis and frankly more provocative for a culture that has bought into the American myth."
5,This book changed the way I treat myself.,"This book describes the process of finding ideal work - work that is much more 'play' than a struggle, a job where 'I can't believe I get paid for this' is a reality. It is essential for anyone who is searching for a working lifestyle that is rewarding and fulfilling."
2,A great sleep aid,"The author’s background is made obvious based on the constant theme of psychological reasons some are risk averse. Many times she gets way into the weeds with this type of analysis. If I was a psychology student or one who works in that profession the book maybe more enjoyable, but I pretty much got nothing out of it. It’s not even a decent motivational book in terms of making you want to get started doing your own thing. There is better material out there."
2,I wish it was true,"This is an inspiring book for those privileged enough to be able to follow its philosophy. I imagine that for the person who does not need to be concerned with keeping a roof over their head and food on their table for the foreseeable future, this book could be a great help in setting a direction. If you don't need the money NOW, and if you can do what you love for long enough, then maybe money will follow .... but only if what you love to do happens to be something someone else is willing to pay for."
1,what is this book really about??????,"This book harps on a persons' upbringing and if there was enough encouragement, enthusiam and confidence given as a child... The author feels based on the manner in which the person was raised is relevant to their success...I kept reading ( painfully ) because I was sure somewhere there would be something relevant to the title. Reading this book was like a therapy session , that I did not request.."
5,Essential book to have,This book WILL absolutely help any person find their way. It gives career advice and great life advice. It is a wonderful gift for anyone who feels stuck in their current job and anyone who is ready to branch out. EXCELLENT BOOK! EXCELLENT AUTHOR!
5,Great Book,This is an inspirational and motivating book. Highly recommended for anyone considering a career change or to revitalize your career goals.
2,bland,"perhaps it's the fact that the author who narrates her own book has a very monotone, flat voice--this is the disadvantage to an audiobook--you have the voice and tone qualities to factor in also--which isn't entirely fair. i found it bland and heard my mind replying ""yeah, but we know that--that's why i bought the book!"" anyway, there is a man who asks her questions and she responds--audio interview format--"
2,Misleading title,"I gave this book two stars not because of the writing, but because the title is misleading. If you're looking for courage to quit your high-paying but soulless job for more soulful work--and maintain your standard of living--this book won't deliver.Perhaps a better title would be DO WHAT YOU LOVE, THE MONEY WON'T MATTER. That would set a reader's expectations more in line with the book's message. The cases in the book were not monetarily successful. However, they show that if you follow your heart, the money won't matter. The things that money can buy when working a soulless career, such as vacations, clothes, cars, and so on lose their appeal as a reward, because what you DO is the reward. You no longer need what money can buy because you have what money can't buy: love."
4,It takes courage to act on what we value,"An outstanding guide to tuning into your inner world and unique talents. Dr. Sinetar is an organizational psychologist, mediator and writer. She advises us to identify the things that light us from within. ""It takes courage to act on what we value and to willingly accept the consequences of our choices."" Ten chapters chock full of new ideas, great advice and soul searching that satisfies."
3,No laughing matter,I really want to love this but the laugh track is EXTREMELY annoying. Why did they add the canned laughs? The laugh track ruined it. I can't really judge the rest of the content because I can't get past this.
1,Not my cup of tea,"I have loved British comedy for years, but this one does not appeal to me at all. I watched the first episode and will not be watching any more. I understand this show has a ""cult"" following. I'm sorry to say, I just don't get it. I was hoping for a new, fun lighthearted Britcom and was disappointed with the blatant attempts at weirdness and the coarse, adolescent humor. I'll find my way back to the classic sitcoms. What a huge let down."
3,Disturbingly Amusing,"I remember seeing some of the episodes contained on this DVD, on cable television. I watch way too much t.v., so something has to be pretty original to stand out in my mind. This series is definitely unique, in its willingness to explore characters that suffer from a variety of disorders and compulsions, from cannabalism to anal retentiveness (literally), from poorly-executed transvestism to consistent unemployability. In format, it reminds me of the Canadian series Kids in the Hall. If you like sketch comedy with recurring characters, and mildly obscene BBC-style stuff, this might just be for you."
1,Not for your average viewer . . . .,"I just wanted to warn those contemplating this purchase that we found nothing whatsoever funny in the 3 episodes we suffered through. This is not different just because its 'British humor', because we own and enjoy several sets of BBC comedies. I think this will be enjoyed only be a select few."
1,Should have negative stars,"Truly, not funny. One of the most repulsive television shows ever. Throwing shock after shock at the viewer does not equal funny. This series has no heart.One more thing. From the BBC site: ""Although there's a laughter track, it's hardly noticeable."" They lie."
1,"""boring and perverted""","I recently became the unfortunate owner of ""The League of Gentlemen-The Complete Series"".There is not really too much to say about itexcept that it is boring,perverted and disgusting.We forced ourselves to watch about an hours worth of it,but that's all we could stand(believe me,we're no prudes).Anyone want to buy the set?"
2,Gripless Tale,"Having enjoyed Brian Wood's work on Channel Zero, I had no problem spending the money to pick up Couscous Express. I ended up being pretty disappointed with this comic's listless tale of an unlikeable girl who can't seem to ruin lives fast enough.As a whole, the story feels very shallow and trivial. There was little emotion put into this book. The plot is very obvious, and the characters seem to have no interest in what they're doing.The art is decent, but stylistically changes at random for seemingly no reason.Be warned, just pass."
5,Affordable kit with the most couplers for the money,"This kit ends up costing as much as 1 or 2 standalone plugs, but you get 6 plugs and a coupler. Lots of other kits only include 1:1 ratio of plugs and couplers which seems odd to me. This is the best kit if you just need more plugs for new tools."
2,misleading discription,The movie is only in Italian. The actor's voice's have been replaced with Italian voice overs. This kinda ruin it for me.
3,It is a movie I watched.,"One of the better movies about a hole. Before you go out to dig your own hole, watch this movie."
4,Teen movie,My daughter rented this. She seem to like it. Made for a good family movie night. Don't think id own it. More of a good rental.
2,Do not waste your time.,"This movie falls into my top 20 worst movies of all time. I can't believe I sat through the entire movie. Please, please please consider almost any other movie before you watch this one."
2,Not worth a rental,"I can't think of anyone I would recommend this to. Very low budget looking with not a lot happening. Pass on this one, I wish I did."
4,Pretty Good,"A good child friendly horror film but don't let that turn you off from the movie. Its like a movie version of Are You Afraid of the Dark or an R. L. Stein book. Very creepy, kinda humorous at times, ok story, predictable and all in all a good movie. As for those complaining about their dvds I rented the movie and it was fine and in English, its not the movie, some how your getting foreign versions of the film on dvd. I would suggest this movie to anyone."
1,Be careful to read the 'Region' warning,"It turned out this DVD was for another region, and unusable!In fairness, on reviewing the ad, I see that they did in fact disclose that fact.Apparently, the waring wasn't prominent enough for me :-)So, be warned, not compatible with use in the US!!!!!"
2,Very very PG more so then Gremlins,"Read the title of my review and that's why I give this a two star rating.Not very objective on my part but I don't like watching movies for kids and this is where this one lines up.Besides that not badly done but just very PG and kinda falls in with movies like spiderwick chronicles only not as engrossing.Gremlins kicks the hole's butt any day.It's OK if you have twelve year olds to entertain but they might even complain about the watered down ""horror"" movie they are watching.Maybe this was meant for six year olds instead.Like I said I can't gripe about the acting or storyline and it did have me going at the beginning but it just falls apart into mediocrity so hard it's kinda difficult to maintain an interest.This review is horribly biased (but hey at least I admit it) but had I an inkling of what was in store for me renting this I would've of course not rented it period."
3,Braid Reincarnated!!!,"Cheer up, emo kids!! Braid is back, the name has changed but the musics the same. 3/4 of Braid has reformed under the title of hey mercedes. This four song EP is just a taste, but you know what it sounds like. Robert Nanna's distinctive voice is all you need to hear to know that this isn't a trick. Get it!!"
4,yOu CAn bE so cOLd,"hey guys...no this is not braid...i was in braid....ok, well, i'm a guy pretending to be chris broach, and chris broach was in braid.....i'm just wondering what is the big idea here? looks like braid didn't break up, just lost me!!!....ok, no, for real, this is not braid...it's braidish but different but really good....more of the powerpoprock sort than braid....they are just getting started and who knows what monster they will become....all four songs are so great you forget chris is gone....bob is a star....i mean all four songs are so great you almost forget I'M gone...oops....i'm just trying to figure out why i'm not in the band anymore....i could've totally yelled YEAH a couple of times on these songs.......oh well...."
4,Four great songs,"It's good to see that 3/4 of Braid has gone on to great things. On this EP, there are lots of similarities to Braid (just compare ""St. James St."" to ""Collect From Clark Kent"" off of Frame And Canvas), but Hey Mercedes also sets out into their own sonic territory. The witty lyrics and biting guitars are still here, but Hey Mercedes sticks to more traditional rhytms and song structures. The hooks aren't as strong as they could be in a couple of tunes, but for a first recording this is great. Highly recommended if you enjoy earlier Promise Ring or newer emo bands such as Brandtson."
5,"Hey Mercedes ""picks up where braid left off""","Yeah chris broach is gone, but it doesn't matter--rob nanna's voice has gotten better. ""stay six"" ""the house shook"" and ""st james street"" all succeed on several levels. buy it, on the real."
5,Keep Going!!!,"It's new, it's full, and I will probably keep it with my other Braid and Head East albums."
5,"From the author, James Badal - Der Drache erwacht","I appreciate Mr. Beveridge taking the time to ""review"" my book ""In the Wake of the Butcher."" I must point out, however, that his allegation that I ""ultimately dismiss"" Dr. Francis Edward Sweeney as the prime candidate in the series of murder-dismemberments is simply not true. No one who read my book carefully could possibly come to that conculsion. Of course, with over 1,500 online reviews to his credit, Mr. Beveridge probably has precious little time for any sort of reading, careful or otherwise."
4,In the Wake of the Butcher,"I enjoyed this book very much, especially having grown up in the Cleveland area. I find the authors style of writing very easy to read. I am very fascinated with this crime, more so since it has never been solved. It is a good read if you like true crime mysteries."
5,Dairy farming in southern Ontario,"Although published 15 years ago, Home Farm is still an informative account of the day-to-day workings of a southern Ontario dairy farm."
5,A great gift for a 6 and 3 year old,"I got this for my 6 1/2 and 2 1/2 year old daughters. It's a GREAT toy. Even since we set it up after Christmas, it's been played with for 30-60 minutes every day. That's got to be a record! It took about 20 minutes to put together using one of the three sample designs. I put it together on an area rug and it's pretty stable, though my youngest likes to reach for the marbles as they go down, so minor tweaks are sometimes necessary. The marbles that work with this marble run are slightly smaller than your standard sized marble, so make sure you keep track of them. I'd highly recommend this toy without hesitation."
2,FRAGILE,"This marble run is great for kids that a very careful with their toys. We bought this set in November and almost immediately pieces started cracking and breaking. It just isn't durable. Today, I threw the whole thing in the garbage.If you don't mind spending the cash on something that won't last. Go for it. It was fun while it lasted.It just didn't last long enough to suit me."
5,Creative fun!,"My 6-year old got this toy for Christmas and loves it! You can build marble runs from the guide, or create your own. It's easy to use, allows kids to build jillions of different runs, and they can really get creative building with this. This is one of his favorite toys!"
1,Buy something else!,"I went against my instincts and ordered this for my 9-year-old daughter's ""Santa"" present. I should have listened to some of the other reviews and bought something else. Anything else would have been better. She really wanted a fun marble track that would allow her to build in all kinds of configurations. This was flimsy and could barely be assembled at all without falling over. Really poor design and construction. I rarely take the time to review items, although I always read them before I buy, but this was SO BAD I felt I had to write a review. I will say I received great customer service from Amazon and received a full refund of the purchase price and shipping without any hassle. That was the only good part of the experience."
3,Quercetti 224 pc marble run,Need to have space to leave set up as it takes awhile to assemble. Fun to watch....drives our cat crazy. Regular sized marbles will not fit this run...only came with a few.
4,Great toy - age limit is 8+,"The reason I mention the age limit in the description is that several people have complained that their 5 year olds cannot assemble this. This is a more mature product as the manufacturer suggests. 8+.I had issues with some of the parts. The round about (wire frame) pieces took a lot of tweaking. For an older kid, no problem. However I built this for my toddler (because he LOVES the marbles) so fi scaled it down to just the solid tracks and drops. it works great.Here is my suggestion. This thing is like temperamental Legos. If you don't have patience (and some creativity) - then don't get it. The instructions are only semi-directional. If you have some patience and like to tinker (or your 8+ year old does), then this is the product for you. I love it, my toddler loves it."
2,Not the best,The yellow swirls that the marbles go on do not work. The angles are not right and the marbles get suck on it. I was disappointed in this product. I would not buy again. It works fine if you don't use the yellow swirls.
3,Cheap Construction and build feel,"I have to say this is a really fun toy to play around with, but the plastic cheap feel really bothers be. Also you need 3 pieces to use build one bridge or tunnel taking away the total number of pieces listed by the manufacturer. But it is fun, maybe just purchase from another builder...."
5,Great building kit with lots of fun.,"This is a great building kit with lots of fun. At first when I opened the shipping box, the box inside seemed quite beaten up. I opened it, many parts inside was loose, as if someone had gotten this particular product and then returned it. However, I proceeded to count every part and found that not only was all the parts there, there were even some extra parts! This is a Christmas gift for my grandson, so at this time, he hasn't seen it yet, but even I am anxious to help him put it together and have fun!"
4,Good toy but could be more durable,"I have purchased this toy to my 8 years old son. I had to assemble myself, it was too complicated for him, he did not even touch it but helped to hand me the pieces and watched me doing it. It took about an hour to complete and it wasn't too hard. My only problem is that structurally it's not solid enough, it's almost impossible to move it without bending and displacing the stands. The toy is okay."
4,Excellent fun!,We bought this for our ever inquisitive daughter and she loves it. She enjoys the fun of putting it together & the educational value assoicated with it.
1,Cheaply made,Bought this toy for our 8 year old daughter.made with the cheapest plastic available and impossible to stand up. Very disappointed. Will be returning this item
5,Great fun!,"This marble run is a lot of fun. My seven year old son received it for Christmas last year, and he has played with it many times since then. Every time we have friends over, they want to play with the marble run. My son can build the designs on the box by himself, but needs some help building designs from scratch. Fortunately I enjoy playing with it too!"
1,Very Disappointed,"Could have been a great creative toy, but VERY flimsy. Parts were not sturdy enough to stand and hold the track for the marble to run. Was birthday present for grandson. We were both disappointed"
3,"My 8 Yr old loves to build things like this; but, only once so far.","As mentioned in the title, my 8 year old loves building things like this; so, I am surprised he has only built it up one time since its arrival approximately three/four weeks ago. As for a description of the product, there are many pieces which is why I prompted my son to choose this one amongst the selection of others. It does as it is supposed to do; however, it would be better if the pieces were more solid so as to make it more sturdy upon a completed structure. Honestly, I don't know that I would spend my personal dollars on it; but, this happened to be a product my son spent his own saved dollars on."
3,Room for Improvement,"I bought this as a gift for my nephew, who is quite likely younger than the target for this toy. He was able to snap things together and have fun with the setup. I was disappointed in the product for two reason: 1) I bought a set of ""regular"" marbles to go along with it, and the marbles were too big for the tubes...or rather the tubes were too small. 2) Each connecting ""transition"" required multiple pieces to snap together to make a single transition. Although not too complicated, it was more complicated than the set I grew up loving."
4,useful book.,"Edred Thorsson is most noted for his work in the areas of Teutonic magic. This book represents a crossover in research and as a result the book is not as well researched as his other books. That being said, the book is one of the best books on Ogham divination at its time and continues to be a solid book today."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"This does touch the very core and essence of the world of fetish fashion, but there's so much left out.Robin Cay Noorda does a great job of photographing creations of fetish designer Doesjka Bramlage, but again, alot if left out. If you just want to see pictures then this book is for you, but if you want a real insight than look elsewhere. There's alot of good books out there about fetish, this is not one one of them. A far better book is "" Horn madness"". I read this book and did not find it interesting, helpful, educational or interesting."
4,A tad bit over the top with the effects,"Overall, I recommend this movie to anyone interested in what happened in Fatima in 1917 but understand this movie could have been better. I would have like to have seen less of the artistic effects and more of an actual straight story. Though I agree the black and white adds to the overall feel of the movie, I also believe the different camera angles and glow effects take away from the movie. The acting by children is well done.It is worth seeing and I am glad to have it in my collection."
3,Not what I expected,"Perhaps I was misinformed, but I thought this was supposed to be the definitive movie on Fatima. It isn't. There are many gaps in the story and the message. Don't get me wrong, it is beautifully made and moving. But it is certainly not what I expected."
3,Disappointing,"I was not impressed by this film. Yes, it was very pretty and the special effects were nice - but in film you have to be able to tell a story and tell it well. This film failed do that. It did not hold my interest. The characters were merely sketched in. The camera work was distracting. For example;there were too many close ups. I did not need to become intimately acquainted with each actor's eyebrows and lips. It was like ""Citizen Kane"" meets ""Song of Bernadette"".In addition, the storyline was hard to follow as it proceeded in fits and starts. If I had not read several books about Fatima I would not have known what the heck was going on. All in all it seemed amateurish to me. I really wanted to like this film. I yearn for good, uplifting, family entertainment. But honestly, I think the old Hollywood movie did a much better job of telling the story,even if they did make up some of it."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"I LOVE the story of Fatima and have read almost all credible books on it so when I had heard and read the great reviews on the DVD I ordered it right away. My disappointment is that the film doesn't show the sacrifices of the children such as forgoing their lunches and offering them to the ""poor children"", going without water, wearing a rough rope, etc...as offerings to God in reparation for sinners. The film gave a very basic story. I understand that it was not made with the funding a large producer would have but I feel it didn't show the real spiritual change in those very young children as a result of the apparitions."
5,Great!,Great movie. You have to watch the bonus feature in the CD which a Franciscan priest explains the 3 secrets and how important to love God.
3,"Pretty ok, not as good as older films","Just ok, the movie is not great in my opinion. Older versions of the same movie are much better in terms of acting and other things, even the black and white ones. Still a very good message with great explanation by a priest at the end."
4,omissions,"Good mix of black and white ,The children are older than was the case ,Dialogue was spoken in a stilted manner .The narrator was fatter in reality ,An Angel appeared to the children before Our Lady did , I would have preferred it if it was more true or even documentary rather than drematic .Now , let me watch it again ."
1,Too much hype,"I love Catholic Movies. I love Fatima and the Blessed Virgin Mary. I did not love, or even like this film. Very artistic without a story-line. If someone is not familiar with Fatima, they will have difficulty following the movie. The old movie ""Our Lady of Fatima / The Story of Fatima"", while not completely accurate or historically correct, was a much better movie and one could forgive those directors for artistic license."
2,Boring film,"This film seems to me to be very superficial, relying more on cinamatography than fact. It is a conglomerate of black and white, shadowy scenes which, low and behold, just as in The Wizard of Oz, change into color at the appearance of the Blessed Mother. Boring, Boring, Boring!"
5,13th day !!!!,great movie!!!4 stars....we need more well made christian movies to inspire our youth...two big thumbs up!!!!!!!!
5,Great movie on Fatima,"A great movie of Fatima. Its short (85 min) so it doesn't have a lot of details of the apparition but the story is great.Its made in a strange/artistic way. Most of it is in black and white, and there is a lot of blur (intentional) throughout. I think its to make it more dramatic. I like it, others may find it annoying.Overall, a great and inspirational movie. I recommend it and would buy it again."
1,"Ok, apparently I'm a complete idiot.","The item is fine ... exactly as pictured and arrived in a reasonable time, etc. But $10.75 shipping for a 3 oz package? Next time I will pay more attention to shipping costs ... and I will never use this vendor again."
5,Great gift,"I gave this to my roommate for Christmas, and she said that it worked very well, that the dough didn't stick to the mold, and that the brioche baked evenly. Definitely great value for the price."
3,Immune support,"My rating is a little tricky. Immune advantage was awesome when i was using it. I used to get sick all the time, then I started taking this pill and I stopped getting sick. I only took it when others were sick around me, when i started to feel bad, and I took it the entire flu season. I used this product for a year and a half and didnt get sick! Unfortunately, it wore off. This is why I couldn't give it 5 stars. My body got used to it and it was effective any longer. I stopped using it but, I have to say I would use it all over again if I needed it. Thank goodness I don't get sick like I used to, now I just take a vitamin c. If you get sick a lot, I think you should definitely buy this product!"
4,good product,ive been using colostrum for a few years now and it helps keep my immune level up. the prices on amazon a much cheaper than the local vitamin store.
2,Oster Toaster,"Having happily owned a white Oster Toaster for 15 years it was time for an upgrade to Stainless Steel. I read all the bad reveiws and decided to try it anyway. Although the look of this toaster is pleasing, the function is not. It does not toast evenly regardless of the placement or settings. Some of the heating coils in the front slot do not work, thus the unevenness. The back slot seems to do the best, but one side of the toast gets well toasted and the other side is only slightly toasted. I can't use the left side of the front slot since the coils only partially work. Very dissappointing."
1,Garbage,"I received this as a present and boy am I happy I didn't spend my own money on it.This thing is so thinly made that the outside gets hot enough to burn during the first use. Also, the piece of metal that holds the toast in the toaster isn't a wide as the slot, so pieces of bread are constantly falling off to the side and getting stuck. Sound fun yet?I've used this for almost 2 months and I have yet to get it to toast well. No matter what I set it on, the first try will always come out untoasted or well underdone. If I push it down for a second go at that same setting, it always comes out burnt black. Even if I can get it to toast somewhat well on the first try, the edges of my bread are always burnt black.This piece of garbage is on it's way to Goodwill. Here's hoping you don't buy it."
1,Don't waste your money,"It quit working after 6 months. Well, I shouldn't say completely quit working. It heated up just fine but would not shut off and pop up the toast when it was done. It burned everything. I threw it out for fear of fire."
1,only toasts 1 side at a time,i purchased this toaster and i am now looking to replace it ...it only toasts things on 1 side and i have to babysit it and eject it b4 its done and flip it to toast the other side...what a pain in the neck...i did not read the all the ratings ...i wish i did ...this is a piece of junk... do not buy it !!!i didnt even want to give it a star at all but the format would not allow a no star review
4,Pretty good toaster,"I don't usually write reviews, but....this was the toaster I really wanted because of its relatively slim profile for a 4 slicer, however I read many reviews of this toaster and was almost scared off. Then I went to a great deli nearby and saw they had 5 of these toasters for their business. They bought this toaster to accommodate large bread slices such as rolls and large slice sourdough. They'd been using the toasters for a couple of months without issue and stated they seem to work fine.....pretty even toasting. Began to think if it is good enough for their business it is probably good enough for my kitchen.So I finally bought one and have been very pleased to date (3 weeks). Great to have a four slicer, toast large rolls, hot dog buns, etc. The only complaint I have is that when the bread pops up the toaster sounds kind of cheap in that the cage makes a hollow rattling sound when compared to my old Cuisinart toaster.Otherwise very happy so far."
1,Should have read the reviews,We have had ours less than one year and we hate it for all the reasons everyone else have listed. It doesn't toast evenly etc. Don't buy it.
2,I agree - not a great toaster,I'd just like to second what most everyone is saying here: this toaster produces very uneven toast. The center top toast faster than the rest. If you run a second batch of toast it will come out darker than the first batch.I'll give it two stars because it handles long pieces of bread well.
3,Need more time to figure out the settings,"You'd think that operating a toaster would be as simple as popping in a piece of bread and pushing down the lever. Not so with this one. If you enjoy toast bordering on charcoal, use this toaster without reading the instructions first. For light toast, you push 'toast' and set the dial at the lowest possible setting. Go to '3' and you're eating ashes. My poptarts faired no better. The middle gets warm while the edges burn. My daughter loves the toaster, enjoying the charred flavor that accompanies almost every item we prepare. Having said all of that, it's a far cry better than the toaster I did have. To be completely fair, I really do need to delve more into the instruction manual and take my time finding the right settings. I just want a nice slice of toast..."
1,I agree with the bad ratings and am returning my toaster...,"I received this toaster (bought at Target) as a birthday gift on 11/21/06. I was happy with the slim design since I have very limited counter space. I hadn't read any reviews on this until minutes ago, so I wasn't pre-judging.With this toaster, the ruining of my toast and bagels happens in random ways... Sometimes the toaster burns 1/3 of the edge of all of my toast and bagels and leaves the other parts in varied states of toastiness (from nice brown to not toasted.) Sometimes it completely burns up the bagels (when on the same setting as the last scenario.) I've never had a good experience with this toaster. I've tried all different variations because I really wanted this thin toaster to work. I've relented - I'm returning it to Target."
3,Mediocre toaster,"I bought this on the recommendation of America's Test Kitchen and I haven't been very impressed with it. It is possible that it just needs to be broken in a bit, but it goes from not toasting much at all to burnt with a miniscule turn of the knob."
1,Just stopped one day,"We have had it for about a year and a half, and it worked okay. One day, the carriage would not stay down, if you held it down it made this horrible noise. Half of the heating elements seemed to be working when you held it down. We took it apart, found some grease and toast debris on the magnet, which we cleaned off to no avail...still the same thing. Also, we noted one of the wires linking the two sides of elements had broken off at a cinch point. Repairing that wire did allow for all elements to heat but still the carriage problem continues. I hope we can find a toaster that was built to last and not to throw in the landfill."
1,Lasted one year only,Nice features and design. Daily use for a yr and then it shorted out. Purchased 11/17/2010. Quit on 12/21/2011 - 1 month beyond the 1 yr warranty. Very unsatisfactory.
2,"Looks good, toasts lousy","This toaster looks great in brushed stainless steel, has 4 slice capacity, wide opening for bagels, and the sides don't get too hot. The two big problems are the toast level knob is black with a black indicator arrow, so any unintentional adjustment of the toaster is not easily noticed until your toast pops up charred (and the button turns with a very light touch--ie brushing past the toaster). Secondly, we had our toaster less than a year when the center element stopped working, resulting in toast being only toasted on one side...I guess this compensates for the loose dial: one side in now black the other not toasted at all -- result on average it's perfect.Would not buy another Oster toaster."
1,Very Disappointing,"I should have heeded the bad reviews on this waste of time, but was seduced by its good looks and long slots.First, the toaster was the wrong color. The picture clearly shows black plastic, but it arrived with grey plastic. That alone wouldn't have been a deal-breaker.Then, we tried a variety of breads and bagels in it to see how it worked.Verdict - unnacceptable and inedible. Every piece was burnt black on each end and completely untoasted in the middle. This was with the dial set to about 10 o'clock. Any higher setting would produce the only consistent toasting - pitch black over the whole piece!Needless to say, I'm shipping it back in the morning and have ordered the Ciusinart CPT 160."
2,World needs a better toaster than this,"The outside of the outside slot toasts a lot less than the insides. And the ends burn your toast. Otherwise it works, but I wish it would fail so I would have to replace it. Not a good toaster, but it works."
1,Broken Too Soon,After just a few weeks of use I thought blowing a fuse in my kitchen destroyed the electrical system of the toaster. It refused to pop back up and would only so do once you unplugged it. Now I have learned by reading other reviews that they all do this. What a waste of money!!!
1,UNEVEN TOASTING,This is a great looking toaster and we were excited to find it - however I wish I had read all the bad reviews on Amazon before purchasing it - because it's the worst functioning toaster I've ever used. Some areas of the bread get burned while other areas aren't even toasted. It was definitely a miss-step by Oster. We are very disappointed and you will be too if you buy this. Shame on Oster!
2,uneven toasting,"I bought this toaster because I had had a similar Phillips toaster with long slots, and this looked similar, and it was nice in stainless steel to match my other appliances. It is terrible!! you have to rotate once or twice your toasts to get them almost even, it burns the edges and does not toast the middle... DO NOT BUY IT."
1,Incomsistant,We have the worst problem for consistancy. From day to day. From first batch to second. Burnt to underdone. I'm researching a replacement.
2,Almost burned my house down!,"We've been using this toaster for over a year. It toasts ok, nothing special. JUST cleaned out the crumbs thoroughly a week ago. Made toast this a.m., was eating it in the other room when my smoke alarm went off I ran to the kitchen to discover the toaster's filaments burning brightly and smoke coming out of it. There was NO toast in it and the button was not down. It just decided to go on all by itself!! So scary..will never purchase an Oster/Sunbeam product again."
1,Don't waste your money,Appears to look very sophisticated with lots of features. I like to slice long slices from artisan breads for sandwiches and this toaster seemed perfect. This toaster is very inconsistent from slice to slice. Don't turn your back and assume it will work right. First slice may be perfect and the second keep going until you notice the smoke. The bread is expensive enough without watching it go down the disposal. I'm on Amazon looking at reviews to buy something else. I'm not sure it's worth donating to Goodwill!
1,Dead in under 2 months.,1) Didn't toast bagels well. 2) Heard a loud pop and it was dead in under 2 months. 3) Glad it died. 4) Bought Haier long slot to replace - seems to toast better.
2,3rd time wasn't the charm,"My husband and I have been through 3 of these... they've all died within a year or two. As nice as it looks and great as it is at first, I'm not going for #4... as soon as I replace it, it's history."
1,Ryan started the fire,"My husband and I picked out this toaster shortly after we got married. It looked great with all of our stainless steel appliances and we were excited to have the long slots to toast ciabatta bread for sandwiches! The love affair ended about a week after purchase. The toaster was SO inconsistent - setting it on ""2"" some mornings would blacken the bread to the point of being inedible, and other mornings leave it luke-warm. It was beyond frustrating losing bread to the brand-new appliance and filling our kitchen with the distinctive smell of burnt toast. The last time I used it the room was filled with crackling noises and I unplugged it in fear of it setting the house on fire.So disappointed in this product!"
1,Pretty and useless,"This toaster is really pretty. It looks great on the counter. I hate to throw it out. But, it does not toast bread in any kind of acceptable way. The little wires inside that toast the bread don't all work and this means that bread burns on the edges and doesn't toast at all in the center. So, you have black crust and dried out white centers on all your ""toast."" I'd get better results holding the bread up and using a lighter.So sad I spent so much on this thing. Even sadder that I didn't use it right away. By the time I did, I had tossed the receipt (bought this at Target)."
1,"Burnt, Burnt, and Broke","At first, it was ok; but, you had to watch it carefully or the toast would burn. Second of all, if you touched the outside of the toaster it would burn your fingers. The buttons didn't work. Lastly, after six months of light use it stopped working. The toaster would start toasting the item but it wouldn't stop and the cancel button didn't work either creating a fire hazard. When we did an autopsy on the toaster, the inside electrical motherboard was blackened.In summary, based on the other reviews and personal experience, don't buy this toaster."
1,defective product,"After 6-7 months of light use mine broke. Same failure mode as other reviewers: the electronic buttons stopped working. Looks pretty, but a toaster needs to do more than just look pretty on the counter."
3,Not Uniform Toasting,The Oster 6330 Inspire Toaster looks great on the counter. Four slices of toast lets everyone get toast. The long slots handle extra long bread for big sandwiches. The only thing that could be better is uniform toasting.
2,Fine if I only use it once a day,"I replaced a 15 year old, crusty, cheap, old two slice toaster which worked just fine. But for my family of 6, I felt we needed something larger. Well, this one works well enough the first time I use it each morning. After that, it will not work. I have to wait for it to completely cool down and then it might work for me. It's really frustrating and not exactly a time saver. Wish I hadn't gotten rid of the other!"
2,Looks better than it works,"I bought this toaster because of the extra long slots that hold larger slices of bread. I also like the style that matches my stainless kitchen. It's too bad that it doesn't toast evenly and the springs are weak, so the toast doesn't ""pop"" up when done. Also, it can be difficult to heat toaster pastries in this toaster because they fall off the flimsy bread tray between the heating element and the bottom of the toaster. It works, but I've had far better toasters."
2,Poor quality toaster,"Like many others' reviews - this toaster has issues with cooking control. Burns on low settings, and doesn't toast evenly either. Mine lasted slightly over two years, and just ""died"" this morning - the spring no longer keeps food down to cook, and the program buttons stopped working. Every single time I used it, had to watch it to make sure it didn't burn my food. What I liked about it initially were the long slots but it's a very poor quality item. I'd recommend to anyone, pay a little more and get one with better reviews - it's worth the investment."
1,Super touchy adjustment knob,"I burn everything with this toaster. The knob is really touchy, so even a tiny adjustment and I either burn something or it is barely toasted."
5,Excellent toaster,"This our second Oster 6330 toaster. Thhe first one we had stopped ejecting after several years of high use. We use it a lot for toasting bagels and English Muffins - we have o0ne o9r the other (or both) almost every day. It has a button that is useful if the item being toasted is frozen. That will thaw it and then toast it, without burnoing it or drying it out. The fact that we replaced the old one with the exact same model should tell you that we really like this toaster!"
1,Very disappointed,"I, too, have tried every imaginable setting in an attempt to make this toaster work out. Some portion of the bagel is always burnt, while other areas are underdone. I am giving up and buying something else. Don't waste your time and money."
5,It's a good toaster,"I almost didn't buy this toaster because of the bad reviews, but it was really what I wanted so I threw caution to the wind.We've had it about 2 months and it's working just fine.It looks good, takes big, thick slices of European-style bread, and toasts just fine. I don't know what all the fuss was about.I like it. BUT...maybe I'd better wait and see since almost everyone else's experience has turned out to be disasterous. I'll let you know!"
1,DANGER FIRE HAZARD,"If you own this toaster stop using in immediately. It is a serious fire hazard. It WILL fail. It's mode of failure is to lock it's self on like a run away nuclear reactor. You can not shut it off. If you're lucky you'll be able to pull the plug before it bursts into flames. In my kitchen the plug for the toaster is behind it. I had to reach through the flames to pull the plug.Take it back, demand a refund and never buy from Oster or Sunbeam (the parent company) again."
2,Toasts unevenly,"I purchased this toaster initally for the style - great looking. Unfortunately, it doesn't toast evenly - one side is much darker than the other. I contacted Oster who said that they have never received a complaint and that I should exchange it for another one and there shouldn't be a problem. I did that and the same problem exists in this next one. What happened to quality control??"
4,Good group...good music,This Costa Rican group is calling more and more attention on the international scene. An excellent trio delights us with music fusion of great interpretive level and really beautiful compositions born of the heart deeply. Ricardo Ramirez truly exquisite violin. Excellent sound and execution. León Gieco song has accent mistakes in texts...The sound mix of recording is very warm...excellent. Interesting and intense participation of the Latin Jazz Sextet on tracks 4 and 11Very poetic intervention of Ruben Blades (as us has been getting lately). A particular and intimate cd. An example of latino talent to the world!!!
4,Packs A Punch,"Perhaps because of the subject matter (child exploitation), I found this book very painful. The characters were also brilliantly done and that may have added to the impact. I was rooting for the tough female Lt. Julia Brennan from the first page and was snagged instantly by the mysterious loose cannon Peter Foley. Put the two together, which David Cray did, and you've really got something. Put the two together in a chase against someone killing off child porn dealers and cast suspicion against Foley himself, which David Cray also did, and you've got a book impossible to put down.And yet ... and yet ... I did not finish Little Girl Blue. I couldn't. I think the subject matter touched me too much; I didn't want to read any more about it. Near the end, right in the middle of all the wind-up action, I bailed out.Can I recommend this book? Definitely. Just don't tell me the ending. I may go back someday."
4,D Lowe,The Click-It-Club is very simple to use and easy to store when not in use.Those were some of the things I was looking for when I ordered the Click-It-Club beside protecting my car from being stolen.
5,Great Simple Protection Against Truck Theft,I work out of town and my truck sits in my driveway while I am gone. The Click It Club is very easy to install and is a discouragement to potential truck thieves. My wife easily installs and removes the Club when ever she drives my truck. This is a great help takes most of the worry out of having my truck stolen.
5,easy to operate,"About half of the cars parked on my street have a club of some sort. I'm not certain how effective this device is if someone does break in, since I luckily have not experienced that, but I didn't want my car to be the one without a club. In my opinion, the real value of this product is its ability to deter thieves from even trying.To that end, the ease of use was important to me. The Click-It Club unlocks easily to remove and is a cinch to put on the steering wheel and click into place. Even when stopping briefly at a store, I always put on the club, and I'm never tempted to let it go that time.The device also seems to be well-made and looks nice. Like others, I wish that it wasn't possible to pull apart the club completely, that there was a catch at the end, but that's not a deal-breaker."
4,good for printing home photos,very practical for home use. good quality and good price. I like it. The price is good for the quantity of papers you get.
5,Great quality,"This is the only photo paper I will buy. The soft gloss is perfect- it is like a satin sheen so it's not super glossy, but comes out looking extremely professional, like you would get from a studio. Makes the ink saturate nicely and dries quickly. The tab is excellent for grabbing out of the printer too."
1,Good summery. nothing more,"Its a good summery of what the typcial clothing shop is like and gives a lot of general information but doesn't explain how to do those things. Example, the books says a computer system can help me track inventory but doesn't tell me how, what i need, where can i find such a system or what are some good software to do that"
5,This is a good book,I really liked this book.It was very Descriptive & resourceful.It taught me everything i needed to learn about the clothing retail business.If your interested in opening your own clothing business this is the book for you!
1,Woof!,"The first attempt by a new writer and she desperately needs an editor...and a reality check. The author didn't think through many elements of her story and, as a result, the story is very far-fetched: At one point, the heroine pulls a billion dollars in cash out of a safe to buy an oil refinary! In cash! I'm sure every multi-billionaire keeps that kind of cash lying around...right?Nix would have done well to have hired a good editor to help her review the plausibility of the plot...not to mention the grammar.Nix's ideas are interesting, but she needs a mentor and guidance before trying again."
1,You have to read it to believe it....,"This book is insane! It is very, and I mean VERY poorly written. It has errors throughout. I found it quite amusing, but only as an example of ghastly writing. It needs an editor something dreadful!"
5,Fabulous,"This is the second Christmas that I've bought the Bill Gaither DVDs for my parents and grandmother.....they love them, each one adds something new. My grandmother has alzheimers and these dvds help turn her bad days into good ones, thanks Gaithers for all your inspiration and encouragement. My family has sung your songs all my life!!!"
1,Abysmal - terrible buyer's remorse,This has NO power. It won't climb a 5 degree incline. I'm not exaggerating. I have to connect it to a vehicle to jump start it to get enough amps to get the thing to start each time. What a waste of money.
4,Claude Payne Rocks,This Bishop confirmed me in Austin Texas back in 1997. He is a great leader and his vision for the church is excellent.
4,Golden Age of Modest Mouse,This album reinforces the argument that Modest Mouse made better music when they were all drunk and on acid. Their newest stuff is lackluster crap.
2,An Acquired Taste?,"Looking at the reviews already here, I can see that (1)there are too many reviews made by fans with a bias and (2)this album's music is polarizing--the few negative reviews are very negative. I'm with the negative crowd, and perhaps we have a bias too. But if the stuff on here is an acquired taste, I'd say it's a taste not at all worth acquiring. Musically, it's obnoxious (i.e., cacophonous AND uninteresting), and the gratuitous profanity doesn't help. Get The Moon and Antarctica if you have to get a Modest Mouse album. It's actually pretty good."
5,a great driving album,Is there anything better to listen to in your car on the interstate? Probably not.
4,Great place to start a Modest Mouse collection,"Some of Modest Mouse's best are on this CD:2. Heart Cooks Brain8. Trailer Trash9. Out of Gas13. Polar Opposites14. Bankrupt on SellingListen to these 5 songs first. If you don't like these songs, you will not like Modest Mouse. This cd gets 4 out of 5 because simply there is some lackluster content on the CD. With this many tracks what can you expect?"
3,Raw catchiness,"3 1/2Another rightfully praised indie rock classic by the aggressively angular agitators is a lengthy treatise of warbled distort, at times falling prey to its fractured aesthetics but always remaining vibrantly gritty."
5,I used to hate these guys.,"A good friend of mine was really into Modest Mouse awhile back and still is. He played some for me and I was disgusted, the noise, the lack of typical melody, and odd twists and turns, what rubbish, I thought. Many months later, I heard a song of theirs while riding in another friends car and found myself...enjoying it. So I went and bought ""This is a Long Drive..."" and became and instant, lifelong fan. Just recently I acquired enough funds to purchase ""Lonesome Crowded West"" and I must say it is stellar, Isaac Brock is twice the writer and musician Cobain ever was. From the turntable rhythm in ""Heart Cooks Brain"" to the folk rock of ""Styrofoam Boots"", this album and band proves that truly engaging and heartfelt music is still possible in a scene drowned in corporate greed and lifeless stereotypical cliches'."
5,great product!,"It is effective even on cold washes, which is huge ! Now my clothes and sheets don't get ruined with hot water washes that's otherwise needed to kill mites. A small negative - the tea tree oil smell on the clothes."
3,de mite,"Mom got ashma from dust mites because she could no longer vacumn carpet in bedroom. I got this and she rarely needed her inhaler again. I am using myself and always will, just in case. I can't tell any differance but i don't have health problems. Guess it works."
4,Gem for application Development,This book is an excellant source of information for building application from off the shelf business objects. It describes in detail process of building application and its shortcomings with ability to build application yourself. Also it discusses and details process of building application from off the shelf Business Objects. It is written in very user friendly language and plenty of illustrations.
5,Adictive,"I'm a bit puzzled by the negative reviews in regard to this album. Frankly I find it the best CD (besides Afterlife Siplicity Y2K) that Head Khandi has put out and frankly I can't stop listening to it.The CD is a bit different from the first Beach House and it's sound is much more similar to that of the Deeper#1 CD. The songs are deep, danceable and reflective. When I listen to ""Do it Now"" by Dubtribe Sound System, I want to cry. I especially love the song ""Lovely"" by Soulstice it is one of the most realistic love songs I have ever heard. In short this is a great CD and one of HK best productions. Practically every song is good. I would recomend it to those of you who liked the first Deeper CD and the Served Chilled CD's."
3,Don't expect too much from this one.,"It doesn't have the same big impact as the first one. One year past now, same kind of music has no refreshing feeling anymore. I actually expected too much from this album: new sound, new grove, new names. Well, not much in it. Too much jazz and flat yet boring house rhythm. Sounds good when you play it as background music and not really get into it."
5,Is the new House of XXI Century,"I have listened the BEACH HOUSE 1 and 2 and i can to say that there are the most beatiful Compilations of the world. It's a relax music , with JAzz, latin and Brazilians sounds. It's perfecto for a meeting with your friends or on the beach."
1,This is NOT a lot of 6 cages,"I am EXTREMELY disappointed. The title of this product reads ""YML Small Breeding Cages, Lot of 6, Black. HOWEVER....this is only for ONE cage. Despite ""their"" error, they did not offer to honor their ad and send me the ""other"" 5 cages I was supposed to get, per THEIR ad. Now I am stuck with just ONE cage and I would've NEVER spent $38.00 for just one cage. Buyer beware!!"
3,Kind of Technical,"As a fan of Michael Crichton, Stephen King, and the works, I was hoping the book would incorporate more action than I expected. There were many occassions where the technical terms were difficult to understand, but thankfully the notes at the bottom of the pages helped. The only part where I think was most interesting and exciting was when the crew discovered the Submarine and ventured into it to look for the secrets that it held. The rest is kind of, well, boring. And it was difficult, trying to make a deep sea expedition sound interesting. I mean, looking for core samples in the Hellencian Trench is not exactly the kind of thing you hear everyday. But overall, I'd enjoy Mr. Ballard's Non-Fiction works better. By the way, Lieutanent Haddix sounded more like Superwoman to me than a regular 1800."
5,great book,"I loved this book! Unlike the other reviews, I didn't think the terminology was overly technical, but then again I work in the engineering field. The writing has a good flow to it, is very suspenseful and captivating. I had a difficult time putting it down."
1,"No Product, No Review","I'm sorry to say I still have not received the product. Visited the post office and spoke to the supervisor, Kevin Fox yesterday, August 27th, 2012. He's looking in other stations to see if it can be found. How are incidences like this one usually resolved? I still want the product. What do you suggest I do?Hazel Monk-Montgomery"
5,The absolute best,"I bought this being VERY skeptical. I have the shortest, brittle, crappy, thin nails ever. I didnt want to ruin them further with acrylics either, so I bought a small bottle of this........holy crap let me tell you. My nails have never been so strong long or healthy. I love painting them now, and Im not ashamed to point at things,fearing people will see my chewed up nasty nails. LOVE THIS STUFF. Definately will never use another product on my nails, now if I can only find my miracle hair product........................"
5,Wow!,I have used jut about every nail strengthening product known to man and this is the only one that has ever made a difference for me. Before my nails used to break after getting a certain length and now I have to cut them before they get too long! My nails are still thin but nailtiques has made them stronger! I noticed a difference in a week!
5,GREAT!,Darn! This was a good book.I bought this bbok not because it looked good but because the day after I bought it a huricane was coming and I was going to be without electricity for a while.Thank God I bought it this is the best book I have read in a long time.The action is fast paced and naration is excelent.I heard that Bruce Willis bought the rights to the book.I hope he makes the movie because if someone can do solomon is him.I think Huggins wrote this with a screenplay in mind. Great action.
2,I'm being generous with the stars......,If you are a teenage boy or a thirty year old burnout living in your parents basement then this book is for you. Otherwise I suggest reading the Exorcist for horror or watching Buffy and Angel for good drama and the laughs. This book plain *****.
1,I wish I could give it no stars,"I can't believe that garbage like this is produced by a major publishing house. With thousands of new writers with far better ideas trying to break into the industry, the fact that Huggins is taking up valued space is an unpardonable sin. This guy has about as much creativity and originality as a pie in the face. Which is what the reader feels is happening as they waste time on such claptrap. IQ points literally fall away with each turn of the page. Huggins uses some of the same phrases and descriptions repeatedly which shows the kind of keen eye he turned towards his work. I was not surprised to learn that Huggins is now one of ""Hollywood's most sought-after screenwriters."" If lame plots, hilariously bad dialogue, one-dimensional characters, and generally uninspired tales are valued in Hollywood, then Huggins will have a long career ahead of him. After all, he's displayed these same traits expertly in this trash."
4,Couldn't stop reading!!!,"This book is like an action movie with a brain. Utterly engrossing. It has more action than I've ever read, a lot of mystery to keep you reading, and typical but amusing soldier talk. Its written like a good movie script, but a bit over descriptive. The character's are the usual type. A burnt-out, take cahrge soldier boy, intellectual preist, beautiful scientist. The dialouge is also typical, but thats not why you want to keep reading. You want to know why Cain does what he does and how they can defeat him and the outcome. I love the story line and made me want to find out as much as I can about this type of thing. A few character and dialouge flaws aside, a definite reccomendation."
2,Far too many genre's in just one book,"James Byron Huggins tries to combine every genre you can imagine in this book. There is science fiction, action, adventure, mystery, devil worship, romance, and conspiracy theories. The book plays out as more of an action movie or video game. The only character with any real depth is soloman. I felt the book had an interesting plot, but never amounted to much. The ending turned out better than i had anticipated and saved it from only getting one star."
3,"The action scenes are great, but the writing needs work.","Huggins' habit of constantly throwing out unusual adjectives (galactic, volcanic, etc.) is jarring and awkward. It is quite noticeable and tends to take you 'out' of the story. Fortunately, Huggins has crafted a very enjoyable action thriller that overcomes any shortcomings in his writing style by delivering some of the best action scenes ever put to paper. Clever, suspenseful, exhilirating, brilliant - See, now he has me throwing out adjectives like there's no tomorrow! Overall, while Huggins' writing lacks the polish of a Michael Crichton, he still knows how to tell a rip-roaring yarn. Recommended."
2,Cain would have been better off in hell,"Wow. I can't make myself finish it. Poor dialogue, tired plotline, and boring characters, except for the nun, Sister Mary Francis. I liked her a lot.It seemed every chapter ended with a tired one-liner, such as ""I'm gonna see if I can make a dead man die,"" or ""I'm gonna hunt this thing like an animal, and I'm gonna take it down like an animal,"" etc., etc. Tell me Mr. Higgins, did you by any chance help Lucas write the last three Star Wars pre-quels?The idea for the story is wonderful. Man plays God, and sets forth something inhuman on the world. But the story had no drive. I got bored easily.I wouldn't really recommend this one."
3,A Great B Movie,"This book is a fast read and would be a great script for B Sci Fi movie. I picked up this book because of the alluded religious/Sci Fi thriller. This is an action book, and not a mystery thriller. Basically you have evil being that possesses the scientifically enhanced body of a dead former CIA operative who was at his peak form at death, set free upon the world. And the hero, who is set upon stopping him with the help of the Catholic Church.Some of the book is written well. The action is non-stop. And the storyline is very easy to follow. The book has a good basis. The bad thing is that the author has not seemed to do his research. Not on the medical advancements he tries to use for the enhancement of the body. Nor in the geographic locations he inaccurately describes. But it is a fun read non-the less. Pick it up if you have a 2-hour flight. It will pass the time quickly."
2,YAWN,"Cain = an indestructable techno-vampire Solomon=a carbon-copy character that could fit into any formulaic 80's action film. Speaking of formulaic, that's the best way to describe the plot. Good idea for a book, and the character of Cain was cool, but the rest of this book is garbage."
5,"This is an all action ""romp"". I have read it 3 times.","It is about Cain a super soldier possesed by Satan. If that wasn't bad enough he has been built to be impervious to all modern weapons and must drink human blood to stay alive. Soloman is an ex-soldier who is persuaded to come back to kill Cain. Marcelle, an Exorcist, helps Sol in his battle against Cain. It reads like an action film, right down to bonding between Sol and the scientist who created Cain's daughter. But don't let this put you off, it is an extremly good book which also contains some very interesting detail about exorcisim. READ THIS BOOK!! (I would have given it 10 stars but they would'nt let me.)"
4,Evil At Its Evilest,I have read this book twice and it was just as good the second time through. It had the vilest character I have read ever and very well done. The writing style is excellent. I recommend this book if you like suspense and action because this is a griping page turner.
3,"Could have been much, much better","Cain is an engineered superhuman, created from a dead body of a speacial forces maniac who becomes possessed by Satan. He escapes from the experimental lab and goes on a relentless, bloody rampage. He must be stopped before he brings the world to total destruction, which is the plan of Satan. Excellent on action but too long on chapters with repeating narratives about several meanings of life - which after awhile simply becomes boring. Could have been much shorter and thus much better."
2,Shoot Him Already,"Here comes the formula...the old warrior punishing himself because he lost his wife and little daughter, the self-questioning Jesuit priest, the good looking scientist babe and her little daughter. See where this is going yet? Cain, supercharged and dyno-tuned, is the six million dollar man with a silly religious twist. Cain can rip through steel, run like a cheetah and throw dice with the best of them. Of course the protagonist (name of Solomon no less) is much tougher. He fights with Cain with regularity and never really gets hurt. The Jesuit priest must have seen ""The Exorcist"" one time too many as he wields his silver crucifix and slips into the thees and thous of King James English. I won't even go into the Mother Superior nervously fingering her rosary beads. If you wasted time with this tripe; perhaps you wondered (as I did),why the government just didn't call in a sniper with a tranquilizer gun..... I know this book put me to sleep!"
1,"Cussing,what a let down!","I loved ""The Reckoning"" ALOT and people I loaned the book loved it too. But I picked up Cain, Theres way too much cussing for a religious themed writer. I loaned The Reckoning to a friend and she loved it also,she picked up Cain at the library and said the same thing, What a downfall from a great book to that!!!!"
2,Comic-book style light fluff,"This tale is good for a weekends read if there's nothing more engaging lying around. The sci-fi elements are not very well thought out, the horror elements are not very scary but the action sequences are ok. Just don't take them too seriously. This is ""GooseBumps"" for adults, nothing more."
2,Nice Woodcuts decorate Pretentious Ghost Stories,"The 'patron saint' of the ""Morgan Library Ghost Stories"" is supposedly M.R. James. If true, then he must be rolling over in his grave. One of his cardinal precepts on writing ghost stories was to beware of talkative ghosts (they aren't scary). The ghosts in this book could enter the Miss America contest and get elected 'Miss Conviviality'. In other words, the Morgan Library ghosts are chatty losers.I imagine ""Morgan Library Ghost Stories"" might be a collectors' item some day since it is published in a limited edition with nice wood engravings by John De Pol. However, those of you who enjoy a well-written, truly frightening ghost story should give this book a pass."
5,"Riveting, Inspiring, Funny",I also could not put this book down. I began it on a plane flight and was almost hoping for a delay in the air so that I could keep reading it. I read it in about 3 days. The way Gary Karton weaves the incredible story of Rodney Caroll from present to past and back to present creates a fasinating tale. Mr Caroll's life and work is definitely worth anyone's time to read - from the most liberal of social workers to the most conservative corporate board member. I kept thinking that I want to meet the man himself! It's a fabulous piece of work and I highly recommend it.
4,A good help book for work and life.,"Yes this book left me with the feeling I had heard words of wisdom from an experienced father and businessman. The book is unique in that it offers methods for dealing with both Work and life. The author is gifted in his use of examples and is very organized in his construction. I only removed one star because there is little research beyond his life's experiences. I expect facts or more statistical examples, when I read a book.Still all in all this is a book filled with wise words. If heeded, I sure it will improve your life as it has mine."
1,Boring!!,"I'm still trying to finish this book, it is so boring. The characters Carly and Evan are annoying Evan treats Carly like dirt is moody and talks down to her and she in turn gets angry sometimes and tells him off or she just gets timid and says nothing. When Evan does have something nice to say to her she is so happy and thrilled he's being nice to her. This Carly character needs to get a backbone and Evan with his mood swings and dark behavior are in no way sexy or interesting, I have picked this book up 3 times to try to read it and I'm barely half way done with it I know I will never buy another book from this author."
2,It's all about the shoes!!!,"Have you ever had something that you thought was lucky? In the book, My Red Shoes, Carly looses her lucky shoes one evening when she gets drunk and passes out at a party. Now she is searching vigorously to find the shoes that brought her so much success. She soon finds out that love is on the way. The questions are- ""Does she get her shoes back from her arch enemy?, Who is her arch enemy?, and why do they want the shoe?""This story is realistic fiction, which is a love story. In my opinion it was not the most interesting book because the story dragged, and I do not care for love stories. I do not care for love stories because they seem meaningless. I would suggest this book to an older and more mature person. The reason I would suggest it to an older person is because it is inappropriate for someone younger."
5,Not For Beginners,"This is not another book that tells you how to develop character or how to move a character from one room to another.It doesn't outline seventeen pitfalls of grammar or the 23 basic plots.If you still think you ought to find synonyms for ""said"", you ain't ready for this one yet.This book is for would-be writers who have talent and have worked hard to develop it. It tells you what to do next if you want to write... particularly, if you want to write fiction.Particularly, if you want to write popular fiction.If what you want to write is literary fiction, then this book won't help you and, heavens to Betsy, who can blame it?"
4,Realities of Nutrition,This book is written such that it can be used as a text book but is also an easy read. Great organization and a superb index make it a wonderful bookshelf reference. This is NOT a diet book. It doesn't tell you what to eat but rather presents the facts about food and human physiology so that you can make your own informed decisions.
4,How to Read Literature like a Professor,This book does what its title implies. I like the way you learn to look at literature and look for patterns - all aimed at gaining understanding. Enjoy an easy read on a fascinating topic. Memorable.
4,Not bad. Not bad at all.,"Having to read an assigned book is almost never pleasurable, however I'd make an exception for this one. The author managed to be witty and sarcastic while remaining informative."
3,practical guide to reading,"Foster tackles Literature from a symbolic metaphorical side, delving into Myths, symbols, and the connectedness of all Literature etc.In a lively and entertaining manner he shows the reader how to draw parallels between texts and explores poetic metaphors effectively.The weakness of the book is that the author doesn't really delve deeply enough into other important aspects such as Character development, Plot devices, structure of the novel among other things. He's thematic discussions, too, are at times somewhat shallow,Nonetheless, it is a worthwhile book that certainly deserves to read."
2,I learned nothing useful,"I was assigned to read this book by my AP Lang. teacher as summer reading. I don't wish to advertise falsely; I am in high school not college, but my class is ""college-level"" and if I pass the AP exam, I will get college credits, so I feel as if I can review this book properly. I cannot truthfully say I can ""read literature like a professor"" after reading this book, in fact I learned very little. My teacher has asked the class if they thought it a good idea for her to use the same reading assignment for her students next year and no one in my class thought it would be a successful venture. Also if you're a teacher thinking similarly to mine that this would be a good summer reading project, there were answers to her essay questions all over the internet. If you do create an assignment implementing this book, you should come up with your own, original questions. This book is very dry and I loathe it."
3,How one professor looks at literature,"This book is full of great examples of how to interpret literature. Unfortunately, it falls short on imagination and coveniently slots themes, plots and characters into several well contrived but narrow definitions. It is a good read for those studying literature but does not hold the answers that it seems to promise from the title."
2,arrrggg,My daughter abolutely hated this book. She was required to read this over the summer before her Junior year and literally had to force herself to read it.
2,Eh,"I had to read this for AP English IV this summer. I like to read, so I don't judge books just because they're for school. However, if they are terrible, than they are terrible and it doesn't matter why I am reading them. I didn't like this book. Most of my class felt like he was very repetitive and didn't say much of anything that you shouldn't already know if you're in AP English. But that was just our take on it."
2,so so,book was a little bit interesting but after a while it became very repetitive and too opiniated. lost some of his points most of the time-maybe because they were the same points over and over again
5,Helpful read,It is just what I needed to help me in my pursuit to further my education. Would recommend to everyone who loves to read but wants a little more insight.
5,Required Reading,This should be the first book every high school freshman should read. Would really make getting into literature interpretation easier.Great work. Thank you.
3,A gentle playful invitation.,"This is a pretty decent introduction to literature. As he states in the book, it's watered down Northrop Frye, which he recommends you read.Anatomy of Criticism: Four Essays. It's a primer, not a real study, and I think his flip tone is an attempt to ease non-readers into the mix. This is not a book for people who are already reading or have taken any of the basic lit classes. THIS IS NOT A CRITICISM. I believe this is the book he intended to write, and I think he did a decent job.My only complaint after reading it once is his troubling mistake when recommendingHow to Read a Poem: And Fall in Love with Poetry. He says it is by Robert Pinsky, former poet laureate. It isn't. It's by Edward Hirsch.A minor thing, but I'm shocked it wasn't corrected for the later editions.I recommend:The Pleasures of Reading in an Ideological AgeReading Like a Writer: A Guide for People Who Love Books and for Those Who Want to Write Them (P.S.)"
4,Overall a good book for introduction to literature,"I like this book. Written in a humorous, informative and engaging manner, it is clearly intended for layperson. Literature need no other elementary book than this! But beware, some parts of the book are quite boring and long-winded. Maybe you can skip that parts and re-read those interesting portions instead. This introduction is mainly for western literature where most if not all of the author's reasonings are right-on. Literature from other cultures (e.g. Chinese/Japanese/Korean/Indian) are based on different premises."
5,Great product!!!,The shipping was fast and the book arrived in a great condition. Ibought this book for my AP Englidh Literarure Class and it' is very helpful. It's easy to understand once you get a hang of it.
2,Not a winner.,"This book gave me some good tips on what to look for when I read literature, but while reading a book, I can't make the connections. The author gives a lot of examples from other novels, but the things he covered in the book, haven't helped me, yet, in my reading endevours."
3,Buy the cheaper paperback,"The book was ok, another one of the endless facilitatory reads we Americans need because we are too lazy (which we call, ""too busy"", i.e. too busy watching TV) to actually spend real time learning.But what gets me is that Amazon charges more for the Kindle version than they do for the paperback. Absurd. It costs probably as close to 0 extra dollars as possible in this day for Amazon to make the Kindle format version, delivery via ""whispernet"", in other words, ""Internet"", costs as little as it does for each on line order probably, and there are 0 output charges, storage, delivery, materials to make the books. Be real Amazon, you were the only reader out there, now you are not and if your prices don't go down you are colluding with the other manufacturers to rip off the reading public."
2,"Interesting subject, but not very well written.","I expected to love this book. I certainly like the subject matter and was looking for a fun refresher after years away from school. But try as I might, the book just bored me. Foster is no where near as funny as he think he is or wants to be. He seems a genial enough writer, and I think he truly wants readers to understand literature, but the writing of this book is just so boring. I am sorry to say I can't recommend it. My suggestion would be to keep looking."
3,A book only for the American audience?,"The book is quite entertaining. It fills a gap and handles some really good points regarding the symbolism of the texts and the sub-meaning of the lines, so every literature-reader must take a look at it sometime, so that they can learn to look at the texts in a deeper way.However, the book seems to be written for an American audience, which prevents the book from being universal.Anyway I would recommend it to everybody, I believe anyone can gain knowledge from this book."
4,"If it was a snake, it would have bit you","Lively enough to entertain and chock full of the kind of information that should be obvious, but isn't. This book really affirms the belief that a well rounded education is a benefit for a lifetime. I had no idea that literature was full of so many references to mythology, the bible, and other literature just to name a few examples."
3,How to Read Literature Like a Professor: A Lively and Entertaining Guide to Reading Between the Lines,This book was listed as very good and my teacher that received the book said it was a mess. I don't feel the explanation of the condition of the book was accurate.
4,"What can I say, it was a required book.","The book purchased was on the summer required reading list. Although it was delivered in a timely fashion and in perfect condition, my child totally dislikes the content. She is a reader, and thought the first chapter was good. However, things went downhill from there. She is not finding it an easy read, not by a long shot."
2,Boring and Disjointed,This book was poorly written and hard to follow.I wish the professor had written a clear outline of his thoughts.It did not help me read like a professor. I am already a better reader because of my Kindle.
4,Excited about this product,"I have yet to actually read this book, but as a Junior in college studying to become an English teacher, this book seems to be an excellent resource for my education. Classes are can be incredibly difficult, but this text (in the introduction alone) has proven to be a great source of clarity. I would advise this book to anyone who wants to become a better student of literature as well as a better communicator of complex subjects in literature and language arts."
3,How to Read Literature,"Took a while to arrive, but was in good condition. However, did not find it useful for my use."
5,Good Book for Students,"I wish that I'd read this book before I began college too many years ago. How to Read Literature Like a Professor summarizes in accessible style and tone many of the points that it took years to learn on my own. It would be a good gift for any junior or senior in high school who's headed for college. It will ease the transition from reading at the literal level, to learn what happens in the plot, to reading at deeper levels, to learn what the author is saying ""between the lines."" Inclusion of references to film, television, theatre, and music strengthens How to Read Literature Like a Professor by refering to genres with which students may be more familiar. (The current universal reference for high school students is the film trilogy of The Lord of the Rings.) The literary references form a wonderful reading list. The humor helps to demonstrate that approaching literature does not have to be a solemn occasion."
2,"Alright, young minds...","The book falls flat. Written with the air of a would-be Robbin Williams-style professor, it is on the whole condescending and patronizing, and too cute by half. He beats basic concepts into the ground and arrives at some rather questionable conclusions. Literary Theory, A Very Short Introduction, from Oxford University Press, does a much better job of introducing the subject with much less text."
5,Works with 2001 Santa Fe,"The kit had the ring, side brackets, and spacers for use with multiple cars. The instructions say to use the wider set of spacers under the brackets to space the head unit away from the center pod of the dash but, in my case with my JVC head unit, that was too much offset. I installed with no spacers and everything fit perfectly."
2,Could Be Better,The box it was in was open and the tip of the eyeliner was broken. Not impressed with the packaging.
5,Light and Pleasant Taste,"I have been using Motor Tabs for over a year. I have tried many powdered products that you just add water to and Motor Tabs works best for me. Most drinks leave a nasty after taste. Motor Tabs (fruit punch) is like drinking a slighty sweetened Kool-Aid. I wanted something as close to water tasting as possible with the extra nutrients. My mouth doesn't feel gummy after drinking it. It doesn't have protein so it's not for an endurance training, however, I just add Perpetuem if I'm going long. It also doesn't have that fake sugar taste. Not sure what the other reviewer was doing to get it in his water bottle but all you have to do is snap it in half and it will fit. They are kind of the consistency of a SweetTart. Most of the time they are already busted in the package and you carefully pour it in. The dissolve time seems fine for me too. Don't shake your bottle until it is completely dissolved. It fizzes."
5,Ideal on-the-go drink!,"I've tried all the fizzy electrolyte tablets, and these are far-and-away my favorite. They have a light, refreshing taste with no salty overtones. I'm training for a marathon and I use them on all my runs over 8 miles. They provide only a slight bit of carbs (65 calories per tab), so it doesn't weigh me down or ""fight"" with the gels I ingest."
5,Classic Caiden!!!,"Another fascinating tale from an American master storyteller... one of my favorite all time writers (second to only John D MacDonald).My second favorite from Martin Caiden, a gripping tale of the Florida drug smuggling trade, from a military vet pilot who gets dragged into it, the mysterious girl he is fated to hook up with, her weird and sometimes scary circle of 'friends, the insane double agent that wants to see him burn, and the master smuggler he has to 'take down' to get his own life back from the feds... another story that would make a Great Movie!!!"
2,I must have accidentally ordered a brochure...,"...because this hardly qualifies as a real book.If you're looking for the meat in product management/product launches in the high-tech world, this is not the place. This book is only 200 pages and has HUGE type. Quantity obviously does not correlate with quality, but there is nothing in here beyond the most basic marketing ""tips"" to launching a new product. There is no mention of the differences between hardware vs. software product launches and no case studies or real-world examples at all. As a newly minted MBA and a current marketing manager for a software company, I didn't find anything new here. It's marketing 101....the book most certainly does not belong on the desk of EVERY product manager. If you are technical person who has little to no experience in marketing, you may find this useful as a STARTER to understanding the marketing side of the equation, but don't expect any detailed, how-to advice."
3,Elementary Watson,"Book is based more on what the old high tech business model was, I got money and I got to spend it. Lacks insight into creating a product launch that is more than a one off event. The lack of understanding why people buy and the value delivered is a major weakness. Strengths of the book is that style is the key focus and not substance, so if lipstick and blush are critical to your product launch this is the book for you."
3,Worth a read,"If someone is going to take up a Product Manager's role for the first time, this book is very handy to understand the key factors which needs to be addressed in a product launch plan. Catherine has described it in a very simple manner and step-by-step approach. The book doesnt give a readymade solution which you can use verbatim but provides primitives which will definitely be of great help. Last but not the least, as a product manager you will be able to produce output as soon as you get on to the job."
3,"VRFM8W,.....does work,.....within reason.","I bought the VRFM8W about a week ago and tested it out in 2 cars. The first test was in my Saturn with a Sony CDXGT300 player in the Clearwater, Florida area. I had significant interference on all the 14 stations in trying to tune in the transmitter (clicking mostly),...however I did get one that after 20 minutes of listening did not bother me as much and was acceptable for a ""FM"" station listen. If you are audio book listening,....it seems to be a bit more easier to deal with the lower fidelity than listening to a favorite song of course. Anyway next I tested it on a standard car am/fm radio in a toyota,....and it worked alot better. I did not have the clicking on the lower settings and was easy to listen to. It seems that my ""nicer"" radio with the electronics to pull in more stations works to well and causes more interference than the cheaper basic car radio when using the VRFM8W."
1,Save your money,"I agree with NomDePlume. I had high hopes for this product as well. Even if it worked, sort of, I would have been happy but it didn't even do that. USB connection sucked, and the sound quality using the cord was awful. Customer service was even worse. Simply wasn't worth the money, and it wasn't even all that expensive. I'll just burn a disc while I'm returning mine for a refund."
1,Not reliable,I had this item for one week and it broke. Replaced the fuse and it still wouldn't work. I'm waiting on a replacement from the manufacturer.
2,Very Low Fidelity!,"I was expecting more from this product. I used it for 2 weeks, It does not lose signal, works perfectly with my Manufacturer installed radio in my Corolla 2005 at New Jersey Area, But the sound fidelity is terrible, sounds more like AM(amplitude modulation) not even FM. I would recommend this product only if you don't care about the lower fidelity. Also, the USB takes an eternity to play the next song, At the beginning, I thought the device was broken until realized that's how it works."
3,"OK, but beware what they don't tell you","Pros:-Fill a niche that no other product does.Cons:-Sound quality is radio-only, not CD or mp3.-Limited to 2GB file capacity (even though the manual sez unlimited!)-Sensitive - have to unplug it when starting the car.-Rude and surly tech support.Summary - When someone else comes up with a replacement, this thing's going in the garbage."
3,FM Modulator,"The first unit that was sent was broken, so I had to pay post office $5.00 to ship and to get it exchanges, they wouldn't let me swing by and exchange it. The second one works, but the remote doesn't, so why should I spend another $5.00 to exchange it, and end up paying $10.00 more for an item that originally cost around $17.99, this is not right, so I will not buy anything else from this company. What other option is there? return it? spend more money and end up wasting the total cost on shipping back and forth and not have anything, just throwing away money."
2,Cheap unit for a cheap price,"Unit does everything described in the Product Description but they don't tell you that you have to crank up the radio volume way up to hear anything, the sound quality is only fair, or that the unit is flimsy. It does play MP3 files but I was under whelmed by the overall quality."
3,MP3 Player,"For the money this is a fair deal. The weakness of the product is the limited number of stations that this unit is capable of utilizing. Other than that it serves it purpose. I use it to download mp3 audio programs and then play them while driving. Not the best audio quality but this was not purchased for music. I would buy another one if the need should arise. It is a very reliable product and uses a USB Flashdrive for storage making it very simple to use. But you should know that you cannot fast-forward what you are listening to, you can only go the next audio file."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,You can never get the product to keep a station on the radio long enough to allow your music to play. It is always fading in and out or lots of static. It was a waste of money. We don't ust it at all.
1,"Limited number of fm frequencies, compared to other variants of same product","This was my third fm modulator from VR3. The other two work fine. This one is a big disappointment. It has a more limited number of fm frequencies available and none of those coincides with a ""clear"" on in my geographic area. So essentially unusable."
1,not good,"it worked for the first day..would play one song and then try the second one and then start over and over, but only for a few seconds..JUNK"
4,Great beanie..,"i live in the south but it does get pretty cold in the winter. This thing is made from 100 % wool which I love and the little ear band inside the cap is polyester. IMO the price is a little high. The reason for 4 stars is cause I live in the south and it never gets below 30 deg., but I wore this thing while I was jogging at night, and a little wind picked up, I felt like the wind blew thru my brain,.. It doesnt block the wind from getting to your skull IMO better than any other cheap beanie I have bought from the dollar store.Also like other have said, it is slightly tight, so if you are a fat construction worker you gonna need something bigger. The biggest props I can give for this is that its 100% wool and it looks cool as hell, you can wear it with different jackets and it matches them perfectly..."
3,IF you know MS Excel or MS Access dont Waste $$$,This is worse than the Dummies Book.....This book almost assumes you do not know ANYTHING about Reports.The book is good for a new REPORT Writer....but if you have ever grouped or written your own formulae....it is a waste of your time. if you are new to the concept of Report writing it is acceptable.Not for a new
2,"Great sound, poor construction","The sound is great, especially for the price point (got these for under $50), but that quality suffers. The plastic holding the ear pieces on is quite cheap, and now, just a little over 1 year of usage (delicate usage) - both sides have cracked.Time to get out the superglue and see if I can salvage it..."
2,Don't hold up,"Pros: Nice sounding, comfortable, long battery life.Con: Breaks too easily with ordinary use. The plastic retainer that limits size adjustment broke off (very cheaply made) and now the earphone comes of the steel headband. Should NOT have happened.Look elsewhere."
3,"Good sound, bad durability","Bought these at one of the day deal sites about 2 years ago and was happy with sound quality and noise cancelling. Then about a year into it, they started to break. At first it was small cracks in the plastic where the headband expands on both right and left which was annoying as the headband would sometimes dislocate but still working, and then the right side broke off altogether at the fork right before the speaker rendering them unusable. The plastic is of very poor quality, other than that they performed fine. Now looking for a replacement."
2,Good while it lasts,"It survived 5 to 6 trips, then suddenly I cannot hear any human voice coming from the headset anymore. No more dialogue from the movies."
3,Good and Bad,I must concur with those who report the electronics are excellent but the durability is sorely lacking. They didn't last a year. The casing above the swivel broke and the earpad fabric came loose and the foam decompressed. I bought the Bose QC 15's.
5,Great Headset with an MP3!!,"I received this item for Christmas. Prior to that I had never even considered purchasing an item similar to this. I use these primarily with my Sansa MP3 player and all I can say is WOW!! It really works, flip the switch on the side and instantly the background noise is eliminated, almost entirely. You can still hear when someone is talking to you but the background ""hiss"" disappears. Using an MP3 with this seems to amplify the sound of the music while muting out the background noise. With traditional MP3 ear buds you can still hear some background noise, but with these all you hear is the music. I can actually hear notes in certain songs that I never knew where there before, AMAZING!!If you are looking for a comfortable, well-built headset, with a nice carrying case and phono adapters for multiple hookups then I would recommend these to anyone."
5,Poor Man BOSE,"I am listening to these right now, at home and there is no hiss sound as I read from another reviewer. The sound quality on this is comparable to the NC BOSE, which I tried but couldn't bring myself to buy them for their ridiculous asking price. Take into consideration that the source of the sound, the mp3, stereo, etc.. has a lot to do with the quality of the sound you will get from these or any headphone. I am going on a long trip in a few days and will come back to write about the noise canceling in the plane. I was lucky and was able to get these for less than sixty bucks at woot.com, as a matter of fact, I got 3, one for my girlfriend, one for me and the last, might get sold or given away to a lucky nephew."
3,worked fine till they broke,"they worked quite well, very good for the price (I bought them on woot! for [...] bucks) for about 6 months, then when I did a very simple twist(they are hinged so the ear cups will turn 90 degrees to lay flat)- the casing broke, and they are now useless. Sad really, sounded good but undermined by cheap construction, like so many of Jabra's products"
2,Did not work well for sleeping,"I bought these since I like to listen to music in bed. Whenever there was any pressure directly on the phones from the pillow, there was a loud high pitched interference sound. The noise cancelling was just average"
3,"excellent sound and comfort, terrible durability","Prior to those I owned Sennheiser PXC 250 and also tried Audio Technica ATH-AC7. I found the sound and comfort of the Jabra C820s to be far superior. Battery life is terrific too, on one AAA battery. Unfortunately, the first cracks appeared around the second month. About 6 months later, large chunks of plastic are missing. I cannot take them on a plane anymore, and soon they will not be usable at home either. But they are so good otherwise that I am considering buying them again and treating them with extra care."
1,CAUTION WITH JABRA C820S HEADPHONES,"Jabra C820S Active Noise Cancelling Stereo HeadphonesThis product worked for about 3 days then the left ear cup quit working with the active noise cancellation switch on. I sent the item to the distributor in Canada for a replacement. So far, the new Jabra C820 noise cancellation headphones work alright. I would not recommend this item for serious isolation from external noise to get better stereo sound. They do not block out external high frequency noise. These Jabra headphones would work on a smaller low wattage stereo or television, but they have low capability for handling much volume without distortion. They do come in a very nice black zipper case with storage pocket, and adapter plugs. The headphones are very lightweight for wearing over the ears."
1,Cheap Materials. Will not buy Jabra product again,"I purchased these headphones based on the reviews. I do a lot of traveling, and am also a mobile DJ. Sound is very important to me...and the noise cancelling on the plane...first when I got them, I thought that these look pretty good and the sound quality is pretty decent considering the price...but the construction quality is where these headphones lack. The plastic portion that attaches the ear cups to the headband is starting to crack on both sides with very light use. I contacted JABRA and their customer service department is one of the worst. I sent them a receipt to show that the item has been purchased two months ago, and is still under their one year warranty...they told me that they will not cover the product, since this item has not been sold from an authorized re-seller since 2006. I will never purchase another JABRA product again. If you want something to last more than two months, then look elsewhere. DO NOT BUY JABRA!!!"
2,"I bought these based on the reviews I read, but....","I bought these headphones based on the reviews I read. I was leaning toward the bose NC3, but thought I would try Jabra since so many people were comparing them to the bose and didn't find much difference, and the fact that they make very nice bluetooth devices. Well, I can tell you that there is a vast difference from the moment you put them on. For starters the Jabra are noise cancelling, but they're not good in quiet areas because if you want to turn up the volumn then others around you can hear it as well. With the bose you can crank up the sound as loud as you want. Also, the sound of the bose is without a doubt a more crisp sound. you feel like you're shut off from the world when you have them on. With the Jabra, it's not the same. They're good headphones for the price, but I definitely wouldn't compare them to the bose. They're worth what I paid for them."
3,"Great sound, plastic casing breaks","Used these for a while now. Sounds is great. Unfortunately, the plastic breaks, particularly on either side at the top where the head size adjustments are made. More recently its also breaking just above one of the ears. I keep applying superglue to try to keep it in tact but I fear its only going to help for a short while."
3,"good sound, poorly made","These sound very good, but no matter how careful you are, be prepared to see your headphones' plastic parts chip, ... until they break to unusability.I didnt want to give up on them and taped them, first it was that thing that adjusts the size of the band, then the plastic part that rotates, then the plastic thing that is attached to the earpieces... both of them. Now the right earpiece came off.Taping them wont do anymore. :-("
2,Made with Cheap Plastic,"I've had my headphones for about 18 months. I use mine daily, and put them back in the case when I'm not using them. While I've had no problems with the sound quality, the plastic on the headbands has shattered and I can no longer use them. Cheap plastic provides no durability."
4,Noise Cancelling at an affordable price,"For those that work in an environment where you want some peace-and-quiet these are the headphones for you! They are super-light and easy to use. With a simple flip of switch the noise-canceling features are enabled and everything else around you goes silent.The one drawback is that if your are in a moderate to semi-moderately noisy environment the headphones have a high-pitched hissing sound that is hard to ignore. Essentially don't buy these just to ""be cool"" - buy these ONLY if you truly need to cancel out loud noises. Light ambient sound can be ""cancelled"" simply by increasing the volume to your headset and keeping the noise-canceling feature off!"
2,Poor structural quality - don't waste your money,"Even though the noise-cancelling and sound quality are very good with these headphones, the structural quality is very poor. I've had mine just under a year and have glued and taped them many times. The plastic housing keeps cracking and breaking for no apparent reason. And, I don't have a big head! It's obvious that the manufacturer cut corners on the structural quality of these headphones. I would expect the housing to last the lifetime of the phones."
4,Jabra Headphones,I really enjoy the Jabra headphones. The noise cancelling is excellent and sound quality is as well. Wish they were just a bit lighter.
2,It is too warm for my ears,"The sound quality is good. You would notice small hissing sound when the noise-cancellation is on. Also, you can't wear it for too long. The headphones feel like a pair of ear muffs. I can't wear it for more than a half hour."
2,Jabra C820s active noise cancelling stereo headphones,These headphone are not very comfortable. They are also heavy which makes them uncomfortable to wear for a long period of time. The headphones seemed to not fit my ears. They did cancel the noise in the airplane. I also wish they would fold.
2,hand exerciser,"Did not last, and was not what I thought it would be, Son has dysgraphia and did not help with the muscles of his hands."
4,Good Stress Reliever,This came with the keyboard and mouse wrist-rest that I purchased. I have used it a few times and it does stretch the fingers nice. I can see where this might be useful for stressful situations.
3,I felt this was the downfall of the series,"I stated in a review of one of the other books that the books, in my opinion, got dumber with each one. This I feel is the downfall of the series. Its interesting in a sense, yet not entirely. The only kicker I find to this book (that prevented me from giving it 2 stars) was the ending when it is revealed what the child is."
4,This whole series is great and lots of fun to read.,A long review is not necessary. . .this series is extremely well written and very well paced. Good for vampire lovers and mystery lovers as well.
5,I wish I could give this 10 stars!,"If you like to laugh, get this CD. Kathleen Madigan is the funniest female comedian ever- hands down. I listen to a lot of stand up comedy and she is at the top of my list."
3,Good quality,Nice cable with good quality build. Not the longest or the thickest but its purpose is filled and to a great level.
3,Decent Book,"However, a bit repititioThe ideasus. The first half of the book kept seeling itself and giving case examples. The ideas in each chapter were easily understood, but the basic message got lost in the redundancy of how Putnam presented the information. A 'How To' section or training plan for several common sports would be more useful."
4,esther ofarim import 1982,"Very nice tone, great music if you understand hebrew. restfull soft music. nothing i,ve ever listened to can compare, nice!!"
5,A must read for all soldiers,"This book is the literary equivalent of Spielberg's cinemagraphic ""Saving Private Ryan"". Mr. Gajdusek takes you with him on the battlefield with a realism that is frighteningly palpable, yet simply and honestly described. It is a compelling story of the extraordinary mental and physical hardships of the footsoldier in combat. Most valuable, perhaps, is Mr. Gajdusek's treatment of the bizarre emotional conundrums faced by a wounded prisoner. Every soldier and marine should read this book. I dare you to put it down."
2,Why Fi?,"I bought this camera and returned it before even using it's ""revolutionary"" wi-fi capability. I have used Nikon professionally for many years and was excited to see their latest consumer camera. Within 2 hours of testing it out at home, I decided to return it. The major problem I encountered was focusing. This camera would hunt from as far as 3 feet before it could reliably gain focus.Another problem for Parents, or pet owners is the redeye flash, without the rewdeye flash on, it's in every pic, with the redeye active, the preflash is so invasive and long that the moment is long gone before the image is exposed. Exposure was accurate, but color was a bit on the flat and cool side.For what it's worth I exchanged the P2 for the Canon a620. It was $50 cheaper 7.1 mp and much more reliable and speedy performance. No wi-fi, but your uploaded pics will be in focus and well exposed."
3,Pleased with the camera frustrated with the Wifi,"Previous to this model, I had the Coolpix S1 and the Coolpix 800. Overall, I do not see much of an improvement over my Coolpix 800 camera. The P2 has some positives with more additional features and flexibility.I am frustrated with the Wifi. I have spent over 3 days working with getting it setup on my network. I am a very knowledgeable computer/network person but, find this frustrating. The Wifi seems to be a waste of money. I have thought about returning it a couple of times and exchanging it for the Kodak Wifi. The Kodak Wifi is supposed to be much easier to work with. With the Nikon you need to hook it up to the computer and upload profiles to the Nikon which is a real hassle.An update to my review. Nikon has an 800 number for tech support regarding wireless. They helped me setup the camera so, that it can work with my network some of the time."
1,not very good,the camera stopped working after 3 days I'm still trying to figure out is it the batteries are its cameras self will not charge up
1,Poor Nikon support makes this one useless,"Bought this because of the wireless connection.Works fine with Power PC Macs, but Nikon has and will not provide software that will work with Intel Macs.Therefore this was the last Nikon product I ever bought."
2,Iffy Wi-FI,"It's not an item to write home about. Final picture quality is usually OK but not spectacular. The wi-fi works some days, mostly not. If I'd known then what I know now it would still be on the shelf or in the hands of some other poor purchaser."
3,Bay Window Devon Camper type 2,"My name is Yvon (18 years) from the Netherlands, and since I was 15 I dreamed of having a Volkswagen Bus. I think it'll be great to go on vacation with friens and drive for many hours. When you see a very happy girl, driving a car like that...then you know...it's me. I hope i'll get a car like that.Why do I like those cars? I set in the back of a bay window devon once, and it maked me feel like I was in 'the old times'. People smile at you, say that you have a nice car. And you don't see them much. Enough reasons? I think so. Bye to all you lucky people with a VW Bus!!!"
1,Indoor Outdoor Thermometer,"I was very disappointed in this product, particularly compared to other Taylor thermometers I have owned. The back broke very soon after I purchased it. The outdoor temperature was not particularly accurate. I ended up purchasing another model Taylor indoor/outdooor thermometer that was cheaper and works much more effectively."
1,Taylor 1465 Indoor/Outdoor Thermometer,"The indoor temperature function seems to be mostly accurate. The outdoor temperature, however, is off by as much as 15 degrees. I've confirmed that with another unit we have from a different manufacturer, and also by weather reports."
2,A great band's less than stellar effort,"This CD sounds as if the group were simply singing over canned tracks. ""Don't Walk Away Rene""'s ringing and fabulous vocals are grounded hopelessly in synth sounds and passionless tracks. From a band that once had some of the best songwriters in the business, there isn't one original song on this album and while there are some good songs, it is uneven at best. I would hope the group will remember their former artistry and make a strong statement on their next recording, rather than simply settling for riding on past glories. Hey, perhaps they just need some of the old guys back - like Terry Kirkman and Jules Alexander. There's still time for another triumph. This isn't it!"
1,A Whole Lot Less,"Unfortunately, if you're looking for the classic '60s group, it is sadly nowhere to be found here. Slick, schlocky production (keyboards & drum machines) and mostly substandard material are all that remains with the group (featuring original members Russ Giguere & Larry Ramos) being reduced to an Up With People type vocal-only outfit. However pretty the performances might be, when compared to the former stature of what used to be The Association, there's not enough here that warrants anyone's time. Buy the original albums instead, available as imports."
1,Nothing To See Here,"Unbelievable as it seems, The Association did in fact put out an album in the nineties. I suspect you can well imagine the horror. They even have the audacity to cover `Walk Away Renee'. Have they no shame?"
4,Great Introduction to Radio,"If you want to know what the radio industry is all about read this book. It is written by a veteran in the field who has published extensively on the subject, presented research at conferences, and worked in the radio business before entering academe. Dr. Keith knows the business.He traces trends and provides historical perspective on how things came to be as they are. Station managers would find this to be a useful resource manual. There are all kinds of subjects covered that they would face on a daily basis.I recommend this book. I've used it in teaching at the university level over the years. Student feedback has been positive."
1,disappointed,my copy was the e-copy which I downloaded. The document is not printable....not sure why. That as a whole ruined any positive opinion i had from this book. If you think about it....it's more able to be pirated as an e-book than a printable pdf!! Go Figure!!
2,Haynes Repair Manual for 1998 - 2002 Isuzu Amigo,I would not recommend this manual for owners of a 3.2L V6 equipped Amigo. It concentrates on the older models and other engines.
4,awesome treats,"these things are awesome! dogs absolutely love them. one of my dogs just needs to get over the texture each time, takes her about 10 min to eat it. but my other 2 gobble these right up. great for digestion and a great snack if your leaving for a period of time and they need something to hold them over. very filling sweet potatoes!only drawback, THEY NEED TO MAKE A BIGGER BAG!"
5,Great for delicate tummies!,My Bernese puppy is allergic to beef so we had to get rid of the bully sticks. I tried these as an alternative and he loves them. They don't last as long as a bully stick but they do take him a bit to chew up. Great alternative to bully sticks!
1,No Interest,"My dog loves Dogswell sweet potato chews, which I recently learned are made in China. I had hoped that these Sam's Yams would make a good substitute. However, these are much tougher, really like rawhide, and my cockapoo has no interest in the product. I'm not even sure she realizes that it is something to eat. Maybe it would appeal to a larger dog that enjoys chewing."
1,Nevermore,"If I could rate these with less than one star I would. My dogs LOVED them, I gave them one each. The next day they turned out to be gut bombs, diarrhea with chunks of sweet potato in them - in the kitchen, everywhere. Blech. I'm returning them ASAP."
2,Too expensive,"I'm giving 2 stars only because my pup loved the taste of these - but for almost $14 for a 1 lb. bag they're outrageous. With only 8-10 pieces in the bag (pieces are sizeable at approx. 3-4 inches long) my bulldog puppy eats one in about 3 minutes. If Sam's Yams is advertising these as an ""alternative to rawhide"", they should definitely last longer - don't you think? I just purchased a dehydrator and will be making these & other doggie treats (i.e., jerky, dried apples, etc.) myself...they'll be MUCH cheaper, wholesome & no question that what my puppy eats & chews on is ""Made in America!"""
5,"safe, healthy treat for dogs that can't be trusted with rawhide or bully sticks.","My dog has had several surgeries after ingesting foreign objects, so he cannot be safely left with a rawhide chew because of the risk that he will swallow a piece of it that might not pass safely through his intestine. Both of my dogs are crazy about the Sam's yams Big Boyz chews. They are thicker and last longer than other brands I've tried."
2,I really REALLY wanted to love these!,"I really wanted to love these treats! They're healthy and smell wonderful...but my dogs will NOT touch them! I've tried everything..and neither one, a lab mix and a wheaton Havenese mix will not touch them. Not sure why, because they LOVE the duck wrapped sweat potato treats.. I've gotten them beef sticks to chew on, and they're just ok with those..maybe it's my dogs :/"
2,healthy but not a chew at all,"I will start with the good: Made from USA grown sweet potato and healthy. Great website and cool product names.As for everything else I would say save your money,buy organic sweet potato's and let your dogs chew on those. These chews didn't make it three minutes with any of my dogs. I can cut a sweet potato in half and they will have more fum and health benefits for a whole lot less money. To sum this up, if your dogs really wants chews these are the wrong product."
4,My Dog Loved Them! But too pricey.,"I have a large dog, and after she had some health problems, decided to go natural and/or organic with products made in the USA. She absolutely loved these, because they are big and thick, but she gobbled it down in just a few minutes. Only because of the price...I have decided to make my own. I have a dehydrator, and it's pretty easy to make them. I have also found Carolina Prime Sweet Potato Fries, made in the USA, and they are a bit more reasonable, especially when on sale. I decided to rate them a 4, because they are really good, but just too costly."
3,Not for me,"Dolly Parton is one of my favorite artists, and I usually love just about anything she does, but I just couldn't enjoy this album too much. Sure, the sentiment is nice, but I just can't relate. I'm not an American, not even religious, so to me it sounds like she's just preaching on this CD, when really she is just celebrating. So I think anyone who is patriotic and loves America would enjoy this CD, I just can't relate to it. She wrote most of the songs, and added her own flair to old favorites. It's not an essential album by any means, and I hope she will release an album of new material soon. It seems she will be promoting this one for a while now though."
2,A Mixed Bag,"The spiritual songs on this album are actually pretty good. patron's voice is in fine form, and the instrumentation compliments the overall arrangements very well. The ""patriotic"" songs however are a different matter. There is little imagination in either their selection or their production and the canned laughter and cornball humor only underscore that. Overall, this one is not a particularly good addition to the Parton catalog and a deep disappointment for those of us so enthralled by her return to her roots she has been doing over the past few years."
2,"Well Meaning, But Not Always Well Done","I disagree with those who say that Dolly is just trying to cash in with this album, as I do think it comes across as very heartfelt and sincere. At the same time I think the results are less than enjoyable mainly due to a lack of originality in the song selection and worse the forced humor emphasized by the can laughter. Sincere this album is. Subtle it is not."
2,"Ugh, You will do much better with other offerings","This CD is WAY over produced and dopey. If it weren't Dolly singing, I would have returned the CD."
2,Not the Dolly I love,"I'm a big Dolly fan, but somehow this album just didn't ""fit."" I was quite disappointed and would not buy it again it I could do it over. I've only listened to it three or four times since purchasing it, and liked it less each time. I dunno, it just isn't the Dolly I love...."
1,Tacky....I'de give it 0 if i could,It seems that parton is cashing in on the war and sep. 11 just like Toby Keith Darryl Worley and so many others did. The music is just about as bad as the album cover. Just more tacky music by the queen of tackyness herself. This is just as bad as her hollywood pop music from the late 70's and 80's. Parton left country music for pop music and got away with it then just like shania twain gets away with it today. But make no mistake parton CAN sing but should stick to COUNTRY music. But I dont understand why parton got away with making some of the most tacky patriotic music ever while Toby Keith and Darryl Worley were Criticised to he11. That makes no sense. I dont think parton is any better than anyone else and SHOULD get Criticised whene the time is right. This cd is just not worth the money.
1,"Coast, not cash",I don't think that Ms. Parton is cashing in as much as she is just coasting. After a string of excellent return to her roots albums she is simply churning out the kind of album she could do in her sleep. The presence of canned laughter and corn ball humor seems to be here to try to de-emphasize that notion. Forget this one and await her next roots project.
2,Dolly's Genius Streak is Apparently Over,"If you, like me, have been following Dolly's career for the last twenty years, then you probably were thrilled when you heard she was intending to release a heartfelt album featuring gospel, inspirational and patriotic songs. After all, gospel has always been one of Dolly's stronger suits. And the last four or five albums from Dolly have been sheer genius.This is, however, one of the most disappointing collections of Ms. Parton's long and prosperous career. Songs like ""God Bless the USA"" and ""Tie a Yellow Ribbon"" have been recorded to death lately, and Dolly's rendition doesn't bring anything new. An almost laughable bluegrass rendition of ""My Country Tis of Thee"" proves that just because you can make a bluegrass arrangement of a song doesnt mean you should.If it weren't for a heartbreaking original tune ""Welcome Home"" and the rerecording of an old Dolly classic ""Light of a Clear Blue Morning"" this album would be a total bust."
3,I don't know....,"First I have to say, I'm a fan of Dolly for about, I think 20 years.... since her duet with Kenny Rogers ""Islands in the stream"".I bought all of her albums, and I love them all.But ""For God and Country"" is not a favorite for me. Maybe it's because I'm no American.I don't like those patriotic songs, and the glory of war.I know, this album is meant for the soldiers and their families, but, like I said, it does not work on me.That was the first album of Dolly for years which was not released in Germany. I had to buy it as an import, for almost 25 , and that's very expensive.And now I'm a little bit disappointed.I love Dolly and her voice (that's why I gave 3 stars), but I don't like that album."
2,Gotta respect her,She is doing what she wants which is more than I can say for most female artists today. on the other hand a lot (but not all) of the patriotic songs aren't too great and for the most part this cd is so heavily produced and makes me yearn for her more stripped down albums. Try little sparrow.
2,"Look great, but a bit small and uncomfortable.","These look awesome, but I am a size 10 and I can barely get my feet in them.The rough uncomfortable parts that some Orr reviewers mention I believe are seems where the material is sown together. I a also noticing at a seem is coming undone, likely due to trying to get my feet inside ( and needing to force them open a bit to do so).I think if these we actually a size 12 then those issues would be less likely to be a bother."
4,Type on the price!,"I totally understand this is more likely a typo, but if you intend to sell any of these slippers, I highly suggest you check the prices as they are online on other websites for $40.00 $1,000 for a pair of slippers is going to run your customers off and they won't check your other products. Just some friendly advice from another online entrepreneur striving for the American dream! Merry Christmas! :D"
1,Thousand dollars?,"These would be awesome to get BUT they use to be 40 dollars and now I see they have them listed at 999.99? That is just insane, who do these people think they are? I really wanted a pair but I would have to be legally insane to pay a thousand dollars for them, this should be illegal."
4,Not true to size,"BEWARE! I love these slippers, however they are not true to size. They are advertised as ""Fit Men's Sizes 8-12"". No way in heck. I wear an 8.5 men's shoe. These things are snug. If I wear socks with them they are tooo small.On another note, they are durable. When I walk in them, my dog attacks them. I can even drag him along. No signs of wear and tear."
2,What the hell is that cardboard stuff digging into my feet?!,"Maybe I made a mistake here as the slippers don't seem to fit very well on my clownshoe feet, but my feet could technically fit easily into the slippers with a snug, perhaps tight fit.What ruins that is the fact that the rabbit's jaws have cardboard or plastic sheets or something in them, which extends FAR back, and digs into the tops of my feet for an extremely uncomfortable, almost painful feeling. I try pulling it up, and it relieves the tension, but as soon as I let go, it's back.There's no opening by which I can remove these, I think. Are they supposed to be there? Can I cut open the slippers and remove them safely?"
5,"Nice, warm, and soft","These slippers are wonderful. Not only are they fun and funny, but they are very soft, warm and plush. I sleep in them, they are so comfortable."
5,killer bunny slippers,"Ok first off I bought them for my son in law. He and my daughter love them. Your're never really sure if a slipper will fit unless you try it on first and other reviews said it ran small, however they were perfect I'm told. However delievery time was quiet a bit longer than I expected. Almost 2 months. On back order. I was notified the first day after I ordered they were out of stock but recieved several e-mails about it's estimated delievery."
2,"Interesting & informative, but mis-titled","I did read the book cover to cover, in one evening. Although it was interesting reading, it did not do diddly-squat to tell me ""How to Make a Fortune in the Next Trillion Dollar Industry."" If you are looking for some history of the wellness industry laced with anecdotes, this is entertaining. If you are looking for useful information in choosing and running a business in the wellness industry, you might feel like you wasted your time. The ""how to"" part of the book is just about nonexistent."
2,Mine went in the trash,"This book really didn't tell me a whole lot I didn't already know. Probably the only part that I really paused to think about was the link between the ""sick care"" industry and the food industry. I already know about how processed our foods are and are lacking nutrition. As a benefits specialist for my employer, I found of the information about the insurance to be somewhat misleading. This book probably would have been great about fifteen years ago, but we are already here now. Save your money, most of the information here can be found in other sources and I was really wondering how I was going to make my ""fortune"" in the health care industry and I'm not about to sell medical insurance."
2,Good for cheerleading MLM'ers,"Pilzer does a good job of explaining the problems of the current model in healthcare that focuses on sickness instead of wellness. It is true that great changes must (and will) change in the health care field. Where Pilzer makes his mistake is in thinking that something called ""wellness insurance"" will pay for it. Read this book if you want to gain enthusiasm for your MLM supplement business and encourage those in your ""downline"", but otherwise I did not find Pilzer's business idea of selling clients Medical Savings Account insurance policies, and having them invest their savings in your wellness product, that compelling."
1,Hard to see,"This has the potential, a great man on the table, nice guy doing the massage but the camera angles the draping and the talking that he does through out the massage is distracting he should have done a great massage with a camera over the table so we could see the moves then voiced over the instructions. do not recommend"
4,improve your golf,"I didn't follow the instructions in this book completely. Instead of following the 21 day program I read the book in one sitting. I was able to take several ideas from it however, and applied it during my next round of golf. I hit further and straighter. Some basic info that really works."
5,Highly recommended for the weekend golfer,This book is written in everyday english and common sense for the weekend golfer to understand.Each chapter is a lesson that can be practiced in your yard or in the house...which is very convenient if getting to the range is difficult. The first six chapters alone are worth the price of the book.I've consistently broken 100 since reading this book and practicing it's lessons.
3,good but not great,"a few observations about these...VERY narrow field of view, useful only for truely long distance observation. focus not only shifts during zoom but in my experience is very difficult to get it to focus sharply while at max zoom...focus and image is absolutely fabulous at less than max zoom levels...this will probably go in the closet for use on my boat, I will be buying some else for casual ""site seeing"" terrestrial viewing. good but not great...not an all-in-one, best of both worlds unit as I expected."
1,Truly Horrible,"I am a big fan of Smith and of The Fall - one of the great rock and roll bands, ever. But this album, which strips the garage-rock trappings away from his somewhat pretentious poetic ramblings, is truly horrible. Definitely this is one of the worst and least musical projects ever committed to record, reminding me only of Robert Wyatt's unbelievably bad ""The End of an Ear""."
1,disappointing,The sound reproduction distorted otherwise melodious voices. The voices were harsh and irritating. I routinely enjoy the Irish Tenors but this was a major disappointment.
3,Unfortunate!!!!!!!,"As a long-time Irish Tenor fan--I could not wait for this DVD. What a disappointment. I must say that this would have been a fine concert if Ronan would have stayed home. He was pathetic--rushing, and trying to dominate. I felt sorry for Anthony and Finbar during this production."
5,Irish Tenors - In Concert With the Chicagoland Pops Orchestra,I purchased the item from Amazon. It was received promptly within the specified time and in good condition.
5,The Irish Tenors,I love the DVD because it has old songs and songs and I alsolike the group as well I am part Irish myself
2,boring,"It's very short,I expected more technical information, distribution of different instruments, why are they placed to the left or to the right,it's supposed to be a guide to the orchestra. Pity it has no subtitles, something one automatically expects. The most interesting thing: details on the actual making of some instruments."
3,music plus and minus,found the subject matter to be intrestingly explanded but found the graffics to be of almost poor quality!!!!!
5,Best Superromance Ever!,"I was really surprised to find out the heroine has been battling cancer. The twist in this story is remarkable. Having given up her baby at 17, she never expects to see the child. But because she's a cancer survivor, she's advised to resolve any problem in her past that has brought her stess in the hope that she will stay in remission. The hero kept their baby to raise. Now Jessica is 13 and he has just received a phone call from her mother. She wants to see Jessica, if it's okay with him. Wow. The story takes off from there. I laughed and cried all the way through it. A keeper if there ever was one."
5,awesome pita!,"I love, love, love this pita bread. Its soft, not too dense, and is low carb to boot. An entire pita is only 60 calories. SIXTY calories. It doesn't get much better. My one complaint is that it is really hard to find in brick-and-mortar stores. Some Walmart's used to carry it, but I haven't been able to find it for months. The last time I was visiting family in LA, I found it and bought 7 packs of it so I could take it back home with me! It holds up well in the freezer. If I continue to be unable to find it in a store, I'll be forced to buy it online and pay shipping charges."
5,Anti Brain drain device,"Feeling like you play a game and you come away lesser of a person for giveing it your time, well this game will do the opposite.You suck the game dry and your brain is the benefactor for it.Don't give up , GET EVEN."
2,Not as much fun as Brain Age or Brain Academy,"As an adult gamer, I didn't care for this game. I have tried Brain Age and I think it's so much better than Brain Boost: Gemma Wave. Brain Boost is just a memory game, period. There is nothing else to do on it except just to test your memory. 3 ways to test your memory, numbers, pictures and colors. Each test was pretty long. After awhile I got bored with it quickly. For variety, get Brain Age or Brain Academy.Even my nephews ages, 7 and 8 didn't care for it either. They liked Brain Age better."
2,Try Brain Age instead!,"The background story is extremely silly, and there's no way to measure your progress.Brain Ageis the better deal, as you can compare the results of multiple users, and it also has Sudoku."
3,too much outdated information,"Ok text book, but needs an update in the worst way. Too much film screen and not enough digital. Film screen is virtually history now, in fact there are almost no questions on the registry regarding film screen.I know Mr. Bushong is predisposed with other life issues, but if they don't get with the program, some other text book will knock this off the pedestal"
4,New 10th Edition,"The 10th edition (2012) of this excellently written but error prone Radiologic Science textbook is currently (2/23/2012) available for pre-order. My hope is that the editors have taken the necessary time to correct any errors in this edition's math and physics formulas and examples. It is also my hope that digital technology is presented more prominently, throughout the text, in this new edition. That said, the new edition should provide an improved educational experience for Radiology students beginning with the summer and fall 2012 semesters."
4,Comes in handy,"This is not the main book that I learn out of in class, but when it comes to studying it's another source to look into. In every chapter there are small boxes at the end of each subtitle that sums it up into a sentence or two of what the key information is."
5,Hits the mark...,"This book is very good in accurately and easily describing the x-ray system, fluoroscopy, radiologic physics, artifacts, and digital x-ray imaging. This book greatly helped me in school and served as an outstanding study reference for the ARRT exam. This book ranks high along with ""The Ultimate Study Guide for the Registry Examination in Radiography: Key Review Questions and Answers"",Volumes 1 and 2 by Patrick Leonardi. These volumes had tons of pertinent questions/answers for ARRT prep. ""Radiologic Science for Technologists: Physics, Biology and Protection"" by Stewart C. Bushong will also continue to serve as a reference for years to come."
1,Not a good experience.,"It took me three weeks to find out I was not receiving my book, and another three weeks to get my refund."
3,Review of Seller's Performance,Great Job! My book was sent out to me on time as promised. Your conscientious work ethic was appreciated very much!
4,This might have gotten five stars but for the last bit.,"(This review contains spoilers.)This is certainly a very lush and evocative coming-of-age story, sounding much more YA-ish (conflicts with parents, missing friends, crush on boy) in the first half than the second. I particularly liked the way Benita's mother was drawn, and I thought her father's boorish behavior and conflicts with the natives were (sadly) about what you would expect would happen in real life. However, the last part -- ""suddenly we all get along like BFFs even though we were at each other's throats last time we appeared in the book"" didn't quite ring true for me. I'm not saying Benita should have to come home to the ravaged foundation of her family's house and scorched fields of their plantation, but the sudden spirit of happy cooperation between Dad and the islanders just didn't jibe.I can't make up my mind about the old woman. Real-life hermit, witch or shape-shifter? Or all three?"
5,Land and Strings,"Harold Land is not exactly a household name in jazz. That's because he's a quiet sort who doesn't like to blow his own horn (pun intended).Minus the embouchure, Land's an introvert, but what pours through his axe is everything you could hope to know about his personal gentility, his musical aggressiveness, his romantic nature and his deep spirituality--a dedication to Zen Buddhism that permeates his life.On this album he is backed up by an orchestra arranged and conducted by Ray Ellis.His actual group is a quintet, & Land shows himself to be an excellent balladeer with tunes like ""You Don't Know What Love Is,"" In a Sentimental Mood,"" ""But Beautiful"" & ""Round Midnight.""I'd have to rank him with the great ballad players like Chet Baker, Miles Davis, Dexter Gordon, not to mention Charlie Parker & Kenny Burrell.I think you'll enjoy this album. I know I did."
5,Simply Amazing!,"""The Real-Time Contact Center: Strategies, Tactics and Technologies for Building A Profitable Service and Sales Operation"" is simply an amazing book! This is a must have for any call center practitioner that has a passion for leveraging their contact center operation as a strategic weapon in their respective enterprise.Donna Fluss has extensive experience in the call center space and lays out a clear and succinct road map for organizations to invest heavily in the call center infrastructure as a way to differentiate itself from its competitors.This is definitely a MUST HAVE and offers practical thought leadership for call center practitioners at every level.Art HallVP, Sales & Customer Care, NetBank, Inc.President, CRM Association, Atlanta Chapter"
4,Educational and Fun,I purchased these for my two year old daughter and she has fun with them. It comes with a lot of cards which is great but I think a little overwhelming for her at this age. I typically just put out a small assortment and we match those up and if she's still interested I'll put out some more. I think once she's a little older and can do all the cards it will be even better. The quality of the cards is great and they are nice and big.
5,These are fantastic,"Big, very sturdy, bright colors, clear pictures, and lots of educational fun for my 2-year-old. At first, he just liked looking at the pieces but didn't quite get the concept of matching; now, he can match them and put them all together. A great teaching tool, surprisingly good quality considering the price. Highly recommended."
5,Great product!,"This is great for children 1+ you can use half of the cards to teach a one year old new vocabulary words. As the child gets older, it can be used as a matching game for higher learning. I'm very happy with this product. Strong durable cards too, for kids that still like to chew on everything!"
2,Boring,"I had high hopes for these, but have yet to find a kid who will play with them! Both of our kids find them boring, and older ones as well. Great concept, but probably too complex for the age group advertised."
3,Not many textured pieces,"We just got this toy today and I was excited to have my son start playing with it when we got home. The product/idea is great. I just thought that there would be texture on each piece so that the child could learn to match by color, word, shape or texture. Only about 4 pieces out of 20 have texture on them."
3,"cute, but they could have done better...","Pros:CuteGood conceptBright colorsEasy for kids to understand (basic words, colors, and textures)Cons:No storage for pieces other than the original box, which no kid this age could open on their own, and they don't even fit in that well, just slop around in it.Can be confusing for kids, when they try to match up, for example, a green lizard with the color green, they are basically told they are wrong since the piece won't fit, the frog is green, the lizard is rough... but I think making the connection of the lizard being green as well is just as important..."
5,Sturdy puzzle,"Love the concept of this puzzle. The carrying box is a bit strange....you have to take all the pieces apart to get them in. I understand the cube design of the box, but something that would fit the pieces put together might make more sense. We have ditched the box and put the pieces is a $1 basket. Enjoyable and educational. Very sturdy."
4,Educational,"My 21 month old really enjoy these cards. Similar to the other review, he is able to find matches for several of the pieces but he can't put it together. We have a lot of fun learning new words and teaching him to find the matching texture or color."
5,GREAT & LOVELY,"These princess cut cubic zirconia studs were bought for a gift, of course didnt see them before giving them because I shipped them directly and reactions gave me the approval, also they look way better than advertised!! sparkly sparkly!!, and very important was a super fast shipping and I didnt pay extra for it, was shipped on valentines day but it was expected february 17 so that was a plus for the gift surprise!! no regrets!! couldnt ask for more.. oh yea gift wrapping please!"
5,Amnesty,"Forgiveness is not always simple, yet that is not supposed to be an excuse for avoiding it.Lutheran pastor Rick Rouse had a textbook excuse for ""throwing the book"" (or maybe the Bible) at his offender. Completely unprovoked, a serial arsonist burned Rouse's church to the ground.The congregation and community were understandable devastated and many called for the kind of justice that would lock the arsonist away from both society and their memories. However, Rouse and his church dug deep into the bottomless heart of God and found a vision to build a relationship with their offender and his family.In Fire of Grace, Pastor Rouse creates a priceless picture of spiritual amnesty--the type of grace that is the foundation of the Christian faith. And although in the case of Rouse's church, grace unfolded in a series of complex stages, the results proved why forgiveness is a practice we should all engage more regularly."
5,IT IS SO NICE,THE GUN U PRODUCE IS SO NICE THAT I WANTED TO BUY IT BUT I AM LEAVING IN SINGAPORE SO I CAN'T BUY THE AIRGUN BUT IF U HAVE A IDEAL TO SENT IT TO HERE I WILL PAY DOUBLE
4,"Good, low price weather monitor","This product does a good job monitoring the temperature at the base location & one remote location (included). The humidity sensor is only for the base location. The weather forecaster doesn't always match up with the actual weather (the instructions are a little unclear if you should set it to the actual weather, or the prediction for the next day). Does not measure wind speed, and thus windchill. Large readout, able to take up to 3 remote sensors. Overall, a good product."
2,not accurate who wants a clock,"I have both the remote and indoor unit sitting next to each other and they are off by 5 degrees -- So its not very accuratenot very accurate.Next, I realize caveat emptor, but the unit is 7"" by 10"" but the display is only 3x 5Now the reason to buy a digital thermometer is to see the temperature especially out side. Everyone has a watch, clocks, cell phones computers, etc. So why make the time disply gigantic and the temperature tiny?? I know its my fault for not looking closely--but this is why you need to go to brick and mortar and not buy on the internet.I threw it away because it was ergonomically discusting and ordered a product from another manufacturer"
5,Comprehensive,This book is truly wonderful! It is set up well and really covers every topic. I've also heard that some of the boards questions came out of this book! A great prep for the pediatric NP boards exam.
5,SUper book!,Love it! has everything! very well organized has very good details and it has been very helpful. If you r in peds rotation is a number 1 book for you :)
4,Used to prepare for CPN exam,I used this book to prepare for my CPN exam and there were actually questions on the test that were straight from the book. I was hoping it had more questions but I think it has just the perfect amount of questions and review material. I highly suggest this book for anyone taking their CPN or even if you are getting your MSN and are in school.
5,Fantastic!,"I think this is a great book. I've bought videos, and even Mr. Brungardt's other books. They're all too complicated. This provides some simple, basic exercises in an easy-to-follow format. I have been doing this for a month and I can already see the results. In fairness, two things: it's more like 10-15 minutes and not three, when you consider stretching, etc. Also, if you are already spending two hours a day at the gym, this book will seem remedial to you. But if you are a beginner/intermediate, it's a great routine that will get you results."
4,About what you'd expect.,"A fine book for people who want to get a quick start at an ab workout. The title is a bit embarassing if you're the kind of person whos abs betray an ADD approach to exercise, but the book is small and unobtrusive enough to be easily hidden from nagging girlfriends."
3,"3 minute abs? Yes, Seeable? No","It's true that you don't need 1000 crunches a day or more than 15 minutes to have perfect abs. The problem is that if you have a very thin layer of fat that covers them, NOONE will be able to see them. You have to burn all these fat and this requires to do aerobics at least 3 times a week for 30-60minutes. I am also surprised by the other readers that said their fat went down just by doing abs. ANY serious dietitian will tell you that there is no such thing as ""spot reduction"""
2,Only for the very beginners,"This book is dumb. kurt spents all the book, telling about how important the ""mental thing"" is. He takes only 10 pages to tell us the reason we bought his book ABS. Yes very few exercises, not convincent, very poor writen I felt I've just bought those miracle gadgets from TV. I really don't know why american trainers prefer spend half of the book teaching about mental stuff, instead focus on the real train. I'm not against mental train I just think, motivation is subjective and should be taught by a psycologist."
4,Very Effective,If you want to get definition and build your abs this is the book to get. It's worked for me. The only problem is you have to wait a long time and be patient. You have to wait at least four to six weeks before you see any results. You also have to maintain some sort of cardio workout of your choice to help this program work. It will take a few months to start seeing really noticeable results but if you are determined enough it will be worth it.
2,slim down your waist or JUST A WASTE?,"I bought 3 min abs after reading awesome reviews about it. I was so excited that I told all of my friends about it. One problem: I already had a six-pack and wanted increased definition and size. Why not? The book is entitled ""Achieving the Look You've Always Wanted."" If this describes your ab desires than this book is not for you. HOWEVER, if you are of an average build, this book WILL slim down your waist."
3,What about when somebody comes up with 2 min abs?,"It may sound revolutionary, but what if someone came out with 2 minute abs? Then this book would be irrelavent, and everybody would feel lame for wasting all those extra minutes.Remember 8 minute abs, and all the research that went into breaking that barrier? Well I know I was pretty shocked when I heard about 7 min abs. Then all the news papers were following the 'Abs Race' as each minute barrier was successfully broken. Believe me, I'm just as impressed with three minutes as you, but I think we can do a little better. Don't buy an ab video program until we are ABsolutely sure the limit has been reached!"
5,awesome!,"This is one of my all time favorites, I go back to it time and time again. The amount of info in this book is amazing, the illustrations are great too. It's in my top five, there is something in there for anyone"
2,Lacking....,"I got this book back in '93? I believe. It's been awhile. Still sitting on the shelf. I am a HUGE massive lover of authentic victorian history, novels and anything connected. I was expecting more. This is a ""quaint""...at times silly book. She just picks things out of the air. In all her other books are not very well researched either. I don't think she even does research.This isn't true or authentic victorian anything. If that's what you're looking for...beware. If you want some cutesy, glorfied ""idea"" of what victorians did and were....get this."
1,Hoodwinked by Amazon,"THIS IS ONLY THE TRANSMITTER, NOT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. If you search for AVS-5813 you will find the REQUIRED, companion receiver for this item. Amazon does NOT tell you this, but you will figure it out when you receive the item, open up the box to find a completely plain white box, and only 1 unit inside.Hopefully my comments will prevent some other poor shmuck from thinkg they are getting a great deal only to find they have to pay twice as much for a working system.I will write another review when I receive my receiver and try out the units."
2,Great...While It Lasts,"Similar to another reviewer's experience, I really like this unit (and its receiver unit), but there's a caveat. It works well sending signal from my TiVo in the living room to my office, where I have a TV monitor and the audio running through a decent sound system on the computer. However, after a few months, both of the units I've bought have died. I'm to the point now where I'm looking for alternatives, but so far I'm coming up with nothing else comparable in functionality. I really like the capability to use the TiVo remote from the office. When it works. :("
5,Works Great!!!,I bought both Transmitter and Receiver about a month ago. Picture and sound quality is very good. Just bought a second receiver for my basement. Picture and sound quality also very good. NO MESS NO FUSS. Excellent product.
3,RF Link Transmitter/Receiver,"When I first installed this product I installed the receiver outside in the backyard and the transmitter inside nearby. The picture was poor and the sound was filled with noise. Then, remembering that my portable phone was also 5.8G, I turned the phone off. The picture was now great and the sound was fine. Changing the channels on the transmitter/receiver did not help. Only turning the phone off cured the problem.Thus, if you are thinking of getting this don't if you have 5.8G portable phones in your house. Otherwise, product works as advertised."
1,Remote doesn't work!,"Bought this unit to watch my DirecTV in the bedroom (unit in the living room). Set-up was fine and picture/audio work well, not too much interference, although the bedroom is on the same floor right down the hall. Remote does not repond, however. It did once the first day, actually, to tell me I had to turn off the HD feature on the unit. Why, I have no idea. The remote worked fine for half the day, but never again. Returned the unit to Amazon, who replaced it immediately. Same story with the second unit. Read the reviews on here, and the forum on the cutomer service page, but even moving the mouse around to different locations didn't help. Also, I read some reviews that you could watch different programs on each tv, which was never an option for me. Great idea, but don't buy unless someone in the bedroom is willing to watch whatever the person in the living room is watching."
1,Great when it worked.,Same as the other reviewers. Worked great when it still worked. Now after about 5 months it's dead. No more audio at all.
1,RF Link AVS-5812 Wireless Video Sender,"I bought this unit as a replacement. My old one defaulted to channel 1, the video was noisy, and the channel could not be changed. Had used the old unit for over 5 years. The new unit would change channels okay but it produced whitish, almost colorless video. The old unit came with a 500ma power adapter. The new unit came with a 300ma adapter. The new unit would not work properly with either the 300ma or the 500ma adapter. RF link website says 400~500ma should work fine. Asked them why I received a 300ma adapter, and if it was acceptable. No response yet. Using the old unit with the video noise lines until I receive the replacement from Amazon.com."
2,Another failure after one year.,"The Sender unit failed after about one year of operation. The image became erratic sending a good image for 1/2 second after one minute of garbage. The sender is locked to channel 1, unable to settle on the other channels, no matter how many times the channel select is clicked. MY review is to buttress the experience of other reviewers, that this product is badly flawed and should be avoided."
2,Was nice while it lasted.,"This product worked quite well for transmitting AV signals from my cable box to the TV in my kitchen. Until it died. My transmitter just stopped working. After 2 months of owning the unit.Doesn't seem to have a very long life, and that is a frustrating shame, considering the cost.What a disappointment."
2,"Little Suspense, Haphazard Plotline","A good thing is the book is not too long, doesn't have too many extraneous pages just to expand length. Also, the author doesn't o too much into medical details & such, which seems to be the rage these days, often with erroneous results. However, there is little suspense, the writing at times is amateurish (like the repeated descriptions of women)& the plot trying to create a complexity actually makes it less interesting & less beleivable. I think the idea was good, but the author just doesn't seem to have the sharpness to be a great thriller writer."
1,Terrible,"This book had zero suspense, and no building action. The plot had holes big enough to drive a truck through. The dialogue was contrived, and all of the characters were the worst stereotypes of cops and bad guys I've ever read. Save yourself time and money, do not read this book."
3,"cute, not really a book!",This book was pretty cute with adorable pictures. I was hoping for a funny book to read during the last couple months. The is really one scentence per page. Not quite what I had in mind.It would be a cute add on gift for a shower.
5,A great design resource.,"Good designs, both traditional and novel. Helpful ideas and practical construction assistance. I Will keep this book around for a long time to come"
2,Bad movie,"What can I say? Husband treats wife horribly and wants out of marriage. Husband cheats on wife. Wife cheats with pool boy. Pool boy cheats with teeny bobber friend. Wife gets psycho obsessive over pool boy and kidnaps teeny-bopper. Everyone lives unhappily ever after.Jan-Michael Vincent does his usual sub-standard acting job.Myndi Miller plays a fine sex starved psycho.Linnea Quiggly is her usual, vapid, stereo-typed, sexy teenager role.I hope Ken Abraham's acting got better the more jobs he got (if any).Let the buyer beware on this one."
4,Great way to attract pet hair!!!!,"The Doskocil Pet Hair Magnet has greatly helped to remove pet hair from our clothes and furniture. We have four animals and all four are in and out of the house constantly, so we tend to have lots of hair floating around.I read reviews from others that have purchased this product to make sure it was something I would like to try and thought might work and was impressed by what I read.We would recommend this product to anyone who loves to have their pet in the house and still keep it free of pet hair!!!!"
2,Save your money!,"This is a great tool... for about two weeks. The ridges on the blade wear quickly and once dull, the tool looses effectiveness."
1,Doesn't work,Simply does not pick up the dog hair at all. A waste of money though I guess that's what you get when you buy something for 10.00
1,does not work,i thought this would help buy NO!................. i have 3 small dogs not one hair came up off my furniture :(
1,Does NOT work,"I agree with the users who gave this one star -- this just does NOT work to pick up hair. I have long-haired cats that have soft hair that clings to the furniture (and everything else). I bought this to clean the furniture, and it does nothing. Do not buy this."
5,Best pet hair remover EVER for carpeted stairs!,"We have cats and BIG HAIRY dogs in our house. I have NEVER found a product that works as good as the Pet Hair Magnet to clean my stairs. The shape/design enables you to get into the corners and crevices of your stairs easily and drags the hair right out. Even stubborn hair! I start at the top of the stairs and work all the hair into the center of each step and work my way down. Then, just take your hose attachment on the sweeper and just suck it right up. Amazing, simple and I do not have to try and use my sweeper on each step! A MUST HAVE for any pet owner with carpeted stairs!"
2,Waste of Money,"This product does scrape up the pet hair off of furnature. However, it takes a TON of elbow grease! Way too much work to give the credit to the product. I get the same result from a wet sponge."
4,Works well on fleece too,"Bought this to battle fur from two long-hair cats. Works fairly well on the sofa & love seat slipcovers, although only if I pull the fabric taut. I also still need to use it in conjunction with one of those sticky lint removers, which pick up the piles of fur that the Pet Hair Magnet gathers into little tufts. I've found the Pet Hair Magnet also works really well on fleece - blankets, pullovers, etc. Bonus. 8-)"
2,It works but a brush can do the job,"I bought this and used it to rake off the dog hair on the seats of my corolla and dog beds. It doesn't work if you sweep it over a large area once. You have to use smaller strokes while overlapping the areas you sweep as you go in one direction. With the pet hair magnet I was able to bundle up all the hair and easily remove it. Honestly, if you used any comb or a grooming brush you would be able to remove just as much hair. Some people may get the wrong impression from the name of the product. Its not really a magnet, it is just a piece of rubber with toothed edges.FYI I have a jindo mix and a golden retriever, breeds that shed ALOT!"
2,Barely works.,"I have two longer haired cats. I read the instructions, and used it exactly as explained. It does manage to get some hair but I think the sticky rollers do a far better job."
5,fur squeegee,"i have spent 30 minute on net trying to find this item as my son ""borrowed"" mine and it has not been returned.....i used many descriptive words to try and find this....would never think of pet hair magnet....so glad it popped up on amazon by itself or i never would have found this irreplaceable 5 star tool!!! buying two, not taking any more chances on being without it!!"
5,Got the hair out,"We used it on some blankets that were very difficult to get the cat hair out of, and it worked. That is the only thing we found that worked on this one blanket."
5,"Petmate Pet Hair Magnet, Yellow","This is a nifty little device for cleaning the upholstery. At only one dollar I could not beat the price. I get quite a workout using this, but, it works well. I spritz a little water on the upholstery first then use it, but, it doesn't have to be used that way. It is a lot cheaper than using those sticky rollers since it can be used many times. Clever cleaning tool."
4,It works!,"The Pet Hair Magnet definitely works and works well. You do have to put a small amount of effort into it, though. It doesn't just hop on by itself. It gets ALL the hair into a nice pile for you to dispose of. It's exactly what I needed."
4,"Not perfect, but pretty darn good.","As with a couple other styles of hair remover, this product does what it says, and removes most pet hair from most fabrics. It falls a little short, as with most others I've tried, in getting all the hair embedded in the coarser fabrics like the couch or chair. That said, it produces a vast improvement when you use it, but it's not perfect."
1,Waste of Money,"My cleaning lady recommended this product. I have two cats. I use my vacuum typically or the Pledge Fabric Sweeper (which I still love and still use!). I don't know if it's because my couch is microfiber or what, but this thing is worthless. It didn't ""attract"" hair... it merely swept it into a pile, similar to what I can do with my hand... I'm often skeptical of these ""as seen on TV items"" and this is exactly why... however, my cleaning lady said another one of her clients uses it and likes it... who knows..."
4,"Decent little mirror, but pouch could be better","This is a good, sturdy little mirror for your purse. It's easy to use and having one side that magnifies is a great feature. The only downside is the pouch. After using it for only two months it began to loose it's shape. Also, it picks up every speck of lint because of its velour like finish. In any case, I would buy it again in spite of the pouch."
3,functional,"The mirror looks much better online than in person. The finish is a brushed silver, I thought it would be a polished silver... not sure why, it doesnt say that it is. The mirror does not have a clasp to hold it closed, it just folds shut. The case for the mirror is velvet-ish on the outside and plastic on the inside.Overall I gave it a 3, for the price it is ok. I don't regret buying it, will be handy to carry in my purse."
4,Good buy,"Charles Vess has put together nothing but good artwork and Jeff Smith has crafted some of the finest story lines in comic books ever, just on that, you cannot really go wrong.This book is different from ""Bone"", but still helps to teach you more about the same universe and the history of these characters that we have loved in ""Bone"".If you are a Bone fan, you have to check it out. If you are just a fan of fantasy comics, then it is worth checking out you you."
5,Bone-tastic,Got it for my child who is Bone-obsessed. She enjoyed it.Ended up reading it myself. Got me hooked on Bone now too.
4,Great Book,This book was intersting and i liked it but compared to the actually series it was kinda boring but if you really like the bones series its a good book
2,Unnecessary,"If, after reading all 1300 pages of Bone, you felt a desperate need to find out more about Rose's backstory, then this book is for you. Unfortunately, that's where its merits end. Apart from fleshing out the story we already know (without expanding the Bone universe or introducing any interesting new characters), there's nothing going on in Rose. Gone is the sharp humor that made the original Bone work so well; instead, you get page after page of exposition and meaningless exchanges.Then there's the title character herself. The old Rose we met in Bone was intriguing, full of secrets and grinning in the face of all but the gravest danger. But the young version we meet is just a nave teenager, with nothing distinctive about her.Overall, Rose is a forgettable fantasy story, and nothing more."
2,disappointed,"If you have read the Bone series you will find little new story in here, you pretty much know these events / characters (maybe not with all the details) that are laid out. And if you had not read the Bone series you should NOT read this first because it reveals some of the mysteries that make reading Bone so exiting.So at the end, whether you read Bone before or not, this book is not good for anyone.The drawings are very good, very well done, I am almost willing to call it 'artwork' as some do, but it is little relief for the lack of new story.Making a prequel is difficult since readers already know how it ends, but authors sometime succeed. Not this time. I feel this was made just to milk the fans of the series, like me."
2,it isn't Bone,"If you're expecting the quality of the Bone series, look elsewhere. The art is dramatically less refined and the execution isn't high. I was entranced by the Bone series and wanted to discover more of the same, but this just isn't it."
5,Marvellous account of an owl family!,"I've followed the lives of a pair of barred owl, June and Ward, on the Owl Cam website several years ago, thanks to the wonderful man who built the owlbox, photographed and filmed the pair's broods of owlets through at least three years. He finally put together this DVD account of June and Ward's first family--from June's laying of three eggs to the hatching, feeding, and first flight of the owlets. The photography is clear and vivid, with many amazing closeups of the owls and other wildlife in this verdant forest in America's Northeast. This should be among the classics of wildlife documentaries, certainly of owl documentaries. It is truly a wonder."
5,excellent,Great read. Colorful descriptions and engaging prose. Well written and easy to follow. Brings the Old Louisville neighborhood to life.
5,A Spine-Tingling Stroll Through Old Louisville,"Ghosts of Old Louisville is an excellent book from an author who has a highly entertaining writing style. Full of history and paranormal tales.Rose PresseyAuthor of ""My Haunted Family"""
5,LOCAL BESTSELLER CATCHES SPIRIT OF LARGEST VICTORIAN NEIGHBORHOOD IN COUNTRY,"I'm so glad David Domine spent time writing down the wonderful stories and historical legends associated with America's Largest Victorian Neighborhood. I read it is now a regional best seller, and it does not suprirse me at all. His language is colorful, engaging and precise, not to mention extremely entertaining. His stories are informative, creative, and well thought out, not to mention hair raising. His book is, in short, WONDERFUL, and he has done our community and state a great service. I hope it entices others to come to Old Louisville, Kentucky, and explore this forgotten treasure."
5,Ghosts of Old Louisville - Great Storytelling,"I could not put this book down! Each chapter mixes a bit of storytelling with local history of Old Louisville in such a way that the reader feels they can see Old Louisville in its prime and experience the stories first hand. As I am driving through the area in the future, I will be looking over my shoulder and watching very carefully for the spirit of Jenny Bowman on Brook Street and Hattie Bishop Speed at the Speed Musuem. The book read so well that I can't wait for any future books the author might be planning. A must read!!"
1,Cheap,I was so excited to get this and then became extremely dissapointed. Very cheap!!! The prayer was all bent up and had creases on it. I guess from the packaging? The base was light cheap plastic. Not worth a dime.
2,Very Boring Start,"I have tried numerous times to read this book and every time I tried to read it the book was so boring that I fell asleep every time. They make it sound like a fabulous book but,I can't seem to get far enough into the book to find anything interesting. I know quite a bit about reincarnation because I am reincarnated. I remember my past life family and how many brothers or sisters I had. Like for instance now in the present I have two sisters and a brother with a very unloving family. In the past I had a mom and dad and just the one brother. I didn't have any sisters at all. Plus in that family my family loved me immensely. We all radiated love for one another. It was wonderful and magical. I keep holding onto this book hoping one day I will be able to get past the boring part and maybe just maybe it will become interesting to me."
3,Average at best,"NCAA football 2004 was one of the most anticipated games of 2003, however there's not a whole lot to get excited about with the newest version of the football franchise.The gameplay is almost identical to the 2003 edition and the dynasty mode is pretty much untouched. With lack of good sports titles available for the Gamecube, EA is the only company really that sports fans can turn to if you own the cube. If you have 2003's edition, there really is no reason to go out of your way to obtain the 2004 version. While there is some improvements, including fan reaction to the game, its really just 2003 with a new cover. A Rental at best."
5,EA dominates Sega in college football,If you liked the sega version of NCAA football rent EA sports NCAA 04 and I bet you throw the sega version away. THis realistic fast pace game is remarkable. I have played NCAA games since the first Bill Walsh college football game when I was in JR High and EA sports has continued to get better every year. If you want a College Football game this should be the only one to consider. 10 stars if I could give them.
5,NCAA football receives top reviews!,"Well I'd like to say that this is a great game to play. Whether your looking for a good game to compete against your friends or if your looking to play a dynasty, this is the game your looking for. To start out with, the graphics are great. I don't know how they got them better from last years title, but somehow they achieved perfection. With 2004, instead of the announcers saying the players number, you can type in their last name and the announcers will announce it. The dynasty mode is just flat out awesome. I like the recruiting system that they invented in last year's title, and in this game it is about the same. You can hire a new coach, and change around your playbook as much as you want.I honestly would pick this title over Madden any day. There's a lot more programs to do in this title and its a lot more competitive. If your looking for a fresh football game, I highly suggest NCAA Football 2004."
5,I LOVE NCAA FOOTBALL! GO HUSKIES! THIS GAME IS GREAT!,I really enjoy collage football. Great game for any sports fan. Really. You should get it!! 100 stars! Better than any NFL game!!GO AND ORDER IT!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Works great,"On a 90 Acura Legend, no problems including ""bedding-in"" process (10-50MPH, then really hard brakes down to ~10 again. Repeat 5-6 times. Should smell the brakes sorta burning, cool off drive). Expected Brembo to be top notch. So far so good."
