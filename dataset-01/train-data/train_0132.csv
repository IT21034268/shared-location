2,Why Maggie Gyllenhaal?,"This book is wonderful, but why did they choose this reader? She says her ""s""es like she is spitting into your ear. Or, like a snake. Very detracting from the actual book!"
3,Don't mind me...,"I'm just getting really sick of depressed ""genius""es. I know that perhaps when it was written this book had more pull, but right now the genius syndrome is just getting old. I don't mind characters with sad heads, but as long as they are presented in a new way. The way Esther is presented is ""oh, I'm so sad, but God I get a lot of awards and people really really like me, but oh no! and I'm the smartest person in this entire story and blah blah."" Trust me, I realize that this is extremely realistic and everyone gets sad, but I just wanted a little more from the writer-something jarring. But, I always expect too much. Still worth reading-obviously very influential."
4,good book,good book came in and i cant wait to read it. Dang i still have 5 words left. Benedict Cumberbatch.
5,incredible work,"I read the Bell Jar for my term paper in a literature class. i was literally blown away by Plath's work. she tells a story very similar to her own. i found many similarities between Esther and myself, excluding the depression. Esther was willing to break the mold, but she did not always realize it. i enjoyed this book so much and would recommend it to anyone, especially teenage girls like myself. i would also recommend her poetry. i have found that reading the poetry as well as the novel help to create a better understanding of Plath's life."
2,Surprisingly slow and a tad boring,"I love books about psychiatric hospitals or mental illness. Sadly, this book was very dry and just a very slow read. I found myself having to force myself through the book."
5,The Bell Jar,"Sylvia Plath is an amazing author. The fact that she relaesed such an intimate time in her life to be praised or ripped apart by critics shows she was not afraid. The Bell Jar is a well written, informative look into the mind of someone losing all sanity. In fact while you are reading it you will catch yourself questioning your own sanity!"
3,It's a classic,Edited to say: Sylvia Plath had a way with darkness and danger that no other poet has touched in the last decade. To heck with me if I didn't see than when I was 15.
4,Still relevant after all these years,"Sylvia Plath made a significant contribution to the understanding of mental health with the publication of this book in 1971. She describes the mental health care that was offered in the 50""s through her novel, The Bell Jar. It is widely acknowledged that this was more than a peak into her personal struggle, but a real reflection of how mental illness comes down on you, like a bell jar, where everything looks the same outside but there is pure confusion inside. This novel of such personal intensity explores the stages of the disease and the treatments that were available to her. It is far more in depth than Girl Interrupted. Both novels take on a difficult subject and give it the exposure it needs, which is what is really important. A poignant book worthy of continued success."
3,The Bell jar the bell jar the bell jar,"Book was decent at best. I just wish the author would've taken some time out to grab a THESAURUS every now & then. One can not possibly love the words ""queer"" & ""smudge"" that much."
4,"""The Bell Jar"" by Sylvia Plath","I would like to start off by saying that ""The Bell Jar"" by Sylvia Plath is a very interesting, creative, humorous, and splendid book. It gets off to a slow start but, its gets a lot better! It can be confusing at some points because it goes into flashbacks many, many times. Also, the vocabulary of the narrator can be confusing too. It is mainly told in first person. The main characters name is Esther. She goes through many struggles including love, trying to fit in, mental illness, and depression. I would say that the reading level is high school, college, and up.Once you start reading it, you can not stop!"
4,Terrifyingly Realistic In It's Depiction Of Insanity,"As a sufferer from depression,I could relate strongly to the themes explored in the book,particuarly Esther's attempts at trying to find something more and in so doing composes her symphony of madness that I will never forget.I remember, instead of going back to grammar school I went to a technical college which involved a totally different scenario and very nearly drove me to suicide.I remember the self loathing and my self-imprisonment in my home and the boredom and sense of failure that consumed me.Plath depicts depression as something that you can't ""snap out of"" something which alienates and confuses the individual.My only qualm about the novel was that she didn't really touch on these areas of self-loathing and paranoia that I suffered which meant that I was alone but all mental illness is indigenous and I have this book to remind me of that.John Mc Kenna"
3,Confusing...,"I was assigned to read this book for an English oral book report; but what am I supposed to talk about when it's so hard to follow along on what's going on? I didn't even notice when the mental breakdown occured, because she jumped around a lot, and it became too confusing to follow along."
5,Haunting,"I first read The Bell Jar as a teenager and I think I missed the point a bit. Like many of the reviewers who have given it a low rating, I found Esther's character difficult to relate to and I found the plot slow and slightly tedious. However, I re-read it recently and I was blown away. Perhaps because some of my close family members have recently been through very bad bouts of depression, I found that this novel resonated on a very personal level. Plath captures the awful claustrophobia of depression perfectly, and it is made all the more sadder with the realisation that she committed suicide soon after completing the novel. Maybe a lot of people will only find the true beauty in this book when they, or someone close to them, have experienced the all-consuming despair and lethargy of going through a similarly dark period. This book has definitely been promoted to one of my favourites and I am so glad I gave it another try."
5,I need to recommend this to Everyone!,"This was beautifully written. The way Plath flexes the words to describe the smallest emotional experience is so right on the money, it felt like Ester's experiences were mine own. I just finished The Graduate, and found the depression and weakness of the main character disgusting and pathetic. After reading/listening to Maggie Gyllenhaal bring this book to life, the disgusting depression that The Graduate presented was clearly a failed attempt to make the transition from college to real life and the depression that can come with it tangible for the reader. I wish Sylvia Plath had written more. I love her style, the elegant transitions, and the honey she offers to pull you in. OH and Gyllenhaal's performance is A+ work. Her voice was very easy to follow, her cadence was perfect and the way she took on the character made me feel like I was living the whole thing. LOVED IT it is like a great movie...only longer! Maybe I'll listen again!"
3,Started out great,"I thought the beginning was excellent; I really liked the first paragraph. Very tight writing, but then it started to falter. I know it's due to the emotional unraveling of Esther, but it just fell apart for me. Still worth reading."
2,Ugh,"I read this book in highschool and it nearly ruined modern fiction for me. I'm older now, have a masters degree in English, and I still find this book a boring, uninteresting, waste of time. To me Plath tries too hard to come across broken and tragic in her writing. Why do so many people think that a character's descent into madness makes for good reading? Wally Lamb's She's Come Undone is equally a waste of time in this regard."
1,Depressing,"The Bell Jar is a story of a teenage girl, Ester Greenwood, who dives deeper and deeper into depression, rejection & suicidal thoughts. The novel starts out with Ester's internship in NYC for a magazine, all seems normal. However, when Ester returns home she is on a downward spiral, eventually going through with her suicide thoughts and ending up in an instutition.Not having suffered from depression and self-esteem issues, it was hard for me to relate to Ester and her troubles.The Bell Jar is a a very sad tale of depression, thoughts of suicide, belonging and self-worth."
2,For girls,"The same way that ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is centered around a boy. ""The Bell Jar"" is centered around a girl in the 1960s.From a guys point of view this book is boring.It's about these lame dinners and the girl getting sick, and her pre-occupied thoughts about some dude.This book is outdated and just plain boring. I would not recommend it."
5,"An innocent is corrupted and almost destroyed by ""culture"".","Sylvia Plath's enlightening novel ""the Bell Jar"" is the story of a young girl who win the chance of a lifetime and becomes part of New York society. She comes to New York an innocent, striaght from a womans College, and instilled with all of the confines of a wealthy East-coast life. Once she is set free, however, she begins to make choices which bring her life around in a whole different direction. At the end of the summer, when she is thrown back into her dated and lacking society, she suffers a breakdown of mind and spirit, which leave her scarred for life. This story is wonderful not only in it's structure, but in the epathy that Plath causes the reader to have for the girl-woman Ester, but is also a brillent insight into the mind of Plath herself."
4,A confused journey,This book really takes you along with this tortured soul's journey into madness. I was amazed at how my own mind fell into the same confused patterns of the main character. A testement to the outstanding writing skill of the author. I think the experience is enhanced by researching and understanding a little about Plath before reading the book.
1,What is all the fuss about?,For most of my adult life (I am 49) people who get to know me tell me that I would absolutely love this book. I finally got round to reading it recently. What a disappointment. What is it all about? She repeats herself several times and I don't understand what it means at all. Shame.
4,i need help,Starter Question #1This book is in part based on Sylvia Plath's real experiences after graduating from high school and in college. Where can you see the fictional elements creeping in? How has she altered her history to create a compelling story?
3,Dated,"While ""The Bell Jar"" is well-written its portrayal of psychiatric care is rather out-dated. Stays in hospitals are often reduced to a few weeks or even days by insurance companies. Electroshock therapy is not as commonly used as a ""cure.""Other than that, I thought this was a good book, though a bit tedious at times."
2,Sylvia Plath Passes the Buck,"Considering its publication date, The Bell Jar's autobiographical tale of Sylvia Plath's descent into depression and insanity is an important book. However, the insinuations contained in it are disturbing. The Bell Jar seems to villify men in general for their lack of understanding. Rather than acknowledge that some people in general are distant, Plath turns men into whipping posts. It should be obvious to the unbiased reader, however, that Plath was just plain old insane. This reviewer feels bad for Ted Hughes, Plath's husband who has been blamed by two generations of literary feminists for Plath's suicide. Reading The Bell Jar should exonerate Hughes-- his wife was, unfortunately, mentally ill independent of his actions. Sylvia Plath should have taken responsibility for her own actions and her own condition."
4,A Review of The Bell Jar,"The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath was written in a modern contemporary setting. The novel is based upon a young girl who slowly descends into a deep depression. The world around her affects her living style causing her to not be able to function normally. She begins having trouble eating and sleeping. Throughout the book, she begins to have thougts of suicide, and soon after many attempts at it. After an incident where she disappears for a week, she checks into several mental institutions. Toward the end of the book, the author begins to forshadow her condition worsening and creating a more devastating disaster. It is believed that most of the book was based on the authors own life. Soon after the book was published, the author committed suicide herself. The novel was often times confusing but shed light on many unknown aspects. The reader is taken on a journey of drastic emotions. This book is mainly targeted for high school students."
4,Not a Salinger clone.,"Robert Taubman of the New Statesman mistakenly said ""The Bell Jar"" was ""the first feminine novel in a Salinger mood"". On reading the books first third you'll find yourself agreeing. Plath takes us down a path, seeming to say, ""Look ahead. This will lead us to the end."" Then we're repeatedly taken off of that path, down apparent detours without meaning or relevance. This is a deception.By the time you reach the halfway point you'll see that what seems to be important is only a grounding place for what surrounds it. What seems to be rambling is actually what is important. Eventually we abandon the original path completely, and find that all of those supposed meaningless detours were the true path all along, that the story's real importance lies within them."
4,Very interesting novel,"The Bell Jar was a novel of which was unusual than anything that I have ever read. It was easy reading, but it has so many different aspects to it. Esther's life takes a very drastic turn- she goes from living a lavish life in New York City, and then in a instant she has this mental illness which takes over her life. I just thought this novel was well-written, very emotional, and it's an interesting topic to write about. Not many people are comfortable with discussing mental illness. I truly recommend this novel as it will provide with a new meaning towards life and how one lives with a mental illness."
5,The Bell Jar,"I read The Bell Jar and was amazed. The main character, Esther, was relatable. Of course one must overlook the setting and date. I was blown away by Sylvia Plath's ability to describe the intense emotions that she'd gone through. For one such as myself, who had never come in contact with a person with these issues, I was stunned to, on a certain level, feel I could relate to them. The further you got into the book, the more legitimate you found her ideas. By the time I'd finished, I found myself questioning why she was institutionalized. Plath's ability to make me feel this way truely shows how great a writer she was. I would recommend this to someone in a second, and often have. It is a truely remarkable book."
3,OK,"It was interesting and sad. I was expecting better becase I had heard so much about it. I loved all of Sylvia's metaphors and similes, the book is very well written, but it left me looking for more, for some kind of resolution."
4,Very good,"A portrait of madness written with a light touch. Breathtaking, sad and timeless. A must read for lovers of personal literature of the 20th century."
5,Bell Jar,"Reading the Bell Jar I got pulled into Esters world. Sylvia Plath pulls you into the world of a young woman and her slip into depression. In the first couple pages she speaks about seeing a cadaver for the first time, and that is just enough to tweek your intrest. The way she speaks about some things can make you either bond with her or think she is compleatly insane.When I read this book i couldnt put it down and once i finished it stayed in my brain for days. This is possibly one of my favorite books that I've read in a long time and would highly recommend reading it."
5,Amazing Piece of Literature,"Sylvia Plath was one of the greatest writers to live, in my opinon. And The Bell Jar captures her disturbing brilliance perfectly. I found myself having several things in common with Esther, leading me to question my own sanity. But nonetheless, this book is amazing. Read it and you will not be sorry."
5,A Glimpse Of A Mind,"Bell Jar underscores the fact that some of us, regardless of intellectual, financial, or social status, simply cannot find our own link to life. This inner inability to connect with the world manifests itself as disenchantment. It may ultimately result in depression, addiction and untimely death, self-induced or otherwise. Although categorized as fiction, this book provides excellent insight into a recurring problem in our society."
4,Are you living in a bell jar?,"This is an easy book to read, however, it can be very confusing when Esther becomes completely insane. This is the reason I give The Bell Jar only a 4 star rating. While reading this book, one questions whether or not Esther is truly insane. I began to rationalize her thoughts and was pulled into her world. Are you living in a bell jar?"
5,The first Sci-Fi book I ever remember reading!,"""The Spaceship Under the Apple Tree"" was the first Sci-Fi book I ever remember reading. I was probably about eight years old at the time, and have been a fan of Sci-Fi ever since. I truly believe that it was this book that sparked my interest in Sci-Fi. I don't remember much about the story now, but I remember REALLY liking it."
5,Memories of long ago,My fifth grade teacher read this book to our class way back in 1953. We were all mesmerized by it. I'd love to see it reprinted and back in circulation. Great story.
5,I'll echo the call,"I loved these books as a kid, and as a 40+ year old adult would love to get a new copy. Please reprint these books!!!"
1,"This is an interview CD, no ,music","Not bad for what it is, but too many reviews here have been misleading. It's a typical interview CD. The band gets interviewed over breakfast while on tour in Australia. Yawn. Save you money."
1,Not worth it,This is Offspring's worst cd. There is no music! Its just a recorded interview. I love the Offspring and I hate to dis them but this cd is totally stupid.
2,There Is NO music on this CD,I do not know what the guy that gave this 5 stars is talking about.Obvoiusly he did not really buy this CD.There is NO music on it.End of story.That is it.NO music.The CD does not even get all the words they say.When you buy a CD you want No sound mistakes.This CD has a few of them.Only Buy this if you are a Die-Hard Offspring fan like me.Otherwise stear Clear.(Keep in mind The Offspring did not really put this out.It was that company.Not even Sony or Nitro.So don't blame them)
1,Boring and stupid,"Don't buy the cd! The guy that gave it 5 stars doesn't know what he's talking about. I also believe that the guy gave it 5 stars TWICE. If you do want a good offspring cd, go with SMASH, Offsprings best. I think you should get ""out of Conversation"""
1,The dumbest Offspring product in the world!,"I hate this!There is no music at all.Its just a boring interview cd.Its just an interview you listein to!I bought it because it was a bargain,I thought it would be worth it...But no!It ...Do not buy it."
4,Great! But only 37 minutes of music?,"Yes, this is a fine recording. But any CD only 37 minutes long does not deserve five stars."
2,Dissapointing,"I'd read so much about the ""Electric Ballroom"" gig before I ever heard it that I was very excited when I finally got this CD and popped it in my stereo. I wanted to hear what was it that made this gig really famous. I couldn't really hear anything at all, as it turns out. Seriously, I've heard 4th generation bootlegs that sound better than this, and I can't help asking myself ""Why did they bother?"". Not to rip on Wire or the individual members, mind you, as they are, quite simply, one the best bands that ever existed. This particular album, however, is for completists and/or masochists only."
2,Not recommendable,"Though I appreciate all of Wire's studio-albums from the late 70's to the early 90's, I never liked their live-performances. This is because they often turned their great pop-songs into a dissonant, chaotic goulash of sound. This CD-compilation, recorded at three various locations, Notre Dome Hall, Montreux and Electric Ballroom, is completely unlistenable for ""normal"" people. If any unknown band had served this, nobody would have noticed, but here the critics said:""Oh Wire, this is fabulous art-school-punk!"" You may call the performances on this album ""experimental"", but I really don't know why this gig made such waves. I only give two points, because there are two good studio-recordings thrown in at the end, they're called ""Our swimmer"" and ""Midnight Bahnhof Cafe"". But they're not worth buying this album."
4,Baltimore Sun,"James H.Bready,Baltimore Sun,January 20,2002:""""profiles {of}half a dozen Britons and Americans of varied backgrounds...He leads off with George William Brown, who sought the middle ground in collisions such as the Civil War (he was mayor of Baltimore) and coeducation at Johns Hopkins (he was a founding trustee). The thanks given Brown included residence in several jails, and, latterly, oblivion; but, amid Liebmann's patient scholarship, he's interesting."""
1,Worst Movie of All Time,This is the worst movie of all time. It's not campy. It is just two hour of your life that you wish you could get back. Avoid this dog at all costs.
2,Very Poor Picture and Sound -- DVD Version Would Suffice,"Perhaps this is the best that can be done transferring an old video production to Blu-ray, but the picture and sound quality are no better than can be achieved in a transfer to DVD. The sound is harsh, the picture, while not noisy nor marred by digital artifacts, is soft and the colors are murky. And it's presented in its original, made-for-TV, 1.33:1 (""full-screen"") aspect ratio. If you want a copy of this so-so movie, save some money, buy the DVD."
3,Champion of The Poor Cries Out in Anger,"This is the perfect gift for that brilliant English Professor with a special interest in long suffering American blue collar factory workers. Where are these workers? In China? About 42 years ago in 1970, I tired of this type of beseeching readers to gasp someone's self-appointed superior understanding of the downtrodden. In America, the downtrodden with enough talent to compete will find ways to better themselves. Some remain downtrodden because they did not inherit the talent needed. Since the author is an excellent writer, I wish he would take a new direction (if he has not done so already)."
3,"On Southern Lord, so how bad could it be?","Slow and sludgey doom, but when they speed it up, it sounds like a cheap Carnivore (another NY band) but with crappier vocals. It's worth a listen but there is plenty of stuff I'd buy before this. Buy it on vinyl if you're even going to bother. Not terrible, but definitely not great. Three stars is on the mark."
2,Not so much story here,"We bought this because our boy has two moms (he also has a grey cat named Emma, which could be a little confusing) and because the illustrations looked good. They are good, but we find the story lacking. So we make up our own to go with what's happening on the beautifully illustrated pages."
5,One of our favorites.,"Our son has loved this story for a couple of years now. We too have a cat that gets picked up and dressed up and would be painted, if said son had the paints without supervision.Even though we live in a very accepting city and he goes to a very open pre-school, we are finding that there are few story books with alternative families. This one works really well because the parents just happen to be Moms. There is nothing preachy or long-winded about it - it's just a sweet story about a little girl and her family.We really hope there will be more like this one..."
3,Not the most popular book on our shelf,If you already own Heather Has Two Mommies and And Tango Makes Three then this might be a good addition to your bookcase. We own all three and this gets the least requests.
3,two mom family with a very intelligent 2 year old,"this book is a little too simple for our boy but he does enjoy seeing a family like his in the pages and it has teh added bonus of teaching him about benig nice to the cat. But the overall writing and illustrations, I feel, are not high quality."
3,Cute illustration - simple read,I bought this for our son soon to be born. I think he'll enjoy it early in life - the story is really simple and rhymes. Cute pictures - colorful.
2,Clunky.,"I bought this book for my son, who has two moms. While he likes it despite its faults, I find the verse too clunky and don't like the way the author beats you over the head with the two moms thing. I prefer books where two moms are just part of the story and not so explicitly explained. (Other books don't start out with, ""Jason has a mommy and a daddy. Here they are--one mommy and one daddy. That makes two parents, one mommy, and one daddy."" I don't need a lesbian version of that.)"
2,my review of understanding horse behavior,This book is very short and so is this review. I would only say that this book is good if you are a novice when it comes to horses. Anyone with experience would find this repetetive and boring. The book only covers very basic points about horses. The book also does not give details about anything- it's more of an outline. I would close by saying that this book is probably one to steer away from.
1,This Guide is Outdated,We recently returned from Chile and found this guide to be almost useless when it came to reccommending restaurants and hotels. About half of those listed were no longer in business. This book should not be sold until it gets updated
4,Al Green Geatest Hits,I realy liked it. I had owned it before and I liked it enough to order i again. It is very inspirational CD.
2,Beware!,"I'm a great fan of Guiomar Novaes and think she's not known and appreciated as she ought to be. Also, the playing on these discs is wonderful. So why do I give it only two stars? The SOUND! The selections from the Town Hall recital are all from deteriorated acetate discs, and the sound quality ranges from bad to gawdawful, which means all of one disc and part of another. The record company is kind enough to warn you about this on the cover, but I figure that Amazon customers need a similar warning. So I don't recommend this unless you absolutely have to have everything ever recorded by Novaes."
3,Great Playing - Aweful Sound,"I have to concur with the other reviewer - The sound is horrible. However, Novaes is on fire in her Town Hall performance. If you can get past the admittedly horrific sound there is an energy that can come only from a live performance. Novaes will have you on the edge of your seat. I'll give it three stars and argue that if you are a Novaes fan this recording is worth having."
5,Music for Melancholy Moods,"I bought this album in 1984 when it first came out and listened to it while laying down on my bed. It made me feel sad, bringing me closer to my true emotional self. It made me pay more attention to the fine details. I listened intensely and felt overwhelmed. I fell asleep. This album is intense in how it will affect you, even though the music is sparse and minimalistic. If you think walking alone in San Francisco when the fog is rolling in is a good time, then this album is for you. It will surround you as you begin to notice fine details, to hear the wind in the trees and the sound of the rain just beginning to fall."
5,Beautiful shimmery music--a Pearl indeed,"I love Brian Eno and Harold Budd's music. The drifting effect of ambient music is soothing yet interesting to the ear and it really does create an atmosphere in the space in which you are playing it.The Pearl is mostly ""treated piano"" (gosh, as a lifelong player, I sometimes shudder at what they do to my favorite instrument, but it sounds divine.) Even though there is less of the electronic spacey effect, these pieces create an incredible sense of mood and emotion. ""Late October"" really has the feel of the regret of late autumn, when cold winter is on the way and only a ghost of happy times in summer and a glorious fall remain in a russet-colored landscape. ""An Echo of Night"" is mysterious and dreamy.Though the Ambient 1-4 were my favorite albums by Eno and Budd, Pearl is pushing its way right up there for ""most listened-to."" If you are a fan, I'd say this is one that you have to have. I just love it."
5,The Precious Pearl,"I have several other Brian Eno albums, and this one fits right in with the rest. It is a beauty to behold. It is really relaxing and conjures imagery in your mind's eye. It tells a story, and you can tag along to see the story unfold. What you perceive is largely determined by your mindset at the time when you listen to it. If you are stressed out, it most certainly will calm you down. If you are already calm, you may reach a meditative state. This music is probably best listened to with headphones while lying down in the dark, when you don't have anything on your agenda for the rest of the day. Play it in the day and it might make you sleepy, which you might want to avoid if you have things to do. It's gentle, yet powerful. You're going to feel something pleasant from it, for sure."
4,Lost in time,"I saw these guys in Santa Monica in '72. They were brilliant. But they had the misfortune of following Loggins & Messina in their first big gig. The crowd wanted to rock but Mark Almond was all about the dark and the cerebral. At one point, Jon Mark said with maximum sarcasm, ""If you're here to see the Allman Bros, they're playing down the street.""This album is their masterpiece. Impossibly laid back, it weaves its tale of Bay area angst and ennui with the most marvelous unhurried sense of timing. Eloquently balancing Mark's classical guitar and wistful voice with Almond's tenor sax, the listener is plunged into the self-absorbed sense of lostness that was so commonplace in the early '70s. It's not exactly jazz but it will do."
3,A Mystery in the telling ...,"While I consider this a remarkable story filled with rich details, I detected a significant journalistic gap and bias on the part of the author that I find mysterious. I sure don't buy, for example, that Ponzi was as benign or well-intentioned a character as the author made him out to be. Charismatic, strategic and highly skilled, absolutely. But Ponze was also very deviant and that didn't arise accidentally. He'd been a criminal and served hard time and about that experience we learned next to nothing or IMO it was glossed over. Hard time is not and never has been a church picnic, not in a penitentiary during the early part of last century for certain. Some details from what he was likely exposed to inside would have helped fill in these gaps for me. Some additional comments from creditors who got stung would have been interesting to include, too, but it all wraps up very quickly in the end. A little too quick for my interests."
5,Surprising after Skepticism,"I didn't think it was going to be this good.Zuckoff paints a brilliant picture of the life of Ponzi the man who came up with one of the first and most incredible pyramid schemes in history.The book of course is a tragedy. Ponzi made some people a lot of money, caused a lot of people to lose money and went from great wealth to poverty in rollercoaster ride time.The book is a fascinating study for those interested in business, persuasion and a great reminder that what sounds too good to be true, probably is.Ponzi is painted as having been a complex character that knew what he was doing...knew it was wrong...knew it would ultimately collapse, but was not without heart and caring for some.A truly well written and page turner of a book.Kevin HoganAuthor of The Psychology of Persuasion, and, The Science of Influence"
2,My review of Ponzi's Scheme,"This book is about the man whose con-game in the summer/fall of 1920 eventually entered into the English language. The book is basicaly a biography of Ponzi, with the majority of it focused on Ponzi's racketand eventual exposure.But there is much that this book does not even bother to look at.For example Ponzi is exposed as a con man in the fall of 1920, yetthere is no attempt on the part of the author to place the Boston Post's concerns about Ponzi in the context of the prevailing social darwinism of the time.Namely a belief that immigrants such as Ponzi could only succeed if they were crooks.The book does not explore what caused Barron to come out against Ponzi after having defended him.Nor is there any attempt to explore Ponzi' s political views, if any as Ponzi did have a patronage position in Mussolini's regime.What saves this book from being a 1 star book, in my view is that it is such an enteraining read."
2,Facts Without Color,"Our desire to get ahead financially is insatiable, especially in this capitalist society. A 50% return on my investment in 45 days? Where do I sign up? Too good to be true? Well, you know what they say... We think we are smarter, more sophisticated people today. Maybe so, but if we are, it's because we know about things like Ponzi schemes, or think we do.Mitchell Zuckoff provides the best detail yet, of the life and times of the man who gave his name to an illegal financial scheme, Charles Ponzi. The narrative is straightforward and factual. It's interesting, but a little dull. Charles Ponzi was a very charismatic man, very shrewd; think Donald Trump. This book provides many facts, but little in the way of emotional motivation.I recommend this book to everyone interested in human gullibility and the financial world. You won't learn a lot about either, but you'll have many facts about Charles Ponzi."
4,interesting story of an interesting man,"We've all heard of ""Ponzi Schemes"" but most people don't know the story behind them. This is that story. An Italian who game to the US via Canada and build a huge fortune based on postal coupons.To me, there was more to this story than just the ""ponzi scheme"" part. It's a story of a man who had a goal of how he wanted to live his life and went after that goal. And how he did it was very interesting. A few scams here and there, etc. The postal coupon was probably the most legitimate of his dealings, in my opinion.Good story. If you like the ""true crime"" genre, you will enjoy this one."
1,impossible to (...) any more than this,"If you are thinking of punishing your neighbors you should buy this album and play this at full volume. Actually, the same goes if you are looking to punish yourself. Ridiculous music by ridiculous people. Save your money."
5,I have had Dr. Goldstein for this class...,"Even though I am an Architectural Studies at Pitt, I nevertheless found myself in Dr. Goldstein's Sensation and Perception class this summer. I think the book is excellent and truly conveys Dr. Goldstein's personality. He is a fun guy, and an expert on the subject. He shares many of his ""tips"" for understanding sensation and perception to those of you who aren't fortunate enough to hear him lecture.Very well-written in REAL language, great diagrams...."
2,good info; bad presentation,"Make no mistake; the author is clearly a smart man who knows what he is talking about. Unfortunately, this book does a horrible job with the overall presentation, making it difficult to understand. I have had several textbooks throughout college and I find this to be one of the most boring textbooks I have ever encountered. I only wish that the author would bring this book to someone to fix out the format and layout in order to make it a more interesting, understandable read. All textbooks give over tons of information; pick one that is not so incredibly boring."
1,You MUST be joking,"Okay, you saw the picture. This poor betta has no space what-so-ever to swim. I keep my betta is a heated, underground filtrated 8 gallon hex. I think this tank is ridiculous. Bettas are tropical fish, and need a heated tank. You couldn't fit a heater in this 'tank' if you tried, and let alone fit a betta in here. Also, in a small tank bacteria will build up quickly and its excrements will dissolve and break down into nitrogen, and in this small tank, it will add up quickly, and soon your betta will be belly-up. I cannot emphasize enough about what a rip off this tank is. Trust me, use you 5 dollars wisely, and save them for a better tank. Your betta will thank you."
1,.....,"All I have to say is, if you are heartless enough to consider keeping a betta in this, save yourself the shipping and handling and put it in a 2liter soda bottle. I'm sure it would have more space to swim in that than in this."
1,WoW!,"I am actually glad to see there are this many people against this aweful sham of a betta ""home"". This is just plain outrageous. Sure a betta CAN survive in something this small, but a human CAN survive living in a closet. Would you want to though? Well neither does your betta!And the Silica gravel stuff at the bottom...wow, just, wow...they print ""Do Not Eat"" on the little packages of Silica for a reason! (you know the ones they put in new shoes to absorb moisture) It amazes me that some people think thats safe to put in with a LIVE ANIMAL!!!"
1,Cruel. Plain and simple.,"Tanks like this for bettas should be made illegal. I can't believe that anyone even thinks a 'tank' like this is a good idea. I have 2 bettas, one male and one female. They are some of the most intelligent, affectionate fish I have, and I can't imagine ever subjecting them to living in a tank like this. I guess Mark Twain was right; humans truly are 'the lowest animal.'"
1,Worst tank for bettas!,Don't buy this tank! I bought one and it was small. It also LEAKED and almost killed my fish. Luckily I put water back in it and the fish survived for now and I'm awaiting for them to fully recover. This is the most horrible design of a tank and needs to be recalled and fixed. The water stopper at the bottom can get a miniature fracture in it that you cant see because the whole stopper is black and can start leaking water overnight. My heart almost stopped to see the fishies trying to survive on the bottom of the tank. I would stay away from this tank as you can see from all the reviews.
1,How to make this serial even better...,"Mmmkay, so the Serial Squadron took a rotten serial, truncated it, added color effects, and further monkeyed with it to make it ""better"". Uh-huh. So here's my advice, serial fans: don't buy it at all, the ULTIMATE truncation. Now, you've not only made the serial 'better' but you've just saved fifteen bucks.The Serial Squadron is capable of outstanding work (see their GANG BUSTERS for example) but this is their work at its worse. Over at www.inthebalcony.com we're making this our Worst DVD Release of the Month."
3,pre runner to series lost,"now that i've seen it all, you want more mystery , but its over, i think the serial,i was remembering was the sea hound, but i enjoyed this one ancient aircraft , subterrian tunnell &bases the comic sidekicks"
4,A great breadth of brilliant writing,"Wallace's breadth of effective writing is staggering. He paints from the endlessly complex to the economically subtle. His only crime that wages through several of the stories in this collection is the occasional detour into self-indulgence, but even this is pulled of with a sense of humor."
3,Overrated,The stories were good enough for me to finish the book -- I think there are much better story writers than Wallace. I don't get all the hype over this guy's writing.
4,A Fast Foster,"An amazingly fast read for David Foster Wallace, this book's title story was my favorite. That is not to say, however, that the other stories were not worthy of their own unique merit, amusing and exactly what you would come to expect from DFW."
3,"Funny, clever, but not as great as other DFW.","This book was simply not as good as other David Foster Wallace writings I've read. However, it is probably the funniest, and possibly the most absurd plot-wise of his I've read. The first story was probably the funniest and the last (novella length) story, ""Westward the Course of Empire Takes its Way,"" was probably my favorite, in which he trashes postmodernism in oft-clever and funny ways. There's no footnotes/endnotes in this story collection which is a common element in his other writings and which I find to be one of my favorite things about his writing. I can't pinpoint all the things that make me feel this collection is inadequate, I think it's just not as good is plenty sufficient though. So overall, not as great as I'd expect from David Foster Wallace and definitely not a good place to start for new readers of Wallace."
4,another great fusion of ideas despite some of DFW's oddities,"DFW is obviously brilliant. The last story had me in rapture, the story about David Letterman was perfectly written, and the first story left long lasting traces on me. That being said, DFW has no idea how to end a story and often, doesn't know when to stop writing. But his characters are memorable and he knows how to change voices with the best of them. Damn shame to lose a great writer."
2,"There's homage to Pynchon, and then there's aping Pynchon","Reading this collection brought to mind a review I once read of a film, a paraphrasing of which best sums up this work: this is such a close copy of Thomas Pynchon that it's not plagarism, it's quotation. The extended fugue on Jack Lord and ""Hawaii Five-O"" in the last story (""Westward..."") could've been lifted directly from ""Vineland"". Overall, the world-weary hipness and extended verbal (literal?) arabesques wore me out. At least Pynchon was genuinely funny, at intervals."
3,Intriguing yet absurd,"Flashes of brilliance with complete and utter beauty. However, it is obvious the author is still searching his method. Some stories are just dead and strange. The author at his best is far more unsettling and unblinkingly addictive than Vonnegut. Other stories... are just not as they could be, and disappoint. I can only hope that David Wallace can pull his talent together continuously through a full book, and soon."
4,Is it intimate and lovely? Yes it is. But...,"...I wouldn't be telling the truth if I said I liked it as much as I liked:- various Mingus grops (both from studios and concert halls)- piano albums made by my favorite pianists (Th. Monk, D. Ellington, C. Basie, T. Wilson,O, Peterson...) and some other pianists I also like (B. Evans, T. Flannagan, A. Tatum, S. Price, j. Lewis, A. Jamal...).This solo piano album is lovely, intimate, imaginative and musical, but I believe the Mingus fans will profit most from it."
3,Not the equal,"It's an interesting album in many ways, but in the end Mingus' band albums are much more enduring. I know I'd always rather hear the ""Myself When I am Real"" on 'Let My Children Hear Music', much more effective with a larger band part of the action. As for Mingus technical skills as a solo pianist, he was OK, no better."
2,1999 or is it 2000,"The CD was ok but it was nothing spectacular. I would not recommend purchasing this CD, I was quite disappointed with it."
4,Natalia es la más normal,"Buenísima novela que trata principalmente de conflictos generacionales en la España de los 70. Natalia se auto-exilia durante 12 años, y vuelve a Barcelona a enfrentarse con un pasado lleno de sinsabores, el mayor de los cuales es la falta de comprensión que sufre por parte de su padre, que en realidad debería comprenderla a la perfección.La novela está dividida en seis partes, y a través de ellas se van descubriendo las vidas secretas de la familia Miralpeix: la tía Patricia bebe, quizás por despecho, quizás por coraje, Encarna la criada se resigna a un matrimonio de conveniencia, Lluis el hermano es distante y totalmente falto de compasión, Silvia y sus amigas de colegio de monjas (vaya escenita), y por supuesto Natalia, que intenta hacer las paces con un pasado doloroso. ¿Lo conseguirá?"
5,INCREDIBLE CD,"Words fail me to describe the gift of music that this CD gives me. It's a wonderful listen anytime - at work, at parties, with dates, or anytime I need to be blown away by the passionate, tender, and poetic power of guitar music, and the very best of Spanish classical guitar music at that. Parkening plays on this album as if he had a Latin soul. The actual selection of the pieces is very interesting too. I say this because sometimes other Spanish guitar CD's give in to boring selections mixed in with the great pieces, but all of these pieces on this CD are gorgeous. I LOVE THIS ALBUM and think you will too!"
2,bad clasp,"Bracelet looked great at first, and for the most part still does EXCEPT the clasp. The clasp has been changing color since about a month after I purchased it. Only worth buying if the price is low enough that you can pay a jeweler to change the clasp. Having the clasp change color makes the whole bracelet look fake."
5,Absolutely beautiful!,"I couldn't believe the price on this bracelet. I was worried it would be of inferior quality, but it wasn't. My fiance loves it! He's allergic to most metals with nickel in them, but this doesn't bother him at all. It is gorgeous too!! We plan on having it appraised at our local jeweler, so I will update this review then to reflect the outcome of the appraisal."
2,It really is kind of lame...,"Ok, I appreciate the positive reviewers' attempts to put a nice spin on this record, and I do think Wire was trying to do something good, and I do think there are isolated striking sounds and songs, but it really is a pretty lame record on the whole. I have nothing against electronic pop, but the songs are just not really interesting, and the overall feel is pretty silly. I disagree with the reviewer who suggested this compares favorably to New Order. Through the album Technique, New Order had much better, and much more emotionally evocative songs. Arguably, Manscape at times sounds a bit like New Order from the album Republic on, which is not a compliment. Again, I don't knock Wire for doing something completely different, but this really is not a good record."
1,Cripe,"I love just about everything this band ever did and all the side projects too, but this thing is an atrocity. I suspect that it's some kind of art prank on their part. ""What if we made an intentionally ... album. If nobody listened to it, would it still exist?"""
2,Nice try,"I guess they had to make an attempt at a polished, noise-free album, but it just doesn't work for me, try as I might. Although track 4, ""Other Moments"" ranks among their best (pulsing and hypnotic with a faraway guitar plea), most others struggle for any kind of personality in a sea of synth blandness. They still have the mastery of making great percussive noises with keyboard rhythms and pulses (as in many of Colin Newman's solo works) but they should have known better than to put WIRE on the cover. Disappointing from any angle, even with titles like ""Children of Groceries."""
4,"Fun, Fun, Fun Till Their Daddy Took Their T-Bird Away","This was Wire Train's last album, and it has a totally different vibe than their four previous efforts. I don't know if they knew, or at least suspected at the time, that this would be it, but it feels like they decided to go out having fun. The album has a very loose, relaxed, carefree vibe. The lyrics sound more spontaneous, the vocal harmonies are a little bit ragged, and all in all it sounds more ""live"". When I first bought the album in 1992, I was a bit put off by this, and it took me awhile to appreciate ""No Soul No Strain"", but now it's my second favorite Wire Train album, behind only 1990's eponymous set. Highlights include ""Stone Me"", ""Willing It To Be"", ""Higher"", ""Impossible"", and ""17 Spooks""."
4,Best of the Lost 90s,"This is an outstanding relic of the 90's that deserves a spot alongside Bash & Pop's ""Friday Night is Killing Me,"" and The Best Kissers in the World's ""Been There"" on the shelf of great lost rock of that decade. Decidedly more Lou Reedish, with heavy hints of The Edge, and plenny of what Big Star might have been, this album escaped their early pop misfires and delivered some topnotch grungy psycho-soul classics like the anthem-like ""Stone Me,"" the evocative ""Hey Jordan,"" the upbeat ""Higher,"" and the grunge-bouncy ""Impossible."" Once you overlook the unfortunate epithet, no one will need to understand why you'll like this record so much - it's that oddly personal to anyone who hears it."
5,Vintage,"This was the first of a string of brilliant and legendary records on Impulse by the great Coltrane quartet featuring new bassplayer Jimmy Garrison. Somehow everything fell into place at once - the music has a dark, blazing intensity that is instantly recognizable and far removed from the comparatively bright and colourful recordings of the previous Atlantic-years. The real heavy spirituality would not set in for another few years - but surely this music is highly spiritual in its own way, only in a more bluesy and human way than the quartet's later records. Vintage Coltrane!"
3,Didn't get the inside booklet.,"I already had a copy of this cd in a previous edition without the bonus tracks. I ordered this copy because I love Coltrane's music so much being a saxophonist myself. All the stars go to Trane but I'm only rating this 3 stars because this copy didn't carry the regular booklet inside with the liner notes and photographs. I received the item sometime in July but I just write now since I was distracted with my job and posponed doing so for ""later"". Is there any possibility of getting the booklet now?"
4,good music,"john coltrane was a musical genius, like thelonious monk and also Frank Zappa. Check out hot rats folks."
3,Subsided simmering,"3 1/2Although this disc can be a little tame compared to similar dated material, it is never dulled enough to loose interest in, and quite to the contrary filled with many sharp twists and surprises that showcase brilliant technique throughout even while the least challenging of melodies and interplay show this classic lineup just beginning to stretch."
4,Very good book for Hypnosis,Bill O'Hanlon is a great author! I love this book in a way it's like cliff notes for Ericksonian Style Hypnosis. Very good introduction. Very useable. Easy to read definitely recommend it to anyone.
4,Works Great!,The Stand Off Stabilizer is very sturdy and works very well. I have cathedral ceilings in my home and it has been a blessing for changing bulbs in my track lighting The only drawback is that it makes the ladder harder to move around and more difficult to store because the ladder doesn't fold as flat with the Stabilizer attached. I usually de-attach the Stabilizer before storing the ladder.
1,"Good music, but bad CD choice","For less than half the cost of this disc, you can get the EMI releaseJoplin: The Easy Winners & Other Rag-Time Music / Previn: A Different Kind of Bluesthat contains all of the music on this CD as well as Andre Previn's album ""A Different Kind of Blues""."
5,Wednesday was sick ..but the dvd is still sic!!,Great show...Wednesdays voice was a little off due to sickness but its still a great dvd and a great value. All graverobbers should own this!!!!!!!
1,It Doesnt work with DCR-DVD403,"WARNING: This battery doesnt work with the Sony DCR-DVD403. Maybe is not a Dekcell problem but a Sony problem (forcing to just use Sony products) but it doesnt work anyway. My camera give me the next info:Use the ""InfoLithium"" battery pack.and the camera turn off automatically.Hope it help u."
1,Did not work,I ordered this battery months ago and still can not get it to work. I did email the seller but did not get a response. This is the second battery I purchased for my Sony camcorder that did not work.
3,acceptable---nothing special,"I lived in DC for 21 years so I'm familiar with most of the entries in this book. The editor does a fair but not especially lively job of describing where to eat, drink, walk and gawk in DC."
5,"Even Better Than ""Waltz!""","I purchased the album ""Appalachia Journey"" because I liked the first one ""Appalachia Waltz"" so well. I made an excellent choice, for this is a very beautiful album. The song ""Hard Times Come Again No More"" is very good, and James Taylor does an exceelent job, as does Ms. Krauss. But the real accolades should go to the Meyer-O'Connor-Ma trio, for they are magnificent. They blend together as if they had been playing all their lives. This album is an excellent purchase to anyone who loves music."
5,A little gem.,"Signs of intelligent life on Earth; when I added this to my iTunes library I gave it my highest complement: ""Gemmy"". This lovely meditation on Appalachian themes by three fine string musicians has special guests James Taylor and Alison Krauss. I love this recording. This is the best of the fusion work from our great age. Elements of country and bluegrass. This is a treat. Good sonics."
3,So so,I totally respect YoYo Ma but this CD was a little disappointing because all the tunes were more like jaz and improv than nice tight blue grass and Appalachian fiddle tunes. One reel was nice but they all had a slow dirge quality that disappointed me.
1,Yawn!,"Having purchased other Yo-Yo Ma music and being a fan of Appalachian music I was excited to listen to this CD. Yawn! This Cd start off slowly, gets slower, and then by that point your so bored it doesn't matter. Will be returning this CD to Amazon for credit."
1,Seriously lacking feel,"Yo-Yo Ma tries but, at least in this recording, he fails to grasp the organic nature of the folk pieces he is playing. It's like a cliche academic study from a second rate movie--the notes are right, but the music is all wrong.I wanted to like it, but I don't."
4,You nearly hit the spot - keep the momentum,"Fisrtly, my friend Mo (yo mo its Usmana give me a call) introduced me to New Jack Swing whilst at Uni in the early 90's, since then you guys have got me out of bed, got me in to bed (wont go into that). There is no question that the production is there, no question the heart is there, but the focus has to be on what makes Guy as individuals works. Only Guy know this. But keep please keep the momentum, the world is a poorer place without Guy, with AH, D'CL'H and TR."
2,Not Again?,"I am disappointed in the albums nowadays that only have one or two cuts on them that are good and the rest are garbage. So when I heard that GUY was getting back together to do another album I was like hell yeah! But low and behold another disappointment. I just refused to believe that Teddy is losing his touch, but after listening to this and the last Blackstreet album it makes me wonder. I hate to second guess my boy Teddy, but I know this album could have, and should have been better."
2,Guy can do better than this!,"If I had to limit my review to one word, it would be disappointment. But since I can elaborate, I will. I waited 10 years for these guys to create magic again, and they didn't deliver. In my opinion, the best track on the whole CD is Dancin' -- and it's marginal at best. The rest of CD sounds like Blackstreet struggling to put out another attempt at success. The ballads don't even come close to being as good as Piece of My Love, Let's Chill, Goodbye Love or even some of the Blackstreet's ballads. Overall, I'm glad they got back together, but in the future I hope they can recapture the inspiration and magic they put into their first two albums -- when they were hungry for success."
4,"No stopping The Nasty Man, Teddy 'Jam' riley & Crazy Legs","As you can see there is a lot of mixed opinion about this CD. I feel that you can't go back to the old sound of NewJackSwing - No matter how much we want to. Guy III has followed the same format of the other Guy albumns but has different Flavas. This CD has tight production all over it - Teddy has tried not to take any risks with the albumn and so there will be hits coming, with different sounds. The CD has Guy written all over it and no other producer, and voices could match any of the three albumns. Advise: Don't compare it to the other Guy albums. Track four; Aaron is deadly. Await the 8min remixes!"
3,HMMM....,"Okay, its great to see them back, and yeah, I was with them from the start, Groove Me, etc etc etc. HOWEVER... I dont know if its the fact that I bought this CD at the same time I bought D'Angelo's new one (which is mindblowingly brilliant)...but.. the CD aint bad, but with all the progressive sounds hitting the airways these days, 'Neo Soul' movement, if you will, Timbaland, etc., this CD comes across as not very ground breaking. Theres some cute ballads, 'Not A Day' is brilliant, but the uptempo songs (beyond 'Dancin'') are pretty boring and not very different. This CD just sounds very dated, like if it was recorded as a followup to 'The Future' and sat on a shelf for 10 years.Maybe Im being over critical, but I just wasnt very impressed. This CD will probably sell mainly for nostaligic value, but, if it wasnt for that, Id probably be pretty indifferent about this project... and most of you guys who are being real with yourselves will probably agree."
2,Teddy Boy's Folly.,"Teddy, Teddy, Teddy....Guy's been too gone, too long. Listen, ""Guy#1"" with the introduction to New Jack Swing was groundbreaking. ""The Future"" marked independence from ownership and writing battles and was really, really great...the three Blackstreet albums were great, but this misses the mark a little bit...maybe we're ""new jack saturated"" or were expecting something a little more radical from ya...I dunno. That Roger/Zapp rip on ""Teddy's Jam III"" was bearing a little on the distasteful side to me....maybe you coulda waited longer to put this one out...it will probably go gold or platinum, but I, a long time fan, feel let down."
1,"These ""Guys"" must be imposters!","I had high expectations for this reunion and I must say that I haven't been this disappointed over a CD since Prince's "" Emancipation""! This one really broke my heart! Not one song got my attention and it was as mediocre as it can be! Aaron Hall and Teddy Riley were great with their solo projects after the group sadly broke up, but they got back together to make this drivel? I remember back in the day when my girls and I would go crazy whenever we heard "" Let's Chill""(a stone cold classic!), "" Teddy's Jam"", and ""Groove Me"". I just have to play those old gems while I wait patiently for their next project. BRING MY BOYS BACK PLEASE!"
3,TELLIN ME NO... OR NONE OF YO FRIEND'S BUSINESS!,"Okay, I already did a review.. Scroll down... (BTW, I burned 4 songs, and the video for 'Dancin' onto a recordable disc, and sold this badboy back)... and I dont mean to continue attacking them, but... Dayum... dont ""Tellin' Me No"" sound strangely like the bridge in Ginuwine's ""None Of Your Friend's Business""? (Hmmm Hmmm Dammn Hmmm)... the music, the vocals, the singing style... *shrugs* maybe its just me."
1,"weak ,weak ,weak","i have been a guy fan for the past 12 yrs,but this is just one of the greatest album disappointments i've had during this period. the ONLY song worth the original guy is ""dancing"" and that just barely passes pls don't buy this c.d if you're a true guy fan !"
2,10 Years & This is What We Get?,"Guess my title says it all. I actually took this back to the store - my first time ever doing that. I exchanged it for Donell Jones - A MUCH BETTER PICK! This stuff is pretty tired and seems a bit overproduced. Plus,....why aren't there any slow songs like before or that has Aaron the crooner producing? Isn't he the master of that genre and at least we could expect 1 cool slow groove from them. Buy it for nostalgia sake,...not for the tunes. I was really disappointed. If I had to stretch I would say that you could listen to the gospel inspired ""Someday"" until heaven exists on earth. Also ""Love Online"" showcases the 'you've got mail' craze of today with a good beat."
2,very average,Teddy is a musical Genius.AAron Hall can sing.and Damion? well he does something.this disc isn't hitting all the way it's supposed to be.i liked Dancin' and a few other tracks but it seems overly Produced.trying to appeal to much.it's better than much of BlackStreet but not by much when you consider you have Guy back.this disc would have been cool if it came out before Michael Jackson's Dangerous.but Teddy&MJ did New Jack Swing and that was the end of Guy.i liked dangerous I still do.but it and other things cost Guy.10 years for this isn't worth full price.they can do better.
3,GUY IS BACK!,"One of my favorite groups of all time, and definitely one of the most influetial would have to be GUY. Teddy, Aaron and Damien singlehandedly ressurected R&B and had Keith Sweat, New Edition and Al B Sure along for the ride during the New Jack Swing Era. Both of their previous albums were classics, however this album arrives in a much more competitive soundscape than the previous two. Artists like Sisquo and producers like Rodney Jerkins threaten to doom Guy into obscurity, but on cuts like ""Do It"" and ""Love Online"", Guy manages to maintain fresh originality. Ultimately the listening public will have to decide whether or not they are feeling Guy, but the album is really nothing revolutionary as a whole. For example, ""Teddy's Jam III"" while an obvious tribute to Roger Troutman, is just too much like ""Dance Floor"" to be considered original, like the previous two Teddy's Jams. But hey, I'm just looking forward to the show cuz guess what, GUY IS BACK!"
3,It's a'ight,"As a die-hard fan of GUY, I found this album to be somewhat lackluster. I own their first two albums, and this doesn't begin to compare to their once-distinct sound. There are a few songs that remind you of what they once were, but overall this album is disappointing. Also, the addition of the brother on some of the leads took away from the ""GUY"" sound. If you want it because it's GUY, go ahead, if you want your money's worth, skip this one."
3,Guy?,"I was so excited about the reunion of Guy, I had to go and purchase the album immediately. I had heard the cut Dancin' and just new this was the same ole Guy. After listening to the album I was slightly dissapointed. It seems to me Teddy is going through a phase were he's not sure what he wants to do with his music, which I noticed on the last Blackstreet album. Instead of doing what everybody else is doing. He needs to get back to funkin it up. The album goes from A to B and then to Z. As for the vocal talents of Aaron they were as splended as ever. Especially on the song, ""Why You Wanna Keep Me From My Baby"". Now don't get me wrong Teddy funks it up on a couple of tracks like, ""Teddy's Jam III"" and ""Do it"", but the album is not complete. Maybe the weak tracks just need some remixing. Teddy is famous for doing that."
1,Teddy what are you thinking about?,"This cd will waste your time and money. Something old, nothing new. Wish I'd borrowed, money blew. I'm sorry; when you have the talent and genius of Teddy Riley, you do not unleash this turkey on the public. Then again....knife and fork please!"
2,dissapointin,i dunno maybe teddy riley has run out of steam but when u listen to guys first album the songs are instantly catchy here nothing is really hey at least better than blackstreets last terrible album
5,A good comeback,"It's been a while, but Teddy, Aaron, and Damion proved that they could re-unite with their voices. I saw their video Dancin', and it is really good. Also Why You Wanna Keep Me From My Baby is a truthful video because it talks about a man not seeing his son (the woman ends up taking the boy away for no reason). Plus, the slow songs are beautiful and make you feel like you're with someone in a room. They were good back in the 80s, and they're good now. Oh, yeah. Don't forget about Teddy's Jam III--that joint is tight, ha ha."
4,buy it but don't expect too much!,"Had this been guy's first album i would've said that it's an excellent debut set. However, this is guy's third album and they've set very high standards, may be too high even for the creators of new jack swing to reach again. There are 4 or 5 excellent tracks but the rest makes you wonder if Teddy has lost the plot. ""Rescue me"" and ""why you wanna keep me from my baby"" are outstanding (Aaron's voice is awesome, R.Kelly step aside). Those two tracks along with the dance floor masterpiece ""dancin'""(thanks to Eddie F) hold the album together. ""Teddy's Jam III"" is a reminsce of the old guy. The presence of Blackstreet's Eric Williams and Terrell Philips on a couple of songs makes you think a new Blackstreet set is on the horizon. This is a good album and worth buying but not the great album you would expect from a great group, may be we'll have to wait for the remixes."
4,Maturity Is A Good Thing,"To all of you expecting the Guy of old you can forget it. For those of you looking for the Aaron Hall that has been missing since 1991, HE""S BACK! Aaron is an icon of R&B music, he changed the way many singers deliver thier vocals and on this album he is putting everyone in the industry to test. Teddy is Teddy, he is growing upand proving to the world that he can also make Power Ballads. This new Guy album is worth the wait. The background arrangements are wonderful and Damien came through and represented! It's not going to exceed the first album in 1988 but it's definitley a matured view of the thirtysomething crew. If you don't have it....go get it."
3,I think they have some talent but this release simply doesn't show that.,"*LOL* Sorry. It's just the truth.The intro was OK, but the next track We're Comin' is silly. Dancin' is solid R&B; though. Rescue Me is even better. Very sultry and sexy. Love the ""obscure"" and tip-toeing production. Probably the best track here. Do It is super-skip-able. Why You Wanna Keep Me From My Baby isn't too shabby.Cover Art: B+Music B-Lyrics: C-Production: C-Talent: B-Overall: C-3.2 stars."
4,Worth the wait it's shame it didn't sell,"Due to ego's, Guy waited ten years to release their thrid disc Guy III. The CD was a massive flop but it still featured some quality material. The first single Dancin was a mid-tempo number that showed of Aaron's vocals and Teddy's production skills while Teddy's Jam III was a instrumental jam easily on par with the first two parts. Of course my man Aaron Hall kils the slow jams in particular Rescue Me, Love On-Line, and Why U Wanna Keep Me From My Baby.Guy was always more than just an above-average soul group and with the right promotion, production and ego's being set aside I could eaisly see the group making a come back."
2,"No, No, No","I was completely disappointed with this release from Guy. After the trend they set with their first two albums, this doesn't even sound like something Teddy Riley would put together. Teddy was completely off the mark when he aimed for this one. I wouldn't recommend this release to today's R&B fan. If you buy this, it will only be one of those discs in your collection that take up space. The only song i really liked on here was Dancin'. Sorry, Teddy..........wrong formula!!!!!!!"
3,"Average, but don't expect much more....","When I first heard of Guy getting back together, I was like wow! That's great because I liked their previous offerings a lot. However, with this one... It's a mixed bag. I thought Fly away and Spend time were the best two songs on the CD. Dancin was ok, but it didn't have that GUY feel to it. Maybe I was just spoiled by ""The Future"" album. Which was 10 years ago! I guess a lot can change in 10 years, including your style. They pretty much keep to it, but the songs just don't have a lasting appeal like before. The CD is ok, but you'll get tired of it pretty quickly."
5,Beautiful Men's Bracelet,"I just received this Curb Link bracelet and I love it. The cost was phenomenal, the shipping was fast, and the packing was very articulate. Thanks for helping me with my Christmas Shopping."
2,Certainly not what I had expected,The music in this is SO fast you can hardly keep up with it. It's not at all what I had expected and if you are buying this for a child then keep in mind this has some fast lyrics that fly by so it's not meant for a younger kid. Seems much faster than in the movie. I may be wrong but this is merely my opinion. The artwork on the cover is nice....that may have been why I was more generous with the star rating. I wouldn't buy this if given another chance. It is NOT worth the money they are charging.
2,Not the Wizard of Oz MOVIE soundtrack lyrics,I didn't realize that when I bought this karaoke cd of the Wizard of Oz Broadway Musical it meant that the songs would be interspersed with dialogue from the show and extra song lyrics. What a major disappointment for us fans of the movie! It turned out to be a complete waste of money for us. :(
1,Look elsewhere,"1. Far too bright2. Two numbers became far too dim after a year3. With mine, when you set the alarm, the alarm starts going off. Only on the second or third time will it actually set the alarm.4. It has started just...not working. I set the alarm but it doesn't go off in the morning. I was too lazy to take it back when I originally got it, but now I have to buy a new one. Thanks, Emerson."
3,Unwanted personal bedside floodlight! AH!,"The alarm is Ok, and it looks great. The nap button is the best ever, however the buttons either don't work at times or certain alarms at times will just NOT turn off. I have eventually just had to unplug the thing. ALSO, the clock is soooo bright, even when dimmed that I have to turn it facing the wall so I can actually sleep. Maybe get the same version in red, it's not as bright."
2,Too Bright,"This clock is the brightest clock ever, even on the lowest setting. Do not buy uless you want a night light in your room. It kept my wife and I awake all night!"
1,I returned mine!,"I purchased this clock based on the features advertised & the sleek design, thinking it would be perfect. I was so wrong. I don't think the alarms worked properly because I overslept more than once in the short 5 days I owned it. The number display is entirely TOO bright, it lit up the room! The alarm set buttons on the side are quite small & hard to use. The one feature I liked is the radio on/off button, but that alone was not enough for me to keep this radio. A big disappointment!"
1,Completely Unreliable,"I do agree that this alarm clock has many features, like an AM/FM tuner, a double alarm, and a bright display.But it is very unreliable with its alarms. It did work fine in the 9 months I owned it; then things started to happen.Five months - The radio quality seem to drop A LOT! Many stations refused to come in, and it made it almost unusable.Six months - The bright display was much darker when I first bought it. I had a hard time reading the time due to this.Nine months (THE FINAL STRAW) - The alarm would not go off at some times. In a month, six alarms did not go off, and I was way behind my day. And to make matters worse, the alarm would go off at random times; in one time it went off at 1:00 AM, and that was awful.It has a few nice features, but it's not durable. Unrecommended."
1,least reliable clock ever,"the alarms just do not work on any regular basis, very unreliable and waste of money"
1,Very Bad!!,"This is the everything-gone-wrong clock! The number display is so bright that I have to turn it away from me while I sleep. The buttons and settings don't work very well. Also, the alarm hasn't been very dependable--it often goes off at random times in the night and fails to go off at the set time for morning."
3,Great clock if you need a night light as well!,This alarm clock is fine for most features and I bought it because the blue light was more pleasing than the usual red but the light is sooooo bright (even on it's lowest setting) that I have to put a black hankie over it so I can sleep at night. If you need a night light with your alarm clock this is the one - but if you're just looking for an alarm clock think twice.
3,Own your own Sun,"The Alarm function works great. Love the dual alarm. Love the auto set function even with daylight savings.But the brightness, my gosh.I think you can run a small country off this thing. Have had mine for quite a while and finally I just turn it face down at night. Otherwise you can read a book by the blasted thing."
5,intresting and adventurous story,It is a very interesting and adventurous film that would be good for all to see. I really enjoyed this film.
3,An Important Book,"...but, reproduction looks faded. It is hard to read some of the words. ""Introduction to Hawaiian Grammar"" by Dover is better as the print is origininal and clear. The text is identical to ""Synopsis""."
5,SUPERB,"Andreas Scholl, arguably, the finest countertenor singing today, has released this new, superb album. It consists of a collection of songs accompanied by lute put together by Robert Dowland, a minor composer (1591-1641) under the title A MUSCALL BANQUET (no, I didn't misspell it). It is a fine cross-section of songs in English, Spanish, Italian and French.Scholl has many ""hit"" CD's to his credit, including a beautiful collection of Vivaldi songs, an album called ""Heroes"" in which he sings some gorgeous Handel & Gluck opera arias and he is the male soloist on a new recording of Pergolisi's ""Stabat Mater."" His voice is absolutely pure and beautiful.Three fine musicians accompany him on lute, guitar, harpsichord. etc. Recommended."
2,Emitt early in his career,"I love Emitt, but this is before he really got into his groove with ""Mirror"" and ""Emitt Rhodes"" (both HIGHLY recommended).Emitt, we're waiting for your new LP, hopefully coming out soon. You're great!Tol"
4,"Ah, Emitt...","Ok. I have to admit up front that I haven't actually listened to this CD but, I have managed to snag all but one or two of the titles on MP3. To those who aren't familiar, imagine a child of the late 60's/early 70's suddenly discovering some guy named McCartney. You can read the comparisons in other reviews. The comparisons are legitimate and not always flattering to Sir Paul. Try it, you might like it more than you can imagine."
4,Emitt Rhodes,Emitt Rhodes is a treasure to find - an underrated McCartney-esque artist with a knack for songs that are catchy but interesting.
5,"awesome, addicting","i did like this game a whole lot, because out of all the other rollercoaster and themepark designing games this one gave you freedom, and creativity. although the graphics were shaky, the overall fun was good."
2,Bone Dry,"I'm not a researcher/academician so I can't rate this book from that perspective. As a layman, I found this book to be poorly written and bone dry. James Gilligan's books might be a better option."
5,Great for greasy clothes!,"The bottle said I could use this on clothing, so I put it to the test. My husband's job is very messy and he gets motor oil, contruction grime, and tar-like substances on his shirts all the time. Until this product, I was out of luck. To make it easier to apply, I moved it to a spray bottle. Now I just saturate the stain, let it sit for awhile, and wash it. His shirts come out looking new, and the laundry smells normal. I can't stand it when spray spot removers leave perfumes behind! This product is worth its weight in gold. I can't wait to try cleaning my floors with it!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"If there were negative star ratings, I would give this CD a -5 star! First, all of the ""music"" on this CD is done electronically, on a syntheysizer or some such electronic instrument, rather than with an orchestra or organ. NOTHING in the description of the product states that. Secondly, all the arrangements are terribly overblown; and, the voicing (the particular sound) is lackluster and muddy. Finally, most of the selections are ploddingly slow.As my title says, ""Don't Waste Your Money"" on this CD. I had to open it to listen to it. Otherwise, I would have returned it."
1,dollar store junk,"Dont waste your $$$. I bought these by mistake at Dunhams. They were $9.99 a box for two of them. I didnt even notice that there were two inside and they were 'snow shields'. They say they can be used for tubing on the box...and I was out to buy snow tubes.Basically they are tiny little inflatable snow shields you can velcro onto your wrists to deflect snow balls that are thrown your way.You CANT use them for tubing, because they are the size of a garbage can lid. Once a kid sits on them, they break.They are made of flimsy plastic like you would find in a dollar store inflatable.Pass these by!"
4,It wasn't anywhere near as bad as I thought it'd be,"I used this in my English class last semester and I loved it. It was split into three different sections with many essays from a multitude of people. Some of the text is really difficult to dissect and digest but we split it up amongst the class and the ideas introduced are really intriguing. Yes, it's literary theory, which can be tedious and a little boring sometimes, but the perspectives you get are fresh and it produces a lot of interesting class discussions (I'm a science person and I usually find other subjects pretty boring but this piqued my interest). The introductions help in getting a general feel for the material and understanding how they all tie in together. If you're getting this for an English class, look forward to it."
2,Great Book - Poor Print Quality,"H. Rider Haggard wrote amazing books that are still as deeply compelling today as they were when they were written in the 1900's. ""She"" and ""The Return of She"" are two of my favorites. Unfortunately, this publisher does not do justice to this great book. The print quality is extremely poor, particularly ruining the wonderful illustrations by Maurice Greiggenhagen. Anyone interested in this book should order a version by another publisher."
1,"did not realize it was a large xerox type of book, 8x11. wanted the paperback.",this isn't bound like a normal book. its some sort of large phone book sized thing. which is fine if u want that. but it should plainly say that the 'paperback' is big and its a xerox.
4,"Ayesha, the return of She","Facinating book. I think that She, Ayesha, and the third one, should be made into a proper miniseries for television. The film that I remember of She did not fit the details properly, and using a beautiful blond to depict a black-haired ethereal figure didn't serve the correct purpose. Excellent writing by the author gets the imagination running as we try to conjure up the places he describes. Great literature not to be taken too litterally, but giving great images of the British Empire at that time."
4,She's baaaaaack.,"I have to disagree that Ayesha is a failure next to She. I would encourage anyone who enjoyed She to try it. The story is expanded and concluded satisfactorily in a new setting with the same blend of suspense, tenderness, and philosophy that characterizes She. One of the book's weaknesses is that the numerous references to characters' past lives and Ayesha's own origins make the back story even more opaque than it is in She. Hopefully Wisdom's Daughter will make things clearer. I very much look forward to reading this and other Haggard novels."
3,Super Reader,"Leo has left, and Ayesha, he thinks, is dead. Do immortal antiheros with superpowers stay dead? Only sometimes, would be the answer to that question. This is most definitely not one of those times.Leo is a pretty hot guy, it seems, as the Queen of Kaloon falls for him, and he is in danger of yet another woman scorned. He now, of course, only wants Ayesha. Mortal types, in the end, can't handle the heat."
2,A failed sequel.,"One would suppose that Haggard felt confident with writing sequels considering the success he had with KING SOLOMON'S MINES and ALLAN QUATERMAIN. Unfortunately, the sequel to SHE is sub-par. Having read only 4 books by Haggard, I could hardly consider myself an expert on his writing, but the one aspect of his writing which I found so intriguing and entertaining was his descriptions of Africa and of the racist imperialist views of the Europeans in Africa. However, in AYESHA, the story takes place somewhere near China or Thibet or Russia (the exact location is never given, but only alluded to). Haggard has stepped out of an area in which he was comfortable, knowledgable, and successful. Unfortunately, by stepping out of the area in which he found the most success, he has fallen down and offered up only a meager tale which has to fight to hold the reader's interest."
2,Knights Breastplate,We bought this for our 14 year old son. He pointed out that it broke as soon as he wore it. We definitely noticed it was flimsy when we took it out of the packaging. And certainly not worth the $22 we spent on it (NOTE. Actual cost for items was $12 plus tax and shipping.)
2,"Cap is fine, Compatibility is not. It does not fit 2004 Taurus",Amazon's compatibility chart says it fits a 2004 Taurus. It does not. This appears to fit a three pin opening rather than the screw type it was replacing.
1,Doesn't work for 2007 Mustang,"Double-checked both on Ford's website as well as here on Amazon prior to ordering (both claim it is compatible), but this fuel cap does NOT fit my 2007 Mustang! Too wide!FYI, I also ordered at my own risk (Amazon reported it would not fit) a Motorcraft FC1062 Fuel Tank Cap after reading a recommendation on a Mustang Forum, but it also did not fit my car (too narrow). Had to return it."
2,not larry kanuit,stories seem to last forever and take way to long to go like it seems nowhere good book to get lost with because you will probably get rescued before you get anywhere with the stories.
3,It's good to have a little variety in the collection,"My introduction to Wire was hearing Ahead (from The Ideal Copy) and A Serious Of Snakes (from the Snakedrill ep - included on this CD) on KTUH (the University of Hawaii radio station back in the late 1980s. I never heard Wire in their inital incarnation as noisy art punks and when I did eventually buy Pink Flag (their debut) I found it quite claustrophobic and unpleasant. This collection is still rather noisy and unmelodic but it does have the aforementioned songs and the price was right (about $11.00 from Amazon.com ""Sellers""). No complaints. It just won't be played that often."
2,YAAAAaaaawwwwwwwnnnnn....,"Come on people! The only freakin' Wire album that matters is Pink Flag ... and it REALLY matters. Top ten punk rock album on anybody's list worth their duct tape. And don't bother with the new stuff either--4 old codgers staring at each other playing one note songs... YEEE! All you have to know is Pink Flag. This is great original stuff. After that they just tried to sound like every other lam-o in England. ...and I don't only listen to punk rock. If you want 80's English crap, get Echo and the Bunnymen. That's quality English hair music."
4,Look ma no hands!,"This is a great thing to have if you are always on the phone. I use it in the car, on the bus, and walking around town. Sometimes people wonder if I am talking to them. The wires sometimes get in the way."
2,"Confirmed, poor design","It's a very convient head-set that works very well, WHEN it works. I agree with some of the posts that the design is not robust. It falls apart within a month of use. I've had to replace mine several times now. The wire that connects to the microphone is poorly designed so that if you put enough strain on it, which is not much, you will start having static, noice, and complete cut-off of sound issues. If you choose to buy this product, buy several as a back up if you can affort it or just buy other aftermarket products that are cheaper."
2,Looking for a better headset,"Does not cut down on ambient noise, and makes my voice smaller on the phone. I found it clumsy to try and find earpiece and manage the wire. I think it would be better to have one of those boom-type microphones that gets closer to my mouth."
1,Kind of flimsy...,I've already been through 2 Nokia headsets and have just broken the another one. The design of the connection to the phone isn't very durable. It looks like I'm stuck with it until I buy a different kind of phone.
2,"Good sound quality, but uncomfortable","I've had the earbud for several months now. The sound quality is excellent - better than my handset. However, the foam cover for the earpiece fell off the first day, and the design doesn't have any mechanism to hold it in place in your ear. Because of this, it keeps falling out of my ear while I'm driving, which makes it even more distracting than holding the handset!"
4,"Handy, but uncomfortable","While I really appreciate this accessory and the freedom of movement that it allows (no more crick in the neck while trying to precariously clench my phone between ear and shoulder), the ear bud itself is uncomfortable. I can't hold a coversation for longer than a few minutes without my ear beginning to ache. I thought at first that I must just have ears that are an anomoly of nature, but after sharing my peeve with friends, I've found that quite a few other folks have the same gripe about this product."
1,"Love headset, unhappy with the durability","The way that the headset connects to the nokia phone is poorly designed. The connector is so flimsy, that it breaks easily. I have had to to purchase 3 new headsets in one year. The Motorola Startac has a much better design for headsets."
4,All in all quite satisfied,"After a year and a half, I am only on my second earbud. This has proved an indispensable accessory for me. My only real complaint about it is that the ringer tone does not sound in my ear. If my phone is clipped to my belt in a noisy environment such as a hockey game, I cannot hear it ring. All I get is a faint click in the earpiece, which could also be caused by the low-battery notification. In the car, however, it is great. I use it with the Nokia car holster and I find the combination quite convenient. The plug on this is prone to damage easily, but my current one continues to work adequately despite a slight amount of damage. I could also wish to boost the sound level a little, but the people I am talking to have no trouble hearing me. It took me a little while to get used to the microphone working fine despite being well away from my mouth."
3,now they tell me...,I had a time getting used to the earpiece but it did help me use the phone safely in the car. But the jack used to connect it to the phone is flimsy. The caveat mentioned in the description came true for me - the prongs on each side of the jack just snapped off one day. Now I can't plug it in the phone. I wish someone had warned me. I would have been more careful.
2,Not the best value compared to other Perlman CD,"I bought this CD only to find there are 4 concertos, RV 199, RV 356, RV 317, and RV 347, and 3 out of the 4 are already on a CD that I have by Perlman ""Vivaldi: The Four Seasons; Violin Concertos [includes 199, 356 and 347]"". I would recommend the Four Seasons CD instead which is less than half the price of the one I'm reviewing. That is, unless you really like the G minor RV 317.But then, Perlman's playing is beautiful, romantic and inspiring."
2,far from the best,"I bought this in a store looking for a replacement for my usual brand, Palanquin, and I was pretty disappointed. The bags don't have enough tea inside; you need to use at least two to make decent cup. The black tea had a bitter tang that the spice was unable to overcome. I won't be buying this one again."
4,HAW HAW!!,"Perhaps best-known for his Janis Joplin Cheap Thrills album cover and the X-rated film adaptation of Fritz the Cat, R. Crumb is the man who in the sixties brought the comics underground to light--a fact which made many with weak stomachs and bad consciences want to close their eyes. But the sublime and grotesque black-and-white drawings insist that you look as Crumb gives play to his sexual fantasies and keen social observations. Crumb draws it as he sees it, lampooning hypocrites of every ilk, from university thinktank eggheads to brutalizing cops to wigged-out counter-culture types with their hippier-than-thou halos and hangups."
3,A MIXED BAG,"Like all (or most, the ones that I have seen) of 19 Volumes of R. Crumb's complete comics, this Volume is a mixed bag. Some of the strips are for fans of his genre: funny, weird, druggy, sick, twisted. But he also mixes in his work with a greeting card companies (not needed) and jazz salutes (who carez!!)Don't get me wrong! I love Crumb!!! I own his DVD docu from years ago and a watch it once a month. FOR FANS ONLY should be an astute postscript. CCG"
1,More of the same in the sequal,"As a matter of fact, it is exactly the same as the original Dreamland. This inport from Germany has a different cover, has a different ordering of the tracks, 1 bonus track and 1 remix, but that's all that's different. So for those of you who want to get more of the great music you heard on the original Dreamland (which was a great CD, by the way), SAVE YOUR MONEY. Maybe Miles will come out with something new soon. In the meantime, I suggest Dream House, which has Children and Fable by Miles as well as many other tracks by different artists in the same style."
4,Morocco goes to Egypt,"Felt lucky to find this still on sale. Samira is from Morocco but her style is said to be that of her adopted country, Egypt. The CD is pleasant and varied all the way through. Mostly ballads with orchestral backing. More listening than party. You don't need to understand a word of Arabic to enjoy this album. I don't know why people want to compare her with Nawal Al Zoghbi, even less with Natacha Atlas, they are so different. I like all three but would not mix their tracks in the same playlist. Especially liked these songs - ""Koll El Awkaat"", ""Dahakteni"", ""Ragalak"". Regarding the comment about the sound balance, just add some warmth if you feel the need. The recording quality is good, the singing and music too."
3,not my favorite,"I thought this sounded canned, tinny, and too ""processed pop"". I chalk some of this up to my taste so I'm giving it three stars. She lacks the soul of Nawal el Zoghbi, who is light years better."
2,i would not use this string,"The string is fine for the first day. But it really loses its bounce. I would say im a 4-5 player, Ive played in tennis leagues. The second day of using these strings, im swinging hard at the ball but there is no transfer of power. Its like im using a wooden paddle. I ended up just giving away these strings"
5,Slept on my yours truly?!!,"I listen to all the Army stuff and I have seen JMT twice in the past year and I can't believe I missed the boat on this album. I have all the songs but amongst all the AOTP stuff I forgot how many of the songs were from Syze it's too bad his stage presence is subpar cause to me he sounds like a real life Big Pun. Best tracks 3 killer collab with Block McCloud and Pumpkinhead, 5 Roll out the Red, Syze with trumpets think runnin of the Bulls and mamis in South America, 6 who gonna ride with Faez One and Rocky Reyes still underground no R and Flea wannabes! 11 Machine Gun Rap laid back like a bottle of Cognac. 12 Poynt Blanc and Killer Rellik Reign of Tyrants sounds like somethin' off of Violent By Design grimy battle s@#$%^&t! Hard to rate among all Pharaohs albums cause I think I got a solid top three in no order Ritual of Battle, Blood Brothers, and Violent By Design. But definitely purchase this joint somehow."
2,The book is better.,"This is a story about a girl in an isolated community trying to find her identity in the shadow of her beautiful and much-loved sister. It was a good thing that I had read the book first because the movie looses much of the story, including the problems with the relationships between Sara Louise, the captain, and her sister. The movie, as usual, changes quite a few important parts of the story, making it a superficial production. My recommendation - read the book first then get the movie from the local library, don't spend money renting it."
3,Jacob Have I Loved,My husband and I watched this movie one evening.This is a difficult and frustrating movie to finish~If in real life you treat everyone in your family with equal amounts of love.You might want to pre-view this first before watching it for family night.Although it has good lessons. The way the parents have raised their girls is kind of messed up!We chose not to show it to our children after previewing it.
4,short and sweet.,"This was a good, modest film, graced by the presence of Bridget Fonda, who was excellent in a mousy, tomboy role. Her relationship with the elderly man was particularly touching. By the way, it CAN be found at BLOCKBUSTER!"
1,A REAL NO-BRAINER!,"Though I saw this movie last week I am still unable to grasp the concept and the point of the production. There are a million better things that I could have been doing with my children rather than watching this film. No wonder I had never heard of ""Jacob Have I Loved"" prior to my recent viewing. For heaven's sake-I rented it from my local library!(It probably doesn't have enough potential to be found in a descent place such as Blockbuster) I pity the next soul who wastes their time viewing this movie. And finally,a quote from my 10-year-old daughter, ""UGHH, Mom, I'd rather be in school than watch that again."""
4,Voivod is still alive,"This is a brilliant release. If Voivod decided to play hardcore it would sound like Breach's ""Venom"". Very reminiscent to the style of Coalesce, Deadguy, and Today is the Day. The album carries so much of emotion and anger you could almost feel it soaking into your poures. Their sound is very much american but not completely. l think they are somewhere from Western Europe, because some black metal melancholy shows here and there in their songs. anyway, it's a great album and a must for any noisecore fan."
3,"Lovely music, but silly and irritating sound effects","The music performed on this CD is beautiful to be sure, but for some reason, Previn has chosen to interject what sound like New Year's Eve noisemakers into the section of the first act party scene when the boys traditionally raid the girls' lullaby dance. This seems to ""dumb down"" the performance, as if Previn were trying to appeal only to young children....or worse, that Previn might think that young audiences would not be capable of enjoying this music without the interjection of these clearly non-musical party-favor sounds. Other than that grievance, the music is beautiful. I just cringe whenever that particular scene rolls around."
3,mixed feelings,"they are ok if you want to use them as a bite guard. I would not recommend for teeth whitening, since it is almost impossible to make them fit super well. this can lead to having whitener on your gums, which can lead to a chemical burn."
2,NOT STERILE MOUTH PIECES!!,"These items just come LOOSE, stuffed into a Mailer-bubble envelope. There was absolutely ""NO"" packaging around the mouth pieces, not even a simple ziplock baggie - nada, nothing. That is not sterile at all. In addition, ""NO"" instructions were enclosed to tell me how to do it! I'm really disgusted. I'm going to have to look on the internet to find out how to make them. The point is ""Who does something like that??""...Somebody very inconsiderate!!"
1,"Primitive, at best.","I ordered the Opalescence 35% and 3 D.I.Y trays in a package all together and while the whitening gel was as described, the trays were a great disappointment. I wasn't sure what to expect and from the other reviews I had read I figured that perhaps I should try it out on my own and not go by others opinion. The trays are very thick acrylic that doesn't mold to your teeth as you would think they do, even by following step by step instructions. Very poor quality trays and not good for using with whitening gel. Playing football, perhaps. Ive decided to invest money in a professional dental trays instead."
2,D.I.Y. (Do It Yourself) Moldable THERMOFITTING Teeth Whitening Trays,"Ummm, as others have stated. Trays are to thick. I kept putting them in hot water until they were molded. They shrunk to small to fit the back teeth and really did not form fit my teeth to closely. Better than nothing, but there are better options. As they say, 'you get what you pay for' !!"
2,Generic Sport teeth guards,"These are just generic sport teeth guards, had I realized that to begin with I might have purchased them at a local store. They work okay.... I don't feel like my teeth have the right contact with the trays that they need to get the full effect of the bleech. You dip them in hot water then put them in your mouth and they shrink a little to fit your mouth, but not realy your teeth, just your mouth. If your going to spend the $$$ on bleech, its probably a good idea to spend the $$$ on better trays than these ones. (I ruined the first one, by putting it in boiling water for 6 seconds instead of 2-3 seconds like the directions said. So if you do get these take the directions seriousley. :)"
1,Doesn't work!,"These do not work properly, they do not conform to your mouth. Don't waste your money!"
2,Too thick,"The gaurds were really thick, which I thought was going to be a good thing. I followed instructions but before I could put them in my mouth to mold, they folded over on themselves. I got three in a package and don't you know, all three got ruined when I tried to mold them. Oh well."
1,Moldable fitting,"It took a while to receive this and when it came, I found out why!!!! It came from China. How do I know there is not harmful chemicals in there!!"
3,It's Okay!!!!,"when it arrived, it arrived in a shipping bubbled bag and thats it, nothing else.. wasn't too happy about that but whatever. They are very big so what I recommend doing is boiling some water and dipping them in, For two reasons , one to sanitize them and two, to mold your teeth. I dipped them in the boiling water , waited a few seconds and stuck them in my mouth to start molding,(you can redip till you have your desired mold).Once I had my desired mold, (wasnt perfect but it was the closest I could get them), I ran them under cold water to lock in the mold. when I used them it was okay, nothing really major, thy're still alittle big so its alittle hard keeping them stuck on your teeth. They are okay for beginners and for someone just looking for some cheap molds but if you whiten your teeth alot, I suggest getting some better ones, not these."
1,Bad Seller,"I never received the product, and after letting the seller know that was told it was between me and the Post Office. Never again!!"
2,No. Just no,"Ok this is a DIY so not perfect, but my goodness the tray is EXTREMELY bulky, makes your mouth look like a monkey mouth. It's like wearing a football mouth guard! So not cute, and not very functional either"
4,molds well,had a little problem but finally got the right fit. It worked well and very happy when combined with the teeth whitening syringes.
2,horrible,"Where to begin? I gave them two stars for being cheap, but they don't mold properly and the instructions are wrong,if you boil for as long as stated they don't mold, if too long they turn to gel, and collapse on themselves as a sticky mess."
2,Unfortunately,"This product didn't really work for me. I followed the directions, but no matter how hot the matter was, the mold did't not even break it's form."
1,the trays are not flexible,"the trays do not fit at all in your mouth. there's no instructions, came from China took a month to receive it.yes, they were cheap. now I know why. they are not moldable trays, that you would heat up and then press in your mouth to form.Would never recommend this product. not worth the expense to return them either."
1,Waste of money!,"Unlike other buyers, the directions were wrote in just one paragraph. Boil water, put tray in for 3 seconds, put in mouth, suck out air, rinse with water and dry, Now I have 3 pieces of useless plastic and tubes of whitener I can't use,"
1,not to happy,This item was more like a football mouthpiece than the trays I have used in the past for whitening. They are heavy and triming is required. They were low cost but not a great product for whitening.
3,I don't know what to think of this product.,"I tried the instruction, it worked but not that great. I don't think it's worth this much."
1,Horrible waste of money,These trays are horrible and useless they dont conform to the teeth and melt quickly. Complete waste of money.
4,Gotta do what you gotta do,I am glad I got to find these. My teeth are very important to me and I love that I don't need to order a custom made piece to protect them when I sleep or to treat them.
2,NOT IMPRESSED. Very primative. and too thick,"I followed the directions to the T but they would NOT melt! (it says to ""use hot water about the same as hot coffee"". Nothing!)So after 3 tries of increasing the hot water I finally BOILED water and dipped it in the hot water using a pair of pliers as not to burn myself.Then quickly tried to fit it to my teeth following the directions. A minute later. Not impressed. The plastic is just too thick.Luckily yesterday I found my PROFESSIONAL trays my dentist made that I had thought I'd lost which are so thin and fit perfectly you barely know you are wearing them. Nope. I would NOT recommend the DIY trays. Sorry."
3,Not the best but got the job done,These molding trays aren't the greatest but for the low price I can't complain too much. They did their job and that's all that matters.
2,DIY Teeth Trays,"Ordered these for a friend so they could use with the Day Whitening Kit and they're pretty naff, would advise that you pay the extra and get a dentist to make a proper fitting set."
4,Zoom In: Rape Apartments,"If you're a fan of Eurocult GIALLO films about black-gloved sadistic sex killers enacting Freudian depredations on beautiful, frequently under-dressed women and you've been wanting to sample one of Impulse Pictures' intriguing array of Nikkatsu Studios DVD's, well, you're one sick ticket! Oh, and you might want to pick up this batshit-crazy mini-masterpiece about a wandering wife who crosses paths with a sinister pervert running around a disturbingly post-apocalyptic-looking late 70's urban Japan attacking sweet young things and committing arson by roasting their primly unexposed muffins!... Yes, this at-times-surreal fever-dream is the DVD to grab! Political correctness, post-mod feminism and traditional slasher tropes are all gleefully put to the torch like so many optically fogged muffins! You'll be quoting the saucy subtitles for DAYS! --- LEIA LaBIBLIA"
2,Not what I was expecting...,"I want hardcore, not a dumb story! Watching Asian guys attempt to have their way with a woman is laughable in this movie...."
3,Not very convenient,"This holster sure holds the phone securely but has the disadvantage that you have to take the phone out of the holster to use the phone(the Swivel holster does not have this disadvantage)The good thing about this can be that you don't have to remove the phone from the holster to charge it, which can be quite irritating like with the holster that ships with the phone.Overall, the rotating holster seems to be a better buy."
5,Ridiculously good.,"The album is so good, swings so hard and the arrangements are exellent. All of the players-Carter, Hawkins, Rouse, and Woods-are in top form backed by a superb rhythm section. Definitely get this if you have any interest in jazz whatsoever."
5,"Remastered or not, it's awesome.","My copy is the first CD release of ""Further Definitions: The Complete Further Definitions Sessions"" -- the copy listed here is a digitally remastered version of the copy I own. Get your hands on either one. As other reviewers have noted, the 1st 8 tracks are from a 1961 recording session and the remaining 8 were recorded with differing personnel in 1966. These latter tracks were produced more along the lines of Oliver Nelson's ""Blues and the abstract truth"" -- also from Impulse. In fact the cover design will look hauntingly familiar. Never mind, this CD is definately worth owning. I rate it as my 3rd favorite recording with Benny Carter, with ""3, 4, 5 The Verve Small Group Sessions"" as #1."
4,"Despite cheesy title and terrible cover, it was a nice read.","I avoided this book during dozens of trips to the bookstore. The title and the cover seemed too cheesy. However, I finally saw it at Target one day and gave it a chance. I'm glad I did.The Goddess Rules is a nice beach read. The characters are all interesting and the plot is pretty predictable, but I found it enjoyable nonetheless. If you are looking for a fun distraction, this is it."
4,Mirri Makes It,"Somehow I seemed to have missed Clare Naylors past books but took notice to The Goddess Rules. The story started off a bit slow for me but once I hit about page 40 it started to pick up at a nice pace.Kate thought she was in love with long time on again, off again boyfriend Jake until Mirabelle Moncour comes into her life. Mirabelle, who always has men falling at her feet, begins to teach Kate the rules of love and sex and most importantly makes Kate believe in herself and that she is worthy of true love.Since this is chick lit, the ending will be no surprise for you but it was fun getting there. Mirri, my favorite character is a hoot and Kate is very endearing. Enjoy!"
2,Disappointed,"I was a little disappointed in this book. My favorite book of Clare Naylor is Dog Handling. It has a great plot until chapter 20, I don't want to ruin it for anyone. Of course the ending was great, but I did not know if I could finish it after chapter 20."
3,Interesting characters,"I don't read a lot of novels and when I do I like an escape, yes, but also intelligent reading and a variety of interesting characters - some whom I may relate to and some that are like north and south poles. This book has a couple of characters that are in the latter category, but none in the former. The main plot is nothing new, but it still made a nice escape. There were a few English cultural references that I did not fully understand...but I expected it as the author is from England and the story takes place there. One thing I do not appreciate is having to put up with frequent usage of the ""f"" word, and thankfully the author keeps it to a fair minimum in this story. Overall an ejoyable book."
4,British Artist VS French Actress,"I'm working my way through Naylor's titles and I like the fact that they aren't just carbon copies of the one before. This one starts out with insecure Kate lavishing devotion on a boyfriend who treats her badly. She takes a dislike to the aging French film star, Mirri Moncure, who gives her unwanted advice on her dubious romance. I didn't like the film star or Kate either, at first. Gradually Kate and I were won over by Mirri's joie de vivre and outrageous behavior.There are funny moments (think Bridget Jones), touching scenes, and growth in all the characters. I enjoy the British descriptions and way of thinking which butts heads with the French approach to life and love in this book. Hang in past the initial resistance to the characters and you will be rewarded with a good story."

3,"Good, but not great","First of all this IS not a bad compilation. And second of all this was before horrible 'Load' and 'Reload' so its good you wont hear those songs on it. However, Metallica hasn't sang most of the songs live on this in a while, so they wont sound as good as they did back in the 80's. The songs on the 'Black Album' still sound good though, well they are only two years old. Its not that the songs from Kill, Lightning, Puppets and Justice are bad, they're just not that great, but most fans will recognize them and still be proud to be a Metallica fan. The DVD is awesome though. If you dont like the albums then just pop in the DVD and be prepeared to air guitar/air drum your way through the loud heavy metal. This doesn't have Burton on it (RIP my master), but that doesn't mean its bad. Burtons tragic death was in '86 anyway, this came out in '93. Overall this is a good compilation, but dont be expecting anything out of the ordinary.Albums: 6/10DVD: 9/10Overall: 7.5/10 - 3.5 stars"
1,A waste of time and money,"I'm a huge fan of old metallica, but not much of a fan at all over the last 10 years. The only reason I bought this was to get the Seattle show on DVD, but 10 seconds into it, when I found out it did not have 5.1 audio, I realized that I got ripped off by the new ""All we want is all of your money"" metallica. Kerry King of Slayer was right when he said James Hetfield should probably retire."
1,Do not buy this!,It needs to be said that I am a long time die-heart Metallica fan.I've always put off buying this set because of the price. I wasn't convinced that what you pay is offset by what you get. I finally broke down and got it. Simply put my instincts were right on. This CD/DVD is not worth it. The sound quality is terrible and you already have the songs on some other Metallica CD. You can't justify spending over fifty bucks on something that Metallica dragged out of their circular file. Besides you will get sick and tired of James Hetfield's constant cursing. There is just no reason for it.I advise you not to buy this CD/DVD. Save your money.
5,two thumbs up,"i recently aquired this masterpiece and it rules. by far metallicas best collection of music and video. i would recomend this to any metallica fan, hardcore or just starting out."
3,Good but....,"This box set is for extreme Metallica fans only. I for one list them as one, if not, my favorite band of all time, but even I thought this box set was overkill. Three tapes of live performances then 3 cds with more live songs. It is all the same. I think they could have done with one tape and one cd honestly.For the amount of money the item costs new, you had better be a hardcore fan or you are wasting your money."
5,Metallica at their best!!!,"This has to be one of the finest offerings by one of the most talented heavy metal bands in history!!! I have yet to see them live, but after watching the 2 DVD set I'm wondering if it gets any better?! The second DVD from the Justice Tour just rules!! I've never see a band perform with such intensity. Let's not take anything away from the 3 Disc set either. There's nothing better than jamming to a ""LIVE"" Metallica CD in your car!! It doesn't get any better than this... if only Jason would have stayed!"
5,If you haven't heard anything off this the you've been...,DEPRIEVED. Every Metallica fan or who calls themself one should atleast find a way to hear this cause this is great.
5,"A must, for Metallica Fans.","Metallica with Jason Newsted on bass. Metallica Fans, a must have in your collection, especially live. Captures their time & moments in the music industries in the 90's. Fresh, hungry men to rock the world. Music best entertainment & in the business."
4,Great Metallica Video,I bought this because plain and simple i needed a metallica dvd. The DVD is great it has a lot of great songs for the average metallica fan. I bought this for two reasons one being that i wanted to watch them preform live and two i wanted to have all there live songs in my ipod. I only used the cds once because now adays all you need is the music in your ipod and you're good to go. The Reason i gave it 4 stars was because i only watched it once and it didnt have me coming back for more if you know what i mean. It was great the first run through but after that I just stored it away. Overall its a good dvd and the live cds are a plus so from one metallica fan to another if you're thinking about getting this go for it.
4,Absolutely Awesome,"This box set puts the band right in front of you and blows you away. The CD set is awesome, though I san't tell why James's guitar is more quiet than Kirk's. And on the San Diego tape, the extended version of One will have you jost rocking out totally. On the 2nd CD, the horsemen play Whiplash so fast you'll be going nuts. The greatest hard rock band to ever grace a stage and here you have three different concerts from them. The book sucks, and pages fell out after I looked at it like 4 times. The best video though is the Seattle '89 video. Blackened, the whole Puppets, Justice, Breadfan (edited horribly, watch it you'll see). If you hate old Metallica, first off, shame on you and second, you won't like this set. If you hate new Metallica, again shame on you. But this set is for ALL Metallica fans, and a must own for us Metallifreex."
4,excellent purchase!!!,"When listening to live shows on dvd/cd you'll never get the same quality you get when you listen to the studio tracks. But it is close on these disks! I was highly impressed!! What makes concerts awesome is how they often include more guitar sounds or they may change the melodies slightly. Not to mention you get extended drum solos, guitar solos, etc. So its worth it to buy these disks just for that very reason! The dvds are definitely high quality in my opinion. They include many different camera views so its very entertaining to watch. The original booklet is included on the dvd and all the files are in jpg format. You can view the files in an easy reader software they include. Or I explored the dvd on my computer and copied them to my hard drive. You can then edit the files and you can easily read them if you zoom in. It's very easy to read!! I was definitely not disappointed with this set!!"
5,HOLY SH**,The Best Live stough the Boys Ever did . The Mexico City concert seemed to go on forever . I have on tape but its still prettry good . The tapes I have of the Concert for VHS are very good and funny love the Walk This Way Segment !!! Anyways a good live thing to have of the Tallica boys !!!
5,Classic Metallica,This CD & DVD set really captures the shows I saw from that tour. They were Great !!!
5,"Two words: Oh, Yeah","Oh man! I just got this stuff home, and I've only gotten a chance to listen to the 3 CDs! If that isn't enough, the booklet is awesome. On top of that, you've got 3 rocking vids, a snake pit pass, and a stensil from the box!If you liked the album versions of the songs on the CDs, then you will love the live versions from Mexico City, Seattle, and San Diego. Trust me, this is a must have for any and all hardcore Metallica fans, and metal fans in general."
2,what a waste of money,"i'm a big fan of metallica and metal music in general, but while seeing metallica in concert is a true experience, the sound quality on these CDs is lacking.since it would be about the same price to buy most of metallica's catalog, use your money to buy ride, load, reload, master, and the black album and you'll be much more satisfied. don't make the same mistake i did."
3,Good Bang for the Buck,"You get the band in there prime and it shows. I would have liked to know about the nude women before I got it. I expected the crude language, but didn't expect them to grunt around like cavemen. It boasts a lot of minutes of music, and there is, but there is also a ton of wasted time and crowd noise. The booket may as well not be on the DVD because you can't read anything that's in it.James' booze problem is apparent and now all these years later he's having to deal with rehab and rebuilding his life that alcohol stole from him, see ""Some Kind of Monster"".This is a boxed set for mature people, adults. The sound quality is there and music wise it's a great bang for the buck. I'm a guitar player and I'm into live music. This is the only Metallica cd's and DVD's I own. If I owned their other cd's I would probably be disappointed with this because it rehashes everything they have done."
2,Keep your VHS box,"I'm one of the biggest Metallica fans in the world, but this is not a very impressive release from them. The contrast on the DVDs is decent but the video transfer looks terrible, especially on Seattle. Think of listening to a bootleg with too much noise reduction used and try and picture the Seattle show that way. And absolutely NOTHING in terms if 5.1 mixing, just plain old stereo makes these DVDs worthless and a waste of money unless you dont have the VHS set already. A half-assed job which unfortunately could've been so much more. And the extras? HAH, pictures and lyrics, wow."
3,Not enough...,"The Good Things: This box contains the Live show in Mexico City in 3 cd's (just like the original...) It features also the other 2 shows (San Diego and Seattle) in DVD, wich is good 'cause VHS sometimes get stuck on VCR's. It keeps the stencyl and the Snake Pit Pass, but...The Bad things: The book is not included as a book, but as a virtual document on the second DVD, the size isn't anymore a huge special package like the original, it looks a little bit more like any common ""cd's set""... Where's the ""special"" now???..."
2,Mediocre Metal,"The camera work on the concert DVDs looks like something the local community college art dept. may have produced. The camera never stops flashing back and forth one angle to the next. A real headacher indeed. Two stars only because it's Metallica, any other band would get one star. Good idea, poor effort."
4,Pudo ser mejor,"Si pudo ser mejor pero desafortunadamente no incluyen el video del concierto en México que fue tal vez el mejor concierto que ha dado Metallica en Latinoamérica, se hubiera llevado las 5 estrellas pero ese detalle les fallo, además de haber incluido el libro dentro del DVD y no como lo hicieran el la caja de VHS. Pero aun así Metallica es el mejor grupo de Heavy Metal en el mundo.SEE YAA!!!"
3,Video and sound are subpar,"I have the original box set from the week it was released. When I finally updated it by purchasing the newer version on CD and DVD I was shocked that they had not updated the sound or video quality one bit.The box set is very nice and the two videos are well done but they are truly VHS quality so don't expect Cunning Stunts here.And why couldn't they do a 5.1 mix? If Deep Purple can update Machinehead for the new century why can't the Metallica camp get their crap together?On the plus side, for $50 you get a lot of live Metallica!"
4,One of the best box sets.,A great re-release of the box set. But what happen to the 72 page book. I would give this five stars but there isn't no 72 page book. The only way I could see it is on the second dvd. But it's just not the same. Anyway this is still a great box set and great live songs. It's metallica at it's finest. If you want to hear songs before load and metallica with long hair than man will you love this set. It's a must for all metallica fans.
1,Get the VHS instead!!,"I fully agree with the first comment I read here (from fixxxer410): I have the VHS box set and I'm deeply disappointed by this DVD reissue.The image quality is simply poor (nothing to compare with the sublime Cunning Stunts or S&M) on both Seattle and San Diego DVDs.The sound quality is not really better than the image quality, and is only available in 2-chanel (and not in PCM). No DTS, No 5.1.As for the extras, OK, you can display the lyrics on your TV screen. Yeepee.And the screensaver and virtual 72-page booklet will NOT WORK ON MACINTOSH unless you have Virtual PC, of course.So forget about that reissue and do yourself a favor: get the gorgeous VHS box set instead. ;)"
1,Defrauded,"The product's detailed information specified that it comes with 3 CDs and 2 DVDs, but it only comes with 1 DVD, the Seattle concert DVD is missing"
5,sweet,this is so awesome. great concerts. great everything. but you people are stupid to pay 89 bucks for it. i got the whole set for $2 at a garage sale. and everythings perfect.
2,[...] This was before they sold out.,"Used to have this boxset, with the vhs tapes, $[...] back in the 90's. this was good, with vhs,cds' live music, way before they sold out. at the peak 93'."
2,Not What You Think,"The audio Cds are just what you'd expect of Metallica from that era. Good tunes played well. HOWEVER.....the video from 1992/3 is simply terrible. The director/whoever has almost the entire video played in a ""stop-action"". You never really see the band playing. It looks like a cheap video you'd see on MTV. Add to it the director can't let go of the joy stick constantly flashing to different scenes never seeing much of anything.You never feel like you are at the show....you feel removed. That is not the case with the 1989 show. That was infinitely better. It is unfortunate that you don't see the band play. Just as Kirk is about to solo, the shot goes to Lars. Can't understand that. For the true fan."
1,Disappointing,This download is a rip-off. I love this work of Rachmaninov & this download is flawed. It leaves out many music phrases. Donlt waste your money with this oneJ
2,garmin,What can I say. Save your money. There are better ways to get this map. I would say just average at least for me. This map is the same as the none topo version of the city navigator except it is supposed to have topo info on it which it does but just average at that. Garmin has been eating to much big dog cat food. It has gotten too fat off it's customers.
4,Southeast Topo,A little outdated and not sure if your able to get an upgrade or not? Still comes in handy though.
2,"Make sure you want the 100k detail, not 24k (more detailed).","I ordered this map, assuming it was based on 24k USGS maps. When it arrived, I noticed that in the lower corner of the package it said 100k. This means than one inch of the map is equal to 100,000 inches (1.57 miles). This compares to one inch of the 24k map being 0.37 miles. When you consider that the map is in 2 dimensions, this means that the 100k map has about 1/16th as much detail as the 24k map. When you are using a map for hiking, small scale is very important.The 24k map is available on Amazon.com at the time of this review (12/2009) and is only about $10 more.Garmin Topo U.S. 24k Mountain North - Idaho-Montana-Wyoming"
4,MicroSD Topo card in Garmin GPSMAP 60Cx,"I used the Garmin MicroSD Data Card in my Garmin GPSMAP 60Cx on a two week hunting trip in Montana in November,2008. Performance was excellent after I called Garmin tech support to find out how to view the topo data (that would be drill down in scale until the GPS will display topo data).The chips are pricey. I would have used a data CD but Garmin is not Macintosh friendly, so I needed to buy the chips for my hunt.The chips are not marked as to data content, so I used a small ziploc bag to hold the data chip and a note on the contents. Otherwise your option is to install the chip in the GPS and then view the title."
3,GOOD MAP THAT COULD BE MUCH BETTER!,"Bought this SD Card Map to use with my Garmin Nuvi 350 on a trip to Toroweep on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. The dirt road is 61 miles with many other roads crossing and intersecting with it. Even though many of the roads had Forest Service road numbers, the map often did not show these numbers. The less traveled roads did not present a problem, but some were as well used as the one I was on. If I was counting on only the GPS map, (which is not a good idea) I might have taken a wrong turn several times.On the same trip, I had similar problems on dirt roads in the St. George, Utah area."
2,map is out of date,names of paths and some roads had changed. This map looks 30yrs out of date. Used map with Garmin 400c and find the points are 500-600 feet off.Save your money.
3,"Ample features, but poor design","The tripod is a heavy unit. Not certain about you, but due to its weight, I feel quie comfortable connecting an expensive digi-cam or camcorder to it. The biggest drawback consists of the positions of the adjustment knobs! When you have a camera equipped with a telephoto lens attached to the unit, attempting to adjust the lateral swivel can be a pain in the butt for those of us with above average (or even average) sized anglo saxon hand sizes. Vivitar did equip this unit with mostly metal mechanisms--which is a BIG plus!"
3,Medic Vol. 1,"Despite the understandably low quality of the DVD, I thoroughly enjoyed seeing this series again as I remembered it fondly. Even though there have been outstanding medical breakthroughs in the intervening decades, this show stood out as an interesting and informative source of information. It is also a treat to see some actors who went on to much bigger and better things."
3,Vintage Richard Boone,"If you are a fan of the late Richard Boone, this show may interest you. It was such a long time ago, when TV was a fairly new medium and recording techniques were primitive, that it is very dated. ""Have Gun, Will Travel"", even at the beginning, was a big step ahead of this. This set is more of a collectors item than a group of shows to enjoy over and over."
4,Unexpectedly Good,"This is a good movie and well worth your time and money.This is an excellent example of a moderately budgeted film without the extreme special effects of overblown Hollywood ""blockbusters"". It delivers an involving story, convincing characters, and really shames the Hollywood elite who think ""Hancock"" is what the public wants.It is obvious that research was done to find out how special forces units work, act, and speak. This is appreciated when you consider that may of the movies out there don't even have rank insignia placed on uniforms correctly. This is a real irritant for someone who has military experience.The story itself is a take on ""Heart of Darkness"" and I think that is all I'll say about the plot...A well done story, an excellent cast, and way beyond the Hollywood drek.Well done!"
4,What is the Objective,The movie is truly enjoyable and I have watched it several times. The ending is rushed a bit but with this type story there was no way to wrap it up without some type of over the top scenario. I hope you enjoy it.
2,Nothing ever happens,"Wow, how long can you draw something out and then have nothing happen in the end? Judging by the description this should have been enjoyable for me."
1,"False Ratings; Amazon, please remove this movie.","I won't even bother wasting time with a lengthy review, but unlike the movie I'll quickly get to the point, with a conclusion.SPOILERS -Soldiers enter the desert with a CIA agent, they get picked off one by one from flashing lights. Once real-world issues such as dehydration set in and the group is minimized from 8 to three people, the CIA agent finally details the most of the story you'll get from this movie - unknown hostile energy in the desert that will vaporize you. He sees a mirage, flashing lights, ends up in a hospital bed/weird coma. Perhaps it was all in his mind?! Oh wait, he's clutching a coin.The end.That pretty much sums up the entire 1hr 30min movie. You've saved yourself that time and annoyance. Seriously avoid this movie and rate it as low as you possibly can. Amazon, please remove this film!"
4,"Scariest movie I've ever seen, not exagerating.","I watched the movie expecting kind of an Alien type of theme or a Predator, kind of action with the good guys kicking ass and taking names.This is nothing like that, though it feels like that at first, the squad in the movie basically goes on a mysterious mission and just out of this world type of s*** happens to them *spoilers now*, a guy gets like vaporized, they have no idea where they're going, their water becomes sand.Might seem like it's a bunch of crazy unbelievable stuff, that would just leave you thinking how stupid it is, but they do it really well - I give it an 11 of 10 on the creepy s*** scale. Seeing hardened military guys in the dessert getting totally pwn3d by out of this world entity (entities?) really gets your heart pumping.Scariest movie I ever saw, ever, and I saw it years ago. Person who said it's like X-Files mixed with Blair Witch is right, only it's a level beyond that."
2,B movie to good for this C?,"interesting premise, fairly incoherent, doesn't deliver, I will give the military consultant some credit for some of at the early combat sequences and equipment.. thats all."
2,It had potential....,"I think the story had potential, but it completely fell apart toward the end. I haven't read all the other reviews, so I don't know if the cat has been let out of the bag with respect to how this movie ends. I won't mention any specifics about the ending. What I will say though is that I was left with the impression that the writers simply didn't know how to end it, so they came up with some totally whacked, nonsensical ending that did not wrap the movie together. As for acting, I'd give it a 5 out of 10. I've seen better, but surely I've seen worse. Overall though I could only give it two stars b/c the writes completely bombed the ending."
1,Don't waste your time,"Stiff actors, poor plot, boring dialog and a terrible ending. I want my hour and half back, don't waste your time."
2,goes nowhere,This movie goes nowhere. Thank goodness I watched it free with prime. I kept hoping the ending would make the whole movie worth watching but it doesn't. The ending doesn't tell you anything. watching this movie is a waste of time.
2,Terrible ending.,This movie doesn't deserve a proper review. It had a terrible ending leaving me feeling like I wasted me time.
1,"bad acting, bad script","not much to say, you have to see it to really know how bad it is. Sometimes, it is beyond me of how these movies find legit budgets"
2,What Objective?,"The CIA already knows what's going on and sends a black ops team out to find the aliens that they already know about. The movie is just a lot of walking through the Afghan desert with the occasional encounter with terrorist fighters and bright flood lights that can kill. There is no true conclusion to the story, so we can only hope that if they make a part two its more about the aliens and less about the scenery. Worth watching if you don't care about not seeing anything interesting and being left hanging."
2,Do not waste your time..,I have to say this was the worst movie I have watched in years.I am a big scifi fan and this was not even close to a good movie.
4,Challenging,"Hmm, odd one this, rich in texture, the look and feel of Afghanistan are nicely captured in this quirky little film, well acted, and nicely shot, very much like ""Monsters"" this film is more about the journey than whats actually at the end. The prickly CIA operative and the quarrelsome bickering special forces team are counterpointed against a bleak backdrop and increasing wierdness of their situation..in the end, the question is ""what was it all about""? I'm not really sure, but this is a nicely shot and thought provoking film. Well done."
4,Better than you might think.,"Although this movie was made with a fairly small budget you would never know it. There is a feeling of gritty realism resulting from good dialogue and good acting by the cast of relatively unknown actors. This disc is a great deal at the price and worth twice the amount I have paid for some real stinkers (I like to check out low budget movies - call me crazy). This movie was far better than such recent bombs as ""Transformers 2"", and deserves a look. I found it creepy and entertaining."
1,Wow...what a horrible movie. Just awful.,Don't waste your time on this horrible thing. Please change the rating system to include something lower than one star.
1,Kept waiting for the plot to happen..,"This movie is like an ""Apocalypse Now"" in the desert, and even has the special military agent with the internal monologue. But in this film they never find ""Colonel Kurtz"". Ugh."
3,Mediocre Movie,"Not a complete waste of time, but the plot was thin. The characters were not developed very well and the special effects were flimsy. A better explanation of what they were looking for was in order."
1,This movie sucked and was a waste of 2 hours of my precious life,"Just rented this, the wife gave me an option of this movie and some other movie, I mistakenly picked this. I really have no idea where all these positive reviews come from, the only justifiable reason for giving this movie a positive review would be to lie to yourself and say I did not just waste 2 hours of my life watching this boring, unclimactic, worthless piece of garbage. This movie is sparse with activity, it literally is a movie about a bunch of soldiers walking in the desert, very rarely something happens. I must have walked away for 25 seconds and missed the whole squad get killed or seperated from the CIA operative, I really didn't care to rewind because everything I saw about this movie was boring, simple, and completely idiotic. Another independant boring film with no plot."
1,Disappointing,"I wish I had read some of the reviews before I rented this one. I had really wanted to see this movie when it came out on rental and all I can say is, ""One big disappointment"". The sad part about all of this is it had the makings of a pretty good movie. So much more could have been done with this. It kept getting harder and harder to watch and the ending though I understood it could have been much better as well. So, I will be sure the next time to read the reviews and ask some friends before I rent another movie ever."
1,The road to nowhere -or- a lack of objective,"This movie starts off with an interesting premise, but quickly wanders into a no man's land of characters and events that have little explanation and no logical conclusion. I found myself not caring what happenned to the characters as long as something happenned. If you bother watching the movie you will find that nothing ever does happen. I am a Prime member so I watched the movie for Free . . . it was not worth the price of admission."
4,The Vimanas are awesome,"This movie starring Jonas Ball as a CIA operative on mission in Afghanistan leading a well armed squad, is an attempt to bring forward information which has been historically recorded, regarding the Vimana Spacecraft as detailed in Ancient Indian literature. Just look into it, as these Vimana's are a part of Earth's Cultural history.The truth behind Electro-gravitics Technology, is it always gets re-discovered and this is the way the elite re-acquire the technology, through False Flag Warfare, then it's easy to move troops. This isn't a new theme, as it's actually why the knight's Templar were looting the catacombs under Solomon's Temple, and Hitler's 10th Armored Division were in N. Africa. It's all about the technology. I've a youtube site with more of this esoteric information, google mulder2400, or net search The Vimanas or Electrogravity, Biefeld Brown, Mono-Atomic Gold (it has a levatating property/ Shimana Field) etc. RAJ"
1,DO NOT WATCH,"Do not watch this movie at all, even if you are just looking for a way to kill time. There are plenty of other low-budget films out there with at least minimal entertainment value. This movie is not one of them. I'm not exaggerating when I tell you this film is simply terrible and a complete waste of time. Even by Amazon rating standards, this film is horrible. This was the worst movie I've seen in years. I would give it zero stars if that were possible. I normally don't write any reviews for Amazon, but I had to make an exception in this case. This film is an insult to everyone who enjoys a good movie."
2,Mediocre low budget effort from Myrick,"I had high hopes for this movie. The premise seemed promising. However, it turned out to be another mediocre effort from another ""Hollywood"" political lefty. Myrick attempts to display his disdain for America by portraying an ""arrogant [United States] military"" in their quest to find - well, we're not sure. If you can find this film in the cut-out bin, or for less than $5, I say why not buy it if you like to see a promising idea be bastardized by a guy who evidently just doesn't like America. By the way, Myrick himself makes these statements in his interview contained in the DVD Bonus Features."
4,I liked it,"Yes it is slow moving and I kept waiting for something ""big"" to happen or some kind of ""revelation"". I really liked the mythology references and the narration by the main character. The ending allowed you to draw your own conclusions instead of being told what to think about the situation. If you like mainstream movies, definitive conclusions or happy endings, then I could see how this could be rated low, but if you don't mind movies that make you think or question things, then this is for you."
4,It's good,This is decent science fiction. I hope they make a sequel of it as well. It's not fruity or campy and that makes it far better than a lot of TV.
3,"""That could have been a good movie""","It's just OK. The story, production values etc. are all fine.The dialogue was a not well done . Some performances were a bit wooden and the objective was not well illustrated. When it was over, I couldn't help thinking,""That could have been a good movie""."
2,Um.....,It's like eating candy made out of artificial sweeteners. No matter how much you eat you can never be satisfied. It's just empty calories.
2,I think they lost their objective,This movie had no ending. It answers no questions that are raised through out the film. It's a waste of time.
1,Are you kidding me????,I dont know where these good reviews are coming from....this movie was absolutely senseless. I watched it based on the reviews and was exetremely disappointed.Edit: Had to edit some of my comments because they werent very nice or objective. They were right after I watched the movie. I will say though: This movie was pointless and without any clear plot. If you have never heard of this movie when it came out (like me) there is a reason. If you look on other sites for reviews you will find out how poor this film was actually rated.
2,"Don't make ""The Objective"" your objective tonight.","Had potential, initial storyline and fight scenes were ok but it all lead up to nothing in the end. This may be the worst lead actor and movie I haveseen this year. Thank goodness I didn't have to pay for it. You should get paid to watch this movie, it's that bad!"
1,"Movie goes no where, waste of time.",I like Sci-Fi but this is one of the most terrible films I have ever seen in my lifetime. At the beginning your wondering where this movie will take you but you never find out. The movie industry should be setting standards about ensuring trailers give you a truer picture of what the movie is really like (and not just a sting of action getting clips)making you believe the movie will be great so you go and regret every minute you wasted watching it along with the money you spent to get there. I personally would not recommend this movie to anyone.
1,Dragging,"very slow, storyline is weak, photography ok, acting ok, would not recommend wasting time unless it is free and you have time to kill."
2,Interesting but falls short,"It has an interesting movie, but as things go on it gets more unclear what's going on. It's supernatural or aliens? hard to say the movie never confirms it. The ending falls way short of what I was expecting.It's slow with a poor ending so dont think as it goes it will get better, it's not very well written. They make it out like it's a real story but it's pure speculation if that is true, the video would have never been let out from the CIA if it was true.We have heard many things rumors about stuff that is alien related in that part of the country with the sumerians etc... but this movie is not going to blow anyones skirt up. I give it 2 stars as the quality of the film is pretty good, just the plot sucks and doesn't sell what viewers are wanting to.Not very well written."
3,Disappointing,"meh. I kept waiting for this movie to pick up steam and ""get to the good part"", but it never happened. It did mention an interesting historical reference related to The Objective, that I will follow up on, but overall I was pretty disappointed."
2,Just a walk through the desert...,"Don't waste your time. The ending didn't explain anything for me. Maybe if you know a little about the ""myths"" they talk about in the movie you may find some entertainment in that, but even then the movie doesn't delve deep enough into the characters or plot for anyone to really care. Not to mention there was no action at all. The movie does move at a pace that kept me interested in seeing and learning more, but it was like they ran out of ideas... and money... and ended it abruptly. Ok if it were a made for TV series, and this was just part 1, but a horrible movie in a whole."
1,stupid deluxe,Boring and slow and stupid. If I could rate this movie a minus 5 I would! Do yourself a huge favor and watch something else.
2,Anticlimax,"I knew from the outstart this was a scifi. The first half of the film did draw me into ""What is the objective?"" and some good military action, but the second half was very tedious, repetitive and added virtually nothing new. The ending explained nothing and left me with the feeling I had just wasted about an hour and a half without any answers as to what the ending meant. Had the director cut out alot of the shootem up and led the viewer back to Langley, I'm sure this would have been a good segway to a new TV series. Otherwise, it took a dive over the cliff with Abdul."
1,What a horrible ending,This movie was engaging until it ended too fast. I have no idea what the ending was supposed portray. I wouldn't recommend it at all
2,Dafuq,"The movie is not that good.The journey to the end was *tolerable, but then you get to the end and it doesn't make much sense. I mean like was the guy dreaming the whole time or something, or did he get rescued. I'm not sure...If you're bored and you want a movie that does not make a whole lot of sense and you don't want to watch something that good than this movie is for you."
1,Tramatic,"What a tragic waste of talent. When I ordered this I thought it was a comedy. A comedy about a guy who travels the world and has two beautiful wmen after him. There is not way that it could possibly be boring,right? Except it is. It's slow and pointless. Everyone, including the dog, is clinically depressed and is in desperate need of therapy with the possible exception of Geena's character who is very unbalanced and stalks the male lead like Pepe la Pew throughout the entire movie. I suppose that she was supposed to be the breath of fresh air, but I found her delusions terrifying. The ending was unsatisfying, there was a strong clue that he was ready to change his mind again within minutes. I did get one really good belly laugh from this DVD when I went to the deleted scenes and saw that there were three screens of them. I'd been betting that they hadn't cut a frame. On this theme of traveling disfunctionals in love I vastly prefer the newer film ""The Very Thought of You."""
1,ZZZ...,"That is what I did in the theatre when I saw this movie. This movie is so thouroughly boring it makes Mr. Rogers look like Rambo. I hated this movie then and I hate it now, probably worse. My english teacher recommended that I see this and I can say now 13 years later NEVER go see any movie recommended by an english teacher. This movie is so psychotically confusing youll find youself repaeatedly going to the bathroom when you dont have to just to get some fresh air. Dont buy it-dont rent it."
4,"Overall, a nice interpretation of a great book","Anne Tyler is one of my favorite authors and Accidental Tourist one of my favorite books. I was a little anxious, though, about seeing this film. Tyler's characters are so very unusual, with little action and lots of reaction. Still, William Hurt and Geena Davis are all that was needed. William Hurt's dazed, bewildered appearance, Geena Davis's scary-odd Muriel. The movie is filled with moments of such emotional clarity that you are drawn into this romance between the remote gentleman and the oddball."
4,Easy to watch,"Everyone else has related the story of this film but I have a different interpretation about motivations. Macon's family of origin is upper-middle class but Very Peculiar and I think that is the reason he really falls for the Gina Davis character. She is also Peculiar. Kathleen Turner is so perfectly beautiful and perfect in every way and so is John Hurt as her husband. But Kathleen is always belly aching about him. I was vexed when I thought they were getting back together. However, I dont know why Geena Davis chose Macon; probably because he is a good provider and is good looking, the usual gambit. The boy is refreshingly not cute at all but of course, the dog is cute. Its a good movie. Macon's siblings adore the beautiful kathleen so, I wonder if he will lose his job and his family of origin due to leaving her in the lurch."
2,"Skip the movie, read the book","When I first saw this movie, I had already read the novel, and I still couldn't figure out what was going on. The plot is definitely confusing. Large sections are left out, understandable to a certain degree as there are limits to movie making, but, not only are certain subplots left out, important sections of the main plot are deleted as well. The result is a choppy, confusing, unpleasant film. The only slightly redeeming quality this film possesses is the fine acting of William Hurt, Gena Davis, and Kathleen Turner who struggle with a terrible script; however, I still don't recommend viewing this film.The novel is such an amazing piece of writing; please read it instead, or, at least, check out my review of the novel. END"
5,Accidental Tourist,"Sweet, funny, and heart warming. I really enjoy William Hurt's work. It is a movie the family can watch."
2,KEEP IT REAL,Cmon now i'm a krazy sick-o 3x fan but this dual committee iz garbage....keak & agerman r great artist but for sum reason jus can't find whutz really good 4 them....but i'm happy 4 agerman going gospel we all gotta repent one day ........but this dual iz not a great album let alon top 3 in 2000 datz a joke buddy whoeva wrote dat otha review......keak keep doin yo thang manne i will always support 3x muzik weither it rap or gospel rap......bart were r u manne??????
2,Basic and Boring,"I rather like the studio efforts that SCI has put out, however this record just bores me. The songwriting is very simplistic and I find it very hard to listen to the album all the way through. There are a couple of times that the songs seem to be about to go somewhere, but they just end. I'm not talking about ten minute jams, but just some sort of memorable hook or melody.This album will turn a number of songs into live anthems, maybe, but then again, most Cheese songs translate live much better than on record. I gave this two stars for a Cheese record, though nothing on here is actually bad, just unassuming. If you are new to SCI, you should probably start somewhere else. If you are an old fan, then save your money for a concert."
4,SCI Keeps it real...,"Upon listening to the first song and reading through the liner notes, I realized the songs are all under 5 minutes (or so). I thought that was odd. I listened to it, and didn't feel like it was lacking. I love the fact they let the songs stand alone. I think it is sometimes frustrating when a ""jamband"", comes out with an album that is just a bunch of jamming. Some ""jambands"" rely too much on their ability to play a song for 20 minutes, and put too little stock into the songs they are playing. Don't get me wrong I love a good jam, but it is refreshing to hear such a song based album from SCI. Love the songs, and hope they hit Atlanta soon!"
3,Good but not Great,"This album is nota true representation of how great cheese can be. if you are getting your first album, buy carnival 99 or string cheese incident live. their studio albums are not too special, but they are at their best live. this jambnad is for real."
3,What happened?,"It sounds like SCI has been slowly going downhill since Outside Inside- UTN was, with the exception of a few songs, pretty bad... then they give us- this? The lyrics sound forced to the music, there is very little groove feeling (it really feels like there dubbing the lyrics on top of pre-made music), they really do sound like there becoming just another mainstream pop band. very dissapointing."
2,Somewhat Dissapointing,"Although a good easy listening chill album, I don't think this album captures the true instrumental talent of the String Cheese Incident. I don't think there is one of these songs that I will actually look forward to seeing live. The only reason I give this album two stars is because I respect String Cheese and the music they make. They claim that this is supposed to be a more lyric driven album, but lets face it, string cheese is not known for their lyrics and these lyrics sound forced and cliche. Is this the String Cheese Incident or the Malcolm Burn Incident????"
2,You could call it a concept album....,"the concept being a band working as a democracy - which appears to be true - everybody gets their songs on this album and they're all given proper respect and placement. But what the album seems to lack is collective harmony - or a momentum that keeps your attention from song to song. Some of songs that were meant to be simplified by minimalist arrangements are left too bare to hide the weak vocal performances. And some of the lyrics.. (there are some that WILL make you cringe).. leave you wondering if democracy for the String Cheese Incident means saying ""good enough."""
2,I guess one would call this Soft Cheese.,"With the exception of a few of their more recent live albums, I have just about everything SCI has put out. I became a fan only relatively recently, but once I got one (starting with their collaboration with Kellar Williams), I got hooked and can't stop. But this album left me disappointed. It was slow and stripped down. As several have said before me, none of the jams, none of the joy, none of the humor, nor the can't-stop-moving musicality of basically every other release by these guys, whether live or in the studio. Everything else - ANYthing else- they've done is just better. Buy if you want to have a complete collection of their work, but if you're a first-time buyer, don't go here, because it's not representative of just how fantastic they are. Had this been the first album I got from them, I would not have bought more and would've missed the unbelievable experience I have every time I listen to virtually everything else they've done."
1,Garbage,Poor sound and video only makes this poorly made film even more painful to watch. I loved White Fang 1 and 2 so this was a huge disappointment. This isn't a Disney film. It is a cheaply made Italian film. Poor cliches and acting everywhere. I love many of the spaghetti westerns but this was horrible. I couldn't even sit through the whole film.
1,"Looks like vomit in a bowl, and my dogs HATE it!","I've got two dogs who will eat almost anything. I like to give them good, wholesome food and the increasing prices make it difficult. I purchased the Merrick Turducken as Merrick used to be a great company that made wonderful dog food that looked like human food. Not in this case! It looks, smells, and has the same appetizing effect on my dogs as if I'd thrown up in the bowl. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!! Neither of my dogs likes it and I'm stuck with an expensive case of food. My dogs both sniffed their bowls, then walked away. I'm feeding it to them as its bought and paid for, but I feel cruel doing so. They usually won't jump right into eating it, no matter how hungry they are. They do eat a little, but usually leave at least half in their bowl and that's so unlike them! Horrible dog food. Would never recommend to anyone. Looks disgusting and must taste the same the way my dogs are avoiding it."
3,Great Product but Terrible Packaging,"Short and sweet.....The product itself is top notch and my two GSD's love it. However, the last shipment looked like it was packaged by a three year old and thus it arrived via UPS with a can lid popped open spilling its contents over the other dented cans. Another case arrived seperately which was properly packaged using air pillows and was fine. Don't get sloppy Amazon. It will cost you customers."
5,merrick turducken if your dog loves human food then this is for them,"I have gone through several different kinds of dog food and this is so far the best. I have one rottweiler and two bichons and I thought they were going to have me for desert. I mix this with turducken dry dog food and they eat every bite, no more left dryed out food. I have this on subscription so my dogs get the best. It may be a couple of dollars more than the regular dog food but it is well worth the price. I have also ordered the other Merricks to try and I am hoping they like this just as much..."
2,A Voice Wasted,"I give this recording two stars because Kiri Te Kanawa's voice is truly beautiful but the arrangements of these ""traditional"" tunes is so insipid the singer's genius is wasted. Folk music is best when performed by folk, the way it was supposed to be, not ""arranged"" for a philharmonic orchestra with all its flouncy frills, so the singer's natural voice comes through expressing purely the emotion that makes this kind of music so beloved."
1,dual throttle body,"i love k&n to death but they have to realize ford was being super dumb when when they came out with straght six and made it dual throottle body and when i asked if if it fit my truck it said yes, and forgot about dual throotle body. but just gotta buy the aitr charger instead. but did return giot money back so was happy and ill still by k&n shuld specify better"
4,"Good, but not the best","This is a fine performance, plenty of highlights from Perlman. I found it a bit difficult to hear the orchestral detail. I'm anxious to hear Perlman's mid-1960's recording with Leinsdorf and the Boston symphony set to be re-issued January 2000. However, there are three other recordings out there better than this Sibelius. Nigel Kennedy on EMI, Cho Liang-Lin on Sony, and Vadim Repin on Erato all seem to capture the mystery and Scandinavian feeling of the piece a little more."
2,Drew's Famous First Dance Songs,"This is an average cd, however if you are looking for the songs to be recorded by the original artist I would recommend buying the artists' actual cd. The instrumental parts are too heavy and you can hardly hear the lyrics. The lyrics almost sound muffled."
1,Misguided,"The songs on this CD are not performed by the original artists, but rather by singers who do not sing very well. I was disappointed with the CD."
4,Financial shenanigans and excess destroy a racing dynasty,"At last a detailed explanation as to what caused the implosion of the seemingly solid Calumet Farms throughbred racing dynasty. How could things go so wrong, so fast? An interesting mix of human pettiness, ignorance and weakness, greed, and then the Farm was lost to greater and greater accelerating debt. Detailed portraits of many of the Calumet favorites, especially Alydar, who's accidental death stopped the cash machine that was keeping the farm afloat in a sea of debt. Interesting crosscurrents of bad feduciary management by the trust's bank managers, criminal activity, gangland ties, possible drug peddling for cash, contracts that were fast and loose and pledged the same assets over and over again. If you like racing and remember the Calumet lock on winning and its great horses, this is a fascinating book. If you are looking for just a ""horse"" book you should look elsewhere, but this is a great story from the get-go."
3,Too much financial mumbo-jumbo,"I purchased this book after reading ""Seabiscuit"" and expected to get the same type of biography. However, my enjoyment was hindered by Auerbach's excessive use of financial jargon regarding the Wright family's trust as well as the battles and litigations that ensued. I do have to commend the author for digging down into the nitty-gritty, though I did sometimes wonder about some of the finer details and their credibility. I'd recommend this book to anyone who really wants to know the story of Calumet Farm, as long as they don't mind drudging through pages and pages of boring and often confusing jargon."
3,Mostly Money,"What happened to Calumet makes for a great story.Ms. Auerbach gives myriad details of Calumet's accounting practices ..... money here, deals there. And there are plenty of notes and a very complete index, but there is limited information about the people involved.Why did the 16 year old heiress to the farm marry a local share cropper's son? And how did her wealthy, powerful family react at the time?This book paints a detailed financial picture of the deals that (likely) led to Calumet's fall. But there remain considerable back stories to be told."
3,This is an Awful Story,"If you like watching a train wreck, read this. It seems lightly written, and really gruesome when it comes to the part where Alydar gets exploited. I don't see why that crime was never solved. For that matter, the whole mess was just left hanging. Little detail and no conclusion, really. Just like the truth of the matter."
4,Sweet bluegrass with a mournful romantic edge,"Sweet, heartsong-heavy tradgrass, with several well-chosen cover tunes. These guys aren't the world's most dazzling or flashy musicians, but they hit the emotional content of these songs squarely on the head. The songs range from a straight cover of ""Wreck of the Old 97"" and Red Allen's ""Teardrops In my Eyes"" to country-based classics like Dallas Frazier's ""Fourteen Carat Mind"" and George Jones's ""Window Up Above."" A nice, unassuming album which has plenty of nice touches and solid picking throughout."
5,In The Company of Lautreamont,"This early 20th century psychonaut is the latest embodiment of the Poet Maudit, intuitively following the program set out by Baudelaire and brilliantly brought to fruition by Rimbaud and Lautreamont and added to substantially by the surrealists. It is, however, Michaux's connection to the author of Maldoror that draws me to him, and as in Ducassean texts, Michaux's writings reveal numinous monsters aplenty, strange landscapes, psychic flora and fauna that are noted, illuminated from all sides, catalogued in precise detail. A selection of the art is given as well. These are good to excellent translations, as noted in the previous review. The selection and chronology makes this book stand out over the New Directions standard that we've long depended on for our picture of Michaux."
2,No high contrast numbers on the fuses,There are no traditional raised white letters for easy identification of the fuse rating. You have to either know the color coding or hold the fuse at just the right angle to see the raised rating stamp. I gave them 2 stars because they seem to work fine.
4,"great for theorists, not for lazy sundays","Giddens' approach to theory takes functional-structuralism and gives it a diachronic facelift. One of the greatest flaws in structuralism (sorry LS) is that it does not address problems related to social change in context of time and place. Giddens' attempts to do this, albeit with a few flaws, but all in all is a sound theoretical base from which to pull from when creating models.Kind of repetitive at times, considering it is a collection of articles rather than one manuscript."
3,a great book for major m.j fans,Making HIStory is a great book for big M.J fans like myself. It has some briliant colour photographs but it is not exactley a litery classic. I does however have a great interview in it conducted by Adrian Grant. A not bad book all round but it is not one of the greatest M.J books around
3,photos shown are NOT in book!,"Sorry to say I was dissapointed in this book. I was thrown off a good bit too by the photos shown with the cover photo on the Amazon page. Those photos DO NOT appear at all in this book. It is a large format very thin 32 page book. The photos while wonderful subject...obviously since it's Michael, are not very new or unique images. There is a interview in it very short and spread through the book in very large print, not a in depth one at all. I suppose the photos are worth buying it but if you are looking for ones shown ,.,,they aren's there! The images are fairly clear but many are ""sepia"" which is a reddish type wash over them...I guess they thought this was effective. I personally didn't like it."
3,Good modal Jazz music...,"It worths buying this cd for the innovation.It seems that this girl was really honest with her music,music from the heart.But unfortunately,at least for me,the cd gets really boring after you listen the first tracks.It's pretty good to relax but the Jazz fans that like a more progressive sound like fusion may be a little disappointed with Alice's work. As a summary, buy it if you are seeking for something different,I am pretty sure that you will consider this cd a good choice ...and imagine that John Coltrane was listenning to this music every single day when he got home..."
5,Wonderful,"One day I noticed that I listen to Alice Coltrane more than I listen to John. This is interesting because I generally didn't like her playing with the Coltrane group.This session somehow balances moving group interplay with a truly peaceful, meditative feel. Pharoah Sanders, my favorite sax player, shows his more peaceful side on soprano which is often dismissed by fan and critics."
5,Meditate on this,"This is a must for anyone who seriously loves jazz and/or enjoys meditation. I heard Journey recently at a performance of the Alvin Ailey dancers. At the sound of the first few notes and sparkling percussion, I said out loud ""Oh my God; that's Alice Coltrane!"" It had been over 20 years since I last heard this music. It still takes me to another place."
5,Makes my mouth water!,"Our French Basset is not a finicky eater, in fact, she will eat almost anything she can get into her mouth. But, she has an allergic reaction to a broad range of ingredients commonly found in dog food; the result is we have relatively few choices of foods we can provide to her. Most of the dog food we can provide is reminiscent of unappetizing hospital food. Well, that is, until we found Merrick canned dog food. I suspect if you took some Merrick canned dog food out of a can, put it into a soup bowl and warmed it up, you could serve it and any human would happily eat it and ask for more. Needless to say, our dog loves it (as does my son's Australian Kelpie) and, having read the ingredients, we feel good about providing it to her. So far, over the last several months, we have served her Merrick's French Café and Cowboy Cook Out. Her health excels, there have been no indications of allergic reaction, she licks the bowl clean and we feel good about what we are feeding her."
1,My dogs won't eat it,"We love the Merrick lines of food to mix in with the Nature's Variety dried kibble. Our dogs simply turn their noses up at this food and will not touch it. They aren't normally fussy eaters. I have one who will eat whatever you put in front of him, but not this. We'll stick to Wing A Lings, Turducken and Smothered Comfort."
2,NO QUALITY ASSURANCE HERE,"PAIR OF CUFF LINKS I BOUGHT LOOKS VERY NICE ON PICTURE I LIKED THEM VERY MUCH BUT WHEN I RECEIVED THEM, THEY HAD VERY VISIBLE SCRATCHES ON ENAMEL AND THE STERLING SILVER FINISH AROUND ENAMEL WAS NOT TOO GREAT ALSO TAKES TOO LONG TO GET MY REFUND. TOO BAD BECAUSE I REALLY LIKED THEM. AFRAID TO BUY FROM THEM NOW."
5,Exceeded my expectations,"Superb!This is a highly detailed account of the evolution of boats & rafts into ships - lots of detail, drawing heavily on archaeological evidence, without any wild assumptions about the supposed shape of the boats.This is not a coffee table book, with lots of pretty pictures and large print, but a real source of up-to-the-minute detailed info for the scholar as well as the casual reader.What is especially good, is that each chapter is written by the leading expert in that field, using the latest available data and supported with lots of photos/drawings to illustrate points.However, this forces each chapter into a different written style and sometimes this comes across as a little 'heavy', but most are very fluidly written.I am very impressed with the content, layout, presentation and production of this series (I have 6 of the books so far) and I would recommend this in preference to other comparable books."
5,The Earliest Ships: The Evolution of Boats into Ships (Conway's History of the Ship),This is a good book and shows pictures of ships found how they were made.
3,Color #575,"The color is absolutely great (between coral & magenta, very saturated & bold), but I wanted to write a review because this is one of the top Revlon lipstick lines, and I thought the formula was terrible. I'm 23 years old and my lips are not chapped and are smooth & moisturized, but this lipstick collected in a strange way on my lips & made them look really wrinkly. None of my other lipsticks do that (Mary Kay, Maybelline, Clinique) so I am pretty disappointed. I would not recommend this formula, though I love the color.edit--- I contacted Revlon about the issue & they generously sent me this color in a different formula, which I like quite a bit better."
3,"Good, not great","Decent live performance, highlights are ""My Town"", ""Streets in the Rain"" and ""Feel Us Shaking"" but overall not nearly as good as Transmissions From The Sea of Tranquility which is the best live CD they have put out."
2,not original artists,the music is ok but the songs are not performed by the artists that made them famous. Be forwarned. They are performed OK but not as well as the originals.
5,great deal,"I just bought one of the books in this series for over 3 times as much ,so I am ecstatic! Shipping was fast, book is in perfect condition, couldnt be happier."
5,"Not perfect copies,but better than anything yet","I had several episodes of this show released by Alpha which were nearly unwatchable. This set from Timeless Is 100 times better.While the picture is scratchy, the audio is very good and have'nt seen any ""cuts"" in the video on any of the episodes. I highly recommend this set to anyone who likes this show. Step back into a time when doctors really cared about their patients and not their pocketbooks."
2,Gag me with a spoon,"This show is hideous....the one episode worth seeing is the one about cocaineotherwise....buyer beware, come to think of it Rod SErling and the Twilight Zone reaches the depths of this crap in many of the episodes....."
5,Best value for money. Easy to use.,"I bought the tripod and I found it great. I can use it with my camera and camcorder. Without much effort. It's easy to use, compact and not very heavy to carry.Great value for money"
1,"ALZIEE, the world's best hidden secret!","Probably the best female performer I've seen in 20 years. Alizee has everything, sultry voice, great style, sensusality, sexuality, innocence, beautiful form, eye contact, great song writers and music.I saw her in paris, France, Jan of 2004 and was blown away by her. She's hard to describe, but amazing is the closest word.You can almost feel the warth, love and affection she emits, as she sings or speaks live.I've never seen such an angelic person of this magnatude before, it's almost overwhelming. Her fans, 7 to 70 are mesmorized by who she is and stands for.She is so loved, you can almost taste it. She also cares very very much about her fans and has proved it, more than once in STARS A DOMICLE.Every song is 5 out of 5, so just Go buy it ,,,anD then find the vdeos and be ready to be addicted!"
4,Gourmandises,"...P>Gourmandises is really amazing, and I do not speak a word of French! There are only 2 songs I regularly skip, mostly because I find them boring, though not bad. It's pop/dance music, and highly enjoyable; great for blasting from car stereos and playing at parties. Alizee is very talented with a large range and great control over her voice. It helps that she's got some professional songwriters, but she's the artist, and she pulls all of these songs off very well.4 stars for the talent, the enjoyable songs, and the upbeat tempos. Loss of 1 star for 2 songs that were not up to par and for being so short.BEST TRACKS: Moi...Lolita, GourmandisesWORST TRACK: Mon Maquis"
5,fav french artist,This was one of my favorite albums for a long time discovered it on the internet and decided that I liked it. Used to listen to it all the time. I purchased this CD years ago and I am not finnaly writting a review. This is the only french artist that I listen too. So that makes her my favorite lol.
5,Hot Young French Singer Knocks My Socks Off !!!!,"Gourmandises is one of the few albums where I loved every single track and I don't speak a word of French. Alizee is an amazing young singer and, if you're trying to expand your music horizons beyond American shores, you should give her a try. You'll never guess she's a teenager. She has such a depth and richness to her voice. As I write this, I'm listening to her new album, Mes Courants Electriques, and it's just as hot as Gourmandises."
5,"The Ghosts of Poetics, Poetics of Ghosts","Alan Shapiro has, in this volume, created a world where, for better or for worse, the past is not missing: instead, it walks around in our world, befriending us or pestering us, stopping at nothing, even death. And yet these are poems of loss, or loss that will not complete itself, as in Joyce's ""absence is the highest form of presence.""Take the poem ""Ghost,"" in which a dead woman speaks to her widower: even the past is haunted by its own past. Or the poems of or to the speaker's dead or dying relatives & loved ones: the touches that have ended in withdrawn hands but remain in lingering feeling.Shapiro's knowledge of poetry is astounding, & he uses that knowledge (which is, by the way, so much more than mere knowledge) to build subtle, strong, and elegant poetry. He has been doing it for years; his earlier work--excellent as it is--is mere exercize for the power of The Dead Alive and Busy."
1,Ok,Damn thing won't stay in your ear. Makes it difficult to carry on a conversation when it keeps falling out of the ear. Maybe if I put a magnet or tape to my head it might be better. A complete waste of money!
1,doesn't work,"doesn't work with my kyocera.as for the rat thing above, yeah, if i was a rat I guess I'd be using my headset alot, too."
5,Nothing wrong here,"This is the perfect earpiece for the 8260, 3360, and 8265. It sounds fine, the mic works well, and it has the answer/hangup button inline with the cord. A little expensive yes, but it's great for driving and the earbud isn't too big, unlike some other Nokia models."
4,Great earbud overall,"I really like the convenience (very light and folds up easily) and quality of this earbud. The only drawback is that it sometimes makes an annoying buzzing sound. This can be mitigated by twisting the plug around (go figure) or moving the phone around -- kind of like trying to pick up a radio station. It's not as inconvenient as it sounds, but it's something to be aware of. The volume and quality of sound (when there's no buzzing) is really impressive, and the microphone picks up my voice very well even when I'm driving and twisting my head around to keep an eye on traffic."
3,Doesn't fit phone connection :(,Headset adapter doesn't fit in the phone connection.Bought two and still don't have a headset for my cell phone.
1,Money's Worth,"My wife and I recently upgraded phones to the Nokia 6555. As usual the headsets from the old Nokia's wouldn't operate in the new ones. After researching prices for the exact (supposedly) Nokia earbub headsets, we settled on two of these sets. Shipment was FAST, however neither worked in either of the phones. I think we paid $2.95 each, with shipping it was around $ 17.00. I did'nt even bother to return them ( I should have), but I just figured that we nearly got our money's worth. Next time I will go for the higher priced set."
2,Finally found ear piece for Nokia,"I finally found an ear piece for my 2 year old Nokia phone. However, the ear insertion doesn't stay in my ear and constantly falls out. So, I'm using my hand to keep the ear piece in my ear. Also, hearing volume is not effective. Annoying, but can't do anything about it.However, I've discovered you can find stuff on Amazon and that's a good thing."
4,"Pretty nice, and better than the others....","I bought this earbud as an upgrade to the earbud which came with my AT&T,Nokia 8260. I also bought the Jabra earbud - to compare both. This earbud works quite well. Compared to the Jabra the sound quality going into as well as coming out of this earbud is a little less clear. However, the major advantage of this earbud is that it doesn't pick up as much annoying wind noise or any of that rustling clothes noise. This earbud is sensitive enough but, not to sensitive to be obnoxious. I kept this earbud - It works well enough and is comfortable enough. The other though it comes with an assortment of ear ""gels"",is just to complicated and surprisingly uncomfortable for it own good."
5,Great Sound Quality Headset!!!,"I got this headset as part of the package for my 8260 and I'm definitely happy.It's a necessary product when driving especially with easy to use hang-up boutton on the mic.It's very light and comfortable.The earphone has good sound output, and the mic picks up sound very well....."
5,This item is awsome!,"It must have saved me a couple of times while driving and trying to talk on the phone or answer a call.Also, the law here is it's illegal to drive while talking on the phone so it saves you from some dumb tickets.Being 29.99, it's a bit expensive, for a mic, earbud, and mini plug. You have to be careful not to stretch the wire, as you can break the fragile thin cables inside the rubber jacket, which should have been less streatchy."
5,Outstanding!!!!,"This is the single best accessory I have found for my 8290. I use my phone all day long, and have tried many other brands and styles of ear pieces. The quality and comfort of this earpiece beats the others hands down."
4,Great headset,"This headset works great with my Nokia 2610. It plugs in easily and has good voice quality. For me, it is the same as if I were talking on my cell phone without the headset. The price is great and I got one for my husband's phone too."
4,I relived excellent memories of childhood travels in the car,"Being raised in the midwest, and traveling through Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin where they seemed to be on the roadside every 20 miles, our family used to read them and then one of us would have to try to come up withour own. We came up with some good ones of our own. I recommend this book to anyone who traveled and enjoyed these pieces of Americana."
4,Old memories,"I read this book 40 years ago, I'm glad I found a copy of it for my library. I still get a tickle out of it."
5,I Remember This,"The verse by the Side of the Road is something I remember from childhood. We lived in West Texas and when we traveled, the Burma Shave signs were our only form of entertainment since there really isn't much to see in the desert.I had to buy this book for my daughter since I'd tried to tell her how much fun looking for the signs had been.I knew beforehand what the book was like because it was the second one I have purchased from Amazon."
5,the verse by the side of the road,BEST EVER!!!!!!! BOOK ARRIVED IN PERFECT CONDITION (NEW) TWO DAYS FROM WHEN ORADER WAS PLACED! ******** 5 STAR PLUS!
2,OK sound but they rusted!,"I put them in a steam room, right? Makes sense? It took about 4 months and they started to rust. Gross."
5,great reading,"this writing by Diasaku Ikeda, are short excerpts on the subject at hand.Well written for all people, most especially Nichiren Buddhist, SGII enjoyed this book very much."
5,Wonderfull,"Lovely!! it is all I needed: simple, easy to read, perfect for the ""one page per day"". Its presentation makes it ideal for a gift. I not only has Ikeda's thoughts, it also has reflections about ""Determination"" taken from famous people. I encourage you to get the whole ""Buddhism For You series""."
4,Buy the remastered reissues instead !,"""Stormy Weather"" and ""Gone With the Wind"" are remastered reissues of ""Live at the Jazzhaus"" Vols. 1 & 2 (1965). Along with ""The Jeep is Jumping"" (also 1965) they constitute Webster""s best later work after having moved to Europe. The reissues have a much better sound than the ""...Jazzhaus"" volumes. The program includes many of the standard ballads associated with Webster. There is never a dull performance. Webster, like Ellington, just kept getting better with age. Webster plays with one of the leading bands in Europe at the time, the Alex Riel Trio comprised of Kenny Drew on piano, Alex Riel on drums and the amazing Nils Henning Orsted Penderson on bass."
5,You have to read this book,I wish I knew about this book back in High School. The Kinsey Report should have been required reading. This book begins with common misconceptions and a test about sex. Surprised by a less than perfect score I read the book cover to cover. The Kinsey Report is an A to Z book on sex and sexual health.
1,Hatred,I hate the people who make this book. I would be willing to bet that they help child molester molest children. Even give them freedom to do so. The creepiness about transgender children is worse. I am willing to bet that doctor money has done some really illegal stuff in order to prove his research is real. Like secretly changing a boy twin and girl twins gender cause the boy gets adopted changed to girl and boy is a girl now. Rumors of this bizarre theory of his has caught my ears before. That parents influence is why it didn't work. So he did it secretly to prove that this was possible. Doctor money is the worse one of them all a real creeper.
1,Christian Evangelical propaganda produced by zealots.,"Looking for an arithmetic video for your children? THEN DON'T BUY THIS VIDEO! Much to our surprise and disappointment, ""Rev-Up for Arithmetic"" turns out to be an evangelical Christian video! It is full of references to Jesus, to God giving his only son to us, and so son, and is rife with Christian symbols. The Amazon description of this video gives absolutely no indication of its religious orientation (or perhaps ""disorientation"" would be more appropriate). It is truly pathetic that the producers of this technically flawed and otherwise boring video have to resort to subterfuge to get their religious message out. It is an insult to Amazon and to its customers. They owe us an apology. I don't blame Amazon for this, since only by watching this video would one know about its true intentions. A better name would be ""Rev Up for Brainwashing""."
1,Article is half page long..,"Total rip off... pay $1.50 and you get 3 paragraphs of text, with general knowledge."
2,"""Blacks will have the priesthood in the Millenium""","Yes, Bro. Bruce did write those words in his first couple editions of this book. Just goes to show that anytime a person adds in more than the Standard Works, what you get is nothing more, or less, than that person's opinion. If you want some truly interesting uninspired writings, read the Apocrypha instead."
2,"Good, but unfortunately altered from earlier editions","This book is an excellent resource for those interested in what Mormons think on various topics. Unfortunately the later editions have been edited to not reflect the Mormon churches view of white racial superiority. Earlier editions of this book as well as the Book of Mormon and Pearl of Great Price and Journal of Discourses speak of whites as being the ""chosen seed"" and the blacks as being the ""seed of cain."" The Book of Mormon also speaks of dark skin as a curse(see 2 Nephi 5:21-23) that was pronounced upon the American Indians to make them loathsome to the mormon god's ""white and delightsome people."" The reader of this book would do good to look for a copy of an earlier edition as well to compare and see the way the Mormon church tries to hide some of its less favorable teachings from potential converts. All in all, the book is worth the money for a good general reference on the subject of ""Mormon Doctrine"""
4,Good book,It's a great book for those who want some Bruce R action. The one I received wasn't in that great of condition. So I took it upon myself to make it a project and I made it a hardback cover. Love the words of Bruce R though!
1,Misleading title: Should be false Mormon Speculation,"This book is well intended but frankly an appalling false oppinion of what LDS Doctrine is. Being so comprehensive, I can understand why some people read it, but since it's first publication it has been unauthorized and full of errors. It's one thing to write a book of opinion on religion but this so badly misrepresents the doctrines of the faith, I wouldn't represent it to anyone, whether they are Mormon or not. If you are Mormon, you will be riduculed if you quote it and if you are not Mormon, you will not get an accurate portrayal of official doctriine. If you want a good substitute that more accurately defines LDS Doctrine but still in a scholarly way, I'd suggest you check out the ""Encyclopedia of Mormonism."""
2,Too Zealous..,"He titles his book ""Mormon Doctrine"" and then goes on to explain that this is his personal study of Mormon doctrine. I don't like the author, I don't like the material, I don't find it helpful, I find it long, drawn out, confusing, bigoted in many areas. His style is to set the record straight on everything he can think of. I give it two stars as opposed to one because he actually references his words.If I were Mormon, I would give it a higher rating. This is a book for Mormons who are already ingrained in the faith. It will be of no help to investigators or the just plain curious."
4,"Interesting thoughts, but not exactly church doctrine","Though this book has a lot of interesting thoughts and insights it is not the approved doctrine of the church. Most of it is just the author's humble opinion and speculation on certain subjects.In my opinion this is not a completely accurate view of what the Mormons believe because most of it was Elder McConkie's express opinion. Most of the things discussed in that book are very trivial and if you asked an average ""church-going Mormon"" they would tell you that they don't know and it isn't taught but there opinion is such and such. If you really want to understand our beliefs, talk to the missionaries and read the Book of Mormon."
1,Anything but holistic,I was recently diagnosed with colon cancer. I know the limits of Western medicine and am interested in how western technology can be augmented with more holistic approaches. There may be value in Native American Medicine but this author doesn't reveal it to me. I don't care about his journey as a doctor; I found his narrative if it a waste.I am wondering as I write this whether a story-teller as weak as the author real comprehends the power of story-telling. I made it part way through the book and then spot checked the rest looking for a place of calmness. I never found one.I will look elsewhere.
5,A flexable blade of grass in a forest of brittle sticks,"As more and more of us in the medical profesion start to learn from our ancestors; and more importantly, as we start to listen to our clients and ourselves, I have a feeling that we will hear more about this book. Maybe we will read more from the author as we let him know that he is not alone.Kevin Bethel MD CM"
5,Coyote Medicine,"I loved this book. It should be required reading for all Doctors and anyone in the medical field. It is more about faith and community than medicine as it is practiced today. It shows there is more to healing than taking a pill or having surgergy, there are a lot of alternative ways of healing. This is about one mans struggle to follow his path in life but it's far from boring. A very good read."
5,A spiritual journey.,"Lewis' experience made me aware of my need to align myself with life. I now visit a Shaman. White man's therapy simply strings a person along until they either run out of money or insurance. Bear, my Shaman, gets right to the point. Lewis made me aware that I had this option."
5,Wealth of information for all people Native or not,This book comes from a veiw that is very seldom seen in a person combining modern technology with his born heritage. He makes it seem like you are right there with him all the way through the whole experience of his life and modern practice. It is a must read for anyone who is studying Native American beleifs and culture.
1,Fraud!,This product delivered was not what was advertised. It is a watered down version of the full strength product. Even the pump that was in the picture was not functional. I would be very careful purchasing anything from this vendor. It is an imitation - and not a good one at that!
1,Vitabath Original Spring Green Shower Gelee,"I had a sample of this many years ago and I thought it smelled wonderful, but it is expensive. Now that I can afford it, I decided to treat myself.Well, it did not smell wonderful at all. The smell was so disagreeable, I couldn't use it. What Happened? Did you change the formula, or is it me?"
2,Too strong,The pine scent of this gel is too strong for me. I guess it reminds me of dog shampoo. I threw it out.
3,Paul Sebastion,My husband has used this product for many many years and just loves it. So do I. But it was not as strong this time.
2,Forget it.,"I bought this book thinking i'd learn how to see auras and use these great gifts. Yet when I finished the book I was even more confused about these subjects more than I was before. This book is way out of date, with hard to understand information. The aura reading section states it may take several years to fully see the aura, and i'm not suprised he says this with the exercise he gives. It can give you little insight, but unless you want to learn what they thought and knew about this stuff around the 30's, FORGET IT."
3,Adrien Brody's acting debut is also his first starring role,"HOME AT LAST (TV-1988) is an hour-length family movie that features 15-year-old Adrien Brody in his first screen appearance.Set around 1900, Brody is Billy, an orphan kid plucked from the streets of one of NYC's roughest areas by a government relocation program and sent via train to Nebraska for adoption by Swedish immigrant farmers. His new family sees the boy as a surrogate for their recently deceased son, but Billy refuses to go along with this, which leads to conflict.Balance of the cast of this made-for-TVer are unknowns, or actors who've had bit roles in a few motion pictures.""Home at Last"" is also available on an off-brandDVD."
3,Flying without soaring,"3 1/2Jamal's special phrasings and delivery sounds more suited for searing solos than sacred songwriting, and a short length only confirms a need for more depth in order to be the classic I was hoping for. But without high expectations, early accessible post-bop rarely sounded as authentic."
2,old,I paid $10 for a map that was made in 2004. I had to pay as much for shipping as I did for the map. I could have gone to Walmart & bought a newer map for $5!!!!!!
3,just ok,"took the test and then I got this book, I failed the speed section of the test but and the book will not prepare you for that part, but it will be help you in the other areas of the test. Over all it will help but may not help you pass. The test is all about the speed and comprehension"
4,Product Manager's Handbook,"Information was helpful however it was very general. As a new product manager I was able to gather enough general information to formulate some idea of how product management is received in organizations. Based on other books I have read this is probably the best one to provide you with that general information. Again, this book is not for the advanced Product Manager."
4,Good Reference Handbook for Newcomers,"The Product Manager's Handbook is a good, general introduction to the subject. The concepts are explained clearly. The book gives a good description of the different steps it takes to transform ideas into commercially viable products and the skill set expected from a performing product manager. The critical financial side of product management, however, deserves more space than only 8 pages in a 290-page book dedicated to the product manager. At the end of the day, a product manager must show the money. Otherwise, the products will be ""killed"" sooner or later."
3,Not a complete guide,"Better than the field guide, you need only one. A good start but disappointing in it's depth and detail. A beginners guide but certainly not a complete guide."
3,Smooth and relaxed 70's grooves,"The track ""Seasons"" on Eighteenth Street Lounge Soundtrack brought this band to my attention. A smooth and relaxed 70's groove which reminded me of Funk Inc. back in those days. On Fusa Riot you will find lots more of these grooves, ideal for sipping your whisky late at night. A minus of this album: a bit too much of the same. I mean, the flute is annoying me sometimes when I pay real attention to it. But for lounging and relaxing this album is perfect."
4,The Best,This is the best holster on the market for the samsung 8500/850. My phone never comes dislodged from it. Phone is easy to get out of it as soon as you hear it ring. I had the leather case with the swivel clip but it sucked. If you need a holster make sure you buy this one!
3,Awesome for a month!,"The belt clip worked as great as the other reviewers claim. It held my Samsung SCH850 phone within easy access and it never popped out unexpectedly or fell off of my belt. It was nice to have a holder that fit my phone perfectly.However, after a month of normal use, the plastic clip broke off while walking for no apparent reason. My phone fell to the ground but it withstood the beating (thankfully!)Despite this setback, I'm going to give this clip another try. I'm hoping it was just a fluke that this one clip was made poorly. I'll update my review again depending on my next clip!"
4,Very good product with just one flaw,"This is a great product. I should know. I have bought four or five. The only problem with the product is that due to my carlessness, I end up breaking the holster. I forget to take it off when I sit in a chair. Many times the clip will catch on the side of the chair and then break off. I love the holster for convenience. It is very easy to use and the phone fits very snugly. I recommend it. Just don't forget to take it off before sitting down in a chair."
1,Piece of Junk,"Works fine for 3 days then breaksIf you wear the phone all the time, go in and out of chairs and cars, or do anything physical this will break."
5,Only buy Samsung accessories!,"... The authentic Samsung holster clip is strong and sturdy. But the imitation that Sprint sells costs the same as the original, except that it is noticeably inferior.I definitely recommend this holster to all Samsung SCH-8500 owners."
1,Samsung Belt Clip Holster- Poor Quality,Worked great for one month...then clip snapped off when on my hip and I was getting into my car. Poor quality...would not purchase again.
3,Not very durable,"This is the best style of holders I've seen, however, I have gone through 2 in the past year because they have broken."
4,Not a problem as of yet,I have had this holster for just about a month now and haven't had a problem with it. The phone detatches easily once you find the proper way to do it. I like the extra space between the holster and the battery as I have an add-on attached to the battery for a dash-mount in my car. The previous holster I had did not accomodate this. I will say that I am a bit disappointed that pin that allows the clip to function does not run all the way through the clip. It appears as though it might fall out in the future.
5,Awsome,"This is a great product!!! With a great grip!! Easy to use with easy release. I have tryed leather casses but they are to bulky and it get anoying trying to but it on the belt, its just terible!! I highly recommend it!!! Just no Questions asked! And you just can't beat the price!!! What are you waiting for!!!!"
1,dissapointing,"it is NOT a biography. It is a bounch of events glued together. At times I felt lost because she jumps from one topic to another and makes the reader confused when she throws a few strange sounding names without explaining who they were. As for the research of the subject I can't comment on the french part, however, on the polish side, the author didn't do a whole lot research because she couldn't even spell the name of an ex-King of Poland correctly! It's Stanisaw Leszczyñski, not Stanislas Leczinski!!! She also undermines the linguistic abilities of the readers, thinking maybe that no-one but the French can really figure out the french language. I would not recommend this book if you really want to learn something about Voltaire and his love life, because there was no love life in that book!!"
5,"The book that inspired ""A Visit From Voltaire""","The hilarious modern comedy featuring the Ghost of Voltaire returning to the 21st century, ""A Visit From Voltaire""Visit from Voltaire, Acites this book as one of the main sources for the period spanning the love affair of Madame de Chatelet and the King of the Englightenment, Voltaire. Another book that updates this information is Passionate Minds by David Boganis,Passionate Minds: The Great Love Affair of the Enlightenment, Featuring the Scientist Emilie du Chatelet, the Poet Voltaire, Sword Fights, Book Burnings, Assorted Kings,but this is the book that hooked me first. And it remains one of the best books to date, despite a few little hitches in her facts, for readability, entertainment and capturing the spirit of Voltaire's middle years. Anybody who reads it will finish with a wonderful understanding of the man's energy, resilience and courage. A must."
3,"Voltaire in Love: Definitely, Maybe","This book is an exercise in erudition-it's too bad Nancy Mitford is brilliant at that. I bought 'Volatire in Love' expecting to be thrust in a world of soirees, lasciviousness and all things French bound together by the magic of literature-something that M.V. Llosa does effortlessly with Gaugin in 'A Way to Paradise'-only to find that I was dealing with an author and a subject with a tendency to fall in love with their own prose. Maybe it was my expectation that let me down, but then again it may not have been me."
1,Una desilusión,"Compré este artículo pensando en encontrarme con todo un trabajo de investigación en linguistica, etc y es apenas un articulito de dos páginas, con poca información que no sea conocida ya. No lo recomiendo."
1,Garbage,Ive been using these attachments for years but this is the last one I'm going to buy. They never last more than 2 months but they are very easy to find and very cheap that's why I kept buying them. Thank goodness for the magnetic guards I found out about from another barber. They are expensive for guards but they work great and are very durable. So long speed o guides lol....
3,work good for bald fades,"These work good on the Andis masters but you have to use the fade master blade. the only problem is you have to be careful when putting this guard on because the teeth are very easily broken, proper installation is important."
5,Long Lost Beauty,"Life is strange;just a few days ago I was listening to Chris Hillman's ""Like a Hurricane"" (great CD by the way) and I thought about ""She is a Song""and what a beautifully produced piece it is. Now here it is finally available on CD. I have the LP which I wore out long ago; while I am happy to see it on CD the import price is very steep. Please A&M how about a domestic re-release of this and ""Windmills"". I often wondered why the ""cool"" original production style on ""She is a Song"" was never really tried on anything else I know about. The songs jump off the vinyl and grab you. If you're out there Rick I hope this time around these songs get the recognition they have long deserved."
4,Fun stuff,"Epic hadn't much of a clue about what to do with Jane Morgan after signing her. She certainly wasn't a rock singer, had a supperclub style and Contiental mentality, was too dramatic and glamorous for the teen crowd, too sophisticated for adult buyers. The ultimate solution were these albums of covers, in turns ridiculous in choice, amusing in execution and delightful in experience. They proved Morgan could sing Anything with a capital A and make it her own. Both albums sold big, to Epic's surprise and delight, and Morgan is the reason why. She was never above doing a song, but when she did a song she did it her way. These albums still are great listening."
3,Morgan covers hits by others in CD set,"There is nothing subtle about Jane Morgan's vibrato-filled vocals, especially in this collection of 22 pop hits. Morgan, a Julliard-schooled soprano, starts off with an over-the-top, organ thumping version of Side by Side, an overdramatic My Heart Belongs to Daddy and an uncharacteristically upbeat These Boots are Made for Walkin. The premise of these two albums, which were originally released in 1965 and '66, is to present the hits of others in ""my style"" and with ""fresh flavor."" She does do this indeed and at times it has you yearning to hear the original just one more time."
2,Sequel Album to a Great Album is always a danger!,"Music industry seems to like to bet on 'the formula of success' and even artists seem to follow this dangerous track.Lalo Schifrin was the creative arranger and composer of one the classic albums in the 60s which combined Jazz with Baroque and Renaissance Music. A quite inspired combination with the best musicians in the place in an album which is still available here @Amazon ('The Dissection and Reconstruction of Music ... as a tribute to Marquis de Sade' on Verve Records, produced by Creed Taylor).Now this sequel album has not achieved the same degree of inspiration though Schifrin could count on great musicians like Ray Brown and Grady Tate."
5,Sophisticated Swing!,"Montrealer Oliver Jones is still something of a secret to jazz fans who love piano/bass/drums playing. His many great albums for Justin Time are always rewarding, always beautifully recorded, always just the tonic for smooth quiet evenings (by the fire in winter or on the porch enjoying a late summer night's breeze). Obviously influenced by another exceptional Montrealer (Oscar Peterson) and by the beauty and simplicity of Bill Evans, Jones has always played with a lyrical sense of space and a perfectionist's devotion to melody and structure. Just In Time is a two-disc retrospective of his best work for this prime indie jazz label and the logical starting points for those into simply recorded yet immensely rewarding jazz. Recommended and essential."
4,Touching Yet Fun,"This is the first Anne Lamott book I have read. She has a unique, yet relatable, take on God and faith that I could appreciate. I will definately buy her newest book."
5,Couldn't put it down....,"She writes like we speak...true... deep to the soul and no holds barred.....I loved her honesty and incredible humor. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially someone who has their priorities in the wrong places. She gives you a dose of real life, painful as it is... her outlook opens our awareness of what's important and what to put aside. This is a book I would buy to add to my collection."
4,Honest and Insightful Little Book,"I have to hand it to Anne Lamott for being honest with herself and her past. She is a Christian and her growth is shown in this book as she discusses family, friends and raising her son Sam. The first quarter of the book may be disturbing for some with its graphic description of the author's drug and alcohol problems, but by the end of the book, the reader has developed a certain respect for Lamott and her insights into life born from her past. She is a woman comfortable with herself, her faults and her relationship with God, although she is well aware that she is far from the person that God believes she can become. The best reason to read this book, however, is not necessarily for the stories, but for her writing style. Lamott is a gifted writer. She believes in her faith and in her writing, both of which shine through in this short book."
3,Traveling Mercies: Some Thoughts on Faith,"I, too, feel that this book is more about finding oneself than about finding faith in religion. It was obvious from Ms. Lamott's experiences that she had a lot of grief in her life, but that only made me feel like I was reading about a real person; someone to identify with. And, as she grew older, she came to terms with her problems. I felt the book was an honest account, painting a true picture of Anne Lamott. I also found it funny - in some parts I actually laughed out loud - and a little sad at times, too. It was well worth the read."
5,You either love her or you hate her,"It's amazing that all the reviews of this booke either seem to be five stars or one star. Lamott is apparently a polarizing figure and her style of writing is perhaps a bit conversational and informal for many. However, I found her to be one of the more genuine and unabashedly honest writers I've ever come across. She tells it like it is, and that has always, and will always, ruffle many feathers. You go Annie! Who else would take a break from a prayer to flip off a fellow motorist? I suppose you call that an authentic centrist."
4,Great Read For All But The Far Right,"What a refreshing way of approaching religion in general, and Christianity in particular: through the eyes and experience of an ordinary person. As a minister I get so weary of all of the top-down preaching. This is a wonderful person-to-person sharing of faith. I'm glad I found Lamott and have already begun reading another of her offerings."
5,Painfully honest,"Anne Lamott is a single mother, former addict and alcoholic, and a believer. We couldn't be more different. But I loved this book: her tales and struggles, how she has become part of a community of believers without a lot of dogma and fanfare. I loved the descriptions of people in her church and how they help each other, her concerns and deep love for her child, and the losses she's been through. I am astonished that, given her background, she has written books that can be so helpful to others. Like her earlier book, BIRD BY BIRD, this one inspires and teaches through her human fears and doubts.I would recommend this to writing students because Lamott demonstrates how writing about the details of your life in your own voice can make even the simplest events compelling and interesting.~~Joan Mazza, author of DREAM BACK YOUR LIFE; DREAMING YOUR REAL SELF; WHO'S CRAZY ANYWAY? and 3 books in The Guided Journal Series with Writer's Digest Books."
2,Conflicted,"This book has some amazingly well written passages, especially the one that describes her father's condition at the end of his life. I am a writer and a follower of Christ, so this book left me conflicted as to what to think of it because of how flippant she is with the name of Jesus. At one point she talks about wondering if Jesus would want to drink a bottle of gin, and although there are probably a lot of you reading this who think ""So what?"", it really angered me that she claimed to be a follower of Christ but then threw his name around in disregard. She also says that she supports abortion theoretically and politically, and again if she is a true follower of Christ she would know how much he loves children and would never want to harm them, no matter how young they may be. There were several passages in this book that really inspired me to write, but all in all in this book she really is centered on herself to a fault."
2,Not what I was expecting....,"I am almost done with this book....but reading it has not been the experience I had thought it would be. I realize that this book is about her travels towards faith and that is a uniquely individual thing, but I am really struck by how self-involved the author is...her brand of Christianity seems solely to be how can God enhance her life and the life of those she loves. It all revolves around how finding God has improved her life...with nothing about what God requires of her. I don't consider myself Christian in the born again sense but I was certainly raised in a Christian manner...by parents who volunteered in a million different ways in order to serve God and those less fortunate. Why doesn't Anne Lamott put down the pen and go work in a soup kitchen? She definitely writes well and I enjoy her style, but she needs to get outside her head!"
1,Poster Child for the ME ME ME Generation,"Easily, the WORST book I have ever read. Annie Lamott is the most self-absorbed person in print. Even Gore Vidal, a great writer but one of the world's most arrogant people, writes in his memoir about events in his life from a worldly point of view, as opposed to Lamott's self-saturated me me me point of view.I have been a regular reader of Lamott's. Given that three of her last four books are all about HER, and given that each one is increasingly more self-absorbed and self-pitying, I am not about to pick up another one of her books ever again. Her fixation on herself is getting tired and boring.(Here's a radical idea: Nobody CARES about your dreadlocks, Anne!)"
1,Disappointing,"I found Lamott to be selfish and reckless, beyond the blame of her upbringing and surroundings. I did not find this book to be entertaining, rather a waste of time and a frustrating experience reading about a self-serving and self destructive individual."
4,pretty good book,I read this for book club and it was an okay read. The author does a nice job and the book is interesting.
4,A Great Read for Anyone,"Anne Lamott has a gift for telling stories that few authors have. I was a bit apprehensive about reading a book on faith and religion, but Lamott's ability to relate her religious experience into everyday language made this book a joy to read. I would recommend it for anyone, religious or not."
5,Traveling Mercies: Some Thoughts on Faith,"Loved this book, love the author. She is so open and honest in her life's assessments. It's not easy being Anne, yet she is willing to share her life with all of us. I write poetry and Anne LaMott has inspired me to write several. If you love to read, and,especially if you love to write, you will thoroughly enjoy this book. I very seldom laugh out loud when reading a book, but with her sense of humor you can't help yourself. She makes you laugh, cry and muse--all in the same book, no less."
5,Sisters in Christ,"Being a Christian, I was prepared to dislike this book. I thought Anne Lamott was ""christian"" as opposed to Catholic or Jewish or Muslim. I was wrong. She is a true sister in Christ who struggles with her faith and her obedience to God just as I do. We travel in completely different spheres, I'm a politically conservative, married, 2 kids, theologically conservative, soccer mom (OK, not soccer, piano lessons) kind of Christian. And I loved this book. Anne writes honestly about Christ's pursuit of her; and in turn, her own pursuit of a godly life. Her thoughts on grace are profound and I find myself meditating on various passages. God has used her words to work in my life and I'm thankful for her obedience in sharing them."
1,THE WORST BOOK EVER,You definitely have to be a baby boomer to appreciate the colloquialisms used throughout the book. A generation x'er just won't get half the book.
1,"More from Lamott on ""The Wonder of Me""","God save us from sanctimonious and self-absorbed people like Anne Lamott. Me, me, me, me, and more about me...and what do you think about me. That's the collected works of Lamott. I wish she'd shut up for a while and and ponder pride as one of the seven deadly sins."
5,The best of my summer reads!,"This book is about nothing at all -- but everything that is important. Lamott has special eyes to see the exquisiteness of grace in our everyday lives. And when I finished the book, her special eyes had rubbed off on me. Life seems freer, fresher... Ann reminds me that God is, indeed, at work in our lives. Her ability to capture the special in the mundane is a rare gift, and I just couldn't get enough of it."
3,Heart-warming book,"One of the best books about faith, this is not preachy in an off-putting way. Rather, Lamott's honesty and humanity prove heart- and soul-warming."
2,Irrereverant and Self-Absorbed,"I bought this book hoping to be inspired and moved. At times I was. Mostly, however, I was disappointed in the liberal agenda Anne Lamott seems to have. Anyone who disagrees with her is 'homophobic' or a 'Right-Winger'. Is she any better by labeling people this way? No. I don't think so. Her introspection is limited, or maybe it is too intense. She has a very shallow view of the world. Loving only those who love in return, hating anything Republican, avoiding Fundamentalist Christians as though they are all rabid vermin. I was disappointed with her limited vision and her quasi-intellectualizing of the Christian faith. I'm sure she is a beautiful person and I feel sorry for her. I believe her intentions were truly good in writing this book. I wish she had been less vague and 'transcendental' in her approach."
5,The one book we all should read...,"...Lamott gives us so much in these various snapshots on her journey(s) to her faith...it seems as if she was ""bottoming"" out and in the worst condition(s)--the drugs, the booze, bleeding from evisceration--she was able to align with her spirituality. Some may say that her use of language is kind of coarse, but lessons and thoughts like the one gained when she was in one of her Dewar's binging phase and she asked a friend what Christianity is like--the pawn shop analogy--(that one I found myself misty about) are simply priceless. We should feel grateful that Lamott is so real in these essays and testimonials. It gives quite a view of what it truly is to be a modern woman in search of her soul...and that, my friends, helps us all."
3,Worth the read,"Having read some of Lamott's other books, this was a continuation of her autobiographical take on life, religion and spirituality. Entertaining because I had read some of her other books, but nothing to profound in the spirituality department. I do love Lamott's brutal honesty of where she has been in her life and what it has taught her in a very humanistic way."
5,Traveling Mercies review,"Anne Lamott provides an inspirational and compelling story of her life and her faith journey. In the face of so many of life's darker sides and personal challenges, she finds a path of light through some of life's darkness. The most important thing is her thankfulness to God. Through all the adverse circumstances, Anne Lamott breaks through the darkness and into a world of hope and light to a great life of faithfulness and prayer which supports and carries her and her young son, even when the life throws them curve balls and ugliness. A very compelling read!"
5,Traveling Mercies,I became interested in this book when I read a quote from it in a magazine article. The book is even better than I thought it would be. Good writing!
5,Lamott's honesty was exhilerating and refreshing,Reading Lamott's book made me long for her friendship. I could identify with many of her musings...her ambivilent feelings toward her mother....her excitement about her faith. She made me laugh and sometimes I felt like crying. Having an adult son who is a recovered alcoholic helped me to understand her struggle. I'd love to be able to hear her speak someday.
2,This book was not for me,"I found this book to be lacking the insights I was seeking. Anne Lamott's life is simply not that inspiring. True, she is a recovering addict who is also a single mom. True, she is a writer. But I didn't find any insights into the nature of God or faith in this book that I felt would qualify Lamott to teach me anything about God I couldn't learn from my own life or my own prayer."
2,"What ever it is , I missed it","Simply, I do not understand why the interest in this book. Very confused and lonely person with no answers."
4,Great memoir writer,"All of Anne Lamott's memoirs make me laugh and warm my heart. This one is no exception. I read it two years ago and plan to revisit it soon. This book is full of humor and wonder about life and spirituality as Lamott takes us through her tragedies, better days and everydays. For her, every moment is worth writing about and she always has a way of keeping you interested with her observations of the cotidian."
3,Entirely Expendable,"First of all let me state I'm a fan of Lamott and will continue to take an interest in everything she produces. But while Annie Lamott makes a very personal case for her faith and honestly depicts her experiences, I was not moved by this book as I was by BIRD BY BIRD, which, unencumbered by the ""baggage"" of religion, is filled with compassion, understanding and tenderness toward the human condition. TRAVELING MERCIES is much more self-indulgent, trite and unconsidered - okay if there's nothing else around to read, but hardly ""essential reading""!"
4,A very human spiritual journey.,"The journey, with all of its failures and wrong-turns, becomes a beautiful thing to see. She does not end up where I would have ended up, but her experiences ring true."
4,"An unedited, simplistic journey of faith","Anne Lamott shares with us her haphazard stumble upon faith. A simplistic honest example of her struggle with her own self-reliance and eventually her release of her life to God. She points out that the beauty in life is also found in the most unexpected of places. ""There are two things in life that pierce the human heart: beauty and affliction."" You can't experience one without the other. A great exploration of the human soul."
3,Interesting insight into a complex author,Anne Lamott is a gifted author who has made many contributions to the world of literature in a variety of formats. This personal essay illuminates more about her personal journey and allows the reader to share in the good and the bad. It is a hopeful book and shows that a person is capable of evolving.The best chapter was titlted: Barn raising. It once again gives evidence that we are all responsible for one another. This segment should be read by cynics.
1,aching.,"I honestly had to push myself to read this whole book. Yes Ms. Lamott is very good at writing interesting and descriptive fun things. She is a great writer. My problem is that despite the wonderful work that the Lord has obviously done on her life, she did not mention that anything she had done or that those around her were into was sin. . it just seemed like she was condoning too much in order to draw people in. She can definitely be used to inspire those who are looking for faith, yes, but at the same time I had a hard time reading things due to my personal knowledge of the Bible and scriptures. I can certainly see that the Lord is still working hard on her, and that she has a relationship with God, and so that made me happy. It just wasn't the right book for me to read. I am too into apologetic and theological studies (and using one's experience to even talk about those things)."
3,Profanity spoils this book for me.,"If Anne Lamott could have written this book without profanity, I would have liked it a lot more. As it was, I had a hard time relating to a woman who used the ""f"" word around her seven-year-old son, Sam.She has so many wonderful stories in this book, especially of the people of her church, and many friends. Lamott's a gifted writer, a survivor, and other great things, I just wish she'd lose the profanity."
3,Not so great,"I read this book because it was chosen in my book club. Everyone felt it was just an O.K. book. Parts of it were really good, funny. Mostly, I felt that I just couldn't connect with her, couldn't relate to her. Being from Northern California, we all enjoyed the references to places that we know. Overall, it wasn't one that I'd recommend."
2,Very Women Focused,"There's no question that this is a well written book about one WOMANS spiritual journey. Heavy emphasis on woman. As a man,I had a hard time relating to many of Lamotts essays. Specifically the ones about fat thighs, not being pretty, bad hair days, not looking good in a bathing suit, eating disorders, boyfriend problems, etc. I just couldn't relate.The book gets kudos from me, however, for showing that it's possible to be a liberal and a Christian. I also liked the overture section that detailed her path to Jesus. Women will love this book (as the review show), men might have a hard time relating to Lamotts life story."
2,Far Under Par,"I was told by a classmate that this book was inspirational, funny, and a great read. Also, former raving reviews caused me to buy it. However, I was very disappointed and did not even finish the whole text because I couldn't stand one more cheesy metaphor about her haphazardous life."
4,It's a non-fiction essay(!),"For those who aren't interested in the non-fiction essay genre, don't read this book! If you are interested, you'll like this. 'Nuff said."
3,Disappointing,"I read two-thirds of the book and just felt like I couldn't go on. Boring (to me) were the anecdotes about her drinking, her dieting, worry over her son's wanting to ?parasail, her son's health, whether a mole she had was cancer,etc. This is a book for women and for people who have been drunks and are now sober. Some of the anecdotes were good, but I didn't feel any of it said much about religion - yes, there was a chapter on finding God, but it didn't impress me. The author is intelligent and can write well, but that's about all I can say. This book is not a memorable one for me. Now I'm in search of one of those books that just carries me seemingly effortlessly into another world and one from which I will feel I have gained some truly valuable insights."
4,Interesting spiritual journey,"This book trace the spiritual journey of Anne Lamott. What I found most interesting was the level of honesty that she put down on paper. She presented her information without commentary or too much generalization, that is what the reader is supposed to do."
3,Lots of Detail:,This was more autobiographical than I expected; Anne has had an awful lot of trauma / challenges in her life - whew! But I think that other people's life challenges are interesting and I can pull value from others' faith journeys. Some of the minutiae was tedious . . . but the overall journey was absorbing!
4,traveling mercies,"lamott is an excellent writer. she brings the reader into her world in a way that is comical, sad, and spiritual all at the same time! her description of the people who have affected her life is told in a way that made me feel felt as though i was actually peeping into their space!"
4,"Engaging, endearing, enlightening","All this author's work moves with a grace and wit that makes life's defining moments sharper and more poignant, but this one is the best yet. Finding faith today is hard, but Traveling Mercies gets you there in riveting style. Only book better than this right now is ""Everyday Naked"" by Bartnikowski."
2,Traveling Mercies doesn't cover any new ground.,"The ironic thing about the title of Anne Lamott's new book Traveling Mercies is that it really doesn't cover any new ground and basically covers many of the same experiences as her previous books. She doesn't stray much from events relating directly to her, nor does she write about how they may be affecting other people around her. Even Christianity seems to be just another excuse for Anne to talk about Anne. For a book on faith it doesn't seem to deal with the Gospel or Jesus in particular detail or depth. It is as if the challenges or conflicts of being Christian aren't worth being mentioned. Towards the end of the book, you can't help but feel annoyed at an author that seems so arrogantly self absorbed. There is a thin line between autobiographical and being narcissistic and Traveling Mercies crosses it."
2,I really wanted to like this.,I really wanted to like this book. I had heard good things about it and read lots of reviews of people liking it. To me though - it seemed like it was just a look of reflections on the author's life without much direction. There seemed to be very little about her faith and how that had helped.I apparently just missed the point.
1,Please....,You have got to be kidding me. You have got to be kidding me. You have got to be kidding me.You have got to be kidding me.
2,Explains a lot.,"This book confirmed what I always suspected: That the underlying causes of spirituality are mainly self-centeredness, instability, incompetence, and overwhelming bad luck. As I've said before with regard to Ms. Lamott's work, she knows how to write, but she sure as Hell (pardon the metaphor) doesn't know how to live."
1,Navel Lint,"Lamott describes discovering navel lint with a friend from high school in one of her tedious essays. If only she had stopped there! Book Clubs across the nation have been subjected to this instead of something actually worthwhile. There are better stories about addiction and recovery, parenting, dating, and spirituality out there. Let's read the good stuff instead!"
3,What faith???,"Although Ms Lamot writes well and expresses herself in ways that grab interest, I am disturbed at her usage of pronouns ""She"" and ""Her"" in reference to God. This to me is an affront to God our Father."
5,WOW!,"This book is so amazing. I am a junior in high school, and i am reading this with my religion class. We all love it so much. she is just so honest and open about her life, and proves that God loves her and anyone else, no matter what. She is my hero and I really want to meet her some day!"
2,"Little substance, lots of self-indulgence","No, I'm not an English lit professor, just a reader who enjoys a good book. I was curious about Ms. Lamott since there always seems to be controversy surrounding her and her work. Well, I'm not a member of the Christian Right, nor am I a Republican, and I am well read and I can say this book was a disappointment. If you order steak, pay for steak, and are given hamburger, you're ticked. I was ripped off and I want a refund. Ms. Lamott should take a rest."
3,Great little microwave for the price,"Purchased from Sam's Club about 3 years ago for around $80. With 5 kids this microwave got a lot of use! It held up pretty well until the buttons stopped working one by one. The door began rusting on the inside about a year ago. It was fine for popcorn, heating pads, quick reheat of leftovers, didn't use for gourmet cooking."
5,Boston Globe Review,The Boston Globe review of this book is posted at : http://www.dianamuir.com/default/BG062201.html
4,The Creatures you didn't know,"From coast to coast with most of the concentration in New York, Anne takes us on a journey into the lives and habits of a more knowledgeable and sophisticated animal world within our cites. Just like humans, the urban animal in a lot of cases, has adapted to the helter-skelter urban enviornment; and in some cases better than humans have.A wonderful read in language most of us can understand, this book flows from man's early mistakes to the animal's amazing solutions.The next time we look out of the bus or elevated train window on our way to work, and see that Sparrow or crow fighting the family pet for the dog food, we'll know what an alternate food source means.Highly recommended."
1,New York Nature Deja Vu,"As an avid reader of books focusing on the political, cultural and environmental life of New York City, I was excited at the prospect of purchasing ""Wild Nights.""However, upon taking a brief read of the book, I got the distinct impression that I'd read it before! And as a matter of fact, I had four years ago: ""Wild New York"" by Margaret Mittlebach and Michael Crewdson.And just judging by a cursory reading of Ms. Matthew's book, I would imagine she's read it as well. Now, to be sure, I am not accusing her of plagarism. However, I do feel that her book is a rather artless, plodding retread of ground covered in Ms. Mittlebach's and Mr. Crewdson's lively and engaging exploration of the city's geographic history.Not to say that Ms. Matthew's book isn't comprehensive, it just isn't necessary."
2,Where Are the Attributions,"I would like to echo other readers' sense that they've read it before, and from sources not given credit by Ms. Matthews. And as an activist in New York City intimately involved in the issues that Matthews explores, I question the soundness of her facts. For instance, her account of the cricket action at a NYC land auction was really off. Sort of fun, but I think there are other more useful and trustworthy sources for the same ideas."
1,Lost in the Bronx,"There is a major problem with Wild Nights. And i will lay it out:There is a chapter called ""deep time in the bronx"" in this book which I assumed would have dealt with the Bronx--however the bronx was never mentioned in it.Very confusing and very bad....Why title a chapter ""deep time in the bronx"" when this borough is not discussed in any way?Is it to convince readers who are interested in the bronx to buy matthews' book?What happened? Did editors snip out all mentions of the bronx in a chapter titled ""deep time in the bronx""? Or did the editors of this book fail to notice that the bronx wasn't mentioned in a chapter titled ""deep time in the bronx""?I would like to know how this occurred, because I really wanted to learn about the bronx's geology, which I assume what the author meant by ""deep time in the bronx"".Please explain to me what happened to the discussion of the bronx in a chapter titled ""deep time in the bronx.""I really want to know."
4,"Good, concise, to the point infosec title","It is ironic that the advent of the computer promised to dramatically reduce paper usage; today's 1,000-page-plus computer-security tomes have probably single-handedly deforested whole regions of the earth. A happy exception to this trend of titanic texts is Enterprise Security: The Manager's Defense Guide; which is relatively concise yet highly informative.It provides a good overview of core information security issues and concepts. It takes a big-picture approach to information systems security, not bogging down the reader in arcane minutiae.Overall, it has a more management- and process-oriented look at security and it a valuable title for anyone needing to know about information systems security without sacrificing a forest in the process."
2,This movie is NOT for children,"As an adult and child of immigrants, I can appreciate this movie in many ways. The movie features beautiful scenery and superb acting. I chose to rate this movie the way I did, however, because of a truly GRAPHIC and totally unnecessary scene depicting the slaughter and bleeding out of goats. This scene lends nothing to the film whatsoever and has the actors actively engaged in the slaughter of animals. This movie is without a doubt worth watching and owning but children should not be allowed to view the pointless violence directed at animals in this film."
4,Great rendition of a difficult opera,Giulini and the lead singers are all involved and in good voice. The sound quality is excellent and the sound balance between the band and the singers is very good. The other reviewers (especially about the Recordings of the Century reissue of this rendition) have said it all. One cannot possibly be dissatisfied with this set. Recommended.
1,Don't buy,"I used this a few times and it worked great. It jumped my Volvo quickly. However, after a month the lights that say how much power it has went out. Within 1 1/2 years it wouldn't hold a charge enough to jump a small car."
1,after 2 years will not take a charge. The phone number for help on the charger is no longer in service.I would not recommend buy,after 2 years it will not take a charge. The phone number on the label is no longer in service. Do not buy this product!
4,very pleased,The book was in great condition. I received it quickly. I could not have found it for a better price.
3,Disappointed,"With a title like ""guerilla marketing"" I was expecting a book filled with offbeat ideas for book marketing. Instead it was the usual ""build a platform, do a lot of speaking engagements, make a professional press kit"" type stuff. I've heard it all a million times, and it's available everywhere. Still I give the book 3 stars for being well written and well organized. For a book that has the usual as well as more unusual ideas, I'd recommend 1001 Ways to Market Your Books by John Kremer."
4,Armed and dangerous,"This was the first book I purchased to help me promote my book CAPITALIZING ON BEING WOMAN OWNED. It was a very good first exposure to possibilities and to what the Publisher might or might not do. This book provides enough ideas that every author should be able to find some that fit his/her book, personality and situation. It does take some effort to pull out the best information for you because the weapons are not divided by book type."
4,Coldly Pragmatic,"This is not for the artiste. This is about those who want to market and publicize, period. It's a bit cold, if honest in its take on things. But, I thought Levine's Guerila PR: Wired to be better. Funnier writing, too."
5,This book saved me money!,I am a self published author and I learned tons of tips on how to do publicity myself. The resource section in the back of the book is wonderful- and I love the guerrilla tactics in each chapter. I wish I had this book years ago! Every new author can learn a bunch and save money using this book.
4,Every Writer Must Read This,"I am a journalism student, desperately trying to get published. This book offers many ways to get published that I did not learn in college. Right up there with Guerrilla p.r. by Michael levine, another must-read."
3,A terrific manual with a bit of hype,"I got some interesting pointers from the book. On the other hand it would take me one hundred hours a day, one hundred days a week to implement in a year the one hundred weapons offered in the book. A great source of ideas, it is also a little bit unrealistic.Andrew J. RodriguezAward-winning author: ""Adios, Havana,"" a Memoir"
2,Not much there,I was horribly dissappointed this book. It's almost useless. The few nuggets of good advice are hidden in the midst of filler material. It's mostly cheerleading stories about successful authors.
4,"""interesting to read about past military leaders""","This is an oddly written book by todays standards, however, it is informative.For anyone interested in strategic planning or battle tactics; you'll enjoy this book. Each captain outlined encompassed one chapter. At the end of each chapter Dodge pointed out the qualities and weaknesses of the captain, (eg. Napoleon). He also compared that captain to all the others.I find leadership strengths in military situations equally interesting to those in business. You may as well."
2,not what I hoped for,"Some songs are good but not quite what the review said.A mild disappointment.Just get ""Broken English"" if you want from Marianne Faithful."
4,Lots of ground is covered in this anthology,"I was going to get a CD of just ""Broken English"" but decided to get the 2-CD Island anthology instead because of all the great stuff on it. Marianne Faithfull is such an evocative singer - I have to say don't listen to this if you're depressed. There's so much hard-living and lessons learned in her voice.Overall, this is a great set of music, although I wasn't too crazy about the electronica stuff - simpler is definitely better for her voice."
1,"Poor track selection, even worse production","This 2-CD set features very poor track selection, coupled with a completely pointless track ordering. The tracks are arranged in no chronological order and jump from album to album without any coherency at all. But what really makes this compilation unbearable to listen to is that someone had the sad idea to fiddle with the original mixes, so most of the tracks sound different to the originals - and worse, for that matter. Avoid this mistake of a release - even if you're new to Marianne Faithfull's material and are just willing to get a taste of her music - and buy the albums separately, specially the two masterpieces ""Broken English"" and ""Strange Weather"" together in the 1-CD MFSL edition, and also the more recent ""Vagabond Ways"" and ""Before The Poison""."
2,Not near as good as Animalization,"A real dissapointment after listening to Animalization, and Animals on Tour. The only ""good"" song on here is Outcast"
5,"It's Been a Long Wait, But Worth It.","I've been waiting a long time for this reissue. I'm 57 and bought the LP when it came out. I've wanted to upgrade this one to cd for a long time. It starts a little slow, but picks up steam. Great vocals by Eric and some great guitar by Hilton Valentine similar in style to his work on Animalization, particularly CC Rider, which had a nice solo. He does some nice stuff here particularly on the slow blues. He's always been under appreciated compared to the Yardbird guitarists, but here he puts out work as good as anything they were doing back then. This is a great group of songs and performances, unique in the Animal's canon. Get it while you can. I got it very promptly from Hip-O."
5,Big History,"Diamond's approach is ""big history"". That is, he takes the long view, time-wise, and incorporates many other fields, such as biology and geography. This book is fascinating reading and changed my outlook on life."
5,The most interesting book I have read in awhile,"I can't recall the last time my mind was this stimulated reading about human history. Jared Diamond's book, ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" is a very thought provoking book. I came across it by chance at the L.A. Natural Musuem and glad that I did, it widened my perspective and respect for people of different cultures."
4,"Extremely educational, if slightly incomplete.","This was one of the most educational books I have read in years. Diamond analyzes several key elements affecting the development of societies, from the axis of the continent to the availability of plants that can be domesticated, and makes it all very interesting. One of the best-researched books on the topic, Diamond still doesn't pretend to have all the answers.Unfortunately, Diamond excessively downplays the role of culture and religeon influencing a society's development in the pursuit of avoiding offending anyone. The explanation of why the Fertile Crescent and China lost technological leads over Europe, a topic that should have been a key component of this book, is treated rather briefly in the final chapter with somewhat cursory analysis. Nevertheless, this book is highly recommended, particularly for laymen on the subject like myself."
4,"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","This book is a must read for all social science academics and the like. J. Diamond presents a clear argument for why certain societies are more advantaged than others. Although he is believable, his argument is flawed which makes for a great paper topic."
2,"Just a little bit too ""just so""","Interesting except his explanations were just a little too pat. That and numerous special pleading made me wonder whether or not his theories are valid. I'm not an expert in the fields I'd need to be to judge his claims. I think I'll add ""The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some Are So Rich and Some So Poor"" to my reading list to get another point of view. Another problem I had with the book is the author repeats himself over and over as if the reader were too stupid to remember what he said in a previous chapter."
5,Utterly fascinating,"Well written, very enlightening concepts, and highly recommended. I later saw the PBS series, which was a treat after reading this."
2,Questions Answers,"This is one of those rare books that starting every chapter and paragraph asks a lot of questions, tries to answer them from a allready thought of and given perspective and then finally leaves you with more questions at the end because something is missing and you don't know what. Couldn't/wouldn't finish it! ...and that's too bad!"
3,Good Theory but Too Long,"The author has an excellent theory about why world history took the course it did, with the western world taking control and then subjecting the rest of the world to its ways. It is well thought out and the documentation is excellent. The writing style makes it an easy book to read. The major problem I have with the book is it should have been half as long. Page after page is devoted to sideline discussions and irrelevent facts that are not important to the main theory being presented. I enjoyed the book but the thesis could have been explained and documented in less than 100 pages. Still, the thesis is sound and should have an important impact on historical analysis."
5,"Exellent thesis, good summaries, and entertaining too","I loved it by page 50. Well work reading.This should be everyone's starter history book, and then you go off to fill in the details."
4,Take it at face value,"The reader from Boston who advises us not to 'read too much into' this book has it right. I think those who are convinced that genes and racial factors have resulted in modern disparities in wealth and 'advancement' of the civilizations of earth will find a demon lurking between the lines of the book. Those who can read with a more open mind will find the book an accessible, thought-provoking work that displays a broad (though not always deep) understanding of many factors which have played roles in humankind's development.It's interesting to read the reviews submitted by the former kind of reader, most of whom seem convinced that white northern peoples and societies are the product of superior genes. It's surprising that many of them, on the vanguard of the evolution of human intellect, make egregious spelling and grammatical errors in their reviews!"
1,"A ""Mein Kampf"" of the PC movement","I made myself read the book because I paid for it. Rife with generalizations, most of which can only be described as stating the obvious. The bias from which the book derives--that potential answers to questions of why the world is the way that it is today may only be drawn from an approved list of solutions--is palpable nearly from page one. True scientific reasoning does not discard alien/differing explanations out of hand, but Mr. Diamond has no problem limiting himself, and it shows. Truly a mass of myopic overgeneralization every bit as worthless as Mein Kampf and just as dangerous. Dont bother."
2,Bad writing,"I wanted to read this, I really did. The ideas were interesting, and sound, but the writing was so poor that I could not finish it."
2,"Long, dry, and disappointing","It is very frustrating to give this book 2 stars because it deserves more. The concept and scope of the book is fascinating, however, the execution leave much to be desired. In talking with several people about this book we all came to the same conclusion, the book is too long. Diamond repeatedly brings up interesting points and then repeatedly beats them into the ground. A neat idea that can be covered in 3 pages, instead takes 15. After the first 100 pages yout get what he is talking about, but there is still another 300 pages to go. Unfortunately I can't recommend this book to anyone, because it is too painful to read."
2,Flawed and dull reading,"There is little point expounding on the prior reviews. If you are adversed to history, this book will validate your aversion. If you enjoy history you will find flaws in the premises advanced."
1,speaking in the air,"There is not one valid argument nor any strong evidence that Diamond can bring about. I found this book very disappointing, although I am not that criticial. I don't understand why people like that popular book that much. Maybe because it is politically correct and reads very easily?"
1,Unconvincing,"I found the evidence used in this book is absolutely unconvincing. I recommmend instead a much better book (IMO), Landes's The Wealth and Poverty of the Nations."
2,Poor condition,"I bought a new hard cover edition for my husband as a Christmas gift and the first pages of the book were torn. I was extremely disappointed as this was a gift, and was supposed to be brand new."
2,not outstanding,"Diamond's contributions to the understanding of the forces of geology and food production are important, but he seems to completely miss the point regarding other patterns which shape the direction of history. ""Nonzero : The Logic of Human Destiny"" by Robert Wright is a much more enjoyable and enlightening read."
4,An excellent intellectual journey.,"An excellent theroy to ponder, yet I find it amusing how threatened some people apparently feel over it's implications. Is it really so awful to realize that, just perhaps, we aren't all that ""special"" after all?"
3,"Brilliant Ideas, Rather Repetitively Written","I love a good piece of historical prose, but I don't need as many repeated ideas as Mr. Diamond offers me. I know that this text is often used for students. This kind of ""folding over of information"" is necessary in that setting. I'm just an interested reader! If it can be said in ten intelligible words, please don't write ten lengthy, overly explanatory paragraphs. Love the audacity of this text!!!"
5,The right way to view history,"After reading GGS, everything about ancient history makes sense and most of the pieces fall into place. The main point is well made: races have no place in the unequal development of societies. I only wish to have found more about what happened in Africa before the migrations to EuroAsia took place and what prompted them. Is there anyway we shall ever know? Also, I wish the role of religions in ancient societies, in particular how some religions fulfilled a necessary role to put some kind of order and introduce ""moral values"". How were religions born? But then, this would certainly deserve another book in itself.I actually started with a borrowed printed copy, but found out my handling through the days was damaging the book and I might not be able to finish it before having to return it. So the kindle copy was perfect. Can't go without my kindle! :)"
4,Lotus Guide Review,"I found that Guns, Germs, & Steel filled in a lot of missing pieces but the best thing was it gives a fresh outlook on why we have so many equalities among races. Until we find hard evidence we will continue to believe some of the old racist notions of genetic determinacy.Rahasya Poe, Lotus Guide Magazine [...]"
1,"Regret, regret",Totally regret this purchase. Two chapters in i quit. This guy is so self ceter and full of....? bull.
3,Not convincing enough ...,"Not convincing enough!I thought (and still think after reading the book) this topic is more complicated than being able to reduce into some small variables. For all topics, asking for a simple mathematical formula containing 4-5 variables may not be the right thing."
1,Disappointing political propaganda,"I sensed from the begining that there was something wrong with this book. The author was making his objective quite clear and it was not to search for the truth. It was to fight racism, which is certainly a worthy goal. Unfortunately, his weapon in this fight is to present some fascinating facts and then in a most unscientific manner reach a conclusion that is merely a possiblity but that is not proven. The key technique of argument is repetition and the demonization of Eurepeans. In a most bigoted way the author lumps all Europeans as one group. No attempt is made to explain why there are significant differences between various European groups. Why Norway is so different than Albania despite the fact that both had domesticated animals and practiced farming."
1,Very boring...,I was very excited to read this book and then very disappointed. It captured my attention for about half the book. The author makes several points that he supports with some evidence and then retells them over and over and over. Some of it is interesting but most is not the third or fourth time around. I read a lot and I will not finish this book.
3,Good if you're interested in the topic - writing's not great,"I'll leave Diamond's arguments for other reviewers (though I will say that I think his ideas make sense in light of the evidence he presents.) As far as the book itself goes I'll say that I really tried to like it but struggled to do so. I usually love books like this that tackle these big questions but found ""Guns"" to be a bit boring and long-winded. The writing didn't flow well and his point was sometimes hazy. I won't argue with the Pulitzer Prize award - the book is certainly exhaustive in its breadth and depth but it just left me a bit cold. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the topic but for a good read I'd look elsewhere."
3,To broad of a topic,"I liked the book but it took to broad of an approach to looking at the role disease, location and food on society. I would suggest Plagues and People by William H. McNeil as a suppliment/replacement for his chapters on the role of disease on society and on horizontal vs vertical migration"
1,Good PC History,"Diamond goes out of his way to not involve culture at all. This blatant omission forces him to only talk about facts that support his thesis. Of course, geography, resources, and population density are going to play a role in how successful a people are. But so does how they are governed, what role religion and science play in their civilization, are they accepting of foreign technology, in other words their culture.This book is very politically correct. The fact is that some cultures/civilizations are superior to others. Some of that advantage comes from luck in the beginning, but a large part comes from the choices a civilization makes as it develops."
1,god-awful writing,"Aside from all the logical, scientific and historical convolutions, which have been exhaustively noted by other reviewers, little is said about Diamond's writing style. He has a terrible command of the English language; he is repetitive and academically dishonest and inauthentic. I cannot really determine the reason this book made all the fuss that it did. What's worse is that this book gives people a sense that they learned something or that Diamond proved something when all he has done is poorly synthesized others' works without citing them, or made things up in a heap of dreadful language. Do not waste your time."
3,"Good ideas, atrocious presentation.","What Jared Diamond really needs this Christmas (or Hannukah, as the case may be) is a ghost writer. Jesus Christ Almighty is he dull--with the exception of the chapter on the Spanish defeat of the Incan Atahualpa. Properly rewritten, there's enough material here for a cover article in the Atlantic magazine. His rhetorical outline is straight out of Composition 101: first he tells ya what he's gonna tell ya, then he tells ya, then he tells ya what he's told you. If you found the previous sentence tedious and unoriginal, imagine it writ large over 440 pages. He follows this rhetorical pattern not just in every chapter, but in every subunit of every chapter. It's as if he feels obligated to repeat the material so often that readers will be incapable of misunderstanding or forgetting it."
2,Couldn't buy his arguments,"Reading this book I wasn't able to buy into his arguments. Too many sweeping generalizations and too many factual errors in the text. For example, when talking about bananas he writes about early man selecting for smaller and smaller seeds until there weren't any more. Modern seedless bananas are that way because they are triploid and sterile. This is something that has happened fairly recently, probably within the last couple of hundred years. Sloppy terminology, factual errors and the sweeping generalizations ruined this book for me."
2,Not a good Kindle Edition,"I already know this book is interesting and I'm looking forward to read it, but I give it just 2 stars because this is a very poor kindle edition. I'm pro e-book reading all the way, that's I'm a bit disappointed to see an edition done with no care at all, without the maps and illustrations that you can find on the paper edition. These maps, figures, diagrams are vital to the full comprehension and enjoyment of the book; they must be in the kindle edition also! I hope they will release a new kindle edition soon and that we can download it again for free, because this one doesn't favour at all the pleasure of reading on a e-ink device."
4,A well argued review of the history of us all.,"Mr. Diamond provides a thorough and enjoyable account of the origins of human society and the factors that determined the locations and natures of these societies.Although at points theoretical (as any work of this scope is destined to always be) I found the evidence presented both entirely compelling and interesting. While there are those who would readily question the author's reliance on geographical factors as the sole influence on the development of human societies, I personally find the theory quite applaudable and impressive.This timely work should play a great part in putting to rest the racist views long held by many who speculated on the factors influencing the development of human societies.Very, very well done. The only reason I have not given the full five stars was I would have liked to see the section on linguistics elaborated on a little more (although it is more likely than not my bias alone, being interested in the topic)."
4,Is somthing missing,"It seems odd that the second largest economy in the world today was largely ignored. Except for the one example of Japan riding themselves of guns after the civil war period, the author never mentions Japan again. The entire book is built on this idea that civilizations are built on the amount of resources with which they were endowed. Part of the Japanese rise to power was fueled on the fact that they were poor in natural resources. Although this is recent history, I would have liked the author to address this issue that runs opposite his theme. This would make it clearer how his model of history would be a better indicator of future behavior than the current model."
5,Finally! History that you'll remember...,"In the first few chapters, I learned more about human history than in all my years at school. Very well written, it summarizes why civilization evolved the way it did. It systematically dispels existing racist/Euro-centric evolutionary theories by focusing on the history of food production and its affect on the human species. Truly a fantastic and FUN read, I'm sending copies to all my friends and relatives."
2,alternative hypotheses,"Other hypotheses for the movements of power and civilization include:1. The English language is better suited to wise political discourse, wise government, wise economic choices Where the English have gone, civilization has advanced. Why? Is there a survival value in our syntax? Possibly. Good politics and good business need good interpersonal and written communication2. Aquatic life has a subtle preference for swimming against the current, i.e. swimming ""upstream"". . The water strider insects on my pond swim against the pond currents, for no evident survival reason. There may be within human beings a subtle reptilian urge to swim up stream, against the prevailing air currents. The dominant wind in both the Northern and Southern hemisphere are from the West. Our eyes turn this way. This may at first seem facetious, but is not . I could write a book such as Diamond's ""proving"" this conjecture."
5,An excelent book on the history of human society.,"When Guns, Germs and Steel was released several years ago I dismissed it as a pop history book. But, recently a friend described the book to me and I was intrigued.In the 1970's Jarred Diamond was walking along a beach in Papua New Guinea when he met and talked with a local tribal politician called Yali. In their conversation, Yali asked Diamond why it was that Europeans had become so developed, when his people had not. This book is a very thorough answer to that question; describing how tribes and bands of hunter gatherers became farmers who formed complex societies; and why Europe won.I just wish I had read this book when it came out."
4,"Great ideas, poor format?","I found the content of this book absolutely fascinating and thought-provoking. However, it took me forever to finish it. Maybe it's Diamond's writing style, maybe it is the repetition, but this book was much harder to get through than it should be. Maybe Jared Diamond needs a better editor?"
3,"Should have been named: Evolution, Archeology and Agriculture","I'll keep it short. If you were to begin reading this book with the crazy notion that you would be enjoying a history on Guns, Germs and Steel, you're in for a surprise.Fortunately I was still somewhat interested in Evolution, Archaeology and Agriculure, because it had almost nothing to do with Guns, Germs and Steel. It spent 90% of the time fascinated with the events of the world 30,000 years ago, made mabe 1 or 2 mentions of a gun, spent a half of a chapter on germs, and I think the author somehow forgot about steel all together.The title was madly decieving, but the book was still a decent read overall with some interesting theories about evolution."
2,I thought,"I thought the cd purchase was the whole book, not a few chapters. The purchase however, not being what I wanted was good for the limited information."
3,Already Said,"I was just about to attempt to write something that hadn't been written, but I see that is out of the question. The author, Diamond, is obviously very knowledgeable in his field of study, but it seems that he has attempted to simply write something that hasn't quite been said before. The result is the opposite of what so many have said regarding European supremacy throughout history, mostly recent history.Without going any further, I will just allude to Mr. Christopher A. Smith's review. I don't think it could be said any better. I am a white American, and I'm not sure I would be able to critique the work as effectively as Mr. Smith, since he notes his race and the fact that he still has a problem with Diamond's approach. Mr. Diamond's approach is indeed biased. I'm not faulting the author; I'm sure it would be next to impossible to tackle this subject matter without leaning one way or the other. At any rate, well said, Mr. Smith."
1,"GUNS,GERMS AND GARBAGE",ACCORDING TO MR .DIAMOND EUROPEANS HAVE A BETTER ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE TERRAIN THERE IS DIFFERENT IF THAT IS TRUE . WHY IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA THE MOST POWERFUL COUNTRY ON EARTH AND THE UNITED STATES IS NOT A EUROPEAN COUNTRY. HIS THEROY JUST DOESN`T MAKE ANY SENSE.
1,Talk about boring,"Unless you are one of those suckers who whole heartedly believe in evolution as fact and not just one theory of how we developed into modern man; this book will disappoint. He uses terms like ""pseudo humans"" and ""the great leap forward"". Bunch of nonsense. 50 pages along and can't read any more of this bologna."
3,Not bad,"Okay, so I was asked by my teacher to write a review on Guns, Germs and Steel. It is a pretty decent book and not very hard to read. While I have yet to get all of the way through it, Diamond raises some very thought provoking questions. i would recommend this book for and anthropology student!:)"
1,Jared Diamond: Just Another Racist White Man,"The premise of ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" is flawed, as anyone truly familiar with world history will immediately recognize. Diamond's unquestioned axiom is that white Europeans developed more advanced civilization and technology than the ""inferior"" peoples of color. But this is a white supremacist assumption...Don't be fooled, Sons and Daughters of Ethiopia, Mother of Civilization: ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" is a work based on the theory of white supremacy..."
4,Amazon book reviews as social science,Why is it that most of the people that denigrate this book use poor grammer?
1,Fiction or junk science?,"The author attempts in leaps and bounds to make causal inferences such as, ""Because so-and-so plant developed on the Euphrates, the region thrived culturally and economically."" For each of these myriad statements, he skips about 76,000 mediating factors along the way, as well as 4 billion other possible explanations. The cause and effect statements as put forth in this fiction novel are dangerous, unscientific, and completely uninteresting to anyone remotely logical. This was the absolute worst over-hyped book I've read in 5 years. It clearly overlooks the scientific method for the sake of appeasing the liberal masses. Big brother is now a liberal since this is the only kind of garbage ""science"" you can get your hands on anymore."
1,Tagline: 0% science 100% PC,"This book is a 100% reverse racism, where indigenous people are smarter, more intelligent than white people are, although - I guess - white people were indigenous 1000 years ago for Greeks or Romans. The concept of the book is one sentence: The development of civilization is based 100 % on geographical location. (And because Eurasia has the best location thus its people are the most developed.) Believe it or not, we learn at the end of the book why Europe is more developed than China is within Eurasia itself in just 2 to 3 paragraphs. You will be amazed to read it is because of Europe's coastline.Do not buy or read this book it has nothing to do with science, it is a cheap mainstream reverse Mein Kampf..."
2,Let the Buyer Beware,"Mr. Diamond is clearly someone who is of Western European descent but finds nothing, or very little, to admire in his own heritage. To hear him tell it -- endlessly, I might add -- Western Civilization owes it ascent and dominance purely through nature's circumstance. He discounts religion and culture as drivers in the development of nations. A ridiculous notion, indeed!For example, the Black Plague nearly wiped out Western Europe, but the Europeans rose from this period to begin the Renaissance era: a period of unequalled creativity and increased liberties for the average citizen, leading to the end of serfdom. If Mr. Diamond were predicting the course of the 2-3 centuries following such a cataclysmic event, I have no doubt he would predict the area to fall into great decline.People determine their fate, and the fate of their nation, through their individual actions."
3,A plausible thesis,"Doesn't mean it's always so, but the thesis is plausible. It's written in an entertaining way and does provide facts. It gets a 3."
3,Interesting...but,"Jared Diamond presents an interesting argument in explaining the world's iniquities...but after a few days you forget it.Not a ""paradigm shifting"" book."
2,Diamond misses the obvious,"The obvious reason why Europeans and Asians developed such advanced societies while other did not is indeed because of geography. Unfortunately for Diamond, it's not because of guns, germs, and steel. It's because of cold winters. Cold winters mean limited food. Therefore, those members of the tribe who did not possess the intelligence and foresight to prepare for a period of no food---died. China, Japan, Korea, America, and Europe get cold. Australia, Africa, Central and South America do not. The less intelligent genes don't get thinned out, because there is an abundance of food year round. That's not racist or biased, just common sense."
3,Save your money and check it out from the library,"Jared Diamond certainly had a wonderful idea for a book, something I have wondered about: Why did the West come to dominate the world? The answers are in Mr. Diamond's book, which is well written and organized but sometimes tedious.Mr. Diamond tends to mention and make reference to his speciality -- New Guinea -- at every opportunity. He must think the average reader needs main points reitereated over and over again, which is nice in a textbook but annoying otherwise. Mr. Diamond's book just needs some pruning: unnecessary detail sometimes made the book tedious.Worth the cost of the book: Ultimlately, no. Worth checking out from the library: Definitely."
4,Interesting book,"I teach world history at the high school level. Sometimes students will ask me why Europeans were able to so ""easily"" conquer and take over so much of the earth. This book attempts to provide an explanation to this question. The book poses some interesting ideas/theories that really makes one think about the fates of human societies. It made me really think about how a few hundred Spanish conquistadors could conquer empires of millions like the Aztecs and Inca as opposed to those empires conquering Europe. It's not the easiest reading in the world, but sustains interest for the most part. I would recommend this book, but be prepared to sit and read it in a quiet place without any distractions."
4,Great book; will get you thinking,"Guns, Germs and Steel studies human history with a geographical and biological approach that is both refreshing and informative. It answers some very important questions and provides an introduction to the phenomena of plant and animal domestication that (after reading it) seems essential to understanding human history. I wish I'd read it in high school! On the down side, the book is at times repetitive and has too few maps."
4,VERY ACCESIBLE TO THE LAYPERSON.,"I disagree with some of the reviewers who say that this book is not accesible to anyone not already familiar in this area. I have not read one history book besides this one since leaving highschool and can say that it was certainly interesting and has intrigued me enough that I will add history as a subject to my reading list. I find Mr. Diamond's style of writing very smooth, this book almost reads like a novel. As I have said, I know nothing of history and so cannot say whether his theories are correct, but they are certainly convincing. This book has made me realize that reading a history book doesn't have to be ""homework"" (AKA - torture)."
4,A scholarly work,"A remarkable history of the last 13,000 years. Diamond's prose style is a bit cumbersome at times but he documents his thesis with good data from a variety of scientific fields. I found the book somwhat repetitive but it is a facinating topic, well researched and well presented. A real thought provoker."
2,Determinism with a politically correct twist,"The book is best at illustrating the difference between the Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Prize. The author is a physiology professor at a medical school--essentially an amateur popular science writer. Each chapter is an historical and scientific gloss by someone with only an interested amateur's depth of knowledge about history and science. The chapters are disconnected essays, weakly attempting to explain why world culture and human history were predetermined without being racist or otherwise politically incorrect."
2,Written by the pound,"The thesis is quite interesting, but Diamond uses ten words when he could use one, and of those ten words five of them are either ""I"", ""me"", ""mine"".I can't believe this book won a Pulitzer. I was under the impression that the *actual words* counted, not the actual *word count*."
1,Facts to fit conclusions,"Such an interesting opening question - ""Why do white people have all the cargo?"" and such a disappointing result. Diamond says early on that he intends to creat a non-racist explanation for European dominance, constructs a series of variables (see above reviews) required for success, isolates three or four places in the world where these variablies intersect, and then proceeds to find reasons why only the Europeans could have succeeded. My favorite naked cop-out: China could not develop an advance society because its coastline is smooth, see, and so dissenters had no place to hide from a centralized government that suppressed innovation.(Um, why?) Europe's coastline, by contrast, is crinkly. Bettcha didn't know that!"
3,cheap,i bought this just for school because i had to write a paper on it but i did not like or agree with this book at all. WE DID NOT COME FROM MONKEYS!!!!!
3,"Fascinating topic, repetitive presentation",Diamond's subject and his lucid if plodding prose kept me going despite this books nearly fatal flaw: it is numbingly repetitive. Maybe Diamond expected a few thousand undergraduates to be assigned this or that chapter in isolation and so felt compelled to provide ample context from the rest of the book at every point in each argument he makes. Nevertheless the material covered is so compelling that the book made it onto my Christmas giving list.
2,needs chapter on alternative theories,"Advance and retreat of civilization is an important topic which, if understood, will aid our own happiness and survival. There should be a chapter on alternative theories. I have at least one other theory, not mentioned in any of the reviews, which I can ""prove"" or substantiate to be true, and I am writing such a book."
2,Overrated and Disappointing. Misleading Title,"Purchased this book after reading all the good reviews. Was very disappointed. The idea of the book is interesting, yet almost never addresses the topics in the title (Guns, Germs and Steel). Could have been more accurately titled ""People of New Guinea, Crops, Domesticating Animals and More Crops""The whole book is rather bias and should be considered opinion more than fact. Book is also very repetitive with the author covering the same point several times within a chapter or even within the same page."
3,Inverted racism (1st part),"Jared Diamond has spent 33 yrs studying the fauna of New Guinea. That leaves little time to observe the rest ofthe world. He thinks that the appearance of high civilizations is explained by favourable environments, especially those propitious for the breeding of draught-animals. According to him, people of Black Africa have not been lucky : as draught animals, they have only inherited of the African buffalo. And the African buffalo is reportedly known for its bad temper. Mr Diamond does not ask himself if the phlegmatic humour of our bulls and cows (do not be too trustful) does not result from an appropriated selection, getting rid of agressive individuals."
3,questionable from the beginning,"I haven't yet finished the book, but have found reason to doubt the Mr. Diamond in the preface and prologue alone. In the preface, Diamond states that the readers are not about to read a ""racist treatise"" and that the book doesn't ""involve human racial differences at all."" Skip a few pages to the prologue and Diamond postulates ""Why did New Guineans wind up technologically primitive, despite what I believe to be their superior intelligence?"" Is New Guinean a race? Maybe, maybe not... but reverse the statement and then see how the critics chime in.May society one day separate thought from nicety."
1,Eurocentric bias. Uses old theories now proven wrong,"It is hard to understand why this book won the pulitzer (though another reviewer points it out: only journalists give the awards -- not scientists, historians and others in relevant fields who could have pointed out flaws).Readers would benefit from reading J.M.Blaut's criticisms of this book, in his Eight Eurocentric Historians. Also any other author that can discredit this eurocentric nonsense (though they likely won't get awards from the ""establishement"" I bet!)"
5,Fascinating,"Excellent, essential and very revealing ! Read ""The Third Chimpanzee"" before you start this one..."
5,Opens ones closed eyes to the past,"Brings out the true definition of"" Conquest"" for various reasons. The main reason being an inert need to eat. You will be amazed at the few controlling the masses for unbelievable reasons It is well understood by those that have never been shot at."
5,EXCELLENT!!,"This book has totally changed the way I look at human cultures throughout the world and throughout history; it should be used as a textbook in high school world history classes. The explanations for how and why peoples around the world came to be how they are is extraordinary. At the same time, it makes one wonder ""Why didn't I think of that?"" It is a thought-provoking book that is definately one of my favorites!"
1,Very bad Kindle book,"Do NOT get the Kindle version of this book. Get the ""dead tree"" version. There are numerous illustrations that do not come through properly on the ebook. Some of the tables that do come through are almost unreadable. I was shocked when I saw a paper version after reading the ebook. I really missed out."
2,Tedious and thin on ideas,"If you are interested in this book, I would strongly urge you to buy his previous book _The Third Chimpanzee_ instead. _Guns, Germs, and Steel_ is merely a book length explication of the ideas contained in one 30 page chapter of that book. Unfortunately, padding them out to 350 pages didn't add much in the way of depth or interest to the ideas. Instead, Diamond goes through and repeats the same basic points 6 or 7 times over the course of this longer work. His writing quickly grew tedious as no new ideas emerged after page 40 or so--merely more repetitive hammering home of the basic points.Not that the core idea--that local biological factors had a decisive influence on the rise of early civiliations--isn't compelling. It is a fascinating perspective. But it's ultimately not enough to carry the entire book, and Diamond really has little else to offer. With _The Third Chimpanzee_ you get the same ideas plus about 15 other ideas almost equally interesting."
4,Panorama of History....................,"Jared Diamond has written a comprehensive readable book describing some of the prominent reasons that societies have failed in the past and often succumbed to invaders. It seemed well written to me and although I thought the title a little pretensious, the subject matter is good."
4,intriguing ideas but not groundbreakingly new,The book consolidated some not-so-new ideas and presented in an entertaining and refreshing style. It is disappointing that it lacks proper attributions in many places. The book also gets a bit repetitive and boring after a while. The key ideas should be able to be delivered in half of the current length.
4,A twist on an old premise,"Most interesting twist on the old 'geography creates societies' agrument, Easter Island et al. Well written and certainly worth the read, particularly if this subject fascinates you as it does me. Do not however waste your time on the PBS series. Dumbed down to the point of insult, it is truly lame.Donski"
4,A different outlook on the World,I thought that this book really put a spin on the way that I viewed the world. I was willing to accept the ideal of evolution but it never made so much sense to me until I read this book. The ideas behind how societies developed really surprised me. I did not expect it to be based so much on food production and animal domestication. The thing that surprised me most about this book was that before the Europeans arrived there were no horses in America. Finding out how people progress because of East West alignment as opposed to North South alignment made perfect sense to me. I never knew how many people were killed off with the germs from other societies. I was surprised by how many people were in the Americas and were killed off in order for the most immune race to survive.I got a little dull near the end when he was talking about the New Guenea stuff but besides that it was an interesting read.
3,Warning,Kindle version has no pictures. extra words extra words extra words extra words extra words extra words extra words extra words extra words extra words
4,Thought Provoking,"Seems to be a book everyone one should read, though I just love history. But this is history told with a unique perspective, more concerned with the whys rather than just the whats. Will cause you to rethink some of the ideas you've come to take as facts."
4,Interesting read!,"This book is an easy read. The most interesting thing for me is that it contains a great summary of the human world to the 1500's. If you want to know about anything from the development of metallurgy, to language, to domestication of plants and animals, this book talks about it.One con of this book is that it sometimes can feel repetitive. There were many times that I thought ""Oh, great, thanks for telling me again that 'guns, germs, and steel' are the end results of such and such."" I would have much preferred that the title be something like ""The Fates of Human Societies"" and slowly work up to ""Germs"" in the first third, then ""Steel"" in the 2nd third, then ""Guns"" in the 3rd third."
5,Guns Germs sTeel review by Rindge Leaphart,"What a great book. My girlfriend introduced me to the book and I'm glad she did. I'm not sure I agree with all of his theories, but I must admit I find it hard to argue against him. The detail /research in the book is stunning. This is one of the books that I can clearly say I came away a lot smarter (or should I say knowledgeable) after reading it than when I started. The book contains so much knowledge that in all honesty it is hard to retain all of it. This book covers a lot of ground and while it is not an easy read it well worth the effort. If you are truly interested in how societies developed and why certain societies seem to be more powerful than others, then do yourself a favor and pick up the book.Rindge Leaphart"
4,Thought-provoking and compelling despite its verbosity,"Jared Diamond's book should be praised for tackling the question of ""Why is today's world the way it is?"" without shrinking from potential controversy. Mr. Diamond presents a compelling argument as to why our world has been shaped Occidental civilization. However his prose is too dense and can lose readers who aren't willing to wade through it to find the gems of his insight. Arguably, the greatest strength of this book is the author's courage to explain our world's recent historical dominance by the West in the face of a certain backlash. Kudos also for the evenhanded treatment of all societies."
2,Eh...,I needed this book for my Anthropology class. Can't stand the book or the class but I needed it. Just not my area of interest.
4,Interesting and detailed,"This is really quite an interesting book, but many of the premises it offers I had covered in two units of Anthoropology at University. However it is peppered with enough interesting ""incidents"" from world history to make it worthy of a read even if you had no real interest in the subject matter.It is reasonably technical, and may be considered ""heavy going"" by someome disinclined to tackle such a volume. However it is still popular science, and takes a look at what are fundamentally interesting questions such as ""Why did some people develop steel weapons and others kept rock?"", and the bits I find most interesting, ""Why did some societies have the really evil germs and others not?"".All in all it is easy enough to read to be of interest to almost anyone. And it is, after all, quite interesting in a world which may shrink from asking some of these questions because of perceived ""political correctness""!"
2,Tries to do too much,"Diamond creates a sweeping picture of the development of humanity. However, his book is Euro-centric, patronizing and bound by European concepts of time and space. He fails to consider native perspectives on Europeans, does not explore Native empires to an adequate degree, and entirely dismisses the importance of religion to both European and Native societies. The author does not discuss the role of human agency in determining the fate of society. Diamond also fails to explore the China questions: having had the same or more advanced resources and technology as the Europeans, why didn't China take over the world? He discusses germs in depth, but spends little or no time on guns and steel.Having read this book side by side with Mann's 1491, I definitely recommend the latter"
3,"Good textbook, not a bedtime story.","As mentioned in the title this is a good textbook but not quite a bedtime story.This book was required reading for my geography class, and for AP World History in HS. The main theme -- Yali's question -- is very thought provoking but the themes become redundant halfway through the book.3 Stars."
4,Ambitious,"An interesting and enlightening book. It drags a bit, at times, but overall it was well worth the read. Diamond interoduced many ideas about human history that would have never occurred to me."
3,Reviewers,"I just ordered this book, and therefore can't say whether or not I agree or disagree,(why I gave it a 3), with the reviews I've read, but what I can say is that I dislike the ratings I've seen. If you review a thesis, the rating you give should not depend on whether or not you agree with the arguments, but on the level of the content and the writing itself. You all seem to enjoy the book, and just disregard it because Diamond supports his own arguments and not yours."
3,Anthropology not made easy,"I'm not sure why but this book was difficult for me to read. Prior to this book I had no background in anthropology. It did change my mind on a few long held mis-notions I had. For me this book provided a good (yet difficult) introduction in breaching the big subject of history of the human race. That is a pretty broad subject, huh? But this book did provide me some background and stimulus in this subject. I found many of Mr. Diamonds theories interesting and sound, but then without much of a background on this subject it comes out as just my opinion. If anything this book is thought provoking."
5,A page turner doused in details,"I was surprised to find this book an instant page-turner. Who would have thought that a very thick book full of historical and biological details would be such a fast read. Much of this stems from the fact that this book is interesting on many levels. For an analysis of human history it is quite thorough, for a discussion of our natural history it is enlightening and for providing the intellectual framework for an analysis of inequality it is the first of its kind. Lovers of history, evolution, archaeology, biology, anthropology and botany will all find delight in this book. A must read!!!"
3,Not an easy read.,I think the research and scope of this one alone was worth that Pulitzer. I am surprised it was so popular as I found it a very slow mover and not terribly easy to finish. Utterly fascinating insights though.Glad I can pick up something lighter now :-)
2,Very verbose.,"The author does not have a gift for writing. He uses so many sentences to state a fact communicated in one. He's into his vocabulary. I lost the themes of the book in his redundant phrasing. I don't know what competition he had in the Non-Fiction category for the Pulitzer Prize, but my guess is the CATEGORY won the prize, not the author and his book. Read chapter 18, forget the rest."
2,How to mix the obvious with preset speculation,"Not bad, but not real impressive. There is some real good work in there, but his ""start"" at 11K BC is a little silly. I've seen actually professional historians do the same kind of work with footnotes and all by simply starting a mere 500 years ago, Kennedy's The Rise and Fall of Great Powers. Like many politically correct people, he indulges in reverse racism that seems to down ""whitey"", but actually ends up slapping down the ""coloreds"".He gets the second star because at least he doesn't get into that ""BCE"" garbage."
2,He blew it on Page 20!,"While I urged myself on to finish the book, Diamond lost much of his credibility in his prologue. After making impassioned statements against ""racist"" assertions of ethincally based differential intelligence, he goes and says New Guineans are more intelligent than wetern Europeans. I am a south-west Asian ethincally so my reaction to that was not a defensive one. He fell headlong into the trap of guilt-driven Western reverse-prejudice. I can't beleive non of his editors insisted he take that piece out."
1,Annoying drivel - not worth your time,"All the hype led me to believe that this would be an insightful and intelligent analysis of world history. It was interesting, but it so very barely skimmed the surface of the topic that it easily could have been condensed into a ten page essay. The ideas are obvious, the treatment of the subject is shallow, and his writing is addressed to a second-grade level of world understanding. You can get everything you need from the book by reading the description and looking up some of the referenced material. Jared Diamond should not be respected as a scholar."
2,Just too long,"Although the subject of GG&S is interesting, and does shed some light on why, when and how different civilizations originated/developed, the book is so repetitive, that I did not bother to read the last 50 pages. Mr Diamond would have done a much better job explaining his ideas in a 150 pages, rather than in 400+ pages."
2,Not Recommended,"Well written and well researched books can still be seriously flawed, of course, and I believe this is one example. Mr. Diamond tips his hand fairly early in the book by taking pains to explain that there is no scientific evidence of genetic variations in intelligence and that this idea came about through Eurocentrism. He then states that his aboriginal friends of New Guinea are obviously more intelligent than white Europeans and wonders how the two cultures developed so differently. This contradiction and Mr. Diamond's pretty obvious biases made it very difficult for me to take his answers to this very interesting question seriously."
3,Interesting but biased,"The book deals with universal history using a new approach, and I think that Diamond does a very good job of dealing with the topic, making the book fun to read and providing food for the mind. Certainly, the books presents some important limitations as commented in other reviews: the deterministic bias, the lack of consideration about free human will in the study of human history (I am sorry, but explaining the extinction of dinosaurs cannot the same as finding the causes of the conquest of America by Europeans), the quick dismissal of facts that contradict his theory (his explanation about the difference between the history of Europe and China is, at best, poor, at worst, pathetic).Overall, the book is worthy of being read. But I am afraid that 'Collapse', his following work, is probably a continuation of the same stuff. Do not count me in for reading 400 pages of the same story. One book was enough."
1,Sleeping Pills In Print,I feel the book is accurate. His knowledge is deep. How this book became a best seller is the real mystery. It must be the catchy title. I'll bet most just went unread and made an inch and a half of paper with a nice cover for coffee tables. I use it for insomnia. My record is 5 pages before I'm bored to sleep.
1,Terrible!,"A sloppily thought out piece of unworthy, almost insulting speculation. I can only assume that the author was warding off the demons of politically incorrect other ideas. Don't bother."
1,Too Much Academic Blather,"As a history lover for decades, I gave this book a try, and two other reading friends did too. We love great writing, but only 1 of 3 could complete even half this book. Similar to Listening to Prozac, this book is written by an academic to impress other academics, but it has no heart. Yes, many of his points are no doubt true (you can say that about almost all history books) but the author's cleverly contrived way of organizing the material seems agonizingly pedantic, and this is clearly not inspired writing. Too much intellectual blather here & no heart."
1,AMBIGUOUS AND UNRELIABLE,"IF GUNS AND GUNPOWDER WERE SO IMPORTANT FOR THE SUBJUGATION OF EUROPE, THEN HOW DID THE ROMANS DO IT WITHOUT THESE TOOLS 1000 YEARS EARLIER"
5,"Very insightful, a worth while read","I highly recommend reading this book. Diamond provides compelling evidence for the disparity between civilizations. Any fan of history or just anyone curious about the rise of our current state will find a great read in Guns, Germs, and Steel."
3,"What is a good ""Great Men"" read?","To the historian from Wausau, WI. What is a good ""Great Men"" book(s) to read on this subject? There seem to be too many biographies out there, and so many 'Good' men."
3,Fun book but author has axe to grind and misses big point,"The author is preoccupied by political correctness and cultural relativism and his politics intrude -- and ultimately undermine -- on what is otherwise an really interesting and insightful work.But if you read the book or even a few reviews, you already know that. So here's my contribution: what his book is really about is chaos/complexity theory although I don't think the author appreciates that. Complex systems are extraordinarily sensitive to initial conditions and the development of modern civiliation is a complex system. A few extra grain species in Iraq and presto, 5000 years later you end up with New York and London. The irony is that there's nothing deterministic about a complex system. It's totally unpredictable. The idea of determinism that prevades the book is an illusion of history viewed through hindsight."
2,too many words chasing too few thoughts,"The book's thesis is interesting and by and large persuasive -- humans migrating from the Fertile Crescent came to dominate the world because of dumb luck, not any innate racial superiority. Unfortunately, 90% (or more) of the content of this book would have fit in a Scientific American article. The incessant repetition and the clunky style made it a chore to read. If Diamond is merely synthesizing and popularizing scientific orthodoxy, he should have left it to a competent writer such as James Gleick or Richard Rhodes. If he is appealing over the heads of his peers to the public at large, he should be excommunicated."
3,Interesting but overdrawn,"Diamond went on a search to explain why whites (Europeans) conquered nonwhites. Diamond's interesting thesis posits that geography is all. Diamond is no historian and he seems to think that if his thesis fails then the 'explanation' must be some sort of inherent racial differences. Diamond argues that the differences in geography allow different plants and animals to flourish so that some areas are better for agriculture, the basis of civilization.Diamond avoids discussion of religion's role in exploration and expansion, likewise capitalism. He also does not explain the differences between the successes of certain European countries, say England compared to Spain.Humans are apparently mere carriers of the inevitable results of geographic benefits. Ignore the grand theorizing, but learn from the facts he presents."
1,"Guns, Germs, and Steel is a political treatise, not science.","Jared Diamond's book, Guns, Germs, and Steel, is based on a premise which is undoubtedly correct, that geography has affected history. Unfortunately for readers who expected a sholarly treatment of the subject, the book only serves to detail the author's prejudices. Perhaps the book was written with college freshmen in mind as the audience; it is doubtful anyone else would be impressed with the author's very selective use of facts, his unproven assertions, or his hysterical invective against Europeans, however politically correct that literary style is at present. The author cannot even mention European explorers without placing quotation marks around the word ""explorers"". In the absence of any evidence of objectivity, it is difficult to take seriously any of his assertions. Repetitious in the extreme, the book is by no means worth the time."
5,wonderful,"guns germs and steel is an enthralling book that reads like a novel. it is also a terrific argument against there being a superior race. what i am waiting to see now is what arguments, research and writing it will generate."
5,Most interesting book I've ever read.,"This is one of those books where after you're done, you wonder how it is possible that you went through elementary school, high school and college, and they never told you any of this stuff..."
5,human history for the layman,"This book was recommended by a friend who taught Honors history at the high-school level. I have been enjoying it enormously - it has helped me to put into perspective how human cultures arose and intertwined, affected by geography, climate and other factors. A challenging but comprehensible read."
2,No,"This book plays into the politically correct attitude that no one is the master of his fate, that losers are always merely victims. I highly highly recommend as a book to balance this one, Lawrence Harrison's book WHO PROSPERS?"
3,"Interesting in the beginning, boring at the end","This would be a better book, if it weren't long and repetitious. For example, Part 4, which is a fourth of the book, repeats everything that has already been said in the previous parts. And what is the point of having all those photographs of people?"
5,"Fascinating, original, important.","This book is well crafted, well told, fresh, and significant. Should be part of standard world history textbooks from now on."
3,Destiny does not depend on skin color,"Jared Diamond offers a fascinating and compelling theory that it was environmental factors, such as the availability of domesticatable crops, and not purported variations in genetic intelligence, that enabled certain races of people to gain military superiority over other races of people throughout human history."
1,This book.... horrible! ><*,"Jeez, can you say RAMBLING?!To me the whole book is just a bunch of convoluted and verbosely-written essays on the evolution of mankind and its ""I wanna rule the world"" attitude. So there were some ""thought-provoking things"", but I couldn't get past the prologue without wishing I was reading a world history text book instead.Too bad I have to finish GGS if I want to pass the class I'm taking. I see a lot of bias and meaningless dribble in this book. Unless your life depends on it, don't bother reading this thing."
1,A narrow view and understanding of the world,"My biggest question is the criteria for awarding pulitzer prizes. No wonder we are all suffering from a slanted view of the world that has caused much fragmentation, misery and war.Scholars need to be holistic in their views but when those in medicine such as Diamond THINK they possess one when they actually do not, they succeed in propagating THIER own perspective to the lay person.A balanced, and well researched book---- this is not."
2,"Don't know,","I didn't read the book yet, but I think it is good since it is recommended by my teacher."
2,Flawed Logic,"This is what happens when a biased biologist plays at historian. From the early pages Diamond is clear in his bias that his friends the New Guinea Highlanders are the most intelligent people on the planet. His reasoning that you take an average American and drop him into their hunter-gatherer society and he'd never survive. Though the exact same thing would happen if you took a NG highlander and dropped him in a Wal-Mart. His disregard for major western military victories are glossed over if mentioned at all. Some good stuff on the history of human crops, but useless beyond that. Read Carnage & Culture instead."
1,Misleading logic - don't be fooled!,"Jared Diamond writes in a flowery, redundant style that makes the book about three times as long as it should be. Besides that, and more importantly so, Diamond glosses over major holes in his theory that require an astute eye to catch. Though Diamond's presentation of geographic determinism contains interesting information, it ultimately caves under itself as Diamond consistently brushes away the idea that culture had anything to do with regional success, choosing instead to embrace the notion of continental diffusion axes, and at a point, the shape of coastlines (the latter of which indicates some of the outrageous claims in this book). ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" sounds reasonable at times but as a whole is remarkably far-fetched. This book is a prime example of how one should be taught to examine everything with a skeptical eye, otherwise the reader will convert to Diamond's skewed view without ever realizing the fallacies he presents."
3,A nice liberal point of view. Globalization with World Systems theory,"Good book if you are an intense liberal. Hang on.For the rest, it's good information that can be weeded out."
1,"So, Diamond, Aborigines are genetically superior to Europeans?","Considering Diamond stated at the outset of this poorly written book that he was not writing a 'racist treatise', I was confused when I read several pages later that Australian aborigines are genetically superior to Europeans. Really, Diamond, how does an alleged superior ability to map out one's environment translate to genetic superiority?"
1,Propaganda,"It took me only about ten pages to determine that the author has an agenda and is using the book to further it. Here is a guy who embraces everything ""other civilizations"" offer and utterly rejects the contributions of western civilization. Like his personal experience working on a ranch, where the only worthy individual was an American Indian. Everyone else was some kind of scum. I could only take enough examples of his distorted thinking, before I became ill with this garbage and put the book aside. My great regret is my loss of money in buying this completely distorted and unwise edition. This guy is responsible, in many ways, for the thinking of so many kids coming out of our schools today who say (with feigned sagacity) ""I won't be reading any books written by white European men."""
4,"long, but compelling","yes, it was wordy and long. but it was a real page-turner; once I started, it was so fascinating I couldn't put it down until I had read the last word. diamond weaves a compelling tale, because it belongs to all of us. give it a try!"
5,Hope this opens the floodgates for a new approach to history,"What's so provocative about the book is the reliance on biology and other hard sciences to explain history and culture. Shortly after reading this book, I picked up Consilience by Edward Wilson. The two books share a commitment to applying the methodology of the hard sciences to the social sciences, to ground explanation of social events in molecular processes. Wilson's book is equally gripping."
4,Cleared many mysteries.......,I always tried to guess what would have happened if instead of Columbus going to america it was some Aztec merchant coming to europe..... In this book you can understand why that did not happen...A very interesting theory about the evolution of human societies starting from the first H.Sapiens....You should read it!
4,Full of interesting tidbits but some repetition as well,"Another work of sweeping scope that seeks to understand what the factors either in human nature or environmental circumstance have led to Western European civilization's domination of the world. Diamond identifies numerous factors in the environment (access to cultivable Fertile Crescent crops, presence of animal species suitable for work, East-West continental alignment) and history of Europe that make the dominance of its civilization inevitable. Human genetic factors are also examined and proven inconsequential to the dominance of the White Caucasian. This book carefully lays out a counter-argument to any physical anthropological theories of racial superiority. At times the multitude of examples in this 450+ page tome seem redundant. Pulitzer Prize winner."
4,"Lots of content, Dry delivery","I learned so much about history reading this book, but it is a really dry read. I ended up taking a 2 month break half way through this book before finishing it."
5,An excellent system for understanding history,Diamond's systematic explanation for the broad course of history provides a construct in which the reader can place all the various pieces of information ever learned about past and present civilizations.
2,Progress of Civilization,"The problem with attributing human social development to externalities is that it glosses over the essential differences between all societies- that is how labor is socially organized and who decides how to allocate and use the social surplus. While geography tempers social development, it is the method of social production that is the overwhelming determinant of social success. Slave societies out produce hunter-gatherers. Feudal out-produces slave, and wage labor out produces slavery and feudal systems.What is more more instructive is how current social relations restrict and hamper social development by wasting social production on useless activities like military ventures and individualized social decision-making. e.g. Individuals riding in cars instead of individuals sharing mass transportation, a more socially efficient transportation system."
2,kindle edition is a ripoff,"Like the book but the kindle edition has no illustrations, maps and very crudely formatted tables. I was hoping that there is book website somewhere with missing images but no. What a ripoff."
3,"I prefer Diamond's new book, Collapse.","I prefer Diamond's sweeping new book, Collapse. It's much less ""academic"" yet it conveys many of the same ideas. In Collapse, Diamond sketches out the path of cataclysm. Environmental harm, climate alteration, fast population growth, and imprudent political choices were all factors in the ruin of some societies, but other societies found solutions and are surviving. Similar troubles face us today and have already brought calamity to Rwanda and Haiti, even as China and Australia are trying to muddle through in ground-breaking ways. Despite our own society's apparently limitless possessions and unequaled political power, portentous warning signs have begun to come into sight even in ecologically strong areas like Montana. This is an important book that raises many important questions. Every concerned person should read it."
2,"Wishful Thinking, finely wrought","A rich gravy of erudition smothers a thin slice of slightly tainted meat, i.e. the thesis (it's all geography & luck) is undoubtedly wrong, or, at the very best, accounts for tiny proportion of the discrepancies he attempts to explain. For detailed analysis, see the # 1 review by Christopher Smith (whom I don't know). There's more critical thought in that review than in the book itself.On the other hand, the ""gravy"" alone, the research and erudition, is probably worth the price of the book. Otherwise, see David Landes, ""The Wealth and Poverty of Nations."""
4,Great But Repetitive,"This book is fascinating content-wise, easy to read, but ultimately gets very repetitive. Nevertheless, I learned a lot and will read definitely read ""Collapse."""
4,Interesting read and full of crazy facts,After finishing this book you really do get a sense the author really knows what he is talking about. His premise is that humans are mostly a function of their environment and the environment makes them evolve. So many interesting facts about the evolution of farming and domestic animals.
5,One of the most insightful books I've ever read.,"This book gives you a very viable alternative to Eurocentric racist view of history. It's not always easy reading because he's very thorough, but the implications of his theories are mind boggling. Take the time to absorb it, you won't be disappointed."
4,Brilliant and provocative,"The read was brilliantly constructed by a multi-disciplined author. His thesis is provocative and stimulating. I kept feeling that had he been a trained theologian as well, the book's title might have been: ""Guns, Germs, Religion and Steel."" Never-the-less it was well worth reading."
3,"Made me think, but somewhat long","Reading this type of book was definitely a first for me. I've enjoyed reading various specific accounts of history, but to approach history in such an all-encompassing view definitely made me think and question some of my own thoughts and opinions. Because of that I would definitely recommend this to others. There are many times throughout the book that new ideas were presented and even if I didn't completely follow or believe the author's reasoning, the final conclusions oftentimes still made sense. I did find the book to be somewhat long though, and although the author's initial questions and his opinions/hypotheses on the answers to those questions got me hooked throughout the first few hundred pages, by the end of the book I thought he was starting to be repetitive and was just waiting for it to end. Still though just going through the process of thinking about the various questions the author proposed makes this book definitely worth your time."
4,A worthy book that dodges a tough question,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It provides a compelling, non-racist argument as to why the world's dominant culture arose on the Eurasian landmass. The book is worth reading simply for this reason. On the other hand, Mr. Diamond seems to dodge the more difficult question of why it was the European culture, rather than the Arabian or Asiatic, that came to the forefront - for all three had the same advantages according to Diamond's thesis. Still, this book is well written, interesting, informative, and a great conversation starter."
2,Read for a class,"Read this for a class. Felt it underplayed alot of the areas that helped in the development of societies. Diamond seems to think that only these factored in, which is not the truth."
2,okay,What can I say about this book that has not been written already? It seams the author has a view then went out to write a book that proves this view. Interesting ideas but there is not one chapter that would prove his theory wrong. I find that odd that everything points to him being right.
4,GG&S is a great book but the Kindle version has problems,"Jared Diamond is a masterful author. His book, Guns, Germs and Steel, is an awesome discussion and exploration of the rise of human technology, political organizations, writing, and languages in the different continents and areas of the world. Diamond's command of the issues and supporting facts and numerous insightful examples is stunning and presented in very understandable ways.The only criticism I have has to do with the Kindle version of the book. The figures that are referred to in the text are missing in this version. Maybe Kindle can't handle these figures. This is too bad because the figures sounded very interesting. Also, the formats of the tables in the book are hard to read on the Kindle."
4,"Great book tying history, linguistics, biology, etc. together",I thought that this was a fantastic book explaining the history of man on different continents. The format of the book kept me very interested going from the basis of food production to all the outlying factors in the success or lack of success in different human civilizations.
5,A book that stays with you,"I read this book over two years ago and still lean on it as a point of reference in my mind. This book is unique in a sense that this is history written from the point of view of an anthropologist. I didn't find this book to be biased in a political sense, although Mr. Diamond certainly has and is entitled to his own professional bias. I also didn't find this book anti-Western in any sense. Mr. Diamond doesn't deny that Westerners deserve credit for the advancements they made. He simply seeks to explain why these advances happened in one locale and not another, by one set of people but not by another.Although I read a lot of history books, here, for the first time, I read a comprehensive account of the origins of food production and basic agricultural technology, and how they impacted the development of civilization.This is a thick book but it is worth your time if you are intellectually curious."
1,"No original contributions, poorly written","Jared Diamond's ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" correctly suggests that environment is a major factor in the development of human societies. But his dismissal of all other factors involved and his inconsistent use of examples to suggest his arguements without any balanced discussion trouble this reader. The most valuable part of the book is ""further readings."" He cites the excellent work by the Cavalli-Sforzas on paleobotany and a number of works on the effects of disease on human society. Read the references; ignore this book."
5,Thought provoking and compelling,"What a fascinating book this was! This is the book for you if you have ever wondered how we ever got to the haves and have-nots with respect to civilizations and geographical locations throughout the world. I know there are some competing theories with respect to some of the specifics discussed and, I suspect, there always will be, but the material is presented with such logic and evidence that I believe the author is surely mostly correct, if not completely so. This is a book, that if widely read, would help to lessen some of the arrogance and bigotry in the world."
4,No need to go into the theories here,"If you want to know what he's talking about before you read the book, the other reviews capture it well. Basically, it's a history of humankind, more specifically, a history of those times and accomplishments of humankind that have created the world we know today; its inequities, differences, and similarities.It is extremely interesting, I've heard most of his arguments put forth piecemeal by people in the past, but this book looks to the evolution not only of people, but the larger societies of the world today, and of those that are unknown to the world at large, and his ideas of how these groups ended up dominant or peripheral.The four stars would be five had the end not been so repetitive; it was actually difficult to get through parts of the last chapters, but overall, for all the effort and linkages among anthropoligical specialties, it is an amazing book."
4,Don't be Intimidated!,"When I first began to read this book, I was so intimidated by the advanced wording and content I almost gave it up. I didn't, though, and ended up really enjoying it.Why are societies today the way they are--some very advanced, others not much different from where they were millennia ago? Why were these advanced civilizations able to conquer more disadvantaged ones? What causes some countries to be disadvantaged in the first place? This book will answer these questions and more.So keep reading!! It might be hard going in the first few chapters, as I said, but it's really worth the effort to read.Highly recommended."
5,Great pre-text for history,"I can't add much here that reviewers before me haven't touched upon. Truely unique interwoven account of history and science. I'm not really a ""science guy"" but more of a history buff and I found this to be a great pre-text for history. If you like American or European history, this book is a great way to fill in some of the mystery between the start of civilization and the modern establishment of nation states. Some people have found fault with pedantic aspects of the book but I found these easy to brush aside. It drags a bit toward the end but it's a surprisingly quick read."
4,Fascinating!,"The 28 page annotated bibliography, alone, would make Professor Diamond's book worthy of the purchase price.As an additional, priceless benefit he convincingly demonstrates for us the determining impacts of geography, environment, agriculture, epidemiology, and ""just-plain-dumb-luck"" upon history. By doing so, he cuts through racist explanations of history, as cleanly as Alexander cut through the Gordian knot.In Dr. Diamond's world, there is no such thing as manifest destiny. There are only people who are more, or less, blessed and joined together by their common humanity. That's an anthropology to which we can all subscribe!"
4,Good with Caveats,"The fact that a book that claims to explain the origins of human society doesn't contain a *single* controversial statement from the perspective of the politically correct left should perhaps come as a warning sign that this book is less of a revolutionary exploration than a reflection of current academic biases.That being said, this is an incredibly good book."
3,A well planned rehash.,I would be surprised if any other readers have read the 1988 book by University of Texas Professor: Richard Newbold Adams; The Eighth Day : Social Evolution as the Self-Organization of Energy.Diamond does a fine job of ripping off and popularizing a wonderful idea. The principal idea is that grain based societies as oppossed to vege-culture societies had a great advantage in warfare. (How many potatoes can you carry in your sack?)A fun read but let's have some kudos.
2,"Interesting ideas, but not worth 400+ pages","The author presents a simple and credible set of ideas. Unfortunately, far too much text is devoted to countless long-winded examples that don't add much insight or credibility to those ideas. Instead of reinforcing the author's arguments, this serves to obscure them in the endless verbiage, and bores the reader into a coma."
5,Where was Jared Diamond when I was at high school?,"Learning history and geography without learning the key concepts described in Guns, Germs and Steel book is like learning biology without the theory of evolution.Are these concepts being incorporated into high school curricula? I hope so."
2,"disappointed in this ""so-called"" scholarly work","I wanted to place GUNS, GERMS, AND STEEL beside THE RISE AND FALL OF THE GREAT POWERS, with its economic viewpoint, and beside THE INFLUENCE OF SEA POWER UPON HISTORY, with its naval viewpoint. Unfortunately, this book, while arguing for the primacy of geography in determining human history, introduces additional biases that render it unreadable."
2,"A few interesting anecdotes, but the rest is tedious.","I believed the cover blurb about this book, and was sorely disappointed. The only time this book came alive for me was when the author related personal anecdotes from his research and travels. The rest was rather tedious and boring."
3,Three great books in one volume...,... unfortunately all three of the books are on the same topic and say the same things and are mixed together randomly. There is so much repetition and redundancy in this book that a good editor could have cut more than half of the words and still all of Diamond's points would have been made (albeit only once per point). If you value your time it might be better to watch the TV show.
3,A dry look at an interesting history,"I really looked forward to reading this book recently, but I've been disappointed by how dry it is. Suffice to say, I've put it down for other books this summer. Maybe I'll dive into it this winter when I'm not feeling guilty sitting here reading."
4,Reductionism,Very astute and interesting But : 1 All the mystery of the origin of civilization is reduced to down-to-earth factors such as the possibility to raise cattle in favoured areas 2 Mr Diamond has been very impressed because he has met an intelligent Papuan - That seems to be the key of his vision of History
3,Provocative but Flawed,"Provocative concerning geography's impact on culture but flawed and inconsistent in its attempt to prove that races are of equal intelligence is how I would discribe Guns, Germs, and Steel. Jared Diamond definitely needs to study more evolutionary biology. I recommend THE BEAK OF THE FINCH as a good place to start in order to understand how quickly evolution can and does occur. Whether survival advantages conferred on the most future oriented or small tribal populations which benefited from a kind of genetic drift roulette wheel the evidence shows that races are not of equal intelligence. Even homogeneous populations within racial groups show remarkable differences in intelligence. On the other hand the impact on culture caused by the ebb and flow of people across Eurasia is quite convincing."
3,Guns Germs and Steel,Way too much trivial repetative detail. Too much opinion. Not very interesting conclusions.I was hoping to get a more interesting narrative but all was common sense.
3,Interesting topic but tedious reading.,"This book tackles an interesting and complicated topic. The author's commitment and scholarship are impressive but it is not at all well written. At times, its style is only somewhat better than the dullest of textbooks. Adding to the tedium, are numerous repetitions of material. This may be due, in part, to the difficulties of organizing such a mammoth topic but I mostly blame poor editing. I expected to enjoy reading this acclaimed book but found it dull and surprisingly lacking in fresh, illuminating ideas."
5,Fascinating exploration of why things happened,"I never enjoyed history in early grades where it was primarily memorizing names, dates and places. In later grades and in college I grew to love history as the focus became why things happened, what influenced the decision makers. Originally I thought of influences in terms of ideas and cultures. What I loved about Guns, Germs, and Steel is that it opened my eyes to the influence geography, zoology, biology and other scientific fields have had. Previously these influences were lingering in the background but this book has greatly raised their importance, its a fascinating new lens to view history through."
3,Factual reading but not my type of book,"have read ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" because my sister indicated it to me as a good reading. It really is a good reading, specially given the astounding set of facts that the author lists for the benefit of his theory, which basically tries to address the following question: why did the europeans conquer the world and not the other way around? Not being an apologetic text, quite to the contrary, the author wants to demonstrate that what is behind the dominion of West over East is assigned to factors well beyond the control of any given human race, but mainly attributable to the play of factors not the least imputed to any race supremacy. Notwhidstanding all this, he ascertains that the earlier the domestication of animals and some varieties of staples and cereals, the more prone are human beings to be innoculated against the vagraries of some virus or disease."
4,old ideas published for the first time,"While accurate, the theories presented in this book is nothing new. Perhaps the first time published, though.Nevertheless, it is still factual and a recommended read.If you want something that will really knock your socks off go online and search for William James Sidis' ""The Tribes and States"" (unpublished). You'll get a lot of the same as in GG&S, along with political and historical content."
3,"Guns, germs, steel, and a lot of words","While I will not suppose myself as a top literary critic, especially for a Pulitzer prize winner like this, I do have some thoughts to share. On the positive side, it had an interesting content and approached a difficult topic in a different light that I personally had not seen before. The examples were clear for the points made.Now for the other side of the coin. The 480 pages make for a very long read. Add to this length a tendency by the author make the same point over and over and over and (you get my point) in the delivery of views. It made the book feel like 1480 pages. In my mind, this really took away from the arguments presented as it seemed to be very deliberate and not just some kind of writing style.Read it anyway - I see there is now an abridged version - so get that one instead of the original.Note that 2.5 stars rounds up to 3"
4,Worth the time to read,"Overall a fine book; well worth reading. I learned more about the history of man from 500,000BC to 4000 BC in this book than in the rest of my life put together. The overwhelming global perspective this book makes it even more valuable. Truly a fine description of many of the core formative elements of society.The books bends over backward to avoid any taint of racism. However, Mr. Diamond oversteps his bounds when he claims that he has resolved all issues that deal with how racism arises. I wish that these issues were as easily resolved. The older deeper issues that arise before the foundation of human society still exist. And Mr. Diamond's smug self importance taints an otherwise fine book."
3,Agronomy is history,"I'm an (unenployed) agronomist, here in Brazil.I read this book here in Brazil.The best in this book is to show, how agronomical factors decided, how history will be writen later.The natural decision to put all wheat in Middle East, more the presence there of bull, pig, goat and lamb; give to the middle easterners the cradle of civilization and writing.The deseases with domestic animals exterminated indians, centuries before smokeless guns be invented.In other words, agronomy is history.The problem of this book is to forget the fact, that not only agronomy is history.Religion and politics are so importants, as nature to the history.To example, before Islam countries such as Iran, Iraq, Egipt, Algeria,etc. were among the most richest, literate and progressive parts of the world.Why any of 40 most developed countries of the world, is islamic?Because religion shapes the world.The same happens in politic decisions."
5,Great Book,"I read this book about ten years ago, and later gave away my copy. I bought another because I wanted to read it and give it away again."
4,Makes you slap your forehead and wonder why you'd never thought of this,"Eg. a crop moving quickly along the same latitude, but taking a long time to traverse north/south because it would be crossing such radically different climates; or how impoverished a people can be if they are in an area with no beasts of burden to domesticate.I appreciate Diamond's expression of his opinions, neither too lengthy, nor too brief. Pat his editor on the back."
3,Informative and lengthy!,"Now this is a good book. It might appeal to some yet some might hate it. It's all a matter of opinion. I had to read this book for my AP World History class. I skimmed through most of it, just trying to find the answers to my questionnaire I had to complete. The book is very lengthy and can get boring. Some chapters, like the one about Pizarro and Atahualpa, were very interesting! If you want to learn about why human development proceeded at such different rates on different continents then read the book! That topic may very well peak your interest. The theories provided in the book make sense and I have to say I agree with most of them."
4,"Author admits bias, but good perspective on how societies start","Just finished this book today... Of course this book is biased, he admits this in the ""Afterword"" section, in the first few paragraphs. Of course he has a few opinions about different groups of people being ""smarter"" than others (Eurasians) but he admits that it is his opinion. It's a great persective and I think it supplements nicely with other history books, filling up a few ""holes"" in history....which is riddled with biased holes like swiss cheese! It's interesting and I won't take his extensive work for granted. Also, his afterword gives a lot of insight of how free trade, free economies and de-centralized governments provide a better standard of living for everyone. Examples include the differences between South/North Korea, former East/West Germany, the D. Republic and Haiti...etc. Great points!If anything, Diamond is biased in multiple accounts but the book is nothing short of amazing..."
5,A must read!,"I have heard enough about Diamond's theories throughout this book that I decided to break down and read it. I have to admit that I am very happy I did. Diamond did an excellent job in summarizing (in just over 400 pages) the path of civilization leading up to life as we know it today. His arguments are not only interesting but also concrete. Although I would have liked to have more of the book focused on the future outcomes of the world, I do believe that this book accomplished what Diamond had wanted it to achieve. It's a great read, which I look forward to passing along to family members and friends!"
5,How the world is structured,"If you liked The World is Flat and anything by Malcolm Gladwell, this is the perfect book for you, written before any of these others."
5,"Solid writing, solid logic.","This is a great read, so long as you don't get bored by detail (I don't!). The author is very capable of taking a seemingly boring topic, and creating an entire book around it.To any person who thinks human variables trump geography and other environmental variables, it important to remember that without the geography to creates the environment that people operate in. I know it sounds stupidly simple, but think about it. One person could not dominate Europe for a great period of time, because of Europe's geography. One person could, however, control all of China, because of China's geography. Thus, without the geography to create the environment, there is no way for any one person to affect the future of the continent."
3,"New Perspective, But One Dimensional.","This book is excellent for linguistics, genetics and environmental knowledge. Yet, it is one dimensional because it overlooks that human choices matter. In some areas the scientific evidence was sparse and could have used more analysis. Human ingenuity is virtually ignored, as are the various discoveries that changed societies. His thesis that geography determines history was certainly interesting, but inconclusive. It also was written in a dry textbok fashion. I suggest readers balance this work with those of David Landes, David Keys, and Michael Hart."
4,Converted Lover of History,"I'm reading this book and while its not a ""can't put down and go to sleep,"" it is one of the most informative and interesting books I've read. Diamond explores every aspect of human development. He very clearly and patiently explains how we got to be ""the first world"" and others didn't and throws in a lot interesting facts and snippets of history. How was the Cyrillic language created? Where did SARS (others preceding it) come from? Why does Europe eat so much bread and South America eat so much rice?Definitely a must read."
1,"Unrated, unreceived!!!!","Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fall of Human Societies, by Jared Diamond:I Ordered this book on 4/24/09 and estimated delivery was May1 to May 18. So, on MemorialDay I still have not received this book. So, you see I can't really give you a review because I have been stiffed out of $15.98 by ""bbofbing"".D. Aubin"
2,Repetative,"VERY easy reading. As one reviewer already mentionned, it seemed from the get go that the Mr. Diamond had ulterior motives for writing this book. Motives that had more to do with combatting racism than seriously contemplating the historical nature of the effect of Guns, Germs and Steel on the worlds civilisations. Unscientific is the adjective that came to mind most often whilst reading this book. Several interesting points were raised but they were not properly referenced. This made it seem as if the entire book was a thought experiment on his part. If you have a spare night to kill, go for it."
3,biased,"Those of us not expert in history or the sciences are at the mercy of the writer of books of this sort. Much of it sounds very convincing, but when I read on page 19 that assumptions of racial superiority (when held by westerners) are loathsome and then the author goes on at some length to explain why he feels New Guineans are more intelligent than westerners, even providing a genetic explaination, I have to wonder if some politically-correct assumptions aren't at work. He winds up this section on page 22 with ""Why did New Guineans wind up technologically primitive, despite what I believe to be their superior intelligence?""Though there is undoubtably much truth in this book, the less-than-objective admission and puzzling double standard at the beginning don't lead me to fully trust the author."
3,"Good book, crappy Kindle edition","This book was all it's cracked up to be... however as others have pointed it out it's very annoying not to have the tables and charts included in the Kindle version. Some of the early ones were included, but the later (and more crucial) ones were not. Super annoying!"
3,"Without the Pictures, Charts & Plates","The book is excellent, but I wish the Kindle version included the PICTURES, GRAPHS, PLATES, etc. I finally borrowed a book so I could see what the author had been referring to, expecially the Plates. Much become clear, particularly when he referred to the the pictures of the various indigenous people of Africa. This isn't the first time the Kindle version has left out such things, and it's very irritating."
3,"Interesting, but is it true?","I enjoyed reading this work and reviewed the contained conclusions with keen interest. Even though the author presents many compelling arguments for the diversity and range of social and technologicl evolution of the world's peoples, I believe he provides no proof that these geo-biological circumstances account for all of the disparities betweem cultural and scientific advancements. What mention of the base genetic proclivities of diverse human populations and their resultant adaptability to environmental choices and options???"
3,Good Book! New Ideas! Fails to explain Western success,"The question is why the West has so much baggage.Diamond then shows that some societies are more lucky than others. There are only so many types of plants and animals that humans can use. Thus some socieites in Africa, the Americas before the Europeans came had a disadvantage. Then throw in the Germs and you have a very convincing, well presented theory.But cultures rise and decline. What caused Europe to borrow from others and then achieve a new level of technology? Other cultures covered in the book had the same geographical/resource advantages as the Europeans. So why did the Ottoman Empire with all its advantages, not dominate all of Europe?Guess there are some things we can never know for sure. They just happened."
5,Very interesting and well researched work,"I found this book to be highly interesting, historically accurate, and filled with critical analysis. The author backs up his claims with strong arguments which are well researched. He lays out the content of the book in a logical form starting with the clash of two civilizations: The Inca Empire and The Spanish conquistadores in Cajamarca, Peru. This historical episode, though placed at the beginning of the book, is shown to be the logical culmination of 11,000 years of evolution of human societies. The different rates of societal evolution form the basis of this work and are examined to reveal a few causal relationships which the author proposes account for the inevitable outcome symbolized by the massacre in Cajamarca. Suffice it to say that I found this book so interesting that I've gone on to another work by the same author: 'Collapse'."
1,huh?,It is difficult to believe that the Pulitzer committee would give its prize to such an haphazard collection of wild speculations and outlandish conclusions. Diamond's own political agenda is his business. But passing this book off as some sort of 'scientific' support of those misguided ideals goes beyond the pale. I only hope that anyone else reading this tripe will see through it as easily.
1,"Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies","I purchased this book before vacation based on a recoomendation of a friend. We obviously have very different tastes in books. I found the book extremely dry and tedious, with no interest to me at all.Counting on the fact that different people have different tastes, I left the book on a chair at the Philadelphia airport for someone to find and hopefully appreciate. I was not about to lug it around Europe for 2 weeks."
1,All problems no solutions,"I don't know, maybe it's just me, but if you're going to point out a lot of problems, at least have the ben wahs to offer a solution or two. How hard is that? I'm not a writer, but for this book, I could at least come up with something like: Teflon vest, HandiWipes & a good suit of plated field armor. Take that Jared, now go get another 6 inch lowfat Subway sandwich & be hungry again at 3:30..."
1,"A Cornell student who had to read Guns, Germs, and Steel","I'm a Cornell University freshman and i had to read this book. Guns, Germs, and Steel really ruined my summer. It's very long, repetitive, and not incredibly interesting. I also had to listen to a panel discussion about it and participate in a small group discussion. Every other student I've talked to agrees with my opinion, but hey, you might enjoy it if you like learning about the fates of human societies."
2,Liberal Revisionist Lunacy,"This book is an entertaining read: buy it for laughs. If you want a realistic treatment of the subject however, buy Victor Davis Hanson's _Carnage and Culture_.Quoth Jared Diamond:""That is, in mental ability New Guineans are probably genetically superior to Westeners..."" Really??? And this book won the Pulitzer Prize???Quoth Jared Diamond:""In fact, as I shall explain in a moment, modern Stone Age peoples are on the average probably more intelligent, not less intelligent, than industrialized peoples."" Perhaps this statement can qualify him for the Oprah Winfrey Book Club?So, the reason why Africa is such a hopeless morass, and why the Aborigines are still in the Stone Age, and why Arab countries are all suicide-bomb-promoting dictatorships, is because they are much more intelligent than Westerners? Didn't I tell you this book was entertaining?"
2,Inconclusive,"While this is an interesting book - it has no end. It is as though the writer was afraid to offend anyone and, while interesting points are made about civilizations and accessibility, it failed to state with any opinion how this reflects on modern society(ies). As race and cultural clashes our a part of everyday life, it would have been far more interesting to bring this research forward to a useful conclusion."
3,History by Accident,"The author tries to explain why some humans failed to develop technology and why those that did develop agriculture overcame those who did not. The author claims that there is no difference between humans and only accidents of geography have led to the current state of affairs. This all politically correct but does not convince me that all humans are interchangable. There is a gradient in all plants and animals. Some a prettier, some are faster and some are smarter. If this were not so, we would have no need for Olympic competitions. The book is written in scholarly way but the premise is flawed."
1,Great book suffers from bad Kindle version,"This is a wonderfully logical argument for how things came to be the way they are, but the Kindle version is a huge disappointment. First, text-to-speech is DISABLED. Second, significant figures, particular maps, are entirely missing. Finally, several tables are impossible to read. For example, Table 18-1 would be a very interesting comparison of many of the issues discussed in the book and would serve as a convenient way to tie several themes together, but it's presented in two chunks that don't fit together.Bottom line: check it out from your local library. Don't by the Kindle edition."
5,Must be a required reading in every high school curriculum.,"This book covers a broad view of human history and evolution of the human societies. As such, it opens one's mind in thinking broadly about all humans as a whole rather than having a narrow minded view and a clan based mentality. It makes you more compassionate and more understanding of other civilizations, and it makes a solid foundation for a lifetime of learning in this subject. In summary, it makes the reader a more well rounded and a better person as a whole. That is why I think it should be a required reading in every high school curriculum."
4,Germs more than guns or stell!,"Fantastic account of the migration of peoples, the historical significance of that migration and the influence of latitudes and longitudes to success of same. Important to note that many may view this book as somewhat controversial, however, it is in the details and data amassed to create such a compelling and interesting account of the history of societies. Very well done and excellent account of the factors that led to the development of power societies and the isolation that sustained and supported societies we now view as third world.Amazing the influence of germs and the influence of east west mobility within same climate culture to the success of peoples and societies. Highly recommend for anyone looking to broaden their intellectual intelligence of world history."
3,"Interesting, but overly deterministic and redundant.","Easy way to read ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"": Flip to chapter 18, 'Hemispheres Colliding'. Read 20 pages instead of 500, and you have the gist of the book. Not only this, but Diamond repeats his thesis ad nauseam--that the only reason Western culture is the dominant one in the world today is an accident of geography. While his theories *do* have some merit, in my opinion, he discounts completely (no, I forget...he mentions it in the EPILOGUE)the human contribution to history. I realize that 'Great Man' historians are on the wane in the face of the spread of humanistic psychology and the PC craze--but are we then to conclude that we are all nothing more than a product of geography, without the chance to change history ourselves? As an historian, I say no. But then, I'm rather biased. As is Diamond, an evolutionary biologist--this bias shows. Take it for what it's worth, and remember my tip..."
5,What romance is all about,I won't detail the plot here because others have done that. Just let me say: buy this book! Sweet Release will remind you why you started reading romance in the first place.Great job Pamela!
1,You have got to be kidding,I purchased this book on the advice of all the reviews on Amazon--was I dissapointed! This was so full of PURPLE PROSE I didn't want to finish. It was predictable and so sappy it was hard to take. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
4,"Pamela Clare is now on my ""must read"" list!","Trust me: Rush out and buy any book with Pamela Clare's name on it! I picked up Sweet Release and three other Pamela Clare books at a local used book store simply because I have quite possibly read every other historical romance out there, and these were new to me. I was floored. Truly, I read almost constantly, and have become somewhat ""jaded"" in that so many authors have become predictable and stale for me. Not so the case with Clare. Her characters seemed REAL and her plots were intricately developed so as to be believable. As a result, I felt really tied to this story. I laughed with it, I cried with it, I completely and thoroughly enjoyed it! I'd give this one ""Sweet Release"" 4 Stars because of some minor points where I became frustrated with the hero, but it was nonetheless a great book. The other three: CARNAL GIFT, RIDE THE FIRE, and SURRENDER were all 5+ Stars for me. Awesome, awesome, awesome work! I'm a devoted Pamela Clare fan now."
4,My Mom LOVED it!,"I am not a fan of the ante-bellum South, but it was a good story. Historically accurate. Good book. I recommend it."
1,Ticket to Ride: A Beatles Tribute,"If you are a fan of the original 'French' Swingle Singers from the '60's beware of this. This is a new group of highly polished singers. Yes I am sure they are talented singers, it's just not the same as the original; SS. The current version of SS use zoo zoo zoo Esquivel type singing which is OK for Esquivel fans but has no place in the Swingle Singers sound. They should have really changed the name and clearly dated the packaging. This CD cover makes it look like lost recording archives when it absolutely is not. Not recommended unless you like Glee, perfect Pitch and all of that modern accapella stuff that is popular theses days."
1,New Christy Minstrels make Elevator music on LSD!,"Perhaps the strangest album ever recorded next to Lou Reed's machine metal music (2 vinyl discs of amplifier feedback).The singers harmonize as well as the 5th Dimension, the Association, or Peter, Paul and Mary but the results are anything but delicious. I mean how can you make a song like Revolution or I am the Walrus ... full of gut-wrenching emotion into something with no feeling whatsoever (other than nausia)? Well, take a listen ... these guys did it!"
4,Somewhat specific to geography but filled with good information,"I bought this to help understand and choose a site for my thesis in NYC, it came in handy. The price hurt a bit, esp for a grad student"
3,Pretty good for the casual PJ fan,"This is a pretty good compilation of songs for the casual Pearl Jam fan. This two CD set contains more than their big hits that people have heard on the radio. However, hardcore fans (such as myself) will probably have all of these songs anyway. If you are anything like me, you already have all of their albums and have probably created your own personal ""Best of"" compilation. So if you just kind of like PJ or are not sure if you would like PJ, then get this set. But people who absolutely love PJ should just get all of their albums and decide for yourself which songs are their ""Greatest Hits."""
5,A MUST OWN,"""Even Flow"" is the re-recorded ""video version"" from back in '92. It's not a new version. Thanks."
4,Good,"I was never a big Pearl Jam fan, but I was going to buy a few songs on itunes, so I decided just to buy the CD. It is a good listen with some solid tracks."
4,Good overview of the band,"Pearl Jamrearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991-2003)This 2 CD set has all the songs we remember from the radio and several fine examples of their overall work. This is an important set in the history of the `grunge' movement but as a hits package, I like it more than love it. Four Stars."
5,Great,"Neil and Pearl Jam releasing greatest hits on the same day...pure heaven...this is a great guide to pearl jam...one of the coolest concepts of a greatest hits disc...First disc is the ""Up Side"" with all of the rockers...Disc two is ""Down Side"" with all the great mellow songs...one of the all time greatest bands hands down"
4,"Great tracks, annoying sleeve","Great tracks. As a noob to PJ it seems to be a great corss section.There are a lot of tracks on the disk so it's great value for money.I'd prefer it if the sleeve was a proper jewel case and not a cardboard thin sleeve.I was led to believe that PJ would sound like Nirvana, by them both being dubbed ""grunge"". NO WAY! PJ are so much better than Nirvana. For a start, they can play the guitar and sing. If you are looking for a Nirvana-like sound, this is probably not for you. If you want GOOD music, buy this!"
2,Uneccessary.,"Completley uneccesary release.I think they were forced to do this anyway (part of the contract)Best Pearl Jam albums : Binural, Riot Act, Yield."
2,"Average,but a Heck of a Marketed Group","I only liked a Little of Pearl Jam back when they were Hot in the early 90's as part of the Seattle scene&Sound. Eddie Veddar was the focal Point of the Band. in truth there wasn't alot of edge to there Music,but they Hit with some songs that made you think a Little Bit. now Pearl Jam's true Legacy is the OffSpring of :Hootie&the BlowFish,Stone Temple Pilots,Creed&Knickleback all Acts sound like Pearl Jam Knockoffs. that to me is there Impact. they pretty much peaked out after 1994."
2,Safe and middle-of-the-road,"For a band self-styled on being contrarian, this collection reveals Pearl Jam as safe and middle-of-the-road. Disc 1 (""Up"") contains more rocking fare, including the requisite anthems from ""Ten,"" as well as ""hits"" from the band's increasingly anti-commercial output afterwards. Quirkier moments like ""Do the Evolution"" stand out amongst largely generic blues-based rock. Disc 2 (""Down"") contains more pensive material, and is downright miserable, skirting perilously close to Hootie and the Blowfish. Blatant ripoffs of Neil Young (""Not for You"") and Led Zeppelin (""Given to Fly"") also detract."
5,"A Quick Look in the ""Rearviewmirror""","First off, every single Pearl Jam album is packed full of wonderful, amazing music. Therefore, there can be no exception here. As a hardcore Pearl Jam fan, it is certain that I have some favorites that weren't ""hits"" by Epic's standards, but I don't really feel disappointed that they were left off; after all, the true fans can keep ""Porch"", ""Indifference"", ""Whipping"", ""Lukin"", ""Low Light"", ""Gods Dice"", and ""All or None"" (as well as so, so many freakin' others) to ourselves. Besides, any upright Pearl Jam fan will own their favorites already and won't necessarily need this album. However, from a collector's standpoint, it's still a must have. This album also appeals to the not-so-hardcore fans in that it offers basically only what radio stations play or might have played at one time; no outlandish surprises here.Any which way you look at it though, ""Rearviewmirror"" is no less than Pearl Jam at its most exceptional. No let down here."
2,Not-Greatest Hits,"funny how bands rarely release Greatest Hits albums when they are on their creative and popular peak.Usually they release Greatest Hits albums when its over(Stone Temple Pilots,Creed,Korn,etc).I would put this below the Nirvana,Soundgarden and Alice in Chains best of's.The problem with Pearl Jam is that because they once were the biggest and most mainstream of the Seattle-Grunge bands,you simply get tired of hearing their radio hits,while some of the lesser known singles are not worth hearing."
1,Hurl Jam - aka better off not reviewed,Why do we need this. It's not like the band hasn't made their material (studio and live) readily available to their fans. Is this release just to harvest the last holdouts who don't really appreciate the band but want to have a few morsels to enjoy occasionally.
5,My Heart Races Just Holding This Damn Thing,"I can be seen grinning like a moron at just the FACT of this hits album. They continue to be one of (if not THE) smartest, most talented, most lovable bands playing today. Every song here is a gem, but of course, to a fan(atic) like me, every song they've ever recorded is priceless. I'm soooooo happy!!!!!!! I think I'm gonna puke. ;-)"
4,A more than solid retrospective of a legendary band,"""Rearviewmirror"" is about what you'd expect from a career-spanning retrospective of one of the greatest and most sucessful bands of the 90's. This double disc set features just about all the songs you'd expect to be on a Pearl Jam greatest hits album; from ""Jeremy"" to ""Alive"" to ""Black"" to ""Glorified G"" to ""Do the Evolution"", they're all here and they all sound great. There's no unreleased or new material included here as bonuses, which is a disapointment, but that's why there's ""Lost Dogs"", and Brendan O'Brien's remixes of ""Once"", ""Black"", and ""Jeremy"", which are decent. Hardcore fans will nit-pick over what's been included here and what hasn't, but for casual fans or new fans to the band, ""rearviewmirror"" is a more than worthy and solid entry point to one of the best and most influential groups to come out of the 90's."
5,Pearl Jam the BOMB!!!,"When I bought the 2 discs cd I thought it wouldn't be about nothing. But I was sooooo wrong this is the best collection of songs by Pearl Jam I am so glad that I bought this cd. My favorites are 'Garden','Jermey' and 'Once'. I like how the first cd is set up and the second cd is its like the songs are in order. I really recommend this to anyone that into 90's alternative rock. :-)"
3,better than expected,"I know I'd probably get a lot of ""flak"" for this, but I think ""Ten"" is the only good album that Pearl Jam ever released. It was a masterpiece. However, with each following release, PJ became so boring and formulaic in their never-ending quest to sound like a typical ""garage band."" Plus their annoying political aspirations are such a turn-off. They never captured my attention again. After ""Ten"" they were a major ""let-down."" Of course, every once in a while, they'd release a decent song or two that I'd like. The only problem was that these few songs were ""sandwiched"" in between a bunch of crap.Thankfully, with this release, we have most of those decent songs now without having to buy the mediocre albums that they first appeared on. I'm especially pleased that they included the two singles off of the ""Singles"" motion picture soundtrack.My major complaint with this collection are the ""remixes"" of the songs from ""Ten"" that Brendan O'Brien re-tooled. The songs were perfect ""as is."""
4,"I have no idea what Brendan O'Brien was thinking,,,","I love Pearl Jam. Nothing more to say about the band.I was comparing the remix by O'Brien versus what was released on ""Ten"", and all I can ask is, ""what was he thinking?"".I can see where he was going. It seems he brought the guitars/instruments to the forefront, but it really took away from the main melody of the tracks he remixed.I get it; he's a pro, I'm not. He makes hundreds of thousands doing what he does. But seriously? I prefer the released ""Ten"" tracks.The stereo mix is confusing. The melody is buried. The nuances that existed in ""Ten"" now sound like mistakes. I'm glad he didn't remix the other tracks."
5,Pearl Jam: The Essential 'Hits' Album,"I am totally a fan and devoted to the music of Pearl Jam. The albums 'Ten' and 'Vitalogy' were successes and the one's that made me fully appreciate the uniqueness of this great alt rock band. This is the Essential 2 CD album of the hits of Pearl Jam taking songs from all the albums 30 in all.There is no new material or new songs, just the old stuff. And the old material is what made PO what they are today. The rock kings next to Red Hot Chili Peppers. The compilation starts off with some of the best hits like Once, Even Flow and Jeremy and end also with classic hits like Last Kiss, Wishlist, Man of the Hour and Given.The CD is a must for any fan and I absolutely love it and Ed Vedder you have a great deep rich voice."
4,Great but why the remixes?,"I've been a fan since even before they became ""Pearl Jam"" and have followed them religiously through their first four albums. I lost touch but this compilation is great in reminding me of my old favorites and introducing me to their recent work. I love how it's broken down into two discs. ""Upside"" features their fast hard paced works and ""Downside"" features their more methodical ballad type songs. It's a great collection. The thing I wasn't too fond of was the remixes. The remixes seem to lose something that the originals captured beautifully. Regardless, this CD is still a must have."
3,Please make the writing bigger,"The book talks about a lot of plays by today's playwrights like Albee, Beckett, Churchill, and other paywrights of the 20th century. The book itself is just printed so small that it hurts your eyes as you read it. The best plays in this book were The Zoo Story by Albee, The Lesson by Gilbert, and Top Girls by Churchill. So if you want hear some contemporary writing from this book, read these plays. I only wish the print was a little bigger."
2,I was very disappointed,"Frommer's is still trying to pack two very large states into 448 small pages. This new edition offers little difference from the last edition. They've obviously left a lot out. If you like going only where the tourists with money go, this book is adequate. Otherwise save your money. It's a good highlights book, but very weak for usable information."
4,Coca Powder,"This coca powder is flavorful and aromatic, tasting rich and fresh. It is pricey though, so won't do for an everyday tea (quality teas such as green or oolong cost about one fifth the price for the same quantity)."
5,good stuff!!,"i really like this powdered tea it taste good mixed with soda, and is better than coffee.thank you for a great product."
4,A cult flick from Belgium!,"Certainly, this horror-thriller has much in common with Robin Hardy's Wicker man"" from 1973.But his director Pieter van Heees handles with absolute solvence the camera to tell us by stages, this cryptic tale that envolves murders related with pagan fertility rites.A sect established by devoted followers must offer a victim for getting fertility. Every seven years.Watch it, it will shock you. Good acting by Eline Kuppens."
1,Unexpected,The music is okay but nothing exceptional and definitly not worth the amount charged for it. Since I was actually searching under DVD's I was not really expecting a music CD.
5,the 7 year cycle finally explained,"I usually don't write reviews, but I really likes this book. I've read it twice now and the information contained in ""Saturn in Transit"" explained so much of what I have experienced, mostly in 7 year cycles (when Saturn adversly affected a 4 planet stellium I have). I've studied astrology off and on for a few years and knew there had to be a reason for the drastic changes, but until I read this book, I didn't connect what or how to deal with it..So now I am prepared for 2006! LOL. The book shed light not only on my craziness, but on the actions and feelings of lots of my friends too!"
5,Fantastic Customer Service,"I love my bowling shirts. They wash an wear easily. Plus the customer svc was fantastic with no delays in delivery. I will use them again,"
5,Another absolute must for fans of Penderecki!,"My continuing fascination with Penderecki's music led me to purchase this recording of his 2nd & 4th Symphonies. Unlike the 1st Symphony, which had a very Avant-garde approach to structure and tone, the 2nd & 4th Symphonies are more neo-romantic and less modernistic. And even though they have a less atmospheric tone, both symphonies are still dark and grim. A few segments may be a bit too bombastic, but the rest of the music is a treat for the ears. These two recordings are very good: they don't lack tension, and nor do they lack lyricism. Antoni Wit, as usual, conducts these with pure heart and soul, while the Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra gives fantastic performances of both works.Grade: A-"
3,"Loud, Melodramatic, & Brooding","Some of this music is so over the top I can't possibly take it seriously; having said that, it's fun to listen to every once in a while. Lots of loud horn-blowing and gong hitting. This CD finds Penderecki writing music that is late-Romantic and yet as violent and brooding as he can muster. There are moments in which it has the kind of frantic mania that I suppose one could find in Shostakovich, but as I listen to it I find it easier to think of as a really angry version of Szymanowski. If you like over-the-top late-Romantic music, this CD is for you."
5,Truly classical,"This game is truly a very good and classical games. It's all about remembering the past. Like Final Fight, Street Fighter II series and Ghost'n Goblins series. I like Street Fighter II series. This is of course, billiant game in the past. For the Ghost'n Goblins series, I only like the Super Ghouls'n Ghosts, because this game remembers the most. However, other games are good and it is still a good recommendation."
3,Best new classic arcade game collection ever made.,"The one thing I like about this game is that it has 2 versions of Street Fighter II on this game. I mean I played the original version of Street Fighter II on the Super Nintendo but the list of fighters where short. Here is what I'm saying about the Characters. It only has,Ryu, Honda, Blanka, Guile, Ken, Zangief, Chun Li, and Dhalsim.But the main problem is that you cannot control Balrog, Vega, Sagat, and Capcoms #1 Bad guy M.Bison. So if you want to play another version of Street Fighter 2 play this game or Capcom Fighting Evolution."
1,crapcom classics,$20 for a collection of CRAP!!! This is the worst compilation I ever seen. All three Street Fighter games (main reason why I wasted my money) were badly imported!!! Not responsive to controllers and EXTREMLY CHEESY!!! I've been playing Street Fighter II since it first came out in the arcades and the other game systems and this is by far the worst version of these game!!! Please save your money!!!
5,A Treat From The Past,"First off the main reason I was excited about this release is for $20 you get three of the greatest games from the past ever well ok one game 2 upgrades of course I am talking about Street Fighter 2, Champion and Hyper edditions I spent so many quarters and money on these games growing up at the local 7-11 or party store. I was going to by the Street Fighter Aniversary but kept putting it off because it mixed all three together here you get all three separate from one another in all their glory. Also Ghosts N Goblins, Ghouls N Ghosts great Final Fight and many more well worth the money I must also thank Capcom for this disc I love it."
4,I don't play this my kids do,I have a 7 year old and two 4 year olds. This collection of games keeps them occupied for a while and even my four yr old understands how to play. winner
5,classics I can play again,"Love these retro collections. Liked the Genesis games, but they always crashed. Now I can play them again on my PS2!"
1,Will not last - NOT ALL WEATHER,"This are not built to take the elements. They lasted one season in my boat - they came in it from the factory - that should tell you how cheap they are. The only way I would put them in my boat again is if it was in a totally protected environment, and then only if I was really cheap. Don't go for these, and don't go for anything ""dual cone"" they are not quality, they are cheap."
4,For the boat,I Purchased these to replace a set of existing speakers of same make and model number they fit like a glove and work great
2,Couldn't hang,"Sound was not that great. These deteriorated as quickly as any other speakers, this was my second or third pair. Would not buy again. Replaced them with MTX Audio speaker and despite some fitment issues due to the large magnet, like these much better and they seem to be wearing better as well."
1,sony xs-mp1610w,"Speakers sounded okay when installed. However for ""marine"" speakers they are now toast about two years later. The cones cracked and flake apart. They were installed in a boat but they were not in sunlight and were out of rain. Well protected from the weather. Complete waste of money. I tried to call Sony and was told I'd be emailed info on where to send them in Texas for service. I never received the email. I tried to call again and I was given a number for the center in Laredo TX where the voicemail hung up on me repeatedly. Don't make the same mistake.."
5,Well worth the hunt to buy....,"I reread this book every couple of years. This is an must read for any true crime junkie. It was so well written and showed all sides of the story. It made me realize random acts of violence against women was the ""high"" for these two idoits. They killed women they knew as well as someone they just spotted on the street. They were cold blooded murderers ...and ended up where they needed to be... a premanet resident of the state prison. As a female it made me more aware of my surroundings and I never get out of my car without looking around first for weirdo's lurking. :)"
3,Strange,"I don't know who is stranger? This author or Angelo Buono. The biggest hero in this book is a alcoholic philandering cop who, when he gets liquored up he shoots off his gun. I am inclined to believe Angelo Buono was innocent after reading this geeks view of the world."
4,Great lens with one important flaw,"I love this lens. It is very fast and extremely sharp. However, after getting the lens I had to send it to Sigma in NJ for a software adjustment so that it would not freeze on my F100. Seems that after about three minutes of HSM focusing on F100s the Sigma lens freezes. It can be unfrozen by turning the power on the camera off and on, but that's a pain. Sigma repaired it very quickly and I now love it. I use a 1.4x Sigma converter with it and very much like the combination.This lens is big and heavy, but very sturdy in feel and wonderfully bright. I feel it is a great alternative to the Nikon silent wave version with is almost twice as expensive."
2,A poor example of it's genre,"This is not the best of the spoken word genre. His stories are not particularly creative, lyrical or really all that interesting. While it's easy to relate to some of his tunes, especially for a connecticutt suburbanite like me, these little tales are simply unoriginal and doesn't take a whole lot of thought. There are two tracks I love, suicide is interesting as hell, edgy, awesome. Out the Window is the best track, haunting music, and ulitimatly disturbing. The words of claustraphobia, well, you can feel it in your bones. It's a truly affecting track, bleak, it gives me the shivers. The rest of the songs, again, just dont' do it. The music is aweful, truly poor. If you want to hear some good, unique, thoughtful, truly funny or truly beautiful or truly sad spoken word set to good music then try Maggie Estep or King Missile. Those are actualy albums, this is just a stupid little collection of anecdotes that anyone could have written."
4,"Great CD, not country",This LeAnn Rimes CD is great. I am not a country fan but I like LeAnn's voice. I have become a big fan after she did music for Coyote Ugly and now have many of her CD's. This one is my favorite though because of the variation of songs. The song from the Olympics was on here as well as remixes and soundtrack songs. I could not find this CD in stores either. There is another version without a bunch of the songs and remixes but this one is better cause of the added songs. I was glad Amazon had it so that I could buy it.
1,Get Back to Country Music,I was very disappointed when I played this CD. I love LeAnn Rimes' music but this CD reminded me of rock music rather than country music. LeAnn may be trying to get to all audiences but she needs to stick strictly to country music in my opinion. If you want true country music I would think twice about purchasing this CD.
1,"Just buy the Single ""I Need You""","I purchased this album mainly because of the track ""I Need You"" which has been playing on country radio for several months. It's a gem of a song and one I wanted as part of my music collection.Unfortunately, the remaining tracks are a hodge podge of garbage. I didn't realize the controversy swirling around the release of this album until after I purchased it. If you own any other LeAnn albums it will be clear to you after listening to this one that this album was released without her artistic input.I definitely do not recommmend it. If anything, just get the Single to ""I Need You"" (if you can find it) and save a few bucks."
2,Sugary production masks her power...,"If you really want to hear her sing, go listen/watch her perform these same song in the Music in High Places series where she performs these same songs acoustically with her band in the Yukaton. It's at musicinhighplaces.com - there you will see the real power that often hides behind the sugary production so prevalent in pop and ""new"" country. But Leann - it doesn't have to be so! You have an awesome, expressive really high quality voice- think Dixie Chicks realism - get back to the roots - you've got the material and the talent. This album is really bland, and mainly because of the production - I love the song ""Can't fight the moonlight"" as she performed it acoustically - please go check that out! It's a great series!"
1,please do NOT buy this cd,"this cd was brought out without leann rimes consent. it contains songs that were ""not good enough"" for previuos albums as well as some newer songs. to find out more visit rimestimes.com. again- leann rimes did not know this album was coming out and in no way does it reflect her talent so don't go dissing on her!"
3,"THERE IS SHANIA,FAITH & LEANN THE TOP 3","THIS CD BY {LEANN RHYMES} SHOWS THAT SHANIA TWAIN & FAITH HILL ARE NOT THE ONLY ARTIST'S THAT CAN TURN COUNTRY INTO POP;WITH MASSIVE SUCCESS.LEANN RHYMES DID A FLAWLESS DUET WITH ELTON JOHN THAT IS ON THIS CD;THE SONG ""WRITTEN IN THE STARS"" IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE DUETS OF ALL TIME.THIS CD IS A MIXTURE OF COUNTRY,POP & THE FOUR BONUS SONG'S EVEN SOUND LIKE THEY ARE MEANT FOR THE DANCE CLUB;AND THEY PULL IT OFF GREAT.THIS IS MY FAVORITE LEANN RIMES CD;IT IS A CD FOR ALL TYPES OF MUSIC LOVERS;GIVE IT A TRY AND YOU WILL BECOME A FAN!.{ROME,NEW YORK}"
3,leann-rhymes a dime,"I have been a country enthusiast all my life,& was overjoyed when Leann was discovered,a wonderful talent,very touching vocals.she went down well with the Genre,her previous album of great country songs was pretty good.I feel this album has been a let down of her talent,I only hope that she bounces back to the top sticking to her country roots."
2,Badly slapped together album!,"I can see why Leann Rimes didn't want this album to come out. This album is badly thrown and slapped together. There are some good numbers here like I Need You and Can't Fight the Moonlight and her Elton John duet, but the listening of it is a bland feeling. The Diane Warren songs borderline on sap and the other songs don't fit with her voice. I suggest that you listen to this CD one time, then throw it out the window. Just because she did some songs for soundtrack albums doesn't mean that you have to throw an album together for the public. People see through that stuff and stay away from it!"
5,Perfect fit for the Nokia 8260,"I'd just like to add that this case is a ""perfect"" fit for the Nokia 8260. It's not just a matter of the phone fitting in another phone's case, the 8260's charging port lines up exactly with the hole in the case. The clip is also very secure which is nice. Love it!"
2,disapointing,From the reveiws I expected it to be very sexy & arousing. It wasn't much of either. It was very boring. It got a two because of the ample nudity. Nothing else of note to say about this movie other than to say when they do an english version of an italian movie it should should not be cut. I think brass thinks americans would not like the full italian version so he does a toned down english version which takes away from the movies. Do not buy english versions of italian movies.
2,two disk edition not worth your attention,"I bought this edition because I wanted to see short flick--big disappointment--his previous seria of short movies is much better.Main problem is complete lack of imagination, repetition of old ideas, idiotic inclusion of dicks, lousy choice of music etc.Its possible maestro run out of fresh ideas but its not my problem-I wanna see masterpiece."
2,Really not that good.,"This video has a very boring story line, and the main character is quite silly. I would not call this very ""pornographic"" at all!"
3,"Wax drips from the candles, but Battle's singing is enchanting","This 1986 Mozart Requiem from Paris is about par with other old-fashioned, large-scale performances. That style has become extinct over the past decade and was bowing out even as Barenboim tried to out-Karajan Karajan in wieght and grandeur. He does a good job at romanticizing and underlining every line, if that's what you are looking for. The sonorities are rich as chocolate, although I'm not sure everyone will like the pugnacious accents that sometimes erupt from the chorus.To me, the only reason to stop and pause for a moment is the exquisite singing of Kathleen Battle, then at the peak of her career. She really was an enchanting singer, at her best in sacred music. The soprano doesn't get any more to sing than the other soloists, but her every entrance is magic."
4,Kathleen BATTLE is magical as always !!!!,"Thank you Kathleen Battle for making another masterful recording.Mozart's requiem is an excellent work,and this particular version is well recorded too.I just wish mozart wrote more music for the soprano to sing in his requiem.I must say that Verdi's requiem is the greatest ever composed,but thus far of all the requiems i've listened to,mozart's requiem must come in second.Mozart,you go boy!!Kathleen,you go girl!!!! Ps,requiems should be listened to especially on rainy evenings & nights with some introspective thoughts.Perhaps,mozart is now composing an anti-requiem for the afterlife."
4,An informative two-column quick reference guide.,"This informative little 55 page paperback book gives summary comparisons of business practices in China versus the United States. The authors' presentation is made in a two column style throughout the book. The left-hand column is for United States normal business practices, protocols, and social customs; whereas, the right-hand column presents the complementary practices, protocols, and social customs in China. The book is designed as a quick reference pocket book. Chapter headings are: 1. Welcome to Business China 2. The Global Marketplace 3. Doing Business in a Global Marketplace 4. The Chinese Culture 5. Chinese Business Etiquette 6. Chinese Gestures 7. Communication Interferences 8. Succeeding in International Business 9. Quick Tips: China 10. Common Phrases"
4,Wonderful Little Book,"This one was a joy to read. Like one reviewer said ""another book about books."" (My, I do love those). This is a absolute delight to read though. It is funny, flows well and most of all, is highly entertaining. So many works written near or at the turn of the last century are burried, seldom read and difficult to find. It is a pitty. There are so many wonderful, little known works out there, that simply are not in the public eye as they deserve to be. This is one of them. Highly recommend this one."
4,An excellent book with a misleading cover.,"I would give this book a perfect score were it not for the fact that the title and cover material does not represent the book's contents entirely accurately, so some readers may feel misled. The book presents itself as a practical guide for home-based businesses when in fact it is more of a self-help success guide in the genre of ""Think and Grow Rich"". This may be exactly what most aspiring home-businesspeople need; still, I would imagine that readers seeking practical specifics may be disappointed.As a self-help success guide, however, this is a fantastic book; one of the best I've ever read. It contains no original or revolutionary ideas. Instead, it distills the best ideas of the countless success manuals written over the past 100 years into a clear and logically consistent philosophy, and applies this philosophy to the subject of self-employment."
5,A must read for anyone in business or those who want to be,"How many times have you heard someone lament; ""Oh someday I'll go into business for myself."" Interest but no direction.This book gives you the direction and the motivation to make that ""someday"" today.A great read. I also highly recommend Direct from Dell"" by Michael Dell, another inspiring book that will get you off your duff."
5,Awesome!,"Whoa! Who could imagine that a little, world-less children's book could have been turned in such an amazing little film. ""The Snowman"" from start to finish is breath taking, the animation is the most beautiful pencil drawn style ever and the music is outstanding. Just like in Raymond's book, this film doesn't have any dialogue, just one song, which by the way has to be one of the most beautiful melodies ever created, that song is 'Walking in the Air'. The plot of the film is simply, a little boy's snowman comes to life one Christmas night and takes him into a midnight adventure of winter wonderland. This film is a great film to play during the winter holidays, certainly not a film you can watch over and over all year long, but sure comes fresh out of the box each Christmas."
3,Exercise Caution,"This is an interesting story, and the animation does carry a certain charm. The pace is well done, and it does hold your interest. I feel obligated to point this out though. For you parents out there reading this, the ending is very sad, and I feel you should watch it first and then decide if your children should watch it."
5,INSPIRATIONAL !,"I first saw this annimated short story on PBS on a snowy Christmas Eve late at night in Chicago. The music is excellent and helps transpose you to an era of Christmastime that is not spent in malls and traffic. As David Bowie states; ""you see, it was a real snowman!"""
5,The Snowman DVD,"Exactly what I wanted to replace a video tape from long ago. Very pleased with condition of product when I recieved it. It took a little longer to recieve it than I would have wanted, but I'm probably more patient than most people."
5,After 15 years...still blows me away.,"This film transcends all barriers of race, creed, religion, gender, time, etc...its about being a KID (boy or girl) and having imagination and dreams...I first saw this film in 1984, when I was on my way up......was working in Lafayette, La., USA...I cried then (I was 28yo)...I still do every time I watch it...it kills me."
5,Perfect from the first snowflake 'till the spring thaw....,"Our family began watching this video on a daily basis back in November - in synch with the early snowfalls of upstate NY. Each subsequent snowstorm brings cries of ""noman! noman!"" from my 2 year old. The film is truly captivating. A gentle film that moves at a noticibly slower yet welcome pace. Highly recommended!"
2,Beautiful story but lousy copy quality,"This story has become a holiday family favorite for 18 years at least. After our VHS machine became useable we sought the movie on DVD. The color quality of this item is very poor compared to the original versions I have seen on TV and the old VHS copy we had. The three DVDs I recently purchased are very disappointing, given the style of animation (hand drawn, colored pencil medium). It may as well have been in black and white..."
2,My toddler and visiting friends wept!,"After all those responses from enthralled viewers, I hate to be the voice of doom, but...We received the video as a gift and unfortunately I didn't preview it first. The toddlers wept! They cried and cried at the somewhat harsh and undeniably sad ending. Okay, the artwork and music can be inspiring, but if you want to keep any sensitive toddlers happy this season, view it alone!"
2,Just so-so,"This movie is just so-so.The animation is blurry,but the story is fair.This may keep kids entertained for about 10 minutes or so,then they'll get bored and go do something else.Only rent this if you're truly bored and there's nothing good on TV."
1,1 star is the top,This movie was the most boring 23 minutes in my life. The only reason I read it was because I have a school project too do. Theres no talking in the movie which is very boring! If you want to see a good movie you should watch pirates of the caribbean 'the curse of the black peurl'. Thats an interesting movie with lots of action.
5,This is what Christmas is all about,"Utter class, animation drawn purely by hand, a soundtrack that sweeps you from one emotion to the next plus great aerial shots of Southern England! (notice Brighton Pavillion) Aled Jones' voice on ""Walking in the air"" just gives me goosebumps. My little boy is just coming upto one so by Christmas I reckon he'll be able to enjoy The Snowman. I can't wait."
1,Revisionist Version--BE WARNED,"We bought this thinking it would be the same thing as what we had once had on VHS. This version is not the one with David Bowie (as mentioned by other reviewers), but far worse are the changes made the the ""Father Christmas"" story. It's as if some ultra-politically-correct editor redid the whole story. Gone are all of the things that made the original version great--the cranky Father Christmas, all of the ""Bloomin""s, and any scene in which Father Christmas (gasp!) drinks alcohol or shows his backside. It's a really depressing example of how a ""Holier Than Thou"" editor can make some many changes to a story that it becomes the opposite of what was intended. If you want to see the original version, it can still be found in its full length on YouTube."
5,The gentle story of a boy and a snowman,"This is one of the gentlest, most beautiful movies for any age that I have seen. I love it as much as my four year old. The music, drawing and story are soft, warm and deeply moving. The grownups cried and our son was transfixed. It is simple but can be seen again and again. Not to be missed. There is some Christmas-related material, but it is incidental so the film can be said to be nonsectarian. A gem."
2,A bit disappointed.,I was dissappointed that this dvd was not narrated by David Bowie. He did a introduction in the beginning of this movie but a different voice narrated the movie. The original vhs movie was narrated by him throughout the whole movie.
5,Fantastic,My son and I love to sit and watch this video....it's simply magical. The music is inspiring. Curl up with a cup of hot cocoa and a loved one and immerse yourself in fantasy.
5,Great Gift,"My son loved The Snowman when he was only a year old. And two. And three. And now four, and he still loves to watch. Some of my fondest memories will forever be snuggling up with him back when he was so tiny and watching The Snowman. And his little voice saying, ""Owl"", at the beginning, and being amazed that he knew that.I am still enchanted with the wonderful animation and beautiful music. I've probably watched it 100 times, and will probably watch it 100 more.We have given away several copies as gifts. It's a sure winner."
5,Most outstanding!,"I am a kindergarten teacher. I do not show movies in my classroom. Except ""The Snowman."" It is truly an amazing movie. This film mesmerizes the children in my class. There are no words, only the most lovely music and pictures. I wanted my little friend to see the movie, so I brought it home. My husband sat down with him and fell in love with the movie. I am buying the movie for my husband and my grandchild to be for Christmas this year. I hope you all have the chance to see and hear this movie, the music and the pictures will stay with you every day of your life. Enjoy!"
2,False advertising by amazon,"What a delightful tale this is, too bad it is missing the warm and wonderful intro by David Bowie THAT IT CLAIMS TO HAVE ON IT BUT DOES NOT!!!! The David Bowie bit was the main reason I bought this, I already have it on tape. He should not be listed in the credits in the description nor on the DVD itself, false advertising, shame on Amazon. In fact looking at this very page it says by "".....David Bowie..."", ridiculous."
5,Lovely film,"Purchased to replace a VHS tape. Almost wordless movie, uses a child's imagination and the animation to tell the tale. One of the few short films I was willing to use at my preschool as a last day before Christmas break treat with popcorn and hot chocolate."
5,Wonderful,Such a lovely story about a snowman who comes to life and takes a little boy on a trip into his world and back.
5,The Snowman,"This almost wordless account of a little boy's midnight encounter with his lovingly made snowman is classic. The enchantment comes partly from the artistry of color-crayon subtlety and partly from recognizing a dream's improbable sequences. Children and grownups are drawn into this beautiful, short remembrance of winter magic."
3,Not narrated by David Bowie,This version of THE SNOWMAN is not narrated by David Bowie. It is still an AWESOME movie- I was expecting David Bowie.
3,The Snowman [VHS],"I bought the movie, ""The Snowman"", on VHS after my first grade class ""read"" the book (there are no words in this story, just pictures). I thought they would enjoy seeing this story in a different format. The movie itself was great! Even though there was no speaking going on, like the book, it kept the children's attention. I was disappointed that the movie had a lot of background noise (like crackling) which detracted from the movie. This movie was bought new from a vendor."
4,Just what I was looking for.,"As a child I used to watch this all the time and I had not been able to find a good copy since. this video is exactly what I remember it being, I'm so happy."
5,The BEST Christmas movie ever!,The Snowman is a mesmerizing animated fantasy. The music is superb and the art is amazing! I have 5 children (who saw it when they were young) and 6 grandchildren who just discovered it. Some of them have watched it over 20 times in the last 2 months. This Christmas I made sure every family had one. Young and old alike -- We all love it! I highly recommend it.
4,The snowman. a DVD written by Raymond Briggs.,"This childrens Clasic, ""The Snowman"", should be on everyones Christmas wish list if they dont already own it.It is so charming, touching,light, fairy-like,and at the same time a DVD or book that anyone, child, teenager or adult,would love.A bit in the same way as Winnie the Pooh is not just for small children.I love it, and really bought it for myself, and my ""inner child!""I highly recommend it -buy it for YOUR inner child!"
5,"""We're flying through the air...""","Believe in magic.I was a young lad when I first saw ""the Snowman."" Watching cartoons like ""Silverhawks"" and ""The Mighty Orbots"" had left me jaded, cynical, and violence-prone. Following that course would have ended me up in heaps of trouble--I might've even been wanted by the C.I.A.!Fate intervened on a cold, wintry day in fourth grade, when our wonderful teacher treated us to an in-class video. Little hooligan that I was, I scoffed when the title ""the Snowman"" appeared. Before long, however, I was swept into a world of beauty, love, and swirling snow. I was transfixed by the image of the Snowman and the little boy soaring o'er the countryside, able to leave all their cares below.From that day, I've spread joy, peace and love to others. It amazes me that I was once so foolish and cruel. A simple, lovely cartoon changed all that.Believe in magic."
3,Where's David?,"This dvd doesn't have David Bowie introducing The Snowman, like I remember. I'm sad. It's still a beautiful film though."
5,Winter Classic,"United Airlines is currently running a commercial campaign using similar-looking animation -- when it dawned on me what those commercials were reminding me of, I had to dig this out. I first got this video via mail-order about 12 years ago, while at sea in an aircraft carrier during Christmas.The animated story is nice and charming enough, but what really kills me is the theme music. Haunting piano at the opening, and then with lyrics during the snowman's flight -- just the most beautiful music you'll ever hear."
5,Speaks Volumes in Its Simplicity,"Whenever I leave for home, after a family holiday, I always get a sense of bitter/sweet melancholy. ""The Snowman"" perfectly mirrors that feeling for me. The biggest reason for that, aside from the gentleness of the story as presented, is the incredible music. ""The Snowman"" is simple grandeur."
5,Raymond Briggs' The Snowman,This absolutely charming video has long been a favorite of mine. Family members and friends who have received & viewed it are aslo overwhelmingly delighted. It tells a story yet opens up the child's (or adult's) imagination. I wholeheartedly recommend it.
4,Delightful - no more to be said,"'The Snowman' has been required viewing in my house every Christmas since it was first broadcast in 1982. I wanted to introduce my American family to this quintessentially English story with its special magic. There is now a lovely photo of my 40+ nephew and his 18 month old daughter both equally entranced as they watched the DVD. Hopefully, a new Christmas tradition has been born.For those who don't know it, it's a magical tale of a young boy and the night when his snowman came to life. The film is virtually silent. There are a few introductory words from the author and Aled Jones singing 'Walking In the Air'. As my elder niece said ' Oh, that's where that's from.'One of the joys of the film is that it is drawn in the same style as the book.Enjoy!"
4,Good classic,"I remember watching this as a child and it completely gripped me back then. It was enchanting, I recall. Anyway it was played on TV last year and my 5 year old loved it. Definitely a classic and highly recommend viewing this."
5,This charming animation brings tears to my eyes,"This is not your typical Frosty/Rudolph kind of animation. Artfully crafted sketch animation is combined with a haunting musical score (including memorable vocals by a boy's choir) and a poignant story (told only visually and musically, no dialog) that is guaranteed to bring a tear to your eye."
5,I remember this film!,"I remember this film and yet in 1982 I was 3 years old. This film left a profound impact on me somehow. The story is excellent for children. A young boy builds a snowman and flies to the north pole for a snowman party and then returns. This was my first influence to tragedy as the snowman melted. (sorry if i ruined it for you) Also the piece ""Walking in the Air"" by George Winston is wonderfully beautiful!"
4,"Not a bad lounge collection, especially at this price","Calvert DeForest is better known as Larry ""Bud"" Melman from the David Letterman TV show, and he lent his name and image to this late 1990s lounge compliation CD. In terms of song selection, the quality is nearly as good as the Ultra-Lounge series. Given that this is a late 1990s-CD, the artwork and song selection also play up the then-current ""Austin Powers"" movies and this CD has a lot in common with the music from those films. In fact, if you walked into a room and heard this playing you'd probably assume it *was* the Austin Powers soundtrack CD. If you like what you're hearing so far, just get the CD. You won't regret it.If you're a Calvert DeForest fan, you'll appreciate his odd vocals on ""Tequila."" If you aren't a fan, don't worry - it's the last song on the CD and you can skip this typically surreal comedy.I paid two dollars for this CD brand-new in a lot warehouse, so you should be able to find a dirt-cheap used copy here."
4,Not your typical cocktail,"This compilation sports lots of 60s ""cool"" music spanning pure jazz to strange cocktail sounds. Calvert sings Tequila as if he were an 18 year old stud-muffin. More power to him. If you love to party retro-style, then this is the compilation for you. It sports a few selections not available anywhere else, so grab it, shake and stir!"
2,A disappointment,"I got this unit based on the positive feedback here on Amazon. I don't know if I got a lemon or what, but I'm very disappointed with it.First, the radio reception has a problem. One station is clearly audible over others regardless of the frequency setting. It's not a problem with any other radio in the house, even in the same spot.Second, it doesn't remember the volume setting when you turn it off. Turn it down quiet, then turn it off and on, and the volume is back up to blaring again. I have to adjust it every time. Very annoying.The iPod integration is ok, and the price is decent, but I really wish the radio worked properly."
3,Lovely Picture - But Small,"The painted portion of the poster is beautiful but is only about 22"" X 22"" and the rest is white paper with a few words (filling up the remaining 4' X 14""). I wish sellers would post the size of the picture not just the size of the entire poster. If I knew it was this small, I wouldn't have purchased it even though it is so pretty."
5,Surprise Kit,"I do a little soldering with my dollhouse miniatures and am just starting to use the LED lights which need resistors. I honestly missed the ""kit"" part of the description, but I will have to say, ""It was great experience at soldering!"" The instructions are excellent, easy for a beginner to follow and it went together like a charm. I would highly recommend it to anyone."
5,Great kit,I love these Elenco kits !! The overall kit quality is very high - with very high quality parts. The kit integrity is the best I've ever seen (all parts included exactly as described); and the instructions are PERFECT !! I have built a lot of electronic kits over the years - and none provide instructions this good. I built 5 of these kits in the last month - and there has not been 1 mistake; not one omitted part; not one wrong component value; and not one awkward or incorrect or out-of sequence build instruction. They especially excel at pointing out places where care needs to be taken due to a future step in the same area. And - they provide additional instructional information at just the right places in the instructions (resistor charts / capacitor value info / polarization codes on components - etc). Well done Elenco !!!
5,Superior form of zinc,"Amino acid chelates (glycinate) have superior bioavailability and Solgar is a reputable brand. And these are not just cheap chelated minerals--they use Albion Labs (they make high quality, fully reacted chelates)."
4,Heart warming,"Rick Telander spins the tale of a young boy who loves basketball, although he is not a great player. The boy comes from a troubled home and is not treated well by his coach. Still, the boy pushes onward with his dreams.The story is a pretty good story, but more important is Telander's writing style. Telander totally captures the mind and heart of the youngster. He obviously feels what this kid feels and he conveys that feeling beautifully to his audience all throughout the book. More than just reading the story, I walked away feeling a lot of the emotions."
5,On A Mission To Save The Third Street School,"Recess: School's Out is a 2000 Disney animated feature film based on the Disney Saturday cartoon series. In this comedy-adventure, the Recess gang(TJ, Spinelli, Vince, Gus, Mikey and Gretchen)discover that, during summer break, their school is under siege by a group of evil-doers led by a devious ex-principal, so the Recess crew joined forces with Prickly, Finster and the rest of the teachers to fight back and save the school. The special features includes music videos from the film and trailers of other great Disney favorites on DVD. Recess: School's Out is perfect for any fan of the Disney classic TV show. :)"
3,Ok until my 6yr old said Mom why want th police help TJ,I love recess and I enjoy watching the show with my son. We recently brought the movie and he really likes the movie but about the 10th time in a row he said Mom don't the Police helps when the bad guys are after you? I said yes he then asked so why did the laugh and not help TJ? I didn't have a straight answer for him. but I did work my my thourgh it. I just think Disney need to be more carefull with the message they are bring to different ages. I know a 10and olde child would understand but younger that that. But over I I like the movie however I can't rate this a 5 star in honor of my six year old who now ask 21 questions about Police all over again.
1,Another cartoon gone to the dumps!,"I'm a fan of the Saterday morning cartoon, and reading the first few reviews I thought the movie would be great! Sorry to say, I don't agree with anything that these people.I showed it to some kids that follow the show and they were mad too. the characters were out of line and the story was horrible. The kids are not supper heros...they don't beatup bad guys or lead armies. I wanted the movie, or be like, another episode."
1,Disney fails again,"After seeing ""Dinosaur"" i was very very dissapointed, now, i wanted to see, this movie, because i like very very much,the show, but believe me, this movie has one of the posts as the worst movies of the year 2001, the jokes are predictable and not funny, due because we have seen them very much times, by the way, the plot isn't original, and the same i think of the animation it's exactly the same we saw on ""Rugrats"""
5,An awesome movie for anyone!!!: Recess: Schools out.,"This may be a G-rated film geared at children esp. since the show was, but ANYONE can *enjoy* this film not just little kids,teens,or adults. BUT ANYONE!!! It has kickin music from the sixites allthough I'm sure not EVERYONE knows sixties music like I do since I grew up listening to it even though I'm ONLY 16yrs!!! But besides the GREAT music the MOVIES GREAT TOO!!! Be sure to watch the end credits its really cool and funny!!! I love the show recess and this movie has a cool plot!!! Like the show always has absurd plots. But that's what makes it so good!!! I wont give it away though... I'll just say your in for a treat!!! So rent or buy this today!!!God Bless ~Amy"
5,the tragic journey of a country-side girl in the big city,"Maimouna is an innocent and beautiful young girl, living with her old and caring mother in a village called Louga. As she grows up, she gets curious about life in the big city, Dakar, which is the capital. However, her complete innocence will only lead her to be a victim of life under the spolights..She will be back in town to heal her wounds nearby her loving mother..."
5,"So tiny, so cute, so perfect.","I purchased these as a ""unique"" gift for a candy loving family member. They are tiny, yes, but that is what makes them so perfect. Very unique package, very unique candy."
3,POOR LITTLE FIRST- MOTHER,"Poor George ! This book really surprised me. Is this based on facts? Good lesson on contentment. We should all count our blessings, daily. Mrs. Washington had many, yet she was blind to them.I WOULD STILL BUY THIS AS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF CHARACTER TRAITS."
2,Disappointing...not Jean Fritz's usual quality,"I am a fan of Jean Fritz, but I was disappointed with this book. It portrays Mrs. Washington in a very bad light, selfish, and greedy. While this may be true, I don't feel it is appropriate for this age level. Children this age should be taught to respect adults. If what Jean Fritz wrote about Mrs. Washington is true then I don't mind my children learning about it...when they are a bit older. Although this book was a disappointment, I do recommend other Fritz books such as George Wahington's Breakfast, and Shh! We're writing the Constitution."
1,Inappropriate book for children,"Not only is this book's central theme the negativity of Mary Washington, but it includes a graphic illustration of George Washington being hanged, which is over the top for a children's book (a daydream from Mary, who is constantly worried about George being hurt on the battlefield or by the British). Toward the end of the book you get the impression that Mary Washington was mentally unstable. The book had zero value and, as other reviewers have mentioned, has some grammatical problems to boot. This is a terrible book. It's inappropriate for children and has no value at any age level."
3,Thought I was purchasing a new CD,Could be my bad. I thought it was under the 'new' column. It came opened and a crack in the jewel case.
1,Not consistently tasteful enough to be one of the greats ...................,"To my way of thinking this is a truly horrible album. He can't resist the temptation to show off on every tune. You won't hear it on the samples but you will when you get the full versions.""Chicago Song"" is a fairly boring tune which goes on way too long, so long that they hacked two minutes off it when it went on ""The Best Of David Sanborn"".There is no doubt he's a top class player and composer, just listen to ""Carly's Song"" from ""Hideaway"". But so often when he has the opportunity to be as tasteful as he is there, he can't seem to pull his head in, and plays too cute, too loud, or too much - and quite often all three at the same time."
2,Poorly Written,"This book is poorly written with no editing done whatsoever. There are constant misspellings and grammatical errors that detract from the book. Although there are some interesting aspects to the book, I could not get over the way it was written."
3,A good primer on email marketing,"As one reviewer said, this is a good ""entry level"" book on email marketing. It doesn't go too deeply into any one area of email and it is slightly outdated as I write this.The part of writing email is quite short and covers only the basics. I thought since Bob Bly was one of the authors, it might go deeper into that all-important area.Nonetheless, it's a good book and well worth the read, especially if you buy a used book for a few dollars.- Susanna K. Hutcheson"
3,Phone won't close,"This is a fine case except for the clear plastic that covers the keypad. This plastic cover is sandwiched in between the keypad and the earpiece flip cover and prevents the 8500 phone from closing as it was designed. With the phone closed in the case, the flip portion rests on top of the plastic and not flush to the body. Not only does this look like the phone is in the wrong case, but the resulting gap between the flip earpiece and the base could cause the phone to catch onto something, separating the flip cover from the base. Ouch!If you're looking for an excellent holster for the 8500 to wear on a belt, go for the plastic clip holster also sold by Amazon. That's a five star case. I traded my leather in for the plastic, never had the phone fall out, and never had a problem inserting or removing. A much better holster for belt wear. The leather is better for purse use."
1,Misleading,"This book is not much about the psychology of the market. In fact most of the text is changes in corporate finance over the years, boom/bust periods as in ""madness of crowds"". Lots of market history. There is no investing method per se, as stated in one review. It can be summed up as: trade with the trend, cut you losses, don't bet too much on one stock, and money goes where it is treated best. The market psychology is the same thing in other books.Because of the high praise this book recieved I was expecting some new insights or a different perspective on market psychology. Here it failed miserably. Pass on this one."
4,Solid Performance,"Beecham gives a very solid performance of Scheherazade, and I have no complaints. The recording is a little dated, however, and there are recordings of more recent origin having better technical sound quality. I partucularly like the newer release of Scheherazade by Philips, with Valery Gergiev conducting the Kirov Opera Orchestra."
5,"No Butterfly, He.","It is a curious coincidence that two of the most infamous paranormal designations - Flying Saucers and Mothman - were created by paid copywriters instead of paranormal researchers proper.Such is the evasive, egalitarian nature of Mothman and his impish (and sometimes sinister) ilk. They defy being trapped like butterflies under a glass jar by ""experts."" Classification eludes us. No one has yet managed to codify a taxonomy of these bizarre, reality-bending bandits.Loren Coleman is reminiscent of the best Fortean writers that precede him. He recognizes that definitions and explanations are impotent in the face of the inherently undefinable and inexplicable.Coleman's freedom from dogma allows him to offer multiple, simultaneous perspectives without falling into wide-eyed credulity.A jewel of the genre and worth every dollar of the price tag."
1,"Well Published, but Mistake-filled","The publisher of this book is to be commended, but the resercher is to be laughed at. The Jersey Devil had some interesting reading, but the Mothman section was nothing but rehash from books that preceded this one, such as The Mothman Prophecies by John Keel and MOTHMAN: The Facts Behind The Legend by Donnie Sergent Jr and Jeff Wamsley. I found several mistakes in the factual information concerning the Mothman research. Please do not buy this book with the expectations of getting the facts. It is a decent read for pure entertainment, but the factual mistakes are inexcusable."
5,Most disturbing yet brillant book ever!,MZB is one of the best authors! She spins such wonderful tales and this is no exeption. I could not put this book down it was absolutly fabulous!
2,Well...disappointed to say the least,"The idea was interesting, but I've seen it before. This is probably the worst fantasy book I've ever read. I don't want to give anything away (who knows -- you may feel the need to read it), but the plot was twisted and deranged, and the ending stunk. Sorry, fans!"
2,Inspired Characterization/Good Prose Style/Insipid Plot,"This book wove fascinating interrelations between the characters, but--oh no--not the whole lame quest for power/devil worship plot again."
5,it's one marion's best......,"This book is one of marion's best because she always knows how to keep us on our toes and wanting more. shee tells this story, and all the other stories I have read, on the side of the female character and not the male. I just hope that other women can learn from her and start writing as good a story as marion."
4,Great! I loved it.,"The story flowed well.The characters where dynamic and likeable. The storyline was interesting and well thought out. It might not have the flare of some of her other books, but it is a nice bridge to The Forest House."
3,a little disappointing,"I'm a great fan of MZB, and an even greater fan of her Darkover series, but I was a little disappointed with this one. Perhaps because it was written in her earlier years (I think), she does not write with the depth that I was expecting."
4,beautifully written,"This was the first book I have read of MZB, and I found it captivating. The characters seemed to be real people & had real emotions. I truly came to care about the characters and was surprised with them at the various twists and turns throughout the book. I wish that Micon had lived longer, but I knew when I started the book that he wasn't going to last long.A wonderful book."
2,Just not very good . . .,"After reading several of her books, this was a major flop. At no time was I swept away with the story as in ""The Firebrand."" At no time did I think ""now this could happen"" as in ""Mists of Avalon."" Nor would I ever want to return to its people or places as in ""Forest House."" This was not up to expectations. Certainly not up to the standards I have come to accept as Bradley's. I could not, would not, will not recommend this book to anyone"
2,What a disapointment...,"I was so disapointed about this one... I want you to know, though, that I've read all the MZB books, I love her style and my favourite book ever is ""Mysts of Avalon"", and ""FireBrand"" also. As the rest I find them not so good... but this... it simply isn't worth to read. As far as my opinion goes I believe that there's so much to write about Atlantis... It doesnt even appear to be written by MZB"
2,Not about Atlantis,"I read about half of this book. I didn't hate it; it just wasn't that interesting. I loved The Mists of Avalon and was intrigued by the Atlantis references in that book. I thought it would be fun to find out what really happened there and who the characters were. Unfortunately, the book doesn't take place in Atlantis - it takes place in Britain, among people who have settled there from Atlantis. That was disappointing. What's more, the characters just aren't that interesting. I expected more from Bradley."
4,PuzzleQuest,This is an addictive RPG that will keep people who likethis type of game busy for hours. Very relayable too.
4,"A great game, but slightly repetitive.","The DS has some very interesting, unique, original games being written for it, and Puzzle Quest is definitely one of them. It's part RPG, part puzzler. The story is not really all that interesting, and there's really only one type of puzzle, but there's something very different and fun about defeating monsters by playing them in a puzzle game. I only give it 4 stars because of the bland storyline and repetitive nature..but as you progress, and level up, you do get some interesting powers that make the puzzle playing more interesting. I definitely recommend it. Did I type the word ""puzzle"" enough in my review? Sorry about that."
4,Great twist to standard puzzle games,"I really enjoyed the RPG aspect that was incorporated into what could have been a rather typical puzzle game. The battles are interesting and fun, because you aren't just trying to win. You're also trying to collect money and experience based on what you do within the puzzle itself. I will say that the battles can get tedious after you've been playing the game for a while, but that's broken up with the different types of puzzles offered for crafting runes, capturing enemies and researching spells. All in all, a very addictive game that's also great fun."
4,Excellent Game,"Great game for both puzzle and rpg fans. If you have even the slightest inclination towards purchasing the game, I highly suggest you do and give it a shot...you won't regret it :-)"
2,Endless game of Bejeweled,"When I bought this game I was under the impression it consisted of a series of DIFFERENT puzzles. My fault for not doing enough researach. This game is a mind numbing endless game of Bejeweled. At least in regular RPGs when you get to a higher level the lower level characters are easy to beat and a fight doesn't last that long. This game however, takes an endless amount of time to complete a fight no matter what your level. I don't understand why there are so many high ratings on this game. If you like the idea of playing bejeweled over and over and over and over then you will like this game. There is no challenge and the story line is non existent."
5,"Old title, still a great game to play","Old title, still a great game to play for DS. Adults and kids alike love this game. It is truly a quest that builds as you collect weapons, other warriors in your party, experience, gold, skills, spells, etc. If you want to use your brain a little, try this for a change."
3,"Good, not great puzzle game","This game is pretty fun, but it gets old fast. It's basically Bejeweled on steroids, but if you don't already LOVE Bejeweled, this game won't make you love it. The RPG elements seem tacked on - there is no story to speak of, and that's usually the only reason I play RPGs. If you're looking for some hard Bejeweled with some leveling up, get this game. If you're not, don't."
3,Was going great... till it started freezing...,"I'm mixed on this game. I like it, it is unique... game play has a tendency to get a tad boring... especially for long sessions. Overall though... I do like it. The reason I am torn is because the other day (after only using the game for about a week or so) the game started to freeze (at really horrible times to freeze too...) It just stopped mid movement, has anyone else had this problem? Aywho... if you are a bejewled fan you'll like this... and it has a little rpg... so that helps make it interesting. It's not the best game ever... but it's pretty good."
2,This game is boring.,"I tried to like this game. I love RPG's, I love puzzle games. I played and played hoping it would get more interesting, but it didn't. It's the same lame puzzle over and over and over, and the RPG-side doesn't make up for it. It wasn't addictive at all, I had to force myself to keep playing. Cool idea for a game, this one's a failure. My guess is the people who rave about this game are more of the checkers type than chess."
2,Not what I expected,"This game is puzzle meets warrior. It is not what I expected when I purchased a puzzle game. You have to collect points to advance etc. You have to invest a lot more time than I am willing to get very far in the game, not the type you can just pick up occasionally and enjoy."
2,May be okay for some.,"My version is for the Nintendo DS lite. I did not really enjoy this game. Perhaps it is fun for some, but I did not find it to be. It is just a glorified ""Bejeweled"" game with a weak story line. Plus,it is somewhat difficult to understand the objective. I suppose you might enjoy it if you are a fan of fantasy games."
4,Great game,"This is more of a puzzle game than an RPG but it's really good if you like either genre. The storyline is ok, but it lasts a while and there are a lot of sidequests to keep you busy. You can also make items, capture monsters, memorize new spells from captured creatures, and train mounts so there is a lot of things to keep you busy.The game has pretty good graphics, but it's just a puzzle game so thats not really important. Controls are good, the stylus works excellent for this game. The music in my option, was awful. It was tasteful and appropriate to the game, maybe even pretty, but it got old quickly and it distorts badly if you turn it up at all. Luckily, you can just turn it off. Battling other players is really fun, sadly the game does not support wifi."
2,"Not usable if studs aren't on 18"" centers","My house was built with 24"" centers so I couldn't use these shelves. The holse they provided on the shelf will only work on 18"" centers.Let me know if anyone is interesed in some shelves."
2,"Really had problems with story, graphics, etc...","This game advertises all this stuff about how great it is, but it honestly isn't. I bought it to play with my boyfriend, and even he didn't like it. He is like Mikey, he likes anything.The graphics are choppy, the story is okay until it deviates into this weird part about people with glowing eyes, and the music isn't all that great.This is just my opinion, and I suggest you rent this game before you buy it."
2,Can be fun at times but graphics are poor and some sections just don't fit.,"This is a ""beat em up game."" and it's pretty fun at times, however there are certain sections that don't fit like entering passwords through a system of lights that you need to get to light up at the same time by hitting a certain combination of lights in order to open doors. This doesn't really fit with a beat em up game and makes it less fun as it's hard as hell to actually pull this off. It would be alot more entertaining to beat a boss up and take his key or key card per the rest of the game. The graphics on the box look better than the graphics in the actual game which are quite poor for 2006 or even any time. The original arcade version of final fight that was released nearly 20 years prior actually looks and plays better than this remake/sequel. The camera couldn't be worse and merely gets in your way."
3,"Good, but too short...","Final Fight: Streetwise is not worthy of the panning it got from the critics. On the other hand, it is both to short and has a somewhat schizophrenic design team. Still, it's a pretty worthy investment."
4,Confirmation of Glen Campbell on this CD,"This CD is fabulous. I was told that during the session days of recording in the 60's time frame, that Glen Campbell is somehow related to this CD. Did I miss something in the liner notes?? Can someone please confirm for me. Thank you, and the CD has a terrific track listing!Sounds great to me! Would recommend this CD to anyone."
3,More to discover,"I rated this CD with 3 stars because it missed out some great songs, like 'My first day alone', another great song besides 'Rhythm of the rain', which is composed by Chandler-McKendry (same composing team as 'Last leaf') and 'Dreaming', same one as recorded by Johnny Burnette, but better. I wish record companies should do more research in the reissue of back catalogue of the 50's & 60's as they always missed out some great stuff. Now the only way to have ""My first day alone"" and ""Dreaming"" is from the ""Collectable"" 2004 release of ""Rhythm of the Rain"" CD. Together with this ""Taragon"" CD , you almost have all the songs that the Cascades had recorded. (Updated Jan, 2008)"
4,a n underrated vocal group-more than a one hit wonder!,"I've always loved""rhythm of the rain"", the song most closely associated with this southern California vocal group. For most people I suspect, that's where it ends, and that's a shame, because the Cascades body of work, as evidenced in this excellent anthology deserves more credit. Lead singer John Gummoe's high sad voice is well served by the haunting melodies, most notably the aforementioned ""Rain"", as well as ""The last leaf"", ""shy girl"" and the very pretty ""little betty falling star"".Well worth your time."
3,Cascades is still great,My Mom plays this musicas far as I can remember.There music is so good that the whole family listen to them even though we were born around 70's but to us there one of the best.
4,Mine is fine...,"As another reviewer said earlier, sometimes the QA from Sigma is hit or miss. I have had the same experience in the past. The last 2 Sigmas I have tried have been fine (14 and 150 macro) My copy of this lens for Nikon is pretty nice (sharp, decent contrast if you keep light off the front element, fast accurate focus) on digital bodies. The HSM on mine is just as quiet as any of the AF-S Nikon lenses I have. I still prefer Nikon in general, but for the limited use I have for this lens, it has worked nicely."
5,"Little heavy, but good lens.","Just got this lens as a Christams gift, and I'm really impressed with it. It's a little soft at the edges wide open, but if you stop it down a bit, you get most of the corner sharpness back. It's also a little heavier than I'm used to, and I was suprized by how large it is. Nonetheless, it's a great lens for the landscapes I like shooting."
4,Perfect lens for time-lapse photography,"I am using 2 Sigma 14mm lenses for time-lapse photography in our earthquake test lab. They provide a view of the entire lab without fisheye distortion. The quality of the images, using Canon 450D cameras is good.I had problems finding 2 of these lenses to purchase, ending up buying the second several months after the first."
2,Sub-par,"OK so i bought this thinking it would get me into the game. But, the first problem i ran into was the software. The manual described different software than what came with it. Then, i fired up BF1942. NOTHING HAPPENED. No force feedback or anything. Not only was there no force feedback, but the resistance is SOOO INCREDIBLY WEAK that it is impossible to fly planes or helicopters. And, as said before, it doesnt go all the way back to the middle when you let go. So, I returned it.I do not recommend that you get this joystick"
4,decent stick,"I had the rumble version of this stick for a few weeks, liked it and decided to upgrade to this force feedback stick. It works well, but seems to have a difficult time autocentering. This makes it difficult for use with flight sims and such.If you follow the directions, you should have no problems installing the drivers. But, as others have said, don't expect to call an 800 number and get help."
4,Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Puppet Storybook,Very nice story for bedtime reading to my kids. Would buy again from seller. A+++
5,House mix : deep & hypnotic,"The fourth volume of the famous party ""Scream"" which were in Paris, mixed by DJ Freddy with one mix house always also hypnotic and powerful. It is the strong tendency of the house in France. Deep house with many african drums, which could be waked up any clubbers... Awesome...(listen it at amazon.fr)"
5,Beautiful Collection/ Soulful Rendition by Nancy Allen,"If you have heard Nancy's recording A Celebration of the Harp and liked her work, you will not be disappointed with this CD.If you have not heard ""A Celebration for Harp"".... buy both CDs. You will not be disappointed. If you enjoy harp , both albums are absolutely thrilling and divine. If you dont like harp? Well, listen to the music in the other place.Nancy... if you happen to read this... it is time for another CD!"
3,NOT A BOOK,"NAS printed on waterproof paper, but NOT BOUND into a book. A bit cumbersome in my opinion. I can't just unfold a huge map in church."
4,The Watson's go to Birmingham,"I thought that this book was awesome! It was a great example of what racism was like during the segregation in the US. The main story is about a little boy named Kenny and how he goes to Burmingham with his family. Mainly he learns that life isn't a perfect picture (that you usually here about in fairy tales, with happy endings) with two kids and one car. But instead that life is like a bumpy road full of obstacles. I would recommend this book to kids who like true stories, that are exagerated a little. This book is probably for teenagers and up."
3,Benjamin Stephens the review of 2001,I think this book was funny sad and weard it kinda tells you about every day life because big brothers like Byron picking on his little brother Kenny and Joey the one who complanes about things the mom who has a gap in her teeth who gets a southern acsent when she gets mad the dad who always wants to be funny by sounding like others trying to cheer up the family at times.
4,The O.K. Times with the Watson's,"Hi I am 12 years old, and I am from Leland, NC. I would reccomend this book to people, because it's funny and I liked it very much. My favorite part in the book was when Byron kissed his reflectin in the mirror and got his lips stuck. I also like the part when Byron was in the bathroom playing with matches, and his Mama tried to burns his fingers, but she couldn't, because his sister Joetta kept blowing out the matches. I also liked near the end when no one new where Kenny was hiding at, and the one night Byron peeked behind the coach and found out where his hiding place was. If I were you, I would buy the book. That's how good I think that book is..."
5,the watson go to birmingham 1963,I would reccomend this book the Watson go to Birmingham to many one who would want to read because this book is adout this boy and his family and them takeing a trip this boy named Byron and he is so bad that he has to go to stay with his grandmorther Sands and when they are there the boys sister goes to sunday school and they find out that the noise they herad was a bom that hit the little grils church and thought that she had got hurt and I also thought that it was an good book.
5,My Review,My name is... The book was helpful for me to understand what 1963 was like with the killings and the racial prejudgedicim. But alll in all it was a good and funny book.
3,The Watsons - A Review,"I really enjoyed reading The Watsons..... after I got into it. The everyday life of the family and the events they experienced in Alabama really gives readers a good inside look about a small portion of African American life in general. The author also did a great job showing different ways people react to tragedy. The only obstacle I had with this book is that it was hard to get into at first, it moved a little slow."
2,Not on my favorites list,"This definetly was not one of my favorite books.First of all, it doesn't get into the real plot until more than 1/2 way through the book; the other parts are just events strung together into chapters. Sure MOST of it leads up to the main point of the story, but do you realize this? I sure didn't.The author's style of writing makes this book hard to follow. I can tell that he tried to write from a 10-year-old's point of view, but obviously he tried a lil too hard, because it sounds like from the point of view fom a very immature ten year old.The description of the setting and characters in this book made it very difficult for me to write a book report for; and I just overall didn't like it, although most of the people I know (from my brother to my best friends) were exclaiming, ""Oh, you're reading that? Isn't it the best?""I usually finish a book this length in 1 1/2 to 2 days. But this one took me more than a week, I think, to finish because I was like, groan, do I have to?"
5,Awesome,A very good book to help younger children understand how different life was in the older days and how far we have come nowadays
2,O.K book bad title,"The beginning of the book was all about the funny antics of the family and the last 3 chapters were really confusing, but I give it an extra star becuase it was funny and it was against predjudice."
2,The not so good book,I did not like the book. It was not exciting. there was not that much adventure. The book was a little gory. they said a lot of bad words.
1,BORING!,This book was quite disappointing. They're 100 pages basically just introducing the perfect stereo type family and in two pages with a brief description the church is bombed. Then in two more days it's back to normal. The author used the same metaphors over and over again and it got very tiresome and annoying. The book was very predictable. A long story for a short plot. I don't reccomend you reading it for it's a waste of time and it certainly does not help you better understand history seeing they only spent two pages on it in the 200 page book.
1,What a shame!!!,"I was so disappointed in this book, I could cry. Being a fifth grade teacher who loves Historical Fiction to add to the flavor of the Social Studies classroom, I was looking forward to using this book. To me, the value of the book being a representation of an African American family in the 1960's was ruined by unnecessarily crude language."
1,The Flame Thrower,"I dont like the Watsons because they are mean.Byron is mean to Kenny and Buphead, they are so dumb, they are so mean to their parents.They need to go to Albama to see Grandma Sam, so they can srattin up,be good so they don't get in any more trouble, stop being mean to Kenny,and because Byron is trying to burn up the house."
3,The family named watsons,I like the Watsons go to Birmingham because when byron got in trouble joetta always helped him.I remember when Byron was playing with matches .Joetta was so sad that she start to cry.
3,The Watson's,"I thought the book was okay,but it was sort of dumb. Like when Joetta got the white angel from Mrs.Davis and was mad about.Other than that the book was funny,and had mnay changes.One of the changes was when Byron gets to Alabama and starts acting all funny and says things like yes ma'am & no ma'am."
4,From the ashes of Birmingham,"The Watsons go to Birmingham - 1963 is a good book because it tells you what they had to live through and what they had as a family in 1963. Some of the things they went through whas the bombing, and deaths of the youths at the Baptist Church. Kenny the main character of this book thought his little sister Joey was dead because she was at that church. Later in the story it explains that Joey wasn't dead, she saw Kenny and followed him out of the church. While Kenny was in his room at his grandmother Sands house, Joey walked in and Kenny was amazed. But the parents of some girls that died in this racialy motivated plot were very sad."
2,cool,I like it when byron always gets caught playing with matches and gets in trouble because it reminds me of my nepue because he used to do the same thing.I didn't like this book because there was to much cussing.every time i see a woman with a gap I think of mrs.watson and I think to myself that they need to close their mouth before they get a mouth full of bugs. i think this book wasn't as good as tom saywer
3,"Kaung, O","The main characters are Momma, Dad, Byron, and Joey Watson. The are going to Birmingham, Alabama, because to teach Byron a lesson about getting into trouble by making Byron stay at his Grandma Sands in Birmingham. While in Birmingham, they faced segreation and learn that family can solve any trouble."
3,the watsons go to birmingham,I like this book beacuse I thought the part when Byron got his lips stuck to the car window.And the part that really scared me was when joey was in the church and it blew up and when Kenny got stuck in the wool pooh. I also though when Byron got a conk that he had to shave it all off thats why i like this book.
5,The Lipless Wonder,I enjoyed the first chapter of the book because it was very entertaning. It started off talking about how cold it is in Flint. Then it went on talking about how they could have been Hambone Hendersons. Later in this chapter was the most hilarious part when By got his name The Lipless Wonder. I thought it was odd that he was kissing the mirror. If I was asked if I would recommend this book I would have to say yes. It is a very entertaning book and you should read it.
2,Alright,It was ok it did have some funny parts like kenny and by fighting. But it moved arounde alot like it did not stay one thing. But to me was not as good as Tom Sawyer. Because it was not as action pack and Tom was more like me that this book.
4,Hatred Attacks in 1963,"In this book, I liked how at the end Bryron came together with his brother Kenny and talking to him and making him feel safe. Although they had alot of conflicts between each other, he finially realized that the love he had for his brother. When I read that Joetta was in the building that was was bombed, my heart went out to her because she was so sweet. The thing that amazes me is when a look alike of Kenny led Joey away from the dasaster. Who was that gifted person, who was chossen to save an innocent life? Over all the book was really GREAT!"
5,The Weird Watsons,"It is SO cold in Flint and all the weird Watsons are huddleded up on the couch in the living room trying to stay warm. The family consists of momma who ws born in Birmingham, Dad who was bron in Flint, Byron who is 13 and thinks he's all that, Kenny who is 10 and has a nickname of Poindexter, and Joetta who is called Joey and is 4 years old. The family decides to take a trip to Birmingham to try and fix Byron's teenage juevenile deliquent problem with using matches and cutting school. Once they reach Birmingham, a tragedy happens that became a major place in time and history."
3,A funny story about a family during a dark part of history!,The Watsons' Go To Birmingham is a coming of age story for a young African-American boy during one of the most crucial periods in our country's history. This book focuses on every day life in a humorous fashion. We were disillusioned because we expected the entire book to be about the Civil Rights Movement. The focal point of the book was not the Civil Rights Movement but the Watsons' family.
1,NOT FOR INTELLECTS,"I wish there was a 0 star rating. Oh well. This was thesupidest, most boring book I have ever read. THIS BOOK IS DEFINITLYNOT FOR INTELLECTS!!!!!!!!!! I had to read it for a report. Now I have to make a summary on it and I can't do it because this anti-intelligent book was about nothing! I recomend this book ONLY to the boring and stupid people in this world. I am twelve years old and I go to a private school for smart people). C-YA. -Caryn"
5,Awesome Book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book was very good! The author wrote about Mystery, Civil Rights, and Sadness. He did a very good job. He is awesome. I recomend this book to everyone of all ages."
2,Can't see what everyone is talking about,"I have had a difficult time finding very many of the episodes funny unless you had grown up in the 1960s. If you were born in the 80s-90s I think most of the humor would be lost, because it needs the cultural/historical background to be understood. I found the book zenophobic (negative remarks about Chinese and people from the south) and it also seemed to glorify bullying. I think there are far better books out there that deal with the issue of racism than ones that include such negative subtexts.I have read a lot of juvenile fiction and this is one of the slowest paced books I have ever read. I think the only things that young readers might be interested in would be the bullying scenes. It takes a long time for the novel to move into the interesting plot line and there are several unexplained gaps in the end that leave the reader confused. I had to read this book as part of my job, but I really wanted it to end. Sorry, just being honest."
2,Highly over-rated,"Why this book is a Newberry Honor Book escapes me. It deals in offensive stereotypes, including language, life-style, and characterization. What characterization there is tends towards surface analysis only with little depth. The only redemptive feature is the epilogue."
4,The Watsons Go to Birmingham-1963,"The Watson's go to Birmingham-1963 is a book about a black family in 1963. Their oldest son Byron,is a trouble maker, so the family goes to Birmingham Alabama to have Grandma Sands teach him a leason. When they are in Birmingham Joey, the little girl, goes to Sunday school. She leaves shortly since she got too hot! After she left two white men drive by and throw a bomb at the church and it blows up! But Kenny the narrator of the story believes he saw the Wool Pooh in the ruins of the church (Winnie the Pooh's evil twin brother) This book is full of humor and adventures, so I recomend this book to anyone with a good sense of humor."
5,The Watsons Go to Birmingham 1963,"This book is about a family of five in the year 1963. They live in Flint,Michigan.Everybody called them the Wierd Watsons.In thier family they have a Momma-loving caring mother.A Dad-a funny, caring dad. Three kids the oldest Byron -juvenile delinquent. The middle child Kenny-A boy whose life is falling to pieces. The youngest Joetta or Joey-cry baby little sister who is always trying to save Byron.This story is based on how black people where treated in 1963. The Watsons decide to go to Birmingam, Alabama. While they were down there, something horrible happens.This is a very exciting. I hope you love it as much as me."
4,What A Trip for Byron,This book was great! I loved every minute of it. Our entire class read it and we all enjoyed it very much. My favorite part was when Byron got a conk. At first I thought that Dad was going to whip him or ground him. Instead he shaved his head!!! LOL! :>D!! Byron was told that he was going to stay with Grandma Sands this summer. Byron is my favorite character of the book because of his multiple personalities.
4,Savannah's Review of the Watsons go to Birmingham 1963,The Watsons go to Bermingham because Byron the oldest son is acting up. Thier father wants to drive all the way there without stoping. Thier mother said that it messed up all of her plans now that he has done that. When they get down there Kenny and Joey finally meet thier grandmother. Then thier grandmoth told them not to go into a a private place in the lake. Kenny doesn't listen and goes anyway. Kenny is starting to drowned. Then Joey goes to church and then she turned around because she said that Kenny was waving at her. So she turned around. Kenny saved her life that day because the church was bomed that day. So Byron went back up to Flint with them insted of staying with hisd grandmother.
4,The Watsons go to Birmingham- 1963 was a pretty good book.,"It mixes subjects well, it includes reading and language arts, history, and social studies. I recommend this book. It includes fiction and nonfiction information including the 1963 Sixteenth Street Baptist Church bombing. It also includes some humor. Kenny, the main character, has a troublemaking brother. They go to visit their grandmother and trouble awaits them."
4,Great book,"I think The Watsons Go To Birmingham- 1963 was a good book. It's a hilarious story about a family that goes to Birmingham, Alabama to visit grandma Sands, and finds a surprise and leave early. I recommend this book for older kids."
4,"a nice, short read.","This book was an excellent portrayal of the average black family in the '60's. The characters were realistic and seemed like everyday people I could relate to. The plot in the novel was easy to follow, and with a childs point of view, it was even more interesting. For a first novel, Curtis has major potential as a writer in the future."
5,The Watsons go to Birmingham-1963,"What I really liked about this book was that the pace of the book was breathtaking. You never knew what would happen next (unless you already read it). A part that really surprised me was the part where there was a bombing in Joetta's church. I really thought that Joetta really had died.The way that it was written really convinced me that it really happened. Especially when Kenny found that shoe.On a scale from one to five I would rate it a five.One reason I would rate it a five is because it was humorous yet some parts were serious. I like a book that is not to serious. I also like an author who has a sense of humor. That is a characteristic that that Christopher Paul Curtis seems to have. I really enjoyed reading this book.I look foward to reading more of his books soon.I plan on reading Bud,not Buddy. Judging from this book I think Bud, not Buddy will also be a hit.by Kimberly Ellis"
5,Reveiw of the weird watsons,"I think this was a inetersting,and a intellagent book for kids to read.this is the frist book I ever read an actually understand it.I think this book deserves all five stars.and the reason why I said I think the book should get all stars is becaise it feels like the you things you do or use to do.expcually the part when byron was trying to kiss his reflection in the mirrior and got his lips stuck that seems like somethin I'll do cauise I 'm always in the mirrior.I love the mirrior I even got a name for the mirrior an it's name is beautiful cause since i'm beautiful the mirroir should be called beautiful.anyway I think this is a really great book an whoever's reading this that I wrote should go out now an buy the book."
3,The Watsons Go to Birmingham -1963,This is an okay book. I reccomend it to people that like history. It has a little adventure. My favoret part is when they get the record player. The grosest part is when Byrun gets his lips stuck to the Brown Bomer.
3,"OK, I missed something","I will first say that I read the author's book ""Bud, Not Buddy"" before this and loved it, which is why I went and got this book. The book was OK overall and I would've given it 3.5 stars if I were able to. But I missed something somewhere. The bombing took place in September 1963, as is noted in the book. However, the Watsons drive down to leave Byron there for the summer, or perhaps the following school year as well. Wouldn't that imply they went in June or July? By September 15, they would've had to be back home for Kenny and Joey to be in school, even if the whole family had stayed down South for the summer. What am I missing?"
2,A College Student Review,"I read this book for a children's literature class and was not particularly impressed with it. I do not feel that the author ties everything in the book together. The book should end much earlier than it does. Also, I did not particularly like any of the characters. Some parts of it were funny but not that many and a lot of the parts that I think were meant to be funny actually made me cringe. I would not use this book in my classroom."
4,QND YOU WONDER WHY WE GE CALLED THE WEIRD WATONS,"i thought the book was good it gives so much information about the book.kenny is a good kid and joey to but byron is bad ,rued,disrespectful.wilona is going threw alot with her son byron but dosent have any problems with the others.i want to no why byron act so dumb."
3,The Watsons go to Burmingham 1963 by Mariah,"The Watsons go to Birmingham 1936 is a great book. See there are 5 main characters Momma, Dad, Joey, Kenny, and Byron. At the begining of the book, By is a trouble maker but as the book goes on he gets worse. At first he gets his tongue stuck to the car mirror. But one thing is weird about Byron some times he is nice to Kenny some times he isn't. I think By has mood swings. Kenny on the other hand is a nice kid who if he is in trouble his big brother Byron will help him. Joey is their little sis. She is not bad but just a tattle tale. One day mom and dad got tired of By being bad they wanted to send him to Birmingham, but they change there mind. So this book is full of action that is why I like it."
4,You gotta read the Watsons go to Birmingham-1963!,"Hi, I'm Sonereka Pernell. I just got done reading, ""The Watsons go to Birmingham-1963.This book is about a weird, gooffy and peculiar family who has a son as a juvenille delinquent. And so they sent him to live with his Grandma Sands. And then he starts being good and the good kid Kenny their good son starts to act naughty. It's like they're switching bodys or something.I really like this book because it's funny, educational, sad and exciting. And I also like it vecause your learning and having fun at the same time. I like the part when Joetta drewls in her sleep on Kenny in the care on the way to Birmingham, Alabama.The theme of this book is, you might have crummy family members, but they could really come through for you. I learned that family sticks together through thick and thin, even if they fight.This book was awesome threw the whole thing. I mean come on it couldn't get better than, ""The Watsons go to Birmingham-1963."""
4,Nice book,Loved the book it was good. It had a few sad moments in all the chapters. It was very good
2,Not good,"The beginning is pretty good and that's why I gave this a two star, but in the end Kenny gets all depressed and it just ruins the bookSambeast 100"
3,Definitely middle school,"It has been a long time since I have read a middle school novel. I kept thinking ""You'll shoot your eye out, kid"" from A Christmas Story movie. Both are along the same lines since both the classic movie and this book look at life from a totally random perspective of a young boy.This is a light-hearted look at the ugliness of segregation, although it does so only at the end of the story. The beginning is disjointed and seemingly disorganized. It takes forever for the story to come together and make a point.However, if it gets middle school students to read and actually learn something about our country's history, then it has done the job the author wanted."
4,Life in the eyes of Kenny Watson,"This book is a wonderful way to discover the feelings of blacks during the civil rights movement and the changing laws of segregation. Kenny, the main character, gives us details as to the difference between the way blacks were treated in Flint, Michigan, and Birmingham, Alabama. This book really got to me. It made me think of how we could treat each other so differently, even though we are all so alike. This is a magnificant book."
4,Brea's review,I think that you can loose yourself in this book very easily. Many nights I found myself loosing track of time while ready it. The best thing about this book is that you can relate to it so easily. there is always one character that you can relate to. I love how the auther describes the characters. he makes it easy for anyone to imagin what is happening in the book. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to get lost in a good novel.
5,The watsons go to birmingham,THe Book is good they told alot of ideas a goodpart to the book.That was when the movienment wascoming for the blacks.That was when we were startingthe civil rights movement for the black.This is a good book and movie.
5,Home sweet Alabama,I like the book because byron is starting to get nice with his grandma. and when he used to be in Michigan he used to be mean to his brother and did'nt obay his parents that why his mom and dad took him to Alabama and when they got there he was starting to get really nice with Kenny and Kenny told him what was wrong with him he was to nice with everybody. and when
4,Going to Birmingham with the Wacky Watsons,"The ""Weird Watsons"" pack up the ""brown bomber"" and head to Birmingham to see Grandma Sands, so that their juvenile delinquent son, Byron, can have an attitude adjustment. Watch for some comical and entertaining moments along the way.While in Birmingham, some frightening situations occur. Will the Watsons come back alive?The story, told from Kenny's imaginative point of view, is often filled with exciting, larger-than-life moments. Byron's exaggerated stories are full of dramatic images, which he uses to gain control over the situation. Be aware of a small amount of language that might not be appropriate for younger children."
4,read it yourself its a pretty good book,"the book was good but just not my type of book. my favorite chapter was ""the lipless wonder"" it was realy funny you just have to read it for yourself."
3,My Review,This book was very informational and i enjoyed reading it It is kind of like segregation and the information was a plantiar
4,Jon's Review,"While it's not difficult to imagine a novel for young readers that does a better job of dealing with sensitive issues than The Watsons, it would certainly be difficult to write or find such a novel.The novel's primary strength lies in the Watsons themselves, an instantly recognizable, universal, and likeable family whose interactions transcend any ethnic or class backgrounds by entertaining all. By the time Curtis turns his attention to explicit matters of race, one has been won over by the charismatic family, and is more than ready to follow them on any journey, no matter how unpleasant it may turn out.If Curtis' downplays the Birmingham bombing, and he does, it is certainly an understandable, if perhaps regrettable, decision. And, if his ending seems far too clear-cut, predictable, and ideal, it is far less so than most books for young readers, and the quality of the rest of the book renders this a forgivable flaw."
5,I give this book 2 thumbs up way up!!!!!!!!,"This book is about an African American family called the Watsons,during the 1960's.I think they had one of the hardest times to live in because during the 60's was when the Civil Rights movement was going on.Curtis shows us the differences in the North and the South at that time, and to be in Birmingham, AL at the time would have been scary for all African-Americans, for sure. His book is easy to follow and to understand and is both sad and funny."
4,Watson's Go To Birmingham-1963,"This book was pretty good. I think anyone who reads this would probably enjoy this book. Some parts are quite funny. Over all, I'd reccomend this bok to anyone older than 13."
3,My thoughts over the Watsons Go to Burmingham,"Hello, I just got done reading a book for a class project. My book was the Watsons go to Burmingham 1963. The book didnt really make much sense to me. The chapters were all differant and that made it confusing. In some parts of the book it is really funny, and in some parts of the book i was like ""why did they include that?"" Some parts you learn things and some parts taught you the opposite of what you learned in class. It talks about a fmaily going to Burmingham, Alabama. This book takes place when the Civil Rights Movement was going through. It also talks about life in 1963 for a black family. This book would be great for people who like stories told by a chracter. It would also be great for someone who likes to learn things about history, since the book took place in 1963. If you read this book i hope you like it!"
5,Holly-Watsons go to Birmingham-1963,My review was that this book show something to think about because no matter what you do to make some feel bad they are going to just ignor you about what you say about them. I would recomend it to the young people that love to have some laugh's and yet to learn about the 60's and what happen. My favorite part of the book is when By got his lips got stuck on the mirro of the car and when he got his head shave. Sometimes I think that it's the only book that I would Highly recomand to all age's.
5,Great Book,Absolutely fabulous! the book is incredible and the whole story is wonderful story line is amazing i felt as i where in the story.
5,Are you stuck to a mirror!,"Are you stuck to a mirror,isnt that a great title.The reason why I used that title is because it shows that it was my favorite part of the book.Byron's lips got stuck to the mirror and his mother pulled him off.I thought that part was hilarious,but about the whole book I liked it because it had alot of laughs in it and it showed us how much we use to be prejudice."
3,The Wastsons go to Birmingham-1963,"The Watsons go to Birmingham is an ok book. It is about a kid named Kenny part of his life story about his dad,mom,juvinile delinquint older brother Byron his nicknamed By , and little sister Joetta sometimes callled Joey .They take a trip to Birmingham,Alabama to strayian up Byron because he gets in so much trouble and that's what kept me reading this book or else I would have just put the book down.Byron gets in so much trouble that you do not want to put the book down because you want to know what trouble he gets into next. Half the book is about Byron geting in trouble with his friend Buphead in there home town Flint,Ohio. The moral of the story is that everyone is equal no matter what color they are. Theplot of the story is intresting story""sof kennys life."
4,Parents should read first,"I purchased the book as part of the collection for my classroom. The book is well written and is very emotional as well. After reading the book, I have decided that it will become part of my personal collection rather than the classroom collection. This is not to say that I don't believe students should not read the book, only that a parent should read the book first and determine if the child is emotianally ready to read the book and understand what was going on."
5,WONDERFUL BOOK,This book is a must read for people of all ages. The relationships and insight of an African-American family during the 1960's is exceptional. I highly recommend it for grades 3rd-8th.
4,Great for Kids and even adults!,"Birmingham, Alabama in 1963 was still troubled by the violence and was in the heart of the civil rights movement. The author has dedicated this book to four African American girls who died in the Church bombing in Birmingham of that year. The author in his first novel which is an impressive achievement writes about life in Flint, Michigan and growing up there in the wintertime in 1963. His mother would rather raise the family in the warm south, particularly her home state of Alabama. The book is really written for young adults but any adult can read this book and appreciate the realistic dialogue and situations of the Watsons, an African American family, in the midst of the Civil Rights movement."
3,The Watsons,The Watsons go to Birmingham is a book that teaches young readers what the life style was like during that periond of time. You would never think that a mother like Mrs. Watson would follow through on a punishment so harsh that she can scare her child just to prove a point.
3,Bryn's Review of this book...,"We just finished reading this book, and I had very mixed feelings about it. I enjoyed the reality that Kenny created for himself and it was interesting to watch him discover and learn things for the first time. I can appreciate this book for the accurate portryal of a normal family, black or white, in the 1960's. Although I enjoyed it, I cannot say that it in any way deeply affected me or that I felt at all changed after reading this book. But perhaps that is what makes it so enjoyable for all ages."
2,redundant,"I greatly disliked this book (even though my younger sister loved it) because I felt it was very redundant to many books of the same topic. The dialect, tone, and general plot of the narrative seemed very stereotypical of the average story about a black family during this time period in America. I was looking for something new and innovative from a new author's first attempt, and was disappointed to read something I had already read many times before."
2,not recomended,well... its not the worse ive ever read but its right up there... we had to read it for lit. and im not happy about it
5,The Best Book Ever!!,"This book is full of drama, comedy, and so much catstrophe. The part with the most comedy is when Rufus and his brother(new kids) both get on the bus and talk funny. The part that I think has the most catstrophe is when Byron dyes his hair and his dad shaves all of his hair off. If you are looking for a really good book full of entertainment, this is the exact book for you!"
4,It's a good book to pick up!,"I thought this book was awesome, it mixes reality with humor at the same time. I thought that this book kept me interested and curious. The characters seem like realistic people that made you feel like you were a part of the story. It also revealed the harshness that people had to bare during that time. It moved me emotionally and it made me laugh at the same time which is what a good book is supposed to do. I Feel this book is awesome and everyone should read it! Have fun!"
3,Watsons go to Birmingham - 1963: A Novel by Christopher Paul,"The Watsons go to Birmingham is a good book about a black family in 1963 that faces many conflicts at home and on there trip to Birmingham. The main characters are Kenny and Byron Watson,they face many conflicts in the book. Kenny is a 10 year old boy who is very intellegent for his age and gets bullied alot at school. Byron is a 13 year old who is nothing at all like his little brother Kenny he is a bullie and picks on Kenny alot. The two boys biggest conflict is racism."
3,5th,"The Watsons Go to Birmingham-1963 is a rather interesting book. The author used great descriptions on what the characters are like and what they go through. On the other hand I also thought that the book was quite drawn out and intensely boring. Also, some parts i didnt understand with the dialect. In conclusion, I give The Watsons Go To Birmingham-1963 3 stars."
4,5th,"The Watsons go to Birmingham was a great book. I thought that the most interesting part of the book was when the bomb was thrown into the church and they did not knoe what it was. When they found out it was the church they ran all they way down there and were very sad. When they got there they were to scared to go in to try to find Joetta. I thought this was an interesting part, because they were trying to get there as fast as they could to try to find out about Joetta, but when they did not know what to do. I thought this book had good potential and should be taught in a group to classes. If I had a choice I would choose this book because it is on of the most hilarious and entertaining books I have ever read. I usually do not like to read a lot but this book had me were I wanted to read and when I got started I could not stop, just simply put this is a great book."
5,hottie's review of the watsons,I think this book is good for a child.The author that wrote this book is a good author because he did it in a childs eye. The part I like is the part when Byron got his lips stuck to the mirror and was cryimg like a baby.I can't see how they live in cold Flint.Another part I likie was when he was about to nget his finger burnt and Joey keep blowing out the match.She was spiting on her mothers hand and byron didn't get his hand burnt. This book is are right but there was some cusing but that was all right.i give this book five stars because it's good.Bye
4,The watsons go to bermingham Review,The watsons go to burmingham in 1963 is like taking a field trip.But not just any regular field trip.But a field trip back in time to 1963 where people were still raichelin parts of south America.The most funniest parts to me was when byren kept playing with matches and his mom said that the only way to make him stop playing with matches was toburn his figers of and joey kept on blowing and slobbering all over it.And my secound favorate part is when byron got his toung stuk to the car side mirror and my last favorate part of the book was when they where on there way to the country and they stoped at a rest stop and they had to use the out house and thats it.Have A
4,The Watson's Go To Birmingham,"I think this book is funny, kinda sad, kinda bad,(actually all of the above). I think one of the best parts of the book is when Byron gets all of his hair shaved(cut)off,then his head was looking like the sun. A sad part of the book was when them three or two little girls died and the were all crying and screaming trying to find Joetta and them thinking that Joetta was on of them little girls who died from the bomb that two men had dropped on the church. The bad parts were with all the foul language they had in it (although it wasn't entirely all that bad). I personally think that you should create a movie based on the book. Hopefully this interview will change his or your mind!"
5,Miss Ronning's 5th grade class,I think that the Watsons go to Birmingham 1963 is a good book so I gave it 5 stars. I gave this book 5 stars because the kids are really funny. I liked it because it was a really good book.The book is about a family that is going to Birmingham and they and they have to stay at grandma Sands house for a little while.Yes I would recommend it for someone because it is a good kids book and if you like funny books it will be a good book for you.by: Kaylee
4,Pretty Good!,"This is a very warm, youthful portrayal of an African American family and their experiences in Flint, Michiga and Birmingham, Alamaba. The book is jovial and centering on the theme of youthfulness, it also has some corny humor. It indirectly touches on racisim. This may be a good book to introduce young children to some of the social and moral issues pertaining to racism. Getting involved in the story naturally leads one to thoughts on racism, though rather indirectly."
4,The Weird Watsons and their Amazing Trip,"Riding in the car for over 3 days! This is something the Weird Watsons did. The Watsons go to Birmingham-1963 was written by Christopher Paul Curtis. It won several medals. These medals are the Newberry Honor, the ALA Best Book for young adults, the Coretta Scott King Honor, and the ALA Notable Book. The Watsons consist of Byron, Kenny, Joetta, Momma, and Dad. Byron is a school bully who hurts kids who tease Kenny. The book teaches you about a sad moment in Birmingham's History. This book also made me laugh out of my socks. A funny part is when Byron does something with his hair and it gets cut off. This book was also very serious about segregation and African American history. I rated this book four stars because it was very, very funny."
5,"Alabama, here we come!","The Watsons Go to Birmingham - 1963 is the story of a family who has a juvenile delinquent son, named Byron, and they are going to Birmingham, Alabama to see if their grandmother can straighten him out. Who will win the war between Grandma Sands and Byron? Look for emotional events that will draw the family closer together.This Newbery Honor Book is funny and sad at the same time, and it has scary moments, but it also has a satisfying climax. As you read, you can watch the characters grow and change. Often, the author's dialogue makes you feel as if you are in the room with the people, and you can't wait to see what kind of exaggerated story Byron is going to tell next, and if there is any truth to it. The book contains some scenes that are difficult for the reader to experience, but this also helps it to be a page turner until the very end. If you like funny, sad and exciting moments, read this book!"
3,sweetdish creme and welfar chesse,I think that this book was petty go. It just tells a good story about a good family that had some hard times back back in 1963. I like stories like this because it tells you information about those times when they were in the civil rights age of there time. I also liked this story because it was funny and it made you want to laugh.
4,kennys trip,my favorite characture is kenny because he is always making fun of people. he was always talking about people when they get in trouble like when byron gets in trouble for getting a conk. he was saying your fon the front of the row of death row. Or when he was talking about when all the people when the bomb went off. I liked this story because it is the only book that I have gotten in to.
3,The Empty Space Inside!!!,The end of this book was cut short. I felt empty inside after it was over. It was a good empty though the kind that makes you think. I though about the reason and meaning of things in a more indepth way.While funny and entertaining it also invoked thought. I liked the way the author wrote. His style was cut to the chase with just enough detail to keep you turning the Page. The author decribed things in a way that painted a picture in your mind.It starts off a tad slow and it seems pointles to keep reading it but by the end I thought it was well worth my time.Though not my favorite book I would recomend it to anyone with the time to sit back and enjoy a lazy afternoon full of reading or a rainy day stuck in the house.
2,Not so good...,"I was chosen to read this book at school and didn't like it. Byron tends to say foul language a lot. The reason I rated it two stars, not one is because the bombing chapter was interesting, but confusing."
4,The Whispering Statue,"Who stole the Whispering Statue and Mrs. Merriams books? Nancy Drew is on the case to figure that out. She goes to Waterford to gather clues but she fell into dangerous traps and gets in trouble with the criminal himself! Who knows what's going to happen next? This outstanding story takes you through a thrilling adventure, having you guess what's going to happen next. The ending just might be what you are not expecting. Great book!"
4,Worth Your Time,"In this book, the family experiences both sad and happy moments. The family is an African- American family in the 1960's living in Flint, Michigan. Each of the three Watson children experience significant events that happen in their lives. Because of their ""juvenille delinquent"" brother, Byron, they decide to make a trip to ""safe"" Birmingham, Alabama. While they are there, the family experiences the famous church bombing that killed four young girls. I recommend this book because of the various events that happened in an African-American family. Meredith Rains, 8th grader at Mason County Middle School"
4,"Overall, this book was pretty good.","This book gives the reader an opportunity to see life in the 1960's through the point of view of a ten year old African American. The family experiences hardships like a juvenille delinquent son who likes to play with fire. The family takes a long hypnotizing trip to Alabama to visit their grandmother as well as leave Byron there for the summer. However, their plans were interrupted when a Birmingham church was bombed. The book was pretty good even at it slow points. Jena Hendrickson, 8th grade, Mason County Middle School."
2,"A History Lesson, But Not for the Fainthearted","I have been reading this book aloud to fifth graders in a rural area, and I don't get it! I am very uncomfortable with the enthusiasm with which the book embraces violence as a staple of black family life. There is a chapter about a bully who does a ""Maytag wash,"" scrubbing his smaller victims with snow and then flinging them against a chain link fence - apparently meant to be funny, but my audience of ten-year-olds just looked puzzled. In another chapter, the mother approaches naughty brother Byron with matches, Vaseline and bandages, intent upon burning his fingers as punishment. Fortunately, sister Joetta blows out the matches - also meant to be funny, I guess, but it is difficult for me to see the humor in child abuse. I might concede that this book is a valuable illustration of a particular time in history, but the Birmingham experience is overshadowed by the portrayal of African Americans as stupid and scary . . . not the lesson I had hoped for."
5,The book was long and great.,The book was hard to put down.It was unbeliveble. It was the best book I have ever read.It made me feel happy than sad .
4,Be a part of the Wierd Watsons,"This is great book to read to children. I read this book for my Children's Literature class and I loved it. I felt like I was sitting in their house and was a part of their family. This book is full of humor and tragedy. Curtis captures the emotions of everyone in the family. I think anyone can relate to this book. I know I can because everytime my family went on vacation my dad would fix up the car before we would leave. Curtis does a nice job of tying in The Civil Rights Movement even though he does not come out and say it, an example would be when the Watson's thought Joey was at the church when the bomb went off. This book gives a good description of what is was like in during the Civil Rights Movement. This is a great book for young children to read."
4,The Watson's go to Birmingham,"I liked The Watsons go to Birmingham because it made you laugh in about every sentence! For example, when the Watson kids called their brown car ""the turd on wheels."" I think the author made the book like it was real. I think the book made you feel like you were in the setting because of all the details. I gave this book four stars because I didn't get the part about the Wool Pooh, Winnie the Pooh's evil twin brother. Besides that, it was great! My favorite character was Byron who thinks he's too cool for anybody. I would recommend this book to you because of all the humorous moments!"
4,The Watsons Go To Birmingham- 1963- A True Delight,"In 1963, Kenny Watson and his family from Flint, Michigan, decide to go to Birmingham for a family vacation. This book entails the journey, but more importantly, it is a perspective of the life of the Watsons. Even though they are black, they are the ideal American family of the 1960s. As seen though the eyes of a fourth-grade boy, Kenny, the book is funny, innocent, true to life, and often quite profound. Kenny's point of view makes this book a great one whether the reader is eight years old or 80 years old. There are many levels upon which this book can be enjoyed, and personally, it was a true delight to read."
4,"An easy, informative read","For me, this book was a break from having to go into definite deep thought. Although it is for all ages, the fourth grade reading level definitely makes it more enjoyable for a high school senior who constantly analyzes very difficult books. The way Curtis wrote made you not even realize that the family was even black until the end. I would recognize the fact that people of all ages, genders, races, and religions would enjoy this book."
3,"Still fine, though no way the best.","The best portrayals of Abigaille, assumed daughter of Nabucco, came from two great Greek sopranos, Maria Callas and Elena Souliotis.Callas recorded a live Nabucco in 1949 in Naples with Bechi, but the sound quality is outright horrific. Souliotis, however, did leave a wonderful recording with Tito Gobbi in the title role.The present one, under a young Riccardo Muti starring Manuguerra in title role could have fared much better had Ghiaurov and Scotto been in better voices at the time of recording. As it is, both sounded underpowered and at times pale.Manuguerra is perhaps the best performer in this recording.And the conducting of Muti is only somewhere in the middle road. The great chorus of the Hebrews did not own the wonderful sound that it should have. The score should have much more drama and force than that realised by Muti."
1,BAD DESIGN !!!,"I'm really dissapointed with the leather design. It looks like it fits the phone like a sock but it doesn't. First of all, the hole for the microphone does not line up. Second, the phone is so bulky until it opens itself with just a slight bump. The phone does not shut itself easily when you close it after talking. Third, the phone does not open fully with the leather case on....it feels weird talking through the case. The material used for the speakers feels really cheap. I don't know what to do with it now....sell it to someone cheap? Or I may have to just give them to some family member as a gift and let them figure this out. In conclusion, I wasted my $$ on this!!"
2,IT WON'T LAST!!!,"I purchased this case new with my phone and alternate it, using the holster sometimes and the case at other times. The case is somewhat durable, but not real tough. Recently the stitching started to come out and the plastic which covers the keypad of the phone broke at the bottom. I am not real rough on my stuff and am only a mild cell phone user so I found this item disappointing. By comparison, the Nokia cases hold up much better. If you have a StarTac, skip this case and try a 3rd party brand - you will sepnd less and probably will get a better case."
5,Fits like a glove,This is a great product for the Startac phone. The leather fits perfectly with a high-quality look. I wear it more frequently than the plastic belt-loop case that came with the phone. Only complaint is that the phone has a tendency to open while it is being worn.
3,Beware of the missing belt clip,I actually think this is a great case -- I have tried two others and this seems to be the best made. But Amazon[.com] shipped it without a belt clip despite the fact that both the catalog picture and description say that a belt clip is included. I ordered the correct package (Motorola 99653) from another web site.
4,broad overview of Native American star lore tales,"""They Dance In The Sky"" is divided into chapters that focus on particular regions of North America. Within each chapter are descriptions of the tribes in that region and then retellings of several of their star myths. At the end of each chapter the reader will find a listing of each tribe's constellations or important stars, and the Western equivalent, if known.This book doesn't go into detail about the significance of the myths or the specific stars that figured into the tales, but it does give a broad representation of the kinds of tales told by the various peoples. This makes it a lighter read, and for some that's just right.Don Childrey, author of ""STAR TRAILS: Navajo, A Different Way To Look At The Night Sky"""
5,Very detail and a good reading,"I agree this book doesn't go into detail about the significance of the myths or the specific stars that figured into the tales, but it does give a broad representation of the kinds of tales told by the various peoples. This makes it a lighter read and make also to any researcher a good initial guide for etnoastronomy."
1,Kindle edition of queen of spades,"The amazon blurb says this book in in Russian with accented text. Perhaps the paper text is, but the kindle one is in what I think is Ukrainian and is not accented."
1,Aweful.,"Pushkin's work is great. This edition is terrible. It is not the full story (short as the original story is) -- it is an adaptation, a shortened version, and most of the nuances are gone."
3,Getting Prepared,"I read this short story as preparation for the reading of Alice Randall's latest novel ""Pushkin and the Queen of Spades"". The main character of Pushkin's short story is Hermann, a man who at the onset of the story appears to be a level headed and prudent engineer. He is able to observe his friends gambling for hours without participating. ""I am very much interested in cards,"" Hermann says, ""but I am not in a position to sacrifice the essential in the hope of acquiring the superfluous"". After hearing a story of the Countess X and her secret to winning in cards, Hermann undertakes a ploy to romance the Countess's maiden in hopes of gaining access to the Countess and her secret. While I didn't find this story particularly moving or creative in a modern literary sense, I am excited to see how Randall will integrate Pushkin's original story with her latest novel."
4,Smooth!,"Very very nice. Song of the Wind is a great groove. I like the way the fiddle and dobro work to fill the organ and electric guitar solos on a number of tracks. ""Put Your Lights On"" is the only clunker. ""Smooth"" and ""She's Not There"" have all the energy of the originals."
1,This One Will Put You To Sleep!,"Yikes! Nothing evil about this yawner. Save your money and buy one of the other Pickin albums, like the Rolling Stones . This one was a real disappointment. Carlos Santana would have a mexican fit if he heard what they have done to his songs."
5,My Favorite Southern gospel group,"9/17/01I love this double cd, and could not ask for a better selection of songs, it is played over and over at my home. You too will enjoy this wonderful happy music. Thanks."
3,The Cathedrals Anthology,Disc 2 of The Cathedrals Anthology arrived in the disc one box. The music is fine but it is not what I expected to receive.
1,Nokia Leather Carrying Case for Nokia 5100 Series Phones,This case is very tight-fitting and awkward to use.
2,comes off belt,"I ""had"" a Nakia phone with this case, but I found out the hard way it will slip off your belt. I lost my phone while riding my motorcycle, never did find it. I plan on buying another Nokia phone but will look for a case that can't slip off so easily or will have to be sure I take it off before I ride. Also, I did have this phone and case slip off in the car also."
1,Too Tight,We had extreme difficuty trying to place the case on the phone. A portion of the cover ripped. Maybe mine was defective. I would suggest stretching the cover before placing.
3,"Good, but could be better","I saw these guys in Philly when the opened for Cato Salsa Experience who opened for The Soundtrack of Our Lives. Pretty good billing huh? Citizen Bird really impressed me as a live band with their neurotic lead singer and huge psychodellic sounds. I never wanted to buy a cd after seeing a show more than after this. When I got home I was a bit dissapointed. The sounds is a bit muffled and it seems to lack some of the crazy energy that I know the band can put out. However, I would definitly see the band again and would buy their next album."
4,keyboards up front,"lots of suicide and stranglers.traces of cult, radiohead, floyd circa '69and mercury rev circa 99'.solid songs, excellent playing...most interesting rock album i've heard this year"
2,Painful to Watch,"I didn't like this video at all. It gave more screentime to the white supremacists than anyone else. also, the video blatantly seemed to ignore the role of the Islamic religion in the culture of Somalis, and instead focused more on the churches helping them (nothing wrong with it, but I feel the islamic aspect should not have been so excluded)."
5,J.A. is right AND the CD is outstanding...,"Wow, what a bunch of *&%&*(#@^%^&% in Dork's review. If he isn't Shelby's producer, it sounds like he's angling to be.That said, this is a great CD. Very reminiscent of Bill Evan's most introspective work. Deep, deep harmonies and funky rhythms. Lovely stuff."
5,Excellent lounge room jazz,"I first heard this cd in Austin, TX on a late night jazz show. I was setting the alarm to go to bed, and I found that I could not stop listening to it. The smooth brushwork and spectacular piano kept me awake throughout the entire two song set the DJ was playing. I have not heard the entire thing, but if the rest of the songs are anything like the two I heard, then consider me an instant fan. I hope to find the cd and buy it soon."
5,Inspirational and Informative,"This book is a well written, accurate depiction of women in funeral service. It is a must read for anyone, women in particular, who are thinking about a career in funeral service. This book was the catalyst for my entry into the world of funeral directing."
3,"Don't leave your day job, Alexandra","I can see why Alexandra didn't make it in Journalism...this book is more of a month-by-month documentation of her life from abused child, to mortuary student, to model and back to mortician. The book drags in many parts, repeating already known facts. On the upside, Alexandra knows how determination can meet a career goal. I was impressed by her ""go and get 'em"" attitude. She has met some interesting people along the way that makes for an interesting life. It's not the best written book, but it is great bathroom material that left me with red toilet rings and tingling feet. Alexandra, you're a great gal !!"
2,Wish I had known...!!,"I purchased these electric scissors to help save my hands when I am cutting material or anything for that matter. When I read the discription I thought it read that they take 4 AAA batteries and even when I received this product it says the same thing. Well if it does I have yet to find a way to put any batteries in the thing! It also says that you can charge it up with the wall charger which is ""NOT"" included. Big help that is, but maybe it's just me and you'll love this product. IF YOU CAN GET IT TO WORK!"
2,Uninteresting,"I can't find one really catchy song here and the voices sound rather weak. They try to be a bit like TLC, but they fail."
4,Informative,I was very suprised by this DVD. It was very informative and filmed well. I only wish it were available in Spanish.
3,in good shape,I got this book quite fast. It was in good shape for as old as it was. Really good reading and it enjoy it alot.
5,Great reading!,I became thoroughly immersed in this book while on vacation and stayed behind to read while my family went to the beach. The author captured my heart while I read her account of the trials and tribulations her family experienced in 1940s Poland. I highly recommend it.
3,fairy tights,"tights look great in the package, but are ill fitting on a child----baggy and droopy---maybe lacking lycra or something."
4,Una obra de arte,"Es un libro muy profundo y muy bello. Hay que leerlo con tiempo y con ganas, pues lo importante no es tanto lo que sucede, sino las cosas que piensan y dicen los personajes. Me hizo reflexionar sobre muchos temas, como la soledad, la muerte, el patriotismo, la religion, etc."
4,Creative choices and tight syncopation.,"I know nothing of the Comedian Hamonists other than what's written in the album notes. They must have been quite an outfit. The King's Singers here are tight and well directed. The Flight of the Bumble Bee is a hoot. Night and Day never sounded so lovely and although I do not speak German, I found the German language numbers interesting to listen to."
3,Decent Shower Head for Decent Price,"I had a Delta shower head installed in my new home built in 2003. Due to hard water build up and regular use by multiple family members every day for the last 6 years, its gasket went bad. Gettting a replacement gasket by ordering from Delta would have been over $10 plus shipping costs. So I bought this new shower head instead.The head itself is fine, but the hose is made of plastic/PVC painted chrome metallic. From a distance it appears fine, but doesn't hang well and is prone to twist. The accompanying compression gasket and mounting coupler, which is made of very cheap plastic, are molded on to the plastic hose. They will go bad quickly due to use of hot water.The price is nice at $23 and matches the rest of my original Delta shower components, but its so cheaply made, it will go bad in 2-3 years from regular use. If you're getting this as a replacement in a primary shower, buy 2 units so it can last you 5-6 years."
3,it's ok,"the price was nice on this shower head. it looks good and works well however, I can't seem to find a comfortable setting. The light spray is very wide and the one with the right amount of pressure is too narrow. at first i told myself i would get used to it, but it has been over a month and it still bothers me sometimes. i have heard no complaints from my boyfriend who uses it often, or my sister and mom who have also used it a few times. i wish there was a way to sample them before buying. i'm not saying don't buy it. it is nice, i just wish i was happier with the settings."
4,Good charger. Ok batteries?,"I bought this charger and 4 batteries over 9 months ago. Used them frequently and successfully for 5 months in the portable breast pump that my wife used.Now I have a Pentax k100d digital camera. I thought these 2500mah would work better than the 1800mah duracell rechargeables I have but as soon as put into camera fully charged Ultra batteries, it let me take few pictures and the next day, the camera shows no juice left. I know this digital SLR demands high performance but these Ultra batteries are failing. After I take out these batteries from Pentax, I am able to use them for long in toys, flashlights etc.Now I have bought Energizer 2500mah, so I should be able to give a better evaluation of Ultra betteries in few days."
3,Pianist of the Century,"Ritcher was awesome right out of the box and his playing of this early recording is no exception. However, hardly is this disc one of my Richter favs like Rachmoninoff's 2nd on DG or Schubert's Wanderer Fantasie on Angel.Further, the disc should be re-released with a dvd of the dude who came down from the TB sanotorium on the Magic Mountain to cough relentlessly through the entire performance being executed by firing squad."
