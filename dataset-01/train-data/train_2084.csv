4,"A review from ""the other side""","I am not shopping for a DSL connection, I bought this book for a completely different reason. I work for a supplier of DSL equipment (both network side and CPE) and I recently had to argue for our solutions to an ILEC (not in the U.S./Canada) with whom we were trying to do business. What we in the business calls ""access networks"" were new to me, so in addition to a quick technical overview I needed to know how ILECs/CLECs/ISPs position themselves with their services; I needed to know how they planned to make their money. (Also we ex-techies need to become bean-counters of sorts...) DSL for Dummies actually provided that. It also gave me an explanation of the most common buzzwords and abbreviations so I could hold my own when talking to the real DSL nerds. I would have liked to see more what's going on on the other side of the DSLAM (the datanetwork to the ISP), that would have added the fifth star."
2,Techno Babble...Alot Wrong...Alot Right,"This is probably one of the most dry dummies books out there. The author has a lot of good information, however it has multiple errors throughout. Being that this book was presented in a dummies cover, I expected a bit of fun in it. It just wasn't. He covers a lot of stuff that I believe anyone who has DSL should know, doesn't really go to deep into a lot, which is okay, but you could probably find a better book out there. Being that this one was so dry, reads like a tech manual, get a tech manual. At least they are more accurate."
2,Annoying Hero,"Leigh is a young rich girl who is in love with her stepbrother Morgan. Problem is Morgan thinks she's a golddigger just like her mom. His mistrustful nature has him treating Leigh quite shabbily throughout this manga novel, which made me not like him. I would've preferred if the guy was more mellow. He is older and smarter than Leigh and thus really doesn't have an excuse to fly off the handle so much. The art was very nice, but Morgan's meaness didn't really work for me as it felt abusive.The artwork was well done though, and the characters were well portayed... But I prefer less arguing and more romance in my romantic manga."
1,Boring and Predictable,"I can't believe that this is written by Amanda Browning, the same author who wrote 'Seduced'. Where is the wit, humour and passion I found in the other story? This is the worst of formula stories. Where do you still get H/H forced into a marriage of convenience after being caught in a compromising situation? For Heaven's sake! This is a contemporary romance , not a Regency."
4,worth the money!!,Product arrive on time and was just as shown on web site. would buy from them again in a heart beat!!
1,why me,why did this happen to me i never got my item i have been waiting its passed the date it said it would be here
4,Paris as Centre of the Universe,"They are all in here - Picasso, Modigliani, Rousseau, Gertrude Stein, Duchamp, Man Ray with a sprinkling of Hemingway. The book is a series of short vignettes on the daily life in Montmartre and Montparnasse with the drugs, the poverty the sex...Sometimes I feel the author is too dismissive of the emotional toll on the lives of the women who were used/abused/discarded with regularity by these artists and some make-believe artists. And the vignettes become repetitive, but entertaining nonetheless.What is intriguing is that Paris was the centre for art, culture and experimentation from 1900 thru the 1930's, but was gradually replaced by New York (the occupation during the war accomplished the final transfer)."
2,Not very hot compared to others in the same price range.,It was disappointing. The reviews I read here said it was good with thick hair. It's mediocre on the ends but that's about it. I have hardly used it.
3,Meh,"This DVD was alright. The commentary is entertaining and humorous, but besides that, its just music videos, so I guess if you like that then buy this. The better GC DVD is coming out on October 5th, its a live DVD thats coming out on the same day as their new CD, that'll be worth buying. PS: All you teenyboppers, just... go away. please."
5,Yeah G.C.!!,"This DVD is amazing, that's all I can say. If you're a hardcore GC fan, this is a MUST HAVE! All their videos (except ""Hold On"") with commentary from the boys! Awesome... just awesome!! Luv GC!"
1,not punk,"this dvd is not punk there is nothing about it that is punk. if you like good charlotte that is fine, but if you go around calling them punk then i will be mad. they are not punk, and whoever calls them punk is wrong, since that act like they are punk. if you want to hear punk listen to the sex pistols and dead kennedys. i have nothing against good charlotte, just please understand that they are not punk"
1,I just can't insult them enough :),"Remember back when life was great, before Good Charlotte started their pathetic excuse for a ""band""???Mmm, yummy delicious irony :) :) :PGood Charlotte fans are like ants- you can easily crush them :) :) :PI await any hate mail from ""gC rEpReZenTaZ""...... :) :) :P"
5,THE BEST THING EVER,this dvd rocks it shows some of the oldest gc songs in the history of bands such as little things and festivial song and many other great songs it also includes some interviews in between songs but wait i should not be runing it 4 u you have to check it out for yourself LOVE YA GC
5,the video collection,"this video collection was th best. i love good chrlottes music video's. it also has snazy features like the band commentarty (except for chris) and and funny video short, plus a cd discography. it has little things, motivitation proclamation, festival song, lifestyles of the rich and famous, the anthem, boys and girls, and the young and the hopeless. its a realy funny and great dvd that you should buy. their such an awsome band and this collection is just as great. billy, joel, benji, and paul could not have done this any better! enjoy this kickn' music video collection! i know i did!!!"
5,Excellent phone! Works great with a Wireless Network,"I've had this phone for over 2 weeks and love it! It's very clear! I not a big fan of wireless phones, but this one is the exception! I love it! Very sytlish! I'm also very pleased that it doesn't cause any problems with my wireless network! The joy! Buy this phone fast!"
3,"Decent features, poor range",I think the other users of this phone have covered well enough the features of this phone. The main problem with the phone is its range. I feel that due to it's poor antenna on the handset your range is severely cut. I've found that I have to point my head in a certain direction for the break up of the signal to be lessened.Pros that I found:Voice message feature that hangs up after playing is nice.Buttons and screen are easy to use.Cons:Range is poor.Expandability seems to be limited to two handsets.Price is no longer competitive with other products out there.
1,"Great feature set, Poor Talk Quality and Range","The phone has received high marks from several sources, which is why I bought it. It has terrible range! It clips the voice into pieces which is very hard to understand. I have a brick house which I would consider of average to small size. I cannot go into my basement with it nor into my back yard. I only wish I had spent more time testing it within the 30 day return period. I will be replacing the phone soon. IF THERE is anything you get out of this review, it is to make sure you have the time to put ANY cordless phone through its paces during the store return period.Also something that is annoying is you cant make a call from another area code from the caller-id list without hitting the * key so that the phone will append a 1 in front of the phone number. I have called customer support and that is the way it is designed."
5,UK,"Being British and having watched this in Uk for over 20 years, of course I just love to watch these over here in US. You US folk may have a problem understanding the accent, but it certainly gives you insight into life in the suburbs, away from London."
2,Much smaller than I anticipated for a child sized hat.,This hat is very small. It would not fit my 4-year-old son's head. It did fit my 3-year-old's head but is very snug.
3,OK product,This product is OK. I helped during Halloween season. Just keep in mind that it won't fit a child older than 8 years old. It is really for little kids
1,ALL FAKE!! THIS GUY NEVER EVEN GOT INTO ANY RING.,"The whole book is fake. He was never a professional wrestler. He talks about the early 90's and 80's but he was kid. This book should be called living a lie. try to find any information about professional wrestling involving this guy (YOU CAN'T). THE OTHER GOOD REVIEWS ARE FAKE, LIKE THIS BOOK."
4,Nice but limited,Nice book as reference but limited otherwise.More applicable as a SAS detailed language introduction without touching statistical issues.
5,Excellent for beginners,This is the best book to learn SAS as a begineer. No need to have any prior knowledge in SAS. Read this book and you can work on SAS comfortably. This book will give you enough knowledge to learn more by practicing SAS practically.
5,Recommend book to all scientists with little SAS experience,"I'm a graduate student in the sciences looking to use SAS to ""crunch"" some of my data. Unfortunately, I've never taken a class in it. This book was recommended to me by the professor that teaches the SAS course at my college. It is extremely helpful and walks you through every step that you need to do to make your data work for you!"
1,Worthless!,"I am sorry to say that this has been a complete waste of money. I bought the book as part of the required reading list for a biostatistics class and have found it to be entirely inadequate. I would advise others to save their money and rather reference the multiple online manuals available. At least those cover all the functions, provide better examples, and are free! This one is going straight for the recycling bin..."
3,Local band when growing up,"Recording quality is obviously not up to today standards. There are some fine momments though, these guys were really good live."
1,Worst Spatula,Distorted in one day while cooking. Worst buy ever. Melts like an ice as soon as it gets near the burner. Two dollar Farberware spatula worked better. I have been using it for 4 years still look better and work better.
4,Slowly getting there,"Flash drives are the best form of data transportation. The problem is mainly the price for the higher capacities.A flash drive of similar capacity would have cost you $2000 less then 3 years ago.Yes, the Nano is 4GB flash as well. But one of the main reasons people buy flash drives over HD drives is the size.The Nano is slightly bigger then this drive, but don't forget you need to carry an additional cable with the Nano as well. And that makes all the difference."
2,Painfully slow,"I like the Cruzer Mini drives because they are very slim. You don't even know they're in your pocket. I ordered this one to replace my 1GB Lexar Jump Drive Traveler. The Cruzer is the same size and width as the Lexar, but is about 30% slimmer and it comes with 3 colored caps. Unfortunately, this drive is very slow. It seemed to take forever to copy even the smallest files to it. I benchmarked it using Sisoft Sandra and found that the Lexar is nearly twice as fast at copying small files (under 256k). The two were about the same speed when working with larger files. After using this for 2 days, I finally returned it and ordered a 2GB Lexar Lightning instead. I just couldn't deal with the speed...or lack thereof."
2,Poor Software,I upgraded to this drive as I needed more space. I must say it is the most disappointing mini drive I've owned. The main problem is with the software. I use my drive to carry private information and use a password to protect it. About 1 in 3 times the software won't load. I end up yanking the drive out and trying again.My previous Memorex drive loaded properly about 95% of the time in comparison. If you are a professional wanting to carry data with you from work to home and on the road I would look elsewhere for a more reliable drive.
1,Very disappointing,"Supposedly this baby has 4gb, but don't try to put more than 2gb on it. Twice now mine has has gotten irreparably confused when I tried to copy a large folder to it and, in the process, destroyed other files on the drive.A BIG thumbs down on the 4gb model.By the way, I had a 512 Cruzer that worked flawlessly for several years, which is why I went with Cruzer when I upgraded."
4,a disc firmly committed to its own gregarious eccentricity.,"A fusion of ambient, world beat, other-world beat and, well, fusion itself, this music works best on the vaguely Prime Time-esque ""Sunglasses a la Mode"" (with microtonal guitarist Neil Haverstick) and the punchy ""Albuquerque.""Bret Saunders, The Denver Post"
5,Ninendogs Best Friends,This game is lots of fun.It's probably the best Nintendogs version because it is a mix of all the versions.It has tons of things to do. The only problem is it is the same every day. But still you defenitely SHOULD buy it!!!! It will provide you with hours of fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Not as good as it's predecessor,"I had my old LG for three years until it died. I upgraded to this one and have been wanting my old one back every since. I'll start with cons since they're easy and then add the pros if I can think of any.Cons:- Battery has to be in the phone to be charged. This means you can't keep a spare charged battery on hand. My spare battery is useless.- Dropping calls right and left.- Side buttons to easy to depress - the thing is constantly switching on/off speaker or on/off manner while in my purse. I hate side buttons.- Speaker phone is pitchy and to vibrato to use.I can't think of any specific pros. Aside from the problems mentioned above, it's fine, but I can't wait to replace mine."
3,Easy breezy little phone,"This phone has some great features like:1. easy to use calendar with equally easy to use reminders. You can set appointments and voice-record a short reminder, or just enter the reminder on the keyboard.2. easy to record a voice reminder, and easy to record a phone conversation (one button on the side) helpful for directions or other important info like addresses or emails or fax numbers while talking to your contact. Just play it back when you want.3. No camera - yay.4. Push to talk, with a good speaker.5. Easy to use alarm. It has saved me many times.6. Okay, so the calculator is weird and hard to use.7. Teeny tiny, nice looking phone.8. Good voice recognition to auto dial or hands-free."
2,Amaturish,"This is a story of a poor, struggling lawyer who takes on a case that's impossible to win and pays no money. He wins. Fame and fortune follow. This story has been done over and over and been done better. The opening court scene is a ploy to set up animosity between attorney Ben Kincaid and the prosecutor, his former friend, and is just plain silly. There are attempts to bolster the main plot with side issues...Kincaid's sister unexpectedly leaves her baby with him...his mother shows up...his ex-brother-in-law is tracking a child molester. The main story line, which was mildly interesting, could have been expanded and stood on it's own. As it was, all the little side stories only detract from the main plot and weaken an otherwise good idea for a story."
4,Entertaining,"I really liked this story. I liked how he tied the two different storylines together in the end. This book is funny at times, suspenseful, and an all around enjoyable read."
5,I've been looking for THE author of legal books. He's Him,"This was one of the most gripping and interesting stories I have ever read. It was riveting and never boring. This was the first Berhardt book I have read and I now am looking for all the rest. I am in the service, presently in Kuwait. I found this book in the PX. Much to my disappointment, it was the only William Berhardt book they had. I WILL read the whole series and anything else William Berhardt ever writes. Keep them coming"
2,Uhhh.... again?,"I think this is one of my favorite Naruto movies because at the end of it every character (even Sakura!) fought until they won for this child. This was different for me b/c in every other naruto movie only him and the other main character become stronger but, in this movie everyone got to taste the sweet juice of that never say never mentality. Naruto is and will always be a great fictional inspiration but I did feel like each movie has the same plotline. Naruto meets a lonely or spoiled person and helps them realize that if you believe in yourself anything is possible. I would love to see naruto evolve from this but hey you cant have it all. I suggest you watch this if you feel you don't see the nine tailed fox enough and you wanna see Sakura grow some balls other than that you can save your money."
4,great watch,"A little difficult to put on with the velcro, but all in all great watch for the price and feactures."
4,Pretty good movie,"Pretty good continuation of the saga. Action is good, plot good, wish there was more animation and less static shots."
3,Good first effort,"I bought this DVD with great anticipation, thinking ""Wow, finally an entertainer who won't blame America first, won't attack Christians, and won't use bad words."" And I was right about that. Brad Stine affirms American patriotism, Christian faith and conservative politics, plus his material is suitable for all ages.Even so, this DVD feels like a first effort. Bill Cosby, Stine ain't. But come to think of it, these days Bill Cosby is considered a conservative too.I'm glad to have put money toward wholesome entertainment, and hope doing so encourages further growth both in Brad Stine and in this part of the market."
1,stupid...,"yeah that about sums it up. and once again a right winger proves what liberals have been saying all along: conservatives have no humour. hell look at the blue collar comedy tour. that was nothing but fart jokes. if you want to waste your money on this drink coaster, go right a head.."
1,This man is too angry to be funny.,"I loved the idea of a conservative comedian, so I couldn't wait to see this. But I felt he had an undercurrent of anger in everything he did and I found it very unpleasant to watch."
5,"Awesome blades, but beware of older packaging!!","These blades are top notch and worth every penny. I'm being forced to return my 100-pack because Amazon sent me older packaging and it was NOT the easy dispenser one I ordered; the package received was similar to the 70-pack version. A prompt replacement is on its way; hopefully, that'll be what is pictured on the website or I'll return again and skip it. The container was even partially opened on one side, as if it had been around awhile."
4,Made in China.,"Not sure how they will hold up over time. These generally will only get used in those hard to reach automotive repairs,or if they're right there handy but still good to have in my pliers draw. Many times I have had a need for something like these so we'll see. Still at this price it's worth more than to have then not having when they are needed.I recommend these pliers."
1,Excellent!,"Sheer, nearly poreless, coverage. Easy to apply, great ingredients, improved my overall skin quality. Does not, however, hold up to perspiration. Although I'm 55 & wear it daily, so does my 15 y/r daughter! We both are very picky about our cosmetics & Shat-It is agreeably the best."
3,Good Voice. I am glad it is for God,"Not very original. I was a little disappointed when I heard this CD the other day. Just listening to the music provided mea nothing special type of sound. However, I wish Thomas Ian the best! And, I am glad it is for pleasing God, and the loyal fans who do really rock with him.Peace"
2,"Too Narrow, Too flimsy","These shoes are too narrow, and ""give"" too much.They are not very comfortable or stable. They lack cushioning, arch support and need a stronger shank in the sole. They bow when you walk, instead of supporting you.On the upside they are very pretty."
4,"Its Nice Having ""CORD"" Freedom","These wireless headphones do what they are supposed to do and allow me to listen to my ZEN without the hassle of a cord. It takes a little getting used to as to how the headphones rest on your ears and you wouldn't win a beauty contest with these on, but they do work and work pretty well. I sometimes wear them when doing chores around my house. Even when the headphones lose their connection with the sending unit, the signal comes right back when you are in the ""sweet zone"" which is about 30-35 feet. Great for walks and being outdoors too. Hate them cords!!!"
2,They sound good when they work...,"These headphones sound good when they work. However, they only seem to work intermittantly! I exchanged my first set of V2 Freepulse bluetooth headphones because the headphone would not hold a charge. The second pair I got from the retailer is now doing the same thing after 3+ months: sometimes the headphone charges, sometimes it does not. I have had to use cable ties to hold the on/off button on to keep the charger indicator on to get the batteries to charge. Even after 24+ hours of charging, I cut the cable tie off and use the headphones-- they only seem to last a approx. 25 minutes before dying again. I am going to dispose of these headphones and purchase something by Jabra or Plantronics. Their reliability seems to be much better. I own a Plantronics Discovery 610 bluetooth device--it always works."
3,Average product.,"It is an average product. It is heavy weight on the ears, the volume control is difficult to control, the wire for the receiver is too short, to turn the head phone on and off it takes too long and as price wise I believe it is expensive. The quality of sound is good. I was expecting better before I bought it."
3,Works short Range,"I expected more from this product. After I received it, I see that I expected to much. The rechargeable battery is so small it can only hold a 2 to 2 and a half hour charge.The range it has in real world usage seems to be very limited. I still use the headphones, they provide quiet for my roommate."
2,Good while it lasted.,Return twice. The Vol. switch seems to have been poorly designed. First it cause static noises when turn vol up or down. Next one has problem too. Does not lowers vol. They will send you a replacement only after receiving yours. You apy for shipping to them. Sucks!Would not recommend.
1,wireless headphones,"I wanted a wireless headset to use at the gym. I found that the volume levelhad to be turned to max level and even than , outside noise interfered withthe quality of sound and made it difficult sometimes to understand."
2,Issues with A2DP Cell Phones in Bluetooth mode,"This headset works well in general when you use the dongle provided. Sound is good for non-audiophile.Since it is using bluetooth protocol between the dongle and the headsets, you can actually pair them directly with a bluetooth device such as a computer that supports bluetooth or a cell phone.When I pair this headsets with my computers (one using Kensington Micro USB Bluetooth Adapter and another using Motorola PC850 Bluetooth Adapter), they are working fine. However, when the headsets are paired with cell phones with A2DP profile, the sound is cutting in and out. This is apparently is a known issue if you google ""Freepulse A2DP"".So, if you don't mind using the dongle, this is a good item. But, if you intent to use them with an A2DP compliant cell phone, I'd look elsewhere."
2,Headphones user,"The Logitech FreePulse headphones have a good clear sound, but the attachment that goes over the ear is painful. There was no instruction, or even a picture that confirms how they are to fit onto one's head, so I may have been wearing them incorrectly. I tried them with the main arch between the phones placed around the back of my neck. The soft loops that appear to be meant to loop over the ears were very uncomfortable. I have small ears, so I asked my husband (these were a gift for him) how he liked them when he tried them. His reaction was the same. He said he had to take them off after wearing them an hour or less because they hurt his ears. He said his ears hurt for several hours afterward as well.In the future, it would be a good idea to include a picture, or description with the package of exactly how these are designed to be worn."
3,Decent sound but uncomfortable,"After liking the original Logitech Wireless MP3 headsets, I raced out to buy these once the original's headband cracked. Initially I thought they were a big improvement. Same decent sound quality (very good but not great) and the new flexible headband meant that it wouldn't have the band crack in the middle again. I didn't mind that they could not be adjusted as they ""seemed"" to fit just right, at first. After the first 45 minutes of use, my opinion changed. Boy are they uncomfortable. My ears start to ache every time. I continue to use them because I use them to work out on a treadmill or elliptical and for 45 minutes to an hour a day, I can deal, but if I planned to use these for a couple of hours at a time, I would be very disappointed at the fit.Overall, I recommend them if you plan to use them for shorter periods of time, but be careful if you are going to use them for daily commutes, etc."
4,Would Recommend This Product,"This is a great item if you are on an airplane or sitting at your desk in the office. I use it for both and have been very satisfied. I love using it on the plane because if i have to get up to let another passenger pass i dont have to worry about the wires, etc. and if I myself need to get up to stretch my legs or take a walk the music comes with me but my ipod stays put in the seatback infront of my seat. At the office it's also beneficial because there are no wires to get in the way of my typing or swiveling chair. LOL. Enjoy!"
3,Sound - good - fit - uncomfortable,"The sound on these was very clear and good = however, I didn't like the way they fit in that when I'd turn my head, I could feel it sort of pull or tug on the other ear as the headback band stayed stable and the earphone wanted to move. All in all, I suppose they were good. I was only able to use them once since I accidentally threw them away along with my new Zen player while in a rush, so I'll never know if I'd have gotten used to them after awhile or not. (I ordered another Zen and replaced these headphones by ordering the Creative wireless headphones with a wire instead of a backstrap. I am not thrilled with them either, however.)"
2,Just the sound,"I should have paid more attention to the review comments telling me these headphones were uncomfortable. I already own a behind-the-neck wired headset from Logitech and they are quite comfortable. This wireless set; however, is poorly designed for human beings and they don't fit my cat either.The 'phones and base unit have a hidden link code, so I could not pair the 'phones with my iPAQ; this is very irritating.The batteries for both the base & 'phones are built-in rechargeable so the life of the batteries is the life of the product. The charge on the 'phones lasts maybe 3 hours, not so good at all.I own several Logitech products and am quite satisfied with both the design and value of these items. The FreePulse unit is an exception to this. They pretty much suck.The sound is great though."
2,Low quality,"I have been disappointed with these headphones for several reasons:Uncomfortable - OK, I have a big head and these headphones squeeze my ears so that I can't wear them more than an hour no matter how I adjust them.Reliability - Sound cuts in and out randonmly.Battery life - doesn't last more than 4 hours."
3,Good for you maybe?,"Works great, but the set i had had a delay between the send and receive. Since i wanted to use them as onstage monitors, that made them useless. The tech people at the company told me there should be no delay, but since they worked perfectly otherwise, i really didn't want to go through the hassle of returning, replacing and then probably returning again. Sure would have been nice if they worked....."
4,Great item with great sound...,"Just make sure to buy it from some place with a generous return policy. i'm on my 3rd pair of logitech headphones. this is a testament to both their tendency to malfunction (1 pair quit charging, 1 pair had a headphone jack that went bad), but also to their desirability and function. when they work, they're fantastic...the sound is even better than my high-end (wired) sony headphones, and the fit is comfortable for my small head. i never even know they're there. the connection is reliable for about 25 feet, i'd say, and it's better if you aren't moving around too much. yes, occasionally the sound will randomly cut out for a second, but it doesn't last long, and quite honestly, it doesn't affect the listening experience all that much. they aren't perfect, not at all, but i think they're still the best--and most convenient--wireless headphones on the market."
4,Not bad,The headset pretty much does what it says it will do. If your looking for concert hall sound look eleswhere. But if you looking for something to leave you wireless during a workout and give you reasonable sound this is the product. I thought it had a pretty good price also
1,Do not buy. Only work for 2 months.,"Do not buy these headphones unless you want to keep returning them every 2 months. The first pair I bought worked great for two months. Then they would not turn on after being charged. Pressing the reset button as recommended by support did not work to revive them. I looked in Logitech's support forum and found other people with the same problem. Logitech took the headphones back and sent me another ""new"" pair. It's two months later and guess what? The new ones have stopped turning on after a charge.I really loved the convenience of these headphones. The sound quality is great and not having the cord get in the way during workouts or yardwork was so nice. But you really don't buy them, you just rent them for $100 plus the every-2-months cost of mailing them back and the cost of replacements while you wait for Logitech to ship you a working pair. I want my money back."
4,"Ahh, no tangled wires","I bought the FreePulse Headphones to replace my Sennheiser PMX60 Headphones. The Sennheisers sounded great, but I use a wheelchair and was getting tired of the cord getting caught in the chair's armrests, etc. The FreePulse does away w/this and allows me to store my ZEN in my bag or rest it on a nearby table and still listen to tunes.The sound of the FreePulse is great but may not be quite as good as the $30 Sennheisers. I also like the auto shut-off feature which helps the FreePulse retain it's charge.My problem w/this product is the same as most other reviewers, the rubber rings that wrest on the users ears. It can be uncomfortable and on my set they came off too easily. I don't know how the FreePulse compares to other bluetooth headphones but I'd recommend this to anyone looking to go wireless."
2,THIS IS ANNOYING!,"I haven't really seen anyone with this problem but MY HEADPHONES WON""T TURN ON! AHHH! The power button for the headphones just isn't working. It wasn't working for 2 hours last night then I randomly power it up and poof! They turn on. I turned them off and now it won't come back on. That is poor quality on Logitech's part. I am a little dissappointed. While they were on, it was sweet."
1,A Total Waste of Money,"This is an awkward, difficult product...uncomfortable to wear; troublesome to synch up; clumsy to operate. It's over-priced, ill-conceived and definitely not worth the aggravation."
4,Comfortable Wirefree Headphones,Have been using this new Logitech FreePulse Wireless Headphones for a couple of weeks. Its really great to be able to listen to music without any wires running around. I bought it for use in Gym. Its very useful especially on the treadmill and cross trainer.Pros- Clear sound quality(Has an in built bass mode)- Comfortable- StylishCons- Headphone are a bit heavier(Its only beacuse it has a battery inside)- Headphones are non-adjustable.All in all a good wireless headphone
3,Not what I needed.,This product is listed as a bluetooth compatible headset. I bought it for an Insignia MP3 player. The only way this headset would innerface with the MP3 is through its adapter which had to be plugged into the MP3. I sent the headset back and am completely satisfied with the prepaid label Amazon sent to me. The headsets are great if you don't have bluetooth capability.
4,Excellent Headset - Love its light weight!,The headset works quite well. I am most impressed by its light weight. The sound quality is very good. You do need to adjust the ear loops for a comfortable fit. Once you do that the headphones are very pleasant to wear for long periods of time.
4,Pretty good,"ProsVolume controls on ear pieceGood quality soundConsDoes space out even from close range - 1 foot - but for < a secondBass boost not must difference, but still good soundThe behind the head earphones do not fit as comfortably as the common Sony kind, they get a little uncomfortable after a while and require readjustment.Additional ThoughtsEven though the cons outnumber the pros, I still like these and the wireless feature is really nice. No more cord to get tangled or in the way."
2,Sound great but VERY uncomfortable,"I was torn if to buy these or not; everyone admitted they sounded great, but half the ppl said they were uncomfortable and the other half not. I was hoping to be in the latter...not. I can barely make it through 30 mins and then they become unbearable to wear. i have tried adjusting, to no avail. unfortunately Buy. com will not exchange for a different model(even though it's only been 3 weeks since shipping), so Im basically 90 bucks out of luck. if u happen to be among the ones that can wear these comfortably, then you'll be probably be happy. they cut out (for a sec or two), but not that frequently to really be bothered by"
3,Good but could be better.,These headphones are good but they are not as comfortable as I would like.Also the battery life is a little short. They have a good soulnd and they were easy to work with. They make a good spare.
3,Computer problem,"I have been using the headphones for ipod and they have worked fine, except in cold weather. But when I use them for my computer and go online with them the headphones interfere with the internet connection and takes a lot longer to load things and sometimes it does not load at all. So if you are looking to buy headphones for your computer then do not buy these ones, get one with a wire."
3,Logitech Wireless Headphones,"I enjoy the freedom of wireless. My only disappointment is the battery runs out after about 6 hours of use. I use this product at work and it solved the problem I had of always running over my cord with my chair, but I can't listen all day, I have to take them off and charge them again, which makes it hard to use them. Otherwise, they fit well, great sound, and the signal travels pretty far."
3,nor robust enough for crowded bluetooth place,"Be careful if you have a lot of bluetooth sources around this headset. It consistently disconnects and/or interrupts the connection with its own source. I tried it on two units, the first one was unusable, the second is OK so far, but not as robust I would expect. The fact is that it is still probably best value in its class but there is a lot to improve on the reliability of this device.Sound quality is above average, but comfort could be better. Head wrap gets in the way sometimes, otherwise sits pretty solid. Great for workout but not for long term quality listening. I decided to keep it.BTW, it connect seamlessly with third party bluetooth sources, such as computer dongles. Forget IPhone, that is mono anyway, but even in that mode it will not connect."
2,Open range,"At first I was well pleased with the Freepulse headphones, though the range could be better. Then it began, they started doing their own thing. The headphones will disconnect (lose pairring with the adapter) and start searching for its mate to re-pair with. Over and over again. I'm currently in email contact with tech support (and they were Johnny-on-the-spot to reply to my call for help) and they are working with me to help resolve this situation. If asked for a recommendation to purchase this product, I am sorry to say that they would not be at the top of my list."
4,Good headphones,These headphones are pretty good. There is an occasional audio drop off for no apparent reason.
3,rubber band very uncomfortable,I cannot stand to wear it more than 20 minutes. Not very ergonomic. Sound sometimes breaks up.
1,Not for heavy use,"I purchased these to be used while traveling as well as around my house as I often have various news wires that I dont want to have blaring on speakers. I am now on my 5th, yes 5th, pair of these poorly constructed head phones and while the sound is adequate they continually stop working. I am not working out, running, or doing any motions which may seem aggressive so if that's your purpose then stay away. When traveling I have a backpack designed to carry photographic equipment into the field and the headphones have a small space designed for a lens, so needless to say its highly protected and padded. If you happen to have a glass box that can perpetually suspend these headphones in mid-air and only plan to listen to them while sitting in a bed of cotton balls then by all means purchase these. If you are looking for something that can withstand normal use, however, then keep on searching...."
3,Good set of headphones but barely close to perfect,I have used these mostly for my Dell Axim X50v pocket pc.Pros-Cordless-Descent sound-Adjustable on the ear-Lightweight-Comes with a bluetooth adapter-Very sturdy-Great battery life-PriceCons-Sound is a little off-sync with video-Get a little uncomfortable on the ears after a while-Can't plug in headphones to charge and listen through them at the same time.-Can't move around a lot(eg mowing) or the sound cuts out a lot.
2,OHHH NOO!,"My husband bought me these headphones for my birthday. Its a great concept but everything kept going wrong! They are uncomfortable if you wear them for long periods. The range was horrible. I would have the adapter and my ipod clipped to my belt and wear the headphones; when I would bend down the music would stop. I believe (if I remember correctly) the manual said it had a battery like of 6 hours, I had only 1.5 hours. I also think it was because I kept changing the songs.I really wanted to love these headphones but I returned them. Hopefully in time they will fix all these problems cause I really loved the idea of having cordless headphones!"
2,For small minds,"This product is everything that Logitech says it is. For the most part I really like these headphones. They work really well, and while their sound isn't going to blow your mind, it's good enough for the casual listen.The HUGE problem that these headphones have is in their comfort level. Or should I lack thereof! All I ever wanted was stupid pair of bluetooth headphones so I could be wireless and listen to my TV at night without waking up the house.You'd think that someone could put something like that on the market."
2,Volume + BONGING NOISE drives me nuts.,The Bonging Sound Noise when you use the + volume control - IS VERY ANNOYING AND IT DRIVES ME NUTS.Now I do not use the headset volume + when I want to increase the volume - I have resorted to having to use the Ipod volume control - this is annoying also since I am supposed to be able to use the headset control.Maybe I am just too picky.
1,sound quality good but incredibly uncomfortable,"When I bought this it wasn't clear that it was a behind-the-ear type of headphone. Small, lightweight, sound quality good, but incredibly uncomfortable to wear. Ears hurt after a while."
1,Defective Product - No Support,The Freepulse was nice (although uncomfortable) when it worked. After about three weeks - the headphone no longer work and would not charge. Per Logitech forum - it is some kind of issue with the batteries and it is a known issue. I have submitted two tickets and posted on their forum - so far no response after three weeks. The question is - do you want to gamble $80 and hope that your Freepulse will work....
4,go wireless,I had been looking at wireless headphones for my ipod for over a year and was very excited when I saw the price on the factory refurbished set I bought. The only minor glitch was they came with no instruction sheets or documentation at all. I found them on the Logitech web site and got up and rolling. I love the wireless while I am working in my yard or out walking. I still use my earbuds for working out because the wireless headset is a little to heavy on my ears for that. My only complaint is that ever so ofter I will get a music drop out for a second for no apparent reason. I don't know if it is interference from other bluetooth products or what and it is very random. Overall I am very satisfied with the product and recommend them to any one who wants to go wireless.
3,Good overall with some problems,"Overall I like the Logitech FreePulse headphones, but they have some issues. The wireless feature is great, and the sound on these headphones is pretty good.The main problem is that when I use it on my bike, the signal isn't very consistent. It will cut out intermittently at times and work perfectly at other times. The rubber pieces which go behind your ears to hold the headphones in place can also get uncomfortable after a while.Overall I like the headphones, but those problems are a bit irritating."
2,Loved 'em until they quit working...,"I bought these after doing a little research on them first. I wanted headphones that were good sound quality, decent range, and still allowed you to hear things going on around you. The were great for about a week...then they simply quit working. Tech support told me to go through the return process. I reported the problem to customer service, gave them the information they wanted, they said I should hear back in 10-14 days...It's been over a month now, and I have sent several additional emails with no response from customer service...In summary: If the product doesn't stop working for no appearant reason, you should like them. If you have a problem with them..."
3,Far too many limitations,"I had hoped the fones would stay static free in the 33 foot range advertised. But that diameter is only good inside the room of the iPod. When I add on a 33 foot home office with microwave, coffe maker and minibar I'll be good to go. In the mean time I'll sequester myself in my 12X15 home office and put a reminder on the door not to leave unless I'm craving some serious white noise. Advice: Stick with Sennheiser."
3,"Sounds great, but didn't fit my big head","The quality of sound that comes through these headphones are great. The only problem that I had with it is that my head was too big for them, and there was no way of adjusting the headphones to be more comfortable. I don't think I have an abnormally large head, but who knows."
4,Great Headphones for the Bucks!,Easy set up! Great sound in both my Ipod Video and Sansa e260! I thought they were very uncomfortable until I figure out exactly how to wear them and now I find them quite comfortable. Get them! A great sounding headphone for a good price and being wireless is priceless!
3,"Good sound, terrible fit","Despite some reviews that I'd read I decided to give these a try. The sound is great, only noticed a little less clarity then compared to standard headphones.The fit however is terrible. The band would rub my neck and not amount of adjustment seemed to make any difference. Also the tension on the ears is way to much, after about ten minutes the crushing feeling really gets to you.I would not recommend these to anyone."
3,"Less filling, taste great","It's the great contradiction. They work great I can use them on anything that has an earphone plug on it. (TV, Computer, Sterio, iPod, anything!)The range is fine the sound is quite good. BUT...............they are unbearably uncomfotable. A little cutting alot of bending and a little twist to the silicone ear straps and they are now ok. What a shame that something so versital is so uncomfortable."
5,Wonderful,"I have been using these headphones almost daily and they have worked wonderfully from day one. The audio clairity is great, and the side volume control allows me a surprising amount of precision. Besides freeing me from a mess of cord, what I really like is the flexible body. I know some have complained about it's non adjustable form but I happen to have a fairly large head so it's a non-issue. If I were to give it a fault, it can take a bit of adjusting to find a perfect sit, but once you do you can wear them for well over an hour comfortably."
4,Get This,"This is the first time I have used wireless headphones and I'm glad I got this. It is a bit pricey, but it all worked out in the end! Just like everyone else, I got stuck on the instructions and tried to turn it on for 30 minutes. You push(and hold!) the button on the headphones til its blinking red. Then push and hold the button on the transmitter til its blinking red and then both should turn blue and connect. Also, it does take a while to charge, 2 1/2 hrs, on the first run. I got this today at 4:30pm and it just finished charging at 7pm! Other than that, I'm happy!(I'm a hard to please person!)"
4,Great Headset with one minor issue,"I have had my set for over a year and I am very pleased with them. The one issue I have is that the rings that seat around the ear pieces and then loop over your ear. They seam to have loosen over time and don't stay seated. You have to hold them on while putting the headset on. Once on, they don't come off until you take the headset off because they can't come off while wearing them.The other thing is that these used to retail for $99.00 and you could get them for around $79.00. I noticed that the price of these have gone way up.Overall, I think these are great and I continue to use them even with the ring issue. Maybe I can get new rings."
3,"good quality, however did not work forever.","it was a great product for the time that it was working. shortly after i got it it stopped working, and the headphones would no longer turn on."
2,UNCOMFORTABLE - NOT GREAT SOUND,"I have to agree with most reviewers: These headphones are uncomfortable and the sound is not great. It's hard to understand because I have behind the head headphones from Sennheiser (portable with wires) which are very comfortable with good sound, and also remote headphones from Sennheiser which have much better sound than Logitek (unfortunately they are not designed for a MP3 player).It's too bad because I've always had good results with Logitek."
2,not very good,"I am not a sound expert. I bought these about 9 months ago to be able to walk on my treadmill and listen to my stereo. The treadmill is in the bedroom and stereo is in the living room. When the sound is working the quality is fine, but the problem is it cuts in and out often. It has gotton to the point that I have quit using them.Also they are not very comfortable to wear. I pull them down to the bottom of my ear, which has made them more comfortable."
2,Elastic loops for ears,"Overall the sound is nice, but the comfort level is terrible. I think it's for specific types of ""skinny"" heads. After about an hour, I can't wear them because there is zero padding.Also, I've had mine for about a year, and after about 3 months, the elastic pieces that loop onto your ear gets streched out and constantly comes loose from the headset. Nothing is more annoying than turning your head, and all of a sudden it slips off the headset, the headset drops and the elastic pieces goes flying and you have to go look for it. completely annoying."
4,Logitech FreePulse Wireless Headphones,"These headphones work well, were a decent price and were fairly easy to set up (read the directions first!) My only issue, is that I wish the charger would have come with a plug that was compatible for the country I live in...instead, I needed to buy an adaptor. Good other than that."
2,"Owned 2 pairs, both broke!","Alright, for wireless bluetooth they are perfect. I have owned 2 different pairs over the last two years and consider myself an expert. They are great, and love them very much. The absence of cords and wires is lovely, but for me the buttons used to turn the separate pieces are too fragile (my headphones button stopped working on the first pair). And on the second pair the headphones stopped charging.For a pair of headphones with a MSRP as high as this, they should last longer than a year."
3,Good but not worth the money,I bought these to run in. They work fine and the range is ok. They are about 8 months old and they will not power up. I suspect the sweat got into them as I see some of the screws rusted. I would think for the money they should at least make it a whole year. They are also very umcomfortable and wearing them longer then 40 minutes is difficult.
2,when it worked it was very nice,"when i first got this, i really liked the product.deep bass, loud volume, could really broadcast far in a house.however, when i started riding my bike with these on, it cut out frequently. it seems that motions such as turning your head will cause it to lose reception. tried placing the receiver at various places on my body.after several months, sound only came out of one earpiece until i jiggled the receiver. eventually, even that stopped working.went to go call logitech support and create an RMA. no luck. the number on the website was dead and found no way to submit electronically.their support sucks."
4,Good headphones - a bit bulky,"Great concept - no wires to get in your way. Headphones are bulky in size, but still lightweight. Had an issue with the first set and they were replaced free of charge. Overall good quality, but wish they were a bit smaller."
2,Doesn't work in the cold?,"Worked well first couple of weeks, but then headphones stopped turning on and audio quality diminished when they were turned on. Maybe the problems were caused by the cold? I haven't called customer support about it, yet."
4,Logitech wireless headphones,"It's pretty good. There are better products out there that are pricier, but they cover the ears and that wouldn't be good for work. It doesn't last for an 8 hour day which is expected, just give it a charge during lunch if you want it to. You do have to hold the button down for quite a while to get it to turn off, I guess that's so you don't accidentally shut it down. I like that it's really easy to use, it's just a little mini jack, so anywhere you can jack in, you can use these headphones. ""These headphones"" or ""this headphone?"" bah, silly english language."
3,FreePulse,It works fine and looks cool. Only 3 minor complaints:1. Battery life: the headphone's battery is used up 2 times faster than the transmitter. Need to charge it almost everyday to keep it going.2. Doesn't connect to my N95 bluetooth.3. Poor base... think my cheap Sony MDR-E829V performs better in base range
4,Great sound...,"Great sound and good battery life. The only downside is the fit. It is slightly uncomfortable at times, and I can see where it may even be unusable for a larger sized head."
4,recommended!,"Lots of good things about this. Sound is excellent, it's easy to use, and seems fairly durable. A way to adjust the pressure against your ears would be an improvement, as the headphones get fatiguing after an hour or so. But for the money, it's great."
2,Died after a year!! No response from customer service!!!,"These headphones were wonderful. They were easy to use, comfortable, and the sound quality was great! They were my favorite set of headphones, for the shear fact that they were wireless, and the range was amazing. Then, after only a year of use, the headphones quit responding to the receiver! Granted, I did use these quite a bit, but for the money that I spent on them, I expected them to last much longer! I tried to contact Logitech about it, but I guess they had better things to do, because they never answered back!!"
3,More experienced than most,"I have owned 7 of these. 5 lasted less than a week before they went by the boards. One lasted a long time possibly because I sprung for the extended warranty, But unfortunately I ran over it with my car which I'm sure wasn't covered. The last is still operational and working fine. They tend to be uncomfortable unless you don't use the rubber over the ear things, and then you can adjust them for comfort. The sound is good and can be adjusted loud enough to be used in noisy environments which is not true of some wireless sets I have used. If they were not so prone to be defective I would highly recommend them as I really love the product when it works."
3,a bit of disappointment,"Pro: sound is clear, no background noise. It can also pair up with other bluetooth device w/o it's adaptor.Con: the range is too short. It's more like a 10 feet range not 30 feet as they advertised. If you decide to turn to different direction, you will get about 1~2 second of black out.Other thoughts: those earbud with the rubber holder sits comfortable on my ear after a few adjustment for the right angle to fit in position. If they are making a new generation of this model, they should use a holder that can be bend&memorize; each individual's ear shape.Bottom Line: This is a very nice earphone if you're only to use this in the same room(short range). If you want to walk around the house with it, I would consider a different model with a better range."
2,logitech,"The item lost signal every minute or so when walking or jogging. This is terrible if you are trying to work out. The company, 3Btech, found nothing wrong, so I suspect the product is no set optimally for joggers. I sent it back and it cost me $20 to find this out.Would not rec.J"
3,Power Button Is Horrible,"I really like these headphones from a convenience standpoint, no wires is awesome and being that it's bluetooth you can range pretty far. Also the overall weight compared to previous wireless headphones is amazing. As others have mentioned long usage is not comfortable, the top of your ears will really start to become sore after about 45mins. But my main concern is with the power button located on the headphones, it seems like it is getting progressively harder to get them to turn on. You have to press and hold at just the right spot for sometimes up to 10secs or more, sometimes 2 or 3 times before it finally turns on."
4,Logitech FreePulse,"Being tired of hung by wires, I began a seach for bluetooth headsets. I wasn't even sure they existed. Long story short I decided to try the logitech FreePulse. Good price and reputable name. Good product. Looks good, easy to pair with the transmitter that comes with it. I used the 1/8 plug wire to connect to my ipod. Some reviewers worried about the adapter coming out, but no big deal using the wire. Easy controls and good sound. Takes a little getting used to on the ears. I highly reccommend them."
2,Problem with Quality Control,"I tried two sets of these headphones. The first stopped charging when plugged in. The second just stopped transmitting sound. Both failed within the first week. Other than that, they are a little uncomfortable, but not much. They work pretty well, but they have a fair number of dropouts. Sound quality is decent as is the volume. Batteries go flat in the headphones before the transmitter and do not usually last the day, so I usually carry a spare pair of wired headphones. Now of course I've given up on them."
2,Short battery life,"I have a small MP3 player that I clip to my belt at the gym and thought this would be a great complement to elimnate pesky cords. I was very happy up until the battery on the headset developed a memory and now only lasts a few minutes before dying. Had it not even a year. I called Logitech and they confirmed it is susceptible to this if not drained completely prior to recharging. Otherwise, sound quality was good and the volume controls are easy to use just requiring a quick tap up or down. But since it doesn't work once the battery dies I give it a low rating no matter how easy to use or great the sound quality."
2,Very uncomfortable,Sound quality is OK but the loops around your ears are very uncomfortable. Can't wear for over an hour.
4,I like it,"I read the reviews and knew what I was getting into when I bought this. Yeah, the plastic thingy in the back of my head is annoying and gets caught on my collar sometimes, but for the most part, so what? NO CORDS! And it hasn't broken, yet. It's so worth it. And recharging is a pain, but really I just charge the headset and bluetooth thingy at the same time that I recharge my ipod, so it works out ok. The design could be better, I wish I could skip songs from the earpiece like I can adjust the volume, but I don't regret buying this item AT ALL. I use them at work and walk around with them on (the range is great!) and I use them at the gym and they have been problem free!"
5,"Very good, comfortable no matter what others say","Very good product. I got it refurbished. Great sound, bluetooth connection is always good although the range isn't huge (doesn't need to be), and when you're staying too far, it cuts out instead of degrading the sound. Controls to mute and volume are placed well. Others have said these become uncomfortable, but I haven't thought so -- maybe since I don't have a head the size of a basketball."
4,Muy buenos,"son bien soportan aproximadamente 6 horas de uso, lo unico tienen a calentar las orejas, y si te gustan con full bajo son para ti por eso le doy 4 de 5 me gustan mas los sonidos agudos."
4,Logitech FreePulse Wireless Headphones,Works great but a little uncomfortable. Can not wear them all day.Sound is great. Running with them is easy.
3,Sounds great when they work,"I have had several problems with these headphones. I use it with my t-mobile dash and windows media player. The headphones connect to the device but loses the connection after every song. Occasionally it will keep the connection, and then I absolutely love them. Also works great with my A2DP enabled laptop and WMP.Sound quality is pretty good, they are not the most comfortable headphones I have worn. Would be a lot better if the headband was adjustable and they should have shipped with a couple different size ear straps. Overall, a great idea, they look great, but execution is about average."
1,Battery life is a bust,"Overall, these headsets met expectations. Excellent sound quality, solid 30' range in areas you would expect a lot of interference and pretty comfortable.The deal breaker for us is the short battery life. Can't get more than two hours out of the system without a recharge. To add insult to injury, when we called Logitech to find out if we could use a portable battery pack to extend the life the support tech was rude and indifferent. Basically, acted like everyone should know these things have a short battery life and there is no way around it.The Cyber Acoustics ACM 500 headphones look like they have a similar form factor and are rated at a 7 hr battery life. I haven't used them but it would be worth looking at if you need more than 2 hrs of play time."
1,beware:this item is not made by logitech anymore for a reason,"I bought my 1st pair about 3 years ago.They lasted about a year and then stopped pairing up.Logitech actually had a good warranty and swapped them out for a good pair.They lasted 6 months and then same problem,stopped pairing.I was told by logitech that they stopped selling them and they offered me a pair of bluetooth headsets which did me no good for my needs.I noticed they are still selling these things and decided to write this review because you should know-it dies it aint getting fixed."
1,Disappointed after 2 years!!,"2 returns, 1 service call, and a defective plug ALL in 2 years warrants for an unhappy customer!! I had to return 2 of these because the plastic piece that clips on your ear came off and they could not send just the replacement piece. Just yesterday, the adapter plug will not turn on and I'm told the warranty was up 3 weeks ago. I would not reccommend this product. I have had nothing but trouble with them and I've only used them a few dozen times."
3,"Disappointing, but not entirely so...","I mean, this is a lesbian vampire video, so how bad can it be? The problem I have with this particular movie is that, despite its title, there's no real seductions going on. And that's a shame, too, as seeing a beautiful sexy lesbian vampire seducing her pretty prey before putting the bite on her would be quite an erotic experience! Unfortunately, the writers lack creativity and imagination in this regard. And so, what we end up with is just another semi-erotic video with a lot of pretty naked girls in it! No, that's not a bad thing, but it could be SO MUCH BETTER with just a little effort!"
1,Avoid at all costs!,"As dedicated fans of this genre, my wife and I were extremely disappointed to find that this ""film"" (it really doesn't have the level of quality to be classified as such) was just another badly-acted low-browed poorly-scripted non-erotic blunder. Watching this was a waste of our time, and it will be a waste of yours, as well. This is the first movie that we're actually trying to return; we want our money back, and even if we do get the money we're still going to regret spending the time to watch it.As another point of irritation, the other reviews here praised this film. Why? The film was beyond bad, and it leaves me wondering what the other reviewers were thinking. One of the most valuable services that Amazon offers are these product reviews; I'm sorry that (at least on this occasion) the reviews were clearly misleading.Don't watch this film. You'll be sorry if you do :("
1,Mistaken seduction,"For those of you who enjoy a few naked vampires, this movie will only be partly fullfilling - example, a woman gets in the bath, but she's still wearing her panties! What's the point in that? The plot is minimal, a vampire woman must seduce a man because he killed her master in a previous re-incarnation!? Talk about stupid. This film's also shot on video, so don't expect a big-budget effect. Leave this one behind."
4,killa vamp chick fight flick!,"Wowwee, good wicked stuff here. Lead vamp was hot hot hot hot hot! In other words, hot! Also the chick who played enemy of the vampire was also hot - even hotter if you are into blondes! Loved seeing them kick each others butts. One of 'em steps on the other one's head! Then they punch each other and slap each other, like a catfight vamp flick!If you like seeing chick vamps fight and rip each other and their hapless prey, you're gonna love Mistress of S!"
3,Vampirina soo fine,"The Girls are natural and hot! The lead girl has talent a good BITCH!. The other ""GOOD"" girl looks great and seems warmer.then the back ground eyecandy is nice as well.The males seemed to be lifeless great IF the were already vampired. The FX are good the blood bath scene. was really well done.A great effort i hope the co makes more and better entertainmentin the future."
1,Dangerous,"The button on the sweater came off RIGHT away--with no rough use--exposing a potentially dangerous piece of metal. This Haba item is made in China, not in Germany where the wooden toys are made. The doll is beautiful and our daughter loved it. If they improve the design and figure out how to manufacture this doll with the same care they give their wooden toys, I would buy it again--but not until they fix their process."
5,A wonderful friend,"I gave this doll to my daughter last Christmas (she was about 1 and a half at the time) and she has only gotten more popular. The doll is really cute and very well made and I like the way she is sturdy, but still flexible. The clothes are very fun and durable. My only complaints are that the doll is only handwashable not machine washable and the pants are a little tricky to get on and the shoes are very hard to get on. My daughter (almost 3) can get the dress and jacket on and off by herself and can do the shorts if she works at it, but definately not the shoes. I will definitely consider getting a sister for this doll."
5,the best european metal band ever!!!!,those guys are genius! you just have to listen them! i have been in 5 their concerts. what a power! what an energy! and songs about history and folk are great! music and content which lifts you up for a long while! and most of all- make you think and feel!i adore that band! and there is a reason...

2,"OK, with a major fault","I bought this phone system after a 2.4 ghz AT&T died on me after a year of use. The cost of this system is certainly a bonus as this system is a lot cheaper than the other 2 handset cordless phone system. My initial reaction was that this is a good system, the sound is good, and the batteryt life is fine.However, after a few days. My wife and tried to get on the phone at the same time. IT DOES NOT WORK. Both handsets can not be used at once. There is a call transfer function, to transfer the call from one phone to another, but both can't be used at the same time."
2,It's ok....but I'm replacing it,"I got this phone thinking it would be great - the extra handset is a nice feature and I like that part. I have noticed that the battery life is pretty short and once when I was talking the battery died and then my phone never ""hung up"" - so for 15 minutes I was without a phone and could not pick up any phone in the house to use it. This has happened two times and is soooo frustrating, especially since the other phones in the house that are corded could not be used.You can't use the 2 phones at once so that is a bit of an inconvenience as well. The reception is ok but it has it's moments. I have had the phone for about 6 months so it's broken in and the honeymoon's over. I am going to replace it, it was a nice try to get a cheaper phone but it's been more trouble than it's worth."
4,One of the best portables I've bought,"I've gone through a lot of portable phones, and especially for the price, this is by far the best. The Caller ID doesn't seem to function, but neither did the previous phone on our system. Great sound, nice having two handhelds."
2,Rave Culture 1 Laswell 0,"Some of this works, but too much doesn't. I look to artists like Laswell & Ryuichi Sakamoto to help me see the worth in styles I might otherwise find vacant or uninteresting. Regrettably, that doesn't really take place here."
4,A superb look at a fascinating creature,"I'd never watched this 2007 program before, but it was clearly a painstaking effort to document everything about a remarkable creature, the Northern elephant seal. Dr. Sylvia Earle, sounding like the science teacher you always wish you had, does the narration. The videography is simply beautiful, and there are facts of interest for everyone: I'd read about the species but never knew how it had survived almost certain extinction. A tour of a kelp forest is one of the interesting byways taken in following the seal's migration.Matt Bille, Author, SHadows of Existence: Discoveries and SPeculations in Zoology (Hancock, 2006)"
5,Best Buddhas Around,"What a neat book. The diversity of images is really impressive. Having traveled to many of the places pictured in the book, it was fun to try to figure out where they were taken. It shows there is a place for the Buddha in everyone's life."
5,A fantastic find,Quite entertaining and fun! I would never have imagined Buddha's presence to be so vast and varied. The photography is creative and surprising. The inspiring introduction increases one's appreciation for the book's message. Looks great on the coffee table too!
3,123456789101112131415.............................,"be warned, there is a lot of counting in this album. the songs in this album are more like mini science experiments exploring various combinations and permutations rather than a music album for listening pleasure. some songs are quite good like ""not ours"" which sounds a bit like the talking heads. still, a little less counting might have made it easier to get through the record without feeling exhausted."
5,Review of Arthur's Lost Library Book,"I recommend this DVD for family viewing to everyone. My kids, ranging from 5 years old to 14 years old, still enjoy watching the series. Since there is not much of a selection for family viewing on our local stations, we decided to create a DVD library. This was one voted by the kids as well as the parents to have. The three episodes included in this DVD edition are: (1) Arthur's Lost library book-about Arthur losing the latest Scare-Your-Pants-Off book from the library; (2) D.W.'s Imaginary Friend-D.W.'s new imaginary friend, Nadine, moves into the house and follows D.W everywhere, even to the Amuzement Park, much to Arthur's dislike; (3) D.W.'s Libary Card-about D.W. getting her first library card."
2,Where's the map?,"The Great Fire of London by Neil Hanson traces the progress of the conflagration street by street, building by building on all its fronts. Unfortunately the publishers did not include any useful maps so the reader could follow the progress. This oversight detracts fatally from Hanson's exciting and dramatic narrative.Hanson does not give a proper examination of the long term effects of the fire. His examination of short terms effects is cursory. The book ends with a discussion of pyromania.The Great Fire of London is enjoyable (what a complement to give a disaster), but not completely satisfying."
2,Too much fiction,"Too much novelesque fictional fluff obscuring the facts. A whole paragraph devoted to how someone tosses a loaf of bread is too much. I fell asleep after page 4 and couldn't go on. I want to learn about the fire not read a bedtime story about 17th century England. You can tell the author did a lot of research, it's a shame that he fluffed it up so much with his own fictional image of 17th century London life."
1,Beware S & W knives,"I bought a Smith & Wesson folding lock back with black handle nearly like this one. It was the Cuttin' Horse. The handle broke in no time. The seller (dealer) said I would have to deal with S & W for repair or replacement. And then S & W said that I would have to deal with the knife manufacter. And the run around starts. Now I just hang it on the wall to remind me to never do business with knives from S & W again, and any other items that advertises S & W that they don't actually make them selves. Thanks ""Kuulbobs"""
1,Espresso 101 Barista Training DVD,Does this Training DVD come in English? I cannot read subtitles through a whole DVD when I am trying to train my new Employees! I don't know whether to cancel my order and try to find an English version or if it only comes in Spanish? It would sure be nice if you could actually talk to a human on Amazon.com. They give you no way to contact anyone!Espresso 101 Barista Training DVD
1,Espresso DVD - Training,"My daughter, who is 25 and has worked for 10 years as a Barista in Seattle and Spokane, considers this boring and virtually useless compared to hands on training she received from experienced Baristas. Her boss insisted she watch it."
2,Strewwelpeter:Fearful Stories and Vile Pictures to instruct,"While the pictures in this book are very well drawn, they are thoroughly over the top in appearance and do make this version of the book quite grotesque. As a child I really enjoyed theses stories, but this version just really turned me off."
5,Struwwelpeter,"This is an excellent read. In reference to the advice of most readers of Struwwelpeter to NOT let children read this book, I would like to quote Terry Pratchet: ""...it was much earlier than that when most people forgot that the very oldest stories are, sooner or later, about blood. Later on they tookt he blood out to make the stories more acceptable to children, or at least to the people who read them to children rather than the children themselves (who, on the whole, are quite keen on blood provided it's being shed by the deserving. That is to say, those who deserve to shed blood. Or possibly not. You never quite know with some kids.)""As an educator and once-child, I would reccommend this book to children over the age of 10. Of course this reading experience, like any, should involve a discussion with the parents so they can understand the differences between being a child of the Victorian era and being a child now.Give kids credit!!"
5,Dr Katz Professional hilarity,"This is without a doubt the funniest and sharpest piece of entertainment to be created for any forum in such a long time,that it deserves a genre defining lounge of it's own.The interplay between Dr Katz and his son Ben is a show within itself.All of the patients do what we all do but actually bring it to life,with their observations and views that come straight from their frontal lobes,they are in no way supressed and live the inner life out in the open,which makes for startlingly funny observations and interplay between all involved.I even found myself seeing these characters as more and more human in form as the episodes moved on.To pick a favorite would be folly,just relax and be thankful that Dr Katz Ben and Laura have an office that is so filled with hilarity just sitting back and enjoying is your only requirement.Ian."
5,Great collection!,"Perfect purchase with an unbeatable price, fast shipping, and great quality. The down-tempo bluesy humour is fantastic to chill with late at night. Introspective, yet keeps me laughing on the inside."
4,a fun book!,"I had never heard of Sandra Lee until I saw this book on a library shelf. I checked it out based on the (beautiful) food photos. My kids and I have had a great time with this cookbook! My kids like to help in the kitchen, and a lot of these recipes utilize ready-made items (angel food cakes, pound cakes, etc.) that make it easy for my kids to help or even make these 'fancy' desserts themselves! It is true, most of these recipes are not the same quality or taste as homemade, but the kids really enjoy the professional appearing desserts that they are able to make from this book."
1,Better off just eating a blob of canned icing,I am thrilled I was smart enough to check this out of the libary and not waste my money. I cannot believe she is allowed to get away with this trash she calls cooking. What is with that mess she calls a stage cake? just a bunch of canned icing thrown on some boxed cake mix and decorated with derranged looking plastic clowns. PLease Sandra Lee stop insulting us with your ridiculous recipes.
1,Sugar overload!!,"As I browsed through her cookbook for a possible addition to my marathon cookie making week, I noticed that her recipes were as much work or MORE than recipes that I was using from Gourmet, Bon Appetit, and other magazines and cookbooks that you would assume to be ""labor-intensive."" I used one recipe from this cookbook- harvest walnut. Compared to the 6 other cookies I served one night, the harvest walnut tasted so much like preservatives and butter (NOT a good thing!), that I was tempted to toss them out. The rest of her recipes are laden with sugar and obvious preservatives, and some of the recipes are just gross looking with the amount of frosting or pre-packaged foods-- I HATE those store-bought packaged muffins, and she uses things like that all the time! Gross!Do yourself a favor and stop using the prepackaged mixes and try doing it from scratch-- it will be well worth your time and this cookbook is a waste of time, money, and your health!"
3,Not every recipe is for everyone,"I have many of her books, some are better than others. As far as using ""canned"" frosting in her recipes, have you ever seen cookbooks published by the makers of frostings and cake mixes? There are books devoted to using cake mixes just for cookies and different desserts and their own frosting, not homemade. So what is the difference if she uses them?Judging from what I see purchased in stores, especially dollar stores, most people do not want to be bothered using any cutlery or plates that have to be washed when they have parties. This is a disposable world and nothing is going to change it."
1,More sour than sweet...,"I had a good laugh reading this in the bookstore the other day. Just looking at the pictures made me want to puke. Crisco for lipgloss? Chocolate box with ""mousse""? Truffles made out of frosting and powdered sugar? You call those frickin' truffles? Seems more like a fat kid's dream come true than gourmet cooking.What really took the cake (okay, pun intended!) was the infamous Kwanzaa cake. If my memory serves me correct, that freak of nature had Corn Nuts on it! Corn Nuts! On a damn cake! That was about as bad as those powdered-sugar-frosting confections that she calls truffles.Save your money and don't give this so-called ""cook"" any more money than she's already made off this shill. Dig out your old cook books and make healthy, homemade recipes, food that won't prematurely drive you to your grave. The Joy of Cooking, Fannie Farmer, and all those good old cookbooks are your best bets. Heck, even the White Trash Cookbook is better than this."
1,Breathtakingly Bad,"OK, she recommends using flavored Crisco as a lipgloss!!That should be enough to scare you away .. but there's more. And it's NOT good.Cool Whip, oodles of canned frosting, canned biscuits. Dream Whip!! Yes, they still make it and she commands you to use it.Anyone with a first grade education can buy an angel food cake and slather it with canned frosting. You do not need her 10 or so ""recipes"" for how to do this.This is not a book for busy people who want to make something quick and tasty. It's a book for people would apply canned frosting to twinkies and serve it to guests."
1,Did she write this on a dare?,"I think somebody must have dared her to use as many brand name products as possible. I've got nothing against using mixes, but she takes it to extremes - in less time than it takes to thaw Cool Whip, you can toss cream and sugar into a mixer and have real whipped cream; if you have a stand mixer, you don't even have to pay much attention to it. And if you don't have a stand mixer, you should - that's something that really saves time and money. If you make desserts often, ""from scratch"" (generally just sugar, eggs, and flavoring) is cheaper than Cool Whip and frosting cans, even when you include the cost of the mixer.Save your money - look on the sides of your cake mixes, they generally have ideas just as good as hers."
1,Do Not Waste Your Time or Money,"What a pointless book! It is clearly nothing more than a marketing ploy. After all, why make something using expensive, bland pre-fab ingredients that will not save you any time and are expensive. In most instances cooking from scratch will at worst take no longer, will cost signifigantly less and will contain higher quality ingredients. You have to ask yourself if this woman actually cooks. And then to promote the pollution of the environment by suggesting disposable dinnerware as a matter of course so as to save washing up...? If you want a pre-fab food book, there must be others out there that are better but there are certainly none worse."
5,"Surprisingly durable, good value",I needed this sifter to speed up the gold-panning process when we go out and have some fun on the river. The sifter is light-weight and more durable than I thought. It does the trick.
5,ShakeNBake,I love this product!. It makes cooking chicken so easy and you don't have to watch it: 45 minutes in the oven and you're done!!. Experiment with added ingredients.
2,Shake it before you bake it,"If you do it in reverse (bake before shaking), you're going to get a mess. The parmesan just won't stick and it will be extra gritty.If you want good chicken, make sure you follow the prescribed order:1) Shake2) Then bakeThen you're going to have some of the finest chicken known to man.Shake 'n Bake Baby!"
3,New-Age Feminist Babble,"Obviously, a textbook about the psychology of women would be geared toward the political hot-button issues that affect women, and ""solutions"" that they think most women would like. While the politics is there and obvious (and rehashing of the usual arguments), the gender-theory and embryology aspects are well-explained and keep it interesting and informative...with a grain of salt."
2,"Looked nice, but after one month globe shattered and broke my sink","We had purchased this and installed it about one month ago. Today we heard a loud crash. One of the globes had shattered into our sink, cracking the sink which will need to be replaced. We own many light fixtures that involve a globe being held in by screws and have never had a problem before. Inspection of the fixture shows that all the screws are still holding the ring of the glass as should be, so we ruled out installation error. The globe seems to have simply shattered and fallen. This isn't the cheapest fixture to begin with, so I would expect significantly better quality. Now I'm out a sink on top of the cost of this fixture, which I'm hesitant to leave installed after the sink is replaced, as I'll continually fear the day when the second globe will drop. Quite disappointed."
4,"great light, love it",love the look and after we install the light...love how bright it light up my bathroom...I even took out the ceiling light becasue this vanity light is good enough for a 8x11 room...
5,This was the prefect item for my new bathroom,"The lights are absolutely beautiful and not too expensive. I looked everywhere for the perfect light for over the mirror in my bathroom and this light is so fantastic. The nice thing about this fixture is that is does not hang down too low and the light is bright, putting on make-up is really prefect. I am happy every time I go into my new bathroom."
1,This is for crazy people,"If your a right wing Born again christian, then this would be the book for you, if you can even understand it!!I found it rather Scary.."
4,Great to work on form!,"I orinally started out with this disc in DX plactic in the one fifty class. Now anyone that has ever thrown DX knows that if your going to use it more then a few times, its going to get pretty chewed up. I quite quickly upgraded to champion plastic, but was faced with a choice, stay with my 150 that I was throwing so well with, or upgrade to around a 170. I decided to stick with the 150, and man am I glad I did. I really perfected my form with this disc, its light enough that you don't have to huck it down the course, meaning you can get your grip, stance, and throwing technique down before having to work on your power, which should be worked on after you become aware of what you're doing. My friends used to laugh at me for throwing a 150, but guess whos got their technique down and beating them by 2 or 3 strokes on 18? Great started disc, highly recomended!"
2,Don't buy TRUC46 if you use a laptop with a Wireless Card,"When I bought this phone I had to decide between TRUC46 and Plantronics CT10. I decided for the Uniden because it looked nicer, lighter and the 2.4GHz is newer technology. Well, the problem is that this is the same frequency used by the 802.11 Wireless Cards. So, to make it simple, if you have a laptop with a Wireless Card (or intend to have one) do not buy 2.4GHz technology phones. Keep using the 900Mhz stuff.BTW, I called Uniden and they confirmed this story and told me there is nothing that could be done. I wish I had seen an warning anywhere."
1,Great phone except jack connector shorted out in 3 months.,No complaints about the phone except that it's now useless after 3 months because of poor engineering with the headset jack. The jack appears to have 'shorted out' or lost a contact with the electronics so the headset goes dead (regardless of what headset used) and only intermittently works.Rated 1 star for poor durability under NORMAL use (was never dropped or abused). All the features in the world are useless if it doesn't work!
1,2 phones in a row didn't work!,I have purchased 2 Uniden Tru 46 phones that have not worked. It has taken an incredible amount of time to test and straighten out the situation. All I want is a phone that works! I don't have time to keep exchanging products.
3,The sacrifice is battery life . . . and a headset,"I am revising my review downward due to one of the headsets, which has given out after three weeks!No issues with sound quality, very small, mute button is a nice feature, etc. However, I was on conference calls for six straight hours today, and it finally gave out at the end of the sixth hour. Switched back to my old phone for the rest of the day."
2,Jack problem again,"This was a great product, but my jack also shorted out. The device is useless now."
1,not as advertised -- not the TRUC46,"This is a TRUC56 phone which does not come with 2 headsets and the one headset that it comes with is not adjustable like the TRUC46 phone. I ordered this from Amazon and sent it back immediately with this explanation. I can't believe that this is still marketed on this website the wrong way. However, the return process was very easy through Amazon. I have the TRUC46 phone and it's great!"
1,Faulty connection with headset,"I read all the glowing reviews and went with Uniden instead of Plantronics. What a mistake. First of all, I thought the phone would be much bigger...the main reason for not picking the Plantronics.The bigger issue is that I have used the phone for under three months and the connection between the phone and the headset has become loose. My phone conversations got very static filled at first and now the phone just cuts in and out!! I am so disappointed.To make matters worse, their warranty requires you to UPS the phone in yourself and then wait for it to be repaired and sent back...unless you want to pay ..., and receive a ""like new"" phone in return. You still pay for the original phone to be sent back.I wish I had listened to my brother who has a Plantronic and loves it. I would recommend you do the same!"
3,Good for the most part,Great head phones but no 3.5mm adapter? HmmThey fit my ears great and sound goodotherwise.
5,BRAIN AND CORE TECHNOLOGY,"Among the increasing publications of books in Management, ""Technoleverage"" emerges as a help-full handbook for the year 2000. It provides guidelines for top managers willing to create change, understand where their company is, where to go, and how. In an original approach the author unveils methods and describes the processes in a realistic way. How to identify opportunities, produce brand-new ideas, differenciate and implement in a cost effective manner. How to deliver value to customers and stay ahead from competitors, how to measure your company's success.... With a clear vision, the autor shows the way to run business."
5,A Helpful Guide,Coontz' book is a helpful guide to all the changes marriage has undergone over the centuries. Anyone who believes the institution has been static will have to change his/her mind given the level of detail the author shares. This is a well researched book and readable to boot.
1,worthless,"Stephanie Coontz, ""scholar"" at prestigious Evergreen State College, has delivered yet one more broadside against reason and intellectual honesty. One need not spend time dismantling the arguments of those who find her work fair and balanced - propagandists have always had their supporters. Suffice it to say that this is characteristic of what passes for ""scholarship"" at today's college, which is to say, it is simply awful. Coontz relies entirely on whatever meager evidence she can muster supporting her premise, while totally ignoring any and all evidence to the contrary. In this case, that contrary evidence is massively overwhelming - but no matter - the end justifies the means. Tripe."
4,Well thought out,"Ms. Coontz has written a well-researched work of far-ranging scope. A very good read, especially the last one hundred years in the U.S."
5,Extremely well researched and insightful,"After my second divorce, I read perhaps a hundred or more books and thousands of articles, researching human relationships, trying to understand why marriage is so difficult to sustain. I did so with the intention of eventually writing a book on the subject. I sincerely hope I can produce a manuscript that approaches the quality of this book by Stephanie Coontz. From an academic standpoint, her book is exhaustively researched and well documented. It is valuable as a reference work. From a personal standpoint, it leaves me with a much better understanding of myself and my two marriages and divorces. I will be a better person for having read it. From a literature standpoint, it is well written, entertaining, and engaging. I plan to give copies of it to friends as gifts."
2,crappy quality.,"I bought these duckbill pliers mainly to remove hose clamps. these pliers were good for the first two months, after-which, the teeth were gone and they wouldn't grip anything. Lesson learned, I will never buy cheap tools ever again. I would gladly spend three times as much, if it meant, I would have a tool that would last a lifetime."
5,Another Great CD from Terri!,"This is another great album that Terri has released, perhaps her best one yet!! I recommend it to everyone, whether you are a Country buff or not, it's great for all types of music fans!!"
4,Discount priced.,"Have used this photo paper for years now, I happened to be discounted and I can use it as needed withoutloss. Good quality large prints."
3,Pen still available from Leap Frog,Since these appear to be discontinued... You can get a replacement stylus (pen) from Leap Frog for free (+$5 shipping) by calling them at 800-701-5327. We did this. It was pretty easy to replace and works fine.
4,Great kit.,"The kit is made of quality materials. The installation was fairly easy.I wish it would have come with heavier duty tie-wraps and a method for mounting the quick connect to the vehicle other than a bolt/screw. Other than that, I have no complaints."
4,"Good product, does the job.","I used this kit to run battery power to my winch that mounts on a custom plate into my trailer hitch receiver. I thought it to be a little pricey but didn't want to be bothered crimping ends on my own wire, having to buy the crimping tool etc. Has been working fine so far."
1,"No Japanese, False Advertising by Amazon",The DVD was advertized as having Japanese. No Japanese anywhere possible with it and was the only reason I bought it. Be warned when it comes to Amazon's listings of DVD's having Japanese. A LOT of these are incorrect!
5,Wolverine got his (...)kicked by a non-mutant,"I never really got into the Punisher comics, and Wolverine was cool so I got this and laught threw the Graphic Novel. I mean first some stupid reporter wantes a story for the Punisher, hand coughs himself to the Punisher gets shot, runs some guy over, and falls in to a woodchipper,for a stupid story.Then the Punisher faces off with Wolverine. Wolverine get shot in the face,his antimanium skull hanging out, shot in the balls, and driven over with a steam roller.Thanks to the Punisher.You should diffently get this fr your collation"
4,"Wolverine finally gets what he deserves; Thanks, Frank!","... The book is worth cover price just to see Frank park the steamroller on top of Wolverine, the most overrated, overexposed, unconvincing ""tough-guy"" in all comics. Not to mention the bonus of having ""the old canuucklehead"" shot in the face, and walk around for most of the story with his adamantium skull hanging out in the open. For X-haters, this tale is an instant classic. The irony of all this is that by the late eighties, I felt just as annoyed by the Punisher himself as I am today by Wolverine and his Clint Eastwood posturing."
4,Wolverine gets what he deserves,"The issues collected here are much better than the ones found in the previous volume, Army of One, as we see former Preacher and Hellblazer scribe Garth Ennis get a little bit more comfortable as he throws us some of the bizarre and insanely dark humor that he is known for. There's much to admire, from a reporter handcuffing himself to Frank to get a story, to Frank taking a trip to Ireland; but the real highlight is the two issue arc in which the overly too popular X-Men member Wolverine gets his claw popping arse handed to him. Darick Robertson (who struck gold with Ennis on the Fury and Born mini-series) supplies the pencils on those two issues, and his art is just plain awesome. The only problem with Business as Usual is the constraints of the PG+ rating don't allow Ennis to get into the over the top bloodbath that he writes so meticulously, but other than that, this is one of the best Marvel Knights Punisher volumes available."
2,Shipping is what brought this down to 2 stars,"I was charged just as much for shipping as what the product cost! Over $12 for this small box of coconut creme powder! I love the product, it tastes rich and wonderful, but I'll find it elsewhere for less than that..."
1,Two Words: UBER TERRIBLE,"Ok, I am dissapointed in Terry Brooks and Christopher Paolini for giving this book any kind of Blurb. This book had everything going wrong. Plot line was nothing original, the execution of the plot was just horrible. To disjointed, and used too many bad literary tricks like the constant jump in narrative. Their was no cohesion. It seemed like a Cliff Notes version of the book. No real dialogue, no real description, the book just jumped along. It really did seem like a book a shortcutting teenager would write. Very Bad Read in my opinion"
4,Decent First book,"Its a good start. It does what a book is supposed to do, keep you entertained and entranced until you finish the end. The only thing is the ending seems rushed and there wasn't much development of the background of the story and of some of the characters."
2,Good story poorly written,"It's apparent that this was written by someone with limited writing experience. It's a good story, but it's written poorly. I could hardly enjoy reading it as I couldn't get past the structure of it. Great for pre-teens though, not as well written as Eragon or Harry Potter series."
4,Not exactly what you'd expect but still worthwhile.,"The songs by Smokey Robinson, The Temptations, Barbara Mason and Lenny Williams most certainly don't belong on a rare oldies CD as they were all big R&B hits and are readily available elsewhere. The rare and obscure songs by The Ballads, Billy and The Bloodknots, Freedom Machine, GQ, The Village Choir and Carl Carlton are your real reasons for buying this CD."
3,Movie Poster Gifts,Posters were a gift and they were well received. Would recommend them to any one enjoying movies. 3 more words!
2,"dare not recommend it a ""buy""","The core concepts of the nine you know who, as summarized by the author, are: 1) diversify your portfolio 2) be cost conscious 3) start investing now and stay invested 4) keep your emotions in check 5) take an active, involved role in investment even if you got an advisor.Not that insightful, right? You know these ideas quite well but just fail to execute them profitably, dont you? Now you may see why I dare not recommend it a ""buy"".p.s. The best I can get is from Samuelson:- ""You should take money seriously. In fact, you shouldnt enjoy investing. That's a trap. It makes you too active. You churn your own portfolio. You listen to stories, and most of the stories are not worth listening to."""
2,To much music,Overall the CD was okay. I expected the CD to be him singing but no. All it is is the background music so I was a little dissapointed! I wouldn't recomend this CD but I do recomend Toby Keith Greatest Hits 2!
1,not what i expected,"The book is beautifully presented but, this is not the book for someone looking to get ideas for a back yard pond. If you are looking for something more elegant for focal point for your home, such as a waterfall or reflexion pond, then you might get some ideas."
3,"Good buying experience, but less information is provided !","I have had a good experience with the seller. However, the product information including item images were not comprehensive nor sufficient. Perhaps the seller should consider this issue because some customers may not get what they want from 4 or 5 lines of specification summary."
2,very slow,I own a 256mb cruzer mini and I just bought the 2 gbI tried recording the same file on both drives and it takes 5 times more on the 2 gb than on the 256...I'm very disapointed...
5,Its ok,"I dont know why people are complaining about it, it worked pretty good for me and I have it for over a year now. Its a life saver as per me."
3,Too Expensive For a 2 GB Version,"Although a good (maybe even great product), the price on Amazon is ridiculously high. I'm sorry I ever made this purchase. A realistic price should be in the $20 - $30 range (as of December 2006)"
5,MIni Flash Drive,The one I ordered was factory sealed and DOA. I contacted San Disk and they sent out a brand new one. I marvel at all that memory on such a tiny device. It's amazing.
1,SanDisk Cruzer Mini 2 GB USB Flash Drive Review,It would not download; it just stopped about 1/4 the way through. I will have to send it back.
2,00000000.000 Issue,"I have this error any times when I use this pen drive, I like to solve this issue because it did not work properly.This error create folders with 00000000.000 and you can not delete these files and lose your work. Only if you format the pen dirve you can solve this problem."
1,"PRODUCTS CAME IN A ZIPLOCK BAG, NOT SEALED BOTTLES.","HERBAL GARDENS DID NOT STATE THAT THEIR PRODUCTS ARE NOT CONTAINED IN SEALED BOTTLES. THEREFORE, WHEN I RECEIVED PKG AND SAW THAT EACH ITEM ORDERED WAS IN A CLEAR ZIPLOCK BAG I WAS HIGHLY UPSET AND DISAPPOINTED. HOW DO I KNOW HOW SAFE THE PRODUCT IS FROM DAMPERING WITH. THIS IS NOT A SAFE WAY TO BUY HERBAL PRODUCTS. IF HE HAD LISTED THAT ITEMS WOULD BE CONTAINED IN ZIP BAGS AND NOT BOTTLES I WOULD HAVE PURCHASED SOME PLACE ELSE. WHAT A BIG MISTAKE.THE COMFREY CAPSULES ARE IN ZIPLOCK BAG ALSO AND IT APPEARS TO BE ONLY 30 CAPSULES FOR A WHOOPING $10.99 AND THAT IS BEFORE S&H; CHARGE!!!WHAT A RIPOFF!"
3,just okay; there are much better books available,"Nothing special about this book. There are at least a half-dozen better books for begiiner and intermediate pastelists. It is not bad, just not exceptional, either."
4,Works great,We use this ladder on a lake dock with mostly children using it. I would prefer the version that rotates out of the water when not in use.
4,pretty freaky,this is a well done soundtrack...my only complaint about it is that the violin parts can get a bit tedious...but I guess they are really good because I didn't even notice them when I saw the movie...so...overall...very good! ...also a very creepy theme
2,Out of date,"While the first aid portion of the book is very good, all of the CPR information is out of date and does not reflect the standards adopted in 2005. This includes the standards for adult, child, and infant CPR; child and infant rescue breathing, and unconscious choking for adult and child."
3,Needs Update,The book has much of what you expect in a first aid book. The one problem is that the book hasn't been updated in a long time. One of the treatments recommended was outdated and wrong.
4,The American Red Cross FIrst Aid and Safety Handbook,"I just needed it for referencing certain items for an exam that I needed to take, which I passed, thank you!"
3,"Old, but still helpful","This book is a comprehensive treatment of most first aid procedures. It has some visuals; and what there is there is well done. However, with a 1992 publication date, the information on CPR and CPR-related procedures are dated and not very helpful. As a volunteer with the Red Cross; however, this book is a nice addition to my emergency kit. I would recommend it for anyone."
4,Quick look,A simple but reflective look at the monastic year. Br. Latourrettehas written several worthwhile books this among them. He's an interesting man.
4,Sylvian is Ambient again,"This is a welcome return of the Ambient David Sylvian of the late 80s, which included two excellent collaborations with ex-Can bassist Holger Czukay. The three tracks here paint vast landscapes and create beautiful atmospheres for those who are ready to challenge their ears a little. The two first tracks have previously been released in a limited edition box set, and the 38 minute closing track is recorded for an exhibition with Robert Fripp. The style of the music is similar in feel to some of Brian Enos ambient work, as well as Bill Nelsons Crimsworth, which was also recorded to accompany an exhibition."
3,Not Brian Eno,"This CD is not as good as Brian Eno's Ambient Music for Airports, nor does it sound much like Eno's CD.If you don't have Ambient Music for Airports already, buy it instead."
1,I wished it were Silence,"Comparing this album to the instrumental tracks on ""Gone to Earth"" is a bit of a stretch.""Gone to Earth"" is perhaps my favourite Sylvian album, but ""Approaching Silence"" is nothing like it. It is a rambling ambient composition cut from the same mould as Sylvian's earlier collaborations with Holger Czukay (""Plight and Premonition"" and ""Flux and Mutability""). Consequently, I was just as disappointed with ""Approaching Silence"" as I was with its two ambient predecessors. There are times when I like ambient noise -- just not one hour of it. And I certainly find no need for three albums of it. After about 15 minutes, I wished I were listening *to* silence.This, coming on the heels of the news that Weatherbox would not be re-released after all, was quite a let down.Here's hoping the the next time David decides to get ambient, he balances it with vocals and melody as well as he did in ""Gone to Earth""."
1,One star is too much,"Like nearly everything that Mr. Sylvian has recorded since 1988, this record is terrible. It really makes me wonder what it was that possesed him to create such great music while heading up Japan, and later his solo efforts of the 1980's.It is as if he turned his back on everything, went into some dark diseased jungle, and became at one with the bottom dwellers.A more dissapointing hero there is not. I will pray that someday he comes back to us."
2,NOT TYPICAL MADELINE!,"I was very disappointed after reading Madeline in America. I don't feel this story is in sync with other Madeline stories. The story dwelled on Money. I don't feel little children need to learn about trust funds, inheritance or all the things money can buy. I give the book 2 stars for the other 2 stories in the book that are not Madeline stories, but are quite cute. If you purchase this book, you may want to 'write your own story' to go along with the pictures in Madeline in America. The pictures are Texas scenes, and your children can probably tell a much better adventure story than an inheritance story. I feel obligated to let you know this isn't Typical Madeline so you will be prepared and not disappointed, as I was."
1,The Worst Phone I've Ever Had,"This is the worst phone I have ever had. It cuts out in every room in my house and has been embarrassing to have when dealing with business customers. I have written the seller, but have not received word back for over a week. Uniden will not take it back so it looks like I'm stuck."
2,Disappointing,"I concur with the other reviews about how it LOOKS. It does look very nice and fits into the hand great. However, the range is not twice that of 2.4GHz phones. In fact, I would say that it is worse. I suspect the fact that it has no raised antennaes on the handsets or the base unit contributes to the poor range and sound quality. RADIO DEVICES MUST HAVE ANTENNAES TO RECEIVE/TRANSMIT SIGNALS, UNIDEN!!!One thing to definetely consider is that you cannot use both handsets at the same time!!! This completely nullifies the point of getting a dual handset setup.Batteries...This thing seems to go through a full charge liek crazy, even when it is not in use.I would avoid this product at this time."
1,Had it one year and audio cuts out -- no help from Uniden!,"I've had this expensive system for one year and it is currently not functional. The audio cuts out randomly -- you can sometimes hear very faintly, but usually, not at all. I changed batteries, but the problem is now worse. The ""help"" offered by Uniden was to use only THEIR batteries. SO now I can spend another $30 on more batteries and that doesn't guaruntee that the problem will be solved. Not bloody likely! Crap product, crap service!"
1,The worst phone i ever had!!!!!!,"I bought this phone all excited thinking with 5.8 ghz i could go in the back of my yard and still get great reception. I can't even use this phone in my house!!!! I dial out and hear nothing! I have to press any button just to hear anyone speak after i finish dialing, then within seconds their voice fades out again. I literally had to just hang up on everybody i called because they couldn't even hear me and i couldn't hear them. I was very disappointed with this phone. I got it because my at&t 2.4 ghz phone died and i LOVED that phone. I will never buy another uniden product again, this is the 2nd uniden phone i have purchased and both were useless!"
1,THE WORST CORELESS PHONE I EVER OWNED.,"After paying over $200 (with tax), I found out this is the worst coreless phone in the history. Poor sound quality, poor range, not user friendly.I am totally disappointed with the brand name Uniden, and for all of the people out there, DON'T BUY UNIDEN PRODUCT, ONE OF THE WORST"
1,Great looker but doesn't perform.,"Bought this phone almost based solely on looks. Probably the best looking cordless phone on the market right now. HOWEVER, the range on this phone is HORRIBLE. It is much worse than my 2Ghz phones. I actually found out that the 5Ghz range is probably supposed to be worse than 2Ghz since that's what I found out while I was setting up the wireless network in our house. If I lived in an apartment then maybe, a BIG MAYBE, I'd keep this phone, but otherwise just stick to the 2Ghz phones for now."
1,Bad Reception,For all the hype...I had much better reception with my older 900 Mghz and 2.4 Mghz phones. The static was horrible and my 2.4 carried the reception over much longer distances.
2,Disappointing overall,"The sound quality was not what I expected for a phone with 5.8 technology. People have asked me if I was on my cell phone while using this phone. The quality was very hollow sounding. The handsets do not rest well on their bases and wobbles. The feature that I was excited about was the speakerphone feature on the handset. When I tested it, the person on the other end could not hear me very well even when the phone was only a foot away."
1,Answering Machine???,Why do thes manufacturers all think that everyone wants an answering machine with their phones. I am sure that a lot of people like myself have voice mail with the phone company and do not need or want an answering machine with their phones.
1,5.8 Giggle,"I bought this phone about a week ago and was totally dissatisfied with it. The main reason was its reception. Too much static even when close to the base. I get better reception on my cell phone. People couldnt hear me talk on the speakerphone or headset. The box says its a 5.8 but functions like a .05mhz. I dont recommend this product. I ended up exchanging it for the Panasonic 2.4 Expandable which im very happy with. No static, sleek style, speakerphone, caller ID, expandable up to 8 headsets, now im finally satisfied!!!!"
2,Could be better.,"I bought this phone thinking it would be the cutting edge of phone technology. Wrong! First of all, the range of this phone from the base unit is less then my 900mhz phone was! Both handsets CANNOT listen to the same phone call?!?!And, speed dials, distinctive rings etc. must be programmed twice! Once in EACH handset! The price is not worth it for this phone. Take my advice and get a Panasonic 2.4 Ghz phone. You'll be glad you did!"
3,Phone that could use some improvement,"This phone has some decent/neat features - Dual keypads, Speakerphone on base and handset, light on handset to indicate there is a new message, battery life is decent. However there are several annoying features on the implementation and/or not on phone - to transfer a call from speaker to headset (even the same handset) you must put the person on hold then pickup or you will disconnect the line, this phone cannot have more than 2 headset (not an issue in my case), the phone list cannot be transferred from 1 phone to the other, cannot conference using two handsets, the earpiece is actually the exposed speaker, the range isn't any better (actually a little worse) than 2.4 ghz phones although a little louder/clearer than Siemens 4215 (and much better battery life."
1,Don't BUY it,"i rarely ever submit reviews....but this phone is really bad...for being such a technologically advanced phone and cool looking, i expected it to sound good.......instead, i got static/noise.........i had panasonics before.....and should've never trusted any other brand.............especially, a Uniden...and what's this......the two handsets can't share a call?....you can only transfer it......and to make it worse....you have to program the phone numbers separately into each handset.....quite tedious......the siemans, which i also bought and tried....is also terrible.......at least, the siemans allows you to share stored phone numbers............buy panasonic..........."
4,Very pleased so far,"Read the reviews on here and bought this phone set. It's very nice looking. Controls work well. One of our favorite features is the remote handsets have blinking lights if messages exist on the answering machine. Sounds silly, but nice to not have to always walk into our home office to check the machine. Much easier to just look across the family room.Several reviews (including Amazons) indicate you can expand this set w/ additional handsets. We have not tried this, but Uniden's sales and support staff have both told me personally that this is not possible. If it works, great...but I've heard nothing factual that would indicate this yet and don't plan to go buy another phone to test it out.Other nice features include speakerphones in the handsets and different ring styles and volumes. Also, I do think the machine's voice incoming & outgoing recording is acceptable. All in all, it's the nicest phone combo set we've ever owned.*Only owned for one week, but so far so good."
2,Not Worth the Price,"I bought this to replace an old 2.4 GHz phone. The sound quality was OK but was actually worse than the 2.4 GHz. I was expecting much more for the price. The features are generally good, but the most annoying thing is that only one handset can be active at a time. When talking on one handset, the other handset will NOT operate.In the end, I returned this phone and got a Panasonic 2.4 GHz that sounds great, was cheaper, has 3 handsets, and more features."
2,Beautiful Phone - Terrible reception,"Yes, you will be tempted to buy this phone because of its looks, and because it is cheaper than the Panasonic 5.8Ghz phone.However, I couldn't go more than 10 feet out of my house without the call breaking up. Even inside, right next to the base, there is a slight, but noticable white-noise hum in the background of every call. I should note that I tried this phone at my office, and at home with the same results.The other problem, as other reviews note, is that you can only use 1 handset at a time. I exchanged this phone for the Panasonic 51xx series. I am now satified. There is no comparison, as far as reception goes."
2,Your Mileage May Vary,"While I was satisfied with the audio quality of the phone, the range was actually much worse than my older 2.4 GHz or 900 MHz phones. Worse, the Uniden would cut in and out when I neared the end of my indoor range, meaning I would actually lose parts of the conversation. My Panasonic 2.4GHz just clicks a bit when I'm near the end of the range. The Uniden could not cover the length of my large two-bedroom apartment. Frankly, I expected a lot more from this phone."
1,Severe limitations....,"Limitation #1: A maximum of two handsets for the entire system. Limitation #2: only one handset can be in use at a time. If someone calls in and two people want to talk, forget it with the UNIDEN TRU5885-2 system. Poor design compared to others on the market. Limitation #3:The preprogrammed phone numbers have to be programmed into each handset separately and the Caller Id Numbers have to be cleared on each handset individually.On the positive side it has the best backlight display of any phone available, uses NIMH batteries.The limitations were to great, so I returned the telephone."
4,"Great phone, would give 4.5 stars if possible","I had to buy this phone because I'm a gadget guy and need all the new stuff. I had a Siemens 2.4 GHz set similar to this, but was experiencing HEAVY interferance with my wireless computer network. I ended up getting this one over the Vtech based on bad reviews, and honestly this one just looks a heck of a lot better. The one and only complaint I have is a benefit as well (with roommates as mentioned above), but for my family, it was nice to put the Name and Numbers in one phone and have it show up on both, delete caller ID from one, and have it deleted from both. This one is completely seperate from each other. To each their own. Other than that, the sound is exceptional. I love the speakerphone built into each handset and the base. Great for the long waits on the phone with businesses. Also, no interference with my 802.11b network (the next gen wireless 802.11a is on 5.8Ghz, so beware!) Now all they need is downloadable ring tones for this. Very happy."
2,Disappointment,"Wow, what a disappointment. I bought this set for my son, and not knowing what ""1/35"" really meant when it came to size, I opened the box to find these teeny tiny pieces of plastic. The picture used for this item seems so elaborate. I had the impression that these pieces were the size of 'action figures' sold in the store -- perhaps the size to be held between thumb and index finger.There was no glue, nor paint included in the box. I am sure this was disclosed somewhere in the description online, but I did not see it when I ordered this set.Probably why the price was so low.What a shame. I probably will not even give this to my son after all. He cannot even play with the set as is, since the arms, legs, torsos, etc. are all in pieces."
4,174903 exhaust system,"Easy install. Good price for a cat-back system. Has nice growl but nothing over the top. For the price i really cant ask for more. The product description is wrong but the features and notes are correct on the amazon page. Only thing Ive noticed after several months is it is starting to rust, im up in miane so theres alot of salt on the road."
3,Overpriced,"This item is hugely overpriced. It is an Indian edition with an MSRP of 1.5 rupees which is less than 5 cents. If I was not desperate to get this book in this country, I would not have paid that amount."
5,Excellent,The book arrived in perfect condition. I'm very happy with the merchant.Marilyn HuebnerSyd Field is an excellent teacher. I'm at Ringling School of Art in Sarasota. I found his foresight to be most helpful in identifying and asking the rights questions to correct the problem.
1,Cookie Cutter Movie Scripts,"Ever wonder why so many movies are exactly the same. Blame this guy, he has his formula and every script needs to follow it or it is no good. I don't think so. The irony of this book is that the films he admires the most are the ones that don't follow his writing formula. The other thing that bothers me, is the book is all about drama's. There is little or nothing on action, sci-fi, comedy, westerns, animation. There are so few insights that I really felt this book was really more about the writers ego and the 'look how great I am' attitude than providing the real nuts and bolts that an aspiring film writer needs to know. I threw away his formula and guess what? See you at the movies!"
3,Repetitive/Informitive,"It teaches you the structure and how knowing the structure can help you solve your problem. I think it should be taken a step further to show you how you can know the structure to make an alternative. But overall, while not necessarily a writer's block book, will teach you some interesting ideas if you common folk get thsi imaginary disease."
2,"Repetitive, boring","How useful is it to have extremely vague and rambling prose accompanied by already fixed examples? Answer: not useful at all. If Sid wants us to learn, he has to show us flawed scripts, then what happens when he fixes them. I personally found this book full of lame advice, describing problems only complete fools would run into. Maybe that is the point. The two things I salvaged from this book are: a) Do an outline of your screenplay first, then write around that. NEVER start writing from scratch, no matter how bold an approach it seems. b) Put lots of action in your screenplay, avoid dialogue driven plays. Think Dogma. Apart from that, I liked how Sid harped on cruddy movies like Die Hard 3 and Broken Arrow... but he never shows us how or where they break down... he only says that they do. Now that you have read my review, you got all the good stuff from the book, so I just saved you money. Buy his earlier books, this just seems like it was written solely to make a quick buck."
4,Answered my questions,"Admittedly, I already had a feeling for what was wrong with my first screenplay, but this book helped me identify what to DO about it. After reading two chapters, I reorganized my material and turned a bore into a page turner!"
4,Clint returns to his original style,"I am enjoying this CD. It's much closer to his original style, which is what drew me to Clint Black in the first place."
5,My Fifth Cd From Mr. Castro,I would like to start of by saying I did not know who Christian Castro Was untill 1999 when I heard the song Mi Vida Sin Tu Amor and got the cd for Christmas. Now this if my 5th cd from Christian. I got Christian's new cd for the song Te Buscaria. When I frist heard the song I was ready to drop on the floor. I had never heard such a betiful song such as Te Buscaria. But thats not the only song that I like. I think the whole cd is very nice. Christian's last cd was good but it was not the best in the world. I think this one is better. There is a piture of Christian and his wife on the inside back cover. I satrt my collection off with Christian's 1997 cd and up. And I think the best I have heard is His 1997 cd but this is a very nice cd also. If you are a Christian Castro fan you should buy it.
4,Nero Wolfe - The Complete Second Season,I received the first season for a Christmas gift. I liked the show when it was on Television and decided to get it for a personal birthday gift. I enjoy the show for its use of color as well as the stories roughly follow the Nero Wolfe books. The is an item which I would only recommend to someone with the interest in the books. Nero Wolfe is a different type of detective.
5,Love It,"Wonderful music and zikr sing along! We listen to this CD often as we travel, it is always one of six CDs in my player."
5,Excellent book. Maybe the best of his kind.,"I found out about this book three days ago, and I just couldn't believe it. Previously the only book worth reading about the subject (seven types of human essence according to Gurdjieff's system) was Friedlander's, and even so, it was seriously incomplete, although his description of the types was quite detailed and the book made for entertaining reading. This books includes a great wealth of information never before (I think) constructed as an integral whole. If you are a serious student of the Fourth Way system it is undoubtedly a very useful book. Congratulations to Susan Zannos for an extraordinary book. (If this book is translated to Spanish and sold in Mexico there is a lot of people that will find it very interesting.) Written by: a Lunar Intellectual (you'll have to read the book to find out what this means ) :-) ABC."
1,More of this error? Oh no1,"The Enneagram is just not about human types. This is an error introduced from jolly California. The diagram is about the cosmos, about the two great laws that created and sustain the Universe. It was never a tool for typology. Get this straight, dear seekers."
2,not what I ordered,I ordered what is shown on the picture. I received a flat rubber key chain with a mean look to it. Not a cute ball and glove
2,the cool tin case doesn't even make this worth it,"I thought I was getting something ""cool"" when I found this one. The front gleefully says ""an uncensored biography"" and ""the full story with interviews"".For one. There's just this guy reading information about Nine Inch Nails. No surprise there and nothing new and noteworthy either. Well, there is one surprise. . . there's this somewhat cheesy music that plays on the even numbered tracks (between the narration tracks) that is almost a parody on Nine Inch Nails.For two. The ONE interview (not interviews like the cover says) is the exact same interview as the first one that appears on the interview cd called ""Disturbed"". What a rip off.Oh, and don't get suckered in by the somewhat cool looking metal ""limited edition packaging"". It's definitely not worth it."
1,Nice Price,First of all I found this cd in an audio store for... second it sucks I use the special case for other cds. It is really boring and truthfull doesnt tell you much about trent reznore in whole.
5,Always great,I am never disappointed with this series. This is just another great one in a series of great tv shows.
2,impractical,"There were a couple cute ideas in this book, but overall I found it dated looking and very impractical. You can find a lot of better ideas online, for free. If you're going to invite 15 people to your wedding and hand-deliver the invitations then you should get this book. Am I going to send my invitations on wine bottles or with a sewn zipper? Not likely. The amount of time to create these is ridiculous and the mailing would be prohibitively expensive or impossible. I thought it funny that the authors include a note about how you shouldn't devote your existence to ephemeral invitations that most people are going to discard . . . and then tell you to spend half an hour crafting a pop-up bride in a can invite that will cost you $6 to mail.I think a lot of these invites are better suited to small parties."
4,Helpful,"This is a nice book. However, it would have been even better if there were more invitation styles included in the book."
1,Wedding Invitations,"This book was not very informative. If you have a good eye for decorating and a minimum of taste, this book was a waste of time. It's feeled with very limited ideas. The book is a rip-off. Don't waste your money buying it. I would send it back, but the postage alone, cost more than the purchase."
3,Must be crafty,I have found that I am obviously not very crafty. The book tries to lay out the details on how to make the invitations for those of us that are crafty challenged. I decided that there was to much work involved with making your own invitations. There are very nice designs in the book for those people that are willing to put the time and effort into making the invitations.
2,Not Worth Buyng,"We purchased a few wedding craft books from Amazon, and this was definitely our least favorite. There aren't many practical projects to make, and nothing in the book really appealled to us at all. Spend your money on something else for your wedding."
5,A very timely independent film,This movie is very touching and heartfelt to watch. In a very respectful way the families of these fallen service men tell their agonizing stories of the aparent inability of the army to tell the whole story of their deaths due to friendly fire incidents. The film is an absolute must see.
2,Look for something else to learn Computer Vision,"This book was very confusing even for a first year grad student like me...it is not a good book to learn Computer Vision from the beginning. I had to turn to other texts to better understand the material. I was highly disappointed that my professor chose this text for first year grad class in Computer Vision. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this book. There are other books out there that are so much better to learn Computer Vision."
1,don't buy this book,"this book sucks! terms are often inconsistent and expressions always unclear. Many simple concepts are written in very complicated ways. Perhaps this is because the author want this book to look more ""academic"". Don't buy this book unless you are already an expert in this area"
1,Complete mess,"I am a current PhD student working on computer vision. I feel it is a shame that, one of the most famous books for one of the most popular areas in computer science is a total mess. The authors do not know what it means for a textbook. Do not buy it! ""Multiple View Geometry"" is a nice book. For application-oriented vision problems, I suggest readers look at recent papers published at CVPR, ICCV, PAMI, etc."
3,Somewhat opaque,"Good point: probably most recent vision bookBad point: hard to read, missing obvious computer vision topics"
1,"Terrible book, Hard to understand!","It is hard for me, as a Ph.D. graduate student to understand this book. The content is not well organized and many terms are not defined before using.Not recommend for any person."
1,Too many jargons to understand.,"The Authors used too many technical words without definition, and beautified each sentence by using complicated structures. Because of that, it took so much time to read and understand than any other similar books."
1,Not a good book to begin with,The book fails to explain simple concepts in a clear way. Trying other literature such as 'Shapiro and Stockman's' book is enough to convince yourself that the same concepts can be explained clearly without losing insight.
1,"hard to understand, definitely not for beginners","Lots of math, lots of theory, only a small chapter at the end with some applications. I wish the authors had more clearly explained the motivations for using a particular approach. It looks like a bunch of theories... Not usable."
5,Great book to grasp the foundations of modern CV,"This book is a great resource for CV researchers and graduate students who need to understand the foundations of the modern computer vision. One has to be familiar with the contents of this book to understand the state-of-the-art research reported in journal articles. This book does a great job by introducing the exact amount of information needed, not more not less.This level of sophistication, of course, requires good understanding of mathematical and statistical concepts as well as working knowledge of basic image processing. This might not be a book for a beginner in CV but if you want to do serious work in CV, this is definitely the book you'll need to read at some point. Congrats to the author."
3,HIT AND MISS,"SOME TIMES IT SHARPENED BITS AND SOMETIMES IT DID NOT. DO NOT EXPECT THE BITS TO WORK VERY WELL ON METAL, OKAY FOR WOOD PROJECTS. SMALL BITS REALLY DO NOT SHARPEN. A BIT CAN BE SHARPENED ABOUT THREE TIMES, SO IT DOES BEAT GOING TO THE STORE OVER AND OVER."
2,Hard to use,"The ""brush"" part is shaped like an ""h"" so that if you were to fit in in the babies mouth around their teeth it would fit something like a mouth gaurd and then you'd have to slide it over the teeth back and forth for the brushes to hit the surfaces. I would think it would be much more useful if the end with the bristles was flat with bristles on both sides. We had an easier time with a toddler brush than with this thing.adding this later....while it hasn't been a great toothbrush it's been useful for teething for my toddler."
3,MEI YONG GUO,ZAN SHI BU ZHI DAO ZEN ME PING JIA TAYIN WEI MEI YONG GUODAN GU JI BABY BU HUI XI HUANYIN WEI MEI WEI DAOKOU GAN YE PU TONG
3,Great Soothing Teether as well,These work great as a soother than a tooth brush. Its not that simple to brush a 6 months old mouth because the end piece is quite large for a babys mouth. I can see it used as a toothbrush but it doesnt look very effective for the baby since you cant really move it side to side to help gently scrub the baby's tooth
4,My 20 month old likes this,"I have trouble with my 20 month old letting me brush his top front teeth. With this it makes it easier. He holds onto it and i hold it over his hand and brush his teeth.Pros- bristles that clean all around, handlecons-a bit small"
4,Nice product but toddler likes it too much,My 1 year old loves to chew on this so it does help clean the teeth but I cant use it for a toothbrush because he wont let go of it. So I let him have this to play with and use a finger toothbrush for more formal brushing.
3,"Soft, easy to grab tooshbrush, but not too effective","Our 14months old daughter loves to chew on this toothbrush, and has been using it twice a day, for a month now. The material is durable and has no damage at all. But our daughter's dentist mentioned that for this type of curved toothbrush to be effective, baby needs to chew on it the right way, teeth fitting inside the narrow curve. Otherwise it's just another teether. We use soft cloth to wash her teeth too, so I guess this product is good for making a habit of brushing/cleaning after meal for baby."
4,she loves it,my teething 6mth loves it but the handle is a bit short. i can tell it bothers her a little so not sure we'll get another one after this but wish i got it sooner.
2,Baby likes it-helps back teeth...but risk of choking-watch out!,"My 10 month old likes this toothbrush/teether but she also likes to chew on the handle part which is thinner than the toothbrush part. If I left her alone with it, I'd be afraid she could choke on it. It's fine if the baby is supervised by an adult while using. I wouldn't use it in place of a pacifier tho."
5,"Finally, we both like brushing teeth!","My son is 15 months old and way past letting me clean his teeth with those finger brushes (he bites hard)! I've been giving him a toddler toothbrush and trying to brush his front teeth is nearly impossible, we wrestle and he cries. Although, he will chew on it for his back teeth.From the moment I gave him this brush, he took to it and spent his whole bathtime chewing on it. He didn't want to give it up! Now he has more teeth coming in, so I'm going to purchase another one for him to chew on during the day."
2,Sorta Pointless...,"My daughter hated having her teeth brushed. I saw this in a catalog for baby safety items and found it cheaper on Amazon. I ordered it, thinking it would be a great choice for my teething baby.This thing is TINY, like as long as my finger. The entire thing is made out of soft sillicone so the handle is a bit pointless - you can't really maneuver it at all. Once the baby bites down on the bristles, you can't move the thing anyway. It would make more sense if this item had a larger handle so baby could hold it and it wouldn't be as easily a choking hazard.I found it pointless - if this was to clean her teeth, well she was cleaning her teeth just as well by sucking on her washcloth in her bath, or chewing on the edge of her blanket. Also, do know you can't pick color. We received pink - I didn't care as that we have a daughter but another may not be happy with lack of color choice."
3,He likes it!..but is it doing anything?,"baby's first tooth brush...not so much. but it is very good for soothing the gums of a teething baby. also keep in mind that this will only work for baby for a limited time as the opening for the gums is pretty narrow. I found that since purchasing this product & writing this review, it has become nothing but a teether."
5,Great item to entertain baby,"The item description as ""Baby's 1st Toothbrush"" is really sort of a misnomer ... this isn't really a toothbrush in the sense that you would actively use it to clean your baby's first sprouting teeth. However, it is more of a chew toy and has unique bristles in it that possibly COULD help clean your baby's teeth / massage their gums as they play with it.Knowing that, this toy is really great. It has a small form factor (about as long as an adult finger), is soft, and of cource the neccessary BPA, lead and phthalate free.It's a perfect little gift for that baby who is starting to teeth or has a sprouted a couple pearly whites already.I also appreciate the fact that the handle has a hole in it, so that i can attach this toy to a tether when my baby's in her stroller."
3,baby enjoys it but size and material could inprove,this toothbrush is great. Baby loves it and it really relieves his itching gums. But it is tiny very tiny it could have a longer handle. and also the materials atracts lint so you have to definatly pay attention while baby is using it. you dont want him to suck on a hairball yuks!. But other than that its great and evryone thinks is cool. Im probably gona buy it again
5,Perfect,"At 9 months my son let me brush his gums for all of about 10 seconds before grabbing this brush out of my hands and doing it himself. Now at a year, we brush our teeth together each night; he brushes his while I'm brushing mine. Good stuff! I love this little toothbrush."
4,Good Product,"I can't tell how well it's actually getting my sons teeth clean, but he absolutely loves this toothbrush. He's 15 months old now, and I will definitely be getting another one for him!"
3,ok,Baby's will chew on either end. im not sure how well it really works to clean the teeth but esp good while teething.
1,Not really sure it is working,We aren't really sure that this is working or not. I think this is more for the concept of brushing teeth more than anything. I have been disappointed.
3,"Pretty Good, Okay.","I wasn't as impressed with this toothbrush as I had hoped. It was fun for my son to chew on but it seemed quite expensive and I thought, ""well maybe it would be really easy and perfect for him when it got here"". well it arrived, and it's tiny! much smaller than I had expected. My son enjoyed chewing on it but it wasn't anything special. I keep losing it because it's so small, truly it's much smaller than expected. I don't know. It was okay, just not what I had hoped for."
2,"It's not horrible, but not great, either.","The truth is, my daughter doesn't really like this product. I have tried to give it to her a few times, and she consistently rejects it. Luckily I bought dental wipes as well, which as far more effective."
5,Great first toothbrush,"Love this toothbrush, and more importantly, my 13 month-old loves it. Before we used a ""normal"" baby-sized, soft bristled, tooth brush and it would turn into a struggle to get all of her teeth brushed. We'd have to resort to holding her arms just to get her teeth clean. Now she wants to brush, reaches for the brush, and even giggles when mom or dad helps out to make sure that all of her teeth are bushed and clean. I wasn't sure that the silicone nubs would scrub the teeth enough to remove food debris and tartar, but they do and baby loves it! I think this is soothing to sensitive and sore gums, whereas the bristled toothbrush was painful. Bought two so far and will purchase again if needed. We bought the first one in clear, and somehow managed to loose it. It's harder than you think to see, and our baby, lacking coordination tends to accidentally fling things. Anyways, bought a pink one and haven't managed to loose it yet so, all it good."
1,Too big for baby's mouth,who was this thing designed for? I was surprised when I received this item and took note of the actual size of the brush. Its way too big for my baby to get into her mouth and so its become a general chew toy that she bites the end of. I really don't see this helping her in any way unless I cut the thing down to half its size. I was fortunate that I bought several different types for her to chews from (pun intended)!
2,The one thing our baby didn't chew on...,"We were disappointed in this product. My baby was 8 months at the time of purchase, liked paci's & chewing on pretty much anything she could get her hands on. She chewed on this 30 seconds & tossed it. I continued to re-introduce it to her over a couple days and she just had no interest. I tried an organic toothpaste she likes on the ""toothbrush"" which helped her chew it for a minute; however, even with guidance, the bristles did not wrap around teeth/gums in order to work properly. For this reason, the ""first toothbrush"" is lucky to get 2 stars. I am sure it helps brush other children's teeth when a child will chew it long enough, otherwise, I recommend just using a washcloth or the finger toothbrush."
1,My son wanted nothing to do with it...,"I bought this product because of the glowing reviews, but my son had zero interest in it. It's a shame, too, because he's had 8 teeth since he was 8 months old and at 11 months I still haven't figured out a way to get them brushed."
3,"Good chew toy, but not toothbrush.",My daughter likes to chew this and it is holding up well but it does not seem to clean her teeth well. It does make a good chew toy but I would recommend brushing your child's teeth with something else in addition to this.
3,-,"They look great...as long as you don't sit em too much. After about a month or so, they started to look rugged and streatch out like an old pair of socks.Overall ==> They give a nice touch to an interior but definitely not meant for everyday driving use."
3,anice print- for summer use only,A very light comfortor for summer use. The 3 pillows/cushions are small and can't be used. The comfortor is a bit smaller than a regular size King comfortors
1,Discontinued for a reason,"I bought two of these radios because Uniden usually has good equipment. Even with a strong radio signal, the alerts would not be set off for this radio -- thereby defeating the purpose of having this. Look for another model."
4,Works in Canon iPF Printers,"This is a good looking luster/glossy roll paper that holds pigment well. If you're going to use it with Canon iPF printers I'd suggest talking with the sales staff where you bought your printer to see if they can develop a custom profile so you don't have to tweak all of your images manually.Nice texture, excellent packaging (wrapped and overlapped in a heavy wax paper that you can re-use if you have to change out rolls) and they don't tape the packaging to the photo paper, so there's little chance of it getting gummed up in the printer or having to trim the edge to ensure it's even.If you've got an Epson printer this is a no-brainer if it's cheap. For Canon I'd only recommend it if you're a printing pro and can create your own profile, or if you have a good relationship with your printer sales/support."
4,it's ok...good for some things,"I've gone through many different papers and this one is better for photographic prints. I guess in it's class of the same finishes I would give it closer to 5 stars. If your intention is closer to ""fine art"" prints such as in my case since I do prints from my original paintings, not of photographs, I would use the somerset velvet papers which look and feel more like watercolor paper. I ended up using this one for testing/proofing. The + for this paper is the colors print a with more vibrancy and contrast then on the velvet, but you can always make tweaks to get the same contrast and vibrancy on the velvet.Using Epson 9800~Susanna Shap[...]"
4,Par,This is my first experience with this author. With his background there is no doubt he has some rather intimate knowledge about what he writes.I found the novel to be fast as well as furious. The writing is what I had a small problem with. It seemed quick and abbreviated with not a great deal of depth. There was certainly no wasted words in this book.A quick and satisfying read just the same.
3,Just Okay,I became a fan of Christopher Dickey after hearing him speak at the Commonwealth Club of San Francisco on NPR. He has amazing depth in Middle Eastern politics and history.With this in mind I read this novel and was very disappointed. I was hoping to read a novel full of Middle-Eastern complexities. This novel is just okay.
5,The Finest Comedy Televison Ever Offered,"It could be said there was no one finer then Lucille Ball - she was ""the"" class act. She changed the way the entire television industry worked. Like all the tapes in this collection, this one is particularly special as it featured Lucy with Harpo Marx. It what was one of televisions finest moments. A must for any Lucy fan and a must for anyone who enjoys great comedy!"
5,Another winner from this Newbery author.,"An unexpected invitation from Aunt Euterpe brings Rosie, Lottie, and Buster Beckett on their way from rural Illinois to Chicago and the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition fair. Of course, they didn't plan on Granddad using Mama's ticket to join them and him bringing along his dog, Tip. Poor Aunt Euterpe, still in mourning after the loss of her elderly husband four years ago, she doesn't know what to do when they arrive and her household staff quits. Soon Granddad has everybody off to the fair, ready to visit the midway attractions including Little Egypt, Lillian Russell, and the Ferris wheel that holds nearly as many people per seat as a boxcar. Aunt Euterpe knows her chances of being part of the Chicago society circle are ruined, even before Granddad takes them to Buffalo Bill's Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders show."
1,Terrible,"This is a terrible book. It has no adventure and is basically about some girl named Rosie that goes to some fair- big woop. It had no adventure at all. I would have given it zero stars but that is not an option. Why it won an award, I have no idea. just read another book instead of this, this is a very very very VERY bad book."
1,Very disappointing.,"""Fair Weather"" sounded interesting from the summary, but it wasn't at all interesting. While reading, I forgot this novel was supposed to be about the World's Fair. The fair wasn't the main topic until nearly the end of the story. I would have stopped reading this book, but as always, I have high hopes and thought it would get better soon, but alas, it didn't. Lottie and Everett seemed out of place and what happened between them was too much of a coincidence and Rosie wasn't a good lead character. If you want to read a book about the Chicago World's Fair, then I suggest ""Exploring the Chicago World's Fair, 1893"" which is apart of the American Sisters series. I do not recommend this book."
1,Fair Days -By:GAIH(grade 5),"It's 1893 in the USA. Rosie Beckett has a pretty regular farm life with her family(that includes her parents, sister and brother, and grandpa). Her life changes when her aunt sends tickets to them to stay at her place for a week. Even more exstatic ,while Rosie is over the Columbian Exposition, a big fair, is in town."
1,Fair Day,"It's 1893. Rosie B. has a pretty regular farm life. She lives with her parents, brother, sister, and grandpa. One day her grandpa comes to their house with a letter from their aunt. Inside is four train tickets and a note. They (her mom, sister, brother, and herself) are invited to the Columbian Expostition in Chicago.My opinion of this novel is ok. I've read better. So if you like climax, this isn't for you."
2,Buyers Beware - condition of book very poor,"This book was purchased for our public library. The book is such poor condition that I can't even use it for our collection. It was library money thrown out the window. I knew that I was purchasing a used book, but for $53.00 I didn't think that it would have so many marks, notes and highlighted sections in the book. Every page had some mark or notation on it which I think would reduce the price of the book but the seller apparently didn't think so. I would not buy from this seller again."
1,Lasted less than 1 minute before it died...,"i wired it up, it worked, so i was going to wire up the light next, nothing worked, then i just did the unit itself again w/o the light, nothing worked...dead in a couple minutes...not the best product in the world..."
5,One of the best!,"To be honest, you shouldn't use anything else but this deodorant. Old Spice has taken their success in lotions to soap and deodorant and have outdone all of their competition. This stuff lasts forever, keeps you dry, and even compliments their soap and lotion products. It's one of two that I'll ever buy because it's really that good."
2,Not a top notch polka album,"The band sounds ok. Not the full richness of a Jimmy Sturr band. The award for Best Polka band, lends a wonder if those who voted for it, really heard the others who sounded much, much better."
4,Short stories for the reader who generally doesn't like short stories,"""Believers"" is Charlie Baxter at the top of his game: totally unassuming grace and a compassion for his characters that makes reading these stories a fulfulling experience.The first story in this collection, ""Kiss Away"", is up there with Joyce Carol Oates's ""Where are You Going, Where Have you Been?"" and Shirley Jackson's ""The Lottery"" on my list of the all-time most haunting short stories which leave the reader feeling vaguely terrified."
3,"Simple yet ,entertaining","One should not ever put the words ""Taj Mahal game"" and ""fascinating"" in the same sentence.This games lacks a lot when compared to other Knizia designs, like AMUN-RE.But the game has a different purpose. It is meant to be a fun, fast and entertaining card-based game for 3-5 people. And it works on that level.Each player visit (or not) 12 provinces in Northwestern India. Each provicne has a number of cities. They fight, by using their cards cleverly, to get Influence Points, by controlling military, religious, economic and social forces (amongst others).Good game, but simply not breathtaking like DOMINANT SPECIES or really engaging like STONE AGE or POWER GRID, or even LANCASTER and SHOGUN."
3,Long Underwear top,"Buying on-line, for someone living many states away is a gamble. I thought that a size Large would be more that sufficient knowing what she wears normally, but I guess that the product was really tight. The woman that I sent it to is going to have to line dry them since she said she's afraid they will shrink. I guess a size Large isn't the same here, as with most shirts and tops. That's a shame. Waste of my money."
5,Love it!!!,I absolutely love this bra! It is very comfortable and does not show under clothes. It arrived on time and fits perfect. I hate to take it off to wash it so I am going to order 2 more. I recommend this bra to any one nursing!!
4,"Comfy, easy to use, doesn't last long enough","I've used these bras for 5 solid years now (no, I'm not nursing a 5 year old--I've had two more since him!). They are the most comfortable, easy to use, all around decent nursing bra I've been able to find. I love the easy to use, secure clips for the nursing flap, and the soft cotton material. That said, you get what you pay for. They don't last real long. I think the support they give is decent at first, but in a year's time it's dramatically decreased. I still use my original bras because most of them haven't become completely unusable (ie actually coming apart), but they don't support much anymore. Do wish they had a bigger cup size--DD fits, but a DDD would be better."
3,Easy to use; hard to conceal,"This is my first experience with a nursing bra so I don't have anything to compare it to. In general, I like the ease of being able to snap and unsnap the closure with one hand and it's pretty comfortable to wear. The major downside is the obscenely wide straps - yes, this makes it comfortable but I'm having a hard time finding shirts that actually conceal the entire strap (and I'm a modest dresser). I'm hoping to find a nursing bra that I love so I can buy a few; this one is good, but I will not be buying another."
3,This product is ok,I am a plus size and this was one of the only bras I could find that fit me.The only negative is that it is not very supportive. It was comfortable just not supportive.
5,Love this bra!!,I ordered this bra because my other two were wearing out. It is so comfortable and the wide straps are great. I ordered a 2nd one today!
4,Performance Upgrade,I purchased this processor to replace the T5500 in my HP Pavillion laptop after the laptop warranty expired. Noticed an immediate performance increase and shorter wait times for most applications under Vista. Installation not for the unqualified and untrained though - antistatic protection and procedures are needed to ensure you don't damage either the processor or the system board during installation.
4,Great book for getting people hooked to mountain biking,"This is a great book for anyone getting into Mountain Biking. It is an easy read, with great illustrations. I would recommend the book to anyone picking up mountain biking and want to learn the technical stuff without getting bored!"
4,Solid book,"Not sure on negative reviews, but this is solid book on mtn biking. Granted some things are not up-to-date, but c'mon, do you need someone telling you that clipless pedals are the latest and greatest? Duh. The skills taught here are fundamental and very practical. What really separate this book from others is that the author tells it all, his bad experiences, good experiences and how we can learn from them. Very, very useful and will help you avoid countless cuts and bruises you would have gotten had you learned them from experience! And it's so much fun to read because the humor is just hilarious!"
5,Are you Kidding?!,"If you only have one book in your personal mtn bike library, this is the one. Funny! Interesting! Great illustrations! Originally purchased back in the old school days of the sport and is still the number one to have, mine is on the coffee table...and another copy in the office..."
2,A Look into the Past,"This is a well written, illustrated, and entertaining book on mountain biking skills, but it suffers from being quite outdated. Anyone who is more interested in contemporary mountain biking than ancient history would be better served with a more up to date tome that includes techniques more applicable to today's modern mountain bike technology. For example, toe clip pedals are not the cutting edge! Check out the Ned Overend book, Mountain Bike Like a Champion. There is also a video, Performance Mountain Biking that may be of interest."
1,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH HD SOUNDCARDS ! ! !,"They don't tell you this until you buy one, hook it up, follow the instructions, then go to their website (because their customer service/tech support phone number is out of service) and there if you follow the right sequence of links you can find this little gem: NOT COMPATIBLE WITH HD SOUNDCARDS ! ! !"
4,A good start to a trilogy that gets better book by book,"This is a fine book, with characters that come alive and prose with which it is easy to engage. The satire can be a bit heavy at times, but the story is nonetheless compelling"
1,Don't be fooled...,"I rented this thinking it was the documentary of the same title directed by Robin Hessman. This is a poorly dubbed, difficult to follow film--NOT a documentary."
5,Wonderful book,"What I liked best about this book is its focus on familiar poems and prayers, and not Sanskrit works that only scholars can decipher. Although Sanskrit remains a difficult language, Dr. Shah's book has made learning it much more enjoyable and for the first time, it seems possible."
5,Excellent book!!!,This book is sooooo good!!!! I really love it! It is helpful and reassuring and is written with humor. My recommendation on this one!!!
3,good looks not so strong,Good looking din fill in box for my Mustang radio conversion. Front facia not very secure. Tabs broke on initial installation requiring glue to finish the project. All is good now.
1,Awful!,Front cover would not stay attached to the pocket and therefore would not stay installed in the Mustang. Sent a complaint to the vendor...but I have received no help. Funny that I was asked for a review of the product now. I think this stuff is cheap junk. Buy at your own risk.
4,straight forward and is as easy as it says,"pretty straight forward...very easy to install,just took out factory cd player that was in the bottom slot in my dash and slipped this right in its place cause i no longer had a use for it cause i added an aftermarket stereo"
3,Too wordy,I was expecting a little more than I got. The book is not reader friendly. A little more wordy than I thought.
2,Misleading Title,"This is NOT Waylon Jennings' 1976 album, ""Are You Ready for the Country"". This is a compilation CD from Austrailia that includes songs from various parts of Waylon's career. Many of the songs are good, but the title is misleading and you would probably be better off getting the albums they were originally on, most of which are available on CD now."
2,A Dangerous Kind of Christian,"This book is dangerous in what it says about theology, authority, certainty, Scripture, hermeneutics, and apologetics. How's that for a very non-postmodern appraisal of the book? If you're intent on reading this book, try to also read D.A. Carson's book ""Becoming Conversant with the Emergent Church"" and also see if you can find David A. Mappes's review of the book in the July-September, 2004 edition of Bibliotheca Sacra."
4,This will go down in history,This book came from the right guy at the right time. A New Kind of Christian will go down in church history as one of the the most influential books on the church in our time. The face of Church as we know it will never be the same and this book has helped bring that change. Even if you have reservations about the emerging church or postmodernism you really should read this book.
3,A punch to the face of a disgruntled traditionalist.,"This book rocked me.Via a Socratic-like conversation between McLaren (me) and ""Neo"", wave after wave of unsettling and refreshing thoughts pummeled my heart, bringing me to tears at one point where I could see Christ within a retained Native American culture.For me, Evangelical based texts of late are filled with tired and irrelavent information which fails to reach those not accustomed to their specific language. This text, however, consolidated many of my own issues with current evangelicals, and offered hope of a fresh new world.If you're afraid to re-think and re-examine, this isn't a book for you. You'd be better off reading C.S. Lewis' Mere Christianity.If you're new to these thoughts, hold on to your hat . . . It's going to be a bumpy ride. But when you get out of the plane, you might find yourself in heaven."
5,a better understanding,"I was ready to abandon my faith. This book helped to to see that it wasn't my Christian faith I wanted to leave behind, but rather I wanted to abandon the modern Christian culture."
3,Emergent Theology,"I bought this book so I could be informed about ""the Emergent Church"" and their theology. It claims to be the same Christianity, just updated to relate to post-modern sensibilities. That was not my impression at all. There are several fronts on which they depart from traditional Christian theology, so it must be read carefully. It does do a good job in presenting the ideas of those involved in the Emergent Church movement."
1,written like a dime-store novel,"Just had to post: the style in which this is written, by the author's own admission, is not very good. This is, apart from the message, one of the worst books I've ever read. The attempted novel style was a big mistake and is distracting from the message. Not recommended."
3,"Great Topic, Poor Fiction","For the importance of the topic, I would give this book five stars. For writing quality as a work of fiction, I'd give it one star. So, I'm more-or-less splitting the difference and giving it three stars.As a former congregational minister (aka religious whipping-boy), I REALLY identified with the Pastor in the story. His pains were my own. The information and ideas are not so much conclusions, but starting points for further development.On the other hand,the fiction was written so badly as to be awkward and even distracting at times. McLaren may be a great preacher (I don't know) and he is probably very good at non-fiction (haven't read any by him yet) but fiction just isn't his genre, if this book is any indication."
3,"Interesting enough, but forgettable","A friend lent this book to me a few weeks ago. I read it, and found myself nodding in agreeing with much in it!The literary device of a dialogue between two friends keeps the book ticking along, and provides a fresh angle on the 'postmodernity' issue, and kept me reading to the endHowever, a few weeks later, I can't really remember all that much about what the book was about.I guess the message is 'postmodernity is coming and we'd better get ready for it' - which I agree with - but the book is stronger on diagnosis than cure.A readable intro to postmodernity, but I'm glad I borrowed not bought."
2,"Turns out ""Emergent"" is just a synonym for ""liberal.""","This book is a compelling portrait of an evangelical in epistemological crisis. His resolution? Infuse evangelical Christianity with liberal higher criticism theology. The only difference between Mclaren's Emergent Christianity and continental liberal Christianity is that he uses the latest graduate school words like ""post-modernism"" and ""deconstruction."" The book is primarily written to create ""new kinds"" of evangelicals and perhaps there are some good ideas within Emergent methodology for evangelical churches. However, if this book is an accurate representation of Emergent Theology, then it looks like the english writer G.K. Chesterson was right:""These are the days when the Christian is expected to praise every creed except his own."""
3,"Plenty of ""Food for Thought""","Prior to reading this book, I knew very little about the ""Postmodern Era"" and the ""Emergent Church,"" so I appreciated the opportunity to find out more about both. I agree with a lot of what McLaren says and I particularly liked his statement, ""In my thinking, church doesn't exist for the benefit of its members. It exists to equip its members for the benefit of the world. To do that it is about three things: community, spirituality, and mission--a kind of triangle, where each point is connected to the other two."" Where I disagreed with McLaren were in his treatment of faith and historical Christianity. A good book to get readers thinking about their own beliefs."
1,Stale Notions,"Rehashed ideas borrowed from 20th century liberal thinking a la ""inherent spiritual unity of all humanity in whatever sincere emergent faith expression eligible for integrative God-seeking commonality and synthesism"" wishful utopianism of the 1920's imported for a new generation. The only value we can see in this sort of humanist spirituality belief system is in observing with sadness how some people's version of what they choose Christianity to be on their terms they're comfortable with is so culturally driven. Just a little familiarity with mainline methodist moralist Wendell Berry mixed with catholic philosopher Walker Percy will show how heavily reliant is Neoism on Geoism."
2,Creative but Superficial,"The book contains a creative and interesting discourse between a burnout minister and his postmodern Christian teacher friend. I don't know what's happened to the 'modern' churches in America, but the concepts Brian McLaren expounds in the book aren't new at all. Christians have always been called to ""act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with God."" (Micah 6:8) A lot of the issues discussed in this book have been much more thorougly explained and illustrated in books about the kingdom community by such renowned Christian authors as John Stott and Howard Sydner first published in the 1980's. This one is comparatively superficial, but apparently much easier to read."
2,1 John 4:1-6,"Test the Spirits1)Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2)This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, 3)but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world.4)You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. 5)They are from the world and therefore speak from the viewpoint of the world, and the world listens to them. 6)We are from God, and whoever knows God listens to us; but whoever is not from God does not listen to us. This is how we recognize the Spirit of truth and the spirit of falsehood."
3,Constructive criticism,"I like the concept and the provocative nature of the book. I didn't like Neo being one guy with all the answers. Why not have the pastor character stumble into a community setting where the group is grappling with the ideas instead of pretending somebody can carry this banner alone? It just stretched credulity a bit too far for my imagination. Neo (and the author speaking through him) was restrained enough to avoid being called ""preachy"", but barely. Perhaps contrasting this book to the 5 STAR book ""Finding Faith"" is why I could only give it a 3."
5,Interesting read.,"A well written story that is packed with information. It does a great job of describing the struggle that the main character has with his Christian walk. Very thought provoking, makes you want to keep reading."
1,needs improvement,Mariah can make CDs but she seems to be having trouble making a good DVD. Perhaps it would be better if she really did go around the world rather than just 4 cities in the DVD. The title of this DVD is very misleading.
1,too much,This DVD is too much. You should get the CD's instead. She seems to be wearing too much makeup and too little clothing.
5,I LOVE IT !,Mariah Carey Around The Worlds is sooooooo good. I love this video so much.It was well put together and I love all the songs on it as well. If you don't have it you should buy it right away because your gonna love it !
2,Hair and Scissors,"I saw this video on VH1 and I Thouht:""This should be the tv version"", 'cause it was too short and the songs and footage were uglily edited. Then I bought it and what was my surprise?: The same version. I love Mariah a lot and I admire her for her voice singing live, that's why I don't understand why she doesn't sings Fantasy and Honey live. One of my fave songs is Whenever you call and the editor(Sanaa Hamri) practically killed it by pieces and put all the chattering of the people from 'around the world' in it, the same with Hopelessly devoted to you, my all and I'll be there. I think mariah looks very good with most of hairstyles, but with that kind of Afro she seems to be 4 a.m. and awaked by surprise. I think the only one guilty here is the editor and the only song saved from him is ""I still believe"" the rest is all damaged. And one last thing:Why only two bonus videos on vhs? Do we -vhs users- smell bad? Why dvd comes with 4? That's not fair."
1,Mariah Carey is losing ground,"I was thoroughly disappointed by this DVD. I think for someone who is supposed to be as great as Carey and then put out such a low quality production...Here is what could have been improved: Mariah should have shown more cities that she has been to. It would be better if more songs were added and if there was more commentary about how should went about writing those songs, a kinda of behind the scenes in writing the music type of thing. Also, there should be some effort to make the music last longer than a few times, because this music gets boring to listen to rather quickly since it is the same thing. Maybe that's why they call it popular music rather than classical."
3,Class Act,This DVD again shows Mariah's great vocal ability and stage presence. A rousing version of Hero is the best part. Unfortunately the dreadful editing is the only lowpoint but this isn't Mariah's fault!
3,"Disappointing, But Still Essential to Fans","PROS:- The videos to ""Butterfly"", ""Breakdown"", and ""The Roof"" can't be found anywhere else, and they're excellent videos.- The performance of ""Fantasy"" is great, love the chair theme.- It's nice to see behind-the-scenes Mariah. After viewing this, I really did feel I knew her a little better.- The conversation with Brenda K. Starr was interestingCONS-- Horrible editing of performances. ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"" was so short, and I really wanted to see that one.-I felt Mariah could of stretched herself vocally more in performances. Her live singing here pales in comparison to ""MTV Unplugged"" and ""Here is Mariah Carey""-The songlist was disappointing. Where is ""Vision of Love""? And ""Make It Happen""? And why couldn't she have sung the entire ""Butterfly"" instead of the little teaser intro.- The scenes of her swimming with dolphins and hanging out with Bing and Bong (the puppies) were actually longer than some of her performances!"
1,"You've gotta hand it to her, she's a great lip-syncher...","If Mariah Carey is such an incredible vocalist, then why are some songs on this video lip-synched?"
5,Mariah Carey Around the World,L I K E T H A T!MY ALLTe estoy pensando En mi larga noche en soledad Si el error fue amarte En mi corazón vuelvo a estar mal Porque estoy en ti Y no sé vivir Si a mi lado no estasMi todo yo te doy Por una noche más Y así poder sentir Tu cuerpo junto a mí Ya no puedo estar Reviviendo aquí nuestra canción Mi todo te lo doy Por tener tu amorDime si me sientes Imaginando verme frente a ti Siempre estás presente Y en mis sueños logro descubrir Que aunque ya no estás Mi estrella fugaz Te deseo alcanzarMi todo yo te doy Por una noche más Y así poder sentir Tu cuerpo junto a mi Ya no puedo estar Reviviendo aquí nuestra canción Mi todo te lo doy Por tener tu amorMi todo yo te doy Por una noche más Y así poder sentir Tu cuerpo junto a mí Ya no puedo estar Reviviendo aquí nuestra canción Mi todo te lo doy Por tener tu amor Mi todo yo te doy Mi amor Mi amor
5,Mariah Carey around the world,"One of the best video's Mariah has ever made because there is footage of Sydney Australia where I am from and also good to see that she never forgets the fans, an excellent video for Mariah fans"
1,can she still sing live ??!,"Ok, be warned, most of the performances here are lip-synched (""fantasy"", ""i still believe"", ""whenever i call you"" faking in duet with Brian McKnight...) or supported by heavy background vocals work or even pre-recorded sampled sequences (she fakes the high notes on ""emotions"" & ""honey"" endings as well as the ""dreamlover"" intro) and she seems in difficulties when she's actually singing all along the song - which is pretty rare (her performance on ""my all"", ""i'll be there"" are pretty average).So i'm wondering if she can still sing live, cuz i remember a time when she could sing during an entire gig, or is it the mega-tours that makes her so tired she got to sing less in order to perform every night ??Nevertheless, i don't think lip-synching is something a real diva should do - leave that to Britney please..."
1,YAWN!!!,"For years now, Mariah Carry has been feeding us the same song many ways. She seems to be going for the pop-chicken-award. No matter how many different ways you prepare chicken, IT's still chicken! And that goes for her music as well. No matter who she gets to duet with her, no matter how many titles she gives it... it's all the same tune, same song, same dull, bland sludge. I thought that she could never have proved this more then with her greatest hits album, but I was wrong. This video proves it even more. She's shallow, unattractive, boring and without even one talented bone in her whole body. I wish someone would clue her in that each and every word of a song doesn't have to be demonstrative of how high pitched she is or how much range her over-produced voice has. This kind of vulgarity only shows how much hot air her head is packed with!"
3,Very nice...but not very wearable.,"This is a nice pendant. It comes with a black rope cord necklace that is adjustable which is also very nice...but it is bigger than I expected. The only other disappointing thing is it is completely flat on one side so it doesn't lay against you well and when it flips it looks funny.The front is very nicely detailed and a nice sort of brushed metal pewter/silver. It is a nice piece to hang on the wall, but maybe not around your neck.It came in a very nice dark blue velvet bag as well."
1,Thank you or your reviews,"While the pendant does have a nice, unique look that we were looking for for my daughter's boyfriend, I am remeinded after reading your reviews why we shouldn't stray from stronger metals for jewelry. Thank you for preventing me from making a mistake."
1,HUGE,the star was huge i thought it was going to be a necklace but the star was more of a big keychain.
1,"Save your time and money, folks","This book is NOT a design tool. It's not much of anything, as a matter of fact. It resembles a dumbed-down PowerPC data book, and is marginally easier to read, but it contains much less useful information. The text lacks sufficient detail to be implementation oriented. It focuses far too much on programming basics to be considered design oriented. I think perhaps it was intended to serve as an introductory manual for people who don't know how to read data books.If you're thinking of using this tool in a classroom setting, please don't. There is little or no information in it that can't be obtained FREE by downloading the PowerPC ""Programming Environments"" data book and the specific data book for your particular processor directly from Motorola."
4,Sad but true,"I am from the city where much of the story is based. I can remember many of the stories highlighted in the book from our local news. The author does a good job of combining those stories with her own personal stories from the classroom. By doing so, I think she shows an accurate portrayal of the field of teaching.This book is a must read for new and veteran teachers as well as those thinking of entering the profession."
4,No catchy title here,"Sport is an artist who wears his heart and his influences on his sleeve, and nowhere is this fact more evident than on his latest release ""Uncle."" A moving tribute to his lost nephew, killed in the line of duty in the WTC on 9/11, the album is neither a melancholy, maudlin affair, nor is it some uplifting ""my heart will go on"" BS. The magic of ""Uncle"" is that Sport has the unique lyrical ability to wallow in the misery that is the human condition and still keep a twinkle in his eye. The music is at once rooted in the traditional and wildly experimental, which adds a certain playfulness to album. The liner notes state the album was recorded to make something his nephew would have enjoyed, and there are a fair amount of lighter tracks, but Sport is at his best when his life is at its worst, and his heartbreak has produced a truly moving collection."
4,"Great features, but very loud","As far as features go, this is a great machine. It has the TV Guide feature on it, which makes recording tv shows very simple. I have an older Toshiba DVD Player/Recorder that uses the VCR+ system to record shows, which never worked quire right (you basically had to program it like an old VCR). So, I'm very pleased with the ease of use of this machine.The only drawback I've found on this DVD Player/Recorder is the fan, as noted by other reviewers. I bought this one to use in the bedroom, but after the first night, had to move it to the living room. The fan was SO loud, that there was no sleeping in the same room with it. I'm used to other machines that are a little loud when they're on and in use, but this one is constantly loud, even when it's off. As long as you're not buying this unit for use in the bedroom, then you should get it, becuase other than the noise, it's a great product."
3,Nice product but almost obsolete,"This product has many great features but lacks the ability to record from High-Def stations. Thus it will be obsolete in the very near future. If you can afford to replace it in two years, I would recommend this product. If you can't, you should look for something else."
1,"Good idea, TERRIBLE manual, wish i could get it to work.","It was reasonably inexpensive at the time, but i wish i had bought one that worked more than a 10th of the time. I say pass on this item"
3,Panasonic much better,"I own a Panasonic DVR which I really like. I wanted a second one for my bedroom, and this one was less expensive. Big Mistake. It does what it says it will, but everything takes two or three more steps. There is a couple second delay for many of the functions. You can't watch a DVD while recording a program. Nothing works smoothly with this unit. I really wish I had bought another Panasonic. Also the fan is loud and on 24/7. It just isn't a good design.I gave it 3 stars because it does work."
1,So noisy we returned it the first day,"The unit emits a constant humming sound. Other revewiers describe it as a fan noise, which it may well be, but it sort of sounds like the refrigerator when the compressor kicks on, only not quite as loud. It makes the sound even when the unit is turned off (as long as it is plugged in). It might not be so bad if it only made the noise when it was in use, because the TV sound mostly masks it at moderate volume. But it is still very audible when watching TV at low volume or when flipping between channels. Most importantly, when the TV is off, it is terribly annoying. We decided after less than an hour to box the unit up and return it. If you like to read or sleep or relax in the same room as your TV, this unit is probably not for you."
2,not compatible w/ my TV & charter cable,"i bought this DVR based on the fabulous reviews by other customers... but i had to return 2 of these products.first was defective.second was able to start up, but the tv guide - and therefore the recording ability of the DVR - was not compatible with my tv and charter cable."
1,Maybe it was just defective.,"I was excited to order this product after reading the high reviews it got but was very disappointed by it and returned it. After one week it still had not picked up the TV Guide which my old Philips unit would pickup in one day. So I thought maybe it needed a cable box to work better so I rented one from the cable company. It did get the guide then using the G-Link IR blaster but then the cable box stopped showing a picture. Got another cablebox, same thing! Got another cablebox, used my old Philips, no problem! And I could not get it to automatically record anything! I manually recorded a program and copied it to DVD and it was sooo slow. I decided my old Philips HDRW-720 wasn't so bad after all. It occassionally goes brain-dead and loses it's settings but at least it works."
4,Toshiba RD-XS35 DVD Player/Recorder with 160 GB Hard Drive,"Personally I love it. Able to record over a weekend unlimited abouts of TV without wondering if the tape will run out.The only problem so far is at the beginning when I fast forward there was a bar on the bottom of the screen to show me how far in the program I was. That died and when I tried to bring it back up it was frozen in mid path. So I leave it hidden. The counter on the front display still works.Since the bar died, so did the channel display. I select a channel and it use to display what I typed in. Now I select the channel and wait 20-30sec to see if it changes to what I selected. Yes it's slow to change channels if you type in the numbers. If you use the arrow up or down to change channels. That's normal speed.After 2009 it's not going to matter anyway. Since it's not digital. Just another spent item that can not change with progress."
2,terrible design,"while it worked well for the first few weeks, it soon stopped recognizing all DVDs and now needs to be repaired. It is very poorly designed with no thought to the user. The remote controls are counter intuitive and require repeated consultation with the multiple owners manuals to try to perform simple operations. Even though I have TV guide channel on my cable the unit is unable to recognize it or get information needed for programming. Manual programming is cumbersome. This is the worst purchase I've made in a long while."
4,Get ready to read,The manual is not very easy to use. There is a lot in there and it takes a lot of reading to start to understand it. Without the book you cannot get around very far. Would be better is there were more helps. Overall it is a very nice machine and is working well you us.
4,good dvr,love this product. good picture and sound. will definitely buy this one again or any similar product. a little bit expensive but worth it.
2,Wouldn't buy another one.,I had many difficulties with this product. It has impeccable playback on the DVD and DVR/HDD side. I planned on using it to replace my TIVO and I found that the TV Guide online programming was extremely unreliable and quirky. The most annoying thing was that I couldn't scroll through this listings without the darn thing trying to change the channel. I could not find a setting to correct this. I am someone who rarely uses the instruction book and I found myself consulting the instructions on a weekly basis. This thing is just too darn difficult to use at least compared to TIVO. The clarity of the picture versus my TIVO Series 2 is much better so I guess I would consider that a pro. However it is a pain in the butt for regular TV watching.
3,Helps keep tank clean,"The cleaning cartridge helps keep the tank clean, but I have found it doesn't last as long as advertised. I have to change it every 2 or 3 weeks."
2,Little iffy,This product turned my water and unit yellow. However it did help my water not smell. so for the most part it did help the water but for some reason discolored my unit.
5,These last 30 days - and do the job,I use these in my new Lasko 1128 9-Gallon Evaporative Recirculating Humidifier and they seem to do the trick with ease. You simply drop one into your water and it lasts at least 30 days - couldn't be easier.
1,"so um, what does this do?",I;m not exactly certain why I purchased this item.... it does not seem to do much other than float in the water.
1,"misleading, not anti-bacterial","I used this with a new filter for less than a month and found that bacteria was present and the filter needed to be replaced. I will be using a liquid bacteriostat from now on.Also confirming this information provided by another reviewer:The description for this cartridge says that it ""provides continuous protection against mold and bacteria"" with its ""Aquastat"" antimicrobial technology. If you read the literature that comes with it, however, it says that it prevents microbe growth *in the cartridge*. Not in your humidifier. It's not an antimicrobial cartridge; it's a demineralization cartridge."
2,Packing Error,"The product is what I expected, and the price was good for the advertised quantity. However, the packers at Amazon must have misunderstood the quantity description, or possibly the description was truncated. I was supposed to receive a pack of 3 packages. Each package has 2 cartridges. The packers sent me only two packages in the shipping container. Also, the packing slip did not include a customer service phone number."
1,This Tube Wringer is HUGE!,"This tube wringer is a lot larger than any of the Dr. Hauschka tubes. Since it said that it was a tube wringer by Dr.Hauschka I just assumed it would be the correct size for the tubes. It does work, but it's so large and awkward that I ended up not using."
4,"Let me hear you say, BOOTSY!","Really good disc though extremely expensive for us in the States; (40 bucks plus shipping for about 80 minutes of the Funk). It looks and sounds great with the only real draw back (other than the price tag) being the guitarist playing the ""Star Spangled Banner,"" and not doing anywhere near as well as Hendrix did it. If the set was longer I wouldn't even mention it, but why waste precious Funk time on solos? Bernie has a solo which is good, but nothing mind blowing and of course Bootsy goes absolutely ape during ""I'd Rather Be with You."" The medley of the first 5 tracks is as good as any incarnation of the Rubber Band, and is the highlight of the show. Diehards will most surely pick this up, while the casual fan will probably have to wait for something a bit more inexpensive."
4,Enlightening!,"This is a beautiful little book, with simple explanations for each birthday of the year + an easy way to discover more about all of your most important relationships."
5,Great Resource,"I thought this book was very well written and researched. I would highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to learn more about precious metal mining in the old west. This book covers many subjects in detailed chapters that include the Gold Rush, Hard Rock Mining, Timbering, Pumping, Explosives, Machine Drills, Transportation, Power & Fuel, Fire Assay, Mills & Smelters, Mill Machinery, and an appendices that includes Mining & Milling Hazards."
1,It's been over a month and still no book!,"I ordered this book on December 9, 2010 with the intention of giving it for a Christmas present. It is now January 10, 2011 and I still haven't received it. What's up with that?"
5,Great phone,"After problems with the 2.4 Ghz phones interferring with our wireless connection, we decided to try this unit. So far, the computers work as does the phone. It's easy to program (excellent directions) and attractive to look at. The range seems to be more than adequate for our needs. We recommend it for those who have a wireless connection in their homes (and anyone else who just wants a good cordless telephone)."
2,TERRIBLE SPEAKERPHONE ON HANDSET,"Had to return the phone because of poor speakerphone quality. I absolutely loved the feature when calling from home, but when I called to home from work, it sounded liked I was talking to someone with[$]walkie-talkie. The speakerphone also mutes out background noises when no one is talking, this makes callers think the call was dropped. Reviews I have read on 2.4 vs 5.8 GHz technology suggest little overall advantage in clarity, definitely not worth the extra dough."
2,weak,Address book entries reduce available caller ID list. Poor range. 900Mhz DSS much greater range. Very disappointing. It does not interfere with my wireless broadband router on 2.4Ghz. but neither does the 900Mhz phones. I would go with the 900Mhz Digital Spread Spectrum (DSS).
2,"Great Features, lousy sound quality","After seeing this phone in Popular Science I thought I would give it a try. The phone is nice looking and is feature rich but the speaker phones on the base and handset(s) is terrible. The microphone on the base is actually underneath the phone. The voice quality with the hand sets is not much better. If you want to sacrifice sound quality for features this will work for you, but I'm going back to my old Panasonic cordless they are the best."
4,sudden low battery cut-out,"Overall, this is a pretty good phone and I'm going to stick with it (despite buying and dumping two or three similar phones in the past). The reception is good and the construction is solid.The only problem after several months of use is that the battery dies suddenly without warning and I usually loose the call. It starts beeping, then a few seconds later the call is gone. I wish it gave like a one minute morning or something."
2,High price for little features,"I wanted a 5.8Ghz phone, due to the fact my current cordless phones and WiFi run on 2.4Ghz. So I got the Uniden TRU5885-2 only to find out that it didn't do wait my current phones do - intercom, from handset to handset or to base. Just a page/call transfer feature. I found out how handy intercom was with my 2.4Ghz phone, when you're in back yard and the other is in the house, you don't have to yell out the window to talk, just intercom with the phones. Also it didn't have a ""line in use"" light/led, so you didn' know if someone is having a conversation before picking up and dialing...really annoying there. Other then that, which I deemed very important; I'm spoiled now yes, but for the price of these phones, not worth it. I'll look around more and/or wait to see if other models come out with all the cool features one might require in a $200 phone without going to a multi-line system."
1,I Am Not Impressed,"I have owned this phone for about 14 months and I was never very satisfied with the voice quakity or the range. The real disappointment came just a few days ago - the second handset no longer operates. It is completely dead and will not charge, even though I replaced the $15 battery pack. I think I will go back to 2.4 ghz technology and stick with phones under $100."
5,WOW!,"This phone kicks ...!!...The Uniden is great, longer range, better voice quality, a real bargin ...."
3,Terrible Range,"After a thorough search for a great phone with excellent range, I chose this one based on online reviews. Unfortunately, I cannot even use it on my deck, which is only 100 feet away from the base. I am disappointed in the range."
2,The speakerphone on the base did not work,I was very happy to get this 5.8GHz uniden phone. But when I started to use it the first day the speaker phone on the base did not work. I had to return it. I will most probably settle for a 2.4 GHz with another company.
1,IT doesnt help much!!,This book doesnt help much to the people who wants to learn gujarati fast. Its a rather boring and sometimes lenghty idiotic stereotype of words/sentences which are apparently easy if learnt directly from a translator.buy this book only if you want to waste your money.
4,good book,This is a very good book. It is very good for children. I use this book for my children and they learn a lot from it. It is very easy to understand. I am very thankful to Mr. K. Shah.
1,Just a CD... cost me 89USD,"nothing..just one cd.. no book, no userguide..for a foreigner like me.. its.. completely useless"
4,Its a lighter brown than I thought. more like cocoa or hot chocolate brown not dark brown.,"Shipped fast, an excellent strap and I'm very happy with it despite the lighter brown color than what I thought I ordered. So far, the suede is leaving little suede lint balls but I think it will be fine once its all broken in. A little shorter than I thought...it just fits."
3,"Good strap, not great","I must say that I really, really, really want to love this strap. However, the peg-holes are just too small. I don't know if the Breedlove factory strap pegs are too big, or if I happened to receive a particularly tight strap, but it does annoy me. The strap has only come loose on me once."
4,Good Book,"I really liked this book but some of the stories are the exact duplicate of what is found in ""Chicken soup for the Soul, Children with Special Needs."" I found that kind of frustrating."
4,Pop diva of eighties gives you all her hits on one CD,"This album is a great review of all greatest hits of Samantha Fox (pop and sex diva od late eighties) Starting with the first giant hit Touch Me (I Want Your Body) you will find on it also other songs, like Nothing's Gonna Stop Me Now (written by well known producers trio Stock-Aitken-Waterman, that also made music for Rick Astley, Kylie Minogue...), classic dance hits I Wanna Have Some Fun, Love House and many more. This compilation is a mixture of easy pop tunes of eighties with elements of dance music, that sometimes makes you want to dance. All songs are in normal radio versions. I enjoy listening Samantha Fox's songs when I was younger, so I bought this CD recently, although I have all his albums on LPs. But they are mostly damaged because they were frequently played on my record-player so the tune is in bad quality. So, fans of music of eighties, let's make up your minds and buy this record. It is definitely worth buying."
2,"Low Quality, low price","Yeah, the price of these towels was appealing to me as someone trying to stock my first apartment after getting married, but we did not get high quality. After you take a shower and dry yourself, expect to have black lint from the towel on your body. Even after a few washes, the ""shedding"" continues. Advice: use these as decorations, perhaps, or hand towels. Spend 10 dollars more for ""real use"" towels."
2,Not worth the money,"This book briefly details 101 different careers in nursing. Each career is given about a page, and it has about 2-5 sentences about what the nurse would do, special skills needed, outlook in career field and links to organizations/associations to find out more information. I think it's not worth the money because you can find all the same information online just if you do a random search of nursing careers. The descriptions are not detailed enough to really tell you anything. Also the book includes several 'interviews' with nurses in various fields described in the book. I was not impressed, it looked to me like the nurses had a lot of time to edit their answers and none of the interviews actually said anything that would be useful. Again, it would be better to just search online for this information. I am just considering nursing school at this point, and I do recommend another book 'A career in nursing, is it right for me?' which was also found on Amazon."
3,Worth a read,"This book was worth the read for me because I write about the nursing profession and used it for research purposes. It can also be useful as a starting point for nurses who want to make a career change or new nurses who are looking for a nursing specialty to get into after nursing school. It does give you websites that you can go to for more information although some website addresses are unavailable due to sites moving or not existing anymore for whatever reason. You won't find salaries here but it does tell you if the employment outlook is low, medium or high. Also you'll find interviews with nurses in different specialties on how they got started, what they do and advice to nurses who want to get into that specialty .It's worth a read, it helped me in what I wanted to do."
4,Great leader.,"I got this so my mom and kids could walk my large high energy dog. He behaves nicely and does not pull at all. He does, however, rub his face on anything and everything possible when we stop. I have used it for a couple weeks and he still seems to be a bit annoyed. The key point is he is fine while we are walking"
5,Should Have Just Bought This First,"I have a 10 month old yellow Lab that likes to pull. I tried the Easy Walk Harness which worked well but no matter how I adjusted it Sophie would end up with a raw spot under her arm.I had used a Gentle Leader with our previous Lab and it worked well, but Sophie is a little bit a challenge when it comes to new things and I wasn't sure she would tolerate the nose part. It does take a while to get them use to it but follow the instructions and watch the video. It has taken Sophie a little longer than some dogs to get use to it and she will occasionally still want to paw at her nose, but that is Sophie, nothing is ever easy with her. However once the game of get it on my nose if you can stops she loves her walks and so do I. I recommend this item highly."
5,Great BUY!!,"This was the best bed spread buy I have EVER bought in my life. I have bought Christopher Lowell stuff at $300.00 and it FELL APART after a month of owning it.. I have bought walmart's stuff at almost $100.00 and it too was junk. This comforter has got to be the most beautiful and least expensive comforter I have ever purchased!!! I recommend it to ANYBODY!!! Amazon shipped quickly and it arrived WAY before their estimated due date. Beautiful, gorgeous and well worth your money!! You just have to FEEL the fabric on this set its like sleeping on a cloud!!! :D LOVE IT LOVE LOVE IT!!"
1,Ripped and pieced together! :-(,I was so excited to get this comforter (even tho it was previously $29.99) and when I took it out of the bag the side was ripped and the top of the comforter had been pieced together with a line all the way across. Plus it barely fit the top of our King bed. Very disappointed; it's being returned. :-(
1,Size matters,"The so-called ""King"" size comforter is much smaller than it should be and can barely cover king size bed."
1,Only got a few pages out of this cartridge.,"For some reason, I have only got a few pages out of this ink cartridge. The product must have been defective."
5,Good buy,"Exactly as described and brand new in box. Installed it in my printer and worked like a charm, for a cheaper price. Will buy again."
3,The ink runs out very quickly,"Unless you can refill cartridges, I would not recommend using printers that take this cartridge. This cartridge is very costly for the low number of printouts it produces."
4,CL31 Canon ink cartridge - color,"Although the cartridge was installed a couple of days ago, it's replacing the previous one which came installed on the printer. It works just fine but I'm not satisfied with it's longevity."
2,Don't get a refurbished cartridge,Don't get a refurbished cartridge. The Computer chip was not updated and the ink supply lasted about 1 month. I print out about 5 pages a week and 90% is black ink. Black ink is still going strong.
5,Great DVD,I pick a lot of my DVD to get a look at what goes on behind the scenes and in what it takes to get the music from inside their heads and then on a CD or a DVD.
4,This DVD is for anyone interested in the making of music.,"The dvd has great interviews with the band and shows their creative juices flowing in the recording studio. Anyone who would be intersted in the ""behind the scenes"" making of an Aerosmith album would be interested in this DVD. It takes the viewer from the moment of concept right through to the finished product of selected songs. The band agonizes over every note, and riff, trying to achieve perfection. DVD also has live clips from concerts. Great entertainment, educational, and good value for your money."
3,Fascinating stuff for the hardcore fan,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching The Making of Pump. It is a fascinating look into the inner workings of a band in the process of putting together what would become a landmark album. On the other hand, I couldn't help but see some striking resemblances to This Is Spinal Tap...from arguments over the title of the album, to debates over which lyrics might to too risque for Top 40 radio. But then what else can you expect from a band that specializes in rock-n-roll lunacy like Aerosmith?"
5,A rare chance to see how a great band creates a great album!,"I don't know why some people are giving this one star. This video wasn't released to rip people off. If what you want are costly music videos, don't buy this. It's called THE MAKING of PUMP. That means that it takes you in the studio and shows you the band writing and producing songs intended for the PUMP album. I'm very glad that this video was released (as well as the Chili Peppers' Funky Monks video) because it's an extremely rare view to see the band in. I love the album PUMP and the video made the album even better for me because I saw that the band put a lot of work and heart into the album and still had alot of fun in the process. This is like a non-glamerous version of MTV's ""Making the..."" shows. There aren't any special camera effects and the band isn't covered in makeup. It's just to show what the process of making the album was like. And I love it (and I'm not even a HUGE Aerosmith fan)."
2,average,"not bad in terms of seeing the bad boys of boston behind the scenes in the studio but bad in terms of dvd entertainment - no special features, no menu, there isn't even any artwork on the disc.I think I speak on behalf of most Aerosmith fans when I say that the record company needs to release an Aerosmith concert on DVD for us. They must be the only band in the world that don't have a live concert to buy whenever you walk into a virgin megastore or a wallmart! It's frustrating! They should have even released an ""OH YEAH! GREATEST VIDEO HITS"" to coincide with the CD & the dvd could have had special features to make up for the songs without videos - for example big ten inch live, dream on live, etc. Surely this would have been more exciting to us fans than this!!No wonder Aerosmith don't get the recognition they deserve if you cant even buy a concert or video compilation on DVD."
3,nice colors,"I was expecting a larger box but this is more like an 8x8 box. I bought these as gifts, sadly the writing on the inside box was in chinese. Shipping took about 3 weeks."
1,Scrapbooking OK Not for Hair,"These chalks I have tried and smear for card making, you have to spray them, but also for hair they cannot be blended like another companies. I was disappointed when I tried them, and too dusty."
4,Great for hair chalking!,I am using these to chalk my hair and do crazy colors. Due to my job I can't dye my hair anymore so this was a great alternative soluton for fun and funky colors.
1,No good,"I bought [2] remotes but could not program, eather one, be extra carful when buying this item, you might be throwing your money away,"
3,"somewhat helpbut, but also annoying","Although the book provides some useful information about color, composition, and difficult subjects, the author's premise throughout the book--that if you follow her advice, you will make beautiful paintings--is misleading. The book shows ""problem"" paintings followed by ""solution"" paintings. Unfortunately, many of the ""problem"" painting are purposely painted to look they were done by a 12 year old, while the ""solution"" paintings are painted by talented artists. Simply following the author's advice will not change the problem paintings into works of art. It would have been helpful if the author HAD demonstrated just what it is that separates amatuerish paintings from good ones. Her book doesn't do that."
2,Good......bad......worse.,"Well, I thought the idea of a shocking alarm clock was genius, and it was (for as long as it lasted anyway). The product felt a little cheap from the start, but it worked nevertheless. The shock was intense, and there was no way I wasn't going to wake up the following morning, only problem is that it started to malfunction by the morning. The alarm just wouldn't stop ringing(by the way, the bells don't serve too much pupose, as they're only there to shock you), even after I removed one battery; needless to say the shocking feature never worked again. Great idea, bad assembly; not a good combination. Although it is very likely that this was a one time thing, and I happened to be the consumer with the rotten luck, I kind of doubt it; seeing as how the product did have a pretty cheap feel to it. If you intend on purchasing the alarm clock, just be aware there is a chance that your alarm too might be disfunctional."
2,You get what you pay for....,"Cheap price = cheap product in this instance. Worked for about a month and then went crazy. It started randomly going off whenever it chose. To make matters worse, the only way to shut the stupid thing off is to pull the battery which requires removing a screw (try doing that during the middle of the night!)."

3,"A slow, slow book...","There's only one word to describe this book: Slow. The prologue started out good, but then everything went on slowly. The action was slow, the characters were boring, (save for Pippa who was a tad refreshing) and I was very tempted to stop reading the book, but (luckily?) I continued.The story started picking up halfway through when Pen started to actually look for The Son Who -she believes- Is Still Alive with Owen. So the story proceeded on slowly, and still ended up okay.So basically, the second half of the book is the redeeming part. But if you are someone who, like me, cannot wait for the plot to slowly develope, you might do well by skipping this one."
1,Flat and disappointing,"I own 22 books by Jane Feather....so, you can see I am a big fan; however, if this were the first book I read of hers, I would not read another. The characters are flat. Even though I had met Pen in a previous book by Jane Feather, I found that I could not connect with the character at all. The book starts out with a pretty good prologue; but, then the story line doesn't feel credible. Read any other book by Jane Feather. She's an excellent author. But, stay away from this one."
3,Please edit your ebook,"I'm reading this book for a publishing class, the information feels a little outdated,but usable for class. The real disappointment is in editing for the ebook. The formatting is a mess, and entire paragraphs are hard to make sense of, I suspect they were meant to be bullet points before the formatting was messed up, because they are now a pile of run on sentences. Particularly disappointing that a Publishing book seems to have some serious publishing problems."
3,Knowledge is key and this books has plenty!,"Its very hard for me to read ""how to"" novels, because I am afraid that somethings may be misleading. However, when consulting with this text, I was very pleased with the authors knowledge of the subject and how each topic was handled and presented to the reader. I had confidence in the information and would recommend this to anyone desiring to expand their knowledge in this field!Rene Reyes, Esq"
5,Very helpful,My partner and I read this book together. He found it extremly helpful and we learned more about each other and sexual abuse. It helped him understand that other people struggled like he has. We found our relationship imporved a great deal after reading this book.
3,It's got a good beat and you can dance to it but......,"This book was suggested to me by my husband's counselor. The format is easy to read, no plowing through chapter by chapter. Remember though, this was written by a survivor. There is some very good advice for partners but it seems geared towards accomodating the survivor and not addressing the needs of the partner.It is a good book, if your partner is well into the healing process. I don't recommend this book if your partner has just begun healing. If they've just started healing, read this as a companion book to Ken Graber's _Ghosts in the Bedroom_. I found some of the sections in _Allies in Healing_ helpful and enlightening. But when I got to the sections dealing with sex my heart sank. To be told to get used to being a nun/monk is more than a little disheartening."
3,Helpful but,"This book has a pro-survivor slant. Don't expect great sympathy or support for your desire to be sexually active with your partner, or to hear how your partner is responsible for making the relationship work too."
2,Disappointing,"I agree with the readers who found this book disappointing. Yes, the survivor of abuse has different needs than the partner who hasn't been abused, but this book doesn't really shed any light on having a relationship with this person. Instead, I highly recommend Miss America By Day by Marilyn VanDerber. This book gives true insight into being with a survivor of abuse."
1,But what do you do when the person you love...,"makes false allegations that they were sexually abused based on ""recovered memories"" as encouraged by Courage to Heal?"
2,Hurtful with lack of hope for a spouse suffering celibacy,"I,m sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but this book was very hurtful to me in the darkest days of my marriage. The chapter on sex says in effect, the abused spouse needs to taking a ""healing vacation"" from sex, it then goes on to tell the non-abused spouse: you'll learn to live without, apparently forever. There was no assurance it would ever get better. Fortunately my marriage did get better, but this book didn't. The authors mean well and have much good to offer, but if you've been a married monk for 12 months, you don't want to hear it."
5,Get this book for your spouse NOW :),"I'm a sibling incest survivor, and this book really helped my husband understand what I went through. I'd highly recommend it to the partner of anyone who was sexually abused."
1,depressing and hopeless,"The chapter on sexual relations says in so many words,""you'll learn to live without"". It advocates giving the survior a ""healing vacation from sex"", but never says that things get better. All the ""case historys"" are of people still celibate. Thanks but no thanks, in my time of darkest despair, could they hold out just a little ray of hope? If surviors can never have a sex life, tell me now."
2,Extremely heavy for travel,I was very disappointed in this hair dryer for travel use. It is twice as heavy as the dryer I was replacing. This would be a good choice for the person who wants a compact dryer for home use.
2,Good but juvenile,"This is a good book, I think, and it helps me with math. But the author has a tone that would be better for someone half my age. I know that a lot of people take a Princeton Review course, but does this author know anything about high school?"
1,Great idea but . . .,"I had a bad experience with this product. The first one I ordered (for my 8-year-old who loves to play chess but can't always find a partner) arrived without white playing pieces. I emailed Saitek, asking if they could send the parts, but they never responded to my email. I sent it back to Amazon, and they were great about quickly sending out another. Unfortunately, the second one had a defective computer. I won't be buying Saitek again."
5,SPIN IT GIRL,Thank you Miss DJ Irene. This is a super dynamic groove CD that will keep you ravin all night. DJ Irene you are a spin GODDESS!
4,Fine Anthology From Atlantic!,"This album features many fine tracks from the Atlantic Hall & Oates albums, including songs from ""No Goodbyes"" like ""It's Uncanny"" and ""I Want To Know You for A Long Time"". A special bonus is the finished version of ""Past Times Behind"" which has a nice mid-tempo country flavor to it. It was done during the ""Whole Oats"" sessions and probably would have been on it if we had CDs then.Daryl didn't like the 1974 photos on it but oh well... every true artist is his own biggest critic.Buy it for the bonus, and get ALL their albums, you'll like 'em."
1,The worst dance compilation I know,"I had heard quite a bit of record company BS about this release and spent months and months tracking it down. I got it and couldn't believe it, the dance equivalent of a car wreck. Basically, it is awful, incoherent and unlistenable. Do I need to say more? No groove, no soul just plain bad. I regret buying this. Whatever you do, don't buy it without hearing it first. Is that why you can't listen to samples here?"
2,This is an interview with Randolph Winters.,"This is a question & answer format. Winters covers general & basic questions about the Pleiades. At the very end some pictures & video are shown of some Miami sightings. Not worth 18 dollars. If you already know about the Pleiades, you don't need to see this. Far more(and more accurate) information about the Pleiades & the Pleiadians can be found on Billy Meier's official web site."
3,Not the whole story,"Baker and Weisbrot make a good presentation of their argument -- that social security really isn't in a crisis. But their efforts to make it readable also mean that many important numbers are left out -- e.g., how fast will the economy have to grow for the crisis to be avoided,what is social security's return compared to stocks and bonds, etc. At the end of the day, most of the best analysts from BOTH sides of the argument disagree with them, but Baker and Weisbrot's reply is usually to claim that these people are tools of Wall Street. It's just not that simple."
1,Social Security is broken for those under 40,"The authors fail to show how the current social security system will pay out less than 20% of what young participants (those under 40) contribute over their working careers. And this ridiculously low return on contributions (adjusted for inflation) does not even allow those participants to get any ""real"" return on their investment. Putting money into a passbook savings account will at least return close to the rate of inflation so that over the long haul you'll get back something close to what you put in. The authors fail to show how badly shortchanged the young contributors are by the current system. For this reason I don't recommend anyone under 40 to bother reading this book if they want to get the truth on social security."
1,They can have it,"If the authors of this books think Social Security is such a wonderful investment, and that the market is risky, then they can stick their money in it, but I want out. Oh wait, there goes their money! You mean it's not invested? Of course not, it's a legalized Ponzi scheme. ""Pay as you go"" is the politically correct expression.At WORST, the stock market has returned 6% for *ANY* 40 year period in its history. Pick a date, any date, then figure out the returns 40 years from that date, and the worst return you would have is 6%.So I'll make a deal with the Authors, and Mr. Al Gore. You can keep everything I paid into the system so far (I'm 31), and I'll sign a contract that states I'll never take a penny of tax payer money as long as I live if I get to invest MY own money and I'll take care of myself for the rest of my life. Think of all the money they'll save when I retire! I have a feeling they're not going to let me live my own life, however..."
1,"Jeez, I guess these guys got it wrong!","Well, it's now 2007, and there's very little doubt by anyone (even left-wing nut jobs like these guys) that if something is not done, the Social Security system WILL FAIL. How many people bought into their flat earth diatribe? These guys are probably related to the fellows who wrote the 1943 book: ""Splitting the Atom: Junk Science"". The book unfortunately is wishful thinking, spun around manipulated data. Propaganda, not misinterpreted information."
2,Very disappointing,Snippets of great music constantly interrupted by talking heads saying nothing we don't already know. I would give it 1 star but for the Tonight duet by Patinkin and McDonald which I would give 10 - overwhelming; their singing and their interraction were almost unbearingly moving. But all the rest was blah.
3,SOUNDS LIKE SHE'S GONNA BLOW,"Received my ""MAC"" last week. After being back-ordered for 2 weeks finally arrived. To my relief after reading the reviews, it was in perfect shipping condition. Not a scratch. Set it up, plugged it in and whoa!! It sounded like it was going to rattle itself apart. Ran it according to breakin specs. hoping it would quiet down. It never did. The plastic shroud rattles from the compressor vibration. It is almost unbearable. It could be the cooling fan out of balance. Not sure what to do at this point."
1,Big disappointment.,"I've been a diehard Makita fan for years. However, I was extremely disappointed with this compressor. Within a couple of days, one of the wheels snapped (during normal use). Within a few months, the replacement for that wheel and the other wheel broke, both pivots for the locking levers on the handle sheared off, and the cooling fan worked itself loose and began eating at the housing.This compressor DOES NOT work on most 15 amp circuits; it just hums and sounds as if it's about to burn up. I comes from the factory with a low pressure setting. So if you're using a framing gun, it doesn't kick back on in time to have continuous nailing. There are adjustment screws for this inside the switch box, but that should not be necessary.Overall, I think Makita should go back to the drawing board on this one or risk losing many long-time customers."
1,Continued disaster shipments,"After all the previous review complaints for YEARS here about damaged boxes and bent items, you would have thought someone would take a look into this. Nope. Just received a $350 compressor in a busted up box with the engine cover scratched, wheel and axle bend inward so hard it wouldn't even roll and the cord retainer bracket bent down to the paint snapping off of the frame. If you want to invest time into moving over 100 lbs in and out of boxes and figuring out how much of your life will be wasted trying to move and return this tank, go ahead and ignore the bad reviews. Looks like a great rig if you go down to the store and buy one that didn't fall 5', 10'...? However many feet to the ground. You'll have no idea of the other unseen structural damage until later on down the road I suppose. This was a gift and the reviews are always worth reading here it proves. Always have good luck w amazon when I read the reviews first."
5,"Great ""Mid Sized"" compressor!","I purchased this compressor to power a portable abrasive blaster, some small air tools, framing nailer, HVLP spray gun and general ""around the house"" air needs. I couldn't be happier! Arrived in two days, free shipping with Amazon Prime, shipper was in good condition and compressor was in perfect shape.It recycles quickly and is fairly quiet for a compressor this size. As others have said, folds nicely, holds 50' of hose on the handle in upright or folded position. Since Makita changed to the rubber/steel wheels, I don't think there is an issue there any longer.I have been extremely happy with this compressor. Don't confuse it with a 5HP 60 gallon compressor, but for small to midsize jobs, it performs like a champ!"
4,makita compressor,"I BOUGHT THIS COMPRESSOR FOR AROUND THE HOUSE USE AND SOME CARPENTRY CONTRACT WORK. THIS COMPRESSOR PUTS OUT PLENTY OF AIR TO RUN AS MUCH AS TWO FRAMING GUNS OR ROOFING GUNS IF NEEDED, AND HAS FAST RECOVERY TIME. CAN BE MOVED AROUND EASILY AND CAN BE LOADED IN THE BACK OF A PICKUP BY ONE PERSON IF NESSARY, ABOUT 85 LBS. THEY DO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH SHIPPING. HAD SLIGHT DENT IN TANK AND ONE WHEEL WAS OUT OF ROUND. HAD TO ADJUST WITH HAMMER AND BLOCK. WHEELS COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER QUALITY,MIGHT REPLACE MINE SOME DAY.IN MY OPINION IT'S NOT RUGGED ENOUGH FOR HEAVY COMMERICAL WORK,WOULD NOT BE HARD TO BREAK SOMETHING IF NOT CAREFUL. BUT IT MEETS MY NEEDS."
4,1st shipment arrived damaged; 2nd shipment was fine,"The first Makita Big Bore came pretty banged up on all six sides...and the box was taped together...--- with an oil splotch on one side to suggest somebody dropped it somewhere.After my wife wrote Amazon customer service...--- they promptly (very quickly) sent another compressor, and it arrived in perfect shape.Start up on the model I received required 20-30 minute break in after adding oil...--- but no problem.Some additional thoughts:1) Compressor noise was pleasantly tolerable...much lower than any ""oil-less"" I have had.2) Wheels on this model were very sturdy.3) At 80-90 pounds, and cumbersome, don't expect to ""lift"" this up and down stairs."
1,Hunk of Junk,"Man did I have problems with this unit. I received the first one, which had one wheel with a flat spot on it and the other wobbled so bad I thought it may fall off. Amazon was great and shipped me another unit immediately!(thanks for the great sevice Amazon). The second unit arrived. I took it out of the box and still was disappointed with the wheels. I decided to go ahead and make it work. I brought the unit to my shop and plugged it in. It ran for about 5 seconds and sparks flew out the side of the unit. I sent it back for a refund. I figured with the Makita name, I would be buying a quality tool. Was I ever wrong. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
4,MAC5200,"Kept up with two framing nailers. We had a RIGID that kept overheating and shutting down so we sent it back to the ""Big Box"". We've used the Makita for two framing nailers, two roof nailers, two trim nailers and combinatons of all three ith no problems. The only concerns are the oil can be tough to see in the sight glass and the breaker is tough to reach. The good news is I haven't had to reset the breaker yet. Excellent product."
1,"Poor design, bad workmanship, died quickly","Picked this compressor up for use around the shop with air ratchets and some light construction with air nailers. Like another reviewer mentioned, the tires are wonky: flimsy and prone to being bent. It always seemed that this air compressor never worked right and took a long time to build pressure from the initial break-in period to when the compressor motor finally bit the dust this week. It could only have had about 40 hours of actual usage time on this compressor when it died. The other two Makita tools I own are also of dubious quality. I will not be buying any Makita tools again."
1,Specs,What's with the 3 Horsepower rating? 13.8 Amps at 120 Volts = 1656 Watts. 1656 Watts x 0.00134 = 2.22 Horsepower. There are always some losses at the motor so it is impossible to get more than 2 horsepower optimistically. Why the misleading spec? Makes me wonder what else is misleading about the specs? 1.5 - 2 HP is good for a portable. Why not call it for what it is?
2,bogus motor hp spec,"It's a nice compressor, just did not feel like 3 hp. So, I ran the numbers, and I docked them 2 stars for lying. A bit harsh, but specs should be real.The spec says it draws 13.8 amps. At 120 volts, that comes out to 1650 watts, or 2.2hp.Then they list that it draws 1800W. Wait, that does not add up! But even 1800 watts only comes out to 2.4hp.I guess that most people know that you really can't run a true 3hp motor on a 120V/15A line, but I just didn't stop & think when I bought it.Still, it's a solid 2.2hp compressor, as long as you don't try to start it when it's frozen (it's not oil-less)."
1,Died after 1-1.5 hours,Was filling my air tank and went to check up on this unit and it was dead with a puddle of oil under it...Pros:BeautifulGreat priceCons:Cheap Chinese garbage with a nice paint job and a brand name
5,MAC5200,"I bought a used (like new) machine and it arrived one day later than they said. The package was in terrible shape and had obviosly been dropped.The machine looked new and unused, but the front grab bar was bent and the paint was peeled off. One of the wheels (which are metal) was bent. Neither of these affect the function of the unit which is great. It works well with framing nailers and roofing nailers. It is heavy but very moble whith the wheels. I highly recommend this product."
5,A Fine Home Compressor,"I've been using this compressor for 1 year now. Though some of the early reviews mentioned shipping and wheel damage, I had no such experience. Like many of the newer reviews, it arrived in fine shape so I suspect that the packaging has evolved over time.Initially I bought it to work on a truck with some serious air-sucking impact wrenches. If you're in a closed garage, it can be loud if you're close. Generally it is located across the garage from me, and I just let a 3/8"" air hose lie across the garage floor.Performance has always been spectacular. I suspect I will never need another compressor."
4,Good Product,I am very pleased with this air compressor. The only complaint I have is the plastic wheels. The first day on the job one of mine broke.
5,Great Air Compressor!,"The Makita MAC 5200 is a well designed product, easy to maneuver on the ground with folding handle, hooks for hose storage,two handles on each side for lifting, and a storage compartment for smaller items, which is a real plus.As to the wheels, I see no problem with mine (bought compressor in 4/07). Yes, they have a plastic center, but the tire itself is at least 1/2"" solid rubber and will probably outlast the compressor.A very careful inspection revealed no shipping damage. There was some shroud vibration on startup, quit after the 20 min. break in period.I am very happy with the compressor and would buy an other one without hesitation."
1,If I had to do it again it would not be my first choice.,"I too have several Makita tools and have been very happy with them. This does not live up to the Makita name. It is very loud and pressure does drop considerably before turning back on. My biggest disapointment though was the wheels. You would think that something that takes a beating and is heavy would have nice steardy wheels. Not in this case. They used cheap plastic wheels, I broke one the first day I used it. If I had to do it all over again I would have gone with the Porter Cable. It comes with Pneumatic Wheels and costs less. Live and learn I guess. Will definetly rethink further Makita purchases."
4,"A great and truthful biographical book, wonderfully written","For us admirers of the late Princess of Wales, this book is certainly like a Bible. It is very thourough and painfully eye-opening, especially as it reveals the story of a simple young girl and her very rude - sometimes cruel - awakening to a life where the heart of gold is really as cold as ice. My hat is off to both the Princess and Mr. Morton for having been so courageous."
5,VERY GOOD!,If you need to read just ONE book rehardsing Princess Diana... This is THE one you must pick!You will be delighted with all the details and will admire even more this wonderful person.A book you MUST have on your shelves!
2,SENT IT BACK...,"There must be better books than this one on Diana. I couldn't get past first fewpages and then decided it wasn't worth the read, so I sent it back! Hope to find abetter written one..."
3,Just when you thought you knew all there was about Diana....,"Just when you think you knew everything there was to be known about someone as famous as Diana, along come's Morton's compelling book. It reminds me of ""THE Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth"" by Richard G. Patton in which another figure we all think we know is shown in an entirely fresh and convincing light. Morton shows us the vulnerable Diana we all wept for. I wonder what Jesus would have made of present day media attention and what stories he could swap. The media don't fare well in Morton's study of Diana. Good or bad, this book will always be historically linked with ""the people's Princess"". I enjoyed it very much."
1,Boring book,After reading so many reviews I adventured myself to buy this book for my kindle...what a deception ! it is a very slow and boring book.
4,Good...but got old after awhile,"I bought this book because I'm an American who caught a little royal mania after Kate and Will's wedding and I remember growing up with Diana in the news and even remember where I was when I learned she died. The best part of this book was the author's note where he explains how he was able to get the information from Diana (he would smuggle written questions to her and she would answer them into a tape recorder.) That was fascinating. Then what follows is a transcript of her answering of those questions, again I was enthralled with this emerging, changing public figure. But after that it's the author's putting Diana's words into narrative form, which is fine, but got boring since I already read the ""meat"" and it seemed like just a retelling of what I already read."
1,Talk about use someone.,"Okay, when this book first came out (when Diana was alive), I would have given this book a much higher rating because it was obvious to all of us that she wanted the facts of her life to be known and had given Mister Morton permission to write it. But, I never read it back then. I read it a few months after her death and have to say, although the book was informative and obviously could not have been written without Diana's help, the only reason Morton re-released it with her handwritten notes was to make a buck. He could care less about her tramatic life. She would NEVER have allowed him to openly admit she was behind the book. By making this fact common knowledge, Morton made her look bad to her boys, her family and basically, the world! I thought James Hewitt was a bit on the low side but Morton is an even slimier lowlife in my book!"
2,"Kindle Edition is Not ""Diana: Her True Story""","I thought I was purchasing the book ""Diana: Her True Story"" in the Kindle Format. Instead, this is a transcript of Diana's words, which served as the basis for the book ""Diana: Her True Story"". I feel a little bit misled by this. I think Diana's words are still very interesting, but I wish it was a bit more clear what was being sold. Is there some reason why the book ""Diana: Her True Story"" is not available on Kindle?"
1,Frightfully awful book darling!,"Picked up a copy of this book thingy while I was waiting for my Concorde flight the other day (Bruce and Demi were late, as usual). Poor Di really had a hard time with this Morton chappie, what with the bulimia and the suicide attempts just to avoid the publishing deadlines. Still, it does include some wizard photos of lovely Dodi, and the cover matches my Prada handbag and Gucci phone perfectly! Don't forget to wear your seatbelts, darlings! Those concrete pillars are such a nuisance, aren't they? Mwah!"
5,Diana,"This book is amazing, I was completely hooked on it from the beginning. Andrew Morton does a fantastic job painting the real life of the princess."
2,Just a review of the interview at the beginning of the book,If you read the beginning interview in Diana's words you really don't need to read the book. All Andrew Morton does is rewrite the interview in his words so that it is book length and he added a couple of chapters at the end about the accident that came from the news media. I found it to be depressing.
4,Portable pressure washer,"Just used for the first time, about 2.5 hours on a ~650 square feet patio, which hadn't been cleaned for at least two years. Didn't use detergent or anything, but the difference is incredible. Used the high pressure wand to blast all the filth off, then went back through with the vario wand to rinse it off. The washer didn't have any problems, stalls or hiccups throughout the nearly constant 2.5 hours of use.Very happy with the product considering the price and especially how compact and lightweight it is. It's not a big industrial pressure washer, but it works perfectly for a smallish house, and would be absolutely brilliant for a townhome. It restored my patio, brought my patio furniture back to like-new, and I'm going to use it to wash the car next."
3,Karcher 1400psi compact K2.45,"Similar to the model shown, I bought my K2.45 about 6 years ago. I had been happy with it. It functioned well for the pressure and flow, it does light cleaning well but badly stained concrete cleans very slowly and it won't strip paint.After what I estimate was about 40-60 total hours of use, it started losing pressure and now it only is suitable for very light cleaning.If you buy a similar unit, be aware the pressure hose is fragile- it can be damaged easily by kinking or cross-threading."
1,Garbage,"This was a gift 2 years ago and worked well until last week when I pulled the unit out and discovered that I refused to create pressure. It kind of sputtered about and will not work. I'm never willfully purchasing this brand of washer and advise everyone else to do the same. Save yourself the frustration of another ""Made in China"" product and try to find something made on this continent with a call center not located in India."
2,Plastic trigger failed twice,"Pressure is fine and did the job. Cleaned my sidings, concreate, and deck. Unfortunately, the plastictrigger failed twice (it started to leak and no pressure from the wand). My wife bought a replacement trigger on ebay and that trigger failed (same leakage and no pressure). I tore up one of the bad triggers and the inner plstic tubes cracked and was leaking from it."
5,GREAT COLOR TIGHTS!,Needed true red tights for a special event. Received right away. Fit was perfect and the price was right...the only place to purchase colored tights!
1,Terrible,The description said it would fit up to 200 pounds. I am 165 lbs and these tights did not fit at all. They were too short and definitely a waste of five dollars. No one should buy these because the description of them is wrong and this seller is obviously lying. Thanks a lot. I needed them for a school event too. They don't even deserve a one star rating.
5,Hometown Heroes.,"The Vice Dolls are some of the hardest working people I know. Kudos to Greg, Carrie, Kyle, and Cody; you guys rock."
2,"Cheap, but naff","It sort of works, just. But dreadful quality. OK for a one-off job, but not for regular use. I would buy a more expensive, higher quality tool next time."
2,Poor Quality,"Bought these as an extra pair. Poor quality, they're extremely tight and difficult to open and close, but what do you expect at this price point? It does work, and it doesn't look like it's going to break, so it works well enough."
1,PLEASE Look for another book!,This book isn't worth your time or money. I certainly wasted mine on it. The Author is so caught up in his ability to write code that he forgot what the book is about. No explanations of the code are offered so that you can follow his train of thought. I think he is off in the Delta Quadrant somewhere. The index is next to useless. Try to find 'comments' and you are directed to a page that has the word 'comments' on it but explains nothing regarding adding COMMENTS to your code. Most of his examples don't even work outside his tiny environment - I couldn't make any of them work in my Excel code. Forget troubleshooting your code! His code is so perfect he obviously didn't fell the need to write anything that helps debug your code. The book also lacks an appendix with a list of functions for easy reference. If you want a function your going to spend a huge amount of time flipping through pages. DON'T BUY!
1,Almost Useless,"I have stacks of programming books covering Java and C++. I count this book as one of the two worst books I have ever purchased. I can use either a reference book or a tutorial type book, but I can't use a book that basically recites language attributes without any development or context. It doesn't work as a reference book because it leaves too much information out. There is no value added in this book."
1,Defective Index Destroys Any Value,"I use a book like this mainly for reference on specific points. The index is so defective, however, that the book is almost entirely worthless. (Try looking up ""Shared Workspace task pane"", for example)"
3,"Not a tutorial, not a reference, not sure how to describe it","This book is certainly not a tutorial for a non-programmer. It is also not a VBA reference manual. In fact, I'm not sure how to describe it.The book, while a through and complete collection of information regarding VBA, is probably most useful for individuals already familiar to some extent with VBA and need to extend their knowledge to some specific additional function and or feature. This book is definitely not a ""VBA for Dummies""."
5,Cheaper than anywhere else!,"We've paid 50% higher for this same item for Stamps.com use, no reason not to buy it here!"
3,"Dymo Labelwriter Postage Label, 3-part Internal Postage, 2-1/4""","the labels were not perforated properly, causing a waste because the machine recognizes the perforated lines to stop the printing process.."
2,"Second that! ""Buy the one part labels""","I was either duped by my own lack of research or by the product description for which I've submitted an update suggestion. These labels WILL NOT work with the Dymo Stamps software. You have to use [...] or some other method to make use of these labels. I thought it would be nice to have additional parts to the label, but upon firing up dymo stamps I found that this is not a supported label at all. Dymo Stamps only supports the one part labels. I ended up returning the labels."
4,Our technitions like them better than Stanley Blades,"We have used Stanley blades at least for what WE DO they just don't last long at all, these irwin blades they are getting more time with them so if there happy i'm happy!"
1,horrible,the idea of boy soprano in chorus make it ridiculousthe boys shout and don't singit is corruption of handel
3,"The music could have been done better, but all in all it was olk.",I would look for a better one. This was done in London and I would pick a DVD done in the usa.
3,"Tragic, Enlightening, Erotic, Saddening.","I'm sitting at my keyboard with a blank stare, trying to articulate the impact of this novel on my world view. This was a very intense read for me. Bennet throws everything but the kitchen sink in this book. . .. social, racial, political, religious, sexual (gay/bi?), and moral issues are interwoven throughout the plot. At times the author is actually able to connect some of the dots, tie a few lose threads, but more often than not, the sexual and erotic exploits of the characters overshadows some very serious and at times quite profound social commentary. I'd certainly recommend this book for group reading. . . the more perspectives you get on this one the better. . . ."
3,required reading,received product ontime great item would buy again no problems here. What is the deal with the work requirement to submit ughhh
4,Good to know Lean in practice,"Very good examples and structure...probably need more about other cultures and other industries to apply the concepts.Ones you reed this, you have the concepts and examples"
5,Worth the purchase.,"As an SCM student this book has easy to read chapters with nice sized print. Excellent view on just how Toyota ""did it""."
5,Production line miracles,"The Toyota way fieldbook is an excellent follow up to the first Toyota Way book. The tips and illustrations are helpful in implementing the process onto the production floor. The learning part of the Toyota Way has definately been enhanced by the fieldbook! Great feeling, getting the pages from the book come to life on the assembly line.These remarks come from a production line employee for 16 years."
5,I am picky about comedy so....,So I started watching Father Ted on insomniac Saturday nights here in New Jersey. I decided after the third time I caught it that I wanted to get the complete DVD set. Have not been disappointed so far(except one episode that started great with 8 priests in a lingerie section of a department store).Overall I really enjoy this show and I am sad that Dermot Morgan died after the third season. This was a very funny show and Father Jack Hackett of course... is who I want to be when I grow up...
4,Funny episode,As usual the priests of Craggy Island have a series of silly adventures and then find themselves back where they started from. The episode is worth it for just the first 5 minutes when the persistent Mrs. Doyle brings in tea and cake. That opening scene is hilarious.
2,Cheap,"The chair isn't bad to sit in. Fairly comfortable but is is leather so cold in low temps and sticky in hot temps.The construction of the product is pretty cheap. I've had to tighten screws a couple times. I've had the chair 3 months now and one of the wheel holders (in the star base) has split, so the wheel is loose and if you lean back with that wheel behind you, you'll fall over.There seems to be a weight distribution engineering problem to make a single holder crack. If weight were evenly distributed over the base (properly centered on the lift) this would not have happened.The mechanics work okay. It has a lock (to keep you from leaning back just push the handle in) and the lift functions (though I don't really use it, kind of set it and forget it).I'd recommend paying a little more and getting a product of higher quality. Otherwise, you may have to take the wheels off once it breaks to keep it stable."
4,Good chair,I am a college student and I purchased this chair because it was cheap and look comfortable. Well for $40 bucks I can not complain. It is sturdy and holds up nice. Very easy to assemble and looks all right. The one downside I found is that the seat is flat. So if you are going to be setting in it all day you might want to spend a little more money for a more comfortable chair. This chair fits my needs just fine. I would recommend it to someone that uses the computer for only a few hours a day.
3,Steve Jablonsky does it again...,"While the entire album reflects the pacing and emotion of the film, the last track, ""Ray's Theme"" is the real gem. Much like the movie, the soundtrack builds to it's climax when Ray finally steps into the role of ""hero"" and the music follows suit. I purchased the CD for that final track, but I enjoy the finale much more after listening to the entire score. If you liked the movie you'll like the soundtrack."
5,Cabin on the Prairie,"I loved this book. Could not turn off my Kindle long. This gal was what most of us girls would have loved to have been. High enery and such courage. The book was well written, keeping the readers interest from the first chapter to the end of the book. I was sad to finish it."
2,Not My Style,"I love historical romance novels mostly, but, I read alot from the earlier historical days of 1920's & so on. This book was not quite my style though. It may suit some, so read it & be your own judge. It may not be a totally bad book, but in this case, it's just a matter of personal taste."
5,One of the Greatest Album of the Year!!!,"this album is a blast!!one u start listen to it u can stop dancin,lol,i suggest u should buy this album cuz chocolate rocks!!!agachadita is one the best songs on the album,the rhytem and the bass is awesome..well i guess u r going to get it but im just tellin u ,GET IT NOW!!youll be thankful later..if u wanna start ur party with great music check this album now!!"
2,Stanton DJ Promc MKII,Very convenient as for as microphone and headset is situated. Too much noise if you touch headset while mic is on. does no handle high level well (distortions). Cord is too short. have to remove from head whenever I need to get to my dics or records to my far right or left. thought of returning but will work with it until I can upgrade.
2,"the mic requires high-gain to be audible, but then that creates noise and sensitivity issues","I bought two of these for podcasting / game casting. I'm very unhappy with the microphone quality. I run the mono-end into a high-end mixer and the level bar doesn't light up until the gain is ultra high. Vocals become audible at this level but yeah, noisy hissing, and vibration sensitivity is also.picked-up. @djay husband you filtering and pre-amping this? @othercomment; are you in a dead quiet room? I mean I don't expect them to be exceptional headsets with microphones in them for this price; but I did expect the mono-output plug to produce enough impedance signal without going hyper-sensitive."
5,Happily surprised at quality,"Often times, the more expensive the product, the better the quality. I have to say I was quite impressed with this set of headphones. I used it for live web streaming (calling play by play for sports) and the audio clarity was very good (even if its only mono). Viewers had no problems hearing my audio even when I had to speak in low tones. The ear piece is not the most comfortable in the world (i was using it for the better part of 8 hours) so if plan on using it for an extended period of time (more than a couple of hours) - give your ears a break but other than that - I was quite happy with the purchase and I would buy it again for a second commentator. Until our budget can afford the every expensive broadcast headphones and mics - this did its job and did it well."
3,Noisy!,"Nice switch for the money but I think due to dust in my office the fan bush got clogged and it started making a lot of noise. Had to replace it in about an year just because of the noise.Good interface and very well done software, the gigabit ports were not compatible to some of my older computers though."
1,OBSOLETE TECHNOLOGY -- Must use IE 6.0 or older to manage it!,"The latest firmware for this is 1.2.3.0 dated 11/25/2008. That firmware only allows you to use the WebView management interface with Internet Explorer 6.0 or OLDER.As I expected, Cisco bought LinkSys and totally destroyed their product line so you have to buy Cisco's equipment which costs 10 times as much and requires a CCIP/XYZ certification to be able to figure it out.Also, even if cisco hadn't obsoleted this equipment, they make it nearly impossible to find support for it on their bloated web presence. This is common with all large technology oligopolies that buy up smaller companies: Intel, Cisco, Hewlett Packard, etc."
3,Wonderful Performance for the So-so Musical...,"I agree the performance was outstanding and all the performers did such a great job. The sound/video quality is exceptional. But... the problem is the Bernstein's score itself is not very good. I didn't like the musical very much: no depth and no good melodies... To me, the concert was all about superficial pleasure lacking the essence of true art. With the same effort and time and money, Simon Rattle and BPO could have done more meaningful concert for a better classical work. Life is too short for so-so music!"
3,"C'mon, it's a 3-and-a-half minute song","An enjoyable disc with a couple of caveats. The 5.1 audio settings make the audience sound like it's in a 5-gallon jug. And it was dispiriting and distracting to see Kim Criswell rely on a notebook for the lyrics to ""Conga."""
4,Very useful for lower level students.,"I had this book when I went to language school in Japan for three months and it served me very well. Although it didn't have all of the Kanji I needed to look up, it contained most of them. I didn't do so well at school, but I was able to learn a lot from the book. The best features of the book are it's size, and ease of use. It doesn't take long to look up characters, and the compounds and readings are all written in Kana. It only contains 1006 characters, and when you can't find a character it is disappointing, but otherwise great for something you can slip in a backpack and doesn't weigh a ton. Eventually you'll outgrow the book, but you'll be proud of yourself when you do."
2,A Disappointment,"When I acquired this little book, I was hoping to have something that I could carry around in my briefcase and would help me with newspaper articles and such. It doesn't; it has far too few entries. It never fails to amaze me how there can exist Chinese-English dictionaries the same physical size as this one that contain ten times as many entries as this one does for Japanese. Can't anybody make a good compact Japanese-English Kanji dictionary?"
5,THIS CD IS A MUST,"I CAN'T STOP WRITING RAVE REVIEWS ABOUT PERCY FAITH. IF THERE WERE NO OTHER GOOD SONGS ON THIS CD, ""MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS"" WOULD BE ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS A MUST HAVE. HOWEVER THERE ARE OTHER GREAT SONGS AS WELL. ""BRIAN'S SONG"", ""SONG SUNG BLUE"", ""THE FIRST TIME EVER I SAW YOUR FACE"". ALL FOUR OF THE ABOVE SONGS WERE PLAYED ON EASY LISTENING FM RADIO STATIONS BACK IN THE 70'S ND 80'S."
5,LOVES IT,I absolutely LOVE IT!!! Wish there were more Seasons. Such a shame for CBS to cancel a brilliant show!
4,I just like it,I don't know I just like this show. I was disappointed when the show got canceled and I love the fact that I could find it on dvd.
5,Excellent,My granddaughter wanted these DVD's for Christmas and I had a hard time finding them in stores. As usual Amazon came thru for us! Thanks Amazon!
3,Not as strong as the first season,"The first season was original and compelling. This second season doesn;t come ñup to the same level. Some of the story lines seem a bit contrived, as though the writers are running out of ideas. It still manages to show religious faith in a positive light and point the moral compass in a values-oriented direction. The acting is excellent."
4,A shame it's gone,The second season was in some ways better than the first. The last episode really set the scene for a great third season. It's a shame it didn't happen. Great show. Too bad that TV has gotten so bad that I have to resort to buying old dvds.
4,"Joan of Arcadia, 2nd season",Love the portrayal of God being so accessible and real and practical. Actors all excellent in spite of the challenge of late 20 year-olds pretending to be high school students. Overall this was a special TV series that brought light into a medium with no shortage of darkness.
5,Joan of Arcadia-Season Two,A fine series! Gave us God in everyday life lessons for young people. What a shame it is no longer on the air. Watch the two seasons and enjoy!Joan of Arcadia - The First Season
2,too basic lessons and just two songs,"This video has very basic lessons and just two songs:-Cerca del mar and-Por una mujer casadaboth songs have mistakes while teaching. The last song, por una mujer casada, never teaches the end of the song. If the notation where included, it will helps a lot."
2,Good track selection... terrible sound quality.,"I've been a fan George Acosta for a long time now, having bought every one of his albums. I do like the track selection and the way he mixes it but I have to say, the sound quality on this album is very poor. There are several times throughout the CD where there is static, hissing, crackling and just plain distortion. I know live DJ sets are straight from vinyl so record static is to be expected, but this goes way beyond that. There was obviously a major breakdown somewhere during the post production of this album. I have a lot ot these types of albums in my music collection and I have never heard one this bad. At times you have to skip to the next track the distortion is so bad. Big ups to George for his mixing of these tracks, but thumbs WAY DOWN for the production of this album. Someone should have caught this major problem before it was mass produced and released to his fans worldwide."
2,What Happened?,Some of the tracks are good but for the most part this is the worst George Acosta output. There is no self being to the release at all. Never takes you to another level. Mixes are ok. And there is the most annoying hissing and static that shouldn't appear on Professional CDs. I mix my own Vinyl and I don't get that hissing after recording to a CD.
4,A Departure to Symphonic Trance,"This is a good piece of work from our local favorite son, George Acosta. It is very melodic and uplifting....disk 1 is almost like a symphony of trance.....the scores build and crescendo much like a powerful syphony score. This 2 cd set is great for driving, chilling, relaxing, but lacks the intensity of his live performances, or the power dance tracks found on ""Next Level"" or even ""AM"" (my personal favorite). If you love George and his work you will ""like"" this but it won't stay in your player round the clock. The tracks on this one have appeared on either the Black or White Gatecrasher chill disks from last year and some will recognize some of the other tracks as well. George isn't really breaking new ground here but the music has a spiritual feel to it that makes up for its shortcomings. Buy it if you like melodic trance and all things Acosta !!!"
1,"BUYER BEWARE: great trance, VERY BAD sound quality","The music is great, but BEWARE, the sound quality on this CD equates to the worst professional recording I have ever heard. Not only is there hissing and popping, which is already barely acceptable, but very LOUD persistent static on synth tracks in several places and heavy distortion of certain vocals (sort of like the distortion you get from yelling about 1/4 inch from a mic) -- Very annoying, I am going to guess over *20%* distortion in places. I cannot believe such a thing would ever be released. Embarrasing for Ultra Records and GA. Too bad, because it is actually an awesome compilation of trance."
2,This guy is known for good epic trance...but this one fails,"The track selection and remixes by George Acosta is just ok not too great though. Its a double disc album and one cd is labeled ""Epic"" and CD two is labeled ""Darc Side"". When both of them actually don't sound much different from the other. He has some banging tracks but a majority of them just bangs a bit and then slows down. Nothing memorable. Except for Gouryella Ligaya which got so much hype but it's really not that great. To this date, George Acosta's best release is ""Next Level"". Check that out."
4,"Great trance mix, but read this...","I love this mix. I just bought it and can't stop listening to it. It's pure trance all the way through, a few vocals here and there but not enough to make it sound cheesy, just perfect.The beats and the pace are constant. I have other Acosta's records and this one is just as good!But, here is my little complaint, and the same as everyone. Someone dropped the ball sound-wise with this. You hear lots of hiss during play of both cds, on some tracks more than others. I know these mixes are made from vinyl, but so are the majority of the ones I have on cd and they don't have the amount of noise & hiss that this cd has.I mean, you can concentrate on the music, but if your ears are picky you will notice it. It's not THAT bad to stop you from buying this set. Go and get it for the good music."
1,Sound quality so horrible it's not worth listening to,I have to say I love George Acosta. The first time I listened to this album I thought there was something wrong with the cd. Eventually I figured out this was how the cd was actually produced. I have dj'd before and understand that some of my records might sound bad from wear and tear but I couldn't believe the horrible sounds coming from my speakers when playing this album. Get ANY of his other cd's besides this one!
5,Fabulous!!!!,"Hi there!I was fortunate enough to access this CD from a good friend of mine- for free- what a dude!One thing I can say- even if you have to purchase this CD- do it right now-- Acosta does a great up-lifting session here- with pure erotic trance intermixed wtih harder sounds- The results are fantastic!! I have burned this CD for three friends- all state that it is probably one of the best trance albums out there. In fact, this CD parallels scott stubbs'- trance vertgio.Have a nice time listening- it's quite an experience.Peace-dave"
1,VERY UNFORTUNATE,"I completely agree with everyone else about this cd. The music on this album is some of the best I have heard from George. The tracks are nothing but pure hard hitting energy that would make anyone want to dance. However, the sound quality is terrible!!! It would be nice if the company would redub the album and improve the sound quality as it should be so that we can enjoy it the way we would listening to any other cd."
5,Well made & comfortable,These boots are made of a very nice grade of leather. The height is just right--stylish but comfortable. Order a half size up to accomodate socks!
5,"GREAT VOICE, GREAT SONGS!!!!","ONE IF NOT THE BEST FROM THIS SPANISH SUPERSTAR.ROMANTIC, POEM LIKE LYRICS. POWERFUL VOICE AND INTERPRETATION.EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE ANY OF HER RECORDS. SHE'S A CLASSIC."
5,"DE LA PLUMA DEL AFAMADO COMPOSITOR ARGENTINO ROBERTO LIBI, LLEGA ISABEL PANTOJA CON SU GRAN ARTE Y VOZ!!","EL FAMOSO COMPOSITOR ARGENTINO ROBERTO LIVI, TRAE ESTAS ROMANTICAS CANCIONES EN LA VOZ DE LA PANTOJA, UN HERMOSO DISCO, MELODIAS LLENAS DE VIDA, AMOR Y DESAMOR, CON TODO UN ARTE DE ESPANA, ISABEL PANTOJA."
4,"Great Keyboard, but be warned","This Keyboard is excellent, feels tough and simple.How ever be warned that the software that comes with this keyboard has almost no piano soundfonts and you have to find a 3rd party program or upgrade Ableton Live which is costly."
2,NO 64 BIT SUPPORT,"I was extremely excited when the keyboard came in... until I ran into audio software problems. I run windows xp 64-bit and although windows itself can recognize the device as a ""usb audio device"" my audio production software cannot recognize it. (Reason, Cubase)Checked the M-audio website for any updates, drivers, and etc but they currently do not support 64bit at all, though their website claims that for vista 64 bit users, plug and play should be sufficient. After googling around for a couple hours, it became evident that based on the general response from other 64-bit users, M-Audio is absent from supporting systems that want to utilize more than 2+ gb of RAM.Unfortunately, I will have to return this product.64 bit USERS BEWARE!!!!"
2,a little tricky,"after investing another $40 in a special cable, I was finally able to hook up the keyboard to the computer. It would not sound through my speakers no matter what I did. I could only hear it through headphones and the delay was about three seconds between pressing a key and it registering a sound. This became increasingly annoying. In the end, I sold this and bought a normal digital keyboard."
2,"Good keyboard, but terrible instruction and customer service","The size and weight of the keyboard just like the real piano, I like it. If you are computer wiz, know how to configure audio file and look for better price on full size keyboard, then this is the one for you, otherwise, do not buy it, because the keyboard doesn't play sound, you must use your computer to output each key's sound, and there are no any detailed instructions in the start menu how to configure the audio sound and export sound files, and online technical support also lack of step by step instructions, to reach a live customer support is impossible. I finally got an email back after more than a month, but it didn't tell me any instruction, just told me log on their website check out frequent questions/answers. I ended up returned the product."
1,Ugh no idea how to get it to work,"Very beautiful keyboard but HOW does it work?! Got the thing, downloaded the software for sound, plugged keyboard in and...nothing. The instruction manuel was a joke, had my dad help me try to figure it out...still didn't work. It didn't help at all, so then we tried searching on the Internet. Nothing. Called the help number written on the back of the instruction manuel and spent forever waiting on hold then after following the guy on the line's instructions to set up the midi the darn thing still wouldn't play a darn note. Eventually we just gave up and sent the thing back and got a refund. Instead we bought the CasioCDP100 love it and wished we'd done that earlier. If you'd had a midi controller before and know how to work them, buy this. If not and you're a beginner like I was don't too much stress."
3,"""semi-weighted"" an issue for an 88 key controller","I'm not sure what 'semi-weighted' action means technically, but it feels more springy. This means when the key is pressed down, there is more pressure required to keep it pressed than either a hammer action (modified or not) or a synth action. This can be very tiring on a gig, and some articulations can get pretty sloppy. If you really need 88 keys on the cheap, this is the only one out there. But if you need 88 keys, you're probably either gigging or recording classical to MIDI (in which case articulation matters), so beware."
1,Product No Longer Supported by Manufacturer!,I tried to get help when my 61es stopped working. The company has been bought out and this instrument is no longer supported! The company is not honoring the warranty! Buyers beware!
3,Very nice for the price.,"I got this to play my laptop's virtual synths out live. Keys are surprisingly solid and the action is decent. You can't expect hammer-type action (I've got the Studiologic in the studio for that), but this is better than synth action for piano sounds.It is *very* light, which is a real plus for me as I want it for live gigs.At this price, it's a good bargain. Octave +/-, Transpose +/- (Perfect for me as we tune down a half step); pitch bend, mod wheel and volume slider are all user assignable. I don't make any use of the Program Change features, so I can't comment on those."
3,"not great, but not bad for 200 bucks...","easy setup with my Mac, and works seamlessly with Garage Band. i have noticed that sometimes F2 makes the sound of F3 if i don't hit it hard enough. the description says ""semi-weighted,"" but even with theM-Audio SP-2 US65010 Sustain Pedal Piano Style Sustain Pedal for Keyboardsthe action still makes it very hard to be expressive and vary your dynamics, especially if you're used to playing weighted keys or a real piano. still, it feels a lot better than most inexpensive keyboards, for 88-keys--the price can't be beat, and Amazon delivered it on time."
5,M-Audio Keystation 88ES +,"I must say (are the first two 1 star reviews true) I can not imagine describing myself as 1) Professional 2) Pianist/Composer and then spending less than $200.00 or so and complaining about a power supply (or lack of) and that latency is a issue (I have heard that Windows versus Mac there is more ""latency"" but in mili seconds with USB 2.0 and MIDI (are You upset a Cable (MIDI) was not included, I ""think"" a MIDI out at least port is on the Keystation 88es ?Puzzled and are these really Pros, Pros use Pro equipment and this is 88 keys but its not advertised at at a Pro Level MIDI Keyboard, read up more, researach helps, measure twice and cut onceSorry if You find this offensive I found the reviews hilarious!"
4,width is wrong,"Beware, the width announced by M-Audio at 53"" is erroneousIt is actually 54""I had to send mine back since it was too wide for my composer desk."
3,One of the few books about a male multiple,"Simply because this is about a male--a subsection of multiples rarely given any attention to--it is worth reading. While not written in novel-style, it still manages to tell the story in a gripping way. However, this book does not promote a great image of multiplicity to the world. It lumps us in with common criminals or those too ill to regulate their own actions. And this is NOT the norm. A good story on its own, but not a great moment for the community. One has to wonder, though... what happened to Milligan since?"
4,Different aspect to MPD,"I thought this book was very interesting. It has been the only book that I have read that in details had the effects of abuse as what to do for the crimes comitted by a ""a self"" but not by the host.It put two subject together MPD and criminal law. This book shows the way that MPD can cause different affects of MPD meaning how host and ""self"" deal with temper. But what can be done if a ""self"" did the crime but not the present self? I am glad that I took the time put to read this book. If you are interested in this subject like I am it is worth it."
1,i was never convinced Milligan wasn't faking,"to me Milligan comes across as an ego-maniac fraud. i believe he had an abusive childhood and that he is a sociopath, but i believe he just learned to act and manipulate people. he is a serial rapist and armed robber. i hope he is cured, but i believe he is a con man who has created quite a scam for himself."
4,A different read about MPD,"As with any work of non-fiction, we should allow ourselves to believe as much or as little as we wish to what the author(s) has to reveal in the story. I found this book to be an extraordinary account of the life of a young man living with MPD and the struggles he faced both personally and in society.Although the crimes Billy committed while under alter peronalities are unexcusable, it's both sad and appalling to know that the justice system in this country can be so cruel.The conclusion left me wanting to know more of what Billy's life may be like today. Unlike other books about MPD where the so-called victims receive a great deal of therapy to mesh their different personalities into one, this book offers a different end to perhaps becoming whole.For anyone interested in MPD, this is a great read to add to his/her library."
3,No cover?,"Nowhere in the description did it say that this book was missing it's dust jacket. Nevertheless, I am pleased with the purchase."
4,A minor classic deserving of attention,"A hundred years after the novel is set, the contrast between Chicago and Nebraska still rings true. Having lived in both places, I admire Cather's abiltiy to show the readers the strengths and weak points of each setting. Lucy is so in tune with her surroundings that the settings act almost as characters.My book discussion group is reading ""Lucy Gayheart"" because we've all read the ""major"" Cather works. We chose this one because none of us knew anything about it. It will never be considered one of her great works, but it certainly can stand against the works of many other writers. Cather delicately touches on the subjects of change as a part of leaving home and growing up, the yearning for what is ethereal and lovely, and the difficulty & loneliness of creating a life as an artist."
3,not madden or espn,yes gameday is fun but if your used to madden or any other game i suggest u stay with it these controls are a little differnt and hard to pick up its fun and the gameplay is fast but i would just stick with madden
3,NO Madden.,This game is good. But it had no competition with Madden. Madden is simply better than Gameday. The cover should have have another player. Ladainian Tomlinson is Madden material.
5,NFL Gameday 2004,"this game rocks,graphics r awesome,alot of improvements,game got a nice sound track,best online features on any football game period,live sports ticker,message boards,email other players,u can use ur headset,play 2 vs 2 online,1 person host game while 3 other players join.game is pretty kool,should check it out.only problem iv notice is when u play online,da defence seems to b kinda weak,u really got to know what ur doing to play good D,i give game 5 stars cuz its fun to play,very fast pace game,big hits,amazing catches"
4,Good intoduction to Croatian history,"A book that needs to be read, if only for the shedding of light on Croatian history, which for too long was hidden or re- written by others. Putting aside his conclusions to the recent war, which seem to arose most criticism, he has written an even handed history of Croatia since early times, although sometimes he fails to place Croatia in its historical context, as a small nation in the greater general upheavals of Europe. Even so, Tanner has relied on many varied sources, not just myths created since the Second World War by both Western and East European historians, which many Western historians are now acknowledging as myths, half tuths or deceptions, of which Tanner is one."
4,"Good, but Simple","Tanner is neither a Croatian nor an academic, and this limits the book in both understanding and the depth of its research. And yet, the book is successful all the same. It is a quick and accurate overview of Croatia's long and complicated history. Useful for those new to the region and its issues. Some of Tanner's conclusions (particularly those for the most recent events) are decidedly pro-Croat nationalist (unabashed support for Tudjman and the HDZ), and the still-important WW2 events are not carefully considered. But overall, it is a good, if simple book. You may want to complement it with Goldstein's history as well."
3,"Seems Good, But Hard To Tell!","My fiancee and I were both really eager to read this book, we'd heard good things about it and are planning a trip to Croatia. Unfortunately, it's so poorly typeset that it's a real struggle to read! We both got about 15-20 pages into it and just couldn't continue, we were getting headaches (no joke). The problem is that the text is just too densely set, there's no breathing room whatsoever. Yale Press has a done a real disservice to the author."
5,Excellent Mix CD,"I have to say that this is one of the best mix Cds I have purchased in a long time. I never heard of Marcus and Dominique, but I read a review of this Cd in NME last month and they gave it a great review. I looked for it in a few shops and had no luck, so i ordered it from Amazon.com. Its has some really good tracks especially the mix between Bushwaka and Tiefscwartz is AMAZING! I listen to it every day, and leave it in the CD player in my car."
5,sweet,"Never heard of these guys until I was at Centro-Fly in New York a couple months ago and they rocked it. So when I saw the CD I picked it up on a whim. Lately all the mix CDs I've listened to have been pretty whack. This one however is very tight - you can tell it was mixed live and there are a lot of great tracks on it. Pretty eclectic too. I love the Tiefswarz song, Paul Johnson track, and the DJ Sneak cut. the Plant track is awesome too."
4,A book that needed to be written,"The author provides a warts and all portrait that nonetheless conveys her great respect and admiration for her subject. The catalog of performances is encyclopedic, but is useful in placing certain live recordings in context for his early career development. I was lucky to have heard him in most of his leading roles at the Met during the late 60s and 1970s. Reading how singers experienced sharing the stage with him, confirmed that I was not alone in feeling that this was an artist who always went out on a limb with the emotional intensity he invested in his roles. For many, including myself, he is one of a handful of great singing artists of the last century."
3,Best bass. Worst treble.,"Have these speakers 8 years now. I stopped using the satellites due to just about non-existing hi frequencies/treble, & replace them with ""regular"" bookshelf speakers. I will NOT give up the sub for anything. The LOWS/BASS that this sub puts out is simply rarely matched. (Just place them properly next to a wall: vent facing out, opposite end of vent next to the wall.) I have certain passages of certain sounds I use to test speakers. The ONLY other sub I've heard at anytime, & at any price, that puts out this (what I call ""deep, booming"") lows, is the sub of the Boston Acoustics Subsat 6 (but this is NOT a ""computer set"", & it's NOT powered.) Recently bought the Corsair sp2500, due to the ""rave"" reviews, but was quite disappointed with the bass & treble."
5,Beware,"Beware of reading this book. In it's pages are the ability to change a mans life. Leonard Ravenhill is best summed up as a man on fire for one thing...to change a nation. He burns with the passion of Elijah the Prophet to see America return to God on her face.This book never seems to age or maybe what it says is true and prophetic. Get the book, read it, and you decide."
5,The best analysis of Java Core Fundamentals,"This is the most valuable text u can find about how to understand the fundamentals, the principles and to where look, when Java begins to change (AWT, another OO methodologies, etc). Bruce makes u see shining what we take a lot of time to understand, testing, debugging, and using all Java flavors. with this reading, u'll be able to change your RAD, your platform and your environmente easyly. And I discovered all of that just reading the on-line version :)"
1,Proof that Programmers can't write,"I used this book for a Java course. Although the book covers all aspects of Java in great detail, it was one of the most poorly written computer books I've ever read (and I've been a programmer for 20 years). In Eckel's description of applets and the AWT, not one picture or illustration was shown. In addition, he uses large blocks of code to show an example of the use of certain Java features, which often means you have to read two pages of code listings to get to the example. In addition, he refers to features of Java in some chapters that he hasn't discussed, and tells you it will be covered later. As a final point, he keeps telling you to read the API documentation for more detail. If you have to read the API for more information, what's the point in reading his book! Do yourself a favor and get another Java book; you'll be glad you did."
2,Not even speaking Java let alone Thinking it!,This book is confusing and long winded. I had heard that this book would be good for someone with a C programming background. Not true. I think the author got caught-up in the competition to write the biggest book on a particular subject.
3,Useful 2nd Java resource,"When I initially picked up the book I thought ""wow"" this book investigates parts of Java that many other introductory/intermediate books fail to cover. I still use it now to give me further insight into various aspects of Java which I am a little unclear on. Where I think this book fails is in providing clear and concise examples that you can use and apply. If I need an immediate solution to a problem this is one text that I won't use."
2,"terrible, not for beginners, must know C++","I knew C and C++ so I bought this book. No beginner could ever understand the first chapters. He starts with the most complicated C++ concepts and then moves to the code. You don't see a program until the 5th chapter. No creativity (all in black and white, NO color). The only good chapter is the chapter on buttons,text boxes, etc. If I didn't already know C++ I would have been completely clueless. Do not try to use as a teaching textbook; this book is for reference only."
1,Long and bloated treatise,"I was forced to buy this book for a college course I'm taking on Java. The book is long winded in the extreme at more than 1,000 pages (not a good thing). The writing style is chatty to the point of sounding like the entire thing was done by dictation.Lots of unhelpful comparisons are provided along the way to Smalltalk, C++, and even FORTRAN. Lots of long dull example programs aren't even worth skimming. A typical example shows every possible combination of scalar type promotion. Not dull enough? Well how about the one which exercises every single operator on every single scalar type. You get the ideaThe sad part is that I have personally attended Bruce Eckels one and two-day workshops at Software Development Conference and found him to be a concise and coherent speaker in real life."
5,Great Reference for Experienced Object-Oriented Progrmmers,"It is a comprehensive Java book about the language itself, not JDK. It talks nothing about how to use any IDE or how to organize your source code and things like that. This book assumes you know how to compile and run Java in your environment and focus only on the language.The book is conprehensive enough that covers almost everything in Java language in all aspects and even move towards design pattern. Each chapter precisely touches the topic with easy to follow sample codes. Key points of object-oriented language are emphasized and highlighted into different chapters, which is especially good for programmers who know exactly what they're looking for. Beginers might feel the book a little fragmented."
4,A must read for anyone new to Java,Very readable book with lots of examples and useful pointers for any new Java programmer.
1,TOTALLY lacking in depth. For the beginning programmer ONLY.,"I found this book nearly useless, with almost no coverage of advanced concepts that the professional developer needs to know about soon after getting started. I heard this book was good for OO development but found even chapters related to objects severely retarded. The author can't seem to write without attempting numerous unamusing anecdotes and other dry humor that have little to do with the material being presented. The coverage is light on virtually every subject. This book should only be considered by people not only new to Java but programming in general. It would be a good idea to learn speed reading as well since there's a lot of fluff. (I sent this book back, it didn't belong with the dozens of other java titles I have on my shelf.)"
3,Not for professionals,"English is my second language. Reading Bruce's book has been a bit difficult for me as one of the reviewer had said below, the content is ""chatty""; it is unlike usual technical writing that I get very used to. To be harnest, I am a Java evangelist who dislike C++ very much. However I found Stroustrup's ""The C++ Programming"" to be well written by comparing to the style of this book. To be picky, I have recommended to the author that the drawings in all his books to be considered ugly. Lastly, I am still thanksful to him for making the downloadable versoin of this title available."
3,"A useful, if long-winded, book","I found the book OK in most areas, and its certainly pretty comprehensive on all the relevant areas of Java. However, I found the unnecessary comentary in the background annoying, and didn't like the way some subjects were handled, or not handled as the case may be (eg. GridBagLayout). The examples were also a little hard to follow, perhaps because they were not explained in enough detail in the early chapters. I came to the end of the book still struggling to write some simple code ! Nice try."
3,THE BOOK IS GOOD BUT BORING AND LITTLE PRACTICAL,"If you already know OO concepts and you come from a language as C++, this book is very boring. The book is not schematic and it is diffucult to re-find the concepts read. The language syntax must be take from the examples."
2,I should've listened to the bad reviews for this book...,"Before I bought this book I read many of the reviews. Many were bad, Many were good. I decided it's worth the risk. It's not really a bad book, but definetly not a good one, either. It's very difficult to read, the examples are the worst possible, perhaps, to illustrate the ideas presented. After reading almost half the book I gave up, and I'm going to buy another book."
5,This is really a good one!,"Thinking in JAVA is *THE* JAVA tutorial: it covers all the aspects of the language and of object oriented programming and it is very pleasant to read. Maybe the author repeats some concepts too many times, but may be a virtue. ;-)"
3,Good but unclear at crucial points,"I must say that I really enjoy Bruce's style, but I'm not sure I totally agree with the other suggestions. Bruce leaves out some critical detail in places where it counts. For instance: if I were an intro-level programmer, and I was wondering how to write, compile, and run my first program, here is how Bruce suggests I go about it: ""Compile the program with javac and run it using java"" Wow...just a minute, how,what,when and where? Although he goes into a lot of detail on some things, I was left pondering many others. I would say this is a great book on the whole, but NOT for a beginner. Bruce uses examples for showing the upper and lower limits of variable sizes with hex notation...if you don't understand how hex works, your not going to understand it in this book. If I could recommend any changes to the book, I would suggest a little more time on the basics and less focus on abstraction."
1,Don't waste your money,"Bruce Eckel wrote one my favorite book - ""Thinking in C++"". The book was succinct and explained the concepts very well. Making the leap to Java I decided to pick up ""Thinking in Java"". I suppose if I knew nothing about programming and had all the time in the world I would have had gotten more out of it. However if you know C, and especially C++, pick up Java in the Nutshell (3rd Ed). Java in Nutshell is a lot faster to go through and you will get more out of it than this book.Besides being long winded it is also tries to be a comprehensive ""bible"" for Java. The problem is that the sections on swing don't have the depth to tackle real world projects. So you will end up picking up books on specific Java systems anyway.Java is changing fast and by the time you get through this there will be two new versions out there. Read Java in a Nutshell and you will be ready to go in less than half the time."
3,Very good book to learn the Java language.,"This is a very good book to learn the Java language. If you are a beginner, however, you may get a little lost as there isn't a single graphical illustrations."
5,i could play again!,"the multitap/adapter is cool. my second slot in my ps2 didn't work. now i could play 4 player on some of my games like ratchet and clank: up your arsenal, downhill domination, and tekken tag. on the mutltitap you can have up too 4 controllers and 4 memory card slots. if you buy 2 multitaps, you can have up to 8 players. get this if you want 4 players."
5,Amazing Fun for Extra Multiplayer Fun!!!,"Must have for PS2 owners who love playing with others, especially with more than 2 players. MUST HAVE!! Get the Multi-Tap!!HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!"
4,Great for partys.,"I bought this knowing it may not work on my ps2.According some forums there is different models of multitaps for diffrent models of systems.But it worked great and it even work on one of my friends ps2 witch is a diffrent model from mine.I got to try out some games with some friends and we had a blast.Now my friend needs to get his own so we can have some four on four fifa tournaments.The only problem I had with it is that its a bit hard to connect it to the ps2,but other than that it works like a charm.Know I just need to go get some more multitap compatible games and I will be ready to go.Anybody know any good ones?"
3,Multiplayer Fun!,"This PS2 item allows you to play up to four players,which is much more fun then just having a two player games. Of course the multitap is no use if you don`t have 3-4 controlers or if you don`t have a PS2 game that allows 3-4 players in,such as Agent Under Fire or Super Bombad Racing. I would have gladly rated this item a 5,but it doesn`t allow you to play multiplayer PS1 games on your PS2. But otherwise it`s fun to play with, and theres even slots for 4 memory cards!"
3,Multi-tap clash,"I was very disappointed to find that the old multitap will not work with the new design of the PS2. The design is different...so its not compatible, but I am having a hard time finding the new multitap, even though according to the Playstation.com website, it was released on Nov. 1. I don't even know the difference in appearance. Its just another way for them to make money...they came out with the same system in a new design...and you have to buy all new things. They are beginning to become to much like the computer industry...*sigh*"
4,More than 2 Players? You Need It!,"Putting aside the debate as to whether or not the PS2 SHOULD have included more controller ports, one needs to accept the fact that it only comes with 2.I like the MultiTap in that it is made by SONY itself, and is both reliable and durable. I only give it 4 stars because the short cord makes it difficult for those of us who prefer to have our PS2 stored on the second shelf of a cabinet (I have to put a small table underneath to keep the weight of the MultiTap from damaging the input slot).I would have preferred either a plug in piece that adheres to the front of the PS2 (perhaps uding both controller ports for support) or a much longer cord. As it stands now, I may have to buy a controller extension cord to correct this design flaw, which is irritating when I already paid for the MultiTap.It works, it's first party, and it's reliable. Hopefully the PS3 will take advantage of the wireless revolution and the cord issue will be a thing of the past!"
4,Great item From heartless company,"This Item is great,but why wasn't it made backward compadible playstation 1. I mean if the dual with the playstation or shock 2 is compadible why isnt the multi tap.The 2nd fault is that the cord is so short if your ps2 is not positioned on the floor it has a danger of falling out."
4,(...),All my Friends (exept me I was smart to get Gamecube) have ps2 my friends went to play it with me and we play PS2 we need to take turns playing cause the STUPID MULTITAP my friend doesnt have it Im glad he didnt they break easy they bearly work and are EXPENSIVE so I wanted to invite my friens over to have a BLAST with GAMECUBE!!! Note PS2 suck hard at MULTIPLAYER games anyway they dont have much get GAMECUBE if you want good MULTIPLayer Games.
4,Multiplayer action!,"The multitap is an easy way to play with more than 2 players on the playstaion 2. The multitap has up to 4 controler and memory card slots, but it turns out that I dont use this adapter as much as I thought I would, because I dont constantly have people over at my house when I could use it. And if I do have people over I only have one person over at a time so i dont even need to use the multitap. I have had no porblems with the multitap and overall it is very usefull and I enjoy using it."
3,"Actually, the PSX Multitap works with PS2","I haven't used this multitap, but I want to correct what some other person said about the older PSX Multitap. The old one does work with PS2. I have used my old one with old games and new games, such as Midnight Club. Anyway, have fun gaming."
3,playstation2 multisystem,have you idea how modified to a multisystem cause I am living far from you(out sea) tks to anwser quickly! SORRY FOR MY ENGLISH
4,5 is better then 2,"With the Multitap for the PS2, you can have five people play games. Most PS2 games only allow 1 or 2 players, but the few games that allow four or more make this little accessory worthwhile. With a Multitap you can store 5 memory cards.The majority of the games with Multitap capability are sports games. Some of the highest rated games that are Multitap compatible include Gauntlet Dark Legacy, NBA LIVE 2002, NHL 2002, Madden 2002, TimeSplitters, Quake 3 Arena - Revolution, ATV Off Road, Unreal Tournament, and DOA2.[...] The Multitap is not backward Compatible with PS1 games. Hopefully the price will drop and more games will be built for multiplayer. Another problem is some games require the Multitap be plugged in slot 1 or 2 specifically, requiring moving it for different games.I would only recommend getting this if you have the money, games and guests to make the most of it! It's a blast for parties or the family gatherings!"
1,DOESN'T WORK ON ALL PS2,"IF YOU HAVE A PS2 MORE THAN 2-3 YEARS OLD, THIS MULTITAP WON'T WORK!!DON'T BUY IT UNLESS YOU HAVE THE CHANCE TO TRY IT FIRST.THIS MULTITAP WON'T FIT ON YOUR OLD PS2 AND YOU WILL BE PISSED JUST LIKE ME."
3,"Great for PS2 games, Warning about PS1 games","This is a must have to have your friends join you in playing PS2 games, but guess what. PS games need a different multitap. Games like bomberman and Crash Team Racing need the ps1 multitap to have multiplayer functionality. ... I figure they would have made things TOTALLY backward compatible but they didn't. The PS1 adapter will plug into the PS2, but it is not suppose to work with PS2 games. You need to buy the 2 different multitaps if you intend on playing PS1 and PS2 multiplayer games on the PS2 system."
3,Why not just get a cheeper one.,The Multitap for PSOne also works for the PS2 and it is five dollars less.
5,What's the Point of Not Having a Multitap,"- Although I haven't bought the PS2 nor the multitap yet, I still think what's the 'fun' without the multitap. Of course you can play by yourself or with another person, but what's the point of taking turns on a multiplayer game where you could all play together."
4,SUPERMAN!!!!,I bought this for my husband. He was really surprised and seems to really like all the info that this book contains.
3,"Comic History Only, Not Movies/TV","The trouble with comic book characters is that their ""history"" has been rewritten/rebooted so many times that a definitive record is impossible. While this book tries its best, it is clearly based on Superman's comic book history rather than the movies/TV shows, so thinking otherwise may lead to disappointment.Basically, if you are looking to read this book because you caught Christopher Reeve's Superman portrayal on DVD or are a huge fan of Smallville, please look elsewhere, as this text doesn't cover those subjects whatsoever.That being said, this guide is very good at what it does, that being telling the multiple comic book history of Supes. So, it just depends on what you are looking for."
3,Though colorful...has a grey shadow over it,"For a person who grew up with the man of steel, this guide was supposed to be his bible. But unfortunately, the grey side to this seemingly colorful book is that it is more objective than subjective. Turning the man of steel into a historical figure(even though he IS a historical figure). It basically states out the facts which have transpired in Supermans life and is almost similar to reading my history book in highschool. To a Superman fan, this guide might prove to be a disappointment but if you just need to know what big ""S"" has been doing all throughout these years, this book will do it for ya!"
2,I guess it's okay--if you like the newer Superman.,"I should have read some of the earlier reviews on this Website. This book may serve fans of the newer Superman, but it does little for the fans of the older Superman.Superman comics lost my readership in 1970, when everything turned bigger and shinier. Except for the first 7 pages of the chronology in the back, this book deals exclusively with the additions to the Superman legend which have taken place then. The illustrations and the text are supposed to impress the reader with how great Metropolis is, what a giant corporation LexCorp is, and how terrifying the villains are.I would gladly trade in all this hyperbole for the writing style of the earlier writers."
4,Gregg Avedon as Superman,"I've always been a fan of Superman and the integrity by which he lives in spirit for all of us to aspire to. This book is a nice introduction to Superman and the story behind the man of steel. On a side note about the upcoming Superman film which is being directed by Brett Ratner: I've seen cover model and aspiring actor Gregg Avedon over the years, knowing he would make the perfect man of steel. This is the opportunity for America to realize their favorite superhero in physical form at a time when the words ""Truth, Justice, and The American Way"" mean more than ever. I certainly hope Gregg gets the opportunity. Back to the book: I would certainly reccommend this overall simple guide to anyone who wants to have cliff notes packed together in one simple, well illustrated, and affordable book."
5,Rockin'/ Hell Bent For Leather,"Frankie Laine at his best!! Perfect for anyone who loves the ""old"" music!"
4,Hell Bent Enjoyment,"Mr. Laine was the other""Frankie"" and just as popular for many years. It will bring back memories for many people when life was happy and carefree. My favorite is ""Wild Goose"" I was very happy to find this item on Amazon. Keep those oldies coming!"
3,Frankie Lane,"The cd is a double, the first album are swing songs of the 50's that I either didn't know or really care for. The second album ""Hell Bent for Leather"" is terrific. rousing western songs done in a rich style that makes you feel you are in the old west."
1,Really awful,"I wanted to like this film but it is long and boring. Ben Kingsley did a nice job with what he had but this movie is ill-conceived. There are lots of shots of machinery, train engines and molten steel set to Shostakovich's music. The integration of black and white with color did not help. This is only for the really hard-core Shostakovich fan and then don't expect many insights. I want my 2 1/2 hours back !"
3,"Great Film of a Great Composer, but....","... the video transfer appears to be absolutely awful. It looks like it might have been transferred from video table instead of from the original negative or even a good print. In order to squeeze a movie that is more than two hours long onto a single-sided DVD they must have used lower quality compression. Rather expensive for a DVD of such low quality.If you haven't seen the movie before and you love Shostakovich, buy a used copy, save your money, and enjoy. You won't be disappointed."
5,An amazing portrait of Shostakovich and a horrifying era,"This film is much more than another ""composer biography"". It is a riveting portrait of an artist working in a straight-jacket, a dictator who insisted on being called ""our teacher"" and the ""great gardener"" - because he was cultivating a new state and people. In short, in honor of Shostakovich's 100th birthday and his extrarodinary contribution to music; this film deserves to be seen."
1,Great film but a terrible dvd,The image quality of this dvd is so bad that even the VHS copy I taped years ago from Dutch television is much better. Absolutely no image restoration! But a great film though. I hope there will be a better version in the future to do this film justice.Rob Kwak.
1,Warning: Shameful Transfer!!,"Having watched a 1-hour version of this film several years ago on TV, I was elated at finding out the complete version was on DVD. So much for the good news. When I started watching it I thought something was wrong with my DVD player; unfortunately (or fortunately!) there was nothing wrong with the player... the quality of the transfer is just horrible, equal to a very worn out VHS tape. For the price this is going for, it's highway robbery. You've been warned. By the way, the film is excellent... the sequence at Babi Yar is ver poignant. Hopefully someday the film will get a decent remastering. 5 stars for the film; 0 stars for the DVD. Too bad."
1,Don't Buy This,"This film neither offers an appreciation of Shostakovich's music, nor does it present a plausible historical context of his life. All characters, including Shostakovich, appear as caricatures, particularly that of Stalin. Dialogues are carelessly adopted from the book and the music is butchered by distaste and historical confusion. Just buy two good recordings of Shostakovich music and enjoy. Forget this horrendous DVD."
4,concise material for research student on fluid dynamics,"the content suit student who would like to study fluid dynamics in a more specific content. those content are important and critical in fluid. this new book has the quite new fleid like MEMS, it also has interesting historical note, and mixing. this book is useful."
4,Really helped my French pronunciation!,"At first I was sceptical, but my doubts fell away after I started working through this book and tape combination. This is a very systematic and logical guide to French pronunciation that approaches it from the angle of French spelling rather than of the sounds (e.g., how to pronounce 'euil' in various words.) My spouse (whose French is excellent) commented right away that my accent was much improved! The only minor criticism I have (and the only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars) is that the book doesn't use the International Phonetic Alphabet symbols; I would recommend to anyone using it that he or she find a way to match up the sounds with the corresponding IPA symbols. This will help when trying to figure out the pronunciation of new words shown in a dictionary. Other than that, highly recommended!"
4,Good for indoor use,"Nice door for indoor use. The small size is larger than several other brands we looked at, with the U-shaped door providing more space than half-circle styles. I appreciate the 4-way lock. It doesn't seal well, so I wouldn't use it as a single flap on an outside door. We use two of them, one on a small cat house in the yard constructed over a basement window and the second through that basement window, forming a kind of airlock between the outdoors and our basement."
1,Does not block airflow,"This cat flap is basically well constructed and seems durable. However, there was no effort in providing an air barrier between the inside / outside of the house. There is a substancial air gap around the flap which will let a LOT of air flow around the opening. Perhaps I was expecting too much, but my hope was to have an actual air barrier."
4,Good interior door,"Purchased two of these: - my 70 lbs husky tried chewing through and was not able to chew the plastic frame. Overall, well made, durable up to a 70lbs dog's determination. We did have to replace, she cracked the frame a little bit, but still remained a solid piece.Pros:Good interior door - would not recommend for a outside door unless you add your own insulation.Durable plasticEasily adjustableCleans easy (cat fur from inside)Clear plastic door cleans nicelymy cat slams her head running full charge through the door and the swinging of the flap has not broken.Cons:Red lock - rather small and you have to memorize which position each setting is on unless you want to get on the floor to read the plastic label. Added nail polish to make letter stand out.Odd sizing - had to replace with exact product - no other brand uses this measurementScrews take some arm muscle to install, but the unit holds together securely. No gap between hallow door."
3,Spanish pop from the 70's,"A nice collection of a fashionable group from the early seventies that enjoyed success, specially with some so called 'best song of the summer' themes. Well played and listenable."
2,Preschool,"I have worked out with many videos, brands and type of training for a number of years. I became an AKA last October and received my first prosthetic in March of this year. I found this video undemanding and way too preschool for me."
1,DON'T BUY SAITEK !!!!,"DEAR AMAZON BUYERS,DON'T BUY THIS SAITEK HAND HELD BRIDGE --I HAVE ONE& IT'S BLACK AND WHITE WHICH MAKES IT VERY VERY HARD TOREAD PLUS --(...)"
3,register your s/n with Sandisk before it rubs off the outside,"The serial number on this flash drive is printed on the outside of it and rubs off easily, which can be a real problem if you have a warranty issue. Mine fried a year into the two year warranty and if it had not been for a slick USB diagnostics utility from Microsoft (UVCView) I would not have been able to retrieve the serial number to get warranty service. In the end Sandisk was great though and they replaced the dead stick with a new one. Recommended - just remember to write down your s/n!"
5,fabulous little flash drive!,"The SanDisk 1GB Cruzer Micro USB Flash Drive is fabulous... the caps( what I was most concerned about) don't go anywhere and are constructed with little locks inside the cap that slip into the two holes on the top of the drive to keep the cap in place.. even better, the flash drive has a very low profile and is perfect for putting in my desktop at work. I can slip my keyboard right over it with no problems and still have lots of workspace on my little table.. I highly recommend this flash drive.."
3,Won't fit HP USB port,"I just purchased this product and was very excited to upgrade from my 128mb drive. Because I work on several different computers, being able to easily move files from one to another is important. However, this drive will not fit into my HP/Compaq desktop computer which is my primary computer. It fits well on my Dell laptop and my Dell desktop, however.Great product but with out the portability, not much use."
5,Simply the best USB memory,"Up to now, i have used about 5 USB memories, but undoubtely this one is the best in terms of size and security."
4,i need a new one.,"this is a good product. got mine more than a year ago. it lights up blue with no skins rather than green with skins. older model. but it works just the same. the only problem i have ever had with it is the caps got loose and would fall off all the time. and since i took it everywhere, that was a problem. so i just said whatever and went capless (they are long gone by now anyways). its kinda getting thrashed now from being in my pocket all the time, and with no cap that might make matters worse. i think its time for an upgrade. especially since im using it everyday back and forth from art school with important documents and stuff. basically my whole future depends on this thing."
5,Great for School,"I am going to school for my graduate degree in nursing. I download all of my presentations, and school folders on this flash drive without problems. It is very easy to use. I don't know how I lived without it."
2,Poor SanDisk customer service,"Liked the size, and it seemed to work for the two months I've had it. But the plastic keychain hook broke, so I can't attach it to my keys -- the whole point of having it in the first place. The place I purchased it from was willing to replace it, but they no longer carried it. They said to just contact SanDisk, as it was under warranty. Called them, and they said any physical damage voids the warranty. So, I'll avoid SanDisk products from now on. Too bad, as it seemed like a decent enough drive. I'm just tired of companies that won't stand behind their products. Next time I'll buy from Amazon, which has the best customer service I've seen."
4,Compact and fast,"This is a great product, when you need huge quantity of information in a very little device.An disagree with this product is the slow what it is, when you try to write huge of little files, aprox. 15min. for a 100Mb. on 1200 xml files... take cake about it... I prefer compress and then copy the zip file."
1,U3 feature not revealed,The U3 launchpad does not work with some specialized data loaders (Aircraft MFDs). I was trying to buy non U3 drives and there is nothing in the Naming of this product that reveals it is a U3. When I got the product I found in the small print that it was U3. The process provided by Sandisk to remove U3 just doesn't seem to really work.
5,Launders Well,This flash drive is GREAT. It worked well out of the box and works well after being washed and dried. Make sure you check your pockets before you do the laundry!
4,Skins not an improvement,"Basically the same as the smaller-capacity Cruzer Micro devices, but the unit is now separated into two pieces; a rubber sleeve (you get three: clear, blue and red) and the aluminum-covered core. The hard plastic cap is now the same rubber material as the sleeve, with small nubs that fit into the holes on the usb plug so it locks on. Unfortunately, the lanyard ring is now so small that the cap can't snap onto it when the unit is plugged in, so expect to lose the cap almost immediately.Skins aside, it's an excellent unit, and almost the smallest usb flash drive you can buy."
1,I give it one too many stars!,"This drive is very fast and convenient. I liked mine and bought a second. Unfortunately, they were like mice, they moved quickly and died quickly, one at 2 months, the other at 3 months. With respect to tech support for the drive, it was easier to find on-line complaints than on-line service. But the price is cheap. If all you need to do is transfer documents between computers, I imagine you could buy a dozen and at least 6 would still function after a year. The company needs to learn some basic lessons about quality control. But did I say they were cheap?"
4,Excellent gizmo,"I bought several of these for friends and family, and I kept my self a 1 GB one. I'm happy with it, fast transfer rates with USB 2.0 ports, very small and portable, and, best of all, very cheap.I did not give it 5 stars because the protective case does not fit tighlty on them, so if you are not careful, it may fall off and you can lose it (both cap and protective case). My wife already lost 1 cap after only two weeks of use.But on the other hand, I can agree with other reviewers in that the little thing is washer-machine safe, after my brother-in-law had his pass the laundry test, twice."
1,don't buy this,"it works well for a week or two. then just stops.win xp sp2 beeps when drive inserted, but no drive letter shows up.search the web - there are thousands of people in the same boat.and not a driver in sight on the sandisk download pageit sucks!"
4,Great buy,"Its worth all the 36$ i payed for, Its small, its fast and has been so far great using it. It comes with security Lock software which is great for my kind of use too. All in all ..go ahead and buy."
4,Not bad.....,"This thing is great. Space isn't an issue and with a rebate, it makes it all the more worth while.Though, its dimensions may be something of a double edged sword. I have a first gen Lexar JumpDrive and I thought that was fine. However, this thing is TINY. Its about the size of two dimes and the thickness of 3-4. So, its portable, yes, but very VERY easy to misplace!Still, I love mine and have found it very useful."
5,Great product so far,"I've only had it for a couple weeks, but so far it's done its job with no problems. One gig of space, tiny size... as long as it keeps working, I give it a huge thumbs up!"
5,AWESOME!,This usb flash drive is so cute and convinient! I love how they give you three cases so you can change the colors.
5,Excellent Value!,"I bought this for my husband and he loves it! It's nice and small so you can easily carry it around. Also, we've tried it on our dell desktop and his HP laptop and it works perfectly on both of them. With the recent rebate, the 1 GB storage and the excellent price, you can't go wrong!"
5,Use it on my bluray player,"I use this on my bluray player to access bdlive. Works perfectly. Ive used other sandisk usb drives in the past, and they always work very well and last a long time.The size of this one is a plus since its sticking out the back of my bluray player."
2,Great product but short life,"I had this product for more than a year and had no problems until last month. I am unable to read the drive because of some I/O device error. On trying to get it resolved, I spent a lot of time since then troubleshooting, contacting product support, searching product issue forums etc - but havent been able to get the problem resolved. Seems I will have to scrap this piece and purchase a new one."
5,good flash drive,Very good flash drive; note the picture on the webpage doesn't exactly match the hardware.
5,"Looking 4 a 1GB Flash Drive, Go for this...","Actually if u r looking to buy a 1GB Flash drive, then this product ""Sandisk Cruzer"" is a very good choice... Great product for good price and u get two more color changeable face plates for this Cruzer!!! Liked this flash drive a lot, because its very small in size and functioning properly, stores 1 GB of data!!! Love this product..."
5,great item,"I am completely satisfied with item. I was pleased to see that it came with 3 colored skins which you could use for it, which is pretty neat. If the rebate comes in, I will be completely satisfied."
5,Awesome !! Best Product,"Sandisk is the best memory manufacturer. This is just a great product. Just go for it. I know that there might be other flash drives available from other manufacturer in a couple of dollars less. But I prefer peace of mind and reliability. Hence spend 1-2 $ extra and only get a sandisk.I didnot find any problems with the cap. Its just fine. I didnot loose it either. Moreover Micro is so small, that I just love it.It has also got that good software with it. Its good and reliable.So far no problems with the product and I am very happy with the purchase.Go for it !!"
1,Not durable,"Although this jump drive is very compact and slick-looking, I had a big problem with it. After about a week on my keychain, the plastic piece broke off, fell off my keychain, and is somewhere on the ground. So, I would recommend against this product if you plan to keep it on your keychain. Maybe check out Lexar."
3,"OK, not great!","Was OK the first week, then gave a problem. Does not copy files properly, reports some kind of 'errors'. Does not tell you how to fix the problem. SOme files are copied OK, some not"
4,Gets the job done,This is an awesome product. We recently had guests over and it was really nice to not have to excuse myself to another room. I felt confident sitting that I wouldn't be indecently exposed. This nursing cover hooks around the neck so your hands are free for baby. The wire collar works great allowing for out-door bonding with your little one and there is a wipe cloth sewn at the bottom corners for spillage. I love the design and the material isn't heavy so great for summer use. I love this product.
5,Nursing Cover,It's awesome and works great. I can see my son as he eats and I don't have to worry about it falling down in front of other people. It goes right around my neck and its easy to use. It's not too hot either for my son.
4,wonderful idea,I love the nursing cover. Not only is it fashionable it does what it is supposed to do. I can nurse at church or a restaurant or soccer practice. I would recommend it to anyone who breastfeeds.
5,well covered mom,i LOVE this thing!! and all the pattern and color choices are fabulous! i was reluctant to buy this when i felt like a light blanket would do just fine and then my 5 month old started removing his nursing blanket in public! i so wish i had purchased this bebe au lait before he was born! i use it all the time.
4,Great Nursing Cover,"This is a great nursing cover! The fabric is light enough that it does not cling to the baby, but it is still opaque. I also like the plastic at the top of the cover, as it enables me to look at my baby. The strap that goes over my head ensures that the cover stays in place. This is a really great buy, for moms who nurse in public and need the privacy.The only reason I did not give this product 5 stars is because of the price. It is IMO overpriced. Anyone with sewing skills should be able to make one of these easily, I unfortunately do not have any of these skills"
4,"Works great, but gets a little hot","I love the print and love that it's cotton. The terry cloth corners are also great for wiping up and cleaning up. It also does a great job keeping us covered. The only down side to this cover is that it gets a little hot for both me and the babe, which is a bummer."
5,Great product,I love this nursing cover. I tried another one without the wire support around the neck area and found it very cumbersome and frustrating. This one provides ample coverage and is easy to put on. I often use it at home when I have guests over so I can nurse and still be a part of the conversation. I also love the stylish prints that are available.
3,Just okay,"This nursing cover is definitely made with enough material to provide you with the privacy you need to breastfeed comfortably in front of others, but I am not able to maintain eye contact with my little one like the product description promises.I've found that if I loosen the strap so the neckline is at, or just above the level ofmy armpits (like in the picture), the center falls down so my cleavage is revealed and if I tighten the strap so the neckline is closer to my own then the material folds under and covers my sons face.I wouldn't recommend this product to a friend, but I also wouldn't necessarily discourage them from buying it either just because the strap itself makes it easier to us than a blanket."
5,A Must Have for BF moms,"I got mine (Yoko) in 2008 and used it to nurse my two kids. It is soooo beautiful and looks great for nursing a girl and a boy. It was still pretty new when I used it for my second child last year (2011). It makes nursing in public (clinic, playdates, airplane, theatre, car etc.) so much easier and more comfortable. I am passing it on to a friend and I know that she would get a good use of it. Great product that worth the investment!"
3,Good but expensive product,"This is a good product that does what it is supposed to do. However, it is a bit on expensive side. Also a band or something to hold this cover across the back would have been nice. Our little son can easily grab it and move it around so mommy has to be always on edge.For the material and labor that went into this it is definitely not worth the price. Thats why I am giving it 3 stars."
3,has to be washed by separate q:O,It.s just what i need but need some improvements....need to be wider to cover mommy's sides and the fabric needs to be different because i had to wash it by separate because the colors stains other clothes :-( ....
3,Okay,"One good thing is that it has a cute print, the pictures are very accurate. I was excited to get this product but now I wish I hadn't. My daughter didn't like being so enclosed she actually prefers a blanket over the nursing cover even though the cover gives her a little more space and isn't right on her face like a blanket. On one hand it is nice to have the boning so you can see your baby while feeding but the problem is that it makes it easy for baby to pull down and expose what you are working so hard to hide plus it makes it hard to fold compactly. I purchased when my baby was 3 months old. I think it would work well for a baby up to a couple months old but not beyond for most babies. Too bad it didn't work for me and my baby."
5,Cute & Functional,"I purchased this after seeing my friends easily nurse their babies in public, while I struggled to keep my blanket covered over my baby. I get complements on it all of the time. The pattern is really pretty & stylish, and it easily slips over my head, providing great coverage while my baby nurses. It rolls up really nicely to fit in my diaper bag. I don't leave the house without it!! Great purchase."
2,can't see my baby,"I put this product on baby registry because the ability to see my baby while nursing seemed very attractive. This was one of the most expensive privacy blankets on the market. I am disappointed that it is not very easy to use, especially with a baby who does not latch on too well and is fussy. If your baby goes to the breast easily, this may not be a problem, but so far, I have been unable to use it."
4,Pretty and effective,"This nursing cover did the job quite nicely. It folds down small, so easy to keep in a diaper bag. Easy to pull over your head while holding a baby, and keeps things covered up well. I like the chateau endive color, was cool and springy. I also liked how the cotners were terry cloth. I think they keep the cover weighted slightly so it doesnt blow in the breeze. And its also convenient for wiping spit up if you dont have a burp cloth handy."
5,Very Useful and practical,"It is a clothe very useful and practil for nursing mothers, because it protects hers clothes from normal use. Is very confortable and ligth."
5,"Discreet, comfortable, and simple","I bought mine at the hospital gift shop shortly after giving birth to my daughter 3.5 years ago. I saw it and was like hey that's handy. I've never regretted that choice. I nursed her for 1 year using it, and its handy to have something to cover up that wont migrate. I love the stiffer area around the neck so that I could peak down on her. The fabric is nice weight, and even though I had her in AZ in the summer we were never overheated like we would have been with a blanket. I am due any day now with my second and this was the first thing I slipped into my diaper bag. I love the color choices! Makes me almost want to purchase a second one. A friend makes them, and hers are no where near as nice, though I won't tell her that."
5,Love this product,"As a first time mom, I was really unsure about these types of cover-ups. I thought I could just use a blank and not worry about it. After 2 weeks of trying to nurse in public with a blanket and a newborn who still had latching difficulties, I bought this. It is so fantastic!! The wire around the neck that holds the cover up out is perfect for seeing your baby. You can tell if she's sleeping, latching correctly, and help her get realigned if she is not latched properly. This product also lends for more versatility and independance. I feel as though I can nurse my little girl in public anywhere and be comfortable. The design is a bit loud, but I have heard from others that at a glance it looks like a shirt. I'm not sure it's possible to really blend in with any nursing cover up.The only complaint I have is that it can get really hot under the cover up."
4,much better than a blanket!,Great product! The neck strap keeps the fabric covering you while keeping your hands free. The inside pocket is great for storing your breast pad. The only thing I would change is I would like there to be a little more fabric on the sides. I'm petite and I sometimes have a hard time keeping both sides of me covered while I'm nursing. I would definetly recommend this product to any nursing mom!
5,Nursing cover,I bought this for my daughter. She is nursing her third child and picked it out specifically. She wanted something so she could nurse him at our family reunion. She's used a baby blanket in the past and found it annoying because it would slip down and she couldn't easily see the baby. She's very happy with the nursing cover as she is covered and she can easily peek at the baby. Also this is an unusual item not available in any of our local stores.
5,Very Pretty,"Very pretty and easy to use. I also love that the ""collar"" area has a structured portion so that the cover doesnt lie flat on your chest. it allows for better ventilation for the baby as well as gives you a ""view"" of baby while nursing. I guess my only wish is that is came with a little carrying bag or something. That is just me really searching for a way to make this more perfect though. :)"
5,Best nursing cover out there,"This is my third baby and my 12th nursing cover, every one I've tried is too small to cover a wiggly baby, too difficult to get on quickly and too hard to see what you're doing without flashing people. This one solves all those problems! It's big enough to cover even the thrashing baby and the arched neck allows you to see what you're doing without exposing yourself. I would recommend this cover to anyone - by far the best I've found!"
1,the cloth is thin and not good quality. not worth the money,the cloth is thin and not good quality. not worth the money. i was hoping something much better with this price
3,Not as useful as I thought it would be,I bought this nursing cover because I wanted something beautiful and stylish to wear out - every other nursing cover I found I wasn't too impressed with. When I was finally able to use this cover - it's too short length wise and def. not for bigger breasted women or if you've given birth to a larger newborn (my little man was 9lbs). I'm pretty disappointed and will end up having to get a different cover :(
5,It works,Great stylish product. Has come in very handy even at home with guests staying over I don't have to run up to my bedroom to nurse my baby. Package came even earlier than estimated. Very happy overall!
4,does what it's supposed to do,i bought this for my wife during the breastfeeding days. it performed well and covered her appropriately in style during feeds. it was a permanent item in the diaper dude bag!
5,Wonderful!,"I REALY REALLY like this nursing cover and have found it sooo useful! I'm generally not a fan of nursing in public and will try to take along a bottle with previously expressed milk when possible. But for those times when I'm not able to (or when I'm too lazy to pump ahead of time), this nursing cover does its job very well. If you can sit in a chair with a back, this cover will be able to cover your front and sides adequately. I like the wired neck opening so that I don't have to hold the cloth up to see my baby. On top of that, Bebe au Lait has lots of cute patterns to choose from. This is a gift that I definitely want to get for my other nursing friends."
1,Don't bother,"This is the first product review that I have ever submitted, as I felt the need to describe this product and it's lack of adequacy. First of all, this product is highly over-priced. At over $30, you are essentially paying triple the cost of a $5 piece of material, insufficient boning support (needed to be able to see your baby without holding the neck area up yourself), and a small buckle. If you plan to use this product with a newborn (which means that you need both hands to latch the baby), you'd better either develop x-ray vision to see through the material or learn to latch without any visual assistance, because the neck support WILL NOT stay up on it's own. Better to safe yourself the money and hassle of returing, and either use a blanket/towel or make your own."
3,Picture is misleading,"I love this wrap. It's very functional and much easier to use than a blanket. However, I was disappointed when I received it in the mail, because the colors were not what I was expecting. The picture makes it look very pink with pastels and chocolate. But it's actually very red, with other very vibrant colors. I would have ordered a different pattern if I'd seen it in person. Buyers beware!"
4,does what it's supposed to...,"It's just difficult to manouever with it on. I like the idea of it, but in all honesty it is hard to drape it just right, hold the baby, undo the bra and fiddle with the shirt, get the baby under the fabric and latched on... By then he was screaming. I'd have been less obvious if I'd just latched him quickly before he drew more attention to us. Practice nursing discreetly in front of a mirror, and you'll be able to do it in public without anyone noticing. But in the mean time, it was nice to have the security of knowing that I could be covered up."
3,shrunk half its size!,"i like to wash all my things before wearing it -- especially when it comes to baby related items. the tag states that this nursing cover is ""100% cotton, slight shrinkage may occur"". but to my surprise, it didn't shrink slightly -- it shrunk half its size! I washed as directed so i don't know what had happened. i'm very disappointed.update:amazon sent me a replacement and the new nursing cover shrunk about an inch after washing and drying as directed. so much better than the first one! thanks amazon for the replacement!"
3,very bulky,"the cover is too bulky, so to say. too much material, and it does not cover the sides, just the front. it is also very hot to use in summer, my baby would get really sweaty under this cover. the ring that goes around your neck is not ""hard"" enough and does not stay open for you to see the baby as you nurse. it keeps falling in"
4,love but wish it had a back for more privacy,"I love this, so pretty,so soft, so lightweight and airy. I can even just hold my baby in it on a sunny hot day to keepthe sun off of her and she isnt sweating because of the cool material and i can look down at her. I love it for nursing too but I think it would just be better if it was more like a shaw, with the rigid neckline since sometimes i feel worried my side will be exposed."
4,Works well,"I ordered the ""parkside"" print and absolutely love it. It isn't too bright or too loud. Product folds well and takes up minimal space in baby's bag. I have a very active baby, and he doesn't like it at all when I put anything over his head while he's nursing (be it a nursing cover, a blanket, a towel, or anything else I've tried to cover him with while nursing in public). But unlike all the other things I've tried, this nursing cover doesn't come off when he tries to yank it down (which he does often). I haven't used the pockets yet, except to wipe up my baby's face when there's milk dripping off of it, but they're big enough to fit my tube on lanolin if I ever needed to. Would have given this 5 stars, but it can get pretty hot underneath, so I understand why my baby doesn't like it much. To be fair, the only things I've found that were cool and breathable enough were his aden +anais muslin swaddling blankets, but like I said, he pulls that right off."
4,Great Cover,"It is a great cover, but my little one always falls asleep so much sooner under the cover. I only use it when there isn't a room I can go into. I love it, but my little one doesn't eat as much when I use it because it is heavy and dark."
3,a $25 Nursing Apron...,"This might be useful for some, but what it basically is is a very wide cotton apron. I would even suggest loop at the back like a real apron that would help hold it in place. Having said that, I don't see why it has to be so expensive. I bought this because I thought it would be really useful when guests drop in at feeding times, and it is, but after one look at it I knew that even a novice like me can buy some material from Jo-Ann and stitch something like this"
4,"Great product, but consider lighter color choices","This is a great product. I'm a first time mom, so nursing is all new for me. This cover really helps me with nursing in public because it provides privacy while the wire support allows me to monitor my baby's progress. I also like the little pocket on the cover where I keep a burp cloth handy for quick access. The cover gives the flexibility for me and my husband to still go out to restaurants and make long road trips with friends and family. A few moms walking their kids in the park told me it would have been helpful if they knew about it when they were nursing.I received two from my shower; a white one and a black one. My baby prefers the white one much more than the black one, because the black one traps a lot of heat. Especially if you are nursing outside in the sun. In addition, you can see every piece of lint/dust statically clinging to the black cover. Due to those negative factors, I don't use the black one much anymore."
5,Excellent product,This is a great nursing cover! I've had others before and this has more fabric for greater coverage and I love the design at the top - it's really helpful to be able to see to in order to get the baby latched on! A really great product - I wish I'd had one with my first two babies.
4,nursing cover,"I got this cover for my neice as a gift. My daughter had one (different brand), and saw that this one was cheaper and had more choices of fabric colors so I got it. The fabric is much nicer than the one my daughter had. The only complaint I would say is that the 'boning' that holds the fabric up so you can see the baby kinda bends so she has to adjust the opening from time to time. But its great for the value."
4,Purchased for gift,Purchased for a shower gift. I compared with same product in retail shops and this was less expensive. I would definitely purchase other baby/mother items from Amazon.
4,Works great for nursing on the go,"As a first time mom just getting used to nursing in public, this cover has been great. It's super easy to use and folds nicely into my son's diaper bag. I like that I am able to maintain eye contact with my son while maintaining my privacy. It does get a little warm under there, however, though the fabric doesn't appear terribly thick at first glance."
3,baby gets too hot,"baby gets too hot and doesn't get enough air I think he didn't like it at the beginning hope he will get used to it as he kept pushing the cover away from him, the design it is too extravagant or brings everyone's attention that I'm breastfeeding"
2,Not a Cover Lover...,"Skip it. I cannot speak for all babies, but I would test out a homemade prototype before buying a nursing cover...my daughter was always shucking it off due to our excessive body heat. Collar sometimes worked, and sometimes didn't. Somehow it brought more attention to a breastfeeding session as opposed to just 1977ing it. Keep the deal natural and sweet by not purchasing this cover."
3,not all that!,ya it covers but i dont think its worth that much money. its basically a piece of material cloth with a buckle to go around your neck. the baby still get warm underneath it i guess it depends on the colors you choose. but with that if you go too light and it will definitely become see through
1,Save your money,"Someone got me one of these as shower gift. Totatlly worthless. It is much easier, more comfortable and more discrete just to wear a loose shirt."
1,SO UNHAPPY,This is NOT the way the cover looks it is SOOOOO NOT Pink and Brown. The picture on this is beyond wrong. The product is great but the color was terrible in person.
3,Looks Great but gets hot,"This product works.. covers you up and you are able to nurse inconspicuously in public. It looks great and I like that you can also see your baby through the top due to the bit of wire. The big draw back for me is that both mother and baby get hot and sweaty. The fabric is not breathable and by the time you configure everything (baby, top, nursing position in public) it is so uncomfortable. A light muslin blanket is actually more comfortable and serves more then one purpose. A bit pricy for something not entirely necessary or comfortable.I would rather spend the about the same amount and get more of these :aden + anais 4-pk. Mod About Turtle Swaddles"
3,Too warm,"This is a helpful product, no doubt. My biggest complaint is that it is surprisingly warm and that my infant tended to fall asleep rather than nurse, because of this. He was born in October, so I was mainly using it in winter months."
5,A historical perspective on Culture.,Fascinating look at the historical meaning of Culture. I highly recommend it to any thinking person who wants to understand today's world and how we got where we are.
4,Pretty good enclosure for the price,"I just installed my new hard drive into this enclosure and it was very smooth and easy. The tray is very useful when installing the drive. It took about 5 minutes to complete the installation. It is very compact and light. Heat dissepation is also pretty good. Computer recognized it immediately, however your hard drive needs to be formatted before you install it or you need PartitianMAgic software to format inside this enclosure. The reason I gave 4 starts is the after installation the hard drive is kind of jiggling inside the enclosure. I put a small piece of paper towel and it got rid of the problem. This enlosure compatible with both 100/133 hard drives and there is no limit to harddrive size you can put in it. Overall I recomend it."
4,nice aluminum USB drive enclosure,"I have 2 of these (earlier model) and they work great with my 160GB EIDE drives. I just ordered 2 more from Amazon.NOTE: it does NOT fit the thicker (yes, thicker) 3.5"" hard drives. My 3.5"" 160GB EIDE drives fit fine. However, the thicker (older model) 3.5"" 250GB EIDE drive was too snug and rubbed against the top of the enclosure (works but too tight to slide in and out of the enclosure)."
3,question about shipping,i would like to order 30 of these lamp kits. is they any way to adjust the shipping cost - it is quite high? please get back to me. thank you
1,You've got to be kidding?,"Shameless capitalism at it's lowest! It doesn't deserve 1 star, but negative stars aren't allowed. People should read the Bible if they are interested in how to conduct their lives righteously. The Scriptures are not a recipe for creating earthly wealth. Ms. Jones is way off base in attempting to convince people that financial success is scripture based. Ms. Jones, my Bible talks about God's followers being pilgrims and strangers on earth. Christ had no where to lay his head and he knew nothing of being incorporated! If you want a good business book, look elsewhere. If you want religious/life direction, just read your Bible."
5,An excellent complement of the movie,"This book is very interesting, because it gives a different approach of the Civil War, far from the history books we usually read.I don't agree with the review below, this book has some errors, but is still valuable. A very good complement for the Civil War studies."
5,Faith in Gods and Generals,"Having published a review of the film ""Gods and Generals,"" I found this book an interesting companion to it. This beautifully illustrated anthology provides insights into individuals caught up on both sides of the Civil War and how their faith guided them. The excellent Forword by Ron Maxwell is a must read. It makes a great gift book."
1,Hardly worth the time to write a bad review,"If you know anything about the Civil War . . .or want to learn anything about the Civil War. . .leave this miserable book on the shelf--or better yet throw it on the garbage pile. It is rife with errors that even individuals with a casual interest in the Civil War can find. (My personal favorite is the authors/publishers selecting a photograph of Winfield Scott and labeling it Winfield Scott Hancock. If you don't know the difference, you shouldn't be writing, editing OR publishing books on the Civil War.)This is amateur hour at its best. Go buy books authored by professional Civil War historians. This is excrement."
1,this seller sold me a piece of crap,ok I purchased this 2GB ram from Warehouse Deals inc for $29.57and when I get it home to install it on my mac . Guess what the freakin ram is blank there is no memory on it at allI bought another one for 1gb and it worked fine but when I put it with the 2 GB the PIECE OF CRAP ! is completely blanki want my money back and would recommend not to purchase anything from this selleri dont know about you but i dont have time to order stuff off amazon for it to be not what i expected and have to pay to ship it back for some defectivecrap they sent to me. I am so pissed right now !
5,excelent choice,"Es una excelente memoria le dio toda la velocidad que necesitaba para mi notebook, arranca super rapido, mejoro el video y funciona perfectamente, la instalacion fue super sencilla, fue tremenda compra"
5,"Good price, great product","- Good price, great brand.- Kingston delivers not only the memory but the confidence that you plug it in and rest assure that it will working properly.- Always research to ensure you get the right type of memory for your computer prior to any purchase."
2,Defective.,Ram never worked. I didn't pay much for it and to return it was gonna be a waste of time due the cost send it back anyway.
5,Kingston PC2-5300 1GB memory - it just works,Purchased an additional 1GB memory stick to bring my daughters Dell Inspiron 6000 up to a full 2GB Ram (the most that can be added to this laptop). Had upgraded to Windows 7 32-bit Home Premium some time ago from Windows XP Media Center (SP3). Had to reboot a couple of times to get the system to recognize the additional ram (BIOS automatically recognizes a memory change). But finally got everything up and running. PC seems to run better on Win 7 than XP. I have always used Kingston for memory upgrades and have never been disappointed.
4,It's Kingston ram,Knocked one star off since it's Kingston ram and the reputation isn't great. So far it's worked as advertised though and has breathed new life into my MSI Wind U100 for another year until I can afford a new PC.
3,wrong ram,My computer was listed as being compatible w/ this RAM but when I received it I found it was not.
1,Does not work on my 2007 Toshiba Satallite Laptop,"Amazon Web said this 1GB memory strip will work on my 2007 Satellite P205 laptop but it did work becuase the notch is on the right side (it should be on the left side), so I have it to return to amazon."
3,Just OK,"I bought this to upgrade my ASUS Eee PC 900 from 1gig to 2gig. It was real easy to install and the computer recognized the new chip immediately. I was hoping that it would help speed up this realy slow PC in opening Apps, but it's only a minor improvement. The PC starts Windows more quickly for sure. But most Apps are still slow to load, especially Windows Explorer. I suspect that the Solid State Hard Drive is to blame, as I've read that regular Hard Drives work faster with this upgrade.I'd do it again, but just don't get your hopes up too high.If you're not a techie and are afraid of doing this upgrade yourself, I'd get it anyway as it's practically a no-brainer. Kingston makes good stuff and the included instructions are easy to follow.I hope this helps!"
5,I really like it.,"I'm not really computer-tech-savy, so I'll just say, I've owned two of these cards for two netbooks and I have yet to be let down."
5,Excellant Value,This 2GB memory card is an excellent value for the price. It was very easy to install. Please remember that if you have 2 smaller memory cards you must insert this 2 GB card as the main memory and at least in mine I couldn't use the other 512MB card in the other slot. My computer is lightning fast now!
5,Does it's job,"I had 3GB manufactured in my Laptop already, however, I wanted to expand the system memory to speed things up a bit. It did. The only problem is to get full functionality of your 4GB, you have to install a 64 bit operating system, which luckily I had both a 32 bit and a 64 bit version of the product on hand, otherwise, you might end up having to go out and buy a 64 bit operating system. Good luck!!"
4,Worked as said.,upgraded to dell e 1505. though dell says that i can only upgrade to 2 gb in total but i added this one and it works perfectly.
5,Fantastic RAM & for a great price!,"This is great PC Ram!After installing (which was a breeze) into my HP Pavilion dv4000, it works great and has helped greatly with system performance & speed!I spent $30 for my first 1 GB Adata RAM upgrade, so this is a great deal!"
1,terrible,HORRIVEL O AMAZON ME MANDOU TUDO ERRADO. PEDI MEMORIA DE NOOTEBBOK E MANDARAM DE DESKTOP.TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Wrong Item Inside,"I received this item promptly from Amazon.com. When item was received I noticed that the package was just resealed. True enough, the content was just a 1gb ram although the sticker attached to it indicated it was a 2gb. I am returning this for a refund and maybe reorder another one in the future."
3,Review,"I installed the memory 2GB*2 on my T61 Laptop, (800MHz bus frequency) it works fine, but it doesn't work as well as I expected, in running a benchmark in MATLAB 2008b, it's even slower than my original Hyundai memory 1GB*2. Maybe the CAS latency is too high, or it's incompatible with the 800MHz mainboard.To get access to 4GHz in 32bit machine, make sure you turn on PAE (physical address extension), or only 3GB will be used.Alternatively, if you're using Debian/Ubuntu Linux, you can simply just use the server version (for ubuntu), or bigmem (for Debian)."
5,no problems what so ever,"Bought this almost an year ago for my HP pavillion(6226) laptop and its been working fine without any problems. Initially I had concerns as I was going to use this with a 512MB module, but thankfully there have been no issues."
5,Seamless integration into my netbook,"This enabled me to extend the RAM of my Asus Netbook from 1GB to 2GB. Excellent product, great price, easy installation. Highly recommended!"
3,incompatible with other brands,"The product works fine; however, I wanted to add it to my 1GB Samsung RAM that I already had installed and it was not compatible. The product description didn't say anything about compatibility with other brands. Perhaps it's their way to get you to buy more products from the same company, but it isn't fair to the customer about this issue."
5,Indiecredible!,"Diverse, clever, smart, charming and complex are just a few words that can barely describe this amazing album. Their music exhibits everything I love about indie rock. Listen to the samples and you'll get an idea of what I'm talking about. This is undoubtedly one of my favorite albums of the year!!!!!!!!"
4,Very Very good,"How to describe this album? Hmmm.... If you like the Arcade fire, Sunny DaY, Broken Social Scene, Radiohead etc etc, you need to buy this album.It amazes me that CC does not get more recognition, it is the perfect mix between melodic instrumentation and full out rock with intelligent lyrics to boot.I bought this album not really knowing what to expect but trust me, if you like any of the aforementioned bands you wont be disappointed."
3,hard copy good... electronic copy very bad.,"Still waiting for the hard copy... the electronic copy was not useable. The idea is a good one the execution is not up to par. Most other eBook sites offer an option for Adobe (.pdf) format so it can be viewed while off line, Amazon does not. You can only view or print a single page at a time with Amazon, also not very useful."
1,They don't stick,"I bought Ear Lifts and honestly, they are lousy. They don't stick well to the back of the ear and therefore, they don't work for the purpose intended. Lobe Wonders, on the other hand, are fantastic. They stick very firmly to the back of the ear so they really do hold up the earring instead of it falling into the torn earlobe. I will never use Ear Lifts again. Lobe Wonders are superior."
2,compared to lobe wonder...,I started with Lobe Wonder and when my retailer switched to Ear Lift I switched too....The Lobe Wonder is so superior to Ear Lifts. I will not be without Lobe Wonder as long as Amazon makes it available!
3,"Strong start, weak ending",The first half of this book was very entertaining. I loved the descriptions of the heists Mr. Mason pulled. The last half of the book was tedious. Mostly how he was in and out of jail.Still a good overall read.
2,The policeman's story,"Buying this book about a year ago I struggled with spending money on a person who made a living stealing. It was written well and I enjoyed the action. However, I Just finish reading Badge 149 the author is the policeman who arrested him. Wow, it was definately interesting to see the other side of his jewerly heist! All the action and this time money was well spent and some dedicated to fallen policemen !!!!!!!!"
2,Self centered chest thumping,"This book is all about HIM - me, me, me, blah blah blah...then story after tall tale that sound more like bravado than memoir. And he used the word ""apologize"" exactly twice."
3,Memories of a pathetic liar....,"I read this book mainly because I was involved in an important aspect of Bill Masons life, his arrest. I think the co-author did a good job of putting the events as he knew them down on paper. However much of the information was not true.. Therefore I see the book as being partially fiction.. The author Bill Mason has either a poor memory as to the facts of his arrest, or like in so many instances in his book he blames everyone else for his lack of integrity.. In a true, and honest account of his arrest, try reading Badge 149, Shots Fired, by retired Captain Gary Jones, these facts are undisputable and documented.. Overall the book of course is interesting and exciting until you factor in the lives of family and friends, and others that he harmed. I reviewed his book in a local library, not wanting to contribute to his continued lifestyle .Justice in his case is still pending, I bet his father if real proud of him..(hic)."
4,It's a no-brainer to imagine this book as a caper film,"Reading the mostly-wonderful ""Confessions...,"" I kept wishing I knew a way to bring it to the attention of William Goldman, the screenwriter of ""Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid"". Even before author Mason mentions that was one of his favorite films, he seems to be a character right out of Goldman?s wheelhouse: The rogue who is likable, almost despite himself.There's a seriously perfect movie to be made--here's hoping it's made soon and made well. I just wish the actors I kept picturing (Roy Scheider, George Carlin, Frank Sinatra) weren't either too old--or in Sinatra's case, too dead--to play Mason in his prime."
3,"Master Jewel Thief, Average Book","The first hundred pages of this book were enthralling, but after that is was more of an ego driven story about how much smarter he was than anyone else. The first hundred pages covered his develpoment as a thief, ""scores"", and how he combined this with his family and day job. I couldn't put it down. But soon after that the book turned to life behind bars, Mason duelling with the police, and a great deal on how he and his friends were much more itelligent than the DA's and police. Who he painted as angry, revenge fueled bullies. Certainly, this book is his side of the story and needs to be told, but the latter half of the book doesn't complete the energy he showed in the first half. I went from enticed to bored in about ten pages."
1,glad I didn't purchase the book,"I read a copy from the local library. It was a slog to finish. A long, tedious, brag-fest.He eventually claimed remorse for his crimes, but think about it: He wrote a book to sing his own praises and to profit from the crimes. Most people I know who are truly remorseful don't talk about the subject of their shame, but would rather move forward/beyond.He says he's gone almost completely legit. ""Almost"" legit??? It would seem like either you are or you aren't. His ""almost"" is that he's still hiding stolen goods and fencing them when his chosen lifestyle exceeds his income (pg 356).Please learn from my mistake and don't bother reading this book. I can't remember reading a book with a central character that I disliked as much."
3,No one could have stolen his ego....,"...because it's too big to move.Mason is a terrific thief, and his thoughts on thieving should be of interests to the criminal justice professional, the cautious jewel owner, and, well, aspiring jewel thieves across this great nation. From Mason I've learned the value of working without partners, developing my upper body strength, and never ever thinking that my urge to steal shouldn't be satisfied.To be fair, the tales of his crimes are entertaining. But as someone else noted, the stories of his crimes are interspersed with long anecdotes that basically revolve around how much everyone loves him and how good he is at everything he tries.Half the book is an interesting look at a master criminal at work. Reading the other half is a chore that is best forgotten."
4,Cat Burglar Remembers His Heists,"The detailed accounts of Mason's cat burglary exploits does indeed hold the reader's attention. It was more work to slog through the legal section where he feuded with the police and his lawyers. His jail time was interesting, as was his family life, but ultimately I began to resent his attitude.The book celebrates his daring robberies of the rich (Armand Hammer, Phyllis Diller) and the remorse at the end of the books seems merely token. He's sorry he got caught, sorry it hurt his family, but his motivation for stealing irked me and detracted from the account. It was mostly the thrill of defeating the security and plotting it out, more than needing the money, that drove him. Fairly candid, somewhat insightful, and certainly readable. Recommended for true crime fans."
5,Great Value,Reader's Digest piano books are simply the best. I have learned so much just be playing the pieces because they are arranged in such a manner that breathes new life into the chord structures they use.The books are not for the beginner nor for someone who has not had enough practice on the piano so that they are playing well. I enjoy them and others think they are hard...The song selections are fabulous! I might not know all of them but I have played them over and over until I know them right well. I also like to read the little bylines given about the song or the one who wrote the music as well as other interesting tid bits. You will spend hours playing in Reader's Digest Piano Books. I have every one they have published! I never lend my R.D. books out! They mean that much to me.
1,Songs of the South/Songs of the Sea,"I ordered this cd for nostalgic reasons because my dad had both LPs when I was a child. However, the sound quality was terrible. It sounded like it was recorded off of a muffled and scratchy old record. Very disappointing."
3,"Songs of the West, please, please?","I want to hold with the other reviewers, more Norman Luboff!!Specially Songs of the West, no female voices (sorry), just these deep male voices giving you consolation in these dark times!"
4,transfixed horror,"The deep sickness manifested by this kind of music can not be described, it must be heard. Norman Luboff had a talent for taking wonderful old folk songs and stirring spirituals, sapping the life from them like a vampire drains the blood from a comatose victim, and making them sound as if they were being sung by a church choir on quaaludes. Listening to it is akin to gawking at a traffic accident or a freak-show monster, with a reaction of transfixed horror."
2,"Interesting idea, bad execution","I have mixed feelings on this book. While the idea behind it is interesting, most of the book isn't. Many of the reviews are poorly written and don't offer a clear explanation for why the writer dislikes the particular album they have chosen. As with any exercise like this, some of the discs in the book deserve to be here, i.e. Trout Mask Replica (ugh), Rumours, Kick out the Jams, The Doors. BUT c'mon people, Pet Sounds? Blood on the Tracks and (GASP!), OK Computer?? These are GREAT albums. Oh well, I guess that's the point, right? At any rate, it may have been easier to take had the reviewers presented thier argument a little better. The appendix with the contributors own top 10 lists was cool though. Skip the purchase, get it from your public library."
1,As Pretentious as Some of The Records It Slams,"What a waste of space. Is there a point to this? Who cares what a bunch of snot nosed generation xer's think about music anyway...Sure some of these records are rightfully criticized but to the point of silliness. It comes off like Kid Rocks character in ""Joe Dirt""....""Def Leppard SUCKS!"" So most of it is drivel--crap--garbage.......Don't waste your money or your time...."
1,The worst crap i have ever read,"This is the worst book i have ever had to read. The author is an arrogant and single minded. I question whether he has ever even listened to the music he is reveiwing. I would give him half a star, but i am having a good day."
1,Jimmy DeRo is a Jimmy Morrison wannabe,"I knew as soon as saw the title of this book that DeRogatis, whose physique can only be accurately described as "" very obese,"" would be back kicking his fave dead whipping boy, Jim Morrison of The Doors. He does this every time he gets the chance, and if you wanna know why, well, just find yourself a pic of Mr. DeRogatis, and then take a look at any pic of Jim Morrison. DeRogatis even had the nerve to once refer to the late Doors singer's ""fat"" visage during his final days in Paris. Mr. Derogatis, even at the very end, Morrison was *skinny* next to you. Why not finally admit that your problem with Morrison isn't his music, but instead envy of his looks and his talent? You'll feel better if you do, and you won't need to embarrass yourself with books like these anymore."
4,superb critical corrective,"A smart, witty, wildly entertaining evisceration of the mighty rock canon...this kind of irreverant criticism is woefully lacking in today's rock-crit groupthink. viva la hate!!"
2,"GOOD IDEA, HORRIBLE EXECUTION","There's very little wrong with the idea behind this book -- questioning the canon is a valid exercise and one that's been going on in music, literature, painting, sculpture, etc. since the dawn of time. The problem with this book is that (barring a couple of exceptions) the writing is so damn bad, it obscures the point. If you're going to say you hate something, you'd better give some insightful, defensible statements to that end, and there is precious little of that here. It's like you learn in your first college writing course: you can start from any thesis statement you want, but if you base your paper on poor logic, cliches, and general banality, you not only fail in the exercise but are certain to lose the reader a few paragraphs in. Which is what nearly all of these essays do. Sorry."
2,Weak in all senses of the term,"A fine title but the book just doesn't live up to its own hype. The reviews are lazy and self indulgent with perhaps the worst offender being the dialogue between two writers dissing the Doors. (I wasn't actually aware there were any critics who liked the Doors and I dare say it would be more daring to mount a defence of them at this point but that's another topic...) The writers showing they are just as trapped in their own petty bourgeoise mythology as those they attempt to topple. The book seems another example of the sort of limpid navel grazing twaddle that mistakes itself for daring...this sort of thing makes one long for rigor, or Lenin even.(There is however one important exception, the demolition of U2 which while not exactly a tough target is done with the wit and verve sadly lacking in about every other whimper in this book.)"
1,A complete snooze,This book is incredibly tiresome. The authors seem more interested in cheap shots than a serious discussion of the music. They also seem to have a chip on their shoulders. Avoid this stinker like the plague.
3,Merely okay,"This book has a few excellent essays, most notably Dawn Eden's review of ""Smile,"" the legendary un-released Beach Boys album. Reviews of the MC5, Gram Parsons, and Public Enemy albums are also very good and insightful. Unfortunately there are also numerous poorly written essays, padded with details about ""why I became a rock journalist."" There is also a hard rock emphasis that dismisses Neil Young's Harvest, for instance, apparently in favor of Deep Purple. All in all, I would say save your money and ask your public library if they could order it."
5,"A ""must have"" book","This is simply a ""must have"" book for anyone interested in the dynamics of aircraft, flight control, and evolution of the modern aircraft. Airplane Stability and Control can be read as an aviation history book, as a compendium of the technical problems that arose in the development of airplanes, and as a manual for solving these problems. The book is a beacon that guides the design of new aircraft; it is technical, complex, and deep, yet it rarely refers to equations. It adds a much-needed dimension to the study of aeronautical engineering, which is increasingly focused on mathematics and numerical methods."
4,Excellent reference,"Excellent collection of lessons learned. Definitely a worthwhile reference to have on the shelf. Each chapter can stand alone, so read it cover to cover or just the chapters or sections that are meaningful to you.It is a little lacking in the quantitative data."
5,graveyard of honor,"this is my top yakuza movie of all time. whats even better is that its based on a true story. see the life of the most violent charismatic yakuza that ever lived. if u can handle the gore and nonstop violence, u shuld add this to ur collection."
5,Earls and Larry Chance Help you to Remember Then,Larry Chance and The Earls entertaining and brings back the 50's and 60's to life. Great Cd and great entertainers. See them Live if you get a Chance....
4,Arrangements of famous Orchestral/Operatic pieces,"Went to the local library in search of some Classical wedding/sacred music and checked out this book. It has both Mendelssohn's Wedding March and Wagner's Bridal Chorus as well as Pachebel's Canon in D. Like these pieces, there are a lot of arrangements of symphonic favorites - think a ""Greatest Hits"" Classical collection - but the quality is high. Most are moderate/advanced diffuculty- about the level of Thompson's grade 5 book, or Mozart's Sonata in C (I am a piano teacher). The original pieces for piano tend to be a little harder. The Baroque pieces (Bach, Handel, Haydn) are a bit easier.There is also the theme from ""Masterpiece Theatre"" (RONDEAU by Jean-Joseph Mouret)"
3,not too hard,"My biggist need for piano music bought online is to know exactly how difficult the music is. I play a lot of classical...this book has mostly pieces which have been transcribed from orchestral...such as adagio for strings. They are nice transcriptions, many not found elsewhere, and only of moderate difficulty (I actually prefer them to be a bit harder but it is by no means an easy or beginner book) so it is a good book for sight reading practice. There is out there the same book with easier versions of the music...I have forgotten the title. Nice collection."
2,Not so great.,"This toy is much cooler if left in the box. It is impossible to keep ol' mercury face on his board. Not terrible, not great."
2,Something's been erased,"Coming from a PG fanatic & one who fully respects Erasure, I appreciate Erasure's efforts to not stray afar from the original track and their efforts to keep things simple (vocals, rhythms, etc). However, life in this cover track as well as its variations is pretty much absent compared to the original. Everything in the original -- bass, guitars, percussion, keyboards, vocals, backing vocals, yelps -- contribute to a wonderful moment each time it's played. That moment's not found here."
5,Survivor Vanuatu,"Slowly buying the whole collection for my husband.He LOVES the show and watches these as he walks on the treadmill.If you're a Survivor fan, you've gotta have em!!"
1,WORST SEASON EVER! SKIP TO PALAU!!!,"say what you want about the winner in this one , I have problems with a winner that can't cross a bar without falling on his head ten times...yes I know Hatch was chubby too but at least he had charisma.I truely don't think the winner in this season can survive an hour in his life without a pizza.and to beat a 60 years old woman in challenges ? WOW ! what can I say ? great acheavement! well done ...I can summerize this season in just two words : the first one is JULIE, the second is BERRY.Probst unlike Clinton has great taste in women. WELL DONE BRO.Watch Palau instead. great competition and a worthy winner."
2,Box set cover COMPLAINT!!,"This season was ok, but would have been a LOT freaking better if they didn't put the final players on the cover with the winner at top dead center. Now that I know that, I noticed they do it with EVERY season! What the heck??That is an absolutely brain dead move by whoever greenlighted the design of these things. If you're not a die-hard fan with detailed memories of which seasons you've seen, you have to look at the box to know if you have or not. Once you do that- oops, you know who wins. There goes 90% of the fun of the show.Somebody out in movieland is in real need of a slap for stupidity."
3,Ami,"Ami was one of the most arrogant players ever, man or woman! She was definitely an attractive woman but incredibly smug."
3,"GOOD,BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH","I WAS HOPING THAT THIS WOULD BE THE UNCUT,UNCENSORED VERSION. MOST DVD'S I GET ARE UNCUT,UNCENSORED. ITS A GOOD THING SURVIVOR DOESNT HAVE RERUNS, OR I WOULD HAVE SOLD IT ALREADY, ITS A GOOD SEASON AND I ENJOY IT OFTEN."
3,One of the slower seasons,The characters in this season weren't as strong as they have been in past seasons. It was ok but a bit dull towards the end.
1,Too lesbian for my tastes,"This season is a complete bust for me. The guys (ALL of them) were complete idiots for voting off the strong ones too early - bringing about their self-destruction rather than their self-preservation. The women were idiots too - either being too smug (Ami and Leann), too lazy (Eliza and Julie) or too lesbian (Ami and Scout). Twila was the ONLY likeable one in the entire bunch - in the entire show!! Ironically, it was only the two openly lesbian members of the jury (whom I despised) who had the guts to vote for the best in the final two! I hated, hated, hated this season. I love Survivor, but didn't realize how much of a bust it could be until I saw this one. Truly awful - other than poor Twila."
1,Not the pictured book,I ordered this book because it matched my friends that the spine had broken on and i planned to replace it with the same book. It was the same book but the cover was different and not the pictured product.
3,Buyers guide,"I want a book that explains most in depth,but what I get is only an overview of all new bolt-on parts and a littlt introduction about the most important engine parts.If you are not so interested in analogised writing and only what nice pics and a good readable book this is your choice,but if you want all the in-depth infos your wrong buying this book!"
4,percy faith's delicado,love percy faith. this record has a good beat. it is danceable music. i really enjoyed it and sang along with it.
5,Music I Found By Chance And Glad I Did!,"This one i found in a used cd store, in one of its bins. not bad! Bruce Cox is a great drummer. Absolutely great! So tasteful, and melodic. And, like Peter Erskine, is a drummer who also write amazing songs! And wait til you hear what he and his friends do to some regular standards (like Rollins' Strode Rode)! This here recording is filled with wonderful improvisations by very talented guests: Ravi Coltrane, Donald Harrison, and Essiet Essiet (wow!) among others. This cd swings and jumps at you, right into your jeans and your hair and your office or house or room or wherever you are... you might find yourself tapping away with your toe, but beware, you might jump right up and start moving your hips too!! hey, why not, just don't say you weren't warned! Enjoy."
1,Waste of time & money,"The sensor arrived quickly, but does not function. I am buying the ac delco version since that is who Chevy usually uses for most of their electronics. I would not recommend wasting your time with this component."
1,really nice looking but poorly made,i have already had 2 of these controller and they both have broken. they are made very poorly and break very easily. do not buy this item.
2,poorly made no calibration,the calibration is very off. this controller is not worth $10.get something else. my waste of money is your gain of knowledge.
2,Disappointed,"The good: bought a pair inexpensively. Too cheap to pass by. Feels comfortable in my hands. Buttons are crisp and responsive. Cord is nice and long.The bad: D-pad is twitchy. Can't pull of combos in my fighting games because the D-pad rarely lets me input what I'm trying to input. I don't use the sticks very often, so maybe they'll give me problems as well with more time. Who knows? I don't play on using these controllers again anytime soon.I am (ahem) over 40; I'm a teacher (middle and high school) and have played video games with lots and lots of kids (before and after school) for over a decade. My students hate these controllers more than I do!! I've tried to make combos work, tried to adjust to these things, for a couple of weeks. My students (12-14 y/o) played about five minutes with them and then put them away. They won't pick them up again. Now, neither will I.Don't buy this model. Logitech I like. This controller I'm disgusted with."
2,Poor overall,"I bought two of these controllers a while ago. The buttons are slow to respond and the sticks drift. It's a very nice looking controller and I would still be using them but I can't abide the stick drift. I't makes games almost unplayable. Imagine if you will driving a car on a straight road and having your car slam into a gaurd rail without warning. I have the same issue with any 3rd or 1st peron shooters. If you can't control the players, you can't play the game. It wasn't gradual either. You go from a dead stop to running in a random direction. It got very annoying and became almost a struggle. Not only did I have to compete againt the game I now had to contend with the controller fighting me too.It's a nice looking controller and very comfortable to hold and use but it's inconsistent button/stick function leaves me unable to recommend this to others."
4,like it but ....,i like this controller but i wish the buttons were more sensitive. other than that its great.
5,A Great Escape,"If you're looking for a great escape--and who isn't?--escape into D. G. K. Goldberg's Skating on the Edge. Goldberg whisks you away to a fantasy land, where the real world is something to avoid at all costs, and deftly satirizes our culture with her subtle and sometimes not-so-subtle deliciously dark wit. Can cynicism and romance reside in the same place? They can in this book. I found this to be a delightful read, and as I said, a great escape. So get a copy of this book and go along for the ride. You won't miss the real world a bit."
5,A Genuine Original,"This is a very strange book. I give it five stars for originality and because I love to see a writer take chances rather than stick with safe predictable formula.But I have to admit it might not be for everyone. Fans of formula space opera or fat fantasy trilogies might find it too disturbing. The author doesn't cut the reader much slack. You have to pay attention and keep up. The weirdness input is intense.I don't know how to describe Goldberg's style. Neal Stephenson on some kind of very dangerous drug?A very different book, anyway. And very funny."
3,A Headache in the Pelvis:,The book is written to help you understand why the pain in your pelvis can be such a pain. The only thing that I found rather disappointing was that they waited to till 3/4 of the way thru the book before they let you know that you should really come to their clinic for a week to help solve your problem. Although it really implies that this is a self help book it is a advertisement for their clinic in addition. A book called the Pelvic Pain Solution by Dayne Herren gives you the same information but is a simplified form. He also has a relaxation disk which I use 2 times a day to wind down and relax. This is a key solution to both this book and his.
2,Be Careful- Look Before You Buy,"This book is possibly as good as the glowing reviews say it is for the lucky few, but for most of us it's not very useful. The authors spend most of the book describing what goes on in their clinic, while making it very clear that you can't treat yourself, and that there are almost no others who know how to do their program. Although most of it, outside of the internal massage, sounds like standard relaxation therapy, they assure us that it can't be learned on your own (... wonder how they learned it? ). Anyway, even if they do have a good CPPS cure, few of us can benefit, and buying this book isn't likely to help."
4,"This is a valuable resource for women, too","On the plus side, all the principles of self care and non-surgical methods of pain management this book describes apply nicely in self recovery. It includes some valuable stretching exercises and describes a cognitive behavior technique for dealing with pain that can provide a breakthrough. It also offers a discussion of non surgical methods for managing pelvic pain.Because of some mixed messages about relaxation tapes and some organization issues, the book would be improved with some professional editing.In general, the medical community perpetuates ignorance about pelvic pain and chronic pain and offers little help. The more I pursue pain management techniques, the less relevant this book becomes.SeeManaging Pain Before It Manages You, Third Editionand a physical therapist who can address poor body mechanics and decondition."
4,Helpful Information,"This book has assisted me in understanding some of the cause of my discomfort. I found the book a little difficult to follow, but after a few times reading the same thing it made sense."
3,Women need this advice too,"Just a quick comment: It is too bad that this book focuses primarily on males. Female pelvic floor problems are also described and occasionally dealt with, but it would be nice if future editions of this book contained diagrams or chapters geared toward women. Women suffering with these problems really need to know about these techniques too."
5,An extraordinary book that really helps !!,A Headache in the Pelvis which describes the new treatment for pelvic pain developed at Stanford University is the best book anybody could read who is suffering from pelvic pain.I have read all the editions and just finished the 4th edition which includes treatment for women as well as men. Wise and Anderson are the pioneers in this treatment. I can't praise this book enough!!!
1,Book Not Useful,"This book presumes all pelvic pain can be cured with relaxation and at the author's clinic with his brand of expensive physical therapy. That is inaccurate at best. The reality, I have learned, pelvic pain is a complex and individual problem and I think sufferers are better off spending money elsewhere than a book that claims to have the answers and doesn't!"
1,Train the Trainer. Faciltator's Guide,"The book is a good one but, be careful !!! It has only 183 pages and is useless without the Trainer's Guide of the same author that is NOT included with this book and is NOT included in the price."
5,beautiful doll,"My daughter loves this doll. She has had her for nearly 6 mo. and the doll still looks great. This is definitely a good choice for someone who wants a pretty doll, but doesn't want to pay American Girl prices."
5,GREAT!!,"This is a great comp. It actually features a rough, untitled track of Bright Eyes and one of my favorite songs that is dead equal with ""New Slang"" by The Shins for best song, ""Highlight Lowlife"" by Very Secretary. Get this comp if you want rare and gritty indie. It is does not disappoint."
1,USB Device Not Recognized,"That's the message you should get used to. There is some type of design flaw with the Titanium Cruzer. I don't know if the metal case is more susceptible to static discharge or what, but our university bought 15 for faculty use. 8 are still unopened, and of the remaining 7, only 1 is still functioning. Every one has died within 6 months, usually taking valuable files with it. We are also getting the ""run-around"" from SANDisk.Think twice!"
5,Rugged & trendy,"This is an excelent product. It's not only that is does what it is supposed to do, but it also has style and it's rugged enough for the most demanding user out there."
1,Disappointed,Worked only for a couple months (during which time it had to be inserted a few times to work properly) and then failed completely. Lost everything on it. Could not be formatted after that.
1,Returned once (Painfully) and the replacement is now broken as well,"I bought the cruzer titanium because it just looked so good. Finally, a seriously tough usb drive without a cap to lose, right?Wrong!This thing gave up on me 2 months after I got it, none of the machines I used it in would recognize it. After going through one of the worst return processes, the replacement lasted 2 weeks.I am an engineer and I give these thing a good workout, but I have cheap and even free plastic usb sticks that have lasted longer than the Cruzer Titanium did."
1,My Cruzer Titanium Quit after 6 months,"I lost all the important data between back-up. Cost me another 6 hrs. to redo my work. Of all the flash memory I have owned, none comes close to this poor performance.Tony"
2,"Mine died, too","Although mine is only a 512, I, too, have suffered from the mysterious sandisk cruzer death. I'd only had my 512 titanium for four months, and--literally--only used it about 8 times before the disk stopped dead in its tracks and my computer could no longer ""recognize"" it.I, too, am being forced through hoops by the Sandisk customer service/tech people. Although I've done their ""suggested reformat"" steps TWICE (although it's a bit hard to re-format a dead device ;-) and told them so, some clueless tech named Kirk keeps writing back, urging me to do the same pointless rigamarole over and over and over again.Frankly, if they do not tell me where to send this pathetic piece of merchandise for a FULL REPLACEMENT soon, I'll have to wash my hands of this company (but, you can be sure I'll tell my story far and wide).Beware."
3,"Mediocre, at best","Although the body is metal and seems stable, the USB connector is basically plastic and very fragile. It's nice not have a cap, but the retractible connection has gotten stuck several times and would be real easy to break. I haven't had a mjor problem, yet. Had it about 5 months"
1,Faulty Device,After less than one week of using this drive the mechanism that slides retractable USB connection malfunctioned. I do not recommend purchasing this product.
1,Piece of junk,This jumpdrive will not let you take anything off of it. We loaded some files once and now no computer will recognize it and the website says you don't need drivers to use it. It will not let you into it to see if the drivers are there. It won't let you access it at all. No wonder it was on sale!!! This is my first purchase on Amazon and potentionally my last! Very dissapointed!!! The only reason I gave it 1 star is because you won't allow a 0!
1,Worst USB drive ever,"I'm on my second one and it just failed. Don't buy this if you work on several different machines--it's really picky not only with regard to OS, but the way in which it loads a driver when introduced into a new machine. It just stops working--not only for that machine, but for all machines. I make daily backups but I still lost several documents the two times it failed. Customer service has replaced it, but I just can't trust the thing anymore--they won't let me exchange it for any other Sandisk product. Flash memory is not supposed to be this touchy. Don't waste your time unless you need a $100 paperweight (which gives you an indication of bulky the thing is)."
2,Fast drive but bad mechincal design,"Fast drive but bad mechanical design.This flash drive are nicely build, very fast write speed(~8MB/s).However, it is difficult to Slip out the retractable usb connector, need to try several times before it works.Also, the usb connector does not have cover, water and dirt can easily get in.I also have trouble with some USB ports, Not all usb portin my computer work with this drive.My other flash drive works fine with those ports."
1,More reliability problems,I RMA'd the first after 2 months (a hellish process) and now the replacement is shot after about a month. I'll be looking elsewhere for memory products after this.
1,Great Concept but not reliable,"I just had my second Titanium 1GB quit working. I'm getting the ""USB device not recognized error"". This was a replacement for the first one I bought which lasted about 2 months. I won't go into all the problems I had with the Sandisk support. I would not purchase another one of these as much as I love the form factor. My Sandisk Micro has been very reliable even after losing the cap to it."
2,Not Recognized,I like other reviewers am having this problem. This fancy little drive worked fine for 3 months or so but now it is not even big enough to become a paperweight. I'll go with Lexar next time.
1,Not physically durable,"Even though I liked the metal case since I bought it, it really only gave you a false sense of durability. Admittedly I have used it for more than a year now but initially when I started using it I thought the case could last much longer. The metal case looks really nice, and the painted words do not even scratch off even though I carry it on my key ring. But that's the last good thing I'd say about it. Eventually the case separated itself into two pieces, revealing some shoddy gluework between the two nice metal pieces. Now I have two nice looking and strong metal pieces for toy. I mean huh? 2000 lbs? I guess it was really designed to be strong rather than durable."
1,Garbage,"Complete waste. Great style, nice features, will work for about 3 months then not work at all, loss of data, causes computer to hang. Gone through two of these in 6 months, the replacement process with Sandisk is also a waste of time. Don't buy it."
1,Utterly unreliable,"Although I had no trouble with the 512k version, BOTH the originally purchased 1GB unit AND the replacement obtained (after much nonsensical folderol evidently designed only to discourage returns of defective merchandise) failed without warning within a few months' use. The company has refused to issue a credit or reimbursement, but did offer to provide a third unit without going through the previous completely illogical ""diagnostic"" procedures."
1,"Great Case, Terrible Electronics","My first 1G titanium flash drive failed in less than a month. The replacement failed in less than two weeks.I bought this drive based on the slick case, the reliability of my Sandisk 256M flash drive (still works great!) and a recent tech review on fast flash drives.Like other consumers in this group, my drive failed to be recognized by the PC after a very short time. I'm shocked that Sandisk hasn't resolved the issue. I'm annoyed that I paid a premium for a product that turned out to be total garbage.The Sandisk RMA procedure looks more professional than the execution. Replacements took months. Sandisk's customer support is terrible."
4,In the Handy Petite Size!,"This book contains a number of four-panel cartoon strips which feature the cast of the regular Oh My Goddess! series except that the goddess are are now approximatly the same size as rats. They prance through the book in their mini state interacting with crickets, slugs, and rats. While it's all very cute I won't reccomend it to anyone who isn't all ready a pretty big fan of Oh My Goddess! because it doesn't really make sense unless you're all ready familar with the characters. It doesn't really have a plot, but that's the way it's intended to be. Cute, funny, and short. And it has succeeded admirably."
2,Nice Idea,"I think this product is a wonderful idea. However, I had the smaller version for my dog and it only stayed put for about a month. The bottom portion came unscrewed and the paper with the information was lost. It is possible it loosened from her scratching or maybe I had a defective product. For the price though, it may be worth the risk."
5,Inspiring CD for Djembe Player!,"I bought this CD after reviewing many, many CDs highlighting the Djembe - I was looking for a CD I could play along with and that would be fun to listen to at the same time. I continue to enjoy the music and inspiration for playing the djembe when I listen to this CD!"
1,"Low Quality, avoid!!","Used it a couple of times and the battery was dead, everytime i changed the battery, it lasted about 2 weeks... even worse, after a couple of months the band lock broke. waste of money, and it didnt even looked that good, from the pictures i didnt realize this watch would look like a bracelet... you will regret this purchase, i know i do..."
4,My 4 year old loves these,"These are great toys for younger kids. My son absolutely loves these little characters. There are no pieces to become lost, and they are pretty sturdy. I can't wait to get some more characters for him, he loves reenacting scenes from the episodes. Great for imagination."
5,1970s Britcom at its best,"I only found this tape by chance (looking for videos starring Reg Varney) - the title of this video gives the two titles of the two episodes of this classic ""On the Buses"" contained on the video. If you like 1970s Britcom and double deck buses the ""On the Buses"" series is a must to buy."
5,Great gift!,"I got this gift for my mom for mother's day and she loved it. Also, since I couldn't be there for mother's day, I decided to mail it to her and the product was there just on time for mother's day. The company shipped it fast!"
5,Girls,Daughter bought this a was quite happy with it. Came in plenty of time and in the shape ~ as stated.
3,Great fun... for a few tracks,"I learned of the Torpedo Boyz through an Ursula 1000 mix. The song that was featured by Ursula was even better in its original form and there are one or two other gems, particularly ""Are You Talking to Me?"" But make no mistake, this is simply big dumb fun and nothing ground breaking. But sometimes, big dumb beats are just what you're looking for. Maybe seek out the best stuff on iTunes or find a cheap copy of the disc."
5,Fascinating Study of Psychology in Billiards,"A nice short little book concerning psychology and billiards. Several useful tables within the book. One of the best being the ""Probability of Having Various Length Runs."" It is a very sobering reminder of one's true ability and potential at any given time."
5,Friendly Purchase !,"One of my favourite stories of all time..... shared the DVD of this story (LWT series) with friend visiting from Oz last year; she was equally impressed. The book just purchased from Amazon is now en route to Oz, so she can recapture the story again. We were both ""children"" during the 1940's and can recall many interesting details as portrayed in the DVD/book. Thoroughly recommended to old softie romantics like myself - improved only by the reading of the sequel ""We'll Meet Again...The End of an Era"" What a great pity the sequel was not serialised for TV., LWT please note!"
1,Poorly designed,"I regret buying this shaker bottle because it is so poorly designed that when you take a drink, the flip top lid has an indentation that retains a small amount of the liquid, which then pours onto your face or clothing when you turn the bottle over to drink. The flip top also flips onto your face when you drink from it."
2,Zyliss 16 oz shakers,"Bought 2 of these. Big disappointment.1. Nothing to actually grip when you hold it; may work for someone with large hands, but certainly not someone with medium to small hands.2. You have to lift the big flip top thing to drink out of it; but then it hits you in the nose while your drinking.3. There is a little plastic wheel that drops down and works to mix up the powder; but this wheel is not easy to position, it falls through easily.4. Lid difficult to screw on; I find myself having to retry 3-4 times to get it to screw on tight every time. Annoying.Surely someone makes a better product than this!"
4,Great buy,"I was a little unsure after reading some of the reviews on this shaker, but it looked better that most. I have had 0 leaks with it after using it for 3 weeks or so, every day. The ""pop-cap"" snaps tight and the lid seals well. Be mindful, there is an O-ring on the lid that, if removed, could result in leaking. This may be why some experienced issues. However, it has working great for me."
1,Messy Messy Messy!,"I bought this product to mix milkshakes (just milk and powder). It took me forever to get the lid screwed on correctly, then when I started to shake it, milk went everywhere anyway because it STILL wasn't lined up right. I finally got in on there after about 5 minutes. It shook up the mix like it was supposed to. But when I tried to drink it, milk was in the lid that flips up and dripped down on my face. :( After I was finished with it, there was a lot of the milk still around the top rim of the cup where it is supposed to seal and I mean like at least a teaspoon or so... just stuck in there. It ran down the side of the cup when I took the top off. Also when I re-closed the sipper-lid, it pushed milk all over the top of the cup and down the side. Very messy. I didn't even bother to try to wash it. It was such a hassle that I just threw it away. Oh well. Ya win some, ya lose some. This one was definately a LOSER."
1,they leak,"Zyliss makes different Shaker with different color. If you didn't catch this review, it is just because this color is n/a. They all leak.After 3 months of daily use, I feel bad that I have another thing to full up the landfill."
2,"careful, it may leak","It has a terrible desing flaw. I use it to mix and carry protein shakes. I put the powder in, put the cap on and when i am ready put the milk or water, shake and drink. Too good to be rated 2 stars, isn't it? well that was the good.The bad is: the tread that hold the cap is inside the conteiner so when you mix, the mixture go thru the tread (it doesn't look nice), and it's supposed to be hold in by a clear tiny silicon-like band that is attached to the cap. If you tighten the cap too much, the band will be squeezed out of position and leak. If you do not tighten it enough the band won't seal and leak.Another thing, maybe not as important as the above, is that it is little uncomfortable to drink directly from the bottle, the lid keep closing everytime.So before you make your decision analize carefully. Despite all that.... It mixes, when you get it right(until the band break) and spray eventually"
4,Excellent...at first,"Well, this controller was pretty much the best thing I have used for the PS2 and I enjoyed it all the time; very comfortable and didn't make my hand feel cramped like the original DualShock that comes with the system. But, after a couple of months of play the L analog stick was always registering a right movement and every game I tried to play I could not stand still - I could move the stick to the left to compensate and that is all. Now I'm back to using the regular DualShock. Unfortunately, this item is no longer sold; I would very much pay the $15 for another one. The wirless version of this apparently isn't as good because of the inherent on/off of the button sensitivity, which makes it hard for racing games with require you to be able to control the throttle/brake."
3,Great item....at first,"To get straight to the point, this a very good controller in the beginning. After about two weeks,(maybe), the right analog stick started pulling to the right, which in any game is bad. whether u r playing a driving game or FPS this can be very damaging and frustrating. Since I have large hands the controller feels very good in my hands, a very nice fit, but the fact that it pulls and u can't sit still is a drag, especially in such a short time frame."
4,old-fashioned too,"I am not a big fan of romance novels, but I make an exception for Betty Neels - she could always be relied upon to keep it clean.Year's Happy Ending is a fairly good effort. Deborah and Gideon work for me - the sister's baby that is placid to the point of being semi-comatose, not so much.One reviewer stated that nothing of consequence happened in the book. I would have to agree - but that could be said of a lot of Betty Neels books. Her forte was not action or even suspense. When she was on her game it's all about the little things. Yes, she was old-fashioned and yes, she did tend to go on and on about domesticity - which is really rather endearing. I suppose that makes me a bit old fashioned too."
4,Finding love,"OK, the plot description is given in the editoral review. The professor is not a doctor, he's in finance and Deborah is a nanny. The professor, a widower, has a young daughter. Deborah marries him, and then they fall in love. One of the better stories from Ms. Neels and interesting in that the heroine comes from a loving family, and is not dirt poor."
5,So Sad When A Band This Good Breaks Up,"It's really sad when a band with such talent breaks up. I saw Watsonville Patio when I worked at a club in Clearwater, Florida; called Club Moore. I remember so vividly how just really really good they were. I even bought a CD and got an autograph. LOL I only had the lead singer sign it. Which I think pissed off the rest of the band. They have a myspace, but they don't really do anything with it anymore. I remember for years I tired to keep up with what they were doing. Apple studios I think was their label at the time. Then a recording that they had broken up. Any way really check out this album. My favorite song on it; well one of my favorite songs is Waves. One album definitely worth the eight bucks!"
2,Review for Kindle only,"I bought this via Kindle and am disappointed with the lay out. There is no link from the index and there are no page numbers so, you must scroll through the pages one by one to get to each recipe. I will be returning this and buying via softback which will be easier to use."
5,Good book if you are cooking for only one person.,"I didn't realize that this book was shipping from England and got nervous when it didn't arrive in a few days, but it came today and I think I will really like this book because the recipes all sound good and it even has a shopping list for each week with the recipes following."
2,"Not sure why, but it's not user-friendly","I've never made anything from this book. It just doesn't feel ""welcoming."" And nothing grabs me as particularly worth cooking. It must be the writing & presentation. Not sure."
2,To much wheat and soy etc.,"Sorry but I was dissapointed. To be fair I have been a vegetarian since May and decided to transition to a vegan. I haven't had much experience with vegan cooking so I sent for the book. There was a lot of wheat breadcrumbs , soy, soya sauce etc. I try not to use wheat because it is one of the number one allergy sources. I am not to sold on whether soy is good for you or not. I really didn't see anything that looked appetizing. I have tried a few vegan recipes on the internet like lentil loaf and lentil tacos and they were good. I just didn't see anything on here that looked good enough to try."
1,Not the real toy boy...,I bought this DVD looking for the classic 'Toy Boy' from the Wichita area television show from the mid 1980s. This is NOT it. This is a very poorly acted video and the Toy Boy voice and and character are NOT the original. It is a creepy Toy Boy puppet. Don't waste your money! I will be throwing this video in the pile for good will if I am not able to return it.
1,How did this guy get a record contract,"Yanni is the reason New Age died out. If you listen to his music, it is difficult to find any well defined melody; his use of chords is lame, and the changes are very uninteresting. After Linda Evans bankrolled him, she finally realized he had no talent. Yes, Yanni is a joke to REAL musicians"
4,Yanni is forever,"I have some of Yanni's other productions (Tribute, Live at Acropolis, and The Concert). This CD is a collection of some of his best music. If you are a Yanni fan, you have to have this collection."
5,The Ultimate of Yaani,This Dual CD package is simply fantastic. Good Quality and all in all a great deal. Will not hesitate in buying from this seller.
1,defective,"When I opened this 2 CD disk I found that there were 2 copies of Disk 2. The seller told me to return it for a full refund which I did on 8/5 via UPS. I tracked it and it was delivered on 8/10, as of today 8/29 I have yet to receive my refund. I know it was not the sellers fault that the disks were wrong, but I should have received my refund in a timely period."
3,Don't get this CD. Yanni' s still awesome tho.,"Yanni is awesome beyond words and so is his music!But...This compilation is well...worthless and redundant. In fact, almost all compilations are. This CD has wonderful tracks, but do you know how many times they have appeared in other compilations?Don't get me wrong. I'm still a Yanni fan. In fact, this is all BMG's fault. Yanni has nothing to do with these redundant compilations. BMG's just tainting Yanni's name.Once again, this CD really isn't worth your money. You need to get his origical CD's that he made himself. You can order them on yanni.com."
4,drinkin' hard in smoky bars,"an outstanding example of why the music some like to call alt-country or americana is so damn good -- this guy has nailed down the mournful relationship thing and actually sounds like he's lived some of this. But this disc is not just a country confessional -- there's plenty of humor here too, and some rocking, too. Texas Traveling Troubador should be a classic picked up by some of those older country rebel types. Easily could see Tom Russell (who's mentioned in the song) playing this one. Great artwork on the cover too. This might just be a little label offering, but these songs are in the league with the big boys. This guy can write 'em."
4,"Great, optimistic look at American civic participation","This book is a must for any waiting for Putnam's Bowling Alone. It is straightforward and honest--examining the data that does and does not support Ladd's theories. On the whole, it is a good source with excellent figures that leaves the reader with an optimistic outlook about our current situation as well as our future as a ""nation of joiners"""
4,Worth Every Penny If your a Fan,"The only reason why this doesnt get 5 stars is because it doesnt really have new material, just remixes and great videos. It is a much better purchase that the much dissapointing crap cd they put out a few weeks ago."
2,"The remixes were good, the DVD on the other hand...","I have been a fan of APC for quite a long time now, but watching this DVD has taught me one thing -although they make GREAT music, APC's music videos are complete crap. Especially the ones featuring the ""Bikini Bandits."" What were they thinking?!The one good thing about amotion was the remix CD that came with the DVD. Unlike a lot of remixes out there, APC's are actually worth listening to.My favorite song on this CD is the ""3 Libras (Feel My Ice Dub)"" but all are good and deserve to be listened to, especially if you're a fan."
5,Excellent Compilation; a MUST for Any APC Fan,"I don't know what J-po is talking about, because I haven't seen any of this stuff on DVD before, aside from The Outsider. More live stuff would have been nice, but any true APC fan knows that a proper live DVD is in the works for the future. I only wish they could have put APC's network performances on here, especially 3 Libras from The Tonight Show. To have APC's entire music video catalog on DVD though, is almost worth any price.All of the songs on the CD may have been released before, but not everyone is going to buy any CD that APC appears on (I love APC, but not enough to shell out fifteen bucks for one song). So the CD is a definite bonus for me.So overall, this is indeed a must buy for any true APC fan. Something J-po obviously isn't."
4,could of been better.,"This DVD isn't bad. It's nice to get all of their videos plus some extras. The commentary on the video is a nice touch and helps give a unique perspective into the filming process. It was also nice to see some live footage and to see the film contestants work. The main strike I have against it is the ""Bikini Bandits"" stuff. ""Thinking of you"" is a great song that could of had a creative video. What do we get? More Bikini Bandits. I don't know where this stuff came from nor do I care to know. The Bikini Bandits are a separate entity from A Perfect Circle and should be treated as such. They have no place on this DVD. The CD was pretty cool. I've never been a fan of remix albums but this was tolerable. I prefer the originals but it's fun to hear them from a different prespective. with that aside. Pick this up and check out ""Axis of Justice""(Maynard does some work with them)."
4,Why cant we see Maynard's face,"I'm a huge Maynard fan, and this video is cool and there aren't many videos of APC or Tool. So you might as well get this one..it's good. But for some damn reason Maynard has a thing about not showing his face and even when you do it's obscured by some effect.But really Maynard it's been years why the hell won't you give us one full concert come on...we've never even got one full show."
3,If you are a fan then buy it otherwise buy mer de noms,"The remix stuff was okay towards the end of the cd. At first it was like a damn dance remix album then they started to do the songs in different ways without makin it sound like a wannabe nine inch nails or bjork. The version of ""The Hollow"" that is sung by a female singer (not sure who) is actually the highlight of the album. I'd buy just for that song alone. This album was better the eMotive by far. I didn't like that one at all.The dvd is cool because it has everything that apc has put in terms of video... which turns out isn't very much. It's cool cause I aint ever seen some of this stuff. The whole bikini bandit thing gets kinda tired after a while. It was funny at first but... I don't know... it got kinda lame. Anyways buy this is you are a fan but if not I suggest you go with Mer de noms or 13th step. Those I guarantee you will love."
3,"Bonus CD, huh?","I would give this a higher rating if it weren't for the stupid, stupid, stupid Remix CD included with it. These are the worst remixes I've ever heard, and remixes tend to be terrible anyways. By the time the CD was over, I was almost in shock, amazed that these people could be evil enough to completely destroy these songs I love so very very much. The DVD itself isn't quite spectacular, though it's nice to have the videos at your command. Basically, if you choose to buy this, keep the DVD, but use the CD for a frisbee, target practice, or any activity that does not involve having to listen to it."
3,apc could do better,"well the dvd is kinda a disapointment, there should be more live stuff on it but its worth your buck because of the commentary with maynard, if your a fan of maynards you will appreciate it anyways despite the disappointing videos. the remixed cd is alright.. a couple of the remixes are badass like the one for judith, but there is a bunch of remixes for the same song... like there is 2 for 3libras and 2 for the hollow... and the 2 for the hollow suck! billy sings one and the girl sings the other, which she cannot sing at all! but like i said, if u are a true fan of maynard you will appreciate anyway..."
1,"I've tasted better, way better...","Major disappointment. Maynard's head has swelled to magnificent proportions thus he forced his band-mates into this pile of dung just because he can. Not only was this album/DVD completely rushed and way less-than-perfected, I found it odd that in a chat with Maynard on October 29, 2003 he stated the following regarding the 13th Step, ""I'm not thinking about that right now. I'm on the delivery table crowning ... breathing hard ... delivering my new baby ... and you're asking me if I'm going to have another baby someday"". But yet eMOTIVe was rushed to be released in time for 2004 elections.Maybe Mr. Keenan should heed his own advice: ""You are ALWAYS responsible for your own actions, so choose them wisely""."
2,Not much cop,"Think of the most pretentious thing you can, please. But think carefully. Think along the lines of that red haired woman who appears and talks rubbish occasionally on Critical Mass, or of Geraldine Doogue (sic) discussing the afterlife on Compass with some vicars (sorry, non Australian readers!). Then double that level of pretension and you'll be approaching the near toxic amounts of utter codswallop to be seen on this, Maynard James Keenan's latest excursion into the world of pointless obscurism. Look, matey, like it or not, this is Heavy Metal. Therefore I want, no I need, explosions, lots of lights, walls of Marshalls and some gratuitous blood. This has none of those things. Just a short little whiny man in a wig boring the pants off of everyone who comes into contact with him. Of course, if you're a fan, you'll lap up every second. But you'll get what you deserve. I promise."
5,...it just grows on you.,"....the more you listen to it the more you'll like it. I initially was a huge fan of the Tweedy penned numbers (with Laminated Cat and its nod to early Velvets a special favorite). After several dozen listens, however, I can't seem to get Open Arms out of my mind. I can't agree more with the earlier reviewer who suggested it sounded like something out of Meddle era Pink Floyd. Yeah, I see that, but with one caveat: Pink Floyd with Robert Quine on lead guitar."
3,Boss Tweedy and Friends,This is a very nice album but not a masterpiece. Tweedy and O'Rourke warp their own peculiar brand of old timey music into tribal beats and cotton candy weirdness. A nice addition to any wilco collection but far short of a legitimate project.
2,Not so much,"There are three Jeff Tweedy sung songs on this EP which is the reason I was interested in it, and being a Wilco fan, I didn't care for any of them. Laminated Cat has the lyrics from Not for the Season, but isn't as good as the demo for Not for the Season that I've heard. Chinese Apple has some of the lyrics from Heavy Metal Drummer and also isn't as good as that song. You were Wrong is the last song, & I didn't care for that one either. If you're a Wilco fan, you might want to hear these songs out of curiosity, but none are as good as the two other Wilco songs w/ similar lyrics, or any Wilco song for that matter IMHO."
3,OverIndulgent at Best!,A well intentioned album that is actually quite uninteresting.Minutes go by without anything really happening. The sad part is that I WANTED to like this album! Rest assured that their next offering will be the super album we all expected. Judge for yourself.....
2,3 star is generous,"Big fan of Wilco but can not get into this album. Seen many shows, New York New Years 05 was a real bummer for them as they crapped out a bunch of lame cover songs and this poor record. I only wish that the Flaming LIps closed the show as they were a blast!"
1,Very poor reprint - avoid,"Purchased the reprint available above. It came with 31 of the 300+ pages; in addition, the 31 pages were VERY poorly reprinted. Maps, illustrations nearly impossible to view, text hard to read. I would not keep this if it were in a pile marked ""free take one."" I did get a refund, but imagine such poor quality control extends the the other ""books"" put out by this ""publisher."""
2,Wrong picture This is not the chase version,I was excited to see that this version was offerd to find out i go the regualr version and not the chase version.Wrong picture is posted.
1,barry sanders,this is the wrong picture and the one i want is the pictured one!! i ordered three thinking it was the picture one. now i can't even find a way to get in touch with them to find out which one i'm getting
1,A sad waste of money.,"""Tell your story before others do."" ""Be available for interviews""Whoaa! That's it!Two common sense conclusions ... endlessly repeated in 214 pages of utter drivel.Do people really pay Sitrick for such basic advice? Apparently. He told us so!The problem is this - not one of Sitrick's clients has anything to hide. They are all squeaky clean with wonderful stories to tell if only they had the confidence to open up.How lucky he is. And how out of touch he is...Anyone who genuinely works in PR will cringe after reading this ghastly collection of back-patting anecdotes.Sadly, there nothing to be gained from this teenage diary. Except the discovery that some American business leaders are surprisingly stupid.Yawn. I am bitterly disappointed..."
3,refund,"received a refund with no explanation, can only assume that the tape was no longer available??? Quick refund though."
3,Great for indoor but poor choice outdoors,"Robeez are great for new walkers because experts recommend a flexible shoe that's as close to barefoot as possible. But suede bottoms are not good for playgrounds, and toddlers don't need shoes indoors. So we go barefoot inside and get a similar shoe with a thin rubber sole for outside. The Robeez are cute, but I really wish they had a better sole for walkers."
4,Nice Toon,No this album does not hold a candle to her 1st album but is a pretty good single that went to #2 on the charts.I am still a fan of hers but still where is the Old ChristinaLyrics 10 Style 7 Production 7 Overall 8/10
3,pretty Good Song,"I prefer this better than ""Dirty"".She has a Real Good Voice but Her Material overall tends too leave alot too desired.this song fits Her really well.good story&Message&Compliments Her Range&Tone."
1,american slut,"she was dancing and singing her brand new song ""dirrty"" in a exclusive London club very badly. After she drank eight glasses of russian Vodka, then she ran away to the stage & started to stand on the table and started to sing and dance.the alcohol impact was unfortunately too strong for Tina, that's why she laid down on stage, cause she was unable to finish her song. Her husband Jordan had slipped her away & brought her on his shoulder.....Dirrty and Dirrty !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Too Beautiful 4 Words,"What a thrill!!When i first hear this song,i can't believe that it is sung by Ms.Aguilera.When i realize that it is from her,i feel surprised that she is changing.She is more matured than before.When she sings this song,you can feel that she is not singing only,but she is telling us a story,a real story that happens in everywhere.Her vocal makes this song really beautiful and emotional.Once again,Ms.Aguilera proves that she is a talented and on-the-way diva.She is definitely outshining other pop singers,such as Britney & Jessica Simpson & not to forget Ms.J.Lo.You go,Christ!"
2,Boring!,"I expected an intelligent and interesting interpretation of Allen's major movies, but I got some highbrow gibberish instead. The author starts by talking about Allen's life (a short overview would in my opinion be enough) and then goes on to ""interpret"" his movies. In the first place, he quotes too much and commentates the statements that other critics have given about Allen's movies (he obviously lacks fresh and original ideas)... To make a long story short, it's an extremely boring book about an extremely funny and amusing subject."
5,Excellent,It got here very fast (concerning that it came from USA to Brasil) and the book is in a very good state.
1,NEVER BUY THIS!,"Basicly - this book is crap written by undereducated guy. Unsecure, unstructured code and unfinished ideas.Never buy it, try something else."
1,Spend your money on dinner instead of this headache,"The horror. The horror. This book is just a big disappointment. After 2 weeks of giving it a chance, I found out that there are several security holes in the php scripts. I will not reveal them here, but I will give you one hint: javascript. ""Secure PHP Development""...yeah right. This book contains mostly cut and paste scripts that haven't even been reviewed. Lots of redundent functions and script errors. Even worse, it violates the most fundamental rule in programming. That is documentation. There are no documentation in the scripts. You will have to enter them yourself. Oh, by the way, this framework he designed doesn't run on windows. It is written for Linux, although when you buy it there are no obviouse hints to tell you this.God help you if you buy it."
2,Very little about Secure PHP development,The book is not worth the retail price. I guess it was worth it for me since I got a used copy of the book. But this book is more about 50 random applications than about secure programming or writing better code. It would have been good if the book cut down on the application examples and maybe dump it somewhere online (only) and concentrate on making better programmers of the readers. Acutally a majority of the PHP + MySQL books today are not up to par. and that's being kind.
2,An Amateurish Curio,I am amazed this film is being offered for sale on Amazon.com let alone anyone actually buying it. It is nothing more than an amateurish curio despite some interesting comments about General Sherman. I could not understand why Mr. McElwee did not have the smarts to lay aside his camera while trying to win the affections of Karen. I'm sure his audience would have understood completely. Thankfully he did so at the end when he asked his music history teacher Pam out to a movie.
4,GROUNDBREAKING FILM,"The concept alone of this film is hilarious, and I think it paved the way for other personal documentaries. There's another film in the same genre called NOTHING that's also quite funny. That filmmaker has often been called a young, hip version of Ross McElwee."
4,Broken glass,"First, it took quite a while for my glasses to arrive. Like the other reviewer, I had trouble with breakage: one of the two glasses was broken on the stem. But I had no trouble with the quick replacement shipment, which yielded two perfect specimens of this gorgeous glass! My fiance and I will be using these to toast our wedding next year, and they're just beautiful for such an occcasion."
1,"Glasses are great, but arrived broken both times!","I have these toasting glasses already, and I love them. One of my glasses was accidentally broken, so I ordered these as a replacement. However, when I received them, both glasses were broken! I ordered another set and they too arrived broken! Ordering glass throught the mail is apparently not a good idea."
2,Beautiful but broken,"Purchased these flutes to use for our wedding. We did receive promptly, but they were broken (the stem was not attached to the flute). We returned to seller and received a new set, which had the same problem. In the end, we had to get our money back and buy flutes elsewhere. Perhaps this problem has been resolved by this point, but this was my experience."
3,Could have been so much MORE!,This gives the initial viewer a sense of what the original Beatles bass player was like. But I felt with all the exceptional interviewees that we would learn a lot more. And there just were NOT enough photos of Sutcliffe to see who he really was. The same old photos -- no movies exist of him -- at least that is what has been said. Astrid Kircherr took thousands of photos of him with the Beatles but has only released a few. For someone involved in this project one would have thought that she'd have opened up her files and show them.
5,Very good,I al french so my english is not very good.Thanks a lot for the quick sending.I like this movie.Perhaps I will buy others movies soon.
3,Joe Montagna and Mancini are great,"I laughed reading that last review, I also had small parts. I'm the red-haired female reporter during press conference where fight breaks out... Joe Montagna gets cold cocked and takes out a row of reporters! You guessed it. No they DIDN'T mention that part when they cast me and the ""hazard pay"" never arrived. But how many can say Joe Montagna fell on them? I also helped choreograph some fight scenes. BOOM-BOOM Mancini and ""Papa BOOM"" (his real father, former world champion boxer) are the funniest, sweetest people ever. This film is meant to serious, but it's just fun entertainment!"
3,bigger than thought,returned bigger than appeared to be not quite what i was looking for prompt return and refund
1,Won't stay in the ear,"I got this headset and promptly returned it. I tried the different sized earpieces that came with it, but couldn't get the thing to stay in my ear. It kept coming loose and falling out no matter what I did. I didn't really get a chance to see how calls sounded on it because it wouldn't stay in my ear to use it!"
4,Conair S3CS instant heat ceramic wet-dry,"I've had one of these in the past. Great product, but my last one only lasted about a year...hoping this one lasts longer."
5,just what i need!,This product is great! usually i dont have time to blow dry my hair and then flat ironing it.This is so two in one! dries my hair quick and straightens it quickly. It leaves my hair dry though but I use John freida serum and works great with my hair! so love it!!!!
5,Amazing!,"I bought this straightener over a year ago. I fell in love with it. I have very thick hair, so the high heat is awesome and helps with time. With flat irons I have spent well over $100 on, used to take me over an hour to straighten my hair completely. With this, 15-20 minutes and I'm set.I had to buy a new one though because suddenly it just stopped working after a year. I used it every single day, and even some of my friends used it. It would be on for at least 4 hours a day, so it had a lot of usage. But I'd rather spend the $25 on this for a new one every year than $100 for a top end one, that I never used because I didn't feel like spending 1-2 hours for my hair to be straight.Oh, and the curved plates are awesome too. I hate really stick straight hair. Giving the ends a little flip under makes your hair look naturally straight."
3,Great for straightening- not for curling,"Hi!I bought this product because I had a $25 gift card to use on Amazon and this was about that price plus S&H.; It's a good product. Clunkier and more dificult to handle than my old one which was slim and sleek and very light. This works great as a straightener. But I used to use my old one to curl my hair too... which I cant do with this one.It will do a little flip at the ends but nothing more. The curved iron is kind of fun though.Also, if you buy this with the intention of using with wet hair all the time to save a step by not drying your hair... you will be disappointed. It doesn't really dry and straighten at the same time. All in all its a pretty decent tool if you just want to make your hair be straight... but mine doesnt take much work anyway. It's fine and not very wavy at all."
2,from wet to frizzy!,"I was expecting this straightner to really wow me, but i was dissapointed. It took forever to dry DAMP hair and the end result was a total blahhhhh i would never repurchase! the curve plates totally suck as well! the curve plates are nothing but annoying make the drying process even longer. maybe this might work on somebody with really fine hair but for the rest of us ......... NO!"
2,Works...but not the best.,"This straigtner works as good as you can expect for the money. It is not very good with wet to dry, in fact I always wait for my hair to dry naturally now before using it. Using a straigtning cream or spray is a must because without either my hair is kind of brittle and sticky. I live in florida and I can say that these are NOT good for humidity because my hair usually ends up frizzy and curly after just 5 mins outside. I also have to re-straighten my hair in the morning after doing it at night because it just doesn't last. Mine are still working after 2 years, however which is longer than some, but I am currently looking into buying a better quality one that will stand up to the floridian weather."
3,Eh . . .,"It's all right. My only straight iron, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I can tell you this:1) It sometimes pulls hair out of my head, which I don't like, and2) The ends of my hair get damaged when I use it, and I always use a spray-on protector with it.I thought these things were supposed to be better for your hair than curling irons, but this one isn't."
1,Stopped working right away,We purchhased the straightener in February and it stopped working by March 15th.The warranty is only 30 days so we are out of luck buyer beware!
3,Okay but not great,"I previously had a Remington Wet 2 Straight straightner, it was absolutely amazing! The conair is okay, it does heat up really fast but it does not dry my hair (I have really thick hair) like the Remington did. Also the curved plates are nice but does not really work on stubbornly straight hair! So if you have really thick hair I would not purchase this but if you have thinner hair I think it would probably work."
2,smelly,I got this as a gift. The red coating has worn away and it really smells when you heat it up and it makes your hair smell really bad. I desperately want a chi!
4,"Review of Conair S3CS 2"" Profesional Ceramic Wet-Dry Straightener, Black and Red","Love this product, bought two to keep when one fails. Only wish it would last a bit longer than it does."
3,gets the job done okay,"I bought this when my CHI died. I didn't want to spend a bunch of money to replace it so based on the reviews I thought I would give this a try. It's no CHI but it gets the job done. It heats up quickly and straightens pretty well. The only real difference is that it doesn't curl as well as the CHI. Overall, it's worth the price and I'm not disappointed."
1,Safety hazard!,"I have had this straightener for a couple of years now and have liked it, but recently when i plugged it into the outlet, there was a loud popping sound and a spark flared (from the outlet) causing me to have to reset the outlet. We just built our house last year and honestly I wondered if there was a problem with the outlet (however I've never had a problem before). The straightener still worked, so I continued to use it, although it made me nervous. A couple of days ago, I turned it on and this time a loud popping sound and a flare came happened within the actual straightener (where the irons are) and it died. I searched online to see if there had been a recall, because obviously this could be a safety hazard. I haven't found a recall but saw that another reviewer had the same thing happen. I wouldn't recommend this straightener due to this safety issue. I noticed it's no longer sold at Target where I bought it, although again I bought it two years ago or so."
3,Forget not the past...,"For those of you that might say as 'conspiracy Garbage did when he said: to think somehow pedophile priests must be part of a Satanic conspiracy takes a huge leap off the deep end.I ask this: Are these the same RCC priest's who, for over 600 years killed anyone who opposed their believes? So they can, as history records, kill people in the most grusome and unimaginable ways and prolong death with tortures that even Hollywood can not imagine, yet to you, pedophilia by these same sick demonic men is a huge leap off the deep end?I say the apple does not fall far from the tree."
1,Total Insanity,One would have to take into account that Satan does not even exist. This is the biggest bunch of 'conspiracy crap' I have ever read. Save your money. And to think I went to school with this guy!!
5,A great book for parents and coaches,"The story of a season with its ups and downs, The Beautiful Game is great not just as a story about 16 girls and their coach, but also wonderful insight into the psyche of teenage girls. As a future teacher and coach, it gave me a lot of insight."
5,A must read for parents and coaches!!,"If you parent or coach a young girl playing competitive soccer, you must read this book. The author opens the door to the environment that creates champions both as individuals and a team. He also made me a fan of THUNDER SOCCER. I will continue follow their exploits."
2,"disturbing character, but kids love it.","My son loves this video, but I find the character Francine a little over the top. She is just plain mean!No adult ever questions her behavior,which I find disturbing. I prefer the other Arthur videos.This one makes me nervous!"
5,FIND IT CHEAPER OFF AMAZON,"As I write this review, Amazon shows the book as out of print, with used copies running from $25-300.YOU CAN BUY THIS BOOK DIRECTLY FROM THE PUBLISHER (greeninteger.com) FOR ONLY $10! Don't sucker in to these jacked up prices. The marketplace sellers are trying to rip you off.That aside, this is a wonderful, expressionistic mini-tome with haiku-like meditations on cinema as perplexing visual art. Highly recommended (but only if you get it for a reasonable price)."
4,A haiku-like glimpse into the mind of a great director.,"The random, notebook quality of this book is what gives it a certain charm. It's quite like Bresson's films: full of hints, suggestions. The notes are study in how a director thinks through the problems facing him. The scrapbook quality of it shows a mind with firm beliefs, yet always searching. Reveals that the artistic life is a work in progress."
4,A sparse little quote book.,A decent window into a masters mind. Not as exhaustive as I would have hoped.Don't expect a great read. Just a little advice book from one of the greats.
1,Not what I expected,"I imagined this book would comprise an edited collection of notes or series of essays on cinematography. It is, however, merely an (apparently) unedited compilation of disparate notes and observations taken from what must have been bresson's scrapbook or notepad, the sort of thing that would make sense only to the author. It is entirely without textual comment or organisation, and I found it quite useless. Nice for the dedicated enthusiast, perhaps."
1,Let's not forget about Author's past!,"This Mr. Krakowski was a political officer responsible for communist political propaganda in Polish People's Army until 1966. His wife worked in KC PZPR (Central Comity of Polish Communist party.) He was a part of of the most brutal and inhumane regimes that ruled Poland after World War II. Among his friends were human beasts like Jakub Berman, Jozef Rozanski-Glodberg, Jozef Swiatlo-Fleichfarb, Helena Wolinska, and Salomon Morel. I am not surprised that person who actively participated in extermination of the best Polish patriots wrote a book that has no historical value. It not even a fiction! It is propaganda in its worst!"
4,a surprise,"A beautiful and worthwhile book on Maria Callas, in a sort of guise of coffee table tome. The ivory flap cover is almost Raphaelite, but it's the photos inside really worth the price of admission. The text has little that's new. Pieces of Callas' private diaries and letters provide a unique, not extensive glance at her private life, forming at times a melancholy sense of a tenuous woman's personal fears and difficulties. Refuting a rumor that Meneghini wanted her to stop singing altogether, she denied that was his view, saying ""It is not his view, because if it were I would never have sung again."" Some interesting bits on Elsa Maxwell, who was apparently in love with Callas, and some of the finest photographs of Maria I've seen anywhere. The book is a genuine homage to her art, and there's nothing cheap or filler about it. It's an experience to dominate any Callas lover for a few hours, and the kind of book you can return to repeatedly. Molto recommendation."
1,"Beautiful photos, bad book","Although the book is laced with some lovely, rare photographs, the text itself was written in a shabby, European ""giallo"" format; the translation is clumsy with many typos and ridiculous titles such as ""The Callas Age"" rather than ""The Age of Callas."" Many of the stories are unfounded and somewhat sensational, and the knowledge of music history that is published here is less than erudite. I sold it to Strand for $3."
4,"...Snake, Rolling in Hot...",This was written by my cousin who told me about it. It was very interesting and maybe a little too detailed for me? I did enjoyed it!
2,Not for Contractors,"Good for bikes basket ball and toy inflation NOT FOR ANY SERIOUS USE Go for the Makita 6.2 cfm 3 hp 5 gallon tank unit it is twice the machine for around $ 50 dollars more, you wont be sorry!It can run two nail guns driving 3inch coated ring shank nails. THE OTHER IS FOR HOMEOWNERS"
2,Great Compressor at First,"I was looking for a compact compressor to carry on trim jobs and after extensive research, settles on the MAC2400. I have read the reviews about damaged units from poor packaging and was a little concerned with this but was pleased to see that Makita has fixed this problem. Arriving three days later, the compressor looked in pristine condition. The break-in went without a hitch, but things went down hill from there. After the unit cooled, I discovered that the crank case cover was cracked and the air regulator was broken.Amazon handled the situation incredibly well, refunding my purchase the same day.I went with a smaller, oil-less Dewalt the second time around.Hope this helps."
2,"Cool, but wish I could return it!","Cool, Cool looking, great size, but I can't even blow out the garage floor without it turning on all the time, pump up tires, etc. My fault, but I still think if you own this HEAVY compressor you should at least be able to use the air gun without a recharge every minute. better for quick things than constant. HEAVY and LOUD."
4,Great Compressor - Bad User Manual,"This was the first air compressor I have owned. I bought it to use in my garage for small projects. The strong, quiet low-RPM motor is perfect for my DIY home projects. My only complaint is that Makita includes a terrible user guide to get you started. There are virtually no diagrams and the ones that are shown are vague and unhelpful. There is an air filter that comes loose in the box but nowhere in the manual does it show how to attach it. After a call to a friendly factory representative, I was able to get my questions answered.If you are experienced with using air compressors then the user manual is probably not that important, but it kept me from giving this otherwise fine machine 5 stars."
4,very good,prosgreat air flowstable base wont tip even in your truckVERY QUIET 1700 rpm motorconsthe only one is 77lbs its heavy
4,Everyone else was right,"This compressor arrived within three days of my order. The air filter riding in the loose bag of parts had a nice dent, but otherwise everything arrived safely. This thing is heavy, but extremely quiet. We were using my son's DeWalt twin stack to re-roof my house. It was not only noisy, but tended to walk itself into corners. The Makita delivers sufficient air to run two staplers, doesn't move an inch, and is not nearly as loud as my 12-year old daughter. And Amazon gave me a nice discount for the dented air filter, which I repaired and used on the unit. This is my first Makita tool, and they are only one packaging engineer and one tech writer away from a 5 star rating."
5,Great Compressor,"After doing alot of research I settled on this Makita- I have to say the reviews are right- its quiet, and yes heavy, but you can feel and hear the quality in this machine. I don't intend on moving it around much, I was concerned more with noise and build quality, both of which are superb on this model. I had bought a craftsman compressor and returned it because it was a piece of junk, and came out of the box dirty and didn't work- I'm guessing it was a refurb. Anyways, this machine is great, I highly recommend it."
3,value play?,"beware design feature flaws!the airfilter assembly conflicts with the plastic engine cover as well as the oil filler cap.I can't completely screw on the airfilter assembly because the engine cover is in the way as well as the oil filler capI also cannot remove the oil filler cap because the airfilter assembly is in the way...WTF!instructions are vague.drain valve lever was loose.on/off switch seems ""ill conceived""I knew this compressor was a ""value play""...Design flaws like this are unacceptable in this day and age."
2,Awesome compressor while it worked.,I would have gave it a 5 star rating but after three years sparingly used it started having problems with pressure switch. I did not bother contacting the Makita company because it has been three years so I tried to fix it myself. I would by this model again.
4,Lost a star for the tiny tanks,"Really nice unit. Well made and takes up little room under my workshop bench. It is pretty quite for a compressor. Pumps up fast and empties its tanks just as fast! So if you just want ""some air"" for blowing out that carb you're rebuilding. Blowing down the workshop bench pumping up the kid's bike tires... its great. It will be fine for housework running a trim nailier and light spay painting. If you get into ""Real Steel"" forget it. My 3/8"" air ratchet had it ""flat"" in no time. I bought it as a ""fill in"" for housework, knowing I would have to go big to run my steel working tools. Makita if you're listening, please build something with a BIG TANK for us guys that don't have to walk around with it all day. More power. More power!"
3,Good compressor,"Its quiet, recharges fast, and portable.Buyer beware: Do not follow the setup instructions included in the user's manual! It makes NO mention of removing the air intake plug and installing the air filter. Make sure to do this step before the break-in! Not sure how they could have missed this.."
4,Startup Amps a bit more than 12.3,"I purchased this compressor in hopes that my Honda EU2000i would power it at 6500 feet in altitude for building a remote cabin. The Honda did push it when the starting air pressure was zero, but started overloading on replenishment. From my calculations, it takes about 2000 watts or 16.7 amps start-up current to run this compressor which makes sense since it does have a 2.5 hp motor. The motor will use about 1750 watts of power (14.5 amps) when it's about to hit 120 psi.I couldn't be happier with this compressor. It powered my framing nailer, roofing nailer and palm nailer with ease. It's performance was very acceptable.The MAC2400 is very very quiet compared to others I've had. Just be warned that the claimed amps it needs is really about 15 and not 12.3. I'd recommend."
5,Great Compressor - You Won't be Disappointed,"After reading the reviews on several compressors, I ordered this one around 3:00PM and it was delivered about 9:30AM the following morning, using Prime next day delivery.As stated in many other reviews, this is a well-designed and well-built compressor, and it is heavy. I expect this compressor to last me many years.The required compressor oil was included and the instructions for the short break-in process were clear and concise.The compressor was immediately put into service to build a storage shed. It worked exactly like you would want a compressor to work, plus it is quiet (very quiet for a compressor) and ran my nail guns as expected. I've had it run on several of my electrical circuits (15 and 20 Amp) and haven't had a breaker pop once."
5,What a quiet compressor!,"This thing is awesome! I'm switching from a 20gal belt drive oiled Ingersoll Rand that was actually too big for my needs. The Makita has about 1.7cfm (@90psi) less output than the Ingersoll, but so far the additional air isn't missed. Neither is the noise. Both the Ingersoll and the Makita are much quieter than the oilless Craftsman I also own, and the Makita puts out the SAME volume of air as the Craftsman, but MUUUUCH less noise. I'm working in an enclosed box truck with this unit, and neither the ""note"" nor the volume are bothersome. It has a nice low pitch, where as both of my other machines sounded frantic. Just get one, and have a nice, quiet day."
3,"Nice, but slightly damaged","I did a lot of reading reviews before buying it and was amazed at the consistant comments about damage ""during shipping"". Mine arrived dented on the front between the gages, however it was nothing that caused any malfunction, so I realy don't care much, EXCEPT...I honestly believe the company shipped me a compressor that had prior damage. There was NO damage to the shipping box what so ever, so it had to be placed in the box that way. I think somebody knew they were doing it, and that's proabably how they can sell them cheaper than other companies.About the compressor: it runs quiet, no leaks, gages and regulator are good, heavily built. Great for inflating tires, using nuematic tools etc., but NOT good for using a blowing tip (even a small one) to clean off mower decks, blow out engine air filters, etc, because there is not enough volume in those small tanks and the pressure drops quickly and I have to wait for it to build up again."
5,Great Product,"This is by far the best compressor for the money. Reading the reviews from other folks, I was worried that the air compressor would be damaged since there were so many complaints on packaging, but it arrived from UPS in great condition. Yes, its a bit heavy but it's not something your not going to walk around with. Air pressure builts up very quickly and its very quiet for being a air compressor. This is for sure a must for every guy that has air tools or even a small workshop. I have the neighbor kids always coming over to pump up there bicycle tires."
5,Very nice Air Compressor,"I just got my Mac2400 last week. The box had 1 hole but there's no damage to the machine. The air compressor was well packaged and there's an air filter and bottle of oil inside! It's a solid machine. I think it's a very good value for the price. I poured in the oil and started it according to the manual. It purred quietly! This thing is a lot quieter than the cheap little air compressor (no air tank) I bought to inflate my bicycle and car tires! The only thing amiss is that the manual should have an instruction to attache the air filter before start up. Yes, it's a little heavy to lug around but it feels solid. 5 stars so far. I'll deduct later if there's any problem."
4,a tale of 2 compressors,"Seeking advice as a first time user of light air tools,my brother , who part times a motorcycle shop, suggested a huge noisy Campbell Hausfield, with piping and couplings everywhere.Not an option for a small pottery shop.My choice was a small ,quiet compressor, but the concern was it would need replacement or repair.Makita is inexpensive considering the extremely long life-if you pay attention to the service schedule.It is unbelievably quiet and takes up almost no space.I thought I might break off fins or filters but it is a protected robust design. For brad nailers, tire inflating , a series of airbrushes and HVLP guns-this compressor does not even break a sweat.At 70 #its rather heavy to hop up and down stairs so it sits on a small dolly and takes an extra length of hose every so often. No matter.It has done great service in the year I have used it.Update to Jan. 2013: everything I have said before in spades!"
4,Extremely quiet,I am very impressed with how quiet this compressor runs. A negative is that it weighs a lot and is difficult to move around. We built a cart for it and we are very pleased with its dependability.
5,Ditto! great machine,My first compressor and I feel wise for getting this one.I've been using it for hardwoord floor installation and so far it'sbeen flawless.
4,"""A charming true story""","This book is amazing. First published in 1981, it's the story of a Western African, Kpomassie, who as a teenager reads a book about Greenland, and it becomes his life dream to go to there one day. It takes him 10 years of working odd jobs across Europe to slowly make his way to the arctic country where he becomes an instant celebrity. The pictures of him in Greenland are wonderful. It's a charming true story."
2,"Good premise, but didn't quite live up to expectations","I loved the premise of this book, and couldn't wait to read it with my book group. However, the book itself wasn't as good as I had hoped. I lost interest before the halfway point, and struggled to finish it."
4,David Mack's story... awesome! Kevin Smith's... not so much.,"I read the original Kevin Smith story in Marvel Knights Daredevil when it first came out all those years ago. Never didn't really finish it. I now remember why I didn't. It's not that good. It's kinda silly and the main villain's (not gonna spoil who it is) reasons for doing what he's doing to Daredevil and his friends is very stupid. So meh.Why did I give the trade 4 stars, then? Because of the amazing David Mack (of Kabuki fame)story, featuring Echo. David Mack knows how to write people, and in his story you can see it first hand. Echo falls in love with Matt Murdock, but the Kingpin, who has raised Echo since his father was murdered, orders her to kill Daredevil. She doesn't know the man she loves and the man she has to murder are one and the same, though. Very cool story."
2,Just another system,"The author does a fine job of presenting his system, however, he forgets to explain how he goes about his analysis. A comprehensive book would inform the reader how the author conducts analysis. Besides, one would expect for the price of the publication, a print date of Jan 2001 may offer an updated version of the original print: no luck. Much of the print dedicated to computer application uses old Lotus language - it is clear this edition could care less about users in Jan 2001 - it also seems to pass over the 90s as well. In all, it seems the author presents his notes on a system of looking for cycles, but the path is not clear and the guide not up to date. I am a commodity hedger and I find little use with book."
5,Full of Insight,"The King of Deer is absolutely full of information about deer behavior, deer management, and random things that I did not expect would be in the book. The deer management is geared only towards large ranches in Texas, but even in Northern Minnesota I can make use of the the knowledge a gained from this book. One of the unexpected sections of the book is about velvet and what causes velvet to grow, die, antlers drop off, and restart the next year; the little random info like that makes this book 10x better than I expected."
1,Amazingly obtuse,The author takes a variety of vague and nebulous social constructs and attempts to redefine them in order to reach preordained social and poilitical conclusions. The book is unbelievably overblown and could probably be summarized in a few pages.I can only assume that the author has now moved on to writing government regulations.
1,Wishing I hadn't wasted my money!!,"A writer? I don't think so. I was truly disappointed in this book. What a joke! Poor writing style...poorly written...grammar is horrible...!Please don't waste your money, I read the other reviews and thought it would be a good book...WRONG!! Terrible! I will stick with Danielle Steele and not bother with these wannabe's! Like they say, anyone can write a book, few can write a good book, AND THIS AUTHOR FALLS UNDER THE CATEGORY...ANYONE CAN WRITE A BOOK! My four year old can tell a better story!"
2,Nice heavy cord,"Hello, I purchased this cable when I purchased my generator and also a purchase the box they will all togetherThe cable it's not compatible with my generator the cable heads there will not fit on generatorThe electrician guy told me the sarong cable I like to return it and get the right cableAnd this mistake it's not my fault I ordered it under package deal"
2,Not good for sensitive skin,I purchased this product after I had used a sample. Once I started using for just a few days my sensitive skin had a reaction. I actually had to return this product. May be good if you do not have sensitive skin.
4,"A little complicated to set up, but fun once it is going!","It took me about 30 minutes to work all the air out of the system. You've really got to squeeze and rub all the air off the jellyfish. Use a chop stick or straw and work them, you can pull the top up a little bit and then use the stick to turn them upside down and all around to let the air escape.If you take the lid off completely, use the stick or straw to move the air off the bottom of the pump when you turn it back on, before you insert it into the tube, that way you don't shove a bunch of air down to the bottom of the tank and back under the jellyfish.Once you get the air out, those suckers really move around.The only bad part I see, is that the pump runs intermittently. They should have it run continous with a little less current, and hopefully it would be quieter.All I can say is, don't give up on the set-up, I know it is frustrating."
1,Piece of trash,"I am VERY disappointed in this toy. I bought one for my son for Christmas from Santa Claus, and we set it up, and it does not work. The jellyfish just float at the top and do not move at all. It was a BIG waste of money. Don't waste yours on it! This product should get NO stars, but the review site made me at least enter one star for each category just to get the review posted."
1,HORRIBLE!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS ""TOY""!! We're pretty savvy in our household, and set this up correctly. The above reiviewer is right - the jellyfish floated at the top, looking dead! Which is exactly what my five year old suggested must be wrong! I only rated it with one starr because .000001 star is not an option. I hate that toys like this are sold - it's disappointing for everyone. Hope you save yourself the aggravation and find another educational toy that's lots of fun."
1,Piece of junk,"Even with the soap trick, which will work for a few minutes, the jellyfish get trapped in the corner. What a piece of junk!"
2,These jellies are all wet!,"I bought this jellyfish tank for my son, who is fascinated by them. Well, it took a few days to finally get the jellyfish to ""swim"", then after a few days of my son enjoying his tank, the pump no longer works. He still asks me everyday why it isn't working. I think the motor is too close to the water line and maybe water got in there and burnt it out. Don't waste your money! And if you are thinking of buying this for a child, DON'T! Their disappointment outweighs their excitement!"
3,Too much bag,Bags are sturdy but too big for a std res compactor. No bag ties either. Ordered only cuz local stores discontinued.
1,Almost a dollar a bag that you put in the trash ?!?!?,This apply to all trash bagI think it's time for America the recycleAlmos a $1 a bag that you put in the trash each time
3,"GE bags, really?","Six years ago, when we purchased our GE Monogram compactor, it came with bags. They were very thick, the bottoms were pleated for perfect fit and they had holes for the ""buttons"" on the sides to keep the bags from sliding when compacting. For a couple of years, we could purchase similar bags from GE, but they were pretty costly for such an item. What has happened, GE? Thinner bags, flat, with no holes. It was a lot of work to make the bag fit--well, almost fit. Half the price, I have to admit, but then, you get what you pay for. I am tempted to order directly from GE and see if there is a difference. I am wondering if GE provides these bags of poorer quality so they can be sold cheaper. (I used amazon, because it was easy. The bags came quickly, no complaint there.)"
3,Not the best...but beats the GE price!,"The price of the GE refills for our Monogram Compactor is almost offensive. The cost of the unit alone was hard to swallow, I refuse to allow GE to soak me for the price of their bags. These aren't the best bags out there, they tend to sag and fall in when they get near the full mark. But, I've never had one break, they're tough, the fit ""okay"" and the price is a whole lot better!"
3,Fit the compactor...,"Our trash compactor is so old that the bags are hard to find and very expensive when you do. These fit the compactor (a Compactall by GE) and seem to be study enough to not rip apart when we compact cans, glass, bottles, and other items that when compacted and broken create sharp edges. There's bound to be some poking but with these bags it's minimal."
4,Water water everywhere,"After contimnating my 12 year old Shurflo fresh water pump , I decided to buy a new unit. As Jabsco seems to be a market leader , I decided to change brands. The new unit is made in China unlike the old unit made in the US. I was found the installation to be easy as the mounting bolt pattern is identical. The picture is incorrect as the unit does NOT have right angle fittings (only straight ones).They are available. Not sure about the claim that an accumulator is Not required as I've never owned one. The pump is working smoothly. I hope it lasts at least as long as the old one."
5,Entertaining for Mommy too,"This is the funniest Sesame Street DVD I've seen (we have at least five). My 18 month son loves it too. Cookie Monster's running commentary kept me chuckling. True Cookie Monster's poor grammar is a little irritating, but his comical delivery is worth it."
2,Not the classic Cookie Monster I was hoping for...,This disc is FAR from having Cookie's best bites! The skit w/Anette Benning is just barely tolerable. Not at all what it advertises. Too bad.
5,Very funny for adults too!,"Of course, when you buy videos for your child, you know you'll have to watch them too. This video is funny! My son loves cookie monster so I figured this would be a good video. My favorite part is when cookie monster is baking cookies and opening the oven every 5 seconds saying ""cookies done yet?, cookies not done yet."" Just wish this tape was longer like the Elmo tapes. Elmo gets a lot of tv time, why not the other characters of Sesame Street?"
3,not impressed with this one,I could think of many other clips that better show cookie monser in action. It is alot of the old clips form the begining of Sesame St.
5,Cookie Monster Mom,This dvd is perfect for my Cookie Monster obsessed toddler. I only wish it were longer. It arrived very quickly with ground shipping.
4,A not-bad video for Cookie Monster fans.,"While this pales in comparison to ""Big Bird Sings"", there are some classics found here. Of course, ""C Is for Cookie"" is here, but that's on a lot of other SS videos as well. This is basically for the die-hard SS fan, or for those who just love the Cookie Monster. END"
3,A fun DVD,"If you're just looking for a video that is fun and entertaining for your kids, this is a good choice.Not so energetic that it gets them too wound up, but upbeat enough to hold their interest and make them giggle.There are a few songs to dance to, and all in all, some of the best Cookie Monster skits you'll find in once place."
4,"A few ""scary"" scenes for a very young viewer","While my 15 month old son quite likes this DVD, there are two clips with a night time/dark background that we have to skip to avoid crying."
4,Truely ELITE!,I found this book to be very helpful and accurate! Elite is a very fine agency! The tips were very good and got me on my way to a better me!
4,"Sexy,Sexy,Sexy!!!","Joanie Laurer is a very sexy woman. I have both issues playboy that she appears in (infact those are the first and only issues of playboy I've ever purchased so she has to be extra sexy for me to buy it). Most playboy models are just beautiful with big boobs. For my taste, that's not enough for me. I like ""thick"" healthy looking women like Joanie. She looks good on paper and even better in motion."
3,sword and sorcery sex,I liked this show for the most part. i'm not a wresteling fan but i did like this lady after seeing her in a couple of different places on TV. I like brunettes and she is/was just built with muscles enough without going to far. when I saw this program advertised i had to see it. the program had some dull points but seeing ms. laurer nude was worth it. great body and the show had nice costumes.
2,Not What I Expected,"Chyna looks great but this is a behind the scenes documentary and nothing more. The behind the scenes, behind the scenes is better (if you see it you'll know what I mean) Die Hard fans only!!!"
3,Neat introduction to Dora for us,"Over the years I have seen bits and pieces, but never really watched Dora. Now that I have a toddler daughter and a newborn girl it only makes sense to have an introduction to Dora in our house probably to be watched over and over again. I have to admit that her voice is not exactly fun to listen to, but an energetic character is okay every so often. Also the pausing for replies from the watcher is a bit offsetting at first and does not quite capture my toddler's attention, but there are majy more years where I believe she will be quite interactive with it."
4,for your little ballerina,cute for ages 3 to 7 and for that little girl who loves ballet movies this is perfect! very cute
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"It's a nice connector. It connects and wires the way it is supposed to. However, there is no way to eliminate the feed back caused by a new radio with internal amp without re-wiring directly to the speakers, which eliminates the need for the main connector is this set. So, its a nice product but it does not truly serve its purpose in this model."
5,totally awesome live,"I love the new Tori Amos cd to say the least. I think the two best songs on the new alblum are riot proof and Datura. But my favorite is the live version of Waitress, I mean I was totally blown away. I have never heard Tori rock out that much man it was sooooo cool."
2,"no, i don't think so...","The music is remarkable. I hurriedly rushed out to buy this, and I'm glad I did for the 2 live tracks. However, when I read the lyrics to ""Bliss,"" I was nauseated. Why would she ask her father if he is ""a hot kachina who wants into mine"" and discuss tasting his ""supernova juice""? Tori, please, show some restraint."
4,"Off to a great start with ""Bliss""","""Bliss"" perpetuates Tori's unique sound with a very moving and catchy chorus that will haunt your mind for days after first hearing it. The new album is off to a wonderful start with this beautiful and powerful song."
5,Buy it!,No other recommendation is better suited to the release of this single from Tori Amos than BUY IT! It's the best 4 bucks you can spend!
4,Tori is back and I like what I hear,"From the opening piano beat you know this is Tori Amos, and that's a great feeling since this is her first piece of new music in over a year. ""Bliss"" is a terrific, haunting tune that hooks you and gets more enjoyable every time you listen to it. Tori's new album should be something to look forward to this fall."
3,Sinead O'connor anyone?,"I love Tori's music, but the first time I heard the opening of this song I couldn't help hearing the similarities to O'Connors ""You made me the theif of you heart"". It's all in the begining Piano. I do like the CD, but I wish Tori would go back to her Little Earthquake, Under the Pink sound."
1,Utter Crap From Previously-Brilliant Tori Amos,"Tori Amos sinks lower and lower into her depths of sell-out, you can almost feel how desperately she secretly (or not so) wants to become a mainstream radio hit. With songs like Bliss and 1,000 Oceans she rehashes topics she's already addressed before in an unoriginal way, lowering her previously high standards of cryptic and interesting lyric writing and intuitive, brilliant piano composition. I don't begrudge Amos of her want to get radio play and more wide-spread acceptance, but if it means she has to abandon what was once an original outlook on music to pay for her new kitchen, I wish she's just starve for her art. Chalk it up to Amos fans, self proclaimed ""Ears With Feet,"" to make this a hit."
4,Awesome Fun!!! But.....,"Bought Singstar this weekend and it was SO MUCH FUN!!! My husband and I laughed ourselves silly and just had the best time singing with the videos and competing against each other. SO...why did we return the game later the same day??? There just aren't very many songs on the game AND there aren't any other game packs with more songs. I also have to agree with everyone else that the deal with the microphones only working on THIS game really sucks! HOWEVER, if they put out a couple more game packs with additional song titles, we will definately be purchasing this again. We bought Karoke Revolution instead but we definately prefer the Singstar game."
3,Singstar is no Karaoke Revolution,"I bought the game b/c it came with 2 mics for $50. The mics do not work with K.R. My other disappointment is that when you sing you do not get the moving line graph to show your pitch. It just puts dots and dashed where your pitch was, which makes it harder to control your pitch. Karaoke Rev. is easier to for that purpose. Otherwise, it is not a bad copy of a karaoke game."
1,worthless game,Problem loading the game after first try. Would never purchase this again. It is a waste of money.
1,Should of read reviews first,"We should of read the reviews before buying this game. On the surface the bundle pack looked promising: two mics with the game. However we were disappointed that the game is nothing like a karaoke experience.The major let-downs include:**Mics not compatible with the karaoke series**Hard to improve singing, the videos distract from following the pitch levelCannot mute the lead singer's voiceHard to hear your own voice, the song drowns out anything from the mic.Small cool-feature: able to play-back your voice recording. But you still have to hear it over the song and lead singer.The interface is easy-enough to follow. We started a battle without any problems.The song track is OK. Enough to not get bored.We are embarrassed to be duped by the marketing, next time we will do the research first!"
1,Waste of money,Unless you listen to a lot of rock this game may be fun... THE MICS DO NOT WORK FOR ANY OTHER PS2 KARAOKE GAME!!! Karaoke revolution is a lot more fun and easier to sing to...
2,Unimpressed,"I purchased this game bundle because I enjoyed playing my friend's ""Karaoke Revolution"" game, and I thought this would be equally enjoyable. First off, the microphones only work with the Singstar games, which is a bit of a rip-off. Second, the game isn't much fun. In challenge mode, you have to sing along with the person you're up against, which isn't as good as singing solo. There are no extras to unlock, either. The playback feature, where you can listen to your version of the recording you just sang, is nice, but overall the game is quite limited in its appeal. It held the attention of my group for less than an hour before growing stale. Purchase one of the ""Karaoke Revolution"" games instead."
3,Fun game - slim selection of songs,This game is so much fun! The only complaint I have is that there are only 30 songs. It seems like you keep singing the same songs over and over so after a while it isn't as interesting.
5,Awesome Singstar,I order this Singstar for my daughter. She has loved it. The item came in no time after I ordered it. It was a excellent item to order.
3,Its OK,This game is not as fun as karaoke revolution. On karaoke revolution you unlock things and create your own avatar. This game you are singing to the actual video. You cant even hear your voice very well.
3,good fun,"Good family fun. Everyone liked the game and had fun participating. Although we played with adjusting volume it was often a bit difficult to hear your own voice especially in playback function. Teenager was disappointed in song selections, and I was somewhat. For ""Rocks"" there didn't seem to be that many rock songs. Also would be nice if there were a larger number of song selections or at least the ability to earn more songs."
4,singstar bundle,The kids just love to sing and have fun with their friends. even the guys have been involved in the fun. I have seen alot of laughs and giggles more than anything else.
1,Drying Moisturizer,"I have combination/oily, sensitive skin. I have had acne problems in the past. I love Boscia products for the most part. The cleansers and toners are great and worth the price. This moisturizer is not. It dried out of my skin, especially around my chin, nose, and eyes. I discontinued use after about a week. It feels like it is sitting on your skin instead of sinking in and soothing it. Made make-up difficult to apply. The only plus+ to it is that it didn't cause me to break out ... but dry skin is just as unattractive as pimples in my book."
2,Very Lightweight and Setting has cracks,"The Silver is paper thin and the setting has little cracks which cause the ring to hook on fabrics. Poor customer service, I returned the product and they never issued a refund and they never responded to my email inquiries."
