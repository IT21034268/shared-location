3,"Interesting, but not what it claims to be","This book is not what it claims to be. If I know what my passion is, I will pursue it no matter what and I don't need Richard Chang to tell me how to do that. If I don't know my passion, this book sure is no help in finding it."
5,Powerful and Practical Plan for Passionate Living,"With The Passion Plan, Dr. Chang has succeeded in providing a solid approach to cultivating the energy and focus needed to pursue one's purpose, in a powerful way. A must read for entrepreneur's. This is a business book, dealing with a critical aspect of business life. The world depends on our ability to passionatly create and recreate great business every day, every hour, every minute. The worksheets are invaluable. They really set this book apart from the more purely inspirational. We will use The Passion Plan in our annual planning process, both for our own business and with clients. Great resource for coaching one-on-one or in groups. Thank you Dr.Chang. We finally, have a resource that presents passionate living as one of the many business skills needed by those who plan to live great lives,on purpose both personally and professionally."
1,noisy noisy noisy,"Bought this unit for the bedroom......and it seems to have only 4 settings noisy, noisier, noisier yet, noisiest.........I returned mine"
5,Comico y entretenido,Este libro es una descripcion muy acertada de los contratiempos que encuentra una mujer moderna en el mundo profesional. La sinceridad e ironia con la cual la escritora nos narra su vida cotidiana esta llena de semblanzas a ocasiones que todas hemos vivido.
5,"So much fun, they don't realize that they are reading.","We have been big Pilkey fans for a long time because Captain Underpants books (along with everything Pilkey writes) are superlatively, pants-wettingly, silly. I give these to all my nieces and nephews, friend's kids, neighbors.... because I am a big fan of kids reading, and let's face it, a book has got to be pretty entertaining to distract kids from staring at TV or computer screens. It also helps that Captain Underpants books are so gross and anti-establishment that they feel deliciously naughty to read. God Bless Dav Pilkey for making reading fun."
5,The sixth book of CAPTAIN UNDERPANTS,"This about the school brainiac (Melvin) turning himself into a bionic booger boy. Now see what happened was he tried fusing himself with his bionic robot by using his new invention (The Combine-O-Tron). But righ before the invention was about to do its thing ,Melvin sneezed at the last second. So the invention fused the robot,Melvin, and the snot that came out his nose. In the first book, this used to be about two kids named George and Harold who made an underwear hero out of their principal by using something called the 3-D hypno ring so remember everithing I just said."
1,Filthy,"If you want your kid walking around with a filthy sewer mouth and playing practical jokes on the principal or mocking the ""nerds"" then this is a fantastic book."
1,Stinker,"It's weird. I mean, the charaters are bad. I like the funny stuff, but, you get the feeling that for once, you want the bad guys to win."
1,Captain Underpants Lost Its Humor,"I'm a huge fan of the Captain Underpants books. Ever since the fifth book came out, I've been dying for the sixth one to come out. When I finally got to read it, I was disappointed. First of all, George and Harold's teacher is now extremely nice. She was much funnier when she was extremely mean. Second of all, Melvin's hamster is now a regular in the series. New characters always make things worse, even if it is a hamster. Third of all, the book focused too much on Melvin. Not enough George and Harold."
1,under wear man,This book was cool because if you had a guy in town that flew in his under pants that would be awsome. And how cool would that be if you a giant robot whit bogers all over so now you now ho cool this book is.
4,Tra-la-laaa!,"I have two boys, 6 & 7 who have loved the cottony-captain for two years now. Both have been reading CU on their own since 1st grade. We have them all in their goopy, gross gloriousness. They're always good to go back to EXCEPT they are poorly bound(I mean the paperback ones) and fall apart and ours are all taped together. Boo for the binding, yahoo for the silly content that keeps two wild things still enough to read."
3,FLYING IN THE SKY WITH A UNDER WEAR CARLOS.,I THINK THIS BOOK IS COOL FOR KIDS OF 5-10 CAUSE HAVE FUN PARTS AND HAS GOOD PICTURE AND IS A FUNY BOOK FOR THOSE KINDS
4,Cool,"I thought this was a good boook, but I don't like the flip-O-ramas. The bad spelling and grammer makes it relly funny! I say you should buy it."
2,Maybe the best....or worst....,"I love the Captain Underpants sereis, especially the Proffesor Poppypants one....but I am not sure about this one. I got it yesterday and skipped threw it not laughing once out loud or in my head. This might have to be the worst Captain Underpants to come out.... (although the name is very clever ;-) ) If you like the Captain Underpants series, i would recomend you read 'The Day My Butt Went Phsyco' by Andy Girfith."
2,Will Stick with the Peanut Butter Molasses Ones,"I bought these to save a few bucks, (why do the PB/M ones cost so much more?) but my picky little rescue girl won't eat them. She loves the Peanut Butter and Molasses ones but unfortunately, in the assorted flavors there are hardly any of those. Now I've got a case of them that will be donated to the local shelter."
5,Best Cookies Ever,"My dogs go absolutely wild for the Blue Dog treats. I get the assorted flavors, and there is not one that doesn't get inhaled. I find them easy to break, but I'm just not fast enough for the pups. I think they could eat a whole box in one sitting if I let them. These are simply the best treats for your dog."
3,Mixed review on these,"These arrived quickly as I ordered them on a lightning deal. They look fabulous, they smell even better, they were fresh, they were attractive looking...................the problem? My 2 Yorkies won't touch them........sniff them and then walk away........even cut up in little pieces. I'll have to give them away unless I get desperate for cookies and decide to eat them myself!"
5,Paddington's Number 1 treat!!,"Paddington enjoys the variety in flavors as well as the size of the treats in each box. They are also a low calorie snack...we all have to watch the pounds! Purchasing on Amazon not only saves me money, but keeps my cupboard full of hard to locate Blue Dog Bakery treats."
1,Great price but dog wouldn't eat them!~,"Great price but dog wouldn't eat them!~Blue Dog Bakery Natural Low Fat Dog Treats, Assorted Flavors, 20-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)....they're also hard as bricks!~"
1,"well, that didn't work!","I was looking forward to providing these treats to our two small dogs but made the mistake of buying six boxes because I thought my dogs would 'for sure' like them based on the reviews. They ate them for a few days, then I started discovering them around the garden. Unfortunately, they didn't like them. Others have written about how good they smell, that they crumble easily etc - I don't think they're any different than any other dog biscuit. They're large, but they break into pieces just fine (without crumbling). I'd suggest you buy a single box to see if your dog actually likes them."
1,sad face,i was so excited to give these treats to my dog. she only nibbled on it for a second before walking away from it. she doesn't like any of the flavors.
3,treats fall apart,My golden is a finicky eater and didn't really care for the treats. He seems to like the soft treats better than the hard ones. And when he does eat one of the treats it ends up in little pieces on the floor.
5,Favorite cookies!!,Our dogs LOVE these cookies. A favorite treat that I feel fine giving them. Very natural and healthy without worries
5,Best Dog Treats,"These dog treats are wonderful. I have two Shelties and my daughter has two Shiba Inus. All four just love these cookies. All I have to say is ""Cookie Time"" and they come running. Thanks for a great product."
5,"Great treats, even better price!","I have purchased the Blue Dog treats for my two Huskies, who absolutely LOVE them. While any treat is excitedly accepted, they are especially happy when I give them these particular cookies. Not that I can blame them; they smell good enough for humans! I also really like the fact that they are made in the US. My dogs do not get any stomach upset with Blue Dog, something I can no longer claim about Milk Bones. The monthly shipment, or in my case,6 week shipment, ensures that I won't run out, and the price buying in bulk makes these treats very affordable.Thanks Blue Dog, we love your company!"
5,A Fun Way to Enrich Your Science Curriculum,I teach in a Montessori classroom and am always looking for new ways to make learning fun. This is a great book! It has helped me link music and science together. The concepts in the songs are sophisticated and interesting. The text is informative and funny.
3,Not in the condition it said,"I bought this book in good condition, and it was fair at best. I thought it came with a cd or tape, but it was only the book. I don't know all of the tunes, so I will have to research them. It was a cheap price, but I am not happy with the condition."
5,Excellent Read!,"This novel is an excellent read on African American history and ancestory in the Old South. Totally engrossing! Ms. Tademy also is the author of ""Cane River""."
2,Huge disappointment,"I stumbled across this author's first novel, which I loved, purely by accident a couple of months ago. After I read it I looked her up and found out that she had since had this one published and I rushed to buy it. Huge disappointment. I've only gotten a hundred pages into it and it may turn out to be worth the effort but so far I can't get interested in it. It's as someone else said -- it doesn't even seem to have been written by the same person."
2,Not like her first work,"I must say this book is not a page turner like Cane River. I started reading it in 2010 and today I am only on page 147. However, in between I have read 23 books. So it is basically going on a year. I will keep and recommend Cane River, but this one is totally up to the reader. Maybe I'll pick it up again in a few months and try one more time to finish it."
2,Disappointing Second Novel,"Very simply put. Does Not live up to Cane River...in fact, the writing is so dissimilar that it doesn't even seem to be written by the same author. I thought it was borderline horrible. Sorry!"
2,Little Character Development,"I think I am the first to give this a low review. While I admire author for tackling such a huge story, there was little to no character development. This story follows 3 generations and just as you really start to get into one generation, you skip to the next. The unfortunate thing is that 2 characters of the story survive for at least 3 generations yet they were barely mentioned after the first third of the book. I would have rather the book be written in the first person of these two characters. I wanted to like this book, but I just could not."
4,My book club approved,"This was a selection for my multiracial multigender highly educated book club and we all enjoyed the book. And we all finished the book. It allowed us to discuss a variety of topics including race, race relations, slavery, family connections, history, the inaccurracies of history as it is reported in the US, gender roles, and a variety of other things. It is a great read for a book club."
4,From agony to equality,"The first half of Red River contains alot of horror, brutality, and despair. I would not recommend it for pre-teens. It is a true story of how the hopes of Reconstruction yielded to the realities of white supremacy in Louisiana in the ""Jim Crow"" period of 1873 on.But the second half of the book tells a more hopeful story of how the black community around Colfax, LA clawed its way out of despair through hard work and education. Lalita Tademy writes with passion, and she uses real events and the history of her own family to add impact. This is a good novel, probably better than Cane River, her first book. While Tademy is not yet a brilliant literary stylist, she tells an important story in a dramatic and effective way. It is worth reading."
2,Started out as a page turner-fell apart quickly,"The fictional recounting of the historic events of 1873 that provide the basis for the novel was great. The reader felt very much a part of the scenes around the Colfax court house. Once that scene passed, the book droned on for hundreds of pages with little stories about various family members to the point of utter boredom. I was waiting for a riveting ending but it just abruptly ended. Big disappointment, for sure."
5,Incredibly Moving Tale that Ends Hopefully,"RED RIVER had me weeping almost from the first page, and yet left me inexplicably hopeful after I'd read the final sentence. A multi-generational tale that begins with the Colfax Riot of 1873 and ends in 1937, it was, for me, an eye-opening tale of courage and violence, love and community, and the necessity of dreaming for ourselves and for those who will follow us."
5,Good Read...,"I haven't had the opportunity to read this yet but if you loved Cane River, then i believe you will love Red River as well."
2,Bad News,"When the package containing the Skil 9350 reciprocating saw was opened I found two small pieces of plastic in the bottom. I couldn't determine where on the saw they belonged. Next, when I attempted to insert the saw blade into the saw I found it wouldn't allow the blade to be inserted. It was advertised that the saw came with two blades but only one was included. The saw was returned for a refund."
3,Good exercises,"This book has good exercises in it. Although I wish they were a little bit better organised, maybe according to muscle groups. I do like how it includes balance as part of the workout.The thing about this book that I did NOT like is the ""New Age"" section in the back. Instead of a genuine look at nutrition, there is a description of a lifestyle called ""Ayurveda""--which promotes vegetarianism, and is more astrological than scientific. It seems inappropriate to include it in this type of book. I would have prefered something mainstream."
4,DVD about Wales,A historical narrative of Wales. The dvd is in good shape and I would recommend this program to friends and family.
2,crap-tacular,"rated for 230 watts? hmmm. I find it hard to believe that any computer is going to push that much wattage through a USB. Still I managed to blow-up the pair I recieved within a week. On the plus side however the sure do look sharp sitting on my desk, and they certainly were easy to use and install. I certainly wouldn't recomend them, unless you need some cool looking paperweights."
5,Speakers are still sounding Great!!,I bought these speakers a year ago! Very good sound quality and I have no complaints! Very pleased with my purchase. Always shop amazon!!!
4,Work in the shower,"We have uneven tile (not smooth) in our shower, and unfortunately only one place to put toiletries. I didn't want to buy anything permanent, because we will be updating this bathroom in the next few months, so I needed something that would hold up some suction cup trays I bought at BB&B. I use four total on each tray and they hold up beautifully. I think two would probably be enough for the weight, but the shape of the trays need two to keep them from tipping forward and back. I recommend these if you have a bathroom that won't take suction cups. Make sure you give them several hours to stick before you add weight, because they seem to do better that way. However, they don't stick to latex paint very well."
4,Does job,I would purchase this item again. Command is a solid product as a whole. Will be interesting to see how this items fairs in a wet environment.
1,wheres the factory test?,"You would think that a well known successful company such as HP would test there products pass standards before selling them. They forgot to do that with this particular dvd writer. It simply doesn't recognize any disc and it's likely a missed hardware malfuntion. Yes I did troubleshoot, until I won an award and was proposed local work for the Sheriff. I got six months out of it and now it's only use is contributing to the unique junk stack on my bookshelf. Yes it will die, No do not buy. It is your choice, you've heard my voice. This poem is gay, please have a good day."
2,it's okay,"I thought there would be more to this film, but it's only a compilation of fly-by shots of different parts of the Holy Land. There's no dialogue, no interesting facts, no stories, no scriptural attachments...only footage with text here and there (indicating where one is)."
1,I didn't like it.,"It's been a few weeks since I listened to the CD, but I remember I didn't like it at all and threw it away. I believe it was because there was singing on all the songs and I wanted instrumental music only."
4,"Very nice as ""cliff notes"" for anatomy classes",This book is a handy quick reference. I used it when teaching anatomy & physiology labs and during anatomy classes. Also an excellent quick desk reference. But you might need a magnifying glass to read the print if you are over 40.
4,nice book,Nice book. I bought the book used and it was a 'VERY' used book. The book was dirty and wrinkled. But a good book.
4,One of William's Finest,"Since this was his final recording for Cadence, Williams was able to sit in the driver's seat, resulting in an album he could truly call his own.The accompanying artists read like a ""Who's Who"" of music greats including pianist Dave Grusin, trumpeter/bandleader Quincy Jones and arranger Billy Byers who later worked for Sinatra. Furthermore, Williams brilliantly employed French musicians including a string section that is ""soft & airy, like Debussy.""A happy-go-lucky mood is interlaced with the melancholy. Williams sings ""Let it be Me"" with a tenderness missing from the Everly Bros version. My favorite track, ""La Valse des Lilas"" (The Waltz of Lilac) is as lovely as it sounds especially when sung au Francais. And with Williams' great diction, you can understand each word. The recording culminates with ""Au Revoir, Paris"" --très approprié.Although I was disappointed to find only one French-language song, Under Paris Skies is a great example of Williams' prowess as a vocalist."
1,I need some real reviews before I buy this product!,"I have not tried Zetaclear, but that company sure seems to dominate the internet with their fake ""customer"" reviews. The guy above is no exception. Click on ""See all my reviews"" after the name above: ""David Morrill 'Educated Buyer!'"" (Charlotte, North Carolina). I have a feeling he works for the company that makes Zetaclear and Hoodia. And all his reviews are glowing and written the same way. I have not been able to find any REAL reviews on Zetaclear anywhere online. Seriously, they all appear fake, and even the so-called ""articles"" that recommend Zetaclear on various websites appear to be paid by Zetaclear. They will all have a Zetaclear ad or link that takes you direct to purchase it. Buyer beware!! Maybe it works, but without any real testimonies, I am not about to try this product. There are more real testimonies online about using plain Tea Tree Oil and/or Apple Cider Vinegar for toenail fungus, than on Zetaclear."
5,Great product!!!,I love bowltrol! I instantly had a flatter stomach! You have to drink 60 oz of water a day or you will get mild cramping but not bad. If you stay on top of that you should be ok! I only take 3 pills a day & don't up the amount & that is good for me. I go 1-2x day & feel so much more refreshed & lighter!
1,Intense Cramping,"I bought this on the internet hoping it would be a healthy thing to do. Instead, I just experienced some really bad cramping that I never had before. After going to the doctor's he told me to not use this brand of colon cleanser. I tried to return it but never heard back."
1,Bad Cramping,"I was just looking for a cleanser to help impprove my health. I have tried a few brands, experimenting but this was the only one that actually caused me problems.I had a lot of bloating and cramps with this product. I purchased it on ebay but I dont think I will buy there anymore.I can not recommend this product."
4,I love this stuff,"I started using this stuff to clean the pipes. As im getting older its harder to use the bathroom & this stuff is great. Again some people can use it & some can not. Always try something once & if it works for you stick to it. If it doesnt try another thing until you are happy. Simple & to the point, it works for me."
1,Bowtrol Sucks!!,"I ordered this 'Colon control' product recently to reduce my diarrhea with IBS. The product made my symptoms worse and my stomach was so sick for a week. I had to wait for 3-4 days to get it off my body. DO NOT BUY this product. I am now trying to return it. Recently, I tried something else that is helping me hugely - COCONUT oil. I heard from a friend that the medium chain fatty acids MCFA in coconut oil is anti-viral and anti-fungal. I am having one spoon of coconut oil everyday and I am so much better. You can also use it in cooking since it stands high temperatures better than vegetable oil. It does have saturated fats - but no trans fat and it is proven to improve hdl (good cholesterol)"
3,COUNT YOUR CAPSULES,"I like the product, it works for me. I order and reorder it;however, I noticed that the capsules didn't last an entire month. So today, I opened a new bottle and it only had 48 capsules NOT 60. I had another bottle not opened, opened it, counted the capsules and ONLY 48 in that bottle too. COUNT YOUR CAPSULES."
1,A WASTE!!!!!,"This game is not worth the money wasted, it has no camera to know where you are going. Also you go through the same patterns all through the game. It is a game that when you try to get the support it claims for help YOU WILL NOT GET IT. Also I think who ever created this game should stick to coloring books because you sure don't know know anything about making a game. You waste people money and time. Your Spirits & Spells does not have a walkthrough because it a real boring, stupid game. I even had to put a 1 point star to get this in, But my opinion it's a -100."
5,My baby loves this,I started using this book with my daughter at 12 months. She was adopted from a foreign country at 10 months and didn't understand a word we said to her for many weeks. I used this book series together with Baby Signing Times DVDs for excellent results. These books are among my daughter's favorites. She brings them to me to 'read' to her all the time. She really loves to look at the pictures of the babies and I think she even understands some of the diagrams showing how to make the signs. At 18 months I have seen her sign 52 signs. It is amazing and heartwarming to experience her successfully communicating with my husband and me at only 1.5 years old. I highly recommend this series. Great product.
3,Old but in good form,"The book came in good condition, it is an old book but is clean and in good form"
5,Adventurous & Fun As Well As Funny,This game is Funny...A True Point & Click Game...The interface is easy to use. I found this game to be so much fun......Strike this up to a Wonderful Classic!!
5,The Best Bread Book I Have,I've used this book for 20 years and love it. My brother has taken up bread baking and this book is his Christmas present. I was delighted to see it was still in print. This is a great book for a beginner or any baker.
2,Anticlimactic.,"(Warning: Contains spoilers..) After reading ""The Kindly Ones"", I was very excited to find out how The Sandman series would end. The first three issues contained in this volume introduce the new Dream, while many characters pay their respects to the previous version we had (sort of) gotten to know over the years. The first half was very promising & I looked forward to the rest. My problem, which explains the low rating, is that the final three issues completely break away from the previous storyline to deliver three self-contained stories that completely lose the momentum. I couldn't help but feel cheated, especially since there are so many more stories about these characters (particularly The Endless) that could & should have been told. Personally, I would have been more satisfied had the story ended right as the new Dream is meeting his siblings for the first time."
5,excellent condition,It took a bit to arrive but that's usual with bulk mailing. The book arrived in excellent condition.
4,"Lacking in strong narrative cohesion, but still a must-read","Fans of the series would be remiss not to spend time with this, the final volume of Neil Gaiman's ephochal Sandman series. For starters, the artwork by Zulli, Muth and Vess is some of the best that the series has seen and the return of characters, large and small, provides a satisfying sense of finality and closure that one would expect from a flagship series as this."
2,read this,"I don't like this one because it gets a few things wrong, or so my sister Monica claims, she plays the game all the time and for her birthday I got her the Septerra Core book and she was complaining because she said it didn't tell her what she wanted to know.and because of that, I give it 2 out of 5 stars..."
2,No DVD Case,"The Video is fine and shipping time was good, but the product presentation was poor. The DVD came in a round, clear plastic pocket (not a regular DVD case), so storage with other DVDs is very difficult. If the product was cheaper because of this problem and the problem was discussed on the product page, perhaps I would have been happier."
4,A good beginners book for translating japanese to english,"This book is excellent for the beginner who only wants to translate japanese to english, as it is ONLY japanese-english. It does not contain especially many words, only 3000, but it covers the most usual phrases and words. One thing that is REALLY good is that the book is full of examples, sometimes 10-15 different for a word. All examples are written in romaji and KANA/KANJI. It also states the type of verb (I,II,III) which I personally find really useful. In the end of the book there is also a 30+ page introduction of japanese grammar, which is good. It is fun to read, due to the examples, and I use it together with my other dictionary which also has an english-japanese part. I find all words (almost) in that one, but I learn more from this."
4,Just what we needed,Needed this dictionary for my son's Japanese class. It is easy to use and is a great reference tool for him. I'm happy to have saved a few dollars by purchasing it on Amazon.com
3,Not bad. Not the best.,"I purchased this book for my daughter a while ago and she was not in love with it. She complained about a lack of words, however, she did enjoy some of the book's other features (including Japanese language history, grammar, and conjugation rules). It seems to be a good book for beginners, although, possibly not the best."
5,Top of the line,I own 3 Koplin Gun Boot IV Transport units this unit makes 4 --- IMHO there are only lesser units out there including the lined boots that Koplin markets.
1,Did Scott hire a 2nd rate ghost writer?,This book falls well below the caliber of writing we have come to know from this author. I simply couldn't identify with any of the characters because they have no depth or personality. Words on a page do not add up to a great story.
1,Why bother.....,"I had to force myself to continue reading this book. I'm glad I didn't purchase this one. Boring, boring, boring. No drama, no suspense, not even interesting characters. Hope Turow has a day job."
2,Boring,"A boring novel that reads like a poorly-written textbook. I tossed it aside half way through with no intention to pick it up again. Unfortunatley, the author has not been able to live up to his first two books."
2,I had to work too hard for every page. Turow WAS.,"Well, if you like to plod, plod plod and get nowhere, this is a good book. I spent almost a week on it and really wanted to just give up many times. Unfortunately for me--I can't do that. So, I read to the end. Every now and then there would be mention of one of the other Kindle County personages (Sandy Stern, for example) and I would delude myself into thinking it was going to get better!! YUK"
2,Don't Waste Your Time And Money On This Book!,"Embedded within Personal Injuries is what could have been an interesting plot. HOWEVER, Turow feels it necessary to describe in excrutiating detail every thought, every feeling, every rationale for these thoughts and feelings of every major and minor character in this book. As a consequence, I feel that I, personally, have suffered a personal injury trying to force myself to read Turow's latest effort. Finally, after making myself read about 1/3 of the book, my disgust with Personal Injuries won out and I gave up on it. It's possible that people who read books mainly for in-depth characterizations versus plot will enjoy this book. But,for me, the following saying was the basis for my decision to not waste any more time reading this book, 'so many books, so liitle time.'"
2,Are we supposed to CARE about any of these characters???,"I really didn't like anything about this book. I was a journalism major in college and I found the long, tedious descriptions in this book to overwhelm what little plot there was. That sort of thing should supplement a plot, not replace it. I kept waiting for an unexpected plot twist, but there were not. I'm also a third-year law student, and I wasn't the least bit impressed by the legal aspect of the book either. The judges are bad, the prosecutor's bad, the lawyers are bad. I couldn't stand the main character, or really any of the characters for that matter, so in that sense Turow fails as well."
3,Tedious to read,"Took me several days to read this book. It was not a horrid book just that the action unfolded too slowly for me. There was quite a bit of detail on FBI tactics and ALS to give the book a realtistic setting. Robbie and Evon were interesting characters. Robbie knows himself well. He knows he is a deceiver and scumbag and that his only good features are his loyalty to his childhood friend and his attentiveness to his sick wife. Evon on the other hand does not know herself and is having a major identity problem throughout most of the story. However, by the end of the story she seems to be comfortable with her true self and with her sexuality."
1,"Slow paced, couldn't finish it","I was looking forward to this book and have read all of Turow's previous novels. What a let down! I can name on one hand the number of books I have not finished reading and Personal Injuries has now become one of them. In addition to the uninteresting characters and Turow's odd switches from 1st to 3rd person, I found it difficult to follow the story line when he refered to his characters by their full name, then first name and finally, their last name. I sometimes thought he was referring to three different people. Very confusing! Glad I checked it out at the library and did not purchase it."
5,A fun read by Turow.,A tremendous force by Turow this proves that this guy is better than Grisham. The Characters are interesting! Plenty of plot twists. A true tour-de-force. I had no idea that this book had this ending. It blew my mind.
1,"I wanted the book to be good, but it was only slow, boring.","I really have enjoyed Turow's books, but this one is so slow and boring. I finished the read, though it took a great effort."
1,Very difficult to read; can't get into this book.,I've read 50 pages and still can't get with the book. The character Robbie Feaver and the narrator have no appeal. I believe the book will sell based on Turow's past efforts. I am happy to say that I did not pay for the book but used my local library.
1,a major let-down versus his earlier works,"i have generally stayed up all night to finish a just-released scott turow novel. this time, he put me to sleep four nights in a row! the story never seemed to get out of low gear -- dull and unexciting are the words that come to mind. i finally gave up at the half-way mark. don't bother with this one."
2,Check the book out of your library and save your money!,"Wishing and hoping could not make this book better. Less than halfway I sat down and made note as to what the end would be. I was only wrong in my first thought on ""Evon"". Turow does spend too much time building characters at the expense of the plot. I used to be a huge Turow and Grisham fan. Now I will take my business elsewhere."
2,The jury is in; the book is a liability.,"Expecting the best out of Turow, I was disappointed with this lastest outing. He has set such a high standard, that this book does not come close. The plot is contrived and did not hold my interest. The characters in the book do not have the intensity of previous Turow plots. The book seemed to string along a set of disjoint events and it certainly did not have a killer ending. I have read more thrilling material in the newspaper. I recommend that you do not take this case and pass on to the next thriller."
2,Better than Halcyon,"I have read all of Turow's books, and know that it takes time to get into the rhythm of his distinctive prose. But I never connected with Personal Injuries. I never failed to fall asleep after reading six or seven pages, no matter the time of day. I was persistent, however, and read it to the end. Now what am I going to do to help me fall asleep? Perhaps some Pushkin?"
2,Slow read,"I am still fighting page by page to finish Turow's latest. While his character development is interesting and the story line had a chance to be a real page turner, I keep getting lost. It is not that it twists and turns to keep the reader's interest it just rambles. I think I'll not finish this one and wait a long time before I try another dose of Turow."
1,Personal Sleep Coach,"This book is just awful. The characters are underdeveloped. Evon and Robbie have NO CHEMISTRY at all. Sexual chemistry? What are you talking about?I was only half way through this book and I want to throw it out. After just a chapter, I'm falling asleep again. But I was determined to finish this book as awful as it was.This book was a waste of money. The plot was unoriginal and dull. Robbie dies in the end, big freaking deal, you are glad he dies, he was as dull as Evon and the rest of the castHORRIBLE BOOK, DO NOT BUY unless u want to use the book as a firelog, that I recommend."
1,Turow's Worst,"I've enjoyed Scott Turow's fiction. He's more literate, thoughtful, and thought-provoking than John Grisham and the rest of the pack. But this effort was awful -- I gave up about a quarter of the way through; the plot failed to grab me and, more important, life's too short to waste time with these unpleasant and uninteresting characters. I listened to the audio version, and I agree completely with the comment below about Ken Howard's poor job as a reader. I doubt that I would have gone much farther with a different reader, but Howard's dreary and uninspired style sent me straight to the exit. Giving up on this very disappointing novel made me feel that I'd stopped hitting my head against a wall."
2,Audio version became confusing,"CD/abridged: It was okay. The narrator is in first person, but he relates conversations and events that he was not witness to. It's a strange way of writing. I'm not really recommending the audio, even though Joe Mantegna did a wonderful job of narration. There were a lot of characters between the FBI agents and so-to-be indite-es. I did have to rewind and go back to earlier discs to double-check names and characters. If you're going to read it try the book version instead."
4,"great writing, characters, and plot weaker on plot turns","This is a terrific character study with a strong, captivating plot. It is also thought provoking in terms of the prosecutorial amorality of the criminal justice system. My only disappointment was that it did not have the plot twists and shocks that are found in typical mysteries or other legal thrillers --including several of Mr. Turow's other works."
1,Even the author wasn't interested in this one,"I have read and enjoyed Turow's other books, but I gave up on this one half way through. The narrative is confusing, the characters are unidimensional, and the plot is boring!"
4,What a wonderful read,"It is amazing how many people missed the boat on this one. The very first review says it all. ""Personal Injuries"" isn't about plot or story line or fast pace or excitement or courtroom drama.As I read the book I kept waiting for something to happen until I realized that something was happening. I was watching an author create a cast of characters who peopled any room I read this book in. Exquisitely drawn and beautifully built as seen through the eyes of not the first person narrator but the main character Robbie Feaver (pronounced ""favor"" as he tells us).Further, Turow's portrayal of ALS and its effect on family members as well as the victim is heartbreaking. Such sadness!Turow also leads us into the dark world of witness protection, the FBI and the battle of jurisdiction, political ambition and political medelling, etc.Well done, Mr. Turow. Some of us understood where you were going and what you were doing."
4,A fascinating character study and procedural-style novel,"Turow's latest is a superb character study that hooked me a lot more than his last book (Laws of Our Fathers). The characters of Feaver, Evon and Stan Sennett were fascinating to follow in their twists, turns and moral and legal dilemmas. Turow suffers with some critics because his books are perceived as ""genre"" fiction rather than the serious, mainstream novels of contemporary life they're clearly intended to be. Similarly, some readers seem to expect John Grisham-style thrillers. Best advice: read Turow if you enjoy serious contemporary fiction. This new one is an outstanding read and consideration of law and private moral codes."
2,The Insomniac's Best Friend,"I was very disappointed in this latest from Scott Turow. It started off slow and continued on just as slowly. I couldn't drum up the slightest bit of sympathy for the characters. And worst of all, it was predictable and took waaaaay too much time to slog through. The only way I got to the end was the promise of another book to wash away the taste of this one."
5,phenomenal,"I may be biased since I'm a personal injury lawyer.But as one, I can say that the book hit home.I'm sure others like me,know a Robbie Feaver in some way. Turow is a great story teller.His best since Presumed Innocent."
1,A major disappointment,This novel was a major letdown. Kept waiting for something to happen. Too many names to keep track of - never really cared about any of the characters. Forced myself to finish reading this one. No longer a Scott Turow fan.
2,Tedious,This topic of corruption among judges should have been gripping. Unfortunately the story line gets terribly tangled in the lives of some characters who are not very interesting or appealling.
2,The Truth Outs,"Finally someone in a position to know writes a semi-plausible scenario explaining why, at times, there is no justice in the justice system.The book does not rise to the occasion completely, as much of the plot is implausible in the real world of legal practice. The best parts of the book are found in the situations where it is not clear whether the judges are taking bribes or if the bribing attorney just thinks they are. This is razor's edge drama until Turrow allows the scales to tilt anticlimactically. A bit lazy, like the plot that a personal injury attorney can rake in the dough for a decade without a jealous insurance defense attorney picking up the phone to discover that the rich PI attorney doesn't even have a law license.Come on, Turrow. Let truth power your fiction. And sneak in a tale or two about the camaraderie of judges and insurance defense attorneys . . ."
3,Personal Injuries,"While it is an interesting read, I found the surprise ending and the wrapping up of the characters' lives at the conclusion to be depressing and ultimately unsatisfying. In addition, I think that the hidden truth about Robbie Feaver's longtime practice of law without a license is a totally unrealistic fictional device. No lawyer can survive without a valid attorney ID number. For me, that particular gimmick invalidates the narrator's description of the work as a ""lawyer's story."" Considering all the time and effort Turow put into this project, and his obvious talent, I am sorry he couldn't have thought up a more believable plot twist."
2,One of Turow's weaker efforts,The book never accelerated into high gear. It took me over a week to read which never happened with any of his prior books. It seemed he spent more time describing scenes in excrutiating detail than telling a story.
5,"Highly textured, literate and ""true""","This is a book that will definitely turn off folks who rely on the ""Jurassic Park"" legal world of John Grisham and his imitators. Instead, what Turow does is combine obvious first hand knowledge with a strong writing style and an overlay of great inside stories incorporated in a strong narrative context. Complaints that the book is boring probably eminate from the fact that it moves carefully and probes beneath the surface of its characters. It is much more literary than much of what passes for legal fiction these days."
1,Second unfinished Turow book,"This is the second book of his that I haven't finished. I only got halfway through his last book before I gave up. This one I got about 3/4 through before saying to myself ""Enough already"". I agree with one person who said Turow's habit of using charters first, then last, then full name to be very confusing. I kept waiting for something to happen and it never did as far as I was concerned. I have given up on this author. I refuse to buy anymore of his books."
1,Personal Injuries,I gave up. I read 97 pages and have found nothing to m ake me want to read any further. I don't know how someone could write Presumed Innocent and write something this bad. I kept tninking something would make me want to finish it. No such luck.
2,In a word - boring,"Although Mr Turow is without doubt a skillful writer, the book droned on without creating any kind of sympathy for the characters. I ended up hating the whole crew. A waste of time. Stick to Colin Dexter ' Inspector Morse' or someone like Dennis Lehane, at least he keeps the plot moving and doesn't drone us into a coma. Not recommended, at all."
2,Disappointed,"I have been a fan of Turow's for some time, but I was disappointed by ""Personal Injuries"". Like so many writers who become successful, he has abandoned the style that made him famous for a more ""artsy"" approach. He has thrown out tightly written dialog and replaced it with long narratives that add little to the story. He has created characters that no one can really care about. Turow should get back to basics!"
2,Disappointed,"I found this to be a huge disappointment, as I had read other Scott Turow novels, and I looked forward to this one. In my opinion, the plot line wandered and was boring. Definitely not up to his usual fast-moving tales."
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring",I love mystery thrillers. This is not a mystery or a thriller. I am half way through the book only because I paid full price but have decided to cut my losses. This is my first and last Turow read.
2,A Literary Injury,I have enjoyed several Turow works but was disappointed with Personal Injuries. The voicing awkward and the story plodding. Avoid this work in favor of his others.
2,No hook to care,"I listened to this book on tape. The book is forgetable. The bad guy turned 'mole' because of wife's deadly illness felt like an contrived 8th grade plot. The story is narrated through the bad guy's lawyer but is confusing since the lawyer is such a minor, minor character. The story is mostly 3rd person narrative based on the lawyer's ideas of what happened."
4,Great Character Novel,This is a treat. Characters who are multi - dimensional. Personal Injuries is a delicious character study. It is a study in humanity and how one's actions take on a life of their own. I recommend this to lovers of quality fiction writing.
5,An interesting and provoking read,Turows books are adventures in humanism. A finer contemporary author I have not found.My idea of brain food.
3,Turow continues his slow descent,"I have been a fan of Turow's since One L. As far as his novels are concerned, however, there has been a steady declination in there quality since his first novel - Presumed Innocent, which was an excellent read. Nevertheless, I still enjoy his work and will continue to buy his books."
3,"Good story, slow confusing start","I really had a hard time with the start of this book. I was very confused and was really starting to wonder what was going on. I really picked up speed though about 150 pages into it. After I finished, I thought back and decided I really enjoyed it. Not nearly as good as previous works, but agree with other reviewers it is time to move to another county!"
2,Not his best book,"I have read Turow's other works and they are much better than this book. The first 200 pages of Personal Injuries is a real snoozer. The rest of the book picks up some, but not enough to make up for the slow start."
4,Another excellent Turow book with minor problems,"Personal Injuries was an excellent book that had one major flaw--too many characters! The plot was well developed, clever and very interesting to discover layer upon layer of deception. The main characters were unique and watching them evolve was good reading. The descriptions of a person with ALS were stunning and heartwrenching and speak to the excellence of Turow's writing and compassion. But with so many charcters to keep track of the narrative line almost became lost and by the end my brain was tired trying to keep everyone straight. I look forward to his next book."
2,Slow...very slow....,"I love legal novels. This one started out great, but after half the book, and never moving the story along, I gave up. A big disappointment. Author is usually better than this effort."
4,An Excellent Read,"This is a credible story, if a little intense. Some of the legal technicalities were difficult to understand, particularly Robbie's partner's role in the entire deception, but, generally, the characters well well-drawn and the story was well balanced where most of the characters did get some sort of justice. In particular, the picture of Robbie's wife, his love for her, and her suffering, gave a depth to this read which is usually missing from the genre. This is a page turner, and a good one."
1,Why is this a bestseller?,"The characters were somewhat interesting, but the plot was duuuullll. There were no surprises and it seemed to plod on forever. Don't waste your money."
3,Corruption in Law!,"Interesting,difficult style,disturbing topic and an insiders view of our Courts? Should be mandatory reading for Law Students,Lawyers,and certainly Judges. As for the rest of us,great food for thought,but not as enjoyable as previously enjoyable Torows'"
1,Slow-moving and boring,"I purchased this book to read on a long airplane flight to help the time go faster. My advice to others who may want to do the same: DON'T! This book dragged on with dull stereotypic characters that had DULL conversations. This book almost made the airline magazine articles interesting! My advice; soooooo many books, so little time, skip this one."
2,Nice try . . . but,"Started out slow and from there, went nowhere. It lacked the suspence of a Grisham novel. After finishing the book you're left with the same empty feeling you had at the beginning. However, Robbie Feaver is a very likable character. It's a shame he's not around to star in a more well-written novel!"
3,I Don't Believe It,"While this book does a great job of brining certain characters to life, specifically Robbie Feaver and Evon Miller, I found a great deal of the key plot elements to be completely unbelievable. Unfortunately, I can't say too much without giving too much away.I also found it a little disconcerting that the novel was narrarated in the first person, but did very little to develop the character of the first person narrarator."
1,Yawn,"Really, really boring. A novel about lawyers talking to lawyers about bribing a judge. No suspense, no character development, no story. I've liked everything Turow has written, up until this. What would motivate Turow to produce something like this?"
1,Personal Sleep Coach,"This book is just awful. The characters are underdeveloped. Evon and Robbie have NO CHEMISTRY at all. Sexual chemistry? What are you talking about?I'm only half way through this book and I want to throw it out. After just a chapter, I'm falling asleep again. But I'm determined to finish this book as awful as it may be. I'm still hoping it will pick up the pace soon....... but that outlook seems dismal.HORRIBLE BOOK"
1,I won't make this mistake again.,"I thoroughly enjoyed Presumed Innocent and Burden of Proof. The remainder of Mr. Turow's previous books seemed to be of lesser quality. I had made the decision not to read Personal Injuries, but after reading the professional reviews, I decided that I would give it a try. What a mistake! The book is very slow getting off the ground. When I finally think he is making progress with the story, Mr. Turow develops a situation where the characters go off in all directions again and the storyline is lost - one more time. It is good to get some of the history of the characters to be able to watch them develop, but this book does more than necessary and gets sidetracked from the storyline very often. I found myself frequently saying, ""Who cares!"" I should have stayed with my original course of action and not purchased the book. I will not make this mistake again."
1,Shallow Effort Borders on Tedious,"The characters, the story and the outcome solicit only a big, ""So what!"" When all was said and done I cared little for these characters and the beds they had each made for themselves to lie in."
3,Fun book,"I like this book. Not great, but good beach reading. The ending is a little tacky, but the character development is top notch."
2,In Search of More Poetic Prose in a Thriller.,"I am an author and I love thrillers. My biggest disappointment in today's world of adventure fiction is the inability to find a mesmerizing adventure constructed with poetic and living prose which allows me to feel the southern Louisiana heat, smell the toasted bagels in a Manhattan deli or wince along with the facial expressions of a lawyer caught ambulance chasing in the hospital room of a critically injured patient. While a better yarner than Turow, Grisham's works lack the sort of living color which fiction demands. I recently discovered an author who accomplishes this and a thriller in which he does it. The author is Gary Wickert, and the book is DARK REDEMPTION. If you like Grisham's storylines, but want to be riveted to and made love to by the prose which are the building blocks of any piece of fiction....READ 'DARK REDEMPTION'."
1,Pretty lame,"I ordered Personal Injuries, The Triumph and the Glory, and Cold Mountain a couple weeks ago. At least The Triumph and the Glory was good. Turow just went through the motions with this book. Sorry, but I was personally injured by this flawed patchwork job of a novel."
5,book to read - not skim,"This is a great book, but you have to take the time to actuallyREAD it. The characters are fleshed out and work together very well inthe story. Skimming won't work. Sit down, sit back, and enjoy."
1,Turow this one back!,"Reading Scott Turow is like going to Law School; it's in Chicago and it sucks. Another pound or two of legalese from this master market grabber. True fans of legal fiction should enjoy this, but people are better off watching Matlock on PAX-TV. Turow's main problem is his attention to detail; everybody knows an olive fork doesn't twist like that, why draw our attention to the flaw by high-lighting it in detail? He could have just said ""fork."" I can't believe I put down Louis Ferdinand Celine for this. I am so sad and it is Scott Turow's fault."
2,Fails to exercise its strength and becomes tedious,"Turow has legal knowledge, and when he chooses to write about it, explains in clear English why the law operates as it does. That part of this book is interesting. He's almost onto something with his lead character Feaver, except that the guy is not endearing or interesting in any way, being a scam artist like many other tedious characters we encounter in life. It develops well at first, but then falls into a plodding pace, with a predictable ending. Sentiment and comedy fill in the gaps but let the wind of emptiness through. I would not recommend this book."
3,"3.5, Sometimes the good guys look like the bad guys.....","Normally I wouldn't review genre fiction such as this, but I thought Turow did an exceptional job of layering his plot and characters.This is the kind of novel where quick value judgments seem appropriate, only later to realize the prudence of reserving judgment.There is a contrast in this story of good vs. evil, but with the caveat that ""fighting evil....often comes to evil"". A successful Personal Injury attorney is brought down by the successful machinations of the FBI, in an attempt at massive indictments of corrupt jurists. There is no question who the bad guys are. What becomes a study in the vagaries of human nature is the extreme measures undertaken by government agencies to achieve their goals. Priorities and values shift in deceptive degrees, until it seems that all have lost pieces of their souls or found pieces of their hearts."
2,Pretty Much A Waste Of Time,"Author Scott Turow wrote one of the best books I have ever read titled, ""Presumed Innocent."" This book - ""Personal Injuries"" is one of the worst I've read. I believe the author has superlative writing skills but there is no character in this book that a reader can admire, or identify with, or root for. The plot is like a bad dream wherein the same stupid things keep happening or almost happening over and over. This book and his previous book, ""The Laws Of Our Fathers"" are a depressing waste of a great talent. I keep hoping that Turow will find a good ""leading man"" for a decent plot (someone we would enjoy spending time with) - and I am sadly disappointed that he does not. Also - this book could have eliminated one-third of its verbiage and it would be a slightly better read. What annoys me is the list of effusive reviews that appear in the first pages of the paperback edition. Where in hell do they get reviewers that praise this dreck?"
4,Not the usual stuff,"Very rarely do we find a legal thriller that has any substance, and we finally find one here and many readers pan it. I guess you are just too used to the usual drivel that that is foisted upon us. This book is nicely written and you get some nice deep characters. You people who panned this book are reason that so many authors of this genre write books just for the slight hope that Hollywood will make it a movie. The good guy has some rough times in the book, maybe a nice guy gets sadly killed, but Hooray for Hollywood, the good guys win. We get a very nice book and all you want is a whodunit. Sorry, but I think its sad. Bravo for you Scott Turow."
4,Turow at his best,"I liked Personal Injuries A LOT. Turow is always an interesting writer. But after putting down The Laws of Our Father unfinished, I thought I had had my fill of him. What captivated me about Personal Injuries was, one, a Clinton-esque main character Robbie Feaver, and an intriguing plot line. I cared about what happened to Feaver, I bled for his wife Rainey at the end stage of Lou Gehrig's disease, and hoped the undercover agent Evon would become more fully alive. Turow's perspective that ethical dilemmas are rarely black and white appealed to me in the post-impeachment era. This is a moving, life affirmative novel that paints a realistic picture of how law is practiced in the scrappy, workaday world. Bravo, Turow!"
1,A Turow I couldn't finish--I'd never have believed it,"The Law of Our Fathers left me waiting impatiently for his next book. What a great disappointment. The heart seems to have gone out of his writing. What happened? And please, please tell me why the book wasn't written from Evon's point of view. I didn't know George. I didn't care about George. Evon was present at the action but somehow she remained mute. I hope that Scott Turow, the lawyer who writes who can actually write, will please his fans next time and not just his bank and his publishers.I found that the people who gushed about this book had never read Turow before. Now that his face is on t.v. and he's an instant best selling author will the quality continue to diminish? I sure hope not. I'll still be waiting for the next one, but not with much excitement."
2,Mr. Turow needs to re-energize!,"As a fan of Turow, I was not displeased until mid-way through when this book just stopped dead. The concept and characters had a strong start, but turned into a dull, sometimes confusing lecture. I really thought of stopping but forced myself to finish. The ending was OK, but too much effort to get there."
1,A 400-Page Newspaper Article,"I've read Scott Turow's earlier novels, which I greatly enjoyed! Unfortunately, Personal Injuries was a big disappointment. I kept plodding through it wondering when it would pick up... it never did. It was like reading a 400-page newspaper article!"
2,Personally Bored,"A very slow, tedious, and shallow story. Very disappointing. Makes you wonder if he wrote this to be instantly sold as a screenplay. I lost interest in the story several times because I didn't really feel I got to know or care about the characters, and I only went back to the book because I was determined to finish it. Very contrived ending. Glad to be finished. The book doesn't display the skills he used in Presumed Innocent, his best attempt to date."
2,personal injuries,"an overhyped, overdrawn, and ultimately ponderous read. what little plot there is is drawn out and repeated ad naseum. Fevors is a worthy and complex character but the handwriting eats away the wall and we know what's coming all the way. The judges are like furniture wheeled out and put away while our anti-hero flirts endlessly with FBI agent Even, closet lesbian, olympic athlete who is totally opaque and uninteresting. What more can I say, except a disappointing yawner."
3,Robbie Feaver - One in a million,"I just finished this intriguing character study of a personal injury lawyer whose tactics are antithetical to the sensibilities of most ordinary people, but whose charm always saves him in the end. If you have ever known a ""Robbie Feaver,"" you would be as sympathetic to the person as I am, while viewing his ""deeds"" as the outrageous and heinous actions they are.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and look forward to reading his others."
3,"Fascinating, compelling and tedious","Turow is an excellent writer. He has written some of the best crime fiction on the last several years. This isn't one of them. Given the secondary focus of this book, the devastating disease ALS, it's too bad.Robbie Feaver is a top personal injury attorney. For years he's been in league with the devil, fixing cases womanizing, and making tons of money. Now the Fed comes to call and he has to rat on his colleagues all the while trying to cope with his wife's ALS, which no amount of money can cure.Turow has written a bitter, cynical novel. His skills as a writer are topnotch and his illumination of ALS is highly useful. But the novel, compelling as it is, is way too long and has few likeable characters."
2,Needs a good editor,"While starting slowly, this novel gradually builds interest. While I found the narrators voice to be difficult to follow, I grew more and more interested in the interaction between Feaver and the female FBI agent. And then...the novel just drags and drags, becoming more and more confusing. There were several times when I wasn't even sure the narrator hadn't been changed. Case after phony case, judge after judge are dragged into the plot, creating a huge cry for sharp editing. Then, as the novel moves to its denouement, Turow seems to give up and throws in a most unsatisfying and, quite honestly, unbelievable ending. It's like he just gave up, not wanting to bother with fulfilling the lives of Feaver and Evon. Not recommended."
1,Disappointing,I was two thirds through the book and still waiting for it to get interesting. I was quite disappointed as I am a Turow fan and have very much enjoyed his previous works.
2,This book is a disappointment for fans of Turow.,"""Personal Injuries"" fails on many counts. The characters are not compelling. The plot drags interminably. Turow makes the unfortunate choice of writing the novel in the first person (a lawyer narrates) and then switching to the third person throughout much of the book. This device is awkward and it weakens the narrative greatly. Another problem is that the book has no clear focus. It veers between the pathetic plight of a woman dying of ALS, her loser husband who must participate in a sting to nab corrupt judges, and a female FBI agent who is exploring her identity. The book lacks warmth, humor, suspense and frankly, it is not worth the reader's time."
1,Wake me up when its over,"I thought that this might be a pretty good book, but I was wrong! I kept trying to continue reading further, but decided that it would be an exercise in masochisim to do so. It was simply boring, rambling on and on about nothing - boring characters and dull material. As well, the narration style was very awkward. At any rate, I am thankful that it was only a library book, because I wouldn't have been impressed had I paid money for it."
4,Mankinds darkest hours,"I got this to update my historical knowledge about the holocaust.Almost everyone have heard of Auschwitz, but these death camps and what happened is not so well known.You will find information from many perspectives in this book. From the men who organized and ran these camps, how the the transportation was organized; to those who stayed there and survived.It is a very strong book, and I had to read it in two parts. Taking it all in at once was just to much.It feels strange to give a ""i like it review"", since the information in the book is so disturbing."
5,Funny as all Hell,"This book does not hold a candle to the movie. The book is funny throughout. The people in the book seem more real and at times relate to them more. You can also grab onto some person or another and say ""yeah"" that was me in high school. Crowe really did do his homework on when it came to this book. He adds wit, humor and tender monemts that are not sappy yet tender in a way. I would say go out and get this book because the moive is like the cliff notes of the movie and if you really wanna laugh then you need to read this."
4,Better Than the Movie,"I bet you didn't even know this was a book before it was a movie, did you? The first thing to know is that the book is much better than the movie. The definitive novel about early 80s Southern California high-school life, it is actually based on real events, as its subtitle ""A True Story"" tells you. Cameron Crowe apparently actually attended high-school for a year to do a ""portrait"" of contemporary high-school life. Fast Times is what emerged. While fairly faithful to the story, the movie diminishes the roles of Mark ""the Rat"" and Brad, and pumps up the role of Spicoli (who is a freshman in the book). It's a quick read, and well worth it if you want a light-hearted period book. It can be a little hard to find though."
4,Nina Hagen in Ekstase,"This was one of my favorites in the mid 80's. I have long since retired my turn-table so when I saw this CD available for right around $10, I was 'in ekstase'. I was disappointed that it was the German version and not the English. My fault entirely. I'd seen this CD for upwards of $40-50 so I snapped it up without reading the details. I've nothing against the German language but I wanted to relive a specific time, track after track. But having said that and listening to it a few times I've grown to like it more and more. Nina is an amazing artist in any language so German, English, Bindi, Urdu, Ninaease, whatever, I'm good. 'In Ekstase' in any language embodies Nina at her most self."
3,No one is like Nina!,"Totally unique and very fun. German punk. Bizarre, wild, funky, one-of-a-kind. Saw Nina live - amazing woman."
3,soemwhat flat knightly novel,a somewhat flat novel from steinbeck---not accustomed to this subject matter from steinbeck--i anticipated subject matter similar to his other novels so i was somewhat disappointed here.
3,An Interesting Might-Have-Been,"You can watch Steinbeck start to tackle the project that has seduced so many writers-- why not take Mallory's massive Arthurian cycle and turn it into something accessible to a modern reader? At first, Steinbeck merely dips his feet in the waters. The first ""chapters"" are nearly-exact ""translations"" of Mallory into modern English, with very little added or taken away. Then, slowlby but surely, Steinbeck's voice begins to emerge and he begins to not just translate but retell the tales. Steinbeck grows into the task, telling the stories with greater and great power, conviction, energy, excitement and style and then-- well, then it just stops. For students of Mallory or Steinbeck, this is an interesting work, a unique collaboration 500 years in the making. If you're looking for a good version of the Matter of Britain, however, this will disappoint in its incompleteness."
4,Steinbeck's Take on Classic Tales,"John Steinbeck tackles Malory's ""Morte d'Arthur"" in modern prose here. The tales are made somewhat more linear and easy to understand, but it still helps to have a grounding in the original pieces. Many presumptions are made by the author, the most basic of which is that the reader already knows certain things about the characters. One of the minor but noteworthy things about this book is the dedication; Steinbeck dedicates the novel to his sister, whom he avers would have been a splendid knight. Read Malory first, then pick up this volume."
4,Storybook favorites,"You'll enjoy these, particularly Gulliver's Travels. Hanna Barbera made a number of these 45 min features throughout the 1970s."
5,Helpful,"My daughter is slightly overweight. This book was helpful and encouraging. We already eat healthy in my home so I know about healthy eating. I also know about obesity facts, but the rest of the info was useful. I would say this book is good for overweight or obese children from the age of four through the teen years."
3,Not bad but,The pads perform great and are just as the ad explained them to be. Pictures on amazon sometimes are different than what you get from the actual product because the pads I purchased had a black logo on them and the picture shows them as plain white.
5,The Best Romance . . . the Best Sex,"Ya'll betta take notice. This book is off the chain! I can't begin to explain how good this book is. I'm gonna have to write another review later after I read it again. Can Sheba Mathis, with her champagne tastes and caviar dreams, find true love with the lowly Sol Domingo, a mall security guard, who is not exactly what he seems? (Hint, hint . . . He gets chauffered around once in a while in a Bently and he owns a yacht.) The romance and wacky plot twists of COMING TO AMERICA meet the wild and lusty sex of Zane's ADDICTED in this modern, urban fairytale. I love this book. Keep up the good work, Preston. Nobody writes about knockin' da boots like you. You turn out great book after great book. You're the best. Keep at it. One day Simon and Schuster will notice. You're too good to be doing this on your own. Love, Amelinda."
5,WHEW STEAMY....,"FOR BEGINERS THIS IS MY ENGLISH PROFESSOR AND UNTILL TODAY I ONLY KNEW HIM AS PROFESSOR ALLEN PRESTON, NOW I KNOW HIM AS THE WRITER ALLEN PRESTON AND MAY I SAY DAMN, COME WITH ME SHEBA IS DEFINATELY WORTH THE READ, ITS STEAMY AND INTRIGUING, I LIKE HOW SOL KEEPS GETTING FIRED AND HIRED AND KIND OFF LEAVES SHEBA THINKING HOW PERSISTANT HE IS. WELL I BEGAN TO READ THE FIRST CHAPTER AT WORK BUT WAS UNABLE TO CONTINUE. I CAN NOT WAIT TILL IM ABLE TO GET TO THE REST OF IT. IF THE FIRST CHAPTER WAS THAT GOOD I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT THE REST WILL BE LIKE. I ALSO LIKED HOW DESCRIPTIVE AND MODERN IT WAS AND THE FACT THAT IT WAS ALL HAPENING IN MIAMI MADE IT EVEN BETTER. IM TRULY SPEECHLESS GREAT JOB PROFESSOR ILL WRITE ANOTHER REVIEW AS SOON AS IM DONE WITH THE BOOK!"
1,You get what you pay for,"This slicer seemed like a bargain at $100. It looks like it's all steel and the sales pitch hypes the abundance of metal on this device. However, it has plenty of plastic and seems somewhat flimsy. Also, the motor feels totally week. Slicing hard bread seems to strain the motor. It seems to me that this slicer may have a place for you but any hard slicing jobs just seem too much. Also, there was a little plastic knob to turn in case you wanted to remove the blade. Our knob either came broken or broke when we tried to turn it. Basically, unless you are buying professional grade you get alot of plastic and a week motor. There are no detours. I almost wonder if my dads hand slicer would work better than these electric slicer. Oh how I long for the days when things were built to last. But hey we all like the thrill of buying new junk and China obliges."
2,Not good for slicing bacon,"I ordered this because I hoped it would be good for slicing fresh cured bacon or side pork, but alas it is not. As others have said it leaves a trailing edge of meat that has to be cut off. I had to cut my slab of bacon in half width wise because it was too long for the slicer to work. I had short bacon instead of the normal length kind, which was ok. I also partially froze the meat prior to slicing to help firm it up.I tried it on a loaf of wheat bread I made and it did not do a very good job of slicing it. It left the edge raggedy.I will be returning it because it does not meet my needs. I am disappointed 'cause I really wanted it to work."
2,Hard to clean.,"It does a good enough job, I suppose, but it's very difficult to clean...to the point that I don't use it much because it's such a job to clean it."
4,Decent for the money,"The picture makes it look better than it is. Keeping it sanitary will be a big concern as it packs the meat into a crack on the bottom. Some of it can be cleaned by removing parts, then there is the those other places. Someone also mentioned that it doesn't cut slices evenly, which is true. You can flip the meat over, or push slower, either helps. Overall, it is decent for the money and I would recommend or buy it again."
1,not a good value at all,"We bought this slicer in Mar 2010 for very light slicing chores. We have used it 3 times. We sliced leftover ham roast with it when we first got it and then we thin sliced a raw beef tenderloin to make steak sandwiches. Today I decided to make sandwich meat out of our leftover boneless Easter ham and started slicing it. I got about half way through and the blade stopped. Thinking it might be jammed I removed it and still the drive gear was not turning but the motor was running. I removed the two screws that hold the cover plate on and found the ""plastic"" drive gear that meshes with a metal worm gear was all chewed up. Ironically, the machine is one month out of warranty - I wonder how it knew? Anyhow, that breaks down to about $33 per slicing session which is NOT a good value at all.I would not recommend this machine to anyone considering the extremely cheap way this is made - with use it just WILL NOT last."
3,Works well,"No problem with its operation, my only complaint is the difficult and necessary cleaning after use. The manual recommends ""wiping with damp sponge"" after use. That is not adequate after slicing fatty meats. It really needs to be disassembled and cleaned, messily I might add, with soap and water. It was not designed for such cleanings."
5,"Works great, cleans up quickly----well designed and made.","My title says it all. Well designed, well made, cleans up easy and does what I need it to (slice meat for jerky)."
2,deli slicer,Not very happy with this product. I am still debating on weather or not to return it. I found it very difficult trying to remove the blade and almost broke the the plastic trying to loosen it. I finally got a butter knife and ended up scratching the plastic trying to get it off to clean. Anything I have tried to slice always seems to bunch up near the bottom of the blade. I don't feel that it slices very even either. On a positive note once the blade is removed it is easy clean up.
5,EdgeCraft Food Slicer,"This is a great, handy product. While I probably only use it once or twice a month, it really gets the job done. Clean up is a breeze."
3,A cut above?,"This slicer will be fine, once we learn and master it's idiosyncrasies. Most importantly, make sure you have a tray handy to catch the meat as it flies off the blade or it will end up on the floor. We found it helped to put a tray under just two of the feet so it sat at an angle. It was a little lighter weight than we thought it would be, but for the occasional party it will be fine. Wouldn't expect it to hold up if it was used on a daily basis. Overall, it will do the job, but not overly impressed."
4,Performs well,The slicer was a gift for my father. He really likes it and uses it frequently. His only complaint is tht it is difficult to clean.
4,Pretty good for home use,"Slices through meat well. Easy to take apart and clean. The blade/motor sound like they are moving pretty slowly, but they still cut pretty quickly. We have only used this to slice proscuitto (that's the reason we bought it - It is difficult to cut proscutto thin enough without a slicer).The pieces are heavy plastic and light metal. This is NOT one of those commercial slicers - but it does just fine for our occasional slicing needs."
4,Home deli!,"Used slicer for the first time about a week ago and was very pleased. Purchased the unit in reponse to ever increasing supermarket deli per-pound costs, with plans to use it to slice lower per-pound cost pre-cooked bulk deli meats from warehouse/resturant supply stores. The slicer did the job on 10 lbs. of turkey, 9 lbs. of ham and 5 pounds of roast beef without much effort. Lots of power for a home use unit. Size limitations required a little downsizing of the bulk meats, and slices were not quite as thin as at the supermarket, but our savings were awesome!"
5,Great time saver,We have wanted one for along time and have not been able to justify the expense for one. The cost of this was very reasonable and we are extremely pleased with it's performance. Clean up was pretty easy as well.
4,Good Value,"To temper B. Feldman's review (the first in the list); I give this a good value. It does a good job of slicing for sure but Feldman caused me disappointment. I bought this with a whole prechuto in the refrigerator to slice and everybody knows prechuto needs sliced ""paper thin"" for sure. Contrary to Feldman's review, paper thin is at best a challenge with this slicer. I ended up with ham jerky; it's the best it can do, thin wise.So if you don't need paper thin, this is the best value I found, does a great job and does clean up in a snap. I find that the fence isn't rigid enough to keep the tolerances of thinner slicing. So to be referring to it as anything like professional is over stated.Don't let this review discourage your purchase for your kitchen unless your a prechuto fan; for that reach much deeper in your pockets. I just thought Feldman really over stated the machine."
1,do not buy this,"This slicer works fine if you dont have to clean it. However the blade is attached with a plastic screw!! I read the reviews before I bought this machine and all the negative reviews mention this, so I was prepared. I made sure I did not over tighten the blade so I would not break the screw. The very first time I used it I sliced a beautiful roast no complaints, but when I went to clean the slicer up I broke the flimsy plastic screw. I knew it was fragile. I took care not to break it, but it is impossible not to break. Do not buy this machine!!!!!!"
3,from our home kitchen,"I purchased this slicer for home-based use. It actually performed a little worse than I expected after reading what other folks had to say about it. I always read the reviews before buying a product, especially when it's from online. The reason I only gave this product 3 stars was because, yes, it does slice meats, cheese, veggies.. BUT it is NOT consistent with the slices. I have used slicers on-the-job and although it will work for our needs and is small enough to store easily when not in use, it definately IS NOT comparative to a professional grade and the name of ""Premium"" is misleading. If asked if I would purchase this slicer again, the answer is, probably, but if actual professional slicers became more affordable for the average consumer, I'd opt to spend a little more and get a really good one."
4,Nice small slicer,"So far we have sliced meats and cheese on this with no problems. It is a small ""residential"" model so don't plan on throwing large briskets on it. Youtube videos of it painted perfect picture of what it really is and can do. For a regular house it is perfect for the money."
5,Real Money Savor,"We are raising three grand children, each a bottomless pit at meal times (not to mention just about anytime). Buying bulk sandwich meats and cheeses then slicing is a real money saver. Cutting as needed also helps keep things fresher. I've also slicked cooked meat, as well as slightly frozen meat before cooking, and it's performed well in all cases. It doesn't cut as thin (paper) as a deli for salami but we can live with that. Overall it's what we hoped for. We've been using our unit for 7 months (several times a week) and it's performed flawlessly."
4,meat slicer,"Works as promised, cuts very well. The only drawback is the cleaning of the machine after use. It takes awhile to get it all apart and cleaned and back together again."
5,Very nice slicer!,"Not big enough for commercial use but would highly recommend it for a home-owner. Very practical slicer. So far we've sliced bologna, cheese, and pig scrapple. Easy to take apart and clean. Small and compact but yet mighty."
1,emaybin@comcast.net,The product was advertised to cut up to one inch thick when it arrived it clearly stated on the box that it only cut up to three quarters inch -since I purchased it to cut large rib eye or strip steak briskets into one inch steaks for outdoor grilling -I had no use for it
4,Great choice for what I want.,"For me, choosing a product becomes difficult when you have hands on experience with both the commercial and household versions of a product. I look to reviews to see if the product will fit my well defined needs.I bought this slicer to be able to make whole muscle jerky and other thinly sliced meat dishes. I generally work with raw meats and as such, the unit does the slicing and then comes apart for a thorough cleaning with relative ease.With raw meat, getting the last little piece sliced with out slicing into the tips of the plastic holder was tricky. If the mold used to make this piece was beefed up a little (no pun intended) it would not flex when pressure was applied. This is the reason I give it a 4 instead of 5."
5,Very easy to use and clean,"I like this slicer, and am satisfied with the quality and convenience. The power cord retracts, the slicing platform locks for safety, and unlocks completely for removal to clean. The blade comes on and off very easily, with a coin. There is a little tray to catch the meat as it falls. This slicer seems very adequate for home use."
4,"Good Slicer, Not too hard to clean","This is my first slicer and I got it because of the good reviews others gave.Tried it with slicing meats and vegetablesMeat:Frozen beef, lamb and porkI found out the wider the meat the harder to slice it perfectly. After slicing, the thickness of the meat slicing is not even, the end is thinner than the front. It can be sliced thin and evenly but need to pay attention for each slice which is sort of tiresome when trying to slice a 5 pound chunk.Vegetable:Carrot and Turnip(Daikan)Always got perfect slice.The clean is not too hard.Easy to take the blade and parts out for cleaning.But the lubricant on the blade is too much."
2,Great for awhile,The slicer arrived and seemed to work great. We sliced tritip for sandwiches about 5 times then kapoot it just died. I took it apart and the cheap nylon gears were worn out. I am past the 30 day return period and am not sure if i can file a warranty claim. I guess that's why it's still nice to shop at the warehouse club for certain items. When they stop working you just drop them off.
4,WORKS JUST FINE,I purchased this item for my restaurant. We have just a few charcuterie meats that need to be thinly sliced. It works just fine. The only thing I must warn about is the pressure you put on the handle. Be careful not to put too much pressure on the handle or your slices won't be thin. For the price you can't beat this slicer. I shopped around quit a bit before purchasing this. Some slicers are hundreds or thousands of dollars. I'm very happy with my purchase.
3,"Cuts good, but that plastic screw...","I works fine for a home meat slicer, my only concern is that plastic screw that holds the blade on, it feels like it is going to break everytime I twist it off for cleaning."
5,Very nice slicer especially for the price,"I received this slicer as a Christmas gift. I love it. I haven't tried slicing harder meat items such as dry salami but it works great for ham and turkey. I also use it for slicing bread, which was the main reason I wanted it. I've worked in the food industry in the past. It's certainly no Hobart slicer but I have a small kitchen and I'm not doing a lot of heavy prep work. It fits my needs perfectly.It makes slices paper thin as others have mentioned, to over 1/2 inch thick for those big bread slices. The plastic screw has been replaced with another type of plastic screw. To remove it you need a coin, which fits in the slot nicely. As long as it's not overtightened, I don't think breakage will be an issue.By being able to slice my own deli meats and breads, this slicer will pay for itself in no time.I'd recommend this product to my friends."
1,Disappointed,"Finally, I've ran into something that I did not care for.When I received the box it was semi-banged up (thanks again UPS), but that isn't my reasoning for the one star.I was expecting a little better quality from the product and just was not satisfied. Upon close inspection, I noticed that the blade was off by over 1/8 in from top to bottom. This would have created slices that were uneven. The screw that holds the blade is plastic and would most likely wear out over time (similar to the one I was replacing)Needless to say I have returned the item, Amazon made the process very easy. Tread carefully on this one!"
2,"Nice design, inadequite motor",I anxiously awaited the arrival of this slicer and the smooth blade i ordered separately so i could slice up a whole serrano ham i just received. I was just using an end piece to test this slicer and found that the blade rotation was too slow and the motor straining when bringing the meat through the cut process. It did get warm and also to its credit did not overheat. The overall design is very nice and is easy to clean but it the motor is too weak for the job and needs to run faster. I am giving two stars basically for the nice design and reasonable price. If the motor was faster and stronger five would be my selection. I will think about returning this.
5,Can't complain,"I've only had it for a week, but so far so good. I cut through a couple pounds of frozen beef (making beef jerky) with no problems."
4,EdgeCraft 610 Chef's Choice Premium Electric Food Slicer,"I purchased this item to slice chicken breast. I was concerned about the jerky tenders I was giving my dog especially when the print on the package say's ""Made in China"". So I decided to make my own Chicken Jerky. The EdgeCraft 610 was perfect for slicing chicken breast when partially thawed. It was very easy to use and the clean up was a breeze. There weren't a lot of pieces to dismantle unlike some of the other kitchen appliance I have. I reviewed other slicers and this one is by far the best in comparison and I was not disappointed when it arrived. Unfortunately I haven't had the opportunity to slice other meats, however, I do plan on purchasing whole turkey or ham loafs for slicing instead of buying the already sliced lunch meat you get in a package."
2,cheap plastic parts,"I loved this slicer when we got it. It slices great. Cleaning not easy. Blade removal for cleaning, damn near impossible. It amazes me that a machine made mostly out of metal uses plastic parts for the only parts that require maintenance. Simply put the blade was always hard to remove and the plastic knob for removing it was flimsy. Ended up breaking the plastic female threaded gear that the blade attached to simply trying to remove the blade and clean it. So close, yet so far from being a great product."
2,not what i expected,"this slicer will not shave or anything close to it, you have to push real hard aginst the fence to get it to slice thin, and keep turning the think you are trying to slice, not the best, a pain to clean, and a very large itrm to store in a small kitchen, i guess you get what you pay for."
3,I don't think it is easy to clean.,"Also, maybe its the first time use the e-slicer. I do not satisfy with what it can do. The meal has to be prepared before the cut and somehow the sliced piece jam-ed in the bottom.I return it cause I smelled some thing like something burned inside. Anyway, I would not buy any e-slicer anymore for sure."
1,good purchase,"This item was a gift for our son, and he said it worked very well, and was easy to clean. Our only complaint was that it was promised for next day delivery, and we paid a considerable additional fee for this, but the item did not arrive until several days later. Amazon immediately refunded the additional shipping cost, but the item still was not there for the party when it was needed. Overall, a good experience, but if you can't deliver next day, don't make the promise."
4,chef's choice 610,"Nice unit, compact, easy to use, easy to clean and maintain. The only complaint I have, is we tried to slice some smaller pieces of deer meat thin for making jerky and it did not work well. If you are slicing a harder or larger substance like ham, roast, etc. I think it is fine, but smaller softer meats are hard to slice. It kept pulling the pieces through and getting stuck, rather than slicing very thin. We haven;t tried to saw through bone yet, so I dont know if things like deer leg steaks or ham steaks are possible with this machine."
3,Not as good as reviews indicate,"Having owned this device for more then a year now, I can safely say even with the non-serrated blade which we bought after the fact, you absolutely cannot achieve a ""shaved"" ham like you can from the deli. I would suggest that you look elsewhere if you are trying to achieve such a thin cut, however as I have not found such a product yet I am open to suggestions."
4,"Great Slicer, bit tricky to clean.","We've used this slicer twice since Christmas. Once to slice up deer meat and once to slice a roast into steaks. It does a great job. It would have gotten 5 stars, but it is a bit time consuming to clean and the meat seems to get stuck in very hard to reach places. Other than that, its a great slicer for the money."
5,Premium slicer on a budget,"This is my first, and quite possibly ONLY food slicer I've owned. I cook A LOT, for our familiy of 6 and this slicer makes everthing so much easier. I saw one reviewer said that she bought a special blade for slicing ham, I didn't know they had a special blade just for that, but the one that comes with the machine did a SUPERB job on slicing MY ham, roast beef, cheese, bread, etc... When I bought this I was wondering if it was actually neccesary because I didn't think it would get much use, but as it turns out everytime I put it back in the pantry, I have to take it right back out again, because there's SOMETHING else that I can use it for. This thing is great, durable, reliable, consistent...."
5,Meat slicer,"I had always had to throw away the remaining 2-3"" of a roast because I just couldn't slice it thin enough. With the food slicer, there is NO waste. It is the perfect size for the home and I'm very happy with my purchase of this item."
5,"So far, so good","I have only used this slicer a few times, but I am very impressed with how easy it is to operate. I think it is a good investment because it does add that ""deli quality"" to the taste of ham and beef. I also use it to slice my home made sour dough bread and it does a terrific job. Clean up is a breeze."
2,Not what I was hoping for,"After reading the mostly positive reviews, I was expecting the slicer to slice a lot thinner than it did. I sliced both a tri tip roast, and chicken breasts. It just didn't make the very thin slices that I wanted. I would rather use a knife and not have to store this. I would return it, except I'd only get half the purchase price back."
5,educated opinion,"I was in the restaurant equipment business for over 35 years and sold hundreds of comercial slicers such as Hobart, Globe etc. This is not a comercial machine but it thinks it is. It does a supurb job of slicing from paper thin to a thick slice of rye. I don't use it as often as I should, but it is relatively easy to clean and a great addition to any kitchen."
2,Disappointed,"I slice many whole pieces of Italian meats - Salami, Mortadela, and procuitto. This slicer is a basic, economical home slicer and does not perform anywhere close to a deli slicer. The unit itself it to small to take a large product and the blade runs to slow for doing a good job on hard cheese. The engine actually starts to smoke on the tough jobs. Additionally, it really can not achieve a super thin slice - it is just not that robust.But, what do you expect for $100?? It does slice and for small products and a limited amount of slicing it can do the job.If you want to slice larger pieces and/or achieve thin perfect slices - move to a bigger blade and more powerful engine."
5,Exerllent food slicer,"I bought this slicer in November 2008 and have been happy with the product since then. It's been working perfectly and fit all our needs. We normally used it to slice half frozen meat. We cut lamb and beef to paper thin slices for hot pot or beef to 2-3mm for bulgogi(Korean grill). It can make the work done quickly. I actually enjoy to operate this machine and help friends to prepare their food as well. It's a very worthy purchase and we highly recommended to our friends. Before I bought it, I checked the reviews here and also a friend who had owned this product for a couple years. Some people also my friend complained the plastic screw to cover the blade looks fragile and has to be removed with care. It seems this problem has been fixed. Now there is a notch on the cover and you can easily twist it with a quarter coin to open or fasten it."
1,Chef's Choice 610 Premium Electric Food Slicer,"Had expected the product to be more durable. Even before the first slicing, attempts to remove the blade for first cleaning had failed because the center of bland plastic tab broke in my hand. Instead did a simple wipe prior to slicing. After first cutting needed to remove blade with a screwdriver - improvised by myself in the slots. Basic cutting function is acceptable but of course no great motor speeds which shouldn't be much of a problem with non-meat foods which I plan to be slicing in a normal household amount of use."
5,"Slicer is Excellent, Cuts Paper Thin any Meat","This slicer is great and we love it. Cheese, Carne Asada, Vegetables, Chicken Breast no bone, Boneless Pork. Works on all these and cuts paper thin. Locking washer and nut that hold blade must be taken care of as it tends to get tight easily and sometimes hard to take off. I use pliers sometimes or a flat tip screwdriver if this happens. It doesnt disrupt the operation or safety of it but takes longer to clean due to it. We have saved a lot of money buying in bulk at Costco and buying the block cheese and meats. We slice it at home now just like the deli's. Food taste Deli Fresh and stays well longer due to this at home. This a much better and versatile option over a Mandolin that we thought of buying at first."
3,Bought on clearance,"For the clearance price, it was a good value. It looks cute hanging in my daughters room."
2,This is not famous Elis Regina,"When Elis Regina became the master of vocal Brazilian music, she had recorded 4 albums with no expression just because she could not exactly choose her repertoire. She has always denied those albums as quality albums although her voice had ever gained recognition.Famous Elis Regina was born when she signed to Philips Records and recorded her fist single in the label ""Arrastao"" and her first album ""Samba Eu canto Assim"" available here @Amazon.This ""Presenca"" album was recorded at Columbia Records/Brasil and is one of those 4 ones to be neglected."
3,Dirt jockey.,"This is a good game but there r things that i do not like about it. First this is like a kids game so u would think that it would be easy. Wrong, it is on of the hardest games for the ps1. The controls r messed up and it is hard to control the equipment. At the begining u have to do training lessons for each system that u use. That is the hard part that i cannot beat. But when u beat it it starts to get fun but challenging. This game has sort of good graphics but they r blockey. This would be a great game if it was not so hard."
5,Gets Better With Each Incarnation,"I've had three previous Palm models and based on a week's experience with the TX, this is a major step forward. I only had one problem installing data files from the previous version--probably due to my not reading the instructions carefully--and Palm customer service got back to me within a day and the problem was solved. The WiFi works well--although not quite a sensitive as my laptop. I wish the battery could be replaced. I found that after about two years with my previous PDA, the charging process started taking many hours -- which, I assume means the battery was getting tired. Other than the battery issue, I have no complaints and I feel that the TX is a good value."
3,"Beautiful screen, thin body, speedy processor, awful battery","I have returned 2 TXs to amazon -- first time i have ever returned any electronics bought here. Battery life is terrible: will be 80% when i go to bed with the machine off obviously and 18% when i wake up and i have to do a soft reset to turn it on. Tech support tells me either to charge it for 3 hours or 5 hours or you can charge it for longer if you have to. Not much help. One time, i was able to look at the measure of battery draining (tap the time and see how much the battery is charged and watch it drain...). If it works this time, fine; if not, I am off Palms. I do like the large screen though and the body of the device is thin."
4,"Great, durable product","I use this Palm for just about everything possible: balancing my checkbook, at work, as an mp3 player, planner, books, memo pad, internet, alarm clock... I take it everywhere, and I definitely need a hard case, since I use it so much... I have used several Palms, the Vx, Zire 71, Zire 72, LifeDrive, and the TX. This is by far the best, it has no flaws from the manufacturer, and is an attractive looking product. Stable operating system, fairly zippy too. Decent price compared to the LifeDrive too. The only problem is occasionally when you use memo pad and try to bring up a message, it resets, and you need to reenter the memo on your pc. I use memo pad a lot though, this may only be a problem if that's the case (I have hundreds of memos). Overall, good product."
3,Palm TX not Vista x64 compatible,Love the Palm TX itself but was disappointed to find out that it is not Vista x64 compatible. I checked out the Palm website before I bought it and the site implied that except for a few features it was compatible with Vista. It doesn't mention that only applies to the 32 bit version of Vista. I enjoy the WiFi ability and like being able to read email and view limited websites when I travel. The media player does not view all jpg files or most movie video formats so I am unable to view attachments to my emails. I understand there are add on applications that I can buy to add these features. Another drawback is the bundled Documents To Go package is not full-featured and will not allow viewing of pdf files.
4,Good Machine,"I bought this for the WiFi....and it is very solid. I can check my email with ease when a PC is out of reach (which is frequent for me).I use it for work as well. I have 'synced' multiple applications that are pertinent for my work. It is very helpful.I also use it for online games...a fun way to burn time.Sometimes it freezes, but a reset fixes the problem. The machine can be a little 'quirky' at times...overall, a solid performer...The WiFi is KEY!!!"
2,Problem with battery... won't buy again!,"I bought a Palm TX about 3 years ago. At first I loved it! Everything worked great. Within the first year, the device started freezing on me for a few minutes at a time. The battery started lasting shorter and shorter periods of time, until finally the device wouldn't even turn on. After talking to the customer support, I now know that to replace the battery, I have to ship the device to Palm. I will pay for shipping, and they will do the work for me for $149. What a rip off!"
1,"Once a great product, no longer","I'm not exactly sure who to blame for the problem - but here it is:Palm TX was great - once.Palm TX (nor any palm from the Googling I've been doing) does not hot sync with Vista (especially Vista 64, which I have) and Palm is doing nothing about this. Why?The Palm Desktop software (and hotsync tool) was made by a company called ""Access"" which is mostly defunct now.All newer PDAs run Windows for Mobile devices and those will sync.So - if you're running Vista or at some point will be upgrading your Windows XP box, don't expect your Palm to sync if it is not running Windows for Mobile devices.I'm saddened that Palm would show so little support for a good product. Me? I'm going to buy a PocketPC to replace my working Palm TX. I'll give that thing away."
4,"So far, so good","After about one month, I am well satisfied. I am cautious, however, as this one replaced a Palm T|X that started failing just over a year after I bought it. Parts of the screen no longer responded to the stylus."
3,Lost Reliability - I'm going back to an analog-life,"I have been a Palm user ever since they were owned by 3Com and haven't switched to a smart phone... yet. I was a brief Pocket PC user but that platform sucks.This product was to replace a LifeDrive that died and frankly was never more than barely alive. Although it is already more dependable than my LifeDrive I have had continual problems with syncing, resetting and just plain poor reliability. It may be due to 3rd party software I have downloaded but even still in this day and age of tech ""necessity"" these things should be worked out."
5,Palm TX,"It took a little getting used to as I had a dell axim before. But once it was up and running I must say I prefer the Palm to the Microsoft windows platform. The only problems was that my ebooks were not compatible, that wasn't a problem for long as there is a handy ebook format conversion program free on the net..just do a search for it. The built in wifi is very handy too and you can turn it off with ease. With my old one I had to take out the wifi card or it would constantly alarm me about available networks.I love it!"
1,Poor support,"This was the fifth palm device that I have owned. Unfortunately, it will be my last. The device worked well but one day a turned it on and there was big black spot on the display and the screen was washed out with lines across it. However, the screen was not scratched or cracked. I called Palm Support who told me that they don't cover broken screens and it would cost $140 to fix. I didn't do anything that I can think of to have broken it. I didn't want to pay that much money for something that can be broken so easily, so I've moved to a Blackberry Pearl. I've stuck with Palm for so long because I am used to the operating system and have purchased a fair amount of 3rd party software. The Blackberry OS is actually much easier to use. I would recommend that you do not buy this product."
2,This is an unreliable product - look elsewhere,"We bought this for my husband's cousin who graduated high school and was going onto college. She absolutely loved this product at first. However, after 2 weeks, her palm stopped charging. So we sent it back to get a replacement.Now after a few months with Palm TX #2, the second one will no longer power up and she has to send it for warranty repair.We wanted to give her a nice present which worked properly and that she could be productive with. Instead, we end up with two different ones that don't function which need to be sent back.In all honesty, I am embarrassed that this gift has become such an ordeal. I recommend that you look for something else because this is not a reliable product, I will never ever buy from Palm again."
2,"Slow, crash prone","Had to ""upgrade"" from a T5 because of critical software that was going to be supported on TX only. Had no choice, so didn't research processors, speeds, etc. Was hoping TX would be faster. It isn't. Seems to crash more and if anything be slower. Bummer. Can't comment on WiFi since don't use it. Bluetooth works as expected. (I don't really need the WiFi, just Bluetooth at this point.)"
4,Satisified,"So far I have had no problems with my Palm. I only use it for basic things such as the calender and internet, but it's been great!"
3,They've gone downhill,Review I read have nothing but power problems for the device (battery going to fast). I have had plenty of issues integrating this into our Windows Domain (user privledges). I'll be sticking with Pocket PCs.
5,Palm TX Handheld,The Palm TX is a good purchase. The screen is clear and easy to read. I like the customization of hot keys for the unit. The wi-fi is an added bonus. I am happy with my choice.
2,Wonderful..if you're lucky,"If the palm TX worked as it was designed to (and you paid for), it would be a fantastic product. Apparently some people are lucky and find this to be true. I have not. Synchronization with the USB cable is a hit and miss endeavor. Web access rarely works. Forget about e-mail. The calandar, contacts, and to do list are useful, but I can do that on paper. I have some games on it and listen to audio on the bus. It's a waste of money as far as I am concerned."
1,ZERO stars...,"I got one of these as a replacement for my Sony Clie (a decent enough unit), and it's been HUGELY frustrating. The stylus is always misaligned, and it STINKS and interpreting letters like ""t,"" ""x,"" and ""f."" Then, no matter how careful you are, it will interpret your attempts at backspaces instead as two ""periods"" so trying to delete a ""C"" that was supposed to be an ""F"" will look like this: C........The little tool bar below the writing box is too close, and if you accidentally ""go outside the lines,"" you can hit one of those buttons and delete - without being prompted - whatever you're doing. BAH!!This Palm is best suited for use as a doorstop, and chiseling your notes into a piece of stone with a chisel would be much less frustrating and nearly as fast.Do not by this product."
4,Convenient,"The Palm TX is very convenient. You have your most important information available at all times, and you can check the internet wherever you go."
2,Palm TX Handheld,I have just received two of the Palm TX Handhelds and only one of them works properply. It keeps going to the wrong applications.
1,Don't Buy A Palm,"Ordered on line from Palm. Received 3 days later. Unit was charged per instructions...does not work AT ALL. The power and synch cord are a joke..you feel like Mr. Big trying to put threads in a needle. The Palm folks cheaped out and did not include the cradle that SHOULD come with it (like my last Dell Axim). Now the fun part..try getting tech support and returns..ok a wasted 2 hours this Saturday AM. Then they tell that I have to ship it back, wait several weeks for a credit on my card...oh and if I want another one I have to order it all over again. Read all the reviews carefully...looks like a nice unit, but way too many synch,power, on off, reset issues. If you are a tech nerd that loves to screw with this stuff go a ahead. If you a bit type A and just want something that works with low hassle, Palm and Palm TX are NOT the way to go. Spend your money somewhere else"
1,Don't Buy Anything from Palm,I purchased a LIFEDRIVE from Palm and I was immediately thrilled with it and I rated it 5 stars. I purchased a metal protective case for it and I purchased a special remote alpha/numeric keypad. I thought it was the greatest of all the Palm devices I had ever purchased! Having left a positive feedback on this purchase I am no longer allowed to make any further comments.But now I have lost ten years of vital data. I had been buying Palm products every since they had a memory of only half a megabyte. Now I have lost all personal and business information that I acquired over all these last ten years. And when I call them for customer support they refuse to be responsible and demand that I pay then to just look into the robleem.
4,My Palm TX,I use this palm to get datas on drug information. I have loaded some apps that helps me answer questions regarding my pharmacy practice. I can also go online and refer some info. But sometimes it is not possible to download some information like those in Adobe format. you can't also stream videos like you tube unless you have special application softwares.
2,Dead Digitizer,"I bought this gadget and it was excellent at the beginning. After a year of use and conveniently after the warranty was over, the touch screen went erratic. Touch on an area and it picks a different location, touch the same area and it picks an area even further away. Draw a straight line across the screen and it scatters short broken lines allover the screen facing all directions. An attempt to calibrate takes you on an infinite loop. Contacting customer service was so annoying as they told me I dropped the product or spilled fluids on it which never happened. I have searched online and discovered this is a common problem with Palm TX, in fact there's a company I found specializing in selling TX screens which should tell how common this problem is. None of the other software suggested to fix this problem solved mine. For anyone reading this review to consider whether or not to buy one, pay attention to those reviewing after over a year of use to make a better informed choice."
1,An Expensive Piece of Plastic and Silicon,"I wish I could give it negative stars for a rating.... After only two months of nominal use, the touch screen of this pos PDA is completely unresponsive. No amount of poking the reset button fixes this and it's now awaiting return shipping packaging to get repaired/replaced under warranty. If you need a reliable PDA, this one's not it."
5,Versatile little device,"I am forced to use a blackberry for work and this is sooo much better than that device. Only thing missing is the phone. Very easy to use, great variety of applications, wifi, nice useable screen, good battery life, and more. Have used palms for years and those who take a little time to learn the power of this device will be impressed. Way more than just a calendar and address book."
3,"nice little PDA, but software is out-of-date","This PDA has a lot of positive qualities, but unfortunately Palm doesn't seem to have really updated the software since it was first released. Just a few items to note:- By today's standards, the browser is old fashioned, and only displays the ""mobile internet,"" not the real internet like many new cell phones, the Nokia N800, and other newer PDAs.- Doesn't support WPA2 wireless security, unlike every other wireless device I've purchased recently.- Doesn't support 802.11g, only 802.11b.For me the lack of WPA2 support is a deal breaker. I don't want to downgrade the security on my whole network, just to be able to use the Palm t|x.(By the way, Palm issued a security patch last year, for which you have to pay $6, but even it doesn't support WPA2 personal. Go figure.)"
2,Palm TX Has Problems,"I have been an avid Palm user until purchasing the TX. I have owned several Palms including the Tungsten E before purchasing the TX. If I only wanted to play games and use it as a database, it was great. My problem was with the Hot Sync. It wouldn't. Even with Palm Support, the TX would just sit there not knowing what to do. I was disappointed with the newer Palm version, but I have switched to HP."
2,"""Coulda been a contenda""","DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT BEFORE READING!!!I bought a TX 4 months ago, used it what I consider normal use and kept it in my pocket where-ever I went. Well, the screen is now totally unresponsive and it looks like it will cost $125 to get the thing fixed! You might as well take the money you are planning on spending on this and just hand it out to homeless people.Its really too bad too. In reality (if the TX actually was built well) it has great features and works really well to keep you connected. But, throwing aside all the garbage marketing slogans and keynotes, Palm can't be trusted to make a rock solid product even after going through how many generations of PDAs???!!!If you can't live without this, make sure you have a lengthy warranty so you can keep getting it replaced every 6 months or less...thats how long I bet they actually expect these to last!"
2,My Palm TX won't hold a charge properly,"I bought mine in October 2005, now it will not hold a charge for more than a couple of days, one charge used to last for about a week, now when my reminder goes off, the battery dies soon after. Other than that, it is a great PDA, but I don't recommend this model for long term use."
4,Palm T/X w/WiFi,"The T/X works very well. I Have not had any trouble with it.Battery lasts well and charges quickly.The WiFi is the key for my use.I can hop on line to retrieve email very easily and keep up with my online buisness.The browser is a little small but with the large screen not as hard to read as others.Handwriting recognition is also a must and works nicely.Have had others (HP's)this has been my favorite.The freeze ups I read about before buying have only occured when I caused it.By tring to push the T/X beyond it's ability,in otherwords I 'confussed it'."
5,The best PDA!!,"I bought the Palm TX three months ago. I am more than confident that it is the best choice in the market, bearing in mind its price and special feautures. I compared my Palm TX with my friends' PDAs (DELL and HP)and I felt proud of it at the end of the day, because of its display and speed. I am not an expert on PDAs, indeed this is my first one, but it has satisfy all my needs and expectations. I navigate through the wireless connection of my office and some times it is faster than my laptop, which is really amazing."
2,A Step Backward,The TX uses a slower processor to conserve the battery. The result is quite annoying compared with the snappy response of the T3. The TX has some nice features but the downgrade in the CPU is a big disappointment. I cannot recommend the TX.
1,Trouble with a great Palm,"The Palm TX is an awesome idea. Unfortunately, the one I purchased from Amazon last week (June 06) was defective (severe flicker on the screen), and the replacement they sent me was also defective (screen will not calibrate to stylus). Although Amazon customer service has been excellent, I have to say I am pretty disappointed. I am going to try a third Palm, but I might buy it locally instead, to prevent (possible) shipping damage. I did buy a protection plan on the Palm - I highly recommend doing so."
3,Unending reset loop,"The TX has a lot of great features, but it has a bad tendency to lock up and refuse to sync. It goes into a non-ending reset loop. This problem has been discussed extensively on the Palm support forums and I did not find a definitive solution. Why does Palm not realize this is a problem and issue a fix? I have a Palm 500 that still works great and always has. I'm beginning to wonder if I upgraded in features and downgraded in quality."
2,Palm TX,"I recently purchased a Palm TX to replace my aging Palm Tungsten T3. I would give almost anything to have my T3 back. I have had repeated failures with Hot Syncing, adding files and software and I am unhappy that the 4 buttons don't activate the 4 primary functions of the Palm, Date Book, Contacts, Memos, and Tasks. One of the 4 must be allocated to turning on the ""menu page."" I do not recommend this device. I would give it only one star, but it does do some things right so I feel it would be unfair to give it a complete failure rating."
2,Buyer Beware,"I've owned two Palm organizers, most recently the Palm TX. After purchasing the TX, I discovered it does not support the media version of the Windows XP operating system. I contacted Palm who said they have no plans to support it.As a result, I cannot use many of the device's features because the Palm desktop software won't run on my 1 year old computer. Not supporting a popular version of the Windows operating system is absurd. Therefore, for my next PDA purchase, I'm moving to the PC platform. Beware folks..."
1,Not a Blank Palm TX,"This may work, but it is not blank. I cannot name it to match my other 2 Palms which are not working, and as such cannot use it at all. I tried all the fixes listed on Palm, but this is not as advertised."
3,Good product,"Great product but very sensitive, any little drop and you will never be able to use it again, super sensitive."
5,I LOVE MY PALM!,"My husband and I both had Palm VIIx's and upgraded recently to the T/X. We're very happy with the full-color and all the new features we were missing on the old one. I don't try to transfer any complicated files, but the ones I ask it to carry get carried from desktop to laptop and vice-versa. The Palm T/X is easier to use than the old one, smarter than the other one and since it's rechargeable, it's stopped eating batteries. Blue-tooth capability lets me access the internet in most cyber-cafes. You can store music and photos as well, either on the T/X or on a memory card. I love the total package!"
4,Pretty Good PDA,"Good pda, great screen, looks sleek, the only issue that I have not been able to link up with my home network, not sure if its the pda or the router, but have tried everything to get it to link up, but have not been able too. Am able to connect to networks that are not password or security protected."
1,A piece of junk.,"I have been a long time user of tungsten2, and wanted to upgrade to wifi, so went out and got the t/x. What a piece of junk. The colors are horrible even when compared to tungsten2, wifi would simply not work in my house (full wifi), called Palm, they said that it's a problem with my network (my Ipaq works just fine). T/X's wifi would not hold, every time it was powered down would take another 5 min. to reconnect, an Ipaq holds wifi even when it's off. Also, streaming music off the web, forget about it, I was informed by Palm that ""it does not do that"". That's great and all, but it was a major reason for my upgrade. Needless to say T/X went right back to where it came from. Bought an Ipaq, could not be happier, colors are awesome, streaming works, wifi holds, what more can you ask for? Avoid like a plague."
2,Not very good,"This is my 3rd and last Palm. Problem is the the stylus does not align and when it gets close it goes out of alignment again. Palm support stinks, they kept telling me to hard boot and when the 3 months of support are up you're on your own (I have had it almost 6 months now). Loved my earlier two Zire 31 but decided on upgrading and some of the features are nice but not user friendly as before. Palm went 2 steps ahead 3 back. Would never buy a palm again."
1,Quality of Design is not #1 at Palm,"Within the initial few days of using the Palm TX, which replaces a lineage of previos Palm devices, including Palm, PalmIII and an M505, I have had unending issues with the digitizer. Apparently this is an issue that has become a part of the Palm heritage since the introduction of the M125.The experience is so bad that I am at the point of forsaking any further relationship with a Palm device. Perhaps it is time to look at a simpler technology that today's engineering mediocrity can better handle -- perhaps a Pocket PC?"
1,Palm TX - WHAT A PAIN - Save your money,"I purchased a Palm TX to help me get organized. I had a Palm IIIc that was great. I never had a problem until it died after several years of service.I can't sysnc the TX to my Office 2003. I have spents MANY days trying to get this to work. There is no one to speak to in this regard and the internet help has been fruitless.I'm totally disgusted with it. It has been a paper weight for the past several weeks, and will probably continue to be one.WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Great!,I like it. Still getting used to the difference from my Tungsten but I like it! Came as described. I like it.
4,Purchase of Palm TX through Amazon.com,Order was filled and sent on a timely basis. Item was as described and in excellent condition. Instructions for start up were straightforward and easy to understand. Tech support offered for lifetime of product. Guaranteed Tech seems to be a good reputable company. Very satisfied so far.
1,almost as bad as the E2,"I bought this (foolishly in hindsight) after my Tungsten E2 stopped working one day. I've had it about a year. It's required a lot of reboots over this year, has had numerous incompatibility issues requiring a lot of Googling the problem (and my oh my are there lots of similar complaints out there on this hunk of junk). And now, it just stopped working. Full battery yesterday, won't turn on today not even when plugged in. I saw it coming... it had been making an odd hissing noise for a few months. And not it's dead. Never again will I go near a Palm product. I'll hold out until I can make the switch to an Iphone... something I've been hoping to avoid. But really, the whole Palm thing should become a distant memory. This item has a short lifespan and before it dies it comes loaded - with problems. Avoid it."
1,Pretty flaky & unstable,"I have bought nos. two of these devices and both were stolen. The first was not from Amazon which had screen calibration problems and OS freezing continually (I can count the number of times that happened with my Tungsten E which I used heavily for 3 years and eventually gave out in good working condition). Anyway, I decided to go Amazon...thinking the problem might be with the seller but alas it was the same thing -screen calibration and OS freezes. I felt little pain when I lost the second one in 2007 (pretty frustrating device then) and decided to try living without a PDA -its been hard. And alas the Nokia E71 I purchased in July 2008 has not quite served well as a PDA/organizer -flaky OS too is you ask me. Now I am back in the market shopping for another PDA and I definitely will not buy the palm TX. I think I will consider a brand change. Maybe HP..."
2,"Good concept, lousy execution","I have had several Palms and have tried for two years to work with this one. Had to buy $100 of third-party software to get it to sync with Outlook and fix assorted problems, and have spent hours trying to recover data, fix bugs, rebuild old contact lists. It's pitiful. The old Vx was a great machine. This, with all kinds of potential, has been little more than a headache and continual fix-er-upper. If you like that kind of puzzle, go for it. If you want a stable platform, a reliable way to sync your data, good battery life, and a good portable Wifi instrument -- I'd say LOOK ELSEWHERE! I wish I had read this review before I bought this beast!"
4,$599 for a Palm TX?,"Um, $599 for a TX? Is it some kind of collector's item now that Palm isn't making PDA's anymore? Give me a break."
1,worst product I ever owned,"My Palm E2 died and I didn't want to start all over with new software, so I ordered the Palm TX. It could't hot sync appropriately, once erased my desk top E2 data and had to reinstall software. The tech support was totally inadequate and I am returning it, never again to have anything to do with Palm."
3,Nice Screen-Outlook Sync a problem,"The screen is great. It is easy to navigate but I am still not able to sync outlook calendar which really makes it less useful. Very frustrating. Otherwise, works well but this is a major problem. All the suggestions on website and message boards were no help. This seems to be a very common problem."
2,Syncing problems,"I have had two PDAs prior to purchasing this one and they each lasted several years for me. But I have had this product for less than a month and have had to reset at least three times. Plus, I have had many problems syncing via bluetooth. The last straw was when syncing wiped out my entire address book! Otherwise, all the basic functions work fine."
1,Not reliable!! DON'T BUY!!!,For the first few months when it still works it's pretty good. Almost everyone I know had a very bad experience with this less than half a year after buying it. Feeling lucky? Otherwise don't waste your money because it will die on you one way or another.If you do have a problem don't even think of getting customer service that is actually helpful.
1,Palm TX,"I have now tried 4 new Palm Tx and there was something major wrong with all of them. The screen froze and you had to wait until the battery ran out until you could reboot, it would not synchronize or it would sync only some of the files, or each time you would try to sync it would reboot the Palm and do nothing more. The last one I took to the Palm store for them to setup and they could not get it to work either. Don't know if it is just the Palms that Amazon is selling -- the Palm store said they have not seen this problem previouslhy."
1,"No CD replacement, no support","Don't lose your CD, there's no way to download the software (now).The hardware is good, I actually like it, but the lack of support is awful!"
5,Great Device,"I love this new Palm TX, the Wifi works flawlessly, the video playback is very good! the sound with a good pair of headphones is excellent. The WiFile program allows you to access folders from your computer wirelessly.Overall this is a excellent PDA, Great video and Audio and Wifi is very fast!!"
1,why would anyone buy this?,"Buy this if:1. You absolutely have to use a Palm for whatever reason2. You need the extra computing power and memory over the older Palm modelsDo not buy this if:1. You need it to last more than 6 months2. You actually want to use the email / internet / capability3. you want to use the MP3 player4. you like well designed and up to date softwareThe operating system on it has not been updated since 2004. Its truly frustrating to use.My touchscreen started to get buggy about 6 months after I bought it.The customer support at Palm insisted it was the third party software. But it wasn't.Finally, after rebooting constantly, the touchscreen died -- right after the warranty expired.But I struggled with the touchscreen for about 6 months before it finally died.Honestly, there is no reason to buy palm anymore. I loved the old palm models but the new ones are just so poorly made that they die months after they come out of the box."
1,Beware: screens are VERY bad,"The Palm TX would be a very nice product if it had at least a decent screen. After using it for some time you'll begin to notice that in spite you calibrate again and again your stylus never seems to be right on the target. And you will begin trying to compensate for its behaviour, aiming just a little to the left, or to the right, or lower. Later, things go worse and the calibration program itself goes crazy. You aim to the center of the target numberless times -last time I tried I counted up to 150- and the program never ends. According to what other people have said here and at other forums this problem is very common. It's obvious Palm has had a serious problem with their screens - or at least with a very large number ot them- and it not recognizing its failure. Otherwise it would have to recall a lot of devices. My advice: don't ever think about buying the Palm TX. You're going to regret it."
2,no Wi-Fi,"I bought this PDA after the screen on my Tungsten C gave out, because I wanted Wi-Fi in a small, convenient package. But turning on the radio in this PDA often causes a reboot. Palm finally took it back and ""fixed it"", but it ain't fixed. Now they won't respond to my requests for help."
1,WILL NOT HOTSYNC and palm customer service is TERRIBLE,"Recieved this product 2 weeks ago, will not hotsync with PC. Called palm, who makes ridiculous suggestions like ""borrow a friend's cable"" and ""go to a local retailer and see if they will let you borrow a cable"" and ""try another computer"" and ""return the product to amazon"" they are sending me a new cable. I fear the cable is not the problem and it is the device it self and I will now be stuck with this $300 piece of junk. Without hotsync you have nothing more than a fancy calendar. I am able to connect to the web with wifi and that has been great, however, I purchased this to add software to use at work, and without an original hotsync via usb cable, you cannot add any software to the device."
5,Great PDA - Palm's TX,"Palm's TX is a great stand alone PDA (no phone incorporated into the device).The generous screen real estate, built-in wifi and bluetooth are a real plus. It comes with loads of memory and a SD slot capable of handling at least a 2GB expansion card.It appears as though the stand alone PDA is an endangered species. If you don't need the phone component then this is your device!"
2,Sad state Palm is in now,"I have used Palm products since 2000, but since my T/X ""died"", I won't recommend a Palm product. I lost the ability to connect to WiFi after an update from Palm that was supposed to connect to VPN in a more secure fashion. Tech support is horrible. ""Henry"" and ""Mike"" wasted my time. I am still trying to get warranty service arranged, but I had to fax the proof of purchase and they are still waiting on this fax - I am not sure in which continent it ended up! I was excited to convert over to iPod Touch, but some of the software I needed for work wasn't available until the past few months. I think Palm itself is dying a slow, painful death. Their support for products is horrible and the quality is not what it once was. Try a Blackberry or iPhone/iPod Touch... avoid Palm like the plague!"
4,Palm TX,"Very good product, pretty much everything you would want in a palm pilot, especially if you are using it for epocrates and medical school. Just wish it had more memory."
4,"Great Hardware, the software is old, but now can be upgraded!","I've used this device as my main PDA for a couple years now, and I like it quite a bit. The hardware is quite nice, it is sad that Palm stopped progressing with PalmOS. The good news is, thanks to hackers like the people at [...], you can now easily put your own software on the Palm TX. You can already put OpenMoko on it, and I'll bet soon you'll be able to run Android on it.If you want to try yourself, I've been working on making it easy to do. Check out this video to see how to it yourself:[...]"
4,Palm TX,The Palm TX replaced my Tungsten E. It was bought from a 2rd party vendor through through Buy.com. Delivery was received within the shortest part of the time period given. So far it is working well. It runs all my old software fro the Tungsten E. The only wish is it would be nice if Palm updated the WiFi for better speed.
1,unsatisfied customer.,"I had to recently return my second palm PDA, I could not sync my medical software from my mac os 10.4.11 laptop. My palm would not turn on after trying to reset, I'm still waiting for a refund, for two shipping charges and the price of the Palm PDA.Thank you,Victoria Barnum"
2,Touch screen a sham,"I have had it for 3 years. The touch screen worked for less than a year then dead. The cursor lands now about 1 cm from the thumb. File management is nightmare, never know what are installed and what not. The WiFi for web browsing works better than I expected, 2 star there. Prepare a week of study before you can fully understand how the soft and hard ware pieced together if you incline to give a try."
1,Touch Screen High Failure Rate ruins a good product,"I have owned a Palm TX for just over a year and have had the touch screen fail on 2 of them in that time frame. Yes, they are covered under warranty as long as you send Palm $35 and go through numerous telephone waits re-verifying with yet another person that you have a real problem. I have always owned palm pilots since PDAs first came out. This experience has soured me on the reliability and serviceability of the product. I am now up on a Blackberry device. No touch screen, but it is reliable."
4,still figuring it out,"I'm still trying to figure out my new palm, but it is a lot of fun.I enjoy the ease of looking around on it as well as setting it up on the computer. For someone who is not a computer person this was great."
3,Great Calendar,"Pluses: great calendar that syncs with outlook. Minuses: unless you have T-Mobile or AT&T; you're searching for free wi-fi. Plus, this is a big unit - easy to see spreadsheets, but it's more than a pocketful."
2,Should not have purchased!!!,I purchased this item because my original palm lost it's on/off button so I purchased a refurbished one d/t cost but I have not been able to use it since.
2,chuck w,My Palm Tx arrived on time but does not work. No one is available at the site I purchased it from until next week.
5,Don't know what I'd do without it,The best device I've purchased in a long time. Like having my PC in my hand. Its also a great mp3 player that is only limited in size to the amount and size of SD cards.
1,Unfortunately Palm does not listen to consumers.,In theory this is a great unit. I LOVE the stable palm OS. Unfortunately palm DOES not pay the least bit of attention to their consumers. The battery life is meager.Palm:USER REPLACABLE BATTERIES on a high end unit. I would pay $1000 bucks for such a unit. Medical users can't stop to charge their palm units between patients. The need for user changeable batteries is paramount. Many of my collegues are still using OLD units because the batteries can be changed.
3,palm tx,"I felt that I recieved a used product. There were scratches on it. No Manual and just a CD. It was categorised under ""new"" for some reason.It does work fine , though I would have been happier if it did not have the scratches."
1,Looks aren't everything,"This item looks great, I was so excited until I turned it on and started playing with it. Almost immediatly it crashed, then froze, then crashed again. When it wasn'[t frozen up, it kept telling me over and over again there wasn;t sufficient memory. So I put a 256mb card in it, yet still it was a bust. I've owned this product for less then 6 hours and it's packed up ready to be returned tommorow. Not worth the money i paid for it."
2,buy a cheap laptop instead,"I bought this thing trying to carry medical information readily available in my work. I thought it would work with Linux. It does not.It is expensive for the features: it comes with a slower processor than the current pocket pcs, the construction is cheap, the battery can not be replaced, so one is dead, your machine is over.Does anyone want to buy mine?"
1,Are these all Refurbished....???,"I really want to purchase this item but...after reading some of the reviews I get the feeling if I order this PALM TX is will arrive refurbished. Please tell me if I will receive a NEW or REFURBISHED TX is I order this PALM TX from Amazon. Anybody???? Your 2cent is going to make this decision for me, so any help is appreciated regarding my question."
4,Return to Palm,Returned to the Palm devices from a terrible experience with an IPAQ. The TX has been a good and stable machine. The third party software seems more stable. So far have not had to experience a hard reset. That will be the test. The IPAQ and its Windows Mobile were just terrible when that occured and I purchased the Palm to avoid that experience. For business users it seems that there still needs to be work done on essential business software. I have not yet successfully established a WiFi connection.
4,"bonita,barata pero no tan buena (en español)","Esta es la 3era palm que compro, y estoy un poco defraudado con la estabilidad del sistema, ya que con mucha frecuencia se producen soft-reset que aveces son un poco molestos.(ya que hay que esperar como un minuto para que se restablesca el sistema)El wi-fi es fenomenal y super ràpido, y de gigantesca pantalla ni hablar."
1,SCANDALOUS BATTERY,"I charged the battery for a full five hours before first use. And it lasted all of 5 minutes when I used it. It takes ages charging the T/X and it doesn't last. It's a scam and if I were in the US, Palm would have heard from me big-time."
5,Everything they said it would be,"Palm TX arrived in record time- packed well - functions perfectly.Great price, too! Thanks, Amazon!"
2,Doesn't work with outlook,I have not been able to sync it with my outlook. I spent hours trying without success. The software is horrible.
5,Great!,"I am really happy with this PDA. I was waiting to get a PDA until it was able to actually connect/interact with the world (without costing too much), and this seems to be it! (especially combined with a bluetooth mobile phone)"
1,2006 Price and Technology @ 2011 Price,"Vendor is INSANE if they think they can sell unopened backstock of a 4 year old PDA from a bankrupt (Palm was purchased by HP - they will only support WebOS going forward) company. The product was hardly cutting edge in 2006 when it came out, it is positively antediluvian in the age of the smartphone. Developers have fled PalmOS in droves over the years, you'd be hard pressed to find any new software for it. If you are a Mac user - the last version of Palm Desktop came out years ago and doesn't support SnowLeopard. If you really REALLY need a PalmPDA in 2011 for some reason, scour Craigslist - you'll likely find a perfectly functional used unit of this model for 1/10th of the price this is selling for. Shame on you vendor for trying to foist this off at this obscene price on people who don't know better."
3,Some quality issues,"I have had several Palm or 3Com PDAs through the years and this one has the most finicky screen. I have to press much harder and write more slowly for it to recognize the writing reliably. This isn't too bad for the Datebook and Phone list, however, for writing memos longer than a line or two, I recommend either A) using your computer and then syncing it or B) investing in a PDA keyboard.Also, I find I have to reset it about once a month (I rarely had to do that with previous Palm OS PDAs)."
1,tx is bad-service from palm is terrible,device did not work well from begining the windowns were inverted and the palm kept on going blank - need to keep on recharging it several times a day palm.palm support also terrible had to call three times to get somebody on the line -have to give my name then wait a few minutes then my phone number and wait several minutes then my address and wait several minutes ..... thought they were computerized - then give my email addreesss and wait again several minutes to be told tha i will get an email message in 2 days to tell me what to do but be aware that if you do not get the message to call back- this is the second palm that i bought - the T3 being the first and working-the Tx will be the last product I will buy from Palm in vieuw of the performance of the product and the terrible service-
1,Screen Problems - from the beginning and increase over time,"This is an OK PDA BUT there are definite dead areas' on the screen that simply do not respond at all. That coupled with the worst Wifi make this what would otherwise be a fine PDA. Also note, there is no camera (OK by me) and no voice memo capability.Palm 'support' was entirely useless on this issue. Older Palm models worked better (Zire and 550) although the power connection ports on those rendered them useless over time.I will avoid all Palm products in the future."
1,Palm TX screen problems,"Great product at first, after nearly a year of limited use the screen didn't match up to the stylus contact point and no amount of recalibrating would fix the issue. Some research online shows this is a noted problem with this item.Palm TX Handheld"
3,good but screen has a probelm,i recieved the palm in good condition but the screen was not sensitive & i contacted the dealer who promise to send another screen
4,Great value for the money!,I bought my wife one for her b-day and had to buy myself one 2 weeks later! I compared this thoroughly to the Dell X-51and based on price and performance the Palm TX wins hands down!Excellent buy. The wireless was the primary reason and its works flawlessly!
4,Great Little Device,"Great little device. I've had it a little over a month now and I do like. The office applications are good but I would not want to do anything very large on it. Perhaps the optional keyboard would make it better but certainly the application is usefull. The World Clock is good but I recall older versions were more customizable than this one. For instance the city selection. Viewing the web is good and the browser works okay. There have been times though when accessing web pages were a note would appear stating the web page is too large. On some rare occassions the unit might even go into a soft reset depending on the page you are trying to access. Overall, I do like the unit. I've had older Palms & my last unit was a Sony Clie. The Palm TX is a good but not perfect upgrade/replacement."
4,Best PDA on the market.,"I have tried many PDA`s, but this one gives the best value and quality for the price."
1,Palm TX,"I ordered two Palm TX handhelds as replacements for the Palm products my wife and use. Her Palm synchronized without a problem, but sometimes doesn't advance from day to day when using the navigation button.My Palm won't sync at all. It keeps shutting down with each attempt. The only way I can get it to sync is to do a hard reset. When I attempt to sync a second time it shuts down like before. I've tried to set it up on different computers with the same results. I'm puzzled about the way these two identical products function (or don't in my case.) It appears I have a ""lemon.""Len"
3,Palm TX,"Just purchase this great product, but Palm's website support is poor. Many unanswered questions on the forums. Sent an email on a technical question a few days ago and no response. The latest software and drivers are dated. I'm concerned about the longevity of Palm. Mac support is minimal."
4,Palm Tx Handheld,"Good product. Took a bit to get it set up but after that it seems to work fine, with the exception of the sync cable which did not work at all. The cable seems to have a short in it and would reset the computer it was attached to whenever I would plug it in when also connected to the palm. Other than that I would recommend it to others."
2,Palm TX Handheld,"Bought this PDA in 2007, mostly for my work schedule and ePocrates, a pharmaceutical software, for quick reference of medications. I have had previous versions of Palm PDA, and always liked their innovative advances. However, just about when iPhone/iPod Touch started to take over smart phone/PDA arena, Palm shifted its emphasis away from PDA and started to concentrate on smart phone only. I still use it for logging my swimming distance, but I now use iPod Touch for calendar and ePocrates, which are much more functional than Palm's versions. It is what it is; in this competitive world, if you do not continue to innovate, you lose the market share quickly, and you become obsolete.If it is still $300 or so, I would buy iPod Touch instead in a heartbeat."
4,Palm T|X Review,"When I found my Palm T-3 faltering I ordered the T|X as a replacement as remaining with the Palm OS meant instant compatibility between the two PDAs when I sync them on my PC. This process worked perfectly.In daily use there are some pros and cons about the T|X:PROS: The Palm OS; a leather screen cover is included; better color screen than the T-3; media and MP3 capability; Documents-to-Go works great with Office 2003 Word, Excel, and PowerPoint; wireless connectivity, and it is not a cell phone.CONS: No button on the side to start a voice recorder function, its very hard when driving to dictate myself a memo; the buttons sometimes don't respond with first or even second push; and I never have been able to get Outlook to hookup with the T|X (VersaMail?)All in all, the T|X does exactly what I want it to do: maintain my calendar, contacts; pictures of the grandkids; handle my Excel, Word, and PowerPoint files; and do so simply and reliably."
3,"New, Used, Warranty from Palm?","Regarding the reseller: I was surprised when I received at T/X wrapped in bubble wrap instead of the original box. The vender did not say whether it was refurbished, returned, . .During set up the T/X froze, then shut down. The resets did not work as they should have, so I will be returning it for a replacement. When on the phone with Palm tech support, I was told that Amazon nor their suppliers are not authorized Palm resellers, and that Palm would not be providing the usual 90 warranty as with new systems.I will update this review when I have a working T/X.Shipping from Palm is free, so buyers should consider what an opened T/X is worth, without a 90 day Palm warranty. Office Depot is looking better all the time. They will replace your Palm on the spot for the duration of the extended warranty period."
2,nice WiFi; lousy compatibility; not worth upgrading,"I've been a Palm user since the very first days, and I usually get around to upgrading to the latest within a year or so of its release. My Tungsten E is great, but I upgraded to the T|X to get Wifi. What a mistake. Many of my apps are not compatible (due to a ?memory architecture? change), and even the software-install flaked out my previous desktop config. I just spent 3 hours fixing the problems and re-installing the old desktop for the Tungsten E. The TX is going back to the store... (If I'm going to spend this much $$ and time upgrading, I'll probably look at the HP or the Dell ... or the other mobile Win platforms.) I like Palm because it was so easy ... true plug and play. They loused this up badly."
4,Palm TX is a great product!,"I've been using my Palm TX for a few weeks now and I love it. The WI-FI feature is my favorite thing about it. I pick up hotspots all over the city (I live in NYC) and can check my email, bid on ebay or get a weather forcast with ease. My prior PDA was the Tungsten E and that had to be replaced because the on/off button didn't work properly after 2 years of use. I understand this is a common problem with many Tungsten E's. I give the Palm TX 4 stars instead of 5 because it seems to use the same type of on/off button as the Tungsten E and I'm afraid it will have the same problem after some use. I'm hoping I'm wrong about this. For now I just LOVE this PDA!"
5,best gift i bought myself,"This is a great product. I am a lawyer and a piano teacher and it helps me keep track of my appointments and my students. The wi-fi feature is great - find a spot with free wireless access and you do not need to subscribe to any other service to get internet access. The screen is clear and photos display well. Maneuvering around the functions is easy. I also enjoy the docs-to-go feature, which allows you to create and/or edit word and excel docs, among other things."
2,Difficulties with HotSync and Instability,"I've been trying to keep a good attitude about my next TX since I've paid $300 for it. But I keep having problems with HotSyncing. For some reason I can't get my calendar to HotSync at all right now (but everything else does). My TX also freezes for no apparent reason requiring a hard reboot at least once a week. When I type in things to do on my laptop, for some reason they haphazardly show up on the list. All in all, there seem to be more glitches with this PDA than the previous 3 Palms I've owned. It sounds like from talking to people at work that Palm is also in the process of changing their OS to something like PocketPC. I'd hang tight before I spent money on the TX.Disgruntled Doctor"
4,Great device but not quite a five-star,"After researching and reading numerous reviews of the Palm TX, I decided to buy it after doubting and doubting for a few days. As a college student, I don't have a lot of money to waste on a $300 organizer, but I'm glad I got it as it is more than just an organizer. This little machine works wonders! The battery-life is superb. I can get up to a week of it with normal use. However, there are a few glitches w/ Wi-Fi...the TX sometimes freezes and a reset is necessary. It can get annoying, but it doesn't happen all that often. I definitely recommend this all-purpose machine. If you're looking for affordability + functionality, then get the TX."
5,Palm TX,"This is a great product. There are some problems with software conflicts. That can cause the unit to turn on by itself or to reboot. If you plan on adding a lot of third party products, I would recommend that you install one at a time. Give your self a couple of days then add the next one. That way if you have any issues you know which product is causing the problem. MS Office 2007 creates problems unless you use a product made to suppoort it. The unit lasts a long time between battery charges, it supports a nice color screen. It is great for storing contacts on because they are easily expandable. I have or 250 contacts many of those with 4 or more phone numbers e-mail etc... The programs the palm supports are compact and still leave lots of memory available for use. I have e-books and over 50 of them on a SD disc, and still have lots and lots of room."
1,Lousiest product I ever bought,"You'd think that a company with as much experience with touch screens as Palm,would make them usable. Not so with the tx. First one developed dead spots almost Immediatelythen came the calibration errors. This piece of junk cannot be accurately. No differenceafter they replaced the screen and the on off switch. I went through their tech servicedepartment and they kept wanting me to hard reset and that didn't help. I can tell em it's asoftware flaw, but they don't admit it. Guess they'd rather have disgruntled customers.Even if you're a palm addict... bypass this offering. It's a waste of good money andalmost useless."
4,Best Technology at the time.,"This was great technology when it was first made available. Technology has surpased it of course. However, I appreciate not having all my information in my cellphone."
2,PALM!?!?!?,"Great PDA, HORRIBLE support. The worse customer support ever. Don't care about satisfaction, rude and stupid."
3,Works for me,"I bought it at Amazon and so far it's been good. Only problem is it keeps shutting down when not in use. You can download free software from CNET and use it. It has Palm Tunes and works well. I was able to add my music, pictures, games and videos on the SD card. The video is not perfect (not like Ipod) but has bigger screen. I like that it has Word and Excell capability. The software that comes with it is okay. The video download to the Palm desktop is so slow. Overall, it's a good and inexpensive and functional PDA but not the best."
2,False advertising,"If this were advertised as just an organizer it would get 5 stars from me. But it has wifi and is supposed to do email and internet. The browser works fine on my home wireless network, mostly. I have been struggling for almost two weeks to send or receive and email message with it. I followed the directions in the PDA manual for set up and I get error messages with an authentication error message. Talked to Palm who said it was the ISP's problem. The ISP says it is Palm's problem. I found another Palm instruction page that gave different instructions for set up from the manual and that did not work. I set up email accounts at hotmail, google and yahoo and the browser on the palm refuses to deliver the front page for google. It just delivers the ads on the hotmail page and no log in. Yahoo refuses to recognize the password. If you want email in a small package for traveling forget this device."
5,CompUSA vs. Amazon for Palm Tx,Upgraded my Palm m130 to Palm Tx. The screen is great. Wonderful colors and resolution. WiFi big advantage over older models. Memory adequate for most uses.Went to CompUSA to purchase based on Sunday ad offering free accessories. Of course they were out of it. From now on I go straight to Amazon. Price was lower and no surly clerks looking at me like I am crazy for expecting to buy a product advertised in yesterdays paper.
2,Limited E-Mail and Wi-Fi Capabilities,"I purchased a Palm TX for my wife, who mistakenly believed that this device would be an inexpensive substitute for a Palm Treo or Blackberry. A representative from the IT Department at her office spent a great deal of time unsuccessfully attempting to get the Wi-Fi feature to work, but she could never get it to receive email or web access from the wireless network in her office. The IT representative said that the office network was not compatible with the ""VersaMail"" feature used by the Palm TX.At this point, the TX became an overpriced PDA, for our purposes. It was returned to the retailer. If you buy the TX and think that you will get seamless access to email and the web, forget it. The internet and email capabilities are limited. Thoroughly investigate whether the TX will work with the email applications you use and in the locations you want to use it, before you buy."
3,Eh...wait for the Apple phone,"I got this thinking it would be much improved over my 1999 Handspring. But really, it's the same thing, only slightly improved.My issues with it:Browser is only average, and doesn't support flash or java, making many websites inaccessable.No microphone, so doesn't do voice notes, nor VoIP programs like SkypeVideo player doesn't support Divx, so you can't watch moviesOffice document reader doesn't support RTF, so you can't read text files or emails.Email program won't do Hotmail even if you have the Hotmail premium.Bluetooth connection to Nokia phones is very erratic, so that doesn't work either.Graffiti is still infuriating to use. You would think they would be able to integrate some handwriting recognition software in the last 8 years.I returned it after two weeks."
3,"Nice, but slow","I love Palm and wanted WiFi, which worked great. However, it's slooowwww on large apps like Mapopolis (very speedy on my Palm T3 w/ faster processor). You can also see a bit of a lag when writing graffiti. Good price if you're new to pda's.BUT, the TX also has a major 'bug' - the 'rotate screen' icon is missing - there is a patch at the Brighthand Forums, but I can't believe Palm would release the TX with this bug!I'm returning the unit because it's slow. Now considering the Dell X30 624mh, or spring for the Palm LifeDrive."
3,Palm TX,I have not used the devise since I purchased it as it was not at all what I expected. I wanted an electronic devise with a calendar so I ordered a Tungsten E2. I already own a Kindle so the Palm TX screen for reading books is not appealing to me. Perhaps in time I will come to appreciate this devise.
1,Lots of flaws,"This was an upgrade from an old Palm. I am very disappointed in the unit. It fails to hotsync on occassion, resets itself if I try to run Zagat to Go, and overall it is quirky and unreliable. I'm sorry my old Tungsten died. I miss it."
4,"Muy buen producto, ningun problema hasta el momento","Hace exactamente lo que se supone debe hacer. La duracion de la pila es perfecta. La conexión wifi es muy sencilla y me tiene al tanto de todas mis reuniones y fechas especiales. Ademas cargo algunas canciones para oir de vez en cuando y fotos y videos de mi familia. Me permite llevar y modificar mis archivos de excel y de word. La uso como despertador y es perfecta para tener todos mis contactos y estoy seguro que todavia no uso ni el 30 % de todas las utilidades que me puede prestar. No pongo las 5 estrellas por que en algunas ocasiones cuando me conecto a internet se ha bloqueado (en 2 o 3 oportunidades) nada importante, pero es algo molesto."
5,Excelente PDA!,"Compre esta PDA hace mas de un mes y considero que es a la fecha muy superior que sus competidoras de todas las marcas, incluyo en esto la LifeDrive de Palm. Tiene un desempeno excelente porque maneja un software optimizado para la memoria que trabaja, la idea no es tener un laptop ni solo una agenda electronica, realmente es un producto intermedio que no busca reemplazar lo uno ni lo otro, solo hace su trabajo eficientemente.He sido usuario de PDA por mas de 6 anos y he podido comparar marcas y tecnologias, en esto Palm sobresale y el modelo TX lo hace dentro de las Palm. Tengo mis reservas con la LifeDrive, no fue una buena idea.Si quieren estar seguros que comprar pueden gastar una buena fortuna comprando y comparando, ahora pueden aprender en estos comentarios y avanzar en un camino ya recorrido por otros sin gastar dinero, acepten los consejos de quienes ya pagamos para disfrutar de buenos productos. La palm tx es uno de ellos, con certeza."
1,New TX for wife has no WiFi,"Just bought a new TX for the wife, and it did not have wifi. It did not have the icon at the bottom next to Bluetooth. It did not have any files listed under ""Info"" that had to do with wifi. And it did not have an application for Wifi in Preferences/system.Got a bum unit. I spent hours trying to troubleshoot it, and doing research on the internet at sites like palminfocenter, brighthand, even palms user forums. No answers. This sucks. Wish I got paid for it all. It was just a waste of my time.I'm frustrated and angry."
2,"Thought it would be great, but...","I did a lot of review-reading as I got ready to purchase a new PDA. I had a windows-based PDA that was okay but too expensive to replace. The Palm TX had great reviews in a lot of places. Basically, I need to look at documents, use some medical software, take notes, and occasionally surf the web. The Palm TX seemed like the best option. But after purchasing it, I was unhappy. The handheld is slim, but the protecting case is difficult to apply and wasn't adequate for protecting it (adding another case, like I did, added to the bulk). In addition, the handheld froze frequently, necessitating multiple soft resets. I figured that if it was going to do that within a week, it wasn't worth keeping. I returned it and bought an ipod touch, with which I am VERY happy."
4,PDA,"Arrived quickly. Software available is great. Cannot get it to print to an IR printer. Otherwise, it is great. Can do anything a laptop can do."
2,PALM TX,"This Palm TX is mediocre, at best. The serva mail, web, and other applications are clunky. I would not get it again."
4,I love this PALM,"I have been using this Palm for 4 years probably now. The one and only issue is that over a year ago the power button stopped working so I have to turn it on by using one of the shortcut keys like the home key and to turn it off I have to wait for it to time out from inactivity and turn of it's display. I've completely opened it up hoping I could clean out a contact or something but no luck. This is an annoyance but one I've learned to work around.Otherwise, this thing has been rock solid. My entire personal and business life revolves around it and it has never failed me or crashed even once. I've used windows hand-helds in the past and just don't feel like the windows interface scales well to this type of device. Palm is the way to go for PDA and this model is great."
4,Worth the trouble to set up; nice features for business.,"The TX was my third try in replacing an old Palm which would not sync with my new Vista computer. The first two tries were Windows Mobile os devices (HP IPAQ & Palm Treo Pro). With windows mobile, I could not get not modify my Office documents on my PDA and sync the info easily back to the computer. With DataViz for Palm os I can do so seamlessly. Also the Palm os allows me to quickly search within my memos by word - something neither other device will do. However, the Palm TX has been very difficult to set up on my computer and I am still trying to figure out how to get the bluetooth sync to work. I don't think Palm has properly updated it's installation software or user manual for Windows Vista, although the device does work fine on it. However, you can call customer technical support. I never seem to have time to look up the number or call them during the hours they are open. (I am self-employed)."
5,Palm Tx,"I recived the product by the date it shoud, in perfect conditions. I have a good experience in this purchase."
4,Palm TX,I like this compared to Dell Axim 51v (I own for 18 months). But I am still having trouble in setting up wi-fi & bluetooth. Because of that i have given 4 star.
2,Palm does not support 64 bit windows,"Do not buy a Palm device if you expect it to work with 64 bit Windows of any sort and you need USB sync. See their own forums, they do not support it and will not say when they will."
4,Excellent product,"I bought this Palm when my old one died after 10 years of constant use. It took a little while to adjust and find all of the features I was used to, but since I did, it is doing exactly what I wanted it for. For a couple of days about a month after purchase, I had a lot of difficulty with this Palm--It was buzzing and went kind of whacky. But I did a hard reset and now it is back to normal. I endorse this product and recommend it for someone who wants a reliable PDA."
4,Excellent choice!,"This Palm device has really made me happy. I bought it to replace a Zire 72 that bit the dust. I easily transferred all of my information to this newer model, plus it gives me wireless internet access which is really cool. I recommend it."
3,"Nice Hardware, Awful Synchronization Software","The Palm TX is very fast and easy to operate. There's hardly any wait time when communicating with IR, WiFi, or Bluetooth. But, if you plan to hotsync with Microsoft Office XP on your PC, plan on shelling out an additional $50 for Chapura's PocketMirror software. The Outlook conduits included with the Palm TX won't work with Outlook 2002 or 2003."
2,"Nice screen, nice device but have to reset almost every week","Pro: Nice screen, support SD card, 802.11G with WPACon:1. Almost every week, the device reboot by itself and looping it until I hard reset and clear out everything. Then reinstall everything. Seem like this is common since I found other also have the same issue.2. If the system locked up, reset will loop at the boot screen again. Same as 1. Need to hard reset and reinstall everything.3. The web browser is not that great if the site does not support WAP and you will get web page too large.4. Doesn't support wmv format. Yes, you can drag it to the card and the Palm desktop will convert, but it takes soooooooo slow."
4,Why Only 4 Stars if I Love It?,"I've used mine for about a year and a half now and love it. It reminds me to do things. It provides me with lots of music to listen to, of books to listen to, and even books to read, long before the the Amazon product was released. Recently I even paired it with the Jensen Bluetooth receiver and am able to play the contents of the TX over my stereo. I use it for writing emails that I then send later from my pc.So why only four stars?1. The battery life isn't great and the battery is a built in rechargeable, so it's necessary to charge it every couple of days.2. The display, while gorgeous in indoor and subdued lighting, struggles to compete outdoors, making it hard to read an ebook outside.3. I wish it had a microphone built in for taking little audio memos."
4,Should be 2 Stars,"I have had it for a year.B.B. King said it best ... The thrill is gone.This was the first PDA to entice me to upgrade from my Palm VX. It is being used primarily as business Personal Information Manager (PIM).AFTER USING THIS GADGET FOR A YEAR ... MY FINDINGS* In streaming WI-FI mode this baby will suck some battery juice.* The screen on any PDA is too small to surf the web, in my opinion.* The screen is very touch sensitive - nothing like my old PDA. After a year, I still make way too many errors with this PDA.* The ON/OFF button is beginning to fail. It is difficult to turn off.* The operating system is slow and finicky.* On a positive note the screen is very bright and colorful. You can use it as a flashlight.I can't recommend this product. I am going back to my old Palm Vx."
2,Poor screen quality,"I love my Palm Treo 650. It's bright and really sharp. That said, I expected nothing less. What I got when I received the Palm TX was a very dull, glary screen that was hard to read in normal office light. I was disappointed to say the least and sent it back about 6 hours later.I've had three Pocket Pcs. My last one from Toshiba was fantastic. Super bright screen that was bigger than the TX and low glare high contrast. I like the Palm OS better, but will probably go back to a PPC if this is as good as it gets.Mostly, I read ebooks on my PPC and some e-mail. I'm on planes a lot and it's easy to see. This would be very hard to see in a bright and glare-filled room...I'm glad others liked it. Wish it had worked for me."
4,Love my TX,"I had been shopping around for months to replace my Tungsten E, when they announced the TX. Yes, some of the old applications don't work, but that is to be expected when you update an operating system. I don't expect my old windows 96 computer programs to work on my new computer either. I did have to hard set my Tx when I transferred my data the 1st time, because I didn't read the instructions on moving from your old palm to the new one. Once I did that, it was a peice of cake. I love the WIFI, it is a breeze to use. I also like the rotating screen. I always had graffitti 2, so I am used to it and have no difficulties at all. I talked my 64yr old mother who is a teacher to get one, and she is extremely happy with hers. I love the plams, I had family members lining up to try and snag my old E."
4,Overview working Nice,"The color and running speed, seems ok for me. But the synchronization using usb cradle cable, will cause system to suspend that need to be soft reseted sometime."
1,Beware-Windows XP Media Center Edition is NOT supported by Palm!,"Palm will not support its product if you try to install it or synchronize it with MS Windows XP Media Center Edition (MCE). I was unable to make it work, despite the varied fixes I found on the Internet. The Palm technician was NOT helpful, except for the fact that midway in our conversation he said that Palm did not support MCE installations. Palm claims compatibility with Windows XP, but it will not support XP with MCE. Thank goodness that Amazon is willing to let me return my Palm TX, so I'm not out any money. But thanks to Palm's refusal to mention MCS incompatibility, I am out 100+ hours trying to make this work, along with the hassle to both Amazon and me for having to deal with a return. Beware! Bravo, Amazon. Pooh-Pooh, Palm."
1,Palm tech support could not make this PDA work,"My Palm TX was a birthday gift....I spent 7 hours of the big day talking to Palm's tech support. The handheld was unable to access Yahoo email--yes, all the settings were correct and I have a Yahoo Plus emailAfter two days of trying to resolve the issue, Palm gave up and said I should return the item. This problem also occurred on the PDA that tech support was using to simulate conditions. Moral of the story: buy something that works. This product sucks, the tech support was agonizing++. The only bright light was Amazon's customer service. They could not have been better about the return."
4,Needs more featurs like voice note,I had a Lifedrive and It was replaced in warranty twice. I hope it does not happen to this one.
1,I Wish I Could Get A Refund!!!,"Well, I didn't buy this product from Amazon.com, but I did purchase it through Office Depot. However, that is neither here nor there. I bought it and it's just crap. It freezes alllll the time. It does quirky stuff. If I input the numbers 1234, instead of the screen reading 1234 it will say @$?1. Or when I'm writing it will freeze and when I manage to turn it off and back on there will be random scribbles on the screen from my previous writings.It's sooo frustrating to use. I use it in the clinical setting and everytime it has let me down. I've only had it for 4 weeks, brand new...but I really wish Office Depot would take it back. Talk about buyer's remorse. What a piece of trash.And trying to find someone to ""fix"" it is frustrating. Palm has poor customer support and their website is not customer friendly. And Office Depot wont take it back since I've had it longer than 14 days... :-(*sighs heavily*"
2,Not user friendly,"I am not new to computers, but I had a difficult time with this little unit. The PALM customer service was EXCELLENT in trying to help me with each little problem. In the end I gave up and returned the item. There is very little storage so you must purchased addtional memory. Then you have to figure out how to access what you put on the card. I was able to get to the internet when out of town, but could not send an email or read my email. It takes a long time to enter each little letter when trying to send a message. I bought it for my husband to check stats while at a baseball game. Pages would not load. I ran into the same problem.I just don't have time to figure out how to work with this type of computer. So I purchased a notebook. I'm very happy with it."
5,NOT HAPPY,"CAN NOT RUN ON MICROSOFT VISTA , NOT VERY HAPPY WITH THAT. NEED TO USESMY LAPTOP TO PALM TX AND MY ZIRE 72. NOT HAPPY PALM FOR LACK OF SUPORTVERY HAPPY MY PALM ITS JUST THAT WILL NOT RUN VISTA"
3,Palm TX,I am not sure yet about my Palm TX. After two months I still have many problems. I am using an HP lap top running XP Pro. It will not sync with Outlook despite a couple of hours on the phone with Palm's tech support. The tech support is on line though a chat windown. It is awkward at best and very slow. I cannot use the palm as an MP3 player. Again Palm On line tech support was not able to help.It works great as a picture viewer and video player. With a 2 GB card I can hold a ton of my pictures and home movies.All in all I am disappointed in the Palm TX. I wished I had spent the money on an iPhone.
3,Serviceable workhorse,"Old platform with archaic 'Graffiti' written input, limited viewing capability (won't handle Powerpoint well for example), but battery lasts a long time and it is quick. Handles 2GB SD card without crash/problem. Not as slick as Windows Mobile, but there is a lot of software to make it work well as a reference source and organizer. Works nicer with Mac computers than Win Mobile. Advice: I've learned using on Mac with Leopard syncs much easier via Mark/Space's Missing Sync without installing any Palm software on your Mac."
1,Bought and now burned,"I got 2 .. one for me and one for my girlfriend, but now Palm won't actively support it for 64bit Vista. The only way is to hotsync via wi-fi or bluetooth and I don't know about you, but I like my usb cable that came with it.I had used mine as a card reader and without the usb connection, that's been torpedoed.I will never buy another Palm as long as I live. The support is substandard as well as the products. I'll use mine til it dies and that's it."
1,wait til the end of your palm use...,"I have loved my palm for many years. but now the time has come to move on to iphone. someday, you too will have to leave palm, for some reason or another. when that happens, your data is basically GONE. as one of the earliest palm users, i am losing 10 years of data, because it is EXTREMELY difficult to convert palm data to outlook or google or anything else. Palm's database is nutty, and the export functions are LAME and they have been for years, and they show no indication of ever changing. at the end of this product's life cycle, if you want your data, you are screwed. beware. for me, if i had known, it is not worth it."
3,palm tx,"I had this for over a year now and I bought it prior to buying a cell phone. I now have a smart phone and have kept this on the shelf and use it occasionally. The good thing about this is that it's fast and can load vast amount of info on it. The bad is you have to get on the Palm site if you have a problem and then have to navigate to find solution, which at times has taken be several hours even days for email reply. Good product, but terrible customer service from Palm."
1,"can't get wifi or email, palm desktop confusing","Maybe I am a little slow about this kind of thing but I didnt find this product too helpful. I liked the ability to draw on it but the detail is too limited to be useful, I can't get on the web or get email, and there is no physical around store to help me set it up.the notes don't sync with my desktop.it's just too much bother, not the transparent memory aid I had hoped for in a PDA."
1,Do NOT buy this Palm!,"Do NOT buy this Palm! I bought this product in January and have spent more hours trying to de-bug it than I have time for. Who knew recurring appts that do not end until after 2020 will keep you from syncing? or that time zone conflicts will also mess up your software? Tech support's main goal is to keep you from making a warranty claim. If you are super tech savvy or have tons of hours to spend solving problems, then maybe this product is for you--otherwise don't waste your money!"
3,"OK value - good, but not great","Do not pay more than $150 for the TX. The large screen is really nice. The best feature. The large screen is nice for sharing snapshots with friends. I use the TX as a toy. The wifi is nice for web browsing on the road. Video capability is limited. Plays short videos OK, but larger videos (TV shows, movies) do not work well or not at all. Web browser does not play videos. Programs to overcome these limitations are availabe from 3rd parties, but cost extra money. I do not like to spend extra money, hence the low rating. Bluetooth to cellphone connection for internet connection does not always work (yes, I have a data plan). Probably because there is no way to manually set a DNS as I can do when connecting a cell phone to a PC. I would recommend the XO laptop from the One Laptop Per Child Foundation as a better value for the money for a small basic function portable computer over the Palm TX."
3,Not the best device one can get for it does.,"Having owned a Palm III, my first impression with the TX was that it is cheaply made. The TX is slightly bigger than the III but much lighter and feels ""plastic."" The Palm III worked well for contacts and appointments. The TX does a lot more, but not very well. If you want to email, web-surf, and use Words & Excel on a handheld, opt for a device with a finger-size keyboard. For the price of a TX, you will get a lot more by paying only a little more.The bottom line: If you are a diehard Palm user, the Tungsten will do you fine. If you really want more out of your Palm, go for the Treo, or even a Blackberry."
5,I love th is palm.,"This palm is awsome! It does everything I need it to do and more. My whole life is in this. The sound is good, could be better, but what do you expect from such a small speaker right? The video is great. The ease of use for the T/X is just unbelievable. I got my wife one as well."
4,Love this!,I love my Palm T/X! It is a great product but occasionally looses past calendar data. Palm should include better backup programs and then I would rate this 5 stars. I've had to buy Backup Buddy but that works pretty well. I do love the Palm software and look forward to improvements. It would be nice if the calendar could print in color.
5,Total Satisfaction!,Very pleasurable experience in dealing with AMAZON and J&R Music & Computer World shipped and delivered my item faster than expected!
4,Palm TX,"This is my first PDA. I bought it for the usual reasons, to have all my contacts and calendar in one place and portable as I travel a lot. I also wanted the wi-fi feature to be able to get email and view the web when I need to, using a hand-held device and not lugging a laptop around. The web browsing is not so rewarding though with a screen that shows only a fraction of the web page at a time, even with the screen several times larger than that of a cell phone screen. The size of the product and appearance of the screen is great. I like it a lot, but don't love it yet; we're not even at the foreplay stage as of this writing, but I think I will learn to like it more as I use it more. We'll just have to wait to see how lasting this relationship turns out to be."
2,Does not work well with Macs,"While the OS software does work with Macs, it does not work with iCal, and spending the money for the missing sync software will not help you either. The calender is the best feature, however everything else falls short, and if you don't get an expansion card don't expect to be able to save anything on TX. In short, the TX is a bit of a disappointment unless all you want to do is to keep track of your calender."
4,Great product,"I am no computer wiz kid but I like this palm. I can place all my personal and professional information. Great color screen, easy to use, and Its a must have. Thank you..."
3,"It's ok, but...","I bought this product to use the wireless function with my bluetooth cell phone. The first product would not connect and both cell phone and palm blamed each other's product. After 3 weeks waiting for tech support, palm informed me that the screen was bad (even though it was working fine). I returned it for a new model and it had the same issues. I think it would be fine for someone who did not want to use the wireless function, but even when at a wireless hub the internet option never worked correctly.The screen and buttons are easy to use. This product would make an expensive day planner, but would work well."
2,Not worth the money,"I had the Tungsten E and was upgrading. Other than the wifi, I don't consider the TX and upgrade, and the wifi is marginal at best."
3,No Windows 7 64 bit Compatibility,"Be aware that Palm does not hot sync with windows 7 64 bit at this time. I learned this getting a new computer and finding out. It apparently does work with 32 bit windows 7 machines. A lot of frustrated palm users out there right now. Also after 2 years I always develop some sort of problem. This is my third TX. I love Palm softare and the unit is otherwise great, but may leave it soon because I can't deal with the inefficiency."
2,limited,"I can not believe that this item is still so expensive. I bought the palm tx about 3 years ago, and to tell you the truth it is a nice toy, just a toy. it is so limited. the bluetooth work when it feels like it, and to add to that it really only works with the computer. I tried to get it to work with my phone and my bluetooth head set, that was a project with no results. Apps are expensive for this device. the only apps that i did use were the e book and p tunes.I have my device on my wall connected to my stereo. That is only use i can find for it now. if your are looking for a device that can handle spread sheet, get a smartphone. if you want something that you can watch videos with get an itouch. Maybe 3years ago this product was worth it. but it is definitly not worth it now."
1,iPod Touch... DUH!,"In shopping for the best handheld device with the greatest potential for programming, scheduling, and Wi-Fi IMing/emailing, you should be asking yourself why you don't own an iPod Touch instead. Palm's are attractive and the brand is popular, but the device itself is one-eighth of the machine of an iPod Touch. You don't need to shell out the dough for a new phone or $300 organizer. The iPod retails around $200 to $300 depending on memory (8 GB versus 16 GB)."
4,This thing is cool,"I have really enjoyed my Palm TX. The email and wi-fi web features are really great, but I wish the webpages were the actual pages and not text-based. Another thing I really like is that it has Word, Excel, and Powerpoint--the Excel saved my butt on a test the other day! I keep this mainly for the organizer features, which are a lot better than on older Palms or the Ipod touch, which I also have. If you are wanting to buy the Palm for mainly the music and internet features, I'd go with the Ipod touch or IPhone instead. But if you want a nice organizer with some other cool features, I'd say this is the way to go."
2,Careful for continual reboot problem,"My TX is about 6 months old. It has had the problem of continual reboot. Yes, I have 3rd party software (the Palm excuse) but it did not start until recently. If you buy this just make sure you make several syncs a day because it is sure that one day this problem will occur for you too."
1,Disgraceful Product,"I am thoroughly disgusted with the Palm TX. I have had continuous problems with this device and will be returning my 4th one today! What a nightmare! After receiving and returning 3 separate Palm TX's due to power issues, I will now be returning my 4th one due to severe misalignment of the stylus when trying to select items on the screen. What I touch with the stylus isn't even close to what is actually activated on the screen. I don't recall ever having had so many problems with an electronic device in my entire life. What I found even more disgraceful is that if you have a problem with your Palm TX and you return it for repair, they won't send you a new one. Instead, they send you a reconditioned one. To me, that is extremely disrespectful and unsatisfactory. If I buy a brand new device and it is defective, then I deserve a brand new one as a replacement. I really wonder if people realize what a sham this company is - I know I didn't. I do not recommend this device to anyone."
1,Terrible service from repair facility in Pharr Texas,"My Palm Tx worked fine for a few months then the OnOff switch started to go bad. After three phone calls they finally gave me an authorization number to send it in. I sent it insured w the US Postal Service. It was signed for on May 12th. Now two months later and after a flood of emails and phone calls I still don't have a hand held. They can't find any record of it. I will never buy another Palm product. I'm afraid part of the problem is the language barrier of the people on the phone. I can't tell where their accent is from. I have to repeat numbers three and four times for them to understand and they still got my email address wrong(the first time, which led to a delay while I waited for a reply)."
4,MIXED RESULTS WITH MY T/X,"i wanted a top quality palm with the bells and whistles. this is pretty close to it but i had a few problems with the email and web features. granted i am not a techie, but connecting and checking email should be more straightforward. all the other features are top notch and overall i love my palm."
4,Palm TX Handheld,"Bought the TX to replace an older Palm unit. It has WIFI capability and works very well--can even handle WPA-PSK encryption, but not if the SSID is suppressed. Screen is bright and easily readable, and it comes with an MP3 player, picture viewer and can accommodate a 2 Gb SD card. The battery will last several days with daily use, and recharges when it is being sync'd or when the charger is pluged in. It can sync some data direct from the internet, too. The one thing that is missing is an easy way to tell where files are, but I can live with that in favor of the good stability of Palm OS 5.4.9. Well worth the investment and far better than the pocket PC I had before."
4,mixed blessing,I will really like this hand held but the transition from a Sony Clie has been nerve wracking. The sony also is palm powered but there are difference between the palm os5 on the Clie and the palm garnet as used on the palm tx. The worst is the operating system on the palm tx cannot keep e-books from being saved as documents in documents to go if documents and the mobireader are both on the hand held. I bought a SD card and moved the book readers to it. also some of the games don't work properly especially the solitare games. I also bought the keyboard for it since I don't have the patience to enter much data by hand.This was the handheld that I chose over another palm handheld when my sony died. It has been an adjustment but again I will really like it once I have made the adjustments to this TX.
4,Great! Except for the darn power button.,"I'm on my second Palm TX, the first one I had to send back for repair on the power button. After having this one for 6 months or so, the same thing is happening again. I don't ""mash"" the power button so I'm contributing it to a design flaw. Otherwise, it's a great PDA, better than the previous Palm models. The battery life is good, the wireless features are good too."
1,woefully disappointing,"I thought I could depend on Heather Nova. Oyster and Siren are absolutely always in my 5-disc changer, singly or together. Her incredibly true lyrics and ethereal voice deceived me into believing that Heather Nova could do no wrong. Well, now she has. If Heather Nova's previous albums had not been so unutterably gorgeous, maybe I wouldn't regard South as a betrayal. She got lazy, poppy, and boring. All of the emotion is drained from her voice; it's like she's pulling Mariah-Carey-tricks. Just one standout song would have been enough to keep me happy, even if the rest of the disc fell flat...one ""Truth and Bone,"" one ""Paper Cup,"" something true and transportative.But there just is not one redeeming track on this entire album.The only thing I am grateful for is that I managed to restrain myself from plunking down $30 for the import."
1,this isn't heather at all!,"Heather Nova has definetly gone downhill. All of her previous albums were brilliant, but this seems more geared towards fans of team pop."
2,"This is not Heather Nova, this is boring Pop.","Sadly, Heather Nova has become the next classic victim in the big music industry. Her album Siren was original, etherial, enjoyable. I could listen to that CD and would calm down. This album is the complete opposite of all of those. Whereas Siren was more akin to light (true) alternative, this album more akin to a softer Jennifer Lopez, or some other dull repeative pop artist with a beat. Do yourself a favor, do not buy this album, but get Siren to hear how good Heather Nova can really be.Don't get me wrong, if I never ever heard Siren before I would think this album was fairly good, not great. It was a massive let down. Curiously enough, she switched labels, from Sony to V2. I don't know if V2 is owned by Sony, but I thought it strange."
1,Heather Nova at her worst.,"How can anyone say this is a ""more mature Heather""? This is nothing like her amazing previous records, this is like bubblegum pop."
3,"Folksier than ""Siren""","As with her previous album ""Siren"", Heather Nova comes through with another mixed bag of songs for ""South."" ""Siren"" had a shimmering elegance to its songs (like ""London Rain"", ""Heart and Shoulder"", and ""Valley of Sound""). This latest album is folksier and even Beatlesque. My favorite tracks include the bouncy ""If I Saw You In a Movie"" and ""Virus of the Mind"" and the slower romanticism of ""Like Lovers Do"" and the soulful ""Help Me to Be Good to You."" This is not a strong album as a whole, but individual songs like the ones mentioned above will keep it on constant rotation in your CD player."
2,Truly a disappointment...,"Anyone familiar with Heather Nova's past can look towards her beautiful and ethereal albums Glow Stars and Oyster to know that she can do a lot better than the warmed over, pop mess that is South. Though the album starts promisingly enough with ""Welcome"" (which is co-written by Dido), there are only sporadic moments of what has made Heather Nova special throughout the years. It's a shame, really. Nova's never made an album quite as bland as this. It sort of blends in with the rest of the ordinary pop/rock found on the radio these days. A major step down from the underrated Siren, and a large disappointment."
4,Predictabe yet still satisfying....,"I have everything just about that Heather has recordedand I find this collection to have many high pointsand few rough spots. More mature sound. She does have a great voicethroughout and I agree the direction of this cdcould have used less production in places but itstill sounds good when I play it through. I find Ilike it much more after many listens, some cd'sdon't come down with Hits, Hits, written all overthem, they need to be listened too! I would agreewith most reviews, its not her best but her voicedoes stand out. I will be playing this in the mixlong after the leaves fall. Some favorites on thiscollection, When somebody turns you on, Like lover do, Welcome, Gloomy, Virus of the mind."
5,When every man is a poet,"A delicious document that proves that architecture has always been made by and for the people. This book almost always ilustrated by very sensuous photographs aproaches the subject that although architecture is suposed to respond objectively to problems of the inhabitance doesn't have to abdicate of any dramatic expression, and in fact can be enhanced that pragmatism!"
4,good classic,"this is a great classic book - a little sad it's all in black and white, sometimes grainy images, but a wonderful view on what existed in 1960s. i'm sure a lot of it has now disappeared."
5,My Dream.,"As the author shows, you don't need a degree to build practical beautiful buildings. Just the need and some perseverance can do wonders as shown inside."
3,Bummer ... all photos in black and white only,"Great book with great pictures and well organized, but all images are only in black and white, and the paperback itself feels flimsy. Thought it was a great present for a friend of mine, but the B/W is quite a let-down."
5,One Of The Better Translations,"Dante's Inferno is a truly magnificent piece of art that is deserving of an equally magnificent translation. For those of us who are unable to translate on our own, Allen Mandelbaum does a superb job of it on his own. Having both languages set side by side gives the reader a unique perspective and allows the reader to get a better feel for the flow of the poem.The notes and asides that are provided are helpful but the essays at the end of each chapter leave something to be desired. If you are simply reading The Inferno for the pleasure of it then this is the version to get. If you are a scholar who is attempting to get a better understanding of Dante and his works than you may be better off finding a different version."
5,Literary Genius,I had first read this work in my high school English class. I fell in love with the images and the concept of hell being in giant rings. I wanted a copy of it for myself.I looked at a couple of copies of the book until I found this copy. Each page had both the Italian and the English translation which was wonderful to see the original language next to the translation. There are pictures too but I prefered to let the words of Dante paint the pictures in my mind.This translation stays true to the way that Dante had written it. Mandelbaum's translation is very easy to read and will let people take the journey through hell with Dante and Virgil.
5,A palekh box or icon in book form,"The art in this traditional tale is evocative of both the glorious gilded icons of Russian Orthodox churches and the palekh boxes on which folk tales are painted in miniature in bright colors against a black lacquer surface. Or the colored-and-golden domes of the basilica on Red Square. When I found it among her old books and read it to her, I asked my daughter if we should give it away. ""NO!"" she exclaimed, having been as entranced as I by the magical artwork. It is a wonderful rendition that enhances the fairy tale beautifully. I'm sorry it's not available in hard cover anymore, but I am hoping the paperback rendition is as lush as the original."
4,A LAVISH RETELLING,"""The Firebird,"" one of Russia's most famous and dramatic folktales is retold here.The lavishly executed illustrations (a Demi trademark) are appropriate partners for the grand setting of thisstory."
4,The weak...shall confound the strong,"Hey, 4 stars because nothing is perfect. I think the new version of conservative Christianity (which is highly political) is about judgment more than the teachings of Christ."
2,Aggressive,"The book ""Remedial Christianity"" had many good pieces of information that I think EVERY ""Christian"" should know. Especially the scripture background and background on the faith itself. However, the book was also so actively anti-fundamentalist that while I would LOVE to give it to some of my more conservative friends to read, I will.....sadly, never be able to do so.A disciple of Jesus is first and foremost loving, even to one's enemies. Unfortunately, Laughlin's book is a prime example of someone who has gone all out to prove their particular doctrine but has forgotten the command to love in the process. I LOVED the info but was saddened by the intolerance, it would have been GREAT to have been able to give it out to those who REALLY need the info."
4,Excellent Collection,"If the goal of Chaosium was to collect some of the best stories about Azathoth in one place for our consumption, then GREAT JOB.Many of these stories seemed entirely original from a Mythos standpoint. THE SPACE OF MADNESS was intriguing from the standpoint of space exploration, and the plot device in THE PLAGUE JAR was interesting. The poem AZATHOTH and THE INSECTS FROM SHAGGAI were good classics. A few stories, such as THE PIT OF THE SHOGGOTHS and THE THRONE OF ACHAMOTH simply interested me. And then there's the pulp filler that's thematic. Very good overall.My only problem was that the spine was not sturdy. Some of the other books from the same series have held up better. It's not important to everyone, but I like my purchased books to remain in good condition."
5,Best doggy cookies ever!!,"These are the BEST doggy treats, my dog cannot live without them!I am so happy Amazon carries them, it seems all the food stores near me that once carried them seem to not carry them anymore. I have searched every store that is listed on the web site that we have in New Jersey and they all stopped carrying them for some odd reason.THANK YOU AMAZON!!!"
5,Bogie knows his treats,"My large size dog loves these, he isn't an older dog, but I use them to give to him while I'm doing his nails. He gets a half per paw. he really thinks they're pretty special."
2,My dog doesn't like these,"My beagle eats pretty much any organic matter that crosses her path but she won't eat these at all. Also, they don't look like the one's on the box do, with a dark center and lighter outside, they are just brown dryish lumps. I thought maybe I had gotten a bad box so I tried another box but they were the same. Maybe a bad case?"
3,Not for training treats,"These cookies are the size of fig newtons, so are way too big to use as training treats. I cut mine into little pieces, but those ended up being too crumbly. Because of the crumbles, you can't put these into toys that roll out treats, either.But my dog did like the taste! I'm just not the sort to hand out a whole cookie to my dog."
3,Blue Dog Equals Happy Dog!,"Blue Dog's Peanut Butter Softies rock! My doggies loved them. I usually buy my organic dog treats from doggiemunchies.com, however they don't offer peanut butter treats. So now I have two awesome companies I can get totally organic dog treats made in the USA from Amazon!"
2,My dog doesn't care for them,"My dog, a German Shepherd, didn't think much of these. Her favorite treat, chicken jerky dog treats from a store that starts with ""C"" and ends with ""ostco"", she scarfs up very quickly and with real excitement & enjoyment. These Blue Dog treats she sniffs and won't take.They do LOOK tasty to me though, to the point where I want to take a bite. Maybe I would like them more than my dog does."
1,Made my dog sick,"I have a young, healthy, athletic Boxer and he had diarrhea so bad he had accidents in the house 3 times and moped around for a whole day after I gave him some of these cut up in his Kong treat puzzle toy. Boxers can have touchy stomachs and he has had a touch of diarrhea before with a new treat but never anything like this. Even the time he got hold of some chicken wings it wasn't this bad. I recently purchased a carpet cleaner and was never so happy to have one on hand, I used it 2 times that night and once again in the morning. If your dog has any sensitivity introduce these slowly or just pass them up, there must be something in them that takes some getting used to."
1,Horrible Smell & Dog can't stand them.,"I can't believe all the high ratings on these. Like one of the previous reviewers, my dog hates them. I'm not sure I would eat them either if I were her as they don't smell like Peanut Butter at all - though I wasn't willing to taste them myself due to the horrible smell. My dog's willing to eat anything I've ever given her, food or treats, but with these she takes it from my hand and then spits it out on the floor. For the first box, she would come back and eat it an hour later (while looking up at you thinking ""you've got to be kidding me""). After that, she said ""no more"" - she just left them there and never game them another thought."
5,Great for senior dogs!,"If you have a dog with missing teeth or a senior dog who has trouble chewing, this is the treat to get them. Your fully toothed dogs will like them, too."
5,#1 O-Town Fan,This song is awesome. The video is even better. If you are as big of an O-Town fan as me you know how good it is. O-Town Roxx!
1,HORRIBLE,this song is just annoying. it sounds just like everything else you hear on the radio...only worse
1,Agony,"I have never been an O-Town fan, but last fall everyone was raving about this song. So, being the fool that I am, I went ahead and bought this single.The more I listen to teenybopper boyband music, the more I hate pop. And you should know that I am a self-proclaimed rock -n- roll & pop lover. But these guys... I feel embarrassed for them. Really. Not only did we suffer through months of hearing them wail off-key (now you know why rehearsals aren't filmed- it's a very good thing to NOT show how the band is made), we then got to see them become these overly lust-crazed teen heartthrobs. (Is it me or are most of them ugly?)As you may have guessed, the song didn't make me think much of the band. I liked ""Liquid Dreams"" but hated ""All or Nothing"" and personally think ""We Fit Together"" was possibly the worst boy band song of last year. But hey- it's your money."
4,Thought-provoking and dark,"I decided to watch this film at first because Julian was in it, and was suprised to find it very watchabable. It examines a side to people that most 'safe' and glamourised films don't - the darker desire in the human condition. Michael is a man who has it all and most people would think thats what it takes to satisfy a person, but as this film shows, you are always driven by that one thing that you can't have. Despite his guilt about his family and her youth he is drawn to Magenta because she is forbidden and the passionate affair he has with her not only gives him an amazing rare rush of adrenaline but it opens up his eyes to the facade of those around him, which creates interesting twists in the film that shatter his perception of his 'perfect life'.Magenta is innocently beautiful but still seductive which makes him attracted to her more. Their lust overflows and eventually becomes destructive and ends in a way you wouldn't imagine.."
5,Fun for all ages.,When I first read Noggle Stones I didn't know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised to find it very easy to read. The world was immersive and the characters were fun and believable. It contributes to a genre filled with heavy hitters but comfortably finds it's own niche. For .99 cents this is kind of a steal. I recommend this book to anyone interested in adventure stories.
3,WHITE THIGHS,I had read the original White Thighs years ago in Japan. This version is not anywhere close to the original. Not Happy with it
4,Cliffhanger review part 3 part 1 on Cliffhanger DVD reviews part 2 on Cliffhanger/Vertical Limit double feature reviews 7.5/10,Back to my review. Micheal Rooker & Jenine Turner were the support & I liked how early on there's tension with Gabe & Hal after all Sarah was Hal's Girlfriend. The stunt work is great it wasn't any p*** CGI which is exactly what the remake will be. Yeah dumb @** Hollywood remaking a good action flick cause there's no originality left that's all this decade has been bad remake after bad remake with a huge drought of good action films. Oh yeah Razzie's can go f**K themselves nominating this movie back in the day.
1,Horrible,"One of the worst books ever. Boring, predictable plot along with a bland writing style and a lame attempt to be 'ethnic' with occasional blips of Spanish. Add that to the fact that it was for one of the worst English classes I have ever taken (from a teacher who was clearly having an affair with the author), and you get an awful combination. I would not wish this book on my worst enemy. Do not buy this and give this hack any more money!"
1,My thoughts,This book sucked. Don't read it. This is a very poorly written book. IT is also very boring. I was forced to read it for a class. :(
3,"Good spark, repair prone",This controller is easy to install and puts out a good charge. I have needed to send in two for repair in the last three years. One was under warranty and the company offered good customer service.
3,An interesting lesser work,"With Muriel Spark's 2006 death, I had an interest in reading one of her less well-known novels. ""Robinson"" was worth the trip, but it should not dethrone Spark's masterpieces ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"" and ""The Abbess of Crewe"" from their rightful place at the top of the list of her novels.Robinson uses the genre of ""wrecked on a desert island"" to explore how people's true personalities come out in this unusual environment. An interesting side-riff is the contrast between Roman Catholic veneration of religious objects and quasi-pagan beliefs in lucky charms. The novel has an interesting plot twist that maintains the reader's interest to the end of the book, but the prose is stilted. Too often the narrator makes double comments on what she said, what she thought, and what she now wished she had said. This gets tedious.Careful reading of an author's minor works can enhance our enjoyment of the masterpieces and that is the case here."
5,fun and interesting read,"This is one of those types of books that gets me into trouble. I really couldn't put it down! Yes, I was supposed to be studying for class... yes, I was supposed to be uploading stuff for my club... oh and what about the dishes! Well, too bad! I've read all 3 of Jane Bee's adventures and loved them all. The characters, even minor ones, are interesting; the plots are complex and keep you guessing; the descriptions of the castles/houses and London life are in-depth and fun to read. I definitely recommend these and hope there will be many more. Congrats to C.C.Benison, a fellow Canadian! Well, I'm only half Canadian..."
4,Interesting idea and place for a muder mystery,"I enjoyed reading this book, mainly because I am interested in the lives of the Royals. It is a clever idea to write a mystery featuring the queen. However, as for the plot goes, it is unnecessarily complicated with too many red herrings. A good travel companion book, or if you want a mystery book on a rainy day on a camping trip, or want to escape to a different world from yours."
2,Much too improbable,A story must be somewhat believable for the reader to get involved and this is so improbable that I gave it up half way through. The idea of Queen Elizabeth not only telling personal things to an unknown housemaid and that housemaid questioning her and other high officials was just too silly. And the idea of footmen running naked past the royal rooms was too much.
3,Will we get lucky with Volume Three?,"More of the same type of repeats bombard Volume Two in the Motown Connoisseurs series, but like Volume 1, there are some rarities thrown in by The Four Tops (What You Gonna Do With me Baby), a rare B-side by The Vows (Tell Me) and a couple of pre-Motown recordings by Freddie Gorman (Take Me Back) and The Fantastic Four (Don't Tell Me I'm Crazy). There are also a couple of rare singles, If I Could Give You My Heart by The Hearts of Stone and Blackmail by Bobby Taylor. These are the tracks we can be most grateful for, but the rest is just yawn after yawn of repeats. As yet, no rarities from The Supremes and I'm wondering if our friendly compilers of these discs remember them. Will we get lucky with Volume Three?"
2,TYR's greatest mistake,"These goggles reminded me of the old spectrum TYR goggles, a great silicone gasket set that never leaked and lasted for litterally years (I wore mine for 2 years without issue). I was so impressed with them that I thought I'd try these out.I was severely dissappointed. These goggles leak like mad, and tightening them only makes things worse, since the nosepiece is not adjustable. Shame on Speedo and TYR for making so many models without adjustable nosepieces!! It's impossible to control leakage if there is excessive, turbulent motion to the face, so expect to get an eyeful of chlorinated water after that flipturn.Stray far, far away from these. If you want a soft silicone gasket that will last and practically never leak, stick with TYR's tried and true Racetech style, or even better, try to track down a pair of the discontinued spectrum goggles (good luck)."
2,cost to much!,great book in very good condtion but cost was way to high. 125.00 dollars for a book that originaly sold for 28.00 dollars. give me a brake.
5,Cold War Historian,"A very informative reference book for those interested in the history of the Cold War era and the follow-on efforts that remain in effect.This book, along with US Strategic and Defensive Missile Systems 1950-2005 authored by Mark Berhow, can answer many questions for not only historians, but also for those who might have lived near some of these Cold War facilities without understanding what was there, nor why they were there."
4,Cold War Footnote,This book is an excellent history of a nearly forgotten footnote to the Cold War - recommended reading for anyone interested in military history or who is unaware of how warm the cold war actually was.
2,Not what I expected,As former missileer I found a lot missing. 12 more words are required ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
4,Undisputed Truth review,The melody from this group will take you on a long trip to soul-land.More and more music from this group will indicate how one of the best Motown groups was not given enough publicity.Let me tell you that this album has put the group back into the living room of those serious R&Btologists.
1,Shoddy and fragile.,"I received this product and was initially pleased. However, in only two days of use, the belt clip broke, the front of the case opened on impact, and my iPod fell two feet to the ground. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,belt clip cheaply made and broke under normal use,"I bought this case a few months ago, and I've been very happy with the build of the case in general. However, I depend on a belt clip all the time, and yesterday the cheap plastic disc holding the belt clip to the case just snapped off. I've never abused this ipod, and I'm very gentle with it. The belt clip attachment is not sturdy enough to hold the weight of the metal case with an iPod in it. Beware!"
4,"Great case, cheap belt clip","I have had this case for over a year now. I have dropped my ipod countless times and it still works great. The case is scratched up but it is still holding up. Even with the case you can still easily work the scroll wheel. However, the belt clip is poorly designed and the ipod is easily knocked off. It is frustrating because you cant even use it when you are exercising because any little jolt knocks the ipod off. So as long as you only need a case, get this product."
3,"It works, but you must be patient.","I purchased this AHA peel for its natural ingredients and for its lack of dangerous chemicals. It only has 5% AHA, which has provided results over time without burning my skin. The directions say to use it overnight once or twice a week, which I did initially. I had to start using it every night to see the the progress I wanted. So far so good."
3,Not Bad it Does Exolfiate,"I brought this product for Hyper-pigmentation considering i have Mediterranean skin.i Give this Two rating , 4 stars for a good exfoliation of the skin without a strong glycolic acid base leaving little damage to the skin. 3 Stars however from its lack of affective for hyper pigmentation, so i suggest use a bleaching agent for a month then use this produce in between the bleaching therapy so the bleaching agent can effectively bleach the melanin without dead skin interrupting the process. This product combined with a bleaching agent that does not chemically react to it severely works the best, and i enjoy the direction of being able to sleep with it over night, very comforting and no allergic reaction and no peeling of skin on my figured of frequent use."
2,Flimsy cat furniture,"I bought the Lazy Pet Plush Condo for my three cats - all are between 9 & 13 lbs. The two larger cats could not fit comfortably in this, but none of them were interested anyways. They tried it once or twice and then it sat in the house for months never to be touched again. I gave it to my mom for her cats. Again, they looked at it a few times and lost interest. We finally donated it to charity. Besides the lack of interest from the cats, the design is rather flimsy. I suspect this is why my cats didn't like it. When they tried to sit on top of it, it would shake unsteadily. When they leaned against it to scratch, it wobbled. I think for the money you could find a much better product."
2,Not their fault...,"My cat just doesn't like it, hates the scratching post and he fit in it for about a week when he was a kitten. Everyone needs to know, this is not suitable for an adult cat. maybe a kitten."
3,Easy to build and transport,"If you are looking for an inexpensive way to keep kitty happy while traveling with you, this is it. She will have her own haven that is quickly assembled by rolling the top and bottom of the unit along the velcro binding. Yes, the whole thing is held together by a thick strip of velcro and cardboard. Still, it's not bad for the price and provides a quick hide away for kitty."
5,LOVE THIS STUFF!!!,"All I can say is I LOVE THIS STUFF!! I have been fighting my frizzy curls for YEARS trying EVERYTHING out there to control them, and since I found this I have been literally stocking up on it hoping they do not EVER stop making it...I can FINALLY wear my hair curly and I am loving it! Actually looking forward to seeing how it handles in the humid summer/beach weather this summer:)"
4,Non-christian mommies be aware...,"For you christian mommies, this darling book will melt your heart. As a non-christian, I was disappointed that it was never mentioned in any of the reviews for this sweet book that it was filled with Bible verses and passages. The illustrations are totally precious, I love the ideas offered to inspire you to write your own love letters to your baby, but was utterly put off by the overwhelming christian-ness of this book. If the christian way isn't for you, keep looking for another baby journal."
5,Amazing,"This book is a real tear-jerker. I can only answer a few questions at a time because I inevitably start crying! The questions are very thought provoking and make me very emotional, so I have to put the book away before my tears destroy the pages! It is a beautiful book. I like that it doesn't have spaces for pictures... I will get a different baby book for photos. Highly recommend. This book definitely has a Christian focus, but nothing too disruptive if you aren't religious or Christian."
5,Wonderful!!!,"I bought this book without really knowing what to expect. What a great buy it was. I loved writing in it while I was pregnant and the lead in's gave me just enough to get me started. I am looking forward to presenting this to my son when he is older. Also I love to read it from time to time and recall the emotions and thoughts I had about him, my body and upcoming motherhood. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to be in touch with themselves during pregnancy and give their child a wonderful gift in the future."
3,Brody is great!,"I gave this movie it's 3 stars for actor, Adrien Brody. he is an incredible actor, and very sexy. The story just seems like something i have heard to often before. It was okay, but I just didn't like where the story was going. I would only recommend this if you are a fan of Brody."
1,these controllers sucked,"i brought 2 of these controllers about a week ago, and it just came in yesterday. as i opened one the controllers up the Joystick fell off and there was no way it could of went back on. And as i opened the other controller the joystick was not screwed into the controller so when u use it, you have to make sure it doesnt fall into the controller, the screws just fly around in there..over all this product was a waste of money. it was cheaply made."
5,Excellent product,"Exactly as described, replacement controller for n64. Fast Shipping from the seller. Brand New and Sealed."
3,Good controller with poor joystick.,"I bought this controller particularly because of the super tight joystick which they seem to be bragging about. However, I think the joystick might be a little too tight as my character randomly starts walking around when I'm not even touching the joystick which really makes it difficult when you're aiming at something. I bought four of these and when I received the first one I canceled the other four."
2,Poor control stick at best,"The controller is quite comfortable. Buttons are responsive. However, the control stick is quite stiff and extremely sensitive. It seems to be at maximum sensitivity while barely pushing the stick all the way. This makes playing 1st person shooters EXTREMELY difficult due to the heighten turning. Another problem is that the control stick has a certain springy feel that prevents it from performing precise movements. Overall I was dissatisfied with my purchase."
2,Good premise with poor execution,"""Look"" glimpes several characters in So. Cal thru the eyes of surveilance cameras. We look at cop killers, pedophiles, cheating husbands and wives both gay and straight, and other characters with very little appeal. ""Look"" is ambitious in that it takes on many characters, plots and subplots and attempts to intertwine some of them. The problem is that the characters are just not very likable and that it's hard to care about most of their fates. The film takes a bleak and dark look at its characters and all the negativity and crime isn't much fun to watch. Good movies get the viewer to care about and relate to the people in the film and this is something they have clearly failed with all the seedy characters. 1.5 Stars is all this deserves."
1,"Look, Please Don't","I sat down to watch this film expecting to see a documentary, or quasi-documentary film exploring the nature and long term effects ever intruding surveillance is having on present day society. Instead I found myself subjected to a low budget, unimaginative, voyeuristic, soft core feature reminiscent of what curious teens where attracted to in the seventies. Putting it bluntly 'Look' was nothing short of sophomoric drivel under the guise of meaningful, contemporary commentary. Shame on you! If your taste runs to this kind of infantile titillation you'd be better off picking up one of the 'Girls Gone Wild' films."
3,A novel approach producing mild amusement.,"The acting in this film is quite good, no doubt enhanced by the fact that none of the performers have probably appeared on screen enough to be remembered by viewers. And if the filming was actually completed in just 15 days, as is mentioned in the ""documentary,"" then everyone is to be congratulated (the documentary is often as amusing as the film itself.) If the film comprised actual surveillance footage, the mundane quality of some of the goings-on would be expected. But considering that everything is contrived, the result seems not especially imaginative."
5,what do people do when they aren't being watched?,"a really interesting movie, told through ""surveillance footage"" (the movie was shot on digital, not real surveillance cameras) of different cameras within the same town. at times it was hard to watch- the audience comes to the realization that people do horrible things when they don't think they are being watched. it is unsettling and affecting, and shows the darker underbelly of what being a human being means."
1,Terrible Just Terrible,"This movie, is the worst movie I have seen in years. The reason this movie is terrible. Is becuase, of the cheap film quality. Also, their is no explanation of the different characters in different scenes of the movie. All you see is how people get mad at ATM machines, steal from stores, get into car wrecks and hit and run, act unprofessional at work and so on. After twenty minutes, I had enough of this movie and turned it off."
4,it was cool,"While I'm not familiar with any of the actors/actresses in the movie. I find that to be a good thing sometimes.Look...It's a different way of filming and looking at things. As the movie progresses through the eyes several different characters throughout. Yes, this style has been done before but with ""Look"". It seems a bit different and adds a bit to the movie as a whole. I would recommend it to fans of this style of movie. If nothing else give it a chance via renting and then form a different opinion of this yourself."
1,Does not run,This DVD does not run on my Sony PS3. I put it in my computer and the video runs without any sound.
1,shocking to say the least,this movie was a little too horrific for my taste. I'll be honest and say that after about 10 minutes i shut it off. depending on your taste you may have a different opinion
5,Exceptionally Good,"A veritable slice of Americana--at times hilarious, ominous, depressing and exuberant. Covers a wide range of topics and characters exceptionally well in a dramatic and believable fashion. Yes, the sexual content is raunchy but somehow seems true to life. You won't be disappointed."
3,Someone's Watching You,"I applaud the filmmakers for piecing together several stories in an innovative approach, sort of a play on reality tv via surveillance cameras that are so much a part of our everyday lives that we tend to ignore them.This makes you think about what is being captured, who's watching, and what's unfolding before the camera everyday.Throw in some compelling contemporary vignettes woven together by the eye the camera, and you get some insightful commentary on modern society and its tragedies.Fresh storytelling worth a watch."
1,Inconsistent Qualities That Say Amateur,"This film attempted to portray human weaknesses and deviances which were supposed to have been filmed over remote security cameras that exist in our society. The film did portray the human weaknesses but did not consistently display the remote video security camera point of view. And, the audio quality, while not great, was too good to match the capture of the the inconsistent video quality of the film. I did not find anything about ""Look"" that made it exceptional in any way other than it was somewhat different in style. I could only recommennd this film to those who were starting a career in film and would need an example of what not to do in a secuity camera mode of telling their story, or portion thereof. For others, I would say forget it, not worth the money."
2,Great idea -- Poor execution,Let's face it -- If a movie starts out with two naked coeds examining each others private parts in a changing room then any hope of reality just left the building. The ides is good but the scenes are clearly staged and not actual surveillance footage. That alone destroyed any hopes I had for this movie. I wanted the raw unedited REAL footage but was seriously disapointed. Taxicab Confessions is like Gone with the Wind compared to Look.
2,LOOK is not what I expected!,"This video documentary has some interesting points, but its production values are poor and amateurish. I found it difficult to finish watching the documentary, simply because it didn't hold my interest. I admit am not a documentary fan, but with all due respect to the production team, this one just didn't hit the spot for me."
2,GREAT IDEA GONE WRONG!,"I had high hopes for this film, but the lack of originality and substance really disappointed me. I understand the concept, but really, I'm tired of this ""reality footage"" garbage! The surveillance camera gimmick is irritating enough, but the acting ranges from horrible to tolerable. I would much rather be watching 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Crash', which used a similar idea of weaving 5 stories together!...at least they were extremely entertaining."
3,You are being watched,"When I first glanced at the description of this film I thought it was going to comprised of real footage strung together to make a story, but it's all fake. I would have prefered the real footage angle, but it's still an interesting idea.LOOK is shot unlike any movie I've ever seen. By using only security cameras you know it took a lot of work to make these various stories work and connect in a cinematic fashion. The acting is at times believable and at others the performances will remind you that you are just watching a movie.Overall, LOOK is worth viewing once if for no other reason than to show just how much Big Brother is really watching us everyday. I learned listening to the commentary that about half of the states in the U.S. allow bathroom and dressing room cameras by law. That is just so freaking wrong."
1,boring and bland,"i was so dissapointed in this books content. instead of amazing work, i mostly saw women trying to hard to be edgy, or ok with nudes. boring, bland, and overreaching. thumbs down."
4,Good set,"this isn't His full Hits but nevertheless there are Good cuts here.""I Wish he didn't trust me so much"" is the cut. Bobby womack is a Very Good Musician&Songwriter. His voice just always cuts to the Chase.a very detailed&straight forward Artist."
2,Not detailed enough,"It only show a cursory glance at TP and referred pain patterns. Good to show patients an overview, but not detailed enough to really help everyone."
2,"A mechanical, uneventful book","This one felt like it was churned out in some machine in 20 minutes. The plot was fairly insane in the premise. Yes I know it could happen, but this felt like a cheesy 1970's Bond film where the one dimensional villain sits in his mansion with underground lairs plotting world destruction.I like the main character, he's funny and a cynic, but overall this was a lame book. Demille has some excellent books, this is not one of them."
3,Big Disappointment,"I love Nelson DeMille and I anxiously wait for each new book. But Wild Fire disappointed me so much that I don't recommend it even to the most ardent fans. It was too formalaic, too predictable and I didn't think the subject matter was that interesting. He bored you to death with details on the scientific aspects. Too much research, I think. And did anyone notice that almost every character in the book ended sentences with ""and so forth."" Drove me nuts.However, having said all that, I look forward to the next book."
2,Difficult to read,"I have read many of Mr. DeMille's books but this one is by far the worst. The first 100 pages seemed forced and didn't really seem to work for me. The main character was good but a little tired and overdone. Try one of the earlier books, Plum Island or Word of Honor."
1,barely worth it as a 'plane book',"Loved his earlier stuff and Gold Coast was a favorite. This is idiotic with a ridiculous plot. He should stop trying to write female characters as they are male with breasts. The ""witty dialogue"" is very very old and hackney.He's obviously just fulfilling contract requirements to get a paycheck. He needs to take a cue from Scott Turow and just write when he actually has a worthwhile plot. He once was a good read.Another one for the circular file...yawn............"
1,I can't imagine anyone would willingly listen to Scott Brick,"Nelson DeMille cranks out another dime a dozen pop fiction bestseller a la James Patterson or Michael Connelley, an average book to fill mindless time if you don't mind your literature with the subtlety of a shotgun and the artistry of a shovel. A great book for the 81% of the %90 of people who mistakenly believe they are in the top %10 percent in any given admirable quality, i.e. driving ability, intelligence, etc."
4,Love the way Demille writes....,"This is fun, fast paced, scary, could be true.....I would love to discuss, but don't want to give anything away. Nelson Demille is the best at developing a characters personality....."
3,Terrible Plot but well written,"The plot is just awful. If I say any more I would just be babbling about nonsensical political biases. As bad as the plot is, the author does write a good story. The characters are interesting, however they are implausible. Strangely enough I do not believe that all FBI agents are incompetent, and all NY Homicide Detectives are both rebellous and brillant. I have read most of Neslon DeMille's books and this rates as his worst."
5,superb description,"All the stuff about ELF was absolutely fascinating and written so well that I could understand it though have limited math and science interest.Thanks again for a great read, Jean Thibault Castagno suthor The Kids and GrampaT"
2,Disappointment,"Although I am a huge fan of Mr. Demille I found this novel very disappointing. He had a good story line, could have gone farther with it, but fell short. Perhaps Mr. Demille selected the wrong ""hero"" character for this novel, rather than John Corey he sould have assigned this case to Paul Bremmer. I read the book cover-to-cover but not with the passion I have read others written by this author. Hope the next novel meets the author's higher standards"
2,Disappointing Sequel,"Nelson DeMille has written some of the best thrillers around - books such as The Gold Coast, The General's Daughter, Word of Honor and others which are engrossing and authoritative in their plots, character development and expression of the sociological contexts in which they occur.This is DeMille's fourth John Corey novel and it is a lame effort. Particularly if you are a fan of his older works, you will enjoy this stale, formulaic sequel about as much as you might enjoy Rocky or Lassie Part 4. The plot of this book is unoriginal and predictable, and the sophomoric mentality and humor of Mr. Corey - which were amusing for the first book or two, long ago became tiresome."
3,"Talk, talk, talk","If you prefer banter to action, this is for you. Our hero can't shut up. It annoys to the point of pain."
1,Fire isout!,"As a long-term DeMille fan I was extremely disappointed in Wild Fire. He takes witty banter between John Corey and his wife to the extreme. It was like reading a script from the old Avenger TV series with the endless witty banter between Mrs. Poole and Patric McCoogan. Tally-ho! On to the bad guys! A little of that goes a loooong way. I pitched the book about 1/3 the way through, before I started gagging. DeMille needs to get away from writing comedy and get back to his serious roots. Before purchasing any future DeMille books I will be waiting for the reviews!"
1,Endless wisecracking and bantering,"I have read all of DeMille's books, and this was my least favorite. Despite the premise, not an awful lot actually happens. Much of the book is spent with John Corey, whose endless wisecracking and bantering ultimately becomes annoying. There are pages and pages of tedious dialogue between Corey and his wife - back-and-forth, with Corey making snide remarks and his poor wife telling him to behave. Enough, please! This guy is a jerk.As for the overall premise/plot, it's not bad (and rather scary), but by the end Bain Madox has become a caricature of one of those silly James Bondian end-of-the-world villains.Very disappointing."
1,What has happened to DeMille?,"This is not the usual DeMille - here he has written a ridiculous plot and silly, trite dialogue. Very, very disappointing!"
3,I lost interest in it,"Half way though I lost interest, and never finished it. The other John Corey books were better. They kept my interest."
1,bo-o-o-r-r-r-ing and childish,"This was the first DeMille book I've read, or attempted to read. A coworker of mine is an avid reader of his work, and highly recommended all of DeMille's books. He lent me Wildfire, and I eagerly anticipated an exciting yarn. However, I only managed to slog through the first 90-100 pages before I literally couldn't take it anymore. The dialog basically consists of incessant four-letter-word laden insults/wisecracks after another, and that soon became too much for me. I've read countless novels featuring grizzled veteran detectives, but both John and Harry are insufferable. Add to that the volley of political remarks of the so-called 'heroes' made it even more annoying. So annoying that I immediately found myself rooting for the alleged 'villain' throughout the portion that I read. Perhaps I will try another DeMille book, but not one of the John Corey series. This one will be buried."
5,I just love the cynical character of J. Corey,"I loved the book. DeMille is one of the few writers, with such great sense of humor. He knows how to build a good character. When reading out door, people probably saw me smile a lot. The story may be a little imaginary , but who cares as long as you enjoy the main hero.Looking forward to another story of Corey , probably on 2011 or 2012."
3,"Good, but the light bulb goes on a little too easily","I liked this book, and I usually chuckled at most of John Corey's wisecracks, though I can see how their frequency can annoy some readers. (As far as that goes, you're either endeared to the Corey character or you're not. My advice is to just roll your eyes, like Kate, and get on with the rest of the book!) Anyway, my only criticism of the book is that I felt the lightbulb over John's head went on a little to easily and a little too suddenly. The story seemed to go from John and Kate not getting it to suddenly figuring out the general idea (though not all its specifics) of the dastardly scheme, almost out of nowhere. I would have liked a little more development on that score. Otherwise, on balance, I enjoyed the book."
1,Really Bad DeMille,"By the middle of this book, I wanted to kill John Corey. All the stupid exchanges with his wife/partner got a little old. It is time for this character to go away. Completely implausible. In fact I was wondering when the wife was going to kill him in his sleep. I liked DeMille's earlier work. I liked Lion, Spencerville and General's Daughter.It is sad when an author is turning this garbage out for the cash. Check th Stuart Woods club on disposable characters."
1,Terrible Book,"Wow, what a loser this book is. First of all, the premise is preposterous and insulting to the reader. Secondly, like other reviewers here have noted, the narrator has an attitude which fast becomes old. And thirdly, well, I don't know because I quit reading around page 100. I can put credulity on hold in the interest of losing myself in a good novel but, come on, the premise of this book is simply not credible. DeMille is capable of writing a good book but this one is so bad I might just quit reading him."
4,Good Book,"I love Nelson DeMille. He tells a great story. This one could have been better if he had just held back on the ""Husband Wife"" banter.Sure he is a maverick but we know that without (the characters) having a detail analysis. You tend to skim this book, not read it in an heavy way.I like most of his books and I liked this one.Not as exciting as the rest."
2,Goes On and On!,"This is an irritating read! The book runs on for 40 of it's 52 chapters and embarrasses itself at the end. Yes...read the jacket and spare yourself the relentless adjectives and adverbs discribing the exact same things! This is the first DeMille book I've read and if he talks like he writes, I'd be asking him...""get to your point already!"""
1,A Fallen Star,"I always read the customer reviews before I read a book. The earlier reviews of Wild Fire were good. I then spent about a week reading it and could not figure out if I was out of touch. I see the later reviews, which were negative, are right on point. This book was not up to DeMille's standards I even got tired of Corey's wisecrackingThe premise made no sense. The middle of the book was endless. The end was predictable and the only interesting question in my mind in the whole book was not answered.My recommendation is to read or reread an earlier effort.One of the reviewers said DeMille said this is his last book under this contract. I only hope the next effort will show a fresh start."
1,Thanks for the heads up! I just saved time and $.,"I just returned from Nepal and was aware that Wild Fire would be released while I was away. I can't say that I'm surprised that most knowledgeable DeMille fans feel let down. A year ago, on his website, DeMille comments that Wild Fire (at the time unnamed) will be the last book in his contract and that if he ever writes another, it will be on his timetable and not his publishers.Give us an honest effort and we'll excuse a book that doesn't meet expectations, but take advantage, and ..... lets just say they're a lot of choices out there."
1,A Waste of Time and a Real Disappointment,"When I realized early on the time I would waste on this assemblage of leftover quips packaged around a absurd concept, I resolved that I would alert other readers.Generally I enjoy this author's works and anticipated this latest tome. I was surprised and dissappointed to find a lengthy novel which did nothing to disguise it's clues or probable developments. Everything was telegraphed and nothing was original. The conclusion was so lame that I was shocked that there was no effort to build suspense or intrigue.My advice is to skip this one and wait for the reviews on his next."
1,"I have not yet received this book, and it's been more than a month since I ordered it.","I have not yet received this book, more than a month after I placed the order. I am not very satisfied, to say the least!"
1,Major Disappointment......,"I had preordered this book and was very much looking forward to reading it. I'd read 4 other of DeMille's books and enjoyed them immensely. What a let down this book is. It's just way too cute and flippant while at the same time raising the specter of the greatest threat this country has ever known. The protagonist characters are completely unbelievable in their actions given the stakes of a suitcase nuclear devise being detonated in a U.S. city. It's not a graveyard or pointed type of humor that permeates the book, it's rather sophomoric and shallow and not even very funny. I kept waiting for the author to get serious and ratchet it up but it ends in a predictable, typical shoot out. Save your money (and time). This is a total waste."
3,what happened??,"I have really enjoyed every book I've read by Nelson Demille, and even Wild Fire was readable. But I was pretty disappointed by it, it had none of the thought and details that he has put in his other books. For such a complicated evil plot, Corey and his wife wrapped it up in no time, which left the rest of the book to wise cracks and inane dialog. So what I'm doing now is rereading The Charm School, which is a prime example of the talented writing that Demille is capable of."
4,John Corey is great but the story is a bit odd,"It is a very entertaining book due to the character of John Corey, and I did really enjoy it. The story was a bit goofy. This book definitely takes things to the edge of believability."
1,Awful!,"The only reason I finished this book was loyalty to my all-time favorite author, Nelson DeMille. Smart a** John Corey continues to be the disappointing main character he was in Plum Island and Night Fall. The book is mostly dialog with a minimum of action. Why does DeMille have his characters talk their situation to death? I was bored stiff by page 100! Could hardly wait to finish! Where is the meat of The General's Daughter and Gold Coast? I will skip the next John Corey adventure while still hoping for the old DeMille in a sequel to Gold Coast."
1,Disappointing,"I have read just a few DeMille books and prefer other authors and this book definitely justified why for me. The main character John Corey seems like a real jerk and was hard for me to root for him at all. He has a smart mouth and is incredibly cocky and has to make a wisecrack to everyone he comes across. The first part of the book when he was not involved was fairly interesting as the plot by the bad guy Madox was laid out, but once harry muller was killed and the story went back to Corey and his wife it really bogged down for me. The ending was nothing spectacular as was wrapped up far too quickly in my opinion."
2,No Improvement,"I have read most of DeMille novels. The early ones: Plum Island, the Gold Coast, the General's Daughter, and later, the Lion's Game, to mention a few, were all terrific and rated at least 4 stars. His later novels have really been disappointing.While John Corey is a real likeable character, DeMille, in this novel, stretches the limits of one's patience. Even the story line here is not very original. At over 400 pages long, this novel could easily have been condensed into a good short story, say 50-75 pages. The huge amount of useless dialague and descriptive material in this novel is just a waste of time and is to be skimmed over. How any one could rate it a 4 or 5 star, is really beyond me."
3,A Good Read,"Dialogue was a little over the top. In all her other appearances, Kate Mayfield never had as bad a vocabulary as she did in this one. DeMille seemed to be trying to drop enough F-bombs to rival Tony Montana. Looking foward to his next one which is a sequel to Gold Coast."
5,A Great Read,"I am a fan of Nelson Demille and have read most of his books. I have read a few of the reviews other people have written and wondered if we read the same book. It is not important to me if the plot is feasible, I just thought it was a great read."
2,Not much to recommend,"I run hot and cold with this author. He is very funny when he's got his main character wisecracking about other people. For this reason I really liked The Gold Coast and Plum Island. But I had to put this one down after several chapters that alternate between men sitting in a room expounding their silly theories, and the protagonist spending time with his girlfriend. I guess, and I'm truly guessing here, that the silly theories are meant to be so terrifying that it would create drama just to have people talk about them. Wrong. I would have given it one star based on that, but I credited him an extra star because he can put a sentence together well. I recommend you avoid this one."
4,My first DeMille read...excellent,"I have to admit I usually shy away from longer books, I don't have tons of time to read so I stick to a quick Koontz or Saul novel usually, but I was glad I picked this one up.If you like conspiracy theories,mystery, crime, then this is for you. A remote cabin in upstate New York is under surveillance by a member of an Anti-Terrorist Task Force and he goes missing. His friend and co-worker John Corey takes it upon himself to get to the bottom of it. With his wife who is in the FBI they encounter Bain Maddox, the owner of the cabin, who with help of the govt. is putting together a plan to destroy the middle east.The first 130 pages mostly take place in this cabin and gives a lot of unnecessary information, I always think it's better to learn the plot as the detective does (like in Koontz novels). Once you get past that tho, the other 600 pages fly right by. I highly recommend this to anyone who thinks the government is up to something."
2,YAWN,"I've read to date The General's Daughter, The Lion's Game, Up Country, Plum Island and Nightfall. By far, the best book is The Lion's Game. Demille is a great writer. You understand this when you read someone like Vince Flynn. Yet Wildfire was a disappointment.I will say that this is the first book I've listened to on CD read by an actor. Maybe that was why I didn't like it as much. It seemed so tedious. The action and suspense was almost absent entirely. I think John Corey needs to go away.The Lion's Game needs to be a movie and done much better than The General's Daughter. That movie was painful to watch after reading the book."
2,Just Okay,"I have read most of DeMille's books over the years and this one was not a page turner like others; i.e. Gold Coast, Cathedral, Lions Game. The plot was average and the book relies a lot on Corey's wit. However, I just finally read ""Word of Honor"" and it is a great book if not one of his best. I hope DeMille is not getting burned out like some of my other favorite authors."
5,Wild Fire,Like all Demille books I found this to be a page turner. Couldn't wait to pick it back up the next day. Love the John Corey stories.
5,avid reader,"John Corey is my favorite detective- what a sense of humor Mr. DeMille has- even in the most awful moments, I find myself laughing. Look forward to more stories."
4,John corey My old friend,"Reading John Corey, is like a visit from an old friend.This time, JC is up to his neck in sarcasm and not following the rules out in the woods of New York. It was a very sinister notion that the evil doers are trying to launch a nuclear missile using the extremely low frequencies.It was a far off old school Cold War Notion. DeMille really brought it all to life.I enjoyed it. Can't wait to see the next adventure of John Corey"
3,John Corey's getting out of control,"I have read all of DeMille's John Corey books -- in order. I just finished Wild Fire.I think the Corey character is getting out of control. The traits that made him an interesting figure in earlier books -- the bravado, the irreverence, the sharp edged humor -- are now creeping toward parody. It reminds me of what happened to the James Bond movie character -- he evolved from dramatic to melodramatic to comic book. Hope that doesn't happen here."
3,not up to speed,"Maybe my expectations are too high based on his other novels. The story line base is interesting but toward the end it was a little too fantasy, unrealistic. Read it but borrow it or get it on sale."
1,Awful book!!!,"This book was farfetched and far below my expectations for DeMille. My husband called it ""God Awful""."
2,Disappointing,"I think I've read all Mr. Demille's previous books and have enjoyed all, the plot of Wildfire is very provocative and interesting, but the husband/wife crime busters and their tortured dialog have the feel of a script for Hart to Hart or maybe a later days Thin Man."
1,You call this a thriller!?,"This was probably the cheapest, weakest, most pathetic attempt at a thriller I've run across, and I wouldn't be surprised if DeMille just dashed this off simply to earn a paycheck. Some demented right-winger decides he's going to decisively win the War On Terror back during the pre-game hysteria for Iraq by framing Islam for his own nuking of LA and San Francisco, which will also somehow help the nation ""regain lost honor"" by scaring the Vietnamese government into surrendering to us, and our alleged hero John Corey and his wife are too busy having a romantic working weekend in Long Island to notice. The villain practically advertises his intentions to Corey at every possible turn, but Corey would rather complain about France's refusal to join the Coalition Of The Willing to notice. Don't just save your money, save your time and leave this on the shelf in the library rather than reading it."
3,Fun but DeMille can do so much better,"This was a fun book, but I think Nelson DeMille should exercise his skills on different characters and plots for a change. John Corey is getting a bit tired; give him - and us - a break and bring back some of the brilliance and power demonstrated in so many other great novels (Charm School, Rivers of Babylon, The Gold Coast, . . . among many)."
2,not this time,"I really wanted to like this book, but it was actually annoying. I really liked John Corey in Plum Island, less so in the Lion's Game, and hated him in Wildfire. the wisecracking was way over the top, and his wife came off as a lame straightman/sidekick.I hope Mr. Demille doesnt do this in the sequel to his greatest work: The Gold Coast. That was the first book I read by him- luckily it wasnt this one!"
1,Unreadable Claptrap,I just started this book this afternoon. I have been a big fan of DeMilles especially Night Fall which took an actual event and wove a compelling story line that makes sense.Wildfire makes no sense at all. We are not fighting other countries but indiviuals in the current confrontation with Islamic extremists. Kill half the militants in the world and you will still have to deal with individuals who live in Cleveland or Manchester.I'm moving on to some better reading like the new Joseph Wambaugh and dumping this turkey before I waste anymore time.
1,not worth the calories to lift it,"DeMille should hang his head in shame.I suggest he either retire or give his next book a whole lot of though.Actually,the premise of this book is very possible whomever holds the button.BUT.I first take exception to the simplistic cliche that is the villian.ho hum.Read that a thousand times.Boring boring boring.Second,these people are nitwits.A plot this big would have a well rehearsed scenario.Third,the husband and wife team dialogue.Well,that was when I put the book down.I doubt I'll finish it.I don't care what happens though I am sure I know.Read that before in another book.save your money."
3,Plot is ridiculous.,"I know there are crazy right wingers. I know some of them are powerful. And maybe it's not the plot that's ridiculous, maybe it's the characters. Not sure. But this felt like reading a comic book."
3,Sickening Humor,"This is my fourth in this series and Corey's sense of humor is really getting on my nerves and detracts from the story line, so much, in fact, that I doubt I will even finish this one, much less read another one. Noone in real life is this bad!The story is believable, as are all in this series, thus the modest rating, but the humor is much worse even than some of the things Robert Parker writes for 'Spenser' to say in the Spenser for Hire series."
3,C+ for DeMille,"I enjoyed the book, although it is nowhere near his best work. John Corey as the wisecracking hero is getting a bit old. DeMille seems to be straining at this point to give his main character clever things to say. On the whole, it is a fast-paced and entertaining read, but it falls well short of the standard he set with Gold Coast, Plum Island, etc. I have not read any other customer reviews so I really don't know how the rest of the DeMille fans feel about this one. As soon as I post this I guess I'll know."
2,good plot but horrible writing,"Although Nelson DeMille can be an excellent writer, this book which has a provocative plot should have been substantially edited by DeMille or his publisher. The continual wisecracking and sophomoric antics of the main character John Corey detract from the plot, not to mention the fact that the reader can hardly imagine someone like Corey employed in a responsible position within the framework of law enforcement. Editing of Corey's continual wisecracking would have shortened the book substantially and allowed for a quality final product. Although DeMille employed Corey's character in Nighfall, his previous book, in the latter book (which is vastly superior to Wildfire) DeMille exerted reasonable control over Corey's antics and wisecracking."
3,Really Mediocre Read,"What can you say about such a professional writer as Nelson DeMille? That he's inventive, that he's imaginative, and now with Wild Fire, you can say that he's gone to the well one too many times. I used to really admire DeMille's writing because for the longest time he didn't renew any of his characters. You read them and then lamented their demise. But what is this, Corey's fifth book? What's new in this one? Nothing. Same John Corey, wise cracking problem solver extrodanaire, simultaneously being chased by the good guys and the bad guys and setting his own rules throughout. But what's bad about Wild Fire is that Corey's not in it for the first 100 pages or so. There's a different character who you don't need to invest in because you just know he won't survive to page 150. There are better books on the market; there are better books by DeMille. Still, even a mediocre DeMille book is better than half of what's out there."
2,This one wasn't so good.,"So much waste of space. Maybe at 250 pages or so it woud have been okay. The story was good but he dragged it out. Why? I can appreciate imagery but there wasn't any to speak of. Sorry, Nelson, can't get excited about this one."
4,Good series,I am reading the whole series but I did enjoy this one book more than some of the others. Intriguing/scarey plot especially in this post 9/11 world.
2,Underwhelming,"I'm a huge DeMille fan - but Wild Fire fails on many levels.Let's start with the total implausibility of the plot.DeMille says such a plan as Wild Fire probably exists - but the book fails to make me a believer.Let's continue with the sheer stupidity of the main characters, whom you are supposed to respect for brazenly rushing into danger, rather than following protocol, and with total disrespect for their adversaries AND their collegues.But I can live with all that.It's just that the book starts weakly, with no real suspense or drama, and goes downhill from there.The last straw - for the main bad guy to explain to the people who he knows are trying to foil his plans, exactly what his plans are, and how they can indeed foil them; to lead them around at gunpoint instead of just simply blowing them away - well, I guess he never saw a James Bond movie or an episode of Get Smart.Sheer stupidity.Sorry Nelson - I love your other work."
4,Solid Writing,This book will keep you on the edge of your chair. Excellent writing and very solid storytelling.
2,So very disappointing!,"This book has about 3 interesting chapters; the rest is all dialog between a man and wife. All this chit chat does nothing to further the plot, but simply takes up time and space. There is no suspense until the 49th chapter. Take my word for it; this book is not worth the $$, or time to read. What a waste of talent."
2,Disappointing,"This is the latest of the John Corey series, and the worst! The author Has Corey sounding like a bad stand up comic with too many wise cracks at the wrong times."
3,Really a 2.5...,"This book is nothing special. If you're a fan of DeMille it's adequate just don't expect anything like The Charm School, The Gold Coast or Up Country. Three of my favorite books. Possible spoilers: I was bugged about the third person sections that seemed jammed in the novel. I'm guessing there was some tough decision making on whether or not to include it. I would have rather it been left out. Granted that would have changed a lot in the book but I think it would have been better for it. My other peeve was the Ted Nash character. The Corey/Nash conflict has arguably been the highlight of The Lion's Game and Night Fall. He brought him back, fine, but he popped in the story and popped back out just as quick. Decent entertainment read, it's worth the $15 for a DeMille fan otherwise wait to pick it up in paperback at the airport."
5,Wild Fire,"This book is excellent, it keeps you interested page after page. I couldn't put it down. I love John Corey and Kate! What an awesome read."
3,Character,The story is fine and would have rated a higher score. Cory is wearing me out. With each book he saracasm increases and in this book is intolerable. Tone done the rhetoric and concentrate on the story
2,not up to Demille's usual standards,"What happened? DeMille usually produces a thick meaty thought-provoking enjoyable thriller. The problem here is too much silliness. Hero John Corey is constantly making silly comments about bears, and the non-stop sarcasm and other ""humor"" is jarring, distracting, and off-putting. In addition, the way Corey deals with his superiors is so unbelievable and unrealistic as to further detract from the plot. If this is your first Demille, don't give up. His other books are excellent."
4,Real good read...,"I love Demille. He's my favorite author and this is a very good book. It's NOT as good as his earlier books - Cathedral, Mayday of charm School, but it is well worth the time."
4,A Real Page Turner,"As one of the featured reviewers points out, DeMille writes two kinds of books--suspense thrillers and excellent literature. ""Wild Fire"" is in the first group. It is a class A page turning suspense thriller that is almost impossible to put down.This book is part ""Dr. Strangelove,"" part ""Fail Safe"" and part James Bond all rolled together and updated for the 21st century. It also has elements of television's ""24."" A group of powerful, far right Viet Nam veterans seeks to end global terrorism by extraordinatry means. The rest is for the reader to find out for himself.""Wild Fire"" does not have the literary or informational depth of ""The Gold Coast"" or ""Up Country,"" but it does have some factual information and a couple of interesting ideas for the reader to chew on. As for readability and excitement, it is right up there with ""The Lion's Game.""I recommend this book highly for readers who like action and suspense."
2,Disappointing,I have been a DeMille fan for years--but this book was a major disappointment. The plot was a stretch and the dialogue ridiculous. How many times does an author have to use F#$% You? The stupid wisecracks and sarcasm of John Corey are pathetic. Go back and re-read Charm School or one of his earlier books--pass on this one!
3,"John Corey is still great, but the story is lacking.","I really hope DeMille keeps going with the John Corey character, but this book suggests that he's really struggling with where to take him. As previous reviewers have noted, the story starts out very fast and there seems to be a lot of potential. However, the rest of the story is unrealistic, predictable, and pretty boring at times, which is pretty rare for a Nelson DeMille book. If it wasn't for the John Corey character (who continues to be VERY entertaining), I probably would have stopped reading the book at about 100 pages."
4,DeMille just keeps writing'em good!,"I get Nelson DeMille on Audio and listen to a chapter or two each night. If you get DeMille you'll never be dissapointed - everytime I start to nod off he hits me with a line or two that makes me either start laughing out loud or sets the mind in motion to a point where I'm wide awake. Nelson can plant his shoes under my bed anytime he wants (literarily, or course). bg"
2,Could barely choke it down,"At times dull and slow moving, at times irritating and unrealistic, this story was a disappointment. Is it just a coincidence that the villain is a conservative, decorated Vietnam war hero? Who also happens to be a wealthy oil tycoon? And the book's hero is a wise-ass, smart mouth, rude, obnoxious cop whose own (FBI agent) wife can barely tolerate him at times. We are supposed to believe that a group of rich, powerful ""right wing loons"" are about to perpetrate global nuclear Armageddon, with the government's blessing... because rich, powerful, right wing loons have nothing better to live for. This truly is fiction. Which is fine, as long as no one tries to pass it off as plausible. I get the sense that DeMille has issues with conservatives and the military."
2,Doesn't Work,"I have read most of this author's books and enjoyed them all, until this one. I tossed it aside after the first hundred or so pages. The main character is unlikeable and the plot is out in left field (or actually more like right field)."
2,"A quick, but sophomoric read",I really like Nelson Demille's older works such as Cathedral and the Generals Daughter. I don't like the John Corey character and especially the banter that he uses when speaking with other characters. I hated Night Fall and I hated this one.
3,"Lacks the ""Punch"" You Will Hope For.","This was an okay book. It had some intriguing thought processes behind the fiction, but considering the author can write a 500+ page book, I would have expected more creativity. The plot? Ok. The details? Ok. If it were half as long or twice as ingenious, I would have felt it was worth it.***** THE BOTTOM LINE *****- It was entertaining to read, but lacked a great ""kick"".- It is worth purchasing, but only as a backup to other books you may be wanting more."
5,Genius!,DeMille has never written a book I didn't like. His grasp of the political and social scene is uncanny. He's quick witted and his books always have snappy dialogue. One of my favorite authors.
1,What a Disappointment!,"Yikes! Maybe DeMille needs a rest. This one is so far below his usual standard I couldn't believe it. Right off the bat the bad guys tell all their plans to one of the cops... just showing off I guess, but far from credible. Surely the DeMille of old could have found a better device to let us in on the plot. Also, the author acknowledges that some of his law-enforcement readers thought his hero (Corey) plays too fast and loose with the rules. He should have listened to them. Corey becomes ridiculous.And, instead of dialog, the non-stop wisecracking is tiresome. It feels like we're supposed to judge a one-liner contest between DeMille and Robert Parker.Will the real Nelson DeMille please come back!"
2,I so wanted this to be good,"I am a big fan of Mr. Demille, but this novel was so sloppily constructed and executed I was embarsassed for the Author. This novel has such an absurd story line. I will not say what it is, but the all to lazy way of having the victim seated, hearing the entire plane of the master minds knowing he will die once it is finally told harkens to a Scoody Doo cartoon. I do love Demille, and I think he should continue A Lion's Game shouldbe the way to go. If you are bored and like the familiar taste and feel of Demille by all means go for it. I heard this was a bummer of a book, but I still love his writing."
3,John Corey's Attitude Wears Thin,"I've begun to notice that John Corey seems incapable of actual dialogue in DeMille's last couple of books. Every conversation seems to consist of him coming off with some smart-a$$ comment that really begins to annoy. The story in this book is half decent, it's a shame that DeMille couldn't come up with better dialogue with which to fill out the periphery."
3,Wildfire,"I was very disappointed in this latest De Mille book. The first third was quite interesting, building characters and fleshing out the story. About half way through it seemed to bog down in minutia and became very tedious. I did not bother to finish it nor did my husband. Sorry too many other good reads on the horizon."
3,Time to put a fork in Corey,"I am a huge DeMille fan, but Wild Fire was a disappointment. The main problem is that all the characters were completely unbelieveable. First, the antagonist is too loony to lead me to believe anyone would follow his lead- especially the type of high ranking people that were involved. Next- Corey- for the first time, I as the reader began to think he was slightly unlikeable. And its not just the wise-cracking which other readers have noted. The way this guy acts, you sort of want to punch him. Kate was completely useless in this story. And don't even get me started on the constant Ted Nash references. It may be time to start a new character and plot line."
3,"Not bad, but not great","I didn't mind this book.The main character could have been very irritating to read, however I've personally worked with some police officers that have had a quite similar attitude to Mr Corey. In reality, they wouldnt keep their job nowadays, however.The plot is fairly undemanding to follow but interesting enough. The book itself could have benefited from perhaps being a little more fast paced. There are pages and pages of dialogue that is sort of amusing, but doesnt really move the story forward much.3 stars."
3,I am sick of John Corey,"I have read about a dozen Nelson DeMille books and have enjoyed them all to one degree or another. This book has John Corey in it again and every time Corey appears in a book his dialog becomes cuter and cuter with so many wise cracks it is totally distracting from the story line. The story line in this book is actually quite good but each page has as least 2 if not more idiotic wise cracks by the Corey character. I have more Nelson DeMille books on my future reading list but I am going to check to see if John Corey is in there. If he is, I am going to read something else. I have had it!"
3,Typical,WILD FIRE was typical and predictable in plot for Nelson DeMille. Story's setting was interesting with our country's current events.
2,Not up to par,"I've read all the DeMille books. This is by far the worst. Tedium, routine plot, routine action. Smart arse remarks by the hero constantly distracts from the story line. Want to read an even better plot along the same lines: ""Seven Days in May."" Now that was a classic. The DeMille books up to this one have been at least 4 stars. Maybe he was behind his deadline when he came up with this one. Let's see what the next one will bring."
2,Read the Jacket So You Don't Have to Buy the Book,"If you read the jacket of the book you know most of what is going to happen in the story. If you have read other Nelson DeMille stories, you know that John Corey is not going to die. There's plenty of wise guy remarks and humor in this tale. Basically the story tells how John Corey and his wife discover the sinster plot that you already have been told in the jacket of the book and in the beginning of the story. Nelson DeMille is starting to resemble James Patterson. That's no compliment."
2,Don't waste your money,"DeMille has done a rotten job with this book. Aspects of the plot(which isn't too bad) are never resolved. If you must read this badly written book, wait until it goes on sale."
2,weak,"It has some entertaining value, but it is very close to an absolute loss.1. The investigative part of the two day story is very thin.2. 80% of the book is an unnecessary detailed description of the great John-Corey-against-the-world pissing marathon.3. The tense final standoff is very artificially constructed from unmotivated actions taken by all sides.4. The pretense is kooky beyond all borders of reasonable: we all know that to incinerate the Muslim World all we have to do is to stop propping it up and it will incinerate itself; there is no need to use nukes for the purpose.5. CIA participation line is even kookier, can you believe that george tenets and valery plames of this world would ever participate in nuclear terrorism conspiracy?6. I am tired of yet another millionaire cop constantly complaining about ""the rich""."
2,His Worst,"I like Demille's work and looked forward to this one. I can only think it is the result of a contractual obligation. A plot not even ""24"" would try. Tedious. Massive amounts of irrelevant chit-chat and scenes."
1,What a waste of paper!,"The story is lame, poorly researched and badly told. The characters?! OMG! The only good and well thought sentence in the whole book is when the FBI agent tells her husband: ""Evolution and natural selection should have taken care of people like you"". People like that exist but they are usually part of a gang and they die early (natural selection). They are certainly not performing tasks where they have to show any level of responsibility. We all know that the public servants that populate the ranks of the FBI, Police Departments and others may not be always ""the best of the best"" as they like to call themselves simply because they are human like everybody else. But this book is an insult to these people from whom our safety and future depends. I hope that Nelson DeMille retires very soon because, if not, we may still have the privilege to read in his next book how ""Bubba the Pimp"" his running the show at the Pentagon..."
5,A Must Have Book for Religious Fanatics,"This book was very scripturally informative. I recommend every bible-thumping...""loves me some white jesus""....""what difference does his color make"" christianized black people to invest in this book! This would remove the scales from their eyes, I pray! I am very glad I purchased this book. The more African history I add to my library, the more culturally and spiritually proud I am to be a Black African Queen. I pray for the minds of our present black race to be enlightened by learning to study to show themselves approved and start reading for themselves, rather than letting some money-making schemer stand behind a podium rob them blind and continue to keep them spiritually and culturally blind. Mr. Windsor did a remarkable informative job!"
4,Through Knowledge of knowing who we are in the creator.,When I first ordered this book I was some what not quite sure if it was such a good idea. But after purchasing the book I was some what impress with the author. . This book is for anyone who is looking for a close relationship with the creator. And who wants to understand prophecies of Ezekiel. This book will open your eyes to a better understand of the world and the condition as to why certain people in our society are at the bottom of the food chain.
2,hostile author,From the very opening of the book the author insults the reader with streotypical views of black people. He also seems to arbitrarily through in GOD in places where it doesn't seem to make any sense. I'm only half way through and some of it does make sense but I think if he had left his opinions out it would have come across better to a reader. I almost wanted to stop in the very beginning but felt I could try and get an understanding for where he was coming from if I kept reading. Only in the middle of the book does he begin make sense to me but I'll keep reading.
3,"A good question, but no answer","In focusing on creativity and innovation as the font of economic growth and diversification, Florida is right on. But his recommendations for recruiting creative people are the same old smokestack-chasing strategies that have caused so much conflict and disappointment.If Florida's question makes sense to you, read Ernesto Sirolli's Ripples from the Zambezi for a great answer on how you can foster and nurture the creativity that already exists in your community, and help people turn their ideas into viable businesses."
1,"Writing about diversity, esp. controversial topics, sells!","Problems:1. His definition of creative class includes Doctors, Financial Planners who have been rated in a recent FastCompany article as the least creative -- just ask your primary physician or accountant2. He likes to believe that this Flight of the Creative Class because of our foreign policy etc. is the biggest challenge US has ever faced -- even bigger than Outsourcing. I agree that it is a problem but much smaller. If we look clearly, taking away the job of an average white collar american is much more devastating than not inviting one immigrant into the USA -- immigrants are big part of Mr Florida's creative class.3. Finally, Mr. Florida's claims are riddled with problems around casaulity ... Bohemian and gay indicies.I didn't read his book but attended a two hour speaking engagement -- which actually is usually better for me to absorb information comprehensively."
4,"Great, with some minor reservations","I like the basic premise. Really, I do. I just wish Mr. Florida was a little more dispassionate about Pittsburgh, his adopted home. Hey pal, if your thesis is true for Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis, and a bunch of other has-been older industrial towns, it's true for P'burgh too.That said, there's a lot to his ideas about identifying, quantifying, and ultimately valuing creative capital. Smart people doing creative things are worth more."
1,The Rise of the Creative Class,"Reads like a professor's text. A very interesting concept (I heard the author speak on a TV show which is why I bought the book) but the book is loaded with statistics and how he came up with his hypothesis and is a drag to read. My book club read it on my advice and very few bothered to finish it. I made myself finish it and even though I bought the second book, it lays on my self unread."
4,A must for sociologists and communicators.,An insightful annalisis of modern society. Reveals endless business posibilities from an entirely new perspective.
2,Imaginary History,"Richard Florida's thesis -- rising creativity as elixer of prosperity -- is astonishingly uninformed about American history. His attempt to reduce creativity to occupational counts from the census is misleading in the extreme. Consider, for instance, the inginuity in people like Eli Whitney, John Ireland Howe, or John D. Rockefeller None of the three would have fallen within a ""creative"" occupation on Florida's telling. Yet each of the three illustrates the kind of creativity which creates wealth for society."
3,Nobrow,"Reluctantly I must concur: this is a promising but ultimately disappointing study. I'm better versed in socio-cultural matters than the statistical-materialist approach taken by Florida to community and leisure studies. So let me just onfine myself to remarking that I wish he did not rely at all on John Seabrook's NOBROW (2000). The latter is an intellectually and analytically challenged New Yorker essay that parades as a book. Peter Swirski's FROM LOWBROW TO NOBROW is where Florida should have reached for conceptual support of his theses as regards the rise of what he terms ""creative class"" but what really amounts to a cross-sectin between sociological upper middle class and cultural nobrow consumers. Still, THE RISE OF CREATIVE CLASS is a bold attempt to chart the emergence of a novel socio-cultural formation and as such is worthy of attention (yes, it could do with better editing and mroe user-friendly presentation)."
2,Dogbert as a cult creative...outsource them all!!,"With the possible exception of educators, writers, artists, and entertainers, the jobs that these so-called 'creatives' perform will be outsourced to cheaper countries. One only has to read the business section of the Seattle dailies to confirm the notion that `creative class' be damned - many a company's decision to outsource various engineers, etc. to countries with cheaper sources of labor.""Cultural Creatives"" beware, if you work for anyone but yourself, you could be next."
2,What are you thinking?,"Unlike most of the other reviewers here, I didn't find the jargon to be too distracting, even though I'm not in the internet business. What I did find to be distracting was the underdeveloped characters and plot and careless writing. It's true that ""Eyeball Wars"" is fast-paced, energetic, and exciting: in fact, I read the book very quickly and honestly enjoyed it. But in terms of craft, it was low on the totem pole: the characters were two-dimensional and difficult to like, and the plot was predictable. There was also an unpleasantly distinct air of mysogyny running throughout as well, and that certainly didn't help. I certainly wouldn't say it's any masterpiece of literature because of these glaring issues, but it did have its moments."
2,Inside Politics,"I found the book a bit too much inside politics. What I mean by that is that you truly need to be a part of the dot com world to understand most of what is going on.I have worked in this world for several years and still many times I found it hard to follow.The style is typical of a first time author. I wouldn't say it isn't worth reading, but make sure you understand that you are entering a world filled with jargon and computer speak."
2,Oddly ironic,"Looking back now, ""Eyeball Wars"" is actually a fascinating portrait of the utter cluelessness and disregard for reality that was exhibited by the dot-commers prior to their bust. True, when Scott was writing this in 1999 and 2000, these words rang true--you really COULD go online with no business model and little content and make tons of money--generally through venture capital. Now we'd laugh at the notion, and that's why at this point no one could really take this book seriously. We've already seen how the dot-com boom didn't pan out and it was oddly enough because of the very business practices outlined in ""Eyeball Wars"". Yes, it's still horribly written, dripping with mysogyny, and lacking in character development, but from a historical standpoint ""Eyeball Wars"" is purely (unintentionally) fascinating, and a much more relevant and interesting read than it was two years ago."
1,No thanks!,"Unless you are an Internet junkie, I can't recommend this one. It is a valant effort by a first time author, but his characters don't seem real to me, and the Internet stuff is just a bit out of control.I would pass on this one."
5,Great book,I bought this book to improve my knowledge of teaching writing to kindergarteners. It is an excellent resource!! It was delivered promplty and in great condition! I highly recommend this seller.
2,"Fits well, but doesn't last.","While the mic fits securely well behind the ear and is quite comfortable, I've had constant trouble with faulty wires. I've worked my way through 4 of these now (at $280 a pop) in a matter of 12 months (at a church). Yes, each is used at least once a week, but for $280/each I would hope that they would last past 12 months.I'm now looking seriously at a Countryman E6 microphone. While more expensive, they have a snap-on cable if it goes bad for only $15. Much better than buying new each time. Right?"
2,The Julian Casablancas Leather Jacket Fund,"Fans of the Strokes, beware. Anyone spoiled by Hal Leonard tablature books will find this to be somewhat disappointing, more of an attempt to milk more out of the cash cow that is the Strokes than an honest, thoughtful attempt at accurately transcribing their music. Having said that, let me break it down for anyone still on the fence. If you're not very competent at the guitar and want to eventually be able to bust out the solo from ""Last Nite"" at parties, this is the book for you. However, if you have already put a lot of time into figuring out how to play these songs and are hoping that this tab book will clarify some of the more difficult chords here and there on the album, you're out of luck--e-mail me instead. I hate to say it but a lot of this tablature is just plain WRONG. Shamefully easy parts of songs too, that the Strokes have been live on Conan O'Brian playing with their fretboards right up in the camera's face. So there you have it."
1,The Worst Book Ever,"This book was horrible. It didn't have enough pictures, and wasn't in large enough print. They used complex words that I couldn't understand. The cover was also an embarrisment to the book! So don't buy this book EVER! If you do you would be out the money.. but may have a new door stop!"
2,Don't listen to thes idiots....,First off I'd like to say something. I like most of the bands on this CD. I want you all to realize what this is. these guys are anarchists telling how much they hate Bush. This is not worth buying unless you are as well an anarchist. I'm not talking about some kid who drew an anarchy sign on their school notebook. I am talking about someone who is absically like a terrorist. I don't particularly agree with this but if you do that's cool. Another thing these guys probably don't support Kerry. If they did they wouldn't be true anarchists. A true anarchist would believe in no candidates whatsoever. Anywyas i doesn't matter now bush wonso these guys should shut up about it now and just make the real CDs.
1,Dumb Stuff,uhhh dude like this is dumb i just wana hear a good song wiht moving lyrics not lyrics about who our presdent is-o and by the way dudes i think my own ways i dont need to hear your openion get back to real music please!stupid liberals
3,first off...,"If youre a fan of Bush why would you be looking at a cd titled 'rock AGAINST Bush' in the first place? We're not here to hear about how much respect you have for a man whos driving our country into the ground. We want to know about the music, not your delusional loyalty for someone who obviously has no respect for you or this country. If you are here to go on and on about how much you hate this cd because and only because you, for some strange reason, love Bush... get a life. Do you honestly have nothing better to do then go arround on a site bashing anything and everything that goes against your beloved president? Now... onto the music. some of the bands are good. however it does not show in this album. it is a waste of a perfectally good cd."
5,To paraphrase another...,"""Not only are the songs on this album subpar even by todays ""punk"" standards, the lyrics are aweful.Written by a bunch of underedecuted Bush haters who I would gladly smack in the face and overwhelm with my intellect, their songs happily reflect their ignorance.""First of all, to call the bands on this cd ""underedecuted"" is a big ol' ironic pun huh? Get a spelling lesson, then call us uneducated.To actually review this cd, it is awesome. There really isn't anything more to say to that."
3,"Giving it the benefit of the doubt, but...","Musically speaking, a lot of these songs and bands are pretty good. The only thing that bugs me is how it seems that a lot of punks (both bands and individual people) jump on the liberal bandwagon without even thinking. They end up coming across just as blind, intolerant, and annoying as the conservatives they think they are fighting. Personally, I try to think for myself. Some people want to let others do the questioning for them, and so they'll just accept anyone who seems to be questioning the status quo. The truth of the matter is, however, that you gotta question *everything*, including the self-proclaimed questioners. You can be a sheep following anyone. I love the punk scene, but I get sick when I see people worshipping people like Michael Moore just because it's the cool, liberal, anti-establishment thing to do. I don't let Bush OR liberal propagandists do my thinking for me. And for the record, I *am* against Bush, but for my own reasons..."
5,Punk at it's best!,"I clicked ""buy"" the second I saw this album. How can you pass up such an amazing compilation value these days? The fact that the proceeds go to a good cause is just icing.The music:Injustice, anger, and dissent have fueled all the really great punk. I might have changed a few tracks on this record but overall it is a surprisingly listenable collection of very visceral music. I'd heard most of the older bands before and loved their new stuff, but was most pleased to be introduced to some of the bands I hadn't heard before. I think that's one of the keys to a really great compilation because it gets kids listening to some classic punk and old farts like me listening to the new stuff.It seems as if all the people who have bashed the record so far don't even like punk or are adamant Bush supporters. Why did you guys buy it?"
1,Bush Rocks...good bands go to waste,"Bush is awesome...u cant disssss dubya......these WERE such good bands...it appears NOFX has started something, a giant train wreck that can't be stopped...but Bush-bashers can stop jumping on the bandwagon and just SHUT UP!"
3,a toss up,"Although i absolutely cant stand the reason they made this cd, i do think that the best music is from inspired people. if only they had better inspiration...."
1,Rock for George W. Bush,I am a Intellectual like many of the people who listen to this.For one I am sure this was not well produced and was rushed togeather for politcal propaganda. Well all I have to say is Ha Ha Ha.Bush rules he is nice to all people and gets crap for it.They care about you so help him out.If you are a college kid that does not want to go to the military don't attack them they are not bad they are helping to liberate 25 million people.If you want to see the differences between Clinton and Bush go and see the reviews by Proud Texan
1,This CD is great!,"This CD is awesome! I had every intention of going out and buying albums from some of these artists until the nice people at Fat Wreck Records told me that they were all morons. Now I don't have to waste my money. Thanks, Rock Against Bush!"
3,Decent Punk no matter if you love Bush or Kerry,"Wow. I thought everyone was writing a review on music here, not presidencies...regardless of your orientation, (I'm an Independent) this has a few solid tracks in it, like always, not everything is everyone's cup of tea. I have to agree that I like the old bad religeon song better than the ataris version, but personal preference again comes to mind. Yellowcard does a good job, and so does a few others, but its at least worth your while if you are a neo-punk fan, if you're old school, Jello Biafra is here, and also worth listening to again. Just don't buy this because of political orientations or not buy it because of the title. That's just silly. Get it for the music."
2,what is this?,"i don't even know why i bought this album. none of the songs are even all that good. except one. the one song that got it 2 stars as opposed to one? Alkaline Trio's ""Warbrain."" That is a really great song. But NOFX sucks, and fat mike throwing a record together couldnt do anything BUT suck. Blink 182 coulda been on here too. I mean tom was such a kerry supporter. That coulda made the CD better to. But if you can find a way to get Warbrain by other means i would do so"
4,Son of Let Them Eat Jellybeans,Rock Against Rock Vol. 1 picks up where Alternative Tentacles' early-80s release Let Them Eat Jellybeans left off. It's politcally charged punk at its best.
1,Simply put...,"Put simply, this is precisely the sort of nonsense one might expect from the dimwitted clods shuffling out of America's schools, diplomas clutched in grubby mitts. Studies have clearly shown, of course, just how deficient the schools have become, while perversely amplifying self-esteem beyond all objective reason. Not to put too fine a point on it, but this is a collection of idiots shouting unsupportable propaganda with all the confidence you'd expect from anyone whose ""knowledge"" centers around their own ego (and id, for that matter). Which is to say, it mirrors the MTV generation perfectly. After listening to this, anyone would understand if you were moved to exhort the next slack-jawed 15-year-old drooler you come across to read a history book instead of pawing through Howard Zinn. But then, you'd be wasting your time, because the kids aren't alright - they can't read.One might hope that at least the music would be good. It is not."
1,Nobody Listened,"One of the greatest things about America is that you can start over again, make a new life.Which, I imagine, might be something the producers of this CD might be planning on right now. Not only did they produce one, but TWO ""Rock Against Bush"" albums, to no avail.Hopefully, the re-election of the Republican scion of the WASP Kennedys will sound a death knell to the celebrity political endorsement industry. Perhaps we will in the future vote based upon studying the issues, not because Bruce Springsteen or NOFX thinks voting for Kerry is cool. Conversely, perhaps those on the right will vote based upon calm reflection and study as well, not because some country singer at a Sean Hannity Freedom Concert told them to vote for Dubya.To all of them, I ask them to consider the relevance of Bob Dylan's query:How does it feel?To be on your own?A complete unknown?Like a rolling stone?"
1,sigh - washed up bands snatching your $$$,"Oh goody, another music album against President Bush and the war. How original. Let's sing protest songs against an administration that captured the most brutal dictator of our generation, yippee!!! Revolution! To be honest, didn't know Pennywise and Strung Out were still a band. Kinda sad. These washed up bands with their 40 year old bodies still have their 15 year old punk rock minds but without an original thought to sing about. Pure vomit. And oh good, there's a volume 2 now to take 14 to 15 year old punk rock skater kids' money (who cannot even vote). And we wonder why punk rock died."
1,Bummer,"Dude... I USED TO really enjoy Alkaline Trio, NOFX, Strung Out, The Descendents (On this comp. or not, they suck now), Pennywise, and the Get Up Kids... Bummer!"
1,Musicians asking to be boycotted.,"I'm becoming tired of musicians and celebrities providing their opinions about politics, because they are usually morons. Here is a sizable list of morons. Musicians should understand the less we know about them the better."
1,"Haha, Kerry was crying...","Ah, so totally irrelevant now, your little rantings didn't help kids. There's a saying that goes: minority is heard, majority wins, and that's how it went down here thank goodness. Anyone who bought into this was buying into the so called corporate monster anyway, so in conclusion, who's the real American Idiot?"
2,oh man,"punk rock isnt rocking out against bush...its about rebellion in any shape or form.this guy is right...joey ramone was conservative.Just because i dont like bush dosent mean i need to lay down however much this piece of crap costs. Everyone who likes this for the message is into ""punk"" for the wrong reasons. Its about the music not the message. Most of the songs on here are subpar."
2,hey i hate bush but...,look i really despise bush. he's an idiot. and i know people are gonna have different opinions on that. but what i wish wouldnt happen is people giving this 5 stars cause its against bush and they agree. seriously the music is really not good. however if you do buy it make sure you watch the DVD eh? its got a great will farrel skit on it. 2 stars for that and the few decent songs on here (ie no w by the ministry)thats all
2,Some good music...,"Theres some good music here, but theres also some bad music. Personally I'm embarressed that some good bands actually degraded themselves by putting their music on this CD. The people who made it our idiots and for that reason I wouldn't buy it..."
3,Not Bad,"I'm a big fan of punk and a hater of bush, and i have to recommend this album to anyone who is either of the two. i wasn't too pleased with bands like NFG, Sum 41, and the Ataris on there, because they're your typical pop-punk bands but the rest of the artists are good. It's not a cd i can listen to all the way through but it's a good buy for the buck."
2,Not my taste,I can't believe this book got a 5 star rating. I don't believe any of the sex scenes. They are immature and I don't find this book believeable. The realationship in talk and physical is not believeable. I thought I would be reading a good story line and good romance scenes. Didn't happen. I am very disappointed. Will not buy the authors book ever again.
4,Oh My,I loved Connor! This book was soooo good and I can't wait to read book three. Each book just gets better and better.
4,Promising author,"I have read both Standing in the Shadows and Behind Closed Doors. They are well written and everything but I wish there was a little more buildup to where her characters become involved. You get a chapter or two into her stories and pretty soon theres this marathon sex going on, over and over every chapter. Theres no innocence or buildup involved, just a short period at the beginning and then its like they've done it and redone it and there you have it. My advice would be keep your great characters, just carry them along a little more because it gives the reader more to look foward to."
1,My own fault...,"I am disgusted that I read this book and it's my own fault. After reading Behind Closed Doors and finding it a ridiculous waste of time (how many ways can you describe sex on page after page after page??), I told myself this one had to be better.After all, it couldn't get worse, right?? I was WRONG!The male and female leads are cartoons who apparently don't have a functioning brain cell between them...but why do you need brains to have sex 5,6,or 7 times a day?This is nothing more than a copy of Behind Closed Doors with the names changed. Same bad guys, same sex scenes, same ridiculous plot right down to the dressing of the female character in sexy clothes and makeup, just like the first book.What a waste."
1,Over use of profanity,"The story line was very well written, however I cannot get past the over use of profanity in Ms. McKenna's writing. Her characters use the Lord's name in vain as if it is the catch phrase of the year. I was so taken aback by the use, I wrote Ms. McKenna concerning this unfortunate choice of expression and she said she was sorry, but would continue the use because the characters in her books are alive in her head. If her characters are so insolent....what does that say about her?"
2,Not worth finishing,"Few books are so bad that I won't even finish reading them. In that respect, this one takes the cake."
5,Remarkable!!!,This book is so intense that I'm always on the edge of my seat while reading it. I can almost feel Connor's passion to protect Erin because of his love to her. You are very talented author Ms. McKenna and I enjoy this series so much. This book did not disappoint and I'm glad I bought it.
2,Over the top and uninteresting..,"I think the only thing that prevents this book from reading like a bad movie is that the hero doesnt have a catch phrase that he repeats every time he beats people up. I am willing to suspend disbelief and buy into the premise of an entire family of stunningly handsome super-ninjas but everything about this book over the top! The villain is sooo bad that he is a cliche and his master-plan is so convoluted that it makes James bond villains look normal. It is good that the lead characters are already in love with each other because I don't think the author would have been able to create a bond between them convincingly. It would have helped if the unending sex had any sizzle to it :).Overall, not worth the money or time."
4,Standing in the Shadows,"Connor McCloud was seriously injured in the last book, and has injuries to his body as well as betrayal to overcome in this story. He has always loved Erin Riggs, but now feels he must protect her from the threat that took her father. Very sensual and dark erotic scenes will steal your breath. This well written thrilling story continues."
4,Steamy- 4 &1/2 stars,"I didn't think I would be able to finish a book that 80% of the character and plot development happened in the bedroom, but Shannon McKenna successfully pulls it off. Erin and Connor have great chemistry (thankfully or this book would have been painful). The scenes outside the bedroom were fast paced, and there were several laugh out loud moments (involving Erin's mom and a car, among others). If you were disappointed with McKenna's other two full length novels, give this one a try. It's by far the best of the three."
2,Needs editing,"Frankly, there was TOO MUCH SEX. Ordinarily that is not a problem <g> but in this book, it really didn't advance the characters much after the first critical scene, maybe one or 2 others, but mostly began to get repetitive, while trying to be erotic. Connor was an interestingly tortured hero, but Erin was not as clearly defined, and her dialog/motivations occasionally slipped very close to ludricrous. And jeez for someone she loved for so long, she doesn't trust him much, doing almost completely opposite of what he wants her to do, just to get herself into trouble. Yeah, the bad guys were really creepy, but c'mon, once you get the girl in your clutches, ya let her go?? Argh. And, jeez, all that talk about no-condom sex and no repercussions? How very un-politically correct!"
5,What a great read!,"I recommend that you read ""Behind Closed Doors"" first. It is just as excellent and will give you a heads-up as to who is who in this book. I cannot put this book down. You kinda get involved with the characters and they feel so real and raw! The sexual energy is sizzling. I wish there were more books of Ms. McKenna that I could read. You will be more than satisfied with all of her works."
2,Already owned a pair and these are tight.,"These are the same brand, style, and size pants that were already in my closet and purchased at a Kenneth Cole store about 2 years ago, however they are tight. The pair in my closet fits with room to spare. The size and UPC codes are identical."
5,A perfect pair,"These are absolutely nice pants. Very good looks and great finish. Measurements are correct for me as well. I am 5' 5"" and my waist measure 34"". I usually buy a 32x29 and these are just right for me. Just like Levis.I highly recommend these to anyone who is looking for a well made but not too expensive pair of pants. I bought Khaki and Black and started wearing them straight away. No alterations needed so I can retain the great finish.I will buy more when the prices go down a bit more.I ordered another one in Stone at 24.95$ from Macy's. These are really nice polyester pants. Care should be taken while ironing not to leave any marks on them."
2,"Nice pants, but leg hem fell apart on both pairs I purchased.","After about 4-5 uses, the right leg hem on one and the left leg hem on the other fell apart. I only wash on delicate (label says permanent press), and I'm certainly not rough on them. I had 2 pair of the same type of pants (diff size) for about 4 years and loved them which is why I bought these. Trying to work with Amazon.com now to exchange as I'm looking at $15 each to go to an alteration place.Other than the hem issue the pants are nice."
4,Good Solid Workpants,These are great for the office. A little thicker than your typical dress slacks. Crease stays reasonably well with little ironing.
1,Don't be hoodwinked,"I was amazed at how many big name movie stars are in this made for DVD musical. The only decent song in the whole show is one borrowed from the 60's/70s rock group Sam the Sham and the Pharohs. If you wish your children watching other children spitting on adults as sport then this is the movie for you. There are other instances that I found disgusting. While this is an updated version of LIttle Red Riding Hood, I would not recommend this for 12 and under. Young teens will find the spitting and other vulgarities humerous, I'm sure."
1,my most hated purchase,I thought by the description that this was a good children film. This was such a boring waste of money. Everything sounds good looks good but does not deliver.
3,dissaointing,I fought this film was going to be much better. First it is a musical but the song make me cringe. Second the wolf had a creepiness about him. Take for example his song he dreams about cooking children and putting them on sandwiches. Also he eats many people and it is onscreen (Not gory but disturbing). These victims include little girls. But I still like this film.
3,RED RIDING HOOD,"I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A BETTER STORY FOR A CHILD, BUT THIS MOVIE IS FOR ADULTS....IF YOU LIKE BORING.....SORRY"
5,modern family fum,"This movie is so entertaining I watch it with my children every time they put it on. We quote it, and sing along all the time. I rented it and my 4, and 2 year old girls watched it so much i had to buy it."
3,not the best...,I ordered this dvd for my niece (4). It was not what I expected. My niece doesn't care for it too much either. I think she might enjoy it more when she's a little older.
1,Simply Awful,"Any reviewer who trashes a film or book will always run the risk of being seen as merely a bomb-throwing fanatic whose viewpoints are unworthy of consideration in polite company. I will run that risk with this film. It was difficult to tell with accuracy how unimpressed were my 9 year old and 4 year old girls were, but one can get an idea by the fidgeting and apparent disinterest they displayed. As for me, I would say it was simply awful to the point of being cringe-inducing and unwatchable. Save your money and time."
2,"Kenny G lovers, Disc 2 is for you","Definitely not the best in the Winter's Solstice series, this is a mixed bag at best. Disc I is much like the others; if you like others in the series, you'll like these instrumental pieces. Disc 2 is disappointing; it's a collection of songs reminiscent of what you'd get on a ""Light (or Lite) Hits"" pop radio station. The songs are unremarkable, and the voices are a distraction. For my money, Winter's Solstice 5 is the best so far, but this does not meet that standard."
4,Classic Japanese Motorcycles (Illustrated Buyer's Guide),"This book is well written. It is a great reference for someone wanting to know more about old Asian motorbikes. If you are already a huge fan of vintage Japanese bikes, you may well know most of this information. Even so, it is wonderful to have all of it at your fingertips..."
4,Compilation: heads up!,"Be careful, except for remixes of a few songs, this album is a compilation of previous material from the band. Not that this is bad, Just a heads up, since there's not much else information about the album here."
4,ITS WORTH IT,"Yes , this is a compolation but there is a track called hermano that is worth this cd. I would buy it if your are a fan of the music. But their best cds are leche,versus and ninja mental."
3,A bit flimsy,"I was expecting a beefier net. I fish saltwater for striped bass and this net MAY last me one season. Not bad for around $20, but just realize it's not as beefy as the picture might imply. Still a good value for the money."
5,musically creative,"my 1st Eluveitie cd was Slania. and it took me really long to buy Spirit. but when Spirit came in, I realized its far more better than Slania. This band is just aswesomely creative with their music style.."
2,Not so good,"I recently bought this game and was thoroughly disappointed. Even though it's an XBox game, I've seen as good, if not better graphics on the N64. The controls are a bit awkward also. There is also no way to save unless you are in a level. I'd say it's worth the $9 I paid for it though."
3,"Pretty good, Could have been better","This game is a third-person/first person lightsaber weilding ride. It is very fun at times but has some weak points.Pros: They added dual and double lightsabers to the game.You can customize your character.You can choose your path, light or dark.Multiplayer is fun.Cons: The graphics could have been better.Utilizing all of your force is nearly impossible.You have to save a lot.Lightsaber fighting is not really a matter of skill.One other thing that Really got on my nerves was that if you decide to be one of the alien characters you have the same voice and name as the human character, the only difference being male and female.But when you come down to it, it's entertaining even if slightly annoying."
3,Like new?,The description was like new and there were scratch all over the cd.As for the game it is amazing and have loved playing it.
4,Might be Older but still great for any star wars fan out there.,I got this game years ago for christmas after I received my original xbox. I am a huge Star Wars fan and I loved the game so much back then that I used to play it constantly one gameplay after another. I recently got an Xbox 360 and got out my old xbox games and started playing it again. It is just as I remember it. I love the strategies of gameplay where different missions become available after checking out different things having to do with the cult. I love the story line now just as much as I did and love that it had to do with the Jedi Academy. Of course the graphics aren't going to be anything like any of the new games out there with all the improved graphics but even with games such as force unleashed it is still my most favored star wars game of all time and I have played the star wars games since getting the super nintendo.
5,Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy,"Came in right on time, nothing wrong with the game played great and played more then ever thought.no complaints from me Thanks."
3,Nothing New,"This game is to similar to JK Outcast. Apart from the fact that you are not playing as Kyle this felt like the same thing. I was more like an expqansion than a new game. Not that JK Oucast was bad, its just old.Also the Quake 3 engine is really showing its age. I woudl reccomend this game if you have not played JK Outkast, otherwise stay away from it.Unless you like multipalyer, the Xbox live play is fun."
1,Not what I expected,"I rented this game, and boy, am I glad. The graphics are blocky and unrealistic. The gameplay overall is generally fun, with helpful first-person shooting and third-person lightsaber combat. However, lightsaber combat is basically hacking at each other until eventually one keels over and dies, pressing the button over and over until you win. Often I found it difficult to know what the heck I was supposed to do/where I was supposed to go. The controls are simple, but basically you use the two thumbsticks and the fire button. That's all. If you feeel like a semi-fun Star Wars experience, go out and rent this game, but don't waste your hard earned money on yet another one of Lucas Arts moneymaking scams that only exists because Star Wars is in the name."
3,Not Impressed,This game was a disappointent to say the least. The play control leaves a lot to be desired and the storyline is weak. If you are interested in this game you might want to try it out on the PC which offers better control.
4,hmmmmmmm....(Sigh),"I have to say that this is the biggest disappointment in videogame history. Being a big fan of Jedi Outcast, I egarly rushed out to buy this game. What I got was a rushed peice of crap. The graphics are really, rally, bad. The story is weak too and you don't even get to play as Kyle! Yah sure you get to create your own character, but the cration isn't nearly as cool as Kyle."
4,good fun,"dude if ur a fan of Jk2 you'll love it. If your a disiponted person who bought jk2 and []couldnt get past the first level this game is for you. I garrentee any starwars fan will apreciate this exellent title. I own it on pc and love it, who could not its online, easyer than jk2 and you can learn all new ways to use the saber like two at once or darth mauls double bladed. I wish i waited to getr this edition of jk3 insted of the pc one mostly cause im a fan of xbox live and ehat it has to offer."
5,Jedi Academy,My opinion about this game is that it is fun. The reason this game is cool is because you can choose sides and sabers. Hideouts get you out of trouble. The level I think is hardest is Castle of the Dark Lord. The best feature of the game is riding hover bikes with guns on them. Riding hover bikes is fun. I recommend this game to fans of Star Wars.
4,WOW,Star wars games dont generally impress me but i bought this one for my bro. I was amazed by the gameplay and the graphics and the force and the customizable lightsaber and the customizeable character. Any one who is a fan of star wars I suggest u buy this. If u rnt i suggest u buy this. This game is so sweet and theres nothing noticbly wrpng with it except the controls are a bit hard to get down(for instace to do a wallrun you do up up a side r) But theres alot of combos that you can do!
5,Simply the finest shaving cream made.,"Not an exaggeration. Castle Forbes makes the most unique shaving cream on the market today. Endless lather, kind to sensitive skin, provides a noticeably closer shave, rinses clean from your face and brush easier than any other product I've used. This is the only shaving cream I will buy from now on. You only need a tiny bit. This container will last you at least a year. Try it!"
5,Expensive but luxurious,"If you like a high quality shaving cream with a strong lime scent then then search no further. Compared to other lime scented creams such as Geo F. Trumpers Limes, which is very muted and subtle, this is more in your face (which I prefer). Great lathering and shave lubrication, too."
5,Castle Forbes Shave Cream,"This shave cream is absolutely amazing!! Produces the richest, thickest lather you can imagine and the pleasing lime scent is wonderful as well. Castle Forbes Lime provides a great amount of cushion and comfort to your shave and leaves your skin feeling moisturized and silky smooth without the need for aftershave balm. Of the hundreds of shave creams and soaps I have tried in every price range, CF Lime is without doubt one of if not the best of them. The price is certainly not cheap but the generous sized tube will last you a very long time. If you have not tried it do yourself and your face a favor!!"
5,"watched it 3 times, still great","This is hands down one of the most engaging and true to life documentaries I have ever seen. It's informative, enlightening, and hilarious. Not only does it show the world of engineering and robotics, it demonstrates the extraordinary capabilities of teenagers leading ordinary lives. I recommend this film because it's a great watch (no matter how many times you see it) but it also goes to show what kids these days can do."
3,B+ British mystery with character study,"Unlike Agatha, there is insight into the mundane psychology of characters as well as their motivations. Thomson writes a relatively standard plot, and gives it surprisingly normal characters, and then goes to work making murder seem as commonplace as it is. Unfortunately for American readers, it isn't very dramatic, and unfortunately for British readers, there's not enough placement of silly objects and incriminating statements to really keep a gin-soaked mind chewing away at the ""clews."" Yet I found Ms. Thomson's writing to be honest and brave in its exploration of the human side of murder. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes British-style murder mysteries."
4,"""Life is clear for me up there alone..""","""In the sky I found, even in my enemies, courage, honour and chivalry. On the ground..."" he shrughs his shoulders.Somewhat interesting performances from Redford and Sarandon, etc. It tried to capture something of the post WWI era (late 20s early 30s) and specifically within that era, the story of a few ex-fighter pilots trying to make it in civilian life as aerial acrobats and stunt flyers.In a world where mundane survival has seemed to trivialize everything then, the theme was in reminicing about a time when life seemed to have had more meaning.There was nothing bad about this movie. I found it to be fairly interesting, quaint, but not riviting. One may dare say a bit 'slow' at times. Still, it was produced well and would probably appeal to pilots or fans of early airplanes (or early Redford). Worth a watch, but not the most intriguing movie I ever saw."
1,"Wait until Widescreen release - August 3, 2010","This movie is one of my all time favorites. I was lucky enough to see it at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood when I was a young boy. What an experience! The problem is that this version of the movie is not even close to what the original was. Pan and scan is bad enough, but with a movie like this, where the wide open sky is a real part of the film, it is destroyed by the editing. There are so many movies to see, do yourself a favor and wait until ""The Great Waldo Pepper"" is released in a widescreen version. You won't regret it.Edit:I just received this email from Universal Pictures;""Dear Fan of ""The Great Waldo Pepper,""We are pleased to announce that his film will become available on DVD on August 3.We appreciate your interest in our films and hope that you will enjoy this and many future releases.Sincerely,Consumer RelationsUNIVERSAL STUDIOS HOME ENTERTAINMENT"""
4,"""The Great Waldo Pepper""","In regards to ""The Great Waldo Pepper"" I agree with most of the DVD/vhs viewers: Lets re-release it widescreen!I just watched it on a DVD I tranferred from VHS three years ago! The original VHS was recorded from the Disney Channel back in December of '05.I did notice on the end credits it was filmed in Todd-AO. This means it was done in a widescreen Cinemascope process. The only difference here is that Todd-AO is filmed at 30 frames per second - so it would be easier to transfer to DVD and a higher quality as well. Maybe Universal is waiting to release it on Blu-Ray!? The Goodtime label seems to be a bootleg."
5,My Cousin's Bo,"This is such a fun film. It is considered a cult film, where people go to see the movie many times. This story leads up to the actor - Bo Brundin's- entry into the story. This movie is a classic and I highly recommend for anyone to add it to their library of films."
1,usless,These people are selling a product that is useless in the United States. Their dvd will not play here. They are stealing money and Amazon or Paypal can not help. BEWARE
5,A Magical Movie Gets Shoddy DVD Treatment,I'm not going to re-review this movie because the almost universal raves say it all. The true tragedy is that this magical movie's exceptional flying sequences are muddled in this terrible full screen transfer. Watching this in full screen is like watching Lawrence of Arabia or Dr. Zhivago in full screen ... pointless. Please give this movie a new widescreen transfer ... it more than deserves it.
4,"Good, but missions on-foot suck","I ran to buy this game when it came out. I was a bit dissapointed with the walking-missions because you only have to tap the A button as fast as you can and there are very few movements. I also thought that when you got the lightsaber, you would have some kick-ass moves, but you can oly deflect lasers and hit enemies.On the other hand, I liked a lot most of the flight missions (especially the ""Fondor"" one, where you steal a tie hunter). The missions in speeder bike and AT-ST are VERY good (I rally liked the one in the forest because those funny bear things, apart from helping you dropping logs to desroy the other AT-STs, can be squashed).Another thing that I didn't like was that it was a bit too short and the last bonus mission (the onethat goes before the frustrating level called Rebel something) that seemed to be the one of the best in the game, was way too easy."
3,OK I GUESS,THIS GAME WAS HYPED WAY TOO MUCH.I GOT IT HOME AND REALIZED IT WAS NOT AS VISUALLY STUNNING AS ROGUE SQUADRON.THE ON FOOT MISSIONS ARE CLUNKY AND HARD TO TARGET ENEMYS.ALMOST FELT LIKE YOU WERE PLAYING TAG INSTEAD OF SHOOTING THEM.AND THE GAME ALSO SEEMED ABNORMALLY DARK HAD TO TURN UP BRIGHTNESS ON MY HDTV TO SEE SOME OF THE ACTION.I MEAN OVERALL IT WAS A FUN GAME AND IM STILL ON THE SECOND LEVEL ALOT TO GO YET.BUT I WAS MORE IMPRESSED WITH ROGUE SQUADRON.
1,did not work,the disk was ruined. And I dont know what to do about it to get my money back. Very disappointed.
3,Buy it for the Space Mission...,"I'm a huge fan of the space missions. Unfortunately the on-foot missions were so bad I was forced to stop playing this. Haven't gone back to play it, which is unfortunate because I was looking forward to the lightsaber."
3,rebel strike,"First off, I was a huge fan of rouge squadron 1 and 2, and the first week it was out, I bought this game. I have to say I am greatly disappointed. The graphics have imporved, but nothing else has. The on foot missions are not well designed, and the camera angles are bad. The targeting system often locks on to enemies that are behind cover, instead of locking on to the enemy right in front of you, shooting you. The missions where you fly are only average... On the contrary, the multiplayer is very fun. You can play RS2 in cooperative, and there is also a versus mode. Overall this game is average, and I would rent it before you rush out and spend $50 on it."
2,Very Very Disapointing,"I rented this game for a weekend and I am extremely I bought Jak II instead of this. When I rented this I was ready to stay up all night playing it, after an hour I put it away. This game is a horrible disgrace of the star wars game license which is getting a bad reputation as it is. If it didn't have ground missions this game would have four stars, but those idiots at LucasArts thought ""Let's try to annoy game fans in an all new dimension"" and they added pointless idiotic ground missions. The flying missions and AT-AT or AT-ST or whatever missions are pretty good but can be annoying/confusing, hard core star wars fans should buy this because they will actually keep trying to win those stupid ground missions, but if you just want a good space shooting game get a different rogue squadron game A GOOD ONE!!! So if you like being frustrated out of your mind this is the game for you"
3,It's Star Wars!,"You know whatever you say about the look of the game and the fact that it has a few game play issues, doesn't detract from what it is...a good fun Star Wars game. I dare you to bring down a AT-AT on Hoth and tell me it wasn't great fun..."
1,Why?,"Nooooooo! Why do Luke and Wedge run around like headless chickens? Please stay inside your vehicles and don't come out :(I like the vehicle boards. So when I have to share with my kid brother, I make him play the stoopid boards where you run around as Luke (after eating too much of Yoda's chilli )"
3,"cool, but hard","Its almost impossible to get a medal.If you do not like very hard games, do not buy this game!"
1,"Sorry, but this game blows.","You cannot change the camera angle at all; sometimes you can't see where you are or what you are doing. The only even partially good missions (no missions are any good, I just mean the ones that are better than others) are the ones in which you are in space in a starfighter. On land, walking, you can't see what you are doing most of the time, and there are only a few controls: shoot your gun, move, and roll or jump. There is only one weapon, the gun, and one way to use it. Aiming is strange, the game is overall completely boring, with a hideous storyline that gets old fast, and poor controls. I have not played the other Rogue Squadron games, maybe they are better. DO NOT EVER WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS GAME!I wish I could give this game ZERO STARS."
5,BE SMART. BE VICTORIOUS!,"This game is awesome because there are three arcade games that you can play that were released by Atari in 1983. There are also lots of other cool things about this game that I love, but my favorite mission is Fondor Shipyard Assault. You get to protect a rebel transport that is programmed to run into a shield station. You can play bonus missions like Attack on the Executor and Flight from Bespin. Those are my favorites because they are challenging and fun. It's like in the movies, but different because the player gets to be a part of the action. I would recommend this game to every Star Wars fan!"
3,Not as Great as ROGUE LEADER was,"REBEL Strike is great and feuatures some very interesting levels but kinda weird and ceratinly inaccurate. THe fact that Wedge runs into Obi-Wan's Jedi Starfighter was really random and bizarre. The whole plot line is crappy and very weird. It follows no set plot. Wedge's voice is really done poorly. The pyrotechnics are also reduced and the TIE fighters don't blow apart as much as to careen towards the ground. I like more blowing up TIE fighterhs than sending TIE fighters to their deaths. Some interesting levels though and the ground combat is unique. THe ground combat is actally pretty bad. All in all, not for everyone, just people who like arcade style flight shooters. Even Star Wars fans might not enjoy this."
4,Where's the camera man? This darn thing is jammed again!,"First of all, in the stupid on-foot missions, (which don't even make any sense) the camera NEVER moves in the right direction! I'm sitten' here shooting into who knows where, while I'm practiccly loking at the wall!(Factor 5, what are you thinking?)OK, die-hard Star Wars fans, I really liked this game except for that camera! As always, the flight missions are AWWWW(...)SOME!But still, why can't you fly in the Battlefield Hoth mission? I mean, you should tie up some AT-ATs before crashing.Oh, and by the way, I'd rather tie up walkers on Hoth rather than Ralltiir. Other than that, I'd say the game is pretty good. (I love the arcade when your Darth Vader. I always imagine his fingers pushing da buttons. May the Force be with you. And get a haircut Wedge!)"
2,Disappointing,"This game was a huge disappointment for me. I loved the first Rogue Squadron on the N64 and still love and play Rogue Leader on my GC, but this game just had me disgusted. The levels all seem to rush you from one cinematic to the next. I know the medals all have strict time requirements but in Rebel Strike it felt like there wasn't any free time to explore or just have some fun shooting down Imperials. How are you supposed to get any of the upgrades? For me a game must first be fun and I didn't have any fun."
2,This game is the Episode 2 of the Rogue Squadron franchise,"that pretty much sums it up. the first 2 were great and everyone had high expectations of this one. only to be slightly bored most of the time and have excitment few and far in between. YOU CAN LEAVE THE COCKPIT!!!!!! No friggin way!@!@ !@ yeah but the controls are aweful and all you do is give the A button a work out. There's a 2 player mode!!!!! yeah but the only thing exciting about that is the co-op of Rouge Leader. some of the missions are kinda cool though the problem is you'll have to play through so much garbage you'll be afraid to continue on to finds these rare gems. Ok os here is what you should do instead...go buy Rogue Leader. you can probably find it somewhere for like 10 bucks.k and if you already own that one....i don't know, take a nap or something."
3,"Not bad, but...","Anyone who rated this game a 5 out of 5 in clearly a plant from Lucas Arts, or someone from Amazon that just wants you to buy the game. The levels in which you pilot a ship are great, but unfortunately the levels where you move Luke, Wedge or Han around on foot nearly ruin the game. They move awkwardly, the auto targeting picks poor targets, and for some inexplicable reason, you can't control your viewing angle. Apparantly Lucas Arts thought movie clips would make up for poor gameplay."
4,Good addition but not great,"THis is a great on on game to the others in this line. Nice to get new missions and new vehicles. The speeder bike ones arent too much fun as they are a little to unforgiving. The AT-ST is a nice addition but the missions seem to easy with them, they take a lot of hits and dish out lots of firepower. The biggest flaw by far are the foot missions. This should have just been left out. They didnt take the time to make them full featured and seem more of an add on, a really annoying add on. Some of the missions are great but the foot action in between the flying ruins the overall effect. To sum up great vehicle parts but the foot missions bring it down"
4,Excellent,We're fans of Brule' so this was a natural purchase. Very good mix of Native American sounds with New Age type music. We really like this album.
3,Disappointed !!,"As a fan of Native American music, I was disappointed with this album. I have the Holy Nigth album, which is much higher than this.I found this album well short of the potential of the group, the songs do not thrilled and very similar, not even had a song that in my opinion deserve note up 3 stars"
4,Wonder Woman vs. Superman,"Two of the Big 3 throw down in this collection! Wonder Woman makes a life-changing decision that drives a wedge between the Big 3 (herself, Superman, and Batman) and leads directly into ""Infinite Crisis."" The multiple writers and artists here make for an uneven but enjoyable collection that every DC fan needs to read."
4,"Few easy songs, many difficult ones.","I got this to get some more songs in my repertoire. I know some Flamenco techniques/styles such as Rumba, Rasgueos, and Tremolo, along with some knowledge for the Phrygian mode. For one, this book does NOT teach you any techniques. You're on your own. Juan just plays the song, the tablature is in the book, and you learn from there. There are some good sounding, relatively easy songs, but man, there is a lot of advanced stuff in here. In Grade 0, you already need to know AMI rasgueos. Let me put it this way, if you can play every track in here with the speed, precision, and feeling as Juan Martin can, you are one seriously good guitarist. That's my opinion at least. In summation, this is not for beginners."
4,Great presentation,The DVD is like a presentation / demo with great explanation on the background and terminology of Flamenco. The tablatures are very accurate. I wish there was more instruction on the proper forms for the left and right hand.
5,Juan Martin's Method,"Very good method. Although it does not teaches how to do ""rasqueo"", ""tresillos"", ""golpes"" & ""picados"" (vital component for the more advanced pieces), it should give the student a basic understanding of the tempo flamenco style. Again for anything beyond level 0, those techniques are required!"
5,Juan Martin's Books are Great!,"Vol. 1 and 2 are great, especially for the self-educated guitarist. The DVD's are clear and easy to follow. The pieces are fun to learn and play."
5,MURDER MYSTERY,"I really liked this book. Great reading and when I'm not able to guess the killer, I think it's really wonderful. Would recommend this book to anyone, together with The Night Before, the first book in the two book series."
2,Not for me!,"I'm hooked on murder mystery books and thought I might like this one, sadly it fell short. I did not like the lead characters at all. I didn't like most of the characters actually and the dialogue was grating on my nerves! The author went overboard with the cliches. Nikki (main character) came across as rude, pushy, flaky and boring. I listened to the audiobook and I didn't like the narrator, that might have contributed to my exacerbation with the book. I kept with it only because I was curious to see who the murdered was, and it kept me listening to something while I finished my chores. I cannot count the times I rolled up my eyes at what they were saying, I even shouted ""shut up!"" to the characters quite a few times! This author is not for me unfortunately."
3,"Long, and Slow Moving Story",I don't know why this book had to be 450 pages long. I struggled to get into the story. Nothing captured my interest for a very long time. The last 200 pages were decent. At least more was finally happening in the story. The characters weren't that interesting.I have read several Jackson books. They are all too long. I think she could improve the content if she condensed the story.
2,Pretty good,"This book had a lot of suspensful moments, but not enough to make it a great suspense mystery. The heroine was a newspaper reporter and it seemed as if the author really wanted to bash the media. Reed, the cop, was interesting. Serial killings were over the top. Enough already!!! I really didnt care for the main characters overmuch.Dont think I will try another Lisa Jackson book."
3,Reviews by Nan Kilar and Bobby Miller,"Women are being buried alive...in coffins with decomposing bodies. Savannah police detective Pierce Reed receives notes from the killer--they're in the coffins of the long ago/very recently deceased, his office snail mail and his email. Savannah Sentinel reporter, Nikki Gillette, receives notes as well--on her windshield, under her pillow and in her office email. Why are these two targeted? Eventually everyone figures they know who's doing the killing and why. If you have your thinking cap on when you read this, you'll know who's doing the killings.This is a fairly quick read. However, the author has Nikki working the Grave Robber story and trying desparately to get an interview with Reed...which she's been after for years. She wants the big story that will get her to a major newspaper. Reed is notoriously tight-lipped and hates all reporters. And all of a sudden they're lovey-dovey???? Yeah, it's fiction....."
3,SOFASAVE,"The murder plots were fine, but it was the lack of any sex between the two main characters that killed this book for me.A few phrases ""rock hard"", tight ass, fiery green eyes, and TWO kisses between Nikki and Pierce didn't cut it. The serial killer ""The Grave Robber"" was given more thoughts of sex than the journalist and the cop."
1,Something Missing,"This book was terrible. The lead characters were so bad that I actually thought Morrisette was the best character in the book. Nikki came across as a whining busy body. Reed was all right, easier to take than Nikki, but not that good either and the killer was just boring. The book was missing something for me and it left too many questions. Wished I would have skipped this one."
1,Astonishingly bad ...,"This is a terrible book. There are several problems I had with it:1) Way too many characters -- and they are virtually indistinguishable in tone and voice. Not only that, I never became attached or interested in any one of them.2) The book uses, inexpertly at that, every single cliche in this genre -- amnesia, serial killer at large, etc. I could add a few more -- but don't want to spoil it for anyone.3) I could see the ""surprises"" in the book coming a mile away. There was nothing at all that I didn't see coming.4) The romance aspect, perhaps because of the vast number of characters, was unconvincing and downright creepy. Again, can't say more without spoilers.This book barely held my interest. I would not recommend it to anyone."
3,Uneven but Beautiful (3.5 stars),"I would recommend this album but not as one that I listen to straight through. I found it to pretty even - on some songs it seems like the vocals and music just don't seem to mesh in enough to make powerful music (like Clark Gable). Also, as was pointed out in another review, though the chorus is catchy, the lyrics in Sleeping In seems somewhat cheesey and forced. However, the album is filled with enough gorgeous pop songs to make it worth. It's strongest tracks include The District Sleeps Alone Tonight, Recycled Air, Brand New Colony."
5,excellent.,"i was first a fan of death cab for cutie, the lead singer ben gibbard's other band, when a friend introduced me to the postal service. iw asn't sure if i would enjoy the more techno, less indie, sound, but i fell in love with this album and has been my favorite since i bought it when it was first released. definetly their best work. i highly reccomend this to anyone who enjoys good music, and is willing to give a different sound a chance. the first, second, and third time through may sound too different for your taste but i am confident that you will come to enjoy it as much as i have."
4,from good to AMAZING,"""Such Great Heights"" is an amazing, perfect song. The first time I listened to it, I fell in love... and everyone I played it for immediately fell in love with me...If you like, Flaming Lips, King of Convenience, Mansun, or Pulp, this is a garunteed must have.i expect more great things..."
4,well worth checking out,"i'm a casual fan of d.c.f.c., but not necessarily electronica/ambient or whatever you'd call what dntel does. however, this album works wonderfully, in much the same way that the american analog set's 'updates ep' did. i'd say the only real clunker is track 3, which may have some of the goofiest lyrics this side of billy joel's ""we didn't start the fire."" other than that, i'd highly recommend it."
4,Great,"A great cd filled with eletronic extacy. It is what is new and original, soaring vocals of DCFC's Ben G, and a wild attack of drum machines, and synth basses."
5,Amazing to listen to while high...,"...on an airplane, I mean. The first three songs are an amazing triumervate. More soul searching than anything Death Cab for Cutie has put out so far."
2,"They Wish They Where, ""THE ANNIVERSARY""","First off this is not a great album by any means. Yes, greatly produced but it seems WAY to fake. I absolutley hate when albums are controlled by the engineers who make it sound as if zombies are playing music. Any body can have this sound with a great engineer and little experience with insturments(BAND). The electronic beats with indie music has been done. Please try the ""ANNIVERSARY"" for more heart felt lyrics and just plain better electro-pop. The Anniversary has the most heart felt lyrics that are genious.Just cause wherer i live the postal service is number 1 on the radio deosn't mean its good music. You guys are like corporate zombies walking in straight lines following one another. WAKE UP get some good music.Who is more foolish? The fool or the fool who follows?"
3,Wavering Depth,"Listening to Postal Service's ""Give Up"" is a bit like swimming in a pool in which the depth is constantly shifting from shallow to abyssal. At times songs like ""The District Sleeps Alone Tonight"" and ""Nothing Better"" make the album feel sonorous, original and satisfying, but the electronic beeps and blips, as well as the purposely abstract lyrics, fade away as a gimmick on many of the other songs. As a result, the album is interesting to listen to, but generally shallow. A few of the songs are catchy or worthwhile, but overall the album has little replayability over time. Like the beeps and blips, the album itself is, in the end, a gimmick."
5,Euphoria,"This is the album that I needed at this point in my life. Things not going so well right now, this album became my Prozac.The best way I could describe Postal Service's music is that it is sheer euphoria.It's poppy, the lyrics are lighthearted compared to my Radiohead-heavy album collection, but I find their music beautiful.Remember the feeling that you got in your stomach when you were eight, and the bell would ring right before recess? That's what this album does for me."
5,Loving it.,"I've always liked DCFC but found them a bit morose. The album boasts intelligent, glittering detail and infectious melody."
5,Get your dancing shoes,"First of all, this is the first album in quite a while id say is worthy of 5*s. This album is original and exactly what mainstream music needs (or maybe its better nobody knows). After rap-metal, boy bands, retro garage rock, and wanna-be creed singers, this album is the breath of fresh air after being held under water for five minutes. modern elektronica mixed with an 80's new-wave sound and the familiar indie rock melodies from death cab for cutie make this album sure to please just about everyone. im just curious as to whether the live show will be able to capture the fun carried on the album. if so, i have a feeling there may be a new musical trend on the way and the postal service just may be the catylist."
5,Great Album,"This is just a good album. There are some standout tracks, definitely, but the whole thing is so listenable. I downloaded some tracks from amazon's mp3 store before deciding to buy the CD-- if you have a pretty high quality stereo, I recommend it. The difference is there.Also, I tried to find some info out about where they recorded it and the synths used-- I think I hear and SID synth in there, is that right? Such a great mix of sounds."
2,Lol at their theory on Kennedy,"Sleeping in... because they want to be ignorant of Cuba's involvement? The apparent truth does seem to look bad for the US, this feels like propaganda."
3,Dancefloor detachment,"3 1/2One of few effective electronic-indie collaborations, GU is an effectively solid piece of emo boogie, somewhat hampered nonetheless from limited but appealing production."
4,awesome cd,"i normally don't listen to the genres of music postal service falls into (i guess it's electropop and sort of emo). i mainly listen to hip hop (del the funkee homosapien, madlib, atmosphere, latyrx, etc.) and very few groups/bands/artists of other genres. after a friend who was a huge fan recommended it to me, i went out and got the cd and really loved it (well the first 2/3 of it anyway...i usually pop another cd in after clark gable, the rest just got boring, hehe). just about every song up to and including clark gable sounds pretty good, except recycled air...that one bores me.i'd recommend it to anyone hoping they'd give it a chance. the lyrics and the vocals just sound so good. the vocals and the synth beats also compliment each other so well."
2,Good music marred by bad production and iffy lyrics,"*Give Up* is very appealing the first few times one listens to it. Much of the music is pretty good, but the album suffers from uneven lyrics, uninspired instrumentals and bad mastering.Ben Gibbard's lyrics sometimes work very well, but frequently make me wince:""I'm feeling green / like teenage lovers between the sheets.""""Nothing Better,"" starts with a neat line but then turns into a silly emo mess. The vocals are a kind of annoying whiney monotone and have a emotionally vacant quality that matches the cheap synths a bit too well.The most serious problem with this album is the production. The tracks are insanely overcompressed, and there is almost no dynamic range or variation in the instrument levels. The sound has no presence and the Game Boy/Casio keyboard synth loops get very old very fast."
5,:),"youll love it - trust me - if not the whole thing, then some of its more brilliant moments for sure."
3,Pretty Good. B+,"It has a lot going for it--its catchy, is in a pretty unusual emotional environment sounding naive and melancholy at the same time, which is refreshing. That said, this certainly isn't the most original thing in the world, either... having listened to lots of Aphex Twin and IDM type stuff this just seems kinda like trickle-down mash-up which frankly, isn't as good, either. The orchestration is almost always cluttered with too much of the little soft fast beats. There are exceptions here, mostly ""Such Great Heights"" which is probably the most refined and interesting melodically as well and has more staying power than most of the rest of the songs.Also, being the nerd that I am, I couldn't help but laugh when a little clip from Mahler's 6th symphony made its way into ""We Will Become Silhouettes"". It has its purpose in the song, so I'm not really complaining, but it did make me think about how much better an orchestrator Mahler was..."
3,Postal Service's Service not up to Par...,"I went out and bought this album, anticipating that it would be a fantastic album. However, I was disappointed by the actual content. Uninspired vocals, bubble-gummy pop synth lines, and pretty sappy lyrics, this band (is it a guy and a girl?) was not exactly what I was hoping for. The songs seem to drag on & re-use material from just a couple of tracks before. I had first heard the band on a Sundance movie trailer and thought that they sounded pretty cool and laid back - but after buying the record, it seemed that they were too laid back & the mere 10 tracks were too much. They have potential, but it isn't really being used."
3,This album is so close to amazing,"This album has 2 amazingly great songs: The District Sleeps Alone Tonight, Such Great Hights. Other songs that are notable are Nothing better and Recycled Air. These songs are very original and have very great beats and lyrics. I think everyone should hear The District Sleeps Alone Tonight-- it is amazing. The other songs are uninspired and dont really hit the mark. If they just put a little exrta time and effort this cd would be perfect. But I think everyone should hear what this has to offer, if you like techno or not. If you dont like emo then dont buy it. But if you scroll above, Amazon offers this CD w/ Translantism, a very great combonation, buy that!"
3,Bleeping and Blipping into Oblivion...,"This album struck me right off the bat as something special. Indie rock, garage rock, etc. has for years thrived off the pulse of guitars and drums and blood and sweat. What the Postal Service represents is a new breed that redefines the notion of what a ""band"" is.The Postal Service harkens back to the electronic sounds of groups like OMD and New Order. Replacing that experimentation is a keen sense of melody and lyrical sensitivity. The Postal Service approach their sound as something to create songs with, not something to merely make noise with.It is their lack of experimentation that keeps this album from being a classic, however, though what they are doing is something worthwhile: picking up the synthesizers and playing them with heart. Given some more development, a group like this can be truly dangerous. For now, we can close our eyes and feel the sadness of ""The District Sleeps Tonight"" or ""Sleeping In"" and say YES."
5,The Most Important Record of 2003,"I've had this album in heavy rotation for months.My friend introduced me to these guys saying that they reminded him of Radiohead. Although I'm a HUGE Radiohead fan, I don't see much of a connection between the two groups.With Postal Service, the music is catchy pop-rock covered in a thick blanket of electronica (think Ladytron with a touch of Grandaddy, or visa versa) and the vocals remind me of Erasure a bit.Very clever lyrics and beats that get under your skin. It's one of those albums where you keep finding a new favorite song.Buy it."
2,the singer isn't cool,"the singing is too horribly imperfect, it destroys the otherwise beautiful album. go buy light yourself on fire by stars. It's very similair, but they can sing."
1,Please Return to Sender,"This girl I was dating listened to the Postal Service, she thought they were a pretty cool band. What's interesting, I told her they have this indie-rock sound about them; an old eighties/early nineties sound. As one of the other reviewers mentioned, they're this indie-electro band--much like Depeche Mode, New Order, OMD, and the Pet Shop Boys--riding a wave of unparalleled success, in the dynamic electronic-underground music scene. If it weren't for the uninspiring vocals on this unimpressive CD, it would've ended up in people's mailboxes all over the world. Unfortunately, the unwilling participants are led to believe this band has any merit, in the unbelievably craptastic way it's put together: It sounds arbitrary, if not ridiculous, as if though some teenage kids got together after school in their garage, hoping someone out there would notice their broad vocal range in some of the songs. It's stripped of any value as far as I'm concerned."
2,Excuse me while I kill myself.,"Listen to M83, Depeche Mode, and New Order.Hell, even Air.This is the most pretentious and dull electro-indie I've ever heard."
1,"Sorry, I tried","I listened to this CD various times in broken parts and then once from start to finish all the way. I found it to be extremely irritating. I'm sorry, I just don't get it. The Postal Service is not for me. It has nothing that I look for in music. My tastes are a lot different than the other people who reviewed, so take your pick..... It just sounds like a seventeen year old kid who got dumped by his girlfriend and now he's using his PC and Nintendo to make cute music for little girls to dance to. Why anyone would wanna buy this album is beyond me."
1,um...,"The beats are ok, but dated already... the lyrics are sappy and bad. Good for the high school crowd though who have heard nothing better. Melodies are pretty poor.To the reviewer who said ""Shoot me in the head if I ever find better music than this, please. ""You need to seriously expand your horizons. I could name about 50 bands that are eons beyond this stuff. You can start with My Bloody Valentine."
1,oh,"I love the song Such great heights, but the rest of the album sounds like a cartoon or tetris is being played. It's gets stupid and the lyrics aren't good."
3,Emoclash?,"If you are a fan of electronica (Aphex Twin, Photek, that kinda stuff) forget it, you're not gonna like this album. The samples are disappointing for Photek fans. Emo fans get a slight thrill off of the beats and are happy with the lyrics and singing. Overall, the album has some songs that I really like and some that are kind of bland. You can't say this is emo because of the lack of guitars etc. but you can't say its techno because of the lack of sufficient beats and samples."
3,Ehhh.,"There's nothing wrong with this record. The electo-pop melodies are good, not great. The vocals are delivered in a detached, bored monotone, a style that has become fashionable this decade. ""Such Great Heights"" and ""The District Sleeps Alone Tonight"" are pretty good pop songs, but here's a guarantee:You buy this record now and you will not have any interest in listening to it in a two or three years. The only way you'll hear any of these songs then is if you're too lazy to update your mp3 player between now and 2010 and one of these tracks pops up on random play mode."
2,Do not buy the hype-KG,"In indie music circles, fans tend to protect the work of their heroes with motherly rabidity, even if it is not entirely justified. Ben Gibbards stab at electronic pop is no different. I was never overly impressed with his efforts in Death Cab for Cutie, but for foot tapping melodic pop, i thought that Death Cab ranged from catchy to merely passable. The Postal Service, on the otherhand, sounds like a man just trying to do something entirely different just for the sake of doing so. His pop sensibilities adapt rather shabbily to electronica and creates a gutless form of techno-pop that seems suitable only for 13 year old school girls who are doped up on pixie-stix. This is indie music at its most tooth-achingly mainstream."
2,"a bit bland, but ok if you have nothing better to listen to","there's a few nice songs on here, but for my money, fans of indie electronic music should go check out the Morr Music label. bands such as Lali Puna, Ms. John Soda, Solvent, Isan, Styrofoam, etc... are making music that's 10 times more emotional & beautiful than this stuff. also you should check out Ulrich Schnauss: ""a strangely isolated place"". perfect shoegazer electronica to blow your little indie mind."
3,Whitetown Reborn,if this is not a rebirth of the Whitetown album Women in Technology i don't know what is. This cd was brought more upt to date and the synthesis was great but the last thing that IDM really needs is pop vocalists. Overall i give it 3 stars for the background.
4,fantastic!,"Great cd. I needed something like this for a long time, fits the bill perfectly.only problem is, out of the mere 10 tracks, there are only 4 or 5 REAL standouts. The rest is just... way too chill.the standouts:-DC Sleeps alone tonight-such great heights-this place is a prison-brand new colony-natural anthem"
4,Attractive & Modern!,"The Postal Service's music is truly different, in that it uses certain sounds and beats not found in your typical 80's retro style, modern indie music. The lyrics definitly make a clear point after thinking about what the song is trying to stress, which for me was towards the end of every song. However, as a trance DJ, I think that the sounds and synths of PS's music should definitly be looked over again. They are awful. I found that they apply too much -6db and -8db on the songs, pretty much on every song. If they could just adjust these specific settings on their songs, it would definitly have a more suitable & pleasing taste for the indie-pop fad.I hope their next album doesnt carry this problem along. It really causes a disgrace in the music."
4,Overall Great Album,"I agree with everybody that this is an extremely interesting and fun album. However, if you are looking for good lyrics, do not buy this album!! Frankly, the lyrics are not their strongpoint, and in my opinion, they ruin a couple of the songs. If you are the type of person, however, that doest not mind bad lyrics, then by all means buy this album. Extremely interesting rythems, electronic sounds, and pretty cool melodies. The District Sleeps Alone Tonight is one of the greatest songs I've ever heard. Such Great Heights, Brand New Colony, and Natural Anthem are completely awesome too."
4,excellent album,"while i'm not really a fan of any of the members of this groups other projects i'm definetely a big fan of this one. it's very different from anything emo or emo related the brand name corporate america has decided to give that type of music but it definetely experiments with electronica and brings it to a level a lot of musicians in that catagory never achieve. more of a descendent of new order and kraftwerk than the chemical brothers, fatboy slim, etc. will ever hope to be."
5,GO BUY THIS CD!,"Do yourself a HUGE favor and go buy this cd. The Postal Service, hands down, is one of the best cd's I have ever bought in my life. It totally changed me and my views of music and opened the door to another genre of music. I bought Dntel shortly after the purchase of TPS and Dntel is amazing as well. I even bought 2 Deathcab cd's and they are a great band too. This is the only cd, that when it ended with Natural Anthem, I was so disappointed. It was such a good cd, that I was not ready for it to end. Go buy it now!"
5,Best rock/pop album I've heard in 10 years,"This is the best synth-pop type album I have heard since Depeche Mode or Erasure. Hell, this album even beats some of these guys later albums. Radiohead's Kid A album delved into this shared territory where pop meets electronic in 2000. Their album was rough, sharp, and sometimes over the top. Postal Service has entered this same territory with smooth, flowing beats and soft gentle lyrics. Thanks for not beating me over the head with it, guys.Ever seen the episode of ""That 70's Show"" where they show the future and Fez has discovered Flock of Seagulls and is dressing like them and playing the keyboard? That's how I feel. It's like I have seen the future and am excited to be part of it."
3,Going Postal,"I was intrigued upon the first listening. The sort of ""techno"" sound quality coupled with the casual, ""average guy""-type vocals and the conversational lyrics were a little unusual. So I bought the CD. The style is maintained throughout but becomes a little tiresome as it goes along. The production is terrific, the composition fairly strong but the vocals seem uninspired and a little too pedestrian. The lyrics are good conversations but are somewhat aimless.To their credit, they have a unique sound that is refreshing but is not one that will stand up over time. Better than most but somewhat below the truly great."
5,Three Cheers,"The Postal Sevice. Most people know them, whether it be from the superstardom of Ben Gibbard, the genious music of Jimmy Tamborello (DNTEL, Figurine, ect.) Iron and Wine's cover of Such Great Heights featured on Garden State, among other reasons. The Postal Service, as already mentioned, is composed of Ben Gibbard (Death Cab for Cutie) and Jimmy Tamborello (DNTEL). Give Up, The Postal Service's first (and most likely only) album is one great pop record. Beautifully crafted electro-pop with stellar vocals from the great Gibbard. Melancholy, yet happy. Give Up is great. A must for fans of indie, electronica, or just great pop music."
5,Soothing and Relieving,"I love all types of music with grunge alternative topping the list. With all of the garbage out there right now, this CD was a relief. I first heard District Sleeps Alone at Night on launch. I was at work and it popped up and it sounded good so I made it a favorite. I then heard another couple of songs by them and decided to go ahead and order. This CD is an excellent mix of electronica/techno. It's tunes make me feel like I'm floating in the sky. It makes me want stop what I'm doing and just get up and move my body while my eyes are closed so that I can just get lost in the euphoria of it's sound. It makes me forget everything else and just enjoy the moment. It's not too loud, not too soft. Mellow, yet makes you want to get up and dance. I suggest this CD to everyone. Especially those liking Electronica, techno, or industry music."
5,Karma,This is without a doubt one of the most brilliant albums to have graced this new musical generation. Their almost biblical simplicity and sound is well deserved karmic retribution for the abundance of crap which has been thrown at us from every direction. This is truely beautiful.
5,Exceeding All Expectations,"This record is one of the premier albums in any genre currently available. The way the songs are put together are masterful, as the vocals compliment the beats flawlessly. Pop hooks, melodic beats and well written lyrics make this an enjoyable listen the entire way through. The songs ""Sleeping In"", ""Such Great Things"" and ""The District Sleeps Alone"" are the highlights of the record as all three tracks accent the different stylings of the Postal Service most distinctly. Get this record, show it to your friends, co workers, fellow students, peers and anyone else who might have lived in the 80's. They will admire and appreciate the creativity within it, and more than likely you'll be able to catch them in the near future nodding their heads to the catchy hooks of the Postal Service."
1,When will it stop??,Another reviewer had it right... This is 80's Nintendomusic with mediocre vocals. Just ashamed. Why do peoplelike such cheese? Don't people have any taste at all??
1,BAD MUSIC!!!!,This music is worse than Kenny G. and Michael Bolton put together. I'm surprised this is actually considered music. This is an embarassment to Postal Services across the world. This is like listening to a CD that has been scratched up by a jackhammer. Theres nothing anybody can do to make this music better. When I hear this music playing it makes me want to throw up in my mouth.
1,Excellent movie!!,"Hello there:So I heard this album when it was initially released a couple of years ago and I thought that it was ok. Certainly nothing to write home about. I noticed that a bunch of 15 year old girls really liked it, but then again, their taste was pretty questionable considering that the latest Peaches and Tori Amos records were also in heavy rotation.For a much better new release, check out the latest Cam'ron LP, ""Purple Haze"""
1,bo---ring,"I bought this album based on the appeal of the radio single (""such great heights"") but found the rest of the album to be trite AND uninteresting musically."
1,Not good,"You have to admire Worlds Greatest Air Guitarists brutal honesty when he says ""Thi5 band really sucks, and I'm not just saying that. Only an old Backstreet Boys Teen Bopper would like this."" It was what we were all thinking wasn't it?"
5,I got my friend hooked...,"and now he's absoulutely in love. i just kindof downloaded a song because i'd never heard them before and i become so addicted. i put it on a cd for him and he got so addicted to. we went to the only local record store and got the cd. it's the only one that plays in his car and the only one in my discman.it's awesome. it's kindof a weird type of music (i call it lame techno) but it's NOT techno. i haven't a clue what to call it, but its good. except for the weird noises you hear every once in a while that sort of sound like a nintendo or something. by the way, anyone who isn't sure about this album, just listen to district sleeps alone tonight. thats got to be my fav."
2,"the first song's super great, but...",...the rest is a total let-down. The singer is very cheesy and pretentious. There are cringe-worthy lyrics in nearly every track. Too bad it all isn't as good as the first song.
5,Pure electronic genius,I have to admit that when I first heard of The Postal Service the whole electronica part sort of turned me away. But I decicded to keep an open mind. A few downloads later and I couldn't wait to get a copy of the cd. Theres not much to say except that the breezy melodic beats perfectly showcase Ben Gibbard's amazing vocals.
5,Postal Service Knows Music,"Listen to this album...not only is it incredible, but its also inspiring. The Postal Service has discovered how to put depth back into the shallow pop melodies of today's oversaturated corporate market by reinventing a style of subtle techno beats laced with enchanting lyrics that have a story telling fantasy to them while still retaining a semi-conscious style of poetic realism, and separation from the listener, keeping us at a comfortable distance, in a bubble with our own fears and desires while exposing themselves--the artists--to the vulnerability that honesty in an art tends to bring; along with the depth and trust developed in the lyrics and melodies that makes a room filled with the vibrations from this CD seem distanced from an exterior world of chaotic misunderstandings and artificiality. Listen to this album..."
5,Refreshingly different...,"It's hard to find something to compare this album to. The closest thing I can think of as comparison is the synth pop of the 80's, but it's not quite the same. This is a lot cleaner, more organized in its composition. It's really experimental, soothing, energetic, fun & whimsical at the same time. The lyrics have a poetic quality that didn't strike me at first, but the more I listen the more I love it. give it a listen, it's worth it."
4,80's synth pop returns!,"The Postal Service combines the ambient energy of Fischerspooner (or the more palatable beats from Squarepusher) with intelligible, quirky lyrics. At times sounding like Belle and Sebastian in terms of the ennui-soaked bourgeois sentiment of lost love, regrettable folly, and unrecapturable happiness, The Postal Service delivers a fresh breath of electronica. ""Nothing Better"" and ""Brand New Colony"" stand out as keepers produced by these up-tempo synth dreamers."
4,Best album I bought in a while!!,"First I should say that I am a big fan of Death Cab for Cutie, and I love electronic influenced music. So, it was a pretty natural progression for me to find this album. This is an AMAZING album. Ben and Jimmy worked together on Dntel's album, Life is full of Possiblities. I guess they realized how great their colaboration was. Ben's lyrics tell such amazing stories that seem to be taken right from my life. Every track is wonderful and I never find myself wanting to skip any of them. It is a solid listen from start to finish. You even get a couple tracks with the amazing JEN WOOD singing background vocals!!!!This album has been playing constantly in my car, in my apartment, and on my iPod. A HIGH recommendation!"
5,The way you move me,"Arguably the best album of the millennia. Listening to it makes you cherish where you are and who you are with.This Place is a Prison (SLEEPER!!)- The first half separates from the Second bringing in an intrepid drum-beat. Many people have already experience how amazing it is to SLEEP to. Try it, you owe it to yourself."
5,This CD Needs No Catchy Title...,"Wow. Regardless of your musical preferences (or lack of musical appreciation thereof), you are on this page and if you do not own a copy of this CD then you MUST buy one. If you fail to do this, you will be passing up (in my opinion) one of the best albums of the last decade or two (thats about as long as I've been alive which is the only thing keeping me from saying ""ever""). It really is THAT good.The music itself is devilishly melodical in a modern and infectious way. I would describe it as a fusion of traditional backdrops (pianos, guitars, etc), superficially emanating beats of various electronic synthesizers, and appropriately soothing vocals. The result is a feeling of enveloping euphoric goodness that flows through you rather than simply playing around you. Trust me, you'll get addicted.Enjoy :)."
4,"Immediately uninteresting, gradually enticing.","Initially what I heard on this record were simplistic vocals, a string of non sequiturs, layered onto the slowed droning of a DnB loop with staccato snares eminating from each track with the regularity of senior citizens after their morning prunes.While I would never reconcile with several tracks on this album, ones that I still find monotonous to listen to, more than half of the songs on this record are some of the most unassumingly beautiful tracks I have ever come across. The addition of female vocals on several songs, particularly ""Nothing Better"", was genius.Four stars because while the album still does reach a boring lull in the middle (ie/Clark Gable, Recylced Air), the first four and final three tracks are all remarkable in their own right."
5,How Could You Rate This Any Lower Than Five Stars?,"This is one of my top five all-time favorite albums. It's simply awesome from start to finish, which doesn't always happen with albums. The District Sleeps Alone Tonight is one of those songs you can repeat to yourself constantly and it's always good, I love it. From there it's purely superb, Such Great Heights, Sleeping In, Nothing Better--they're all good. So if you haven't bought this cd, you're missing out on pure musical genius. And so buy it RIGHT NOW, I beg of you."
2,this is nt a good compact disk,sounds like detah cab for cutie rip offthey should call this group postal service - it sounds like they did this comapct disk through the mail and it was sitting in the post office when a guy whent postallamewhats it even?
3,Four songs don't make up an album: stick to Death Cab for Cutie,"While I find this musical experiment resulting from collaboration over mail to be interesting, I've only found a handful of songs that I would consider memorable on it. There's too much of a conscious effort to have an 80s sound on it, making it too artificial at times, in spite of the great melodies and lyrical work that Ben Gibbard typically delivers.The most notable songs in the album, besides the classic ""Such Great Heights"" (perhaps one of the best songs in 2003), contain contributions from Rilo Kiley's Jenny Lewis (i.e. the opening track and ""This Place Is A Prison""). Also well worth listening is the mostly instrumental and progressive electronic track closing the album. But four songs don't make up an album. I give it three stars. I stick to Death Cab for Cutie for now."
1,I Gave Up,"I picked up this CD when I read an interview with Ben Gibbard mentioning that this CD outsold all the DCFC records combined before ""Plans"". I thought I missed something given that I really like all the DCFC stuff before ""Plans"". I didn't. This is just electronica dribble and not very interesting, actually blaned would be an improvement.DCFC continues to soar and can really hit the ball out of the park on some tunes, but honestly ""Plans"" which set them on the path to über status is my least favorite DCFC effort. I don't like it at all and if that along with this Postal Service work is what sells then I hope Ben Gibbard falls flat on his commercial appeal, because that will be one damn record I will enjoy."
3,When did Kajagoogoo get back together???,"Tell you what, folks, the first time I ever heard the song ""Such Great Heights,"" I'm not kidding, I thought Kajagoogoo had reformed to make a new album. Everything here is vintage, updated Kajagoogoo for 2004, with classic lead frontman Limahl back at the helm. Sad thing is, it's not Kajagoogoo, but rather, the weak Postal Service, who do a bad Kajagoogoo imitation. Save for ""Such Great Heights,"" this record comes nowhere near Kaja's 1982 classic, ""White Feathers."" Postal Service even went so far as to rip off the classic '80s ten-song format on their record. Oh well, what can you do? For true synth rock, check out White Feathers by Kajagoogoo, or any of the first three Duran Duran studio albums.On a personal note, this is my 200th record review, so I'm very honored for the support of everybody. THANKS FOR EVERYTHING!!!!"
2,Boring and repetitive,"I've got that CD because I read good reviews about it. But I'm really disapointed. This album is very repetiive and brings nothing new to the music panorama. All the CD is a continuation of New Order's or Pet shop boys music and doesn't introduce anything new to that kind of music. With this CD Pstal Service shows little imagination and just follows the road opened by others before.The tracks are very similar, there aren't too much changes between them. Looks if they used a template to perform the music.The recording is also poor, in a good stereo system the music lacks presence and everything sounds the same. The drums have the same size as as a guitar and in the reallity that dosen't happen."
4,nintendo,"take the electronic genius of DNTEL's Jimmy T. and the voice of death cab for cutie's Ben G. and you get the postal service.The songs on here are great and very electronic and dancy. It has this huge 80's feel and you can hear a little NEW ORDER, or NO DOUBT's current single. Lots of bleeps and blips. This is starting a whole new genre of music, LABTOP POP. 80's house with indie rocking.A big complaint is the lame whiny vocals. They are very catchy but at the same time they are very whiny and they scream teenybopper. you know that typical whiny emo sound that is so sugary sweet that by the last track you'll have to check your teeth for cavities. its only a matter of months before every get up kid, dashboard confessional loving 15 year old puts these song on a mix cd for their love intrest.that is just how good the songs are though. too good to stay underground."
3,This is the problem with this CD,"My feelings about this album approach the very definition of paradox. I find the music itself dull and rather arrogant in its simplicity. The lyrics are dry and loveable. The songs on this album feel like back up songs for recent Death Cab album. The songs just didn't have enough concrete imagery...""well since their already outlined we'll just make a side project."" It's really odd..I don't undestand this ""resurgance"" of Indie Pop, I'd rather the Cure put out an album in line with Killing and Arab, but that won't ever happen. The Postal Service.. I must admit it's great for soothing my 8 week old son, but it just makes me want to scoop out my heart with cracking fingernails..it's just that loveable and poppy. It's particularly odd really, I don't like this band but for some reason I just can't stop playing it. Damn the Pop gods!! I think i'm going to mix this CD with a Godspeed's newest album.. maybe that will satisfy my ""whatever"" mood.."
4,Better everytime I listen,"Everytime I listen to this album I enjoy it. It is good on so many levels for me. Music, Singing, lyrics all are very good. They have the talent to be great."
4,Keeping it simple- mostly,"The skittering beats and almost retro-video-game-like sounds on these songs might make you think that this record sounds trite, or unlistenable, or maybe even borderline ridiculous, but its the opposite of all these things. Ben Gibbard has penned some of his best, most personal lyrics ever for this album, and has firmly established himself as one of my all-time favorite songwriters. This is simply one of those records thats as deep as your imagination but is completely accessable the first time you hear it, much like U2 albums used to be. Strongly recommended for DCfC fans, or people who simply like solid, emotional music, or for anyone who happens to be breathing."
5,Spillane gets the groove on,"This is a great album! Spillane mixes some traditional Celtic tunes with new jazzy, new age sounds. He does a lot of remixing, with him playing the low whistle and uileean pipes at the same time. This is kind of quirky, but sounds great. Lots of songs have a free-flowing, magically haunting Celtic hint that only Davy could create. A CD definitely worth buying if you like Celtic/New Age/Good Music."
2,Not squeezable or very small,"The only reason to buy this mouse is for the picture stamped on it. The ""squeeze anywhere"" is an outright lie.I bought this for my child because it was supposed to be smaller (for their smaller hands) and it claims ""Squeeze my head anywhere and I will click!"". Well, it is a bit smaller, but you can find many mice for laptop computers that are this size or smaller. The mouse I already have is the same width and only a little bit longer. I don't know where they get away with saying squeeze anywhere because this is just an ordinary mouse with regular buttons. If you don't press the buttons it won't click. You can't even press or squeeze the buttons sideways.It doesn't feel very durable either. There is a lot of play in the buttons which seems to be just waiting for a button to snap off. Especially if you squeeze sideways."
1,Ernie Optical Mouse,I still haven't been able to get the mouse to accept only clicks on one button but I am sure it is me and how I installed the software to make that happen. I think it prompts you to overwrite existing dlls pertaining to the mouse - which makes me nervous - so I haven't accepted...
5,LET IT......RIP!!!!!!!!!!!!,"When my friend came over and we played i thought""this game is a piece of crap!""But then we played it and played it,and i start to get get the hang of it,then guess what,by that night i bought the game and a stadium and 3 beyblades and now i'm nuts about beyblades!!!This game has no real story which makes it kind of boring.....but watching the beyblades spin and hit and using the cool characters,not to mention unlocking some,is cool.The graphics are absolutely auesome and so is the music,but the thing is,when you hit your opponent,there HP goes down about 10.But when they hit you,your HP goes down by like,20!!!!belive me,i looked.here's what i say:1.if you're obsessed about beyblades(like me)then buy it.2if you like beyblades and you just think it's OK then rent it.3if you hate beyblades whatsoever,then why are you looking at this review!?anyway,...this game...ROCKS!!!LET IT RIP!!!!!!!!!!!!see ya,kenny(remember me)vote yes please."
4,I will never look at Beyblade the same way agian!,This game is brilliant. Here's how I see it:Storyline:(none)Gameplay:7/10Music:3/10Concept:9/10Overall:6.3I love this game. You will too but ONLY if you are a Beyblade fan. Overall I give this game a 6.3/10. A must buy for any Beyblade fan!
2,BORING GAME,"After playing this game for about 4 or 5 days, you start to realize that nothing new is happening!How the Game Works:1. Beyblade in tournaments (It usually takes 30 seconds to win a battle)2. Go to the shop and buy supplies to improve your beyblade3. Beyblade in tournaments4. Go to the shop5. Beyblade in tounramentsTHIS GAME IS BORING AND NOT FUN! YOU SHOULD NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS POORLY MANUFACTURED GAME!"
3,BR and SM review,the graphics in this game is awsome.the battles are enjoyable. the game is lacking depth and unlocking charters is annoying because the time it takes.overall it passes the testp.s.u have 2 be a beyblade fan to enjoy it
3,Great game for multiplayer and for the tournament but....,"Once you beat the tournament once and play the multiplaye several times, the game starts to get repetitive. Though, the game is so cheap that its worth buying."
4,V-force rocks,i do not have information right now but tell you when i get it this sunday. i only seen the game at www.nintendo.co.jp
3,Great for those starting to venture into the world of movies,"This book features many greats, but those who have already been into film for quite some time will definately have seen most of these movies. I'm 14 and I've seen about half of these films, I own a couple others, and I've certainly heard of all of them. Nonetheless, this is a great book for the beginner movie buff."
1,Title Is Misleading in the Extreme,"The casual viewer of Turner Classic Movies who finds Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt a revelation or Wilder's Sunset Boulevard an undiscovered masterpiece will be pleased, but the serious student of film will find no surprises here. All of these films are well known and appreciated in some way by those who truly love motion pictures as an art form rather than something you rent at Blockbuster because you've nothing better to do. The person who refers to a film as a ""great flic"" will be thrilled by the mysterious treasures they find within these pages. However, if you are aware that directors existed before Spielberg and Cameron and that motion pictures once were silent, filmed in black and white, and popular before 1977, then do not disappoint yourself by purchasing this elementary guide for the elementary ""movie fan."""
1,you must be joking,"I am familiar with many of these films andthey have largely fallen through the cracksof time for a good reason, namely THEY SUCK."
4,Great for EDC.,I have carried many knifes and multi tools in the past. But for something that I will always carry this is the tool for me. It is not to bulky on my belt and has a million uses. I never realized how much i used a multi tool until I had this one.
4,Very handy multitool,"The Leatherman Juice S2 is my favorite multitool for EDC use but, the design of its can opener falls well into the, barely usable, category because of its unsharpened, stamped metal design. This product barely missed a five star rating by a mere fraction of an inch but, the size, weight and price point gives it high value for the money spent. I'll probably get another one soon."
3,Good Book,"This book was interesting to me as a future educator. I thought he made some very good points about teachers and address the educational gap between students of color and their peers. I don't think the book was very coherent because it talks about some many different strategies. However, if you are a middle class teacher then it gives you great tips about how to connect with urban students."
2,Reverse Racism,"Although I found a few nuggets in this book, I was horrified at the author's extremist views. I will not recommend this book to the diversity committee at my school."
1,Think twice,"I bought this book because I am a white teacher in a lower-income multicultural school, and I truly value education. Unfortunately, I found one major problem with this book. It states many facts, summarizes other people's work, and tells many anecdotes, but does not seem to offer any well-articulated or helpful new ideas. The only positive aspect of the book is its reference to many other, much more interesting and insightful publications, notably Gloria Ladson-Billings' ""Dreamkeepers"" and Gary Howards' ""We Can't Teach What We Don't Know""."
5,TOP DRAW,A highly critical piece of work highlighting the many unspoken issues within education which crosses geographical bounderies effortlessly!!This book addresses issues which apply to young people and parents regardless of cultural or ethinic origin.Eye opening and truly honest.
3,Meat Eaters are Sexy,This novel describes first contact between humans and a race of alien stone age humanoids with a social structure very similar to honey bees. A worker falls in love with a drone and tries to save him after the queen orders his execution. Clumsy human anthropologists forever change society by introducing metal working to the aliens. Its a fairly diverting read.
4,"Good fiction, for its era","This book is a product of the time in which it was written, during which women were thought of as dependent and in need of direction from males. This comes out very strongly when Iroedh begins to develop into a fertile, mature female and has to learn to play the psychological, war of the sexes-type of ""game"" with her chosen mate, whose chauvinist views are straight out of the '40's and '50's. In spite of its sexism, the book is highly enjoyable as recreational reading and even sheds some light on the Communist panic that swept the nation during the time."
1,everything was poor quality,Wine coaster's center silver piece was loose and rattling in package. Gift wrap very marginal - a piece of minimal paper. Ordered gift card was no where to be found. The coaster does not really look like silver or silver plate. It is very dull almost like pewter. Definitely way over priced ($125). Have now seen better at a third the price.
5,"Good singing, bad Strauss, good flick","Korjus (for whom alone I bought the DVD) was thrilling, better than her CDs I think. Don't really care for the Strausses (with exceptions), but she was a miracle. Good enough acting, actually an interesting story, good music (if you like J. Strauss Jr.). The lyrics by the way were by Hammerstein. He kept repeating his best line - it went, Ahhhhhhhhhhhh! Highly recommended if you like either Korjus or Strauss or both. Oh. And Korjus was a good little actress herself!"
1,The Great Waltz,"VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS DVD...Cover IS IN JAPANESE....Pictures of actors are JAPANESE....Introduction to movie is in Japanese !!!We DON'T EVEN SPEAK JAPANESE...nor do we read JAPANESE...Made in Japan ???Not too happy with this, and the pricewasn't one of the cheaper dvd's either."
4,Great White - Final Cuts,"First, in response to the reviewer down below, Final Cuts are the studio versions of what's on Recover, which is a live album! In conclusion, Recover is a live album and Final Cuts are the studio versions.Secondly, if you like the Great White sound, then you'll like Final Cuts. It's not GW's best material, because these are cover songs, but they've added the Great White sound to them. This is out-of-print, so grab it while you can at a cheap price!"
2,O Jerusalem,Poor acting. Kitchy weak screen play and direction. What a shame for the perfect subject of a heroic historical event with a moral message.
2,"O, Jerusalem","I thought that while the story was very compelling, the acting was pretty average at best, and awkward at times. It seemed more like a cheap, made for TV movie. I really expected to like it more than I did but just didn't find it very engaging."
1,Don't waste your money,"First let me state that the potential of making a good movie out of the material should have been a given. However, the directing, acting and story line were terrible. I could hardly finish watching the movie. Save your money - there are much better movies out there covering Israel."
4,GOOD MOVIE,"i ENJOYED THIS MOVIE, VERY GOOD ACTORSHISTORICAL VALUE, A LOT OF ACTION , TELL OF THE BEGINNING OF ISREAL."
1,"Poor movie, poor sound, poor direction","I agree with Jack Wasson below - it's too bad the film-makers used the title of the truly excellent Collins-LaPierre book because this movie is just sub-par. The sound editor doesn't seem to understand how to make words clear so in the many scenes where groups of people are gathered what they are saying is almost incomprehensible. The director has no idea how to move the movie along because there is no sense of pace. In fact, it is clunky, awkward and amateurish.Glad that I borrowed this from the library at no cost. Not worth watching."
3,"Good, not great","Sutton's book isn't earth-shattering and I sincerely wonder if it would have sold nearly as many copies but for its controversial title. Others have pointed out that it was a better article than book and I'm inclined to agree. Much of the advice is facile, although important as a reminder for those who are ""personality challenged."""
5,Required reading,"I use this book and several of the Sutton yourtube videoclips for my MBA classes. I use it because so often it seems the A-holes have no clue about themselves. If I offer it up as a discussion piece early in the course, the classroom seems to become more civil, reflecting perhaps a group structuring?O would some power the giftie gie usTo see ourselves as others see us!It would from many a blunder free us,And foolish notion.--Robbie Burns"
2,Disappointing,"The book is too casual and too anecdotal to be taken seriously. This was a concept that could have been much more useful. It seems rushed together and hurried to market, like a teenagers research paper that was written the night before it was due."
3,Seemed a bit fluffy.,"Seemed a bit fluffy. I like the idea, but it seemed like there were lots of statistics and hand-waving and not enough how-to."
1,Boring...,This book was too boring to really get into. Started it several times but it just didn't hold my attention and I've never finished it.
4,Important for managers,"OK, there's the polarizing title: you love it or hate it. To his credit, Sutton acknowledges and discusses that slightly offensive vulgarity, and explains how no other word quite captures the personality type he discusses. And, yes, it is used frequently throughout the book. But once past that hurdle, this is a valuable and well thought out book about the many aspects of abusive, demeaning, poisonous people. It is a quick, easy and entertaining read that shows how to identify, deal with, and (frighteningly) avoid becoming everyone's least-favorite person. There is a fascinating chapter about assessing the costs, both psychological and financial, of employing the jerk. I recommend this book for managers, HR staff, and anyone struggling with loutish co-workers. Be warned that you may not like the answers here."
4,Bold launguage,"I wish I would have started reading this book two years ago. I'm currently employed as my school and I honestly believe my superiors are ""A-holes"". I believe I will benefit from this book."
4,A Good Primmer,This book has basic people-management practices and offers fundimantal supervisory tips that every manager should have.
4,A Great Workplace Tool,The book definitely helps you identify and more appropriately respond to the people in your workplace. The stories were amusing and also served as a great reminder of how not to act when dealing with others. A great read and a book that you will refer to frequently.
2,Boring books rehashes itself in every chapter,"This book has about five decent points, all of which the author could have made in 2/3rds of the length. It is poorly written and feels like a series of essays that were simply strung together rather than crafted into a coherent narrative. The same examples are sprinkled repetitively throughout the text without reference to one another, leading the reader to wonder ""haven't I read this somewhere before?"" Generally not worth reading beyond the first couple chapters."
1,Typical attention seeking baby boomer,"Yet another selfish baby boomer sinks basic civility to get our attention. I think we have heard enough from the generation that thinks behaving like a petulant adolescent is a virtue. If he can't take the time to address us like adults, or articulate exactly what he means by 'a**hole' what's the sense in taking advice from him?..and now that he has grabbed our attention, what do we get? fluff. Another article padded into a book, which plenty of examples of unpleasant people at work but little substance how to deal with them, or the unpleasant fact that it's often effective form of management- think of the marines for example and toughening up of mama's boys.Of course with the baby boom generation it's all about me me me and my feelings. Spare me."
1,"is the author just a ""different"" S-hole?","well, the title is very eye catching for sure. content wise, it is sure from S-holes and for S-holes.i do see some of the points from the author. please help us understand you point better.who is the S-hole when your phone bill had numerous billing error? who is the S-hole when people who have the ability to handle the billing problem but is not put in to the workplace? who is the S-hole when innovation at university, the think tank, is slowing to a haul and the rest of the world is getting ahead of ... err you and your team of S-hole. while you are stopping some of the S-holes. who is the S-hole preaching to create a team of S-hole who can't fix the national debt, now it is the size of the entire economy? are you out of your fing mind and who are the liked mind of this S-hole?No let's hug each other and live in the la la land and outsource the jobs to the other kind of S-hole."
5,short delightful book,"Short delightful book that is quite an easy read. One insight that I got after reading is that it is very important to work in companies that care for their employees and to avoid companies known for cut-throat competition and stack ranking. Doing so will avoid you from jerks and help you not become one. A simple way of finding good companies is their rank in the top 100 places to work. The tips to avoid jerks are also handy, we all need them from time to time. I wish most managers get to read this before becoming one, and then from time to time to keep themselves sane and their employees happier and productive."
4,Practical and useful,"A** are all over the place and sometimes within us too. But, this is a book which sheds light on the inveterate A** who pollute the work environment with their plain meanness and selfish attitude, among other things. And this is not just one of the many management babble books. It's grounded in reality, practical, looks at the issue from various perspectives, provides useful and applicable suggestions.Recommended for anyone who had to deal with jerks and A** in the workplace at any point of time and are at their wit's end to figure a way out to deal with it. And as the author mentions, if you are truly tired of living in jerk city - if you don't want to feel like walking down assh* avenue everyday, this book will be a fun and useful read."
3,just states the obvious,"Was hoping for some profound insight (like how to put an end to the behavior). not at all. it tells you what they act like, tells you to avoid them, tells you not to reward them, tells you not to hire them and then at the end you do a questionnaire to see how close you are to becoming like one.total let down ... I wonder if the library takes donations."
5,Practical advice for dealing with toxic business environments,"Book provided realistic examples and practical advise for dealing with, improving, or temporarily tolerating abusive or toxic people."
1,good to have on your desk or shelf...,"can't believe I wasted time reading this book. enticing title, but content is useless, need more words... a b c d e"
3,Entertaining but loses focus,I enjoyed this book. But it seems as if the author spends the first 80% of the book making his point then completely loses his way as the last part seems to refute his entire premise.
5,A great book for anyone with a job.,I think the most interesting thought from the book that I picked up is that one negative interaction with someone takes five positive interactions to counteract.
4,A fun read,"This is a really fun read for anybody who has worked in a large corporation. You get the office politics, the sassy coworkers, the gossip. This book sets things strait and it is a fun read! It will help you get through your day."
2,Not as constructive as i would have hoped,"The idea of putting your foot down in the workplace and having a zero tolerance for jerks drew me to this book. I did find the examples valuable, i felt that much of the book described jerks in detail and the part that was intended to be contructive was either not tangible enough to be acted on or the message got muddled in describing jerks again."
1,I like the concept but not the book,"I ordered and read this with much anticipation - and there is a LOT of talking, but to be honest the free shortened version published online or in WSJ is enough. The author drones on and on about helping companies and individuals who are open to being helped - but little else. WHAT did you say? HOW did you help? I want to read about the ""a-hole motives"" and what his advice was. What were the boundaries and systems in place? You get nothing but babble."
1,Pretty dull really,"This is an account which does not delve enough into the psychology of Nick Leeson personally (as opposed to traders generally) to be interesting, and is too apologetic for the management debacle that was Barings. Skip it. Nick's disingenous account is better. Lefevre's story of about stock operators is better still"
2,Ambient Metal,"Nice try. Nifty electronic riffs. Unfortunately, not so for the grinding, bothersome, pointless guitar abuse. Surpised Steven Wilson would lend his name to this dud. Steven, keep your focus on Porcupine Tree."
1,"Truth be told: Trashy, Cheesy, Annoying","Okay - I have followed the progressive metal scene as much as possible with the best of them. I wore out NO EXIT by Fates Warning (TAPE - yeah a long time ago)...I admit I am more of a metalhead than anything...but I really like bands like Fates Warning, Dream Theater, Evergrey and so on...If you expect Fates Warning or Dream Theater - OSI is not even close. If you expect progressive metal - OSI is not even close. I let a buddy of mine borrow this CD (a huge PHISH fan - yuck). He liked it - that should tell you plenty. A lot of Floydesque music after the first two songs.This CD has a really nice package and quite neat. However not only will the music probably bug you - the lyrics will too. Very VERY political - of course - extremely liberal. There is NO doubt these guys wanted to ""say"" something politcally.A real disappointment all the way around. I overnighted this CD too...I gave it one start because the CD casing itself was nice :) Save your money..."
2,Missing Something,"I love Dream Theater, Spock's Beard, Transatlantic, Porcupine Tree. Am I missing something here with this cd. I was expecting so much more and can't really say anything good about the cd. Someone, let me know. I don't know exactly what I'm suppossed to be listening to. My opinion, the vocals are horrible. The playing might be great but that's as much as I want to say about this one. Guys, don't try another one."
1,Glad I didn't buy it.,"I was thinking of buying this album because of Portnoy, but someone compared the music to that of ""Space Dye vest"". One of DT worst songs. So it must be the sublime mess that the old DT keyboard player contributed (like most of the whole infinity album). The keyboard player must have been the great change to DT since there best album to date has been Metropolist II live scenes."
4,Very ORIGINAL,"Congrats to Kevin Moore for offering and original album. There is no Dream Theater here - maybe some Pink Floydish decorations. I too bought this expecting ""notes"" but was pleasantly surprised. This album can pound your woofers and can make your tweeters sing like a bird. From gentle melodies to balls to the wall guitar riffs. In the poor world of today's music this album is worth the money. The video CD offers an extra bonus."
4,very nice,"I am a huge DT fan, so I was excited about this release. Kevin and Mike back together, with the guitarist from Fates Warning is it? These guys did a very good job together. Like said it has an atmospheric ""Pink Floyd"" feeling to it. The lyrics are very vague, leaving much up to the listener. There isn't much for me to say, I bought it and I love it."
4,Excellent progressive experiment,"Overall, this is a very worthwhile purchase for a fan of any of the bands involved. The vocals are a bit weak and a few of the songs are perhaps underdeveloped, but the overall sound is very enjoyable. Purchasing the limited edition version is highly recommended!"
2,Pretty underwhelming,"2 1/2A prog-rock supergroup in the least obvious sense, O.S.I. was another one of the Dream Theater off-ramps, this time into slightly harder territory with some electronic flourishes which unfortunately all too often reek of second rate Toolisms instead of finding much new to explore."
2,Sorry...but it's not that good....,"I was looking for more shred...The album is moody, gray and what's up with Dan Rather? I turn him off on the T.V., now I have to do it with a CD too... I imho, I think there's too much techie effort to it...it's not techno, just edited on a PC alot. So..? What's the point? Maybe I'm missing it but I don't think so. I was hopeing for more of a Liquid Tension thing and that could be my fault for going into it with a pre-conception and expectation. But, in the end..I just don't really like it. It's like Pink Floyd meets Moby with some chops thrown in."
3,3.5 expected much more,"yea i was kind of dissapointed in this band. yet this album is not half as awful as their new album, but it is still pretty avarage. with these musicians i was expecting much more. but it seems it goes no where. the songs have ALLOT of potental but just dont quite go anywhere.....thank god rudess is in dream theater now. kevin may have destroyed that band with his current infuences."
2,not so good,"Device looks good, however the setup was not intuitive and most functions didnt work. Maybe mine was defective, but it was pretty aggravating for something this simple. Multiple comuters did not recognize the device once connected.. could not get to camera setup, power button requires you to HOLD it until it boot, but if you hold it longer it shuts down. Dont give it to someone who is not tech savvy. I still cannot get the camera (photo) setting to work.rip."
2,just ONE,I guess i should have used my brain and read like i usually do but i only got 1 bubble mailer lol. $5 for that is ridiculous
5,"""Roses are Black Roses for you today""","This CD is totally amazing. Every track is absolutely great. As others have made note of, Icon & The Black Roses' sound in my opinion are right between HIM and Charon. As a whole, Harder than HIM, yet not as heavy as Charon.Through the course of the CD it has a good range with some heavier and some more melodic sounding tracks. I heard ""Crucify Your Love"" and ""Sweetest Emptiness Of Love"" and instantly bought the CD. Now, those two still being amongst my favorite tracks, I personally think ""Black Roses"" is the best on the CD and definitely my favorite.Any fan of HIM, Charon, or rock music in general should certainly own this CD. Import CDs are kind of pricey but this one is worth every cent and then some!"
5,A great YA story about strong friendship vs. high school,"Amelia Whitney is a typical 15-year-old, whose days are filled with friends, teacher complaints and bratty younger siblings -- until she is nearly date-raped. The episode robs Amelia of her self-esteem, especially when she discovers how many people she used to consider her friends are willing to believe the rumors. Although it takes time, Amelia's friends help her to get a little revenge, and more importantly, get her old self back."
5,A landmark,"I never took a course in AI, but I've been reading and rereading this book, with pleasure, since the mid-nineties. This book is deep (as well as broad), tells a coherent story, and is very well-written and amusing. It is much more than a textbook or an encyclopedia; it's two of the smartest people around sharing years of study and reflection on some of the hardest and most interesting questions around.It is not something to grok in a semester or two, and it should not be your only information source on any of the topics included. But if you are interested in AI or any related field, you ought to have it.It is a physically unwieldy book. The next edition ought to be in several volumes, in soft covers, and perhaps printed on bible paper, so that I might read it comfortably in bed."
3,"I Confess, I Wikipedia did a better job explaining some of the concepts...","This was a decent book, but really, I felt the authors took a simple principle and DRAGGED it through the mud until it was no longer simple. A quick search online often found something that was much more consumable and concise."
2,"Good book , Computer Science majors only!","Good coverage of rationality, the structure of agents, search algorithms, and decision trees. However, the book is highly theoretical and mathematical, it would not be appropriate for any business majors. I teach Information Systems in a college, I still use Kurzweil's book because I cannot find anything better suited to our needs."
5,artificial intelligence,the book was in excellent condition.it arrived on time.i am quite happy with the service provided by amazon.hrishi
2,too many examples,"I had to buy this book for my study, but I don't really like it. There are too many examples, which takes a lot of time to read."
4,Good but limited,"This is probably the most up-to-date single textbook introducing Artificial Intelligence. Unfortunately, it presents a limited view of the field by chosing not to cover the vast area of AI that deals with cognitive modeling. The authors are up front about this decision and define AI as the study of agents that act rationally [Preface and Introduction] and specifically choose not to address the schools of thought and ongoing research in AI that consider ""Systems that think like humans"" and ""Systems that act like humans"" [Introduction]. What's covered is done well. Students of AI and other readers will need to augment this text for exposure to the rest of the discipline."
3,TRIVIAL EXAMPLES,"While the substance of the material is definately present, beware the examples! This text is yet another example of how as the difficulty of the material increases, the complexity of the examples given decreases. Be prepared for trivial examples in the chapter and complex questions in the exercises - why are you wasting our time Russell and Norvig??? If you are an instructor thinking of using this book, PLEASE be prepared to create examples OF YOUR OWN. It will not be sufficient to lecture directly from the text. If you are a student taking a class that uses this text, GOOD LUCK! I hope you have a good TA, or a lot of time to waste solving problems without examples."
4,Good from a beginners standpoint.,"As a relative newbie in the Artificial Intelligence scene this book was my first (I must admit I haven't finished reading it yet). It provides a different way to look at the world around you so that you are able to break it down into discrete sections which are easier to transform into whatever computer language you chose. At least in the early chapters it can get bogged down with some math it tries not to lose you too quickly.For a newcomer to the Artificial Inteligence world this is a pretty good book, for more advanced programmers I can't really say (not being one myself)"
3,Comprehensively Extensive,"the book is the most cohesively extensive I have ever read regarding the subject. Although AI is a very broad and evolving discipline, the authors have successfully lay down the foundation of the science and elucidate the important and promising aspects of AI."
5,Stuart J Russell and Aaron Kalvani on Artificial Intelligence,"I read this along with the white papers by Stuart Russell and can say that The Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, or short VUB AI-Lab, was founded in 1983 by Luc Steels and is part of the Computer Science Department,and compares well after reading this book on how to apply both to each other.Over the years, more than hundred researchers have worked at the laboratory. They have built a large number of artificial systems to investigate aspects of intelligence: Aaron Kalvani worked on the knowledge systems, autonomous robots, machine learning systems, natural language processing components, design and implementation tools. This was then applied using Stuarts Theories which advanced the AI Science on to stage two. Facinating reading."
5,Great Broad AI Book,"This book is a great survey of Artificial Intelligence that can be used to look back on no matter how experienced in the subject you become. I continue to find the sections that discuss large data set analysis for automated learning to be very grounding.As a student, I am often tempted to find ways to not purchase textbooks as you only end up using them for a semester but this is definitely one that you should spring for if you plan on doing AI work in the future."
2,"Darlene, Quilt Shop Owner","I think this book is more for children's quilts or use the childish looking patterns for shirt fronts or cute wall hangs. I was disappointed with it. I would like to have the full book these patterns were taken from for my personal libery, when I can afford it.Last year a lady called my shop looking for this book to buy. She asked if I could order it for her. I began looking for it and low and behold I found one copy of e-bay for $375.00. I called the lady back and told her I found her a copy buy she would have to order it herself at that price. Her answer ""Oh, I found that one. I'm looking for somebody who has one and doesn't know the value of the book. Maybe I can talk them into selling it to me, maybe for 10 or 20 dollars.I didn't call her a bad name but I wish she could have read my mind.I'm glad I bought the book for a keep sake but I don't think I will piece anything in it."
5,Very Helpful and Practical,"Topics explored in this book include signal processing, feature extraction, linear and non-linear modelling, temporal models and an array of connectionist learning paradigms. These topics are demanding, particularly mathematically, however I have taken a lot from this book where I have had limited success with others. The authors know a great deal about their subject, which has enabled them to take a holistic approach, which explains fundamentals before building them into powerful solutions. Equations, while frequently cited are explained descriptively and often boxed separately from the main text. Learning is greatly enhanced by the 200 interactive tutorials. The NeuroSolutions software (limited version free) is the best I've seen in terms of the number of architectures and data processing algorithms provided and comes with an excel add in! I searched Amazon long and hard for this book and was not disappointed - it sets a new standard for technical education."
3,"Okay book, not worth the price.","The book covers the topics fairly well. Unfortunately, you won't ever use this book outside of a classroom. It seems like every page either has an illustration, or a box saying ""run simulation 5.17 fom the CD, and here are 3 graphs from that simulation"", or ""Use the Excel plugin on the data from the CD"". I suppose that is useful to those who can't follow the math. I believe it is also what causes the excessive cost of the book.DON'T buy the book if you are looking for ways to include neural networks or machine learning into your existing applications. The book gives you formulas, and a workbench program that (once you figure it out) lets you customize it's own built-in formulas with its own data sets. It is not significantly useful when wanting to write your own adaptive system, nor does it have any significant code samples to learn from. You get the formulas and illustrations, figuring out how to apply them is up to you."
5,Excelente Libro,Muy buen libro y lo mejor es que trae buenos ejemplos los cuales ayudan bastante en el entendimiento de las redes neuronales. Por supuesto es una lectura complementaria a textos más avanzados si es que se quiere ahondar en el tema.
1,Marketing ripoff,"I love this program and I bought the first season on dvd and it is a welcome addition to my SF collection. I did not expect it to be as good as it is due to the fact that the original was so cheesy.Having said all the above I find I am extremely annoyed by the fact they are releasing the second season in two sets. Man, talk about milking the same cow twice!The only way that Fans of the show can combat this corporate greed and show them we are aware of the contempt they apparently have for us is to refuse to buy into this sort of scam.I really wish I could give this no stars at all. The show is great, but I can't say the same for Universal Studios."
5,Excellence Continued,The first half of the second season was just as well written and acted as the first season. Nice twist and cliffhanger at the end (mid-point of the season). I wish that I could say the same about the second half of the season (2.5).
4,battlestar galactica season review by dave alexander,The box set was about what I expected and was consistent with the season #1 box set. I was sort of surprised that the number of disks had been reduced to just 4. I had first thought that only a partial delivery had been made.
5,always keeps you squirming to see the next episode,"Love it, love it, love it. I wish I would have started watching this ten years ago. I would have never thought they could remake a show and make it that original."
3,"Unbelievably good season, but what a gyp","I would give this the higest rating, but the fact that it is only the first part of the 2nd season, and ends on a tremendous cliffhanger made me furious. I would not purchase this DVD, nor any future series, until the entire season was available. Not worth watching and then sitting around forgetting details until the next DVD comes out."
4,"Excellent content, but what a rip-off!","The series easily deserves 5 stars, and I have nothing to add to what has already been said in the detailed reviews. I do find the pricing of the 2.0/2.5 combo an outrageous rip-off though, which is why I removed a star."
2,"Great Show, Bad Box Set","The show is outstanding, but it's a tremendous shame that the box set only contains the first 10 episodes Season 2 and still costs $35.For the price and lack of content, the 2.0 box set deserves a 1 star rating. But the high quality of the DVD transfer means it has at least one redeeming value. Hopefully they won't do this again."
1,Battlestar Galactia Ga-Ga,Just because its reinvasion doesn't make it great I thought Battlestar GalacticaWas to dark of a sci-fi show & too incoherent it made no sense to me what so ever!Thank god there still is the original!
1,WTF!?!?!,"How can they release half a season. Is this even heard of... OMG. Like this is a bunch of crap. I mean believe me, I absolutely love BSG! LOVE IT! It's one of my favorite Sci-Fi series out there...But releasing the 2nd season when it's not even finished, just the first half. Ridiculous! I mean okay the first season was freaking short, but that was because of the whole ""we don't know whether people will like this"" factor. And we have established that people freaking liked the show. SO you don't need to continue to cut us short for the freaking rest of the show's run! Give us the standard 22-24 episode seasons, and RELEASE THEM ALL TOGETHER IN AN ACTUAL ""SEASON"" BOX SET!!!...NOT THIS SEASON 2.0 BULLCRAP!!!Whatever you do don't support them in this lame idea!! you will only encourage them! Hold out 'till the season's full run!!"
1,more black holes in the plot than in the universe itself,"It is quite funny - I wrote a 1-star reveiw on the First season (and saved it) but it does not appear anywhere, even if Amazon counts it written. Looks like they are mostly interested in 4-5 stars needed to sell that worthless series.The plot lines are stupid to the limit. The people act like Italian Puppet theater figurines. Considering that the whole existense of humanity is under peril, the military and civil authorities on the ship are acting like a bunch of hysterical kids whose motto one minute is ""Let's all trust each other till we die"" and the other ""Let's all die before we have to take that difficult and tragic decision"". Being a long time SF fan, I would have never imagined that a SF series could bore half to death.The whole reminded of the painful experience of Jarjabinks (sp?)- loud, senseless and very much irritating. Never stops talking too."
5,Good service.,My opinion is that item arrived expeditiously and in good condition. Keep up the good work.
4,Exceptional science fiction with a caveat,"This has to be the most intense science fiction ever viewed, the music, the acting, the plots, the characters, and the communications style, all intense, all subtle and irreverent, yet deeply and emotionally reaching. However, it would be strongly recommended that this not be presented to children; the drama, the character interplay and the intimacies therein are highly charged, sometimes graphic, sometimes base, and sometimes beautific in nature, but all very mature, if not bordering on the sensually debauched. Although I believe this has to be one of the best choreographed science fiction series of all time, particularly the writing and character interaction, all said, this is one of the most intelligent representations for its Genre."
4,Battlestar Galactica 2006,"It's sad to hear people compare the original with this remake, especially since most of the fans for 2006 probably weren't born or too young for the first version.This newer version is more of a drama with side stories and flashbacks, and def has lots of special effects. Very pretty to look at, but difficult with all the cameras constantly shaking/panning in and out as if they were handheld. it's def up there as one of the best sc-fi shows produced for tv. One should say it's different, not better than the original considering the original was one of the most expensive shows of it's time. i enjoyed both in different ways."
5,Cylon Compassion,If you've watched series one you will be compelled to watch series two. It explores the issues from the perspective of the Cylons. I ended up having more compassion for the Cylons than for human beings. I can't wait for series three!
4,what is going on,"great series,continues to entertain. 1 question --why did they split the season into 2 parts in the u.s., but release the full season- 20 episodes plus extras here in australia???enjoy the season."
2,Great series but half a season?,"Does the comapany releasing this need extra money for Christmas Bonuses? They cant wait a few more months and release the entire 2nd season?Horrible marketing decision.Great show, love the updated show and the cast and the writingt is outstanding but this 1/2 Season is just trying to suck people's money out of their wallets."
4,"I love this show. This DVD is amazing, but I'm giving it a 4 because they're overcharging for just 10 episodes...","But I just had to buy it.Btw, it looks absolutely UNBELIEVABLE with an HDMI DVD player and an HDTV. It's an entirely different experience watching it that way.Until SCIFI CHANNEL goes HD broadcast, you really can't see BSG looking this good unless you buy the DVD."
1,galactica,this never really had much to entertain me in science fiction or space science it just seemed to be dumb. it really seemed more political moviated by some politicies to fit in a unreal world .
1,Ripped off by a great show,A whole half a season for $50!?!?!? Crazy and a rip off. Dont waste your money unless your a hardcore fan. These guys should get a beat down for not making it obvious your only getting half a season on the box and charging full season prices.
4,"Gritty, Dark and Philosophical",Don't buy this unless you plan on getting addicted to this show or are already a junkie. It's beautiful blend of film noir and and a sort of deliberate low tech sci-fi that makes epics like Star Trek and Star Wars look like kid's puppet shows. A great cast and some sturdy writing makes the show get better each season.
2,"Great Show - ""Stick it to the Man"" Marketing",The series continues to get better and better. Dividing up season 2 into two segments with only a $10 price reduction per segment is true evil genius on the part of the marketers. And then they complain about Piracy!5-stars for the show - 0-stars for the marketing - 2.5 stars total (round down) Sorry...bg
3,Battlestar Galactica - Season 2.0,"Skips on Disk 2. Fantastic story, I have seen before. My purchase of a brand new Season 2.0 was disappointing. Skipping; scratches mid way through the season. Too late to return. Disappointed in Amazon."
4,More confusion on 2.0/2.5,"Just to further complicate things, I have just bought this, in the 2.0 cover, clearly saying 2.0, identical in every way, except that it includes all the second series.Would have been 5 stars, except for the fubar way this series was released, and the lack of decent extras (deleted scenes and nothing else).While I'm mentioning deleted scenes, do watch them - i often don't bother but in this case they fill in a LOT of background, especially on Adama/Tigh. The sheer volume of these especially for certain episodes makes me wonder if these were expected to be double eps and this was cut back? Would also explain why the whole series is only 20 eps rather than the more usual 24-26."
3,Local Video Store won this one.,"After Reading the reviews on the wonderful show BSG. I decided to partake in this awesome adventure and buy Season 1. I wrote a 4 star review on that DVD package because it was a good buy for me. I was definitely hooked after seeing Season 1.Unfortunately, when it was time to buy season 2, I couldn't bring myself to pay for Season 2.0 and season 2.5. I felt that if I was able to be a proud owner of BSG Season one Complete for under fifty bucks then I wouldn't mind having BSG Season 2 Complete for around 50 bucks as well.So for brevity, I ended up just watching Season 2 via the local video store as I wait for the price to go down.I know the production cost for BSG is high and Season 2 does have more episodes than season one so I gave my review 3 stars instead of 2.Good Hunting,"
4,Awesome,"Like ususal, the characters are very well developed and the stories and CG is very good. The last episode (Pegasus) of this set will definitely make you go out to get Season 2.5. My recommendation: Get 2.5 right away and watch Pegasus on 2.5 because it has more information than the Pegasus episode on 2.0."
4,How greedy can a studio get?,"Love the show, hate the marketing. This is another example of balatant studio greed. Releasing HALF a season on DVD at the same cost as a full season would run. And they wonder why people pirate downloads!"
5,"Good, but special features lacking...","I just wanted to point out that the reviewer who claimed this set contains the 90 minute version of Pegasus was incorrect, there are infact no special features related to Pegasus on this set. Overall very dissapointing since I really wanted to see the longer version of Pegasus."
3,Not in the fine print.,"I agree that not enough information is given regarding Season 2.I saw it recently in a store and realized when I picked up the box that there were only 3 DVD's in the box so it couldn't be the full season 2. If I had ordered it on line as I nearly did, I would not have known that. More info is in order.The series itself however is fantastic."
4,Why Is It So Much for 10 Episodes?!?!?!?,Can someone please explain why the 2.0 and 2.5 sets are going for near Forty Bucks each? This is crazy to have to spend this much! To watch the entire season you have to buy both sets and spend near ninty bucks currently! That being said this is awesome show! I jsut hope the price goes down in the near future.
4,This is TERRIBLE!!,"I am absolutely NOT a sci-fi fan. However, this is my favorite show and I can't wait until January!! The show is EXCELLENT, however the fact that they are releasing HALF a season like this is TERRIBLE!!"
3,Season 2 can not be downloaded in widescreen!,Make sure that you aware that Amazon does not offer season 2 for download in widescreen! I don't know what they are thinking. Season 1 an 3 are both offered in widescreen.
4,Sir Im receiving Colonial Transponder 4 3 1 0 onethird,"Battlestar Galactica is held together by the talent of Edward James Olmos in the role of Commander Adama. What would happen if a Battlestar Skipper showed up on Earth, how could you tell he was not of this Earth? My Daughter sings We were born on the Battlestar Nimitz and the Food was really Good to the 1978 Galactica main theme music. I am looking forward to the Battlestar Galactica and the rest of the fleet finding Planet Earth. To paraphrase the 1978 Galactica ending, Fleeing the Cylon tyranny the last battlestars Moon 167 and Moon 168 are a rag tag fugitive fleet on a lonely quest a shining Planet the homeworld of us all known as Coaltrain"
2,Only half the season?,"What a rip-off. Only half the season? I purchased this expecting to see the entire year.I also purchased season 1, a nice hefty collection of five disks.. What I thought was season 2 was ""light"" at three disks.Universal Studios, what a bunch of scammers."
1,"Best show, worst deal","This is easily the best show out there. Possibly the best, ever.However, releasing half of a season and selling it for the price of a full season of other shows is horrible, and shows an amazing amount of disrespect for the consumer. They're not ""getting it out there"" they're trying to rip you off.Wait for the season to finish, and then buy the whole thing. Don't fall for this."
1,rip off,"Its not even a ""box set"" its a few episodes. Why they try pass this off as such is beyond me.just release the whole season !!!"
1,"Doesn't Deserve the name ""BATTLESTAR GALACTICA""","The HIGHLY OVERRATED Sci-Fi Channel show. Think ""Beverly Hills 90210"" rather than Battlestar. SOOO different from the original, the name should have NEVER carried over. It's not a 're-imagining', but a totally different story with elements of other Science Fictions shows thrown in. I mean, if you ""re-imagined"" the sinking of the Titanic, would you actually call the ship the ""Edmund Fitzgerald"" which sank on it's last voyage in 1613 B.C. crossing the Mississippi River due to hitting a discarded scoop of ice cream? NO! It WOULDN'T be about the TITANIC anymore.The show MAY have been fine in it's own right, but the producers gave a lot of lip service to understanding the ""valuable property"" they had, and they would do things ""right.""It was an attempt to cash in on the name while throwing away 98% of the original, and keeping only the names and a couple of other concepts.If you like the original, stay away from here!"
4,very enjoyable and gripping,"It took me until the 2nd season of the new Battlestar to really get hooked. The original show was all about the relationships above ship and the hope that kept everyone going. This series is much more stark, perhaps more realistic, and more convoluted. There are many unanswered questions, of course, like, when Starbuck jumped home, and they stole the ship and came back, why didn't Starbuck bring her new boyfriend back with her? Just a lot of glitches like that. But, lately, they're doing much better with the warmer relationships, particularly between Starbuck and Apollo. Overall, though, a good watch."
5,Battlestar Galactica - Season 2.0 .....,SicFi dies a mind blowing job with the redo on Battlestar Galactica series. The story writing will have you on the on your toes waiting for the next show to see what happens. I would get into this show if your a SciFi fan or a fan of the old show.
3,Warning - 10 Episodes Only,"I love the series, but why is this collection for Season 2 only 10 episodes long? In Canada or the U.S. Season 2 is longer than this. Otherwise an awesome collection..."
1,"Excellent series, terrible boxed set.","Enough has been written about BSG to commend it to any discerning viewer. My review, therefore, is not of the series itself, but of this awful boxed set. In an act of sheer profiteering Universal decided to break Season 2 into twain, offering half the season in one set and other in second. The upshot for consumers is that we have to pay close to $80 to acquire the full season 2 - far above the average price for a single season set, even for imported series like Doctor Who and Torchwood. I would advise any fan of the show to borrow this season from a friend or rent it, until Universal comes to sanity and issues a reasonably priced single boxed set."
3,Feeling a bit ripped off...,While I will still(of course) buy the second half of season 2 when it is released I do feel taken advantage of by having to pay full box-set price twice for one season. This is not a good way to treat the fans and supporters of any show.
1,"Absolutely Terrific show, horrorible DVD set.","This set is a rip-off. There are virtually no special features, and it is only half of a season, 10 episodes! Wait until there is a good complete season 2 set of this amazing show!"
4,Eagerly anticipating the second half of the season,"This set continues the high quality scripts of the first season. One of the things I like best about BSG is the suprising and occasionally shocking twists in the storylines (like the cylon getting blown out of the airlock in the first season). Still cannot figure out why politicians wear suits on spacecraft. Mostly very enjoyable ""the final cut""is excellent and the opening scenes of ""pegasus"" left me with a lump in my throat, but I am something of a sucker for these things..."
5,Satisfied,Amazon.com delivered the season episode box on time and in great shape. Nothing else needs to be said...JMS
5,the new battlestar galactica,"this series is just magnificant. it's action, drama and si-fi all in one.what it isn't is funny. the new crew find bad luck one turn after the next fighting the cylons but hey bad turns are real life."
2,"WTF, this is only half of season 2!!!",This bugged me alot. I was expecting Season 2. Not part of Season 2. I think this is [junk]. Where is the rest of the DVDs!!!!The sorry's were great! but damn it you cut me off halfway through the season and I'm pissed.
5,Battlestar Rocks!,"Excellent show. The best since Deep Space Nine in my opinion. As good (if not better) than 24. I wish they had put extra behind the scenes documentaries on the dvd, but the quality of the episodes compensates for this"
5,smashing,bringing back childhood memories with a touch of modern techniques and entrigue and thrill.
5,The Best Sci-Fi Show since X-Files,"This new version of Battlestar Galactica features some of the best writing on television today. The acting is also top-notch, specifically from veterans Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonnell. This set contains the first ten episodes of Season 2 (the other half of the season gets released on DVD in September '06). It starts off by digging deep into the religion and politics of the Battlestar Galactica universe, and ends with a spectacular cliffhanger featuring Michelle Forbes in a fascinating and disturbing guest star role.It is not just for sci-fi fans. My wife wasn't into sci-fi before we discovered this show, but she is as big a fan as I am of this new spin on a classic."
3,Are you kidding me with the half season?,"For all you people that are saying it should be obvious by the 2.0 that there would be a 2.1, this makes no sense. Should I also expect then a 2.2, 2.3 etc?? This is a ripoff no matter how you look at it and a cheap scam. Outstanding show though. I'm dissapointed by the cost of owning an entire season 2. I have season 1 and was looking forward to adding season 2 to my collection. I don't think I'll buy it now though."
1,Rip Off,"This is only half the season of the show for the price of a full season!It's a great series, based on the CONTENT I'd give it a five, but te fact that it's half a season for this much is ridiculous. I'll wait for the full season to be released for the same price."
3,"Lousy marketing ploy, great content","I love this show, the content is superb and in my opinion, if this was the full second season release it would warrant 5 stars.However, to release half of the season at this high cost is unnaceptable. One reason I may think this is done is to bait friends and family of harcore fans (such as myself) who are uninformed and are lokking for a Christmas present. I think this is deplorable. Just release at a fair price when all is said and done."
1,Great show but this DVD is a rip-off,"If you think that this is season two of the fantastic Battlestar Galactica, you are dead wrong.**THIS IS ONLY A PARTIAL RELEASE OF SEASON TWO**.There are absolutely no indications that this set contains ANY material that won't be on the full season two set (that I am assuming they will release... after they swindle everyone out of their money for this partial set).Usually when a partial set is released, a second partial set is released and then a full set is released (usually at less than 70% of the cost of the two partial sets combined).Please let the studios know that you will not stand for this type of scam by not buying this set. You can wait.. use the force or something if you have to."
4,So much better than the original,"Watching the original series as a child in the 70's I knew it was insipid dreck. As did the rest of the country, hence it's rapid cancellation. The writing was so bad as to be insulting, even to a child. Which is why I have been so pleasantly surprised by this updated version.They've taken the same premise and actually put intelligence and talent behind it. This is a VAST IMPROVEMENT over the original. An affecting, and smart human drama that happens to be couched in science fiction. While not every episode is perfect, even the least are head and shoulders above most of what passes for drama on television. So.............DO NOT LET A (reasonable) AVERSION TO THE 70'S SERIES cause you to miss what is one of the best written shows on television."
4,Not quite what it should have been,"This is a great show but this review is about this lame rushed out the door boxset. In case you have read info on this disc set elsewhere saying otherwise: there is NO longer version of the final episode ""Pegasus"", there are NO Podcasts for the final 2 episodes and one other (so 7 podcasts for 10 episodes). Not much in the way of extras either as per Season 1 though over an hour of deleted scenes, though again NONE from the final episode. Sooo, yes this was very much rushed out of the door in time for the holidays in what one might consider an incomplete form. The big question now is: will we be forced to repurchase all of these episodes to get the remainder of the season or will we be able to just buy the second half? And I think it's mean spirited to have a coupon for $10 off the Serentiy DVD or $5 off the Seaquest DVD but NO coupon for the rest of Season 2. They are SO taking monetary advantage of their core fanbase. Supergreat show, lame-o boxset."
3,Galactica II,"Imaginative, thoughtful. It's only worth watching once. I haven't seen seasons 3 or 4. This season still makes it look like man isn't going to survive"
1,"Don't Be Duped Again, Folks","It's stupid enough that this series takes a 3 month hiatus right in the middle of it's second season. But, to then release the mere 10 episodes on DVD to promote the second half of the season is BEYOND stupidity. Are they spending so much money on this show that they have to con the fans into forking over money top pay for the second season themselves?This isn't the first time they'd done this either. When season 1 came out, it was released as a ""UK version"" and sold exclusively to Best Buy. Fans forked over their $50 for this, but 2 months later the American version was released for a LESS than $50.So now they expect fans to buy this half season, then 9 months later, buy the entire season as a whole?I'd think even fans of this show should would be outraged by the greedy studio's cleaver little ploys at having fans pay twice.Don't be duped, folks. Wait a few more months and get the WHOLE season, with ALL of the bells and whistles."
4,Season 2.0,"The industry is releasing half a set now and half a set later because they know people will buy them.How do you get a complete set for less money? You have to be patient any say to the industry ""I love the program, but you can go to hell if you think I'm dumb enough tp fall for your ploy"". And that is all it is. A ploy to make more money. Its simple. Keep your money, show the industry they are taking advantage, turn your back on the industry and the industry will be the ones groveling at your feet.I've had it with all who want to take advantage and rip off the customer while they the industry sit back and smile as the green flows their way."
4,"Well, just barely 4 stars..","Ok, I just finished this book, like 10 mins ago, and these are a few thoughts. The beginning of the book is great. I loved it, their journey through the Great Tree Sagia was great. And, then, they emerged from the tree. At that point, I found that the story fell abit. While the plot is good, I found it hardly enthralling. Matter of fact, as I got closer to the end of the book, I just wanted it to end. Now, the characters are rather cool. Achmed and Grunthor are great, and while Rhapsody is fine, I am tired of every man gawking at her. Yeah yeah, supposely she is the most beautiful creature to walk the earth, but, who cares, and is their a point to her looks? I found that somewhat annoying. All in all, if your looking for a simple read, this is it. It doesnt compare to the likes of Tad Williams, or George R. R. Martin."
1,Why?,"From the blurb on the back of this book, i thought, ahh, this sounds promising. But unfortunately, half way through i thought, why bother? The only good thing about this book was that Haydon has managed to create her characters well enough that they managed to annoy the hell out of me. I just couldn't stand them, especially Rhapsody, she has to be the most irratating character i have ever meet. (And i've read some pretty appaling fantasy books)But that wasn't the only problem, the story was predictable and not particularly original, and although i read the trilogy, by the end of the first book, you knew what was going to happen. Although i quite liked her writing style, i found the application of it on this particualar plot line characters very poor.I would not recommend you buy this particular book, it makes you cringe, it lacks depth and charaisma, with the maion character being the most pathetic and throughly stupid heroine i have ever read about."
1,Shallow Characters. Could Not Get Past First Chapter,"For some reason, Amazon links the author Robin Hobb (of ""Assassin's Apprentice"") with Elizabeth Haydon. Intrigued, I decided to check out ""Rhapsody : Child of Blood"".Unfortunately, after the first chapter of the book, I was groaning in disgust. There is no depth of character, nor do there seem to be any plausible situations. In the first few pages, the main character is transported in time. Somehow, he just accepts this. It is as if the author does not care to go into detail.The hero then meets a breathtakingly beautiful, innocent and perfect girl. He realizes that this is his soulmate. They immediately fall in love. They have sex. (They are 14.) They become separated. End chapter one. It's that simple.I presume that the rest of the story details their struggles to find each other again. However, I could not stomach any more of this cheesy drivel."
4,Wonderful!,"I picked this book up by chance off a sale rack, and I loved it! It is fresh, and exciting. It seems to be a new spin on old themes. Refreshing, and fast. I eagerly await the rest of the series."
1,A mix between fantasy and the pappiest of romance books,"I bought this based on the strength of customer reviews, but could not get past 10 pages. It's really that bad. I got as far as reading about a young hero magically transported somewhere else where he meets and falls in love with a woman, all within a few hours. There's language like ""the way she looked at him started a sensation in his groin.."" I am not kidding! Terrible. Avoid at all costs if you are a fan of martin, Jordan, Tolkien, etc.They should put this on supermarket chekout lines."
1,Two dimensional,"Despite the fact that our heroine and her accomplices spend a large amount of time underground, the story is entirely two-dimensional. It certainly held my attention, though; I couldn't help wondering what silly episode the young Rhapsody would find herself in next. Isn't this supposed to be Fantasy, not something from a latter-day Cabinets des Fees with teenage dialog?"
1,"Good PLot, Horribal Writing style","I do not know if it is because I read fantasy as a young man and didn't know good writing from a good plot or what, but This woman has alot of maturing to do with her writing style, I found it to be rather childish, though the concept I thought was good, I however will not buy the sequel and regrett buying the hardcover... If your going to buy this then please check it out from the library, save your money for a better book."
1,Yawn,"I've tried reading this at least three times, and have never gotten more than three or four chapters with out getting bored or falling asleep."
2,"Good story concept, but pornographic","I bought this book because I have read several others that I loved by this author, and because of the high ratings. However, after receiving the book I flipped through it only to find that it is sexually explicit and pornographic. Needless to say, I am trashing this one.*Even if it was just characters having an affair it wouldn't be so bad, but this is smutty romance paperback level of sex. Which, some people may like, but I'm just not into that kind of book."
2,No Big Deal,"No better, no worse than any other fantasy novel. This means generally poorly conceived and much of the characterization and actions are re-tellings of decades-old tales.Main character is a joke. Starts as an prostitute who has somehow become an amazing singing mage, but then later she becomes so beautiful that people are stunned by her. Also, at this time she starts acting wide-eyed and ignorant for some reason.Her side-kicks are equally stupid and un-explained. Divine powers in combat, such as slaying enemies from miles away with odd projectile weapons or gracefully wiping out everyone in hand-to-hand combat without breaking a sweat.So if you read and enjoy most modern fantasy novels this equally trashy book might be for you."
3,I'm conflicted ...,"This book is great! The whole trilogy is great! I love the rising female fantasy writers because of the emotion they build into their stories. But what I don't understand (and maybe this is bacause I am a male) is why some of the up and coming female fantasy authors seem to be hanging on to sexually explicit scenes (or at least scenes with overly explicit descriptions and conversation) such as what one would find in a pulp fiction lust novel. Juliet Marillier is another such author who wrote a wonderful trilogy, a wonderful heart-ripping love story, but cheapened it with such imagery. Isn't it possible to have lots of emotion, reveal the evil side of humanity, and still keep it rated PG?"
5,Good Read,"If you a looking for a good story, I recommend it. If you are looking for high literature, like some of the reviews seem to be looking for, then read War and Peace.This story is interestingly different from the beginning. Yes it stretches the imagination in places, but it's FANTASY, duh! My acid test is: Do I identify with the characters, and this has a big YES for as an answer."
2,Well written but a horrid plot,"Hayden has the capability to be a great writer, but I will never understand the plot device of spending half a freaking book inside a tree. I kept waiting for something to happen. Worth a try in paperback because it is original."
4,Rapsody: Child of Blood... Enjoyable,"I found myself wanting to know more and more as I read. The series is purely entertaining and magical. Character development is superb. For fantasy lovers, I highly recommend this series."
5,"Rhapsody, Prophecy, Destiny...","This enchantingly written, epic fantasy novel is the best book that I've ever read. It is movingly written, with a complex plot, and compelling characters. It brought out strong feelings, and by the end of the book, I had laughed out loud, cried, and decided to make everyone I know read it. I had my mom buy the trilogy, (Rhaps, Proph, Dest), and I've read it over and over again. The whole time I'm reading it, I can't put it down. I have never read a book that even starts to compare with this book, and I don't expect that I ever will. If you're into any kind of fantasy, historical fiction, adventure-and even if you're not, READ IT!! It is the best book ever!"
4,Captivating,"I absolutely loved this book. I've read it many many times and will continue to do so.The Prologue got me hooked on the story of Rhapsody and I had to follow her out of that. Seeing how she grew up from there on was worth it. The only reason I give 4 stars is because Hadyon can dwell on details a little too much. When you get to about 1/4 through the book it seems like that one part goes on till you are probably 1/2 way through the book. It gets boring after awhile. Later in the book when she starts involving the real plot of the series it picks up speed. Trust me, if you can get through that one part, you'll know what I'm talking about, it's totally worth reading the rest. There is suspense, intrigue, war, hate, love, and over all just that mystical magic involved with fantasy. Try it...you'll like it!"
4,A fun book!,"Rhapsody is a fun book to read, set with subtle humor that is just wonderful. Rhapsody is a wonderfully strong, stubborn woman who winds up finding herself in the ""company"" of two very different, but eventually very likeable, shady characters. Their story kept me glued to the book until the very end, and now I can't wait to go and get the 2nd in this series."
2,Dissapointment,"Child of Blood starts up quite well. I found the Prologue and the first chapter very interesting. The rest of the book though drags on and on, narrating the endless travel of the protagonists through the root and drowning the important bits in sea of irrelevant descriptions. Rhapsody, the title character, becomes very inconsistent. While her change from an innocent young girl into the scarred, tough and resilient prostitute/Singer/Namer is realistic and believable, her later backslide into a sweet and fairly helpless, blushing perfection is rather hard to swallow. Her companions are a bit better, especially Grunthnor, but I lost interest in them fairly quickly. Dissapointing."
5,Great fantasy!,"I really loved this book. I bought it to get some variety in my reading. I seem to read the same handful of authors over and over. This was a great purchase! Elizabeth Haydon will definately be added to my list of favorite authors. From the moment I started reading, I couldn't put it down. She also managed some twists I wasn't expecting. As soon as I finished this one, I picked up the sequel, and it is just as good. I definately recomend it to anyone who is a fan of fantasy or romance novels. This is definately a fantasy novel, but she throws in just enough romance for the truely girly side of me. A reall great read!"
1,fantasy for romance readers,"This book is a sort of experiment when several characters and concepts which belong more to the realm of romance novels are introduced into fantasy-like world. Among the things thus transferred there are too many stereotypes for my liking and not even a shade of humor to make them beleivable. The strongest example is Rhapsody herself, who is too full of sachharine to inspire any kind of compassion. While there are several creative ideas in the world design (I liked the tree concept), the totally volumeless characters kill the awe quite effectively. Also the ""film-editing"" approach felt artificial to no end. The bottom line is - if you hate romance novels, you'll hate this too."
2,Definite Love-Hate Relationship,"This one really was a difficult one to decide on. On the one hand, the many details in the plot are creative and do get your attention and interest. On the other hand, a lot of them go nowhere. Over and over again I'd find myself waiting for some explanation of some intriguing beginning -- only to find myself going down some other path altogether.I guess if you don't care much about continuity it's a fun ride, but I found it just too frustrating. Still, by the end of the book I was kind of wishing for more."
5,It's going into my Library of all around good read,This is the sort of book I have been waiting for a long time. To Elizabeth Haydon you have written a brillant book that for once knows how to write comedy and actually make the reader laught out loud.The characters are beautifully made with both the good and the bad sides equally balanced showing the emotions as they are usually felt. The fact she wrote both sexes and didn't make either of them look like imbociles is great.
5,There are not enough stars in the sky,"...to adequately rate this book. There is magic, mystery and adventure on every page. The characters have to be some of the all-time greatest in fantasy literature.Unable to arrange to wrap up a fallen star for your loved one as a present for the upcoming holidays? Buy them this book--it's the closest you will ever come."
1,A waste of my weekend,"I started off really liking this book because I thought it had interesting ideas. However, the book soon turned into a huge historical lecture with too many similar sounding names and events that I started to get confused and to not care. The worst of it for me is Rhapsody. I found the fact that Rhapsody became a perfect woman who lost her previous ""soiled"" state and who transformed into a beauty that causes all men to become blithering idiots totally degrading to women. By making Rhapsody unaware of her beauty and the power her beauty has over men, the author appeared to try to cover up how ridiculous all of this is. I'm just very tired of reading books that portrays all heroines to be skinny and beautiful. What is wrong with an imperfect woman, both in the physical and mental sense, that saves the day? I felt disappointed and angry that I wasted a good part of my weekend reading this horrible book."
1,This is why fantasy shelves aren't worth perusing for adults,Characters straight out of Saturday morning cartoons.Stories that make no sense.Written for the junior high school set.
1,Not worth the paper it is written on,"Wher can I start? This is a story that could have been great. The plot and the book, if written by an experienced writter, could have made you awestruck. However, Haydon makes you wonder if the publishers even read the book before it was printed.So many loose ends, so many plots within plots, made my head spin. If you are one of the few lucky patient ones, you will get a little bit of surprise at the end of this first volume. But it is a surprise that is just not probable. I am not going to spoil the book for those who still want to read it so I should stop right here. A word of warning, I know that there are not many good fantasies being published lately, but you can wait a bit longer and spend your money on better things for now."
1,Do not read this book,"I get the feeling that the people who gave this book five stars are of the female sex. I had never read a fantasy author that was a women before and thought I would give it a try. To my disbelief, I found myself reading about a girl power charle's angel wanta be, who adopted every child that she looked upon. This showed me that a women does not know how to write for the male mind and therefore I resorted to picking up my father's old Robert E. Howard's Conan books. There is just something about decapitating a band of warriors, then throwing a naked girl over your shoulder, then retreating to your sleeping mat for the night that dispells any of the girl power, romance crap Haydon wrote about. So in conclusion THANK YOU to all who gave this book five stars, thanks to you I wasted $8.49."
1,Wow! Stinks Bad!,"After reading the reviews here, I thought it would be the greatest fantasy novel ever, and that I wouldn't put it down. Boy was I wrong! it was quit easy to put it down...in fact I nodded off and it fell down. Astonishingly poor character and story development. Previous critical reviewers covered the flaws well, read them I won't repeat them here."
5,EXCELLENT!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and look forward to reading the sequels. Some of the things which bothered other reviewers were things I liked about the book. So Rhapsody was a bit too perfect--this is a fantasy, after all. In my fantasies, men's jaws would drop open when they looked at me, too."
5,Delightful,"This entire series by Elizabeth Haydon has been an absolute delight to lose myself in. The web of relationships, development of the characters and gradually revealed picture of a world in another time and place made it unpleasant to return to reality. Without being able to critically comment on the finer points of literature, I limit my assessment of books to the extent I become fascinated with the alternative reality - and the minute I finished reading Rhapsody I was out of the house to find Prophecy. The tantalising clues left throughout the book to deeper, hidden meanings and themes keep you guessing and as I am still awaiting the arrival of the final book in the series, I nearly cried in frustration when I finished the second book within two days of it's purchase (that's not reading full-time!)"
4,Pretty Good...,"Rhapsody is one of those books that once you pick it up it's Difficult to put down. Thestory follows a girl called Rhapsody on a mad journey with two warriors. Rhapsody has the power to use music to create magic...This book is notperfect, in fact in parts it gets slightly repetitive in its descriptions, but if you like pure fantasy this will be a great read for you...Its perfect for a rainy day...There's prophecies to intrigue and the story really keeps you hanging on. The descriptive languagepulls you in and makes you feel part of this amazing girls life.If you love stories that exercise your imagination and you see yourself as a heroine fighting evilthen book is definitely for you.Buy this if you get a chance..."
5,engaging read,I read the hard copy of this trilogy years ago and am re-reading on my kindle. The details are refreshingly consistent throughout the books and the characters are endearing. I will re-read the entire series.
3,If you can make it to chapter 32...,"I would not recommend this book. It was un-necessarily long. The book became boring until the 32nd Chapter. After that, it was pretty good. There were some good parts throughout the book, but they were so scattered about that the book became boring. My biggest problem was that the story did not move along as it should have; a lot of the scense were stretched and some were excessive. I don't think I'll be reading the sequel anytime soon."
1,I was amazed by the poor quality of this novel,"The summary sounded good. The cover was generic, but not terrible. It had good cover quotes. So I picked up Rhapsody. I even fought my way through the sequels. I hated them. Rhapsody was quite possibly the most obnoxious character I have ever encountered. She's flat, far too perfect to be even slightly believable. She is, to use an internet term, a Mary Sue, a perfect and annoying female protagonist. Look up the original fiction Mary Sue test on google. You'll see what I mean. Even without being able to answer the questions about author intent, Rhapsody tests off the charts.I liked exactly one line of Achmed's at the end of Destiny. That was the sum total of the enjoyment I gained in over a thousand pages of reading. I'm aware that this is a diatribe. I rarely dislike books. I simply happen to hate flat characters. And Rhapsody wasn't just flat, she was linear."
3,Loses momentum after the first half of the book,"""Rhapsody"" starts out very strongly and keeps a good pace for the first half of the book. The characters are very likeable, and the writing and plot elements are excellent. Throughout the first half of the book, the story keeps a good pace and kept me turning the page. Unfortunately... the momentum of the book had just about completely stopped when I got about half way through. I found the last half of the book rather uninteresting; it was a real chore for to get to the last page. When I finally did finish ""Rhapsody"", I was left with a vaguely disappointed feeling. I can't quite put my finger on it, but I guess I just found the end of the book rather generic. Because the book started so strongly and the writing style was well developed, I may give another of this author's books a chance."
4,A good writer in the wrong genre,"Elizabeth Haydon is a good writer. However, her style belongs more in the ranks of New York Literary Fiction than in Fantasy. Her descriptive style can sometimes get in the way of the story, making it a difficult read.Hardcore fantasy enthusiasts will find nothing new here, but it's a pleasant ride. Wait for the paperback, but definitely pick up a copy."
2,Decent series start--but sloooooow moving,"Acceptable first effort by the author with potentially interesting characters; however, they are a bit too cartoonlike and one-dimensional to be believed (the good guys are completely good, the bad guys are thoroughly awful). Well plotted story line, but it takes far too many repetitious sequences to get the action advanced."
2,There are worse books...,"But this one is not worth reading, in my opinion. I'm with the other reviewers who found this book aimless and dull. Characters litter the scenes and you're left wondering ""why?"", ""who?"", ""what are they doing?"".Dialogue and inter-character interactions are hopelessly contrived and stilted. Characters' emotions are handled clumsily and baldly, tears rolling down cheeks, winking, grins, lots of shuddering, etc.Since it's apparently OK to comment on other reviewers on this forum, I'm no fool with ""reading comprehension"" problems, this book is just old-fashioned junk reading. Regarding the flood of 5-star reviews, it's not hard to get 4-5 star ratings in the fantasy area, shoot, apparently every fantasy novel was the greatest book ever according to numerous reviewers. I'm warning you to avoid this one."
1,Kindle version not worth the money,"Don't bother buying the kindle version of this book, I don't think an editor even glanced at it and the typos, errors, mistypes, punctuation, and other mistakes made some sections simply unreadable. Due to the very poor job done on the first book, I'm taking a pass on the others."
4,Don't miss this one,"This book is first in a trilogy based loosly on Celtic mythology. It starts out perhaps more as a romance novel than fantasy, but don't be deceived. This is all necessary to the plot, though it doesn't become apparent until the end. The story follows Rhapsody, Achmed, and Grunthor as they travel through the World Tree, and 1000 years into the future, as they run from their personal demons. Will it be enough to escape the F'dor bent on the destruction of the world?"
5,"Intelligent, subtle and darkly humorous","What a great book! It breaks so many of the awful Terry Brooks-type Tolkien wannabe fantasy molds, and takes risks. There is great action done in the manner of Alfred Hitchcock and Tolkien himself, who did not show tons of endless action and graphic violence, unlike today's ""masters."" It has great character depth and shows many sides of each person, which is new as well. I am in awe of the deft way in which the author, like Meridion in the prologue, spins and then weaves together so many subplots and storylines in a wonderful opening to what is sure to be a fabulous series."
5,Great Suprise!,"I am very leary to try out new authors. There are a few that I am ""loyal"" to Robert Jordan, Steven Brust, to name a few. Of course, since they write a book once every few years I need to try out new ones. Many that I have tried have been bad or boring. However, this book is one of the best that I have read in a fantasy in a while. As the other reviews attest, I has it all: action, mystery, romance, etc. It has a strong story and a well thought out history and culture to the world. It ends with you having great anticipation for the sequal. Hopefully, it will be out soon!"
5,Five isn't enough stars,"Some books are great reads, others keep you up all night to finish them, and some transform your life. RHAPSODY did all three for me. There are so many things in this book that I have never seen in a fantasy before, and so much that reminds me of old time story tellers and legend lore. It made me feel so many emotions, not the least of which was a haunting sadness similar to the one felt at the end of the Lord of the Rings, when the war is over but the world is changed forever nonetheless. It is an amazing talent to be able to make readers feel this much."
5,Wonderful New Novel,I love this novel and am waiting for the sequels anxiously. I think the characters were great and I enjoyed the comic relief.
3,"After reading the reviews, I expected a better book ...","Elizabeth Haydon's first novel demonstrates real potential as a fantasy writer, but this book disappoints in several ways. It is just too typical--female singer of magical power becomes a warrior, and she just happens to be compellingly beautiful too. The plot bogs down in the middle and never really recovers. A main character is restored from inevitable death by magic (deus ex machina). A silly companion (Jo) is added to the group who adds nothing to the group's chemistry nor to the plot. Etc., etc. Yes, I was disappointed. Don't believe the Tolkien hype. This book is not even in the class of Guy Kay or George Martin. But Haydon has potential and I look forward to her next book."
1,Another Ugly Review,"This is my first review here on Amazon and I'm here because I feel compelled to prevent others from wasting their time with this flabby, long-winded stack of paper. This book is all over the place, it goes from shabby romance, to stale sword-n-sorcery passages through just plain baffling passages such as the endless tromping through the underworld for who knows what reason. And you wouldn't believe the stuff that passes for dialogue. Ridiculous. Go elsewhere for your reading pleasure. Or you can have my copy, it's clogging the toilet at the St Louis airport."
4,Excellent Beginning To A Trilogy,"Whoever wants to pick up a trilogy and start reading this is nice place to start. First book of the Symphony of ages is a excellent beginning for people who just stepped into reading trilogy's of fantasy. The way this writer writes is she is very sensual in her words. She makes you feel the story but not be too involved. You can get a good kick out of some of her jokes she puts into the story also. One small part I would share is this book is a fantasy from a womens point of view at times. It does even have some sexual parts that turn out to be very funny from a point of view. If you want to start a fantasy trilogy with some sensual side, adventure, a little humour and be part of the story this is a excellent book. If you are just looking for blood, guts, gore and fighting all the time then this may not be your type of book. I like this book and am starting the next book prophecy."
4,Kudos to Rhapsody!,"What a great book. Thank you Ms Haydon for giving me an incredible weekend lost in Rhapsody's world. I can't believe this is a first novel,and I can't wait to read the next installment. The 3 main characters(Rhapsody,Achmed & Grunthor) are really alive and fleshed out,the action is well written and each chapter leaves you wanting more. My only complaint was that the middle of the book dragged just a bit,it felt as though pages were written just to increase the length to the story,otherwise I would whole-heartedly recommend this book to anyone,even those not into the ""fantasy"" genre. Looking forward to book 2 in the series with great anticipation!"
1,An blindingly bad book.,"While derivative post-Tolkien fantasy continues to predominate in the marketplace, it is heartening to see someone who has done away with Tolkien altogether and derives only from Ray Feist, Anne McCaffrey, R. A. Salvatore, and Robert Jordan. Unintentionally funny in its badness, the only fantasy work I have read that made me laugh this much was The Eye of Argon. I was utterly finished by the ""proud, insolent thrusting"" of the Bad Guy's one-eyed obelisk (who *did* he get for design-build??), and the author's willingess to wallow in multigenre cliches means that this will set a new standard for swill.Apparently it is not possible to award zero or negative stars here, but this book merits a thumping minus-ten. With this book, Tor insults the intelligence of its readers, and raises questions about the role of the publisher in shaping the field and public perception of it."
1,I couldn't even read the book it was so bad,"I attempted to read this book due to the fact that it seemed from the cover that it might be interesting. Unfortunately, it wasn't. In fact it was so boring, so poorly written it failed to capture me past the first few chapters. Usually I give an author some time to build it up, but the writing in this story was so poorly thought out that I gave up in disgust and went to read something better. I've seen reviews for her books after this, touting how wonderful she is now and how great her talent is built up and frankly, I find it almost hard to believe. This book isn't worth full price. If you must try it out, go to the public library to see if you'd be interested in it first."
4,A great beginning,"I was pleasantly surprised by Haydon's book. It's a great beginning to what should be a tremendous career. Intriguing and original characters drive the story, which also seems to be a minor flaw - the plotting is a little choppy at times. You'll notice it, but it won't get in the way of enjoying the story. Im looking forward to the next book!"
1,This phone is terrible,"If you want to spend all day trying to figure out the manual, you have come to the right system. I'm still having a hard time looking for a 4 line phone that's easy to install and easy to use. The panasonic that we had died on us 9 months into it. And that one was fine."
1,Run for your life!,Everything its detractors say is true. I've had many phones in 37 years running a small business and this is by far the very worst one. The first unit I got completely quit working after just a few weeks. They sent me another one and didn't even want the defective one back! The second unit was no better than the first - it won't hang up when a caller doesn't leave a message and the resulting very loud beeping tone drives everyone insane. The phone doesn't distinguish between messages on different lines. The sound quality is so muddy that people are constantly asking me to repeat myself. Setup is unnecessarily difficult. And the most ordinary everyday functions are needlessly hard to perform. I'm investing in a whole new system and the AT&T 984 is going back to the store for a refund. No more AT&T products for me!
3,"AT&T 984 - Good phone, bad answering device","Answering devices ansewers all lines. No selection. It's either on all lines of off all lines. I only want it to answer line 1 but even with the ringers off on the other lines it still answers them. Recorded sound quality is also noticably ""watery"" sounding, not very clear. My Panasonic KX-TG5100 is much clearer.I bought this for my home office and would sure not buy this model again. Phone is fine, good feel, menus a bit cumbersome."
3,Good phone - hard to set up,"Just recently purchased. It took me a very long time to set up this phone - the manual was very confusing. Once set up however, it is easy to use and I have virtually no problems using it."
4,"Good phone, bad manual","Getting this phone up and running is pretty straightforward, despite the fact that the manual is short on detail. This is particularly the case where it addresses the Auto Attendant feature, so if you're buying the phone for the Auto Attendant, you might have to fight with it a bit to get it going. Otherwise, it's a great phone, sounds good, no problem transferring/paging/conference/etc."
1,I wished I had my old system back......,"My phone freezes, as if your computer screen would freeze. You can't do anything until you unplug the power cord, and remove the 9V battery. Once you replace the battery, and plug the power back in, you are fine, for around 48 hours. Why can't I find I a phone?"
5,Snow roof rake,"This rake is just right for snow. Light and very well made. Sometimes its hard to find a good rugged snow rake, but this one surely fits my needs very well. I would recomnend it to anyone. You can even buy an extention for it if you wish."
1,You'll Never Get It,"When I ordered this item, it was ""in stock"" and delivery was expected in ""3 to 5 days"". 4 weeks later it still hasn't shipped. The snow will melt off my roof before I get to use this item. Order something else from a company that will ship it to you."
1,Disappointing,The vendor sent the wrong size and then could not provide the correct size props to Amazon altho it was a bit of a hassle I rec'd a complete refund
3,gift socks,"I bought this as a gift. Upon examining the socks before mailing to the relative I bought them for for they seemed to be well made and would definitely keep the feet warm. I was not sure of the size, so I hoping the hear from my relative for the other aspects of this item in order to give it a full review."
5,Time Is Slipping Away,"Jake is an inspiration to all who have read his poetry books. I have been inspired twice because I have met this young man. He is a gifted writer and is like a storyteller using poetry. Jake reminds us that despite our shortcomings, we are capable of achieving our dreams. His poetry reflects life experiences we all share. Every parent needs to share this young man's story with their children because they need positve influences to help shape their lives for tomorrow."
1,It's a portable rip off,"I thought of buying this thing then i looked at the reviews, this thing is horrrrrrriblllllllllle! No car adaptor? No contact in the manual? 16 hours to recharge? Heavy battery so hard to control and the thing really only works for a month or two? I didn't even have to buy this thing to know that it's horrible. If you're reading this and have a big road trip for more than about 3 hrs, you should send this portable rip of back.I blame Toysrus for selling this faulty piece of merchandise, wait, why call it merchandise, i should call it JUNK!I'M GOING SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!!!"
1,this is a a gay thing!!!!!!!!,when i was 8 this thing came out i thought it was cool but now it seem gay why cant you just buy the sliver ones not the kid one thing i hate.
5,AWESOME,I do not understand how someone had a problem with this. Mine works perfect and has since i got it. I sooooo recomend this it is awsome!!!
2,CHEAP!!!!!!!!!,"I'VE PURCHASED THIS PORTABLE COLOR TEEN TEC DVD PLAYER FOR MY 9YR OLD DAUG. I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT. WELL IT'S NOT WORKING NOW. I BROUGHT IT AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT. I'VE BEEN CALLING THE NUMBER TO THE COMPANY, BUT NO ONE ANSWER'S THE PHONE. CAN ANYONE TELL ME WHO TO CONTACT IN REF. TO THIS MATTER. PLEASE THANK YOU."
2,Returned item,I bought two of these for my daughters ages 5 and 10. They never damaged them or misused them. They loved them. That is all the good I am going to write. They battery was heavy and took a long time to recharge. Both chargers died at the same time. Tried finding a new charger and could not. I also tried finding a web site. Found it but is was not fully operational. Would not reccomend this item to anyone. I returned both and will look for a different DVD player. [...]
1,save your money,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas, 2 weeks later it would not charge the battery and we cannot get the battery off so it can be run on the plug."
1,This product is poorly made!!,"We bought one for our former foster daughter for Christmas. We thought she did something wrong when she told us two months later it didn't work.When we got it back there was no power at all. Completely dead machine. I did some research to see if it could be fixed. Unfortunately, I've seen reviews and many others have had the exact same problem.In addition, if you want it repaired, it will cost you $20 and a fortune in shipping charges! We originally paid $129 for this piece of junk!"
1,Buyer Beware!,"Let us jump on the ""stay away from this product"" bandwagaon! Can't find repacement parts (i.e. adapter). Lucky if you get 6 months of use! Manufacturer does't exist. Good luck trying to find them. Even Toys R Us customer service can't locate them!Yet they still carry other products by them, K Group Industries.Shame on Toys R Us for continuing to do business with this company."
1,*Must Read Teen Tech Review***,This item is worthless. I bought this for my daughter and within one month this DVD player broke. I do not recommend this item due to its horrible durability.
2,We had it less than a week,"Bought this for a gift for our daughter. Looked like a really cute machine. The machine literally died after 2 days. Wouldn't run at all. Great while it lasted though! Returned it and will replace it with a different brand today.Another point... this machine is really, really heavy. If you are going to lug this thing around, think twice."
1,terrible product,"I bought this for my son and not only did it quick working after only 4 months but it is very hard to find help with this product. I am having a hard time finding a customer service number to talk to. I will not buy another product by this company because it is so hard to get help from them. By reading the other reviews, I am not the only one. I would give it a rating of 0 if I could. Wasting your money if you buy this product."
1,Think again about buying,"I went crazy trying to find one of these for my daughter for Christmas, and after a whole lot of trouble I finally found one online that they shipped to me for Christmas. It worked great, great picture, great sound. Then the battery died and I tried to recharge it, but it never recharged. I called the company in CA, and they told me it sounded like it was the charger, so they sent me a replacement charger which still had no effect. I was unable to detach the battery from the unit, even though I followed the ""SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS"" included. Stupid me, I through out the original box it came in, soy Toys R Us could only exchange it. The battery is heavy, so my daughter can't carry it herself, and it takes forever to recharge, if you can get it to work. [...] Looked good, but it is a piece of junk, expensive junk."
1,Bad gift from Santa,Santa brought this dvd player to my daughter and she has yet to watch a movie on it. We charged the battery for the required 16 hours and she was able to watch 5 minutes of one movie and the battery died. So we decided that she could watch it while using the AC adapter. It doesn't work!! The player doesn't do anything at all while plugged in. I called the maker today and their suggestion was to return it to the store. So that's what we are doing tonight and we will be purchasing a different one.
1,Info that may help,"I did a little research on this product after my childrens' quit working in the first few months of use. I contacted K Group Industries who I believe manufactures these. They are located in Miami Florida. They are sending me new adaptors, which supposedly will fix the problem. They didn't ask for receipts at all. Their number is 305-576-3339. Hope this helps everyone."
2,Disgruntled,This is a great toy! I purchased it for my teenage son last Christmas - 2004. It worked for 4 months and has not worked since. It was great while it lasted.
3,Does not come with adequate accessories.,This is the first electronic item I have purchased in several years that did not include at least one alternative power source. This device does not come with an a/c adapter and Toys'r us does not sell them in their store.
2,DO NOT BUY,I got this for my B-Day in October and now it is broken. The screen is REALLY small and the sound is horrible a waste of money! Take my advice DO NOT BUY!!!!
4,GGGGGGGGREAT!,This works GREAT!! I use it all the time and even at night when Im not tired i will watch an eposode of something that i bought a seaon on!I REALLY recomend this!!!!
1,Frustrated & Disappointed,"My daughter received this for a Christmas gift, and we thought it was great the 1st few months. It is now completely unresponsive. The battery won't charge. We've had all the same problems as the other reviews state. There's no customer service contact in the manual. To think we had almost bought another one of these for our other daughter,but thankfully upgraded. It's definitely worth it to spend a little more money. Has anyone had any luck getting replacement information for the battery/charger?"
1,TEENTECH,THIS ITEM HAD A GOOD PICTURE BUT I RETURNED ITEM BECAUSE I COULDNT GET THE BATTERY OFF OF THE SYSTEM. ALSO BATTERY IS EXTREMELY HEAVY FOR CHILD TO BE LUGGING AROUND.
2,Disaster with removing the battery.,My child received the portable DVD player for Christmas. After charging the battery for 16 hours we were able to watch a movie from both the AC power and battery. The problem came when we tried to remove the battery it was no way possible to remove the battery. Myself along with my husband tried and were unable to remove the battery. The player was returned the next day.
1,Stay Away,We have never been able to get this to work. I have called and e-mailed K-Tech several times and have NEVER received a response. We tried to return it to Toys R' Us but because we did not have the box or receipt they would not let us return it. I will never buy another item from K-Tech!
1,DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!!!!!,"I bought this portable DVD player for my daughter for Xmas. It never worked. We tried everything. The company suggested rechargable batteries that didn't work. They also suggested to buy an accessory package that costed $29.99 that didn't work.I bought it online and could not return it because it was opened and past the 30 day deadline for returns(I bought it mid-Movember). I talked to Toys R Us and they have agreed to accept it as a return for full refund minus shipping and handling. My daughter was so disappointed, she even cried."
1,If only they allowed a ZERO star rating!,"As with all the other reviews I've read, we received 2 of these for Christmas presents. One worked for 30 seconds, the other didn't work at all! Then we got on line and saw that ours was not the only problem. Thankfully we bought them online through Amazon and they gave us a full refund to go and purchase a working DVD by another company. With all the negative reviews, Toys R Us should pull this junk off the market. It really makes their company look bad. If we could choose our own star rating, it would be way below zero!"
1,teentech porable dvd does not work,I purchased 3 Teen Tech Portable DVD players as christmas gifts for my 3 children. NOT ONE OF THEM WORKS. Three phone calls to the manufacture were not returned (though I was assured my call would be returned within one hour).
2,Shame on Toys R us,"I bought this product for my 6 years old kid, it work for a month. After that, the battery lost its charge and did not get charged. The AC adaptor wont work, the battery not charge, for that reason a portable DVD is not longer portable. Toys R us is responsible for offering a product from a company that does not have any quality control and released a faulty product. Also Toys R us did not take any responsibility for selling this product. I will not buy any other electrical device at Toys R us. In Puerto Rico we always say ""Cheap things are dearest"""
1,"""shame on you""","Bought one for my daughter this christmas (drove over 120 miles to find a store that had one). It worked fine for 4 months until it died of a faulty battery pack and adapter. Could not find a new battery pack to replace the old one. Spoke to other owners and they were all jealous because our's had lasted longer than theirs.Shame on you, for releasing such a poor product during the busy holiday season and leaving the consumer at a loss without recourse afterwards. Next time please test your products for reliability before you release them."
1,Broken after using three times,Very difficult to remove battery pack.Used the player 2-3 times before it stopped working for no apparent reason. Currently looking into exchanging for a new one!
1,Do not buy this product!,"Do not risk your life buying this product. It blew up in front of my son and daughter while charging. By far, this is the most ""shocking"" gift my son ever received. And, this is the last time I buy poor quality item such as this teentech DVD player!"
1,i think this stinks,"i bought this dvd/cd player for my little girl to have as we travel back and forth. it comes with no car adapter, no charger,and i was told by techs that i am not able to use mines because i need rechargeable batteries. which is very expensive. not a good idea for a child or anyone else. think hard before purchasing this booga."
1,Don't buy it,I have owned 2 of them and both only last about 3 months. They have some sort of electronic problem that makes it not recognize the DVD and therefore not play.Tracy
3,It WAS a great idea...until it went kaput!,"I gave this to my kids for Christmas and they thought it was great. It worked great until now (for 4 months) I was plugging it in so my daughter could watch a movie since the battery died and all of a sudden it wouldn't work. I thought I was loosing my mind because it would play for a minute then go dead, even while plugged in. Then all of a sudden I got the shock of my life from the plug. I guess now I realise after reading the reviews that the battery and the plug are dead and it isn't so unusual. I did buy the buyers protection plan so we will see what luck I have filing a claim. Biggest hurdle is I live outside the US, which the guy who sold me it said was no problem at all! We'll see!!!!"
2,portable TV,"This is total trash. We decided to buy a regular car DVD Player, and it was only eighty five dollars and it was a 7 inch screen too. So much better, and even had a car adapter too. Better quality to buy a real one, and worth your money!"
1,Save your money,"I set out to find inexpensive portable DVD players for my boys. They each had $50 Toys R Us gift cards and I figured I would have to give them each $50 extra so the could get their DVD players. I was thrilled to find this DVD player on sale for $49.99. We bought two. I got them all set up in the parking lot of the Toys R Us where I purchased them and by the time I was buckled into my seat belt neither of them would work. The picture dissapeared from both. One of them had subtitles that would not turn off before it lost it's picture. No amount of direction reading, tinkering or technical suppport from Toys R Us staff could help my problem. The only good thing was at least they broke before I got out of the parking lot so I didn't have to make an extra trip to return them. Save your money. I learned that when you but a $50 DVD player, you get a $50 DVD player. God forbid someone should pay the $120+ I've seen them priced at elsewhere."
2,Power Cord failure,My 2 children each received one of these for Christmas. We quickly found out that only one power cord worked. Much to my surprise I just happen to be shopping for car adaptors when I began reading the reviews for these. We never attempted to replace the power cord because we thought the kids me have pulled the wires loose. Now reading that everyone seems to be having the same problem with no help from the manufacturer I plan to take steps to report this to the BBB especially since reading how on two seperate occasions the cords actually blew up. We should all do this we must protect our children from companies who put them in danger. Stay tuned.
1,Two Times Unlucky,My daughter received this DVD/CD Player for Christmas. Weattached the battery and could never get it to release. Wereturned it for a second player which appeared to work for 2 to3 days before it completely died. Do not buy this product!
1,REMEMBER- YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!,I bought this for my son for a present. It worked for a while. Then it just stopped working one day (three weeks after buying). I had it in on the charger for 48 hours (they say 16 hours) and the battery still indicated it was low. [...] They indicated the battery adapter was recalled and that they would send me a new one. I called a couple weeks later after I still had not received. It will take at least a month I was informed. Now two months later I have yet to receive and have left several messages inquiring. I am spending the money I saved on phone calls and aggravation!! I cannot even believe that companies sell this product!!
1,this stinks,bought this for my kids 10 and 14 worked for about a month and know wont charge or play even with the plug. My kids are not rought on this toy so it simply stinks
3,"Difficult Read, Need A Masters Degree","Anything less than an honour student may have trouble. Fairly heavy reading, even for myself (B.Business Finance & Mathematics). Suited to Economics majors."
3,Writing after crashes is easy,"Many causes for financial crashes. All have more or less the same pattern. A lot of publication appear after a crash, who will write before the crash?This book gives good insight into financial chaos."
3,"Relevant, but difficult to read","There is a wealth of great information and insight in this book, but it is organized in a manner that reduces interest and readability. The authors make points and then provide examples from several financial crises, with the result that almost every single page covers multiple events but you never really get a full picture of those events. It is incredibly relevant to the current (2008) crisis, so it is unfortunate the book isn't organized better."
2,Overrated,"Where are the ""hilarious anecdotes, the elegant epigrams, and the graceful turns of phrase"" promised on the back cover? There are valuable insights and ideas, but they are buried in more historical information than needed, and are somewhat disconnected and undeveloped. The material is not particularly well organized, and,like history, the author repeats himself a lot. The writing is awkward and difficult to read in places. However, I did pick up a good many insights and bits and pieces of historical information that are relevant to the current problems in the credit markets. History does repeat itself. Although I think this book is over-rated, if you are a patient reader and a serious student of financial markets, I would recommend it."
4,Its happened before,"The latest financial meltdown is nothing new, we have suffered such panics before and will again. This book gives the reader a good perspective on previous financial follies and helps for understanding the current and future panics. A very readable and enjoyable financial history."
3,ok but boring book,"This is a very informative book, however, it is extremely boring. The writing just makes an interesting topic completely boring.Good book nonetheless and worthy of a read."
4,"Understand why this recession is ""normal""","This is a classic of financial history, written long before the current economic crisis, but nonetheless highly illuminating about current events. You may be very surprised by the similarities of this bust with the many, many that preceded it. This version of the book seems to me less readable than the earlier version I skimmed a few weeks ago, but it will still give the general reader a great historical overview of booms and busts, and help one to be a smarter reader of the news and a more informed voter. Highly recommended for anyone wanting a better understanding of this very important and timely subject."
4,Informative but Remote,"Ed, and Evelyn's reviews state the case that this text is obscure, and poorly organized. Notwithstanding their valid complaints about the author's prose, and the organization of the text, it contains useful knowledge that puts today's circumstances into perspective."
1,TOO EXPENSIVE,"If you go to Rit's website you can get Sunguard for $1.95 for 1 packet, $5.95 for 3 packets or $11.94 for 6 packets. It's a good product, but you don't have to pay this amount!"
