1,I do not recommend this product.,"AudioStation 5.0 by Voyetra Turtle Beach is a waste of money because it offers little more than what the free Microsoft media player has. To me it just seems like a cheep copy of MS media player.Also, I had problems with it crashing under Windows ME. However, it is more stable under Windows XP.One more thing to add is that the tech support took something like 8 business days to respond to very simple questions."
3,Fair and Balanced,"This video was definitely 'fair and balanced'. A great deal of time was given to homosexual 'scholars' to refute the author. In fact, it almost seemed as if the film was being filmed to refute the author. The 'scholars' though did not seem to be genuine. I think they would refute the charges even if their were a museum filled with pictures of Hitler in the act. One argument given that Hitler was not gay was that he was not good looking enough. I thought he was nice looking in pictures of him as a younger man. I do not know what that would have to do with it anyway. Senator Barney Frank is nothing to look at. I was not convinced either way after seeing this film and think I will delve into this subject further by buying the book, Pink Swastika."
5,MY Father-in-Law,"My father-in-Law is now deceased. He was a member of an SS military unit. Everyone in the SS knew about Hitler's sexual proclivities. His personal SS guards would talk; especially when drinking. When Germany annexed Austria, the Gestapo (with the SS) decended on every police station in Vienna in their search for written documents pertaining to Hitler's activities as a homosexual whore while in his 20s."
4,Alternatives a the Social Crime Prevention Theory,"The text outlines a concept of risk and protective factors along the path of life, which are shown to either contribute or protect individuals and communities from Juvenile Offending.The book is a must for those wanting to consider proven and efficient alterntives to the 'get tough approach', but don't fear it isn't the soft social worker approach either. It's based on the theory of Developemental Crime Prevention and looks at a combination of sanctions, interventions and community actions which can reduce juvenile and later adult offending.A must for those with an interst in Crime Prevention !"
3,Mediocre; not nearly as good as its sequel,"I expected a lot from this book because I happened to read the sequel (His Scandal) first. Loved that book, but this one is much less...well, it's just less. Less romance, less intriguing characters, less action and intrigue (which is bad considering Spencer is a spy who's life is in danger), less sensuality, less humor....just less.Rose is, frankly, a strong but rather boring heroine. Spencer isn't all that exciting either. He has his moments, but brother Alex (His Scandal) is so much more...heroic.The plot just never really went anywhere. It seemed repetitious and slow. Just skip this one and go on to His Scandal."
1,It has a beginning and an ending ...,"Maybe it's because I am a fan of the more passionate novels than the ""romantic"" ones (or maybe I just like Medieval romances than Elizabethan romances), but this novel did not seem that at all interesting. Roselyn seemed too meek around the time she came face to face with the fiance she jilted (thirty years later!), and the fact that Spencer Thorton came to the wedding drunk made me lose interest in the hero. There didn't seem to be enough suspense or surprises. I am not knocking the book all together, but it just did not seem to capture much interest for me while something a little more, ahem, sensual like Samantha James' ""Truest Heart"" (where a ship crashes and the washed-ashore hero ends up being nursed back to health by the heroine). To each their own."
1,Cheesy product,"STYROFOAM.... VERY CHEAP LOOKING AND NOT WORTH THE MONEY. ALSO.... NON-REFUNDABLE... SO YOU ARE STUCK WITH THIS HIDEOUSLY AND UGLY STAND.The picture is not a fair representation of the product. It appears the picture is of low quality or enhanced for better appearance. BUT, I can assure you it looks just like styrofoam. The exact kind that is used to ship stereo equipment in the box. The cardboard columns look like papertowel roll left overs.NOT WORTH IT... AVOID THIS PRODUCT!!!"
5,Love,Can't wait to wear yet black ones I orderd with skirts in spring I wear them now over my tights
4,"Warm and soft, strange fit","I just received these yesterday. They are soft, and incredibly warm. I do have some issues with fit; I have large-ish thighs, and these become a little tight when I pull them up to their full length. The fit around the ankle is semi-loose,but this is good for warmth and flexibility. I haven't had any issue with unraveling yet, and they seem pretty standard. They come up to mid thigh, maybe a bit higher, and I am 5'5"". I am mostly satisfied; I can wear these with shorts even during winter, and my legs are fine."
1,"""good condition""???","This purchase was made for a friend that had literally worn out his copy of this very book. I knew I was buying a used book but was very dissapointed when it arrived and it was not in ""good condition"" as discribed. The book was worn and didn't even have it's back cover. The binding was held together with clear tape and pages were worn and soiled from use. Take a closer look at your books when you are rating their quality."
3,not bad,it works ok. it's not as much airflow that i thought it was going to be. but it works just fine. I thought also that it had it's own plug. it has a usb plugin.
5,ONE OF THE BEST LIVE ALBUMS EVER RECORDED!,"This album ranks as one of the best soul live albums of all time!! It is right up there with Earth, Wind & Fire's ""Gratitude"" album. This CD has all the AWB jams we all love. ""Cut the cake"", ""If I ever lose this heaven"", ""Schoolboy Crush"", ""TLC"" and an incredible 18+ minute set of the alltime AWB favorite ""Pick up the pieces"". I kind of wish they put ""Soul Searching"" and ""A Love of our own"" on this CD but there plenty of hits to keep you in a definite funk groove. The sound is crisp and clear and still rocks as great today as they did making this album in '76. A MUST FOR ANY TRUE AWB FAN!"
5,"Wow, Good Memories","Good memories and a great live performance. If you like AWB, don't miss out on this one!"
5,Luv AWB,"Excellent CD-I have played it almost daily for a month! Love that Hamish Stuart. He's doing his own thing now, but the replacements on the drums and lead singer belong right where they are. There is no change in the excellent sound of AWB even though only two original members remain. If you can, go see them in concert yourself. AMAZING"
3,Would have liked if it were larger.,"Product was shipped quickly. I ordered two swords so they were package together in a larger box and one had punched thru its inner box with the tip of the sword. Smaller than I would have liked. Blade is very narrow at most an inch. The hilt is also only plastic, not quality but what you'd expect for $20."
5,C'est simplement incroyable,By far the best book I have ever read.. I was also wondering if it has been published in English.
5,French 200/201,Liked the product. Very good condition. No writing whatsoever. Recommend it to students who are studying French and want to read a good book(:
3,An O.K. Pro Am Wrestling movie,"This truly is an alright movie about bar room wrestling, no real plot or story but good fun. Justin Whalin, main character, plays a teenage guy who works at a sports bar and wants to be a pro wrestler, so he can seek fortune, fame, and that one special girl. His partner, Zachary Thomas I think (the older kid from Home Improvement), wants it all as well and does what he can to put Justin in the spotlight. In order to do so he must defeat his rival and be trained by his idol and hero (Sasha Mitchell), you know Cody from the 90's sitcom Step By Step, that's how I will always see him. But the movie is OKAY for real, lots of T&A nudity and cheesy jokes, eye candy and wrestling BTS exposure. WRESTLING IS PREDETERMINED NOT A WAY TO SETTLE BEEF !? A must rent for indie underground wrestling fans, who dream of wrestling one day see where must wrestlers really start !!"
1,unhappy,"I am very upset. I ordered this item in August for a class I am going to be taking a few weeks later. When I ordered the book, it said it would be here by a certain date, so I ordered. When I got the confirmation, it said it wont be here for a whole month later. I am VERY upset, because I have assignments due, and no book to do them with."
3,Oddly parochial title ...,"If this book is only about the US health service, why doesn't the title say so? There are quite a few other countries out there in the world, and almost all of them have health services!"
2,not the best intro to health services,"This book is not very well suited to those who want an introduction to health policy and services. If you have some background in the field, it will probably be too basic to help you very much. I had no such background when I began using this book in a graduate course in health policy, and while most of the text is understandable, it is generally not very interesting and/or helpful. I suppose it's a good thing that the book and chapters are brief, however it leaves out a lot of details that I felt would be beneficial towards understanding a very complex system. When statistics are used to exemplify a point, they are generally pretty dated. Even if a new edition were available though, I'd read through a chapter or two in the library before investing in this book."
5,Exceeded expectations,"This is the first time I've ordered a textbook online. My concerns with online was either I wouldn't receive it quickly enough, or the condition would be less than adequate. I received the book within 4 business days of ordering it even though I chose the 5-8day shipping. Also, the book was said to be ""used in good condition"". I can't find a single page that doesn't look like it's brand new. My university bookstore doesn't sell used books in this good of condition and I can't remember the last time I only paid $30 for a textbook. If the buyback process through Amazon works just as well, I'll probably be buying all my books through these guys from here on. I'll try to remember to update my review at the end of the semester when I sell the book back."
3,introduction to health services book review,"this book was ok, informative but just ok. this was my first class for a masters in healthcare administration. this book was very informative about the different health services we have in the U.S. a little like a review from a few of my undergrad classes. So overall, the class was easy, and the book was easy to read and follow."
4,Good but...,"This is a nice kit. Very clean looking and I noticed smoother acceleration without feeling the engine struggle. Seemed more effortless. K&N makes good products, but with this kit they should improve the directions a bit for installation. There's not a whole lot of detail in the poor black and white directions that say put this here with the supplied hardware so it leaves you guessing as what to do. Some of the pieces were difficult to join and took a bit of work to get them to fit. But overall it's pretty nice."
3,"Good for a brief overview, but I wouldn't call it a ""Guide""","A book that calls itself a guide should be full of information that the reader can take and use on his/her own. This book has a good overview of finances, but it does a poor job of relating one branch of finance to another. There is no building of knowledge for the reader, so it is as if you are reading a different book on each page. For a book issued by the Wall Street Journal, I was rather disappointed."
3,Not Good,Was not so impressed with the content. Thought there would be more information on the subject. Don't waste your money or time. I can see why it only cost one cent.
5,Take It From A Divorce Lawyer,As an attorney and divorce mediator in New York and New Jersey I try to keep up on all of the children's books put out on the topic of divorce - in order to give my clients recommendations. This book is WITHOUT A DOUBT the best book for young children on the topic. It doesn't try to get too into the topic (like Dinosaur's divorce - which is better for kids a bit older) and stresses the two (2) most important themes for children experiencing divorce to learn: (1) some things are changing - but many things are staying the same; (2) you didn't do anything to cause it - and you can't do anything to stop it. This is a GREAT book and a great resource for professionals working in divorce to recommend.
2,"This book is very slanted towards ""Daddy leaving""","I bought this book for my stepchildren when they were about 2 years old. The book comes highly recommended from other users on Amazon, but if you are looking for a book that portrays both parents in an equal light, this is not the book for you. I found this book to be extremely slanted towards portraying an image in which ""Daddy leaves."" I haven't found it applicable to our situation at all. A better recommendation would be ""Two Homes"" by Claire Masurel. This book is a favorite of ours and you can expect a fair representation of both parents- emphasis is given to building an environment of love and belonging at two homes.Two Homes"
1,Way out of date and not great for Papa Bear,"This book is ridiculous. It assumes that Dad is only there on weekends, except when he doesn't show up. Good grief. Inappropriate for shared custody situations, or fathers who have full custody. Disappointing that we have not evolved and that stereotypes are perpetuated."
4,better than nothing,"This book is pretty well done but a little dry and seems better for a 3-5 year old level. No 8 year old is going for this, come on. Also the dad in the book only gets visitation. As I'm a dad with custody who would never leave my child, I took a pen and swapped ""mama"" and ""daddy"" in the book. I also added a page about mommy leaving her family to shack up with tattooed biker bear (just kidding)."
1,didn't live up to my expectations,unfortunately this product didn't provide a useable interface or the necessary introductory information to even get started learning the language.
4,Covers just the first model but it's crowded with fact and nice stories,I've just bought a Z4 and I love that car. It was my dream car for years... I was looking for a book telling the entire story of that marvellous car. This is almost perfect. What is missing is just a couple of photos of the latest 2006 restyling and related facts and figures.I'm waiting for the new release of the book ;-)
5,"If you have this car, get this book.","Great book if you are a lover of the Z4, or BMW automobiles. Offers great insight into the build and design process that helps you appreciate the engineering and quality that goes into every BMW."
4,Fast and almost new,"It's very fast delivered and it looks almost new. Since I've borrowed this book from library, I already know this book is quite helpful to understand how to apply countinng process to survival analysis."
1,Horrible,Could not even finish it...so horrible and so lame. I love cheesy horror but this was just way too slow and stupid.
1,A Little Fact Checking Goes A Long Way...,"The ONLY reason this movie even rates one star is for its soundtrack. Other than that, it was a complete waste of time. The opening scene has a guy in MOTORCYCLE boots apparently searching southern China and finding a grave with an amulet (not to mention a fake skull - closed eye sockets?). From that lame point on, the movie declines into a total mess. The story is never believable and the reality/fantasy mix is TERRIBLE. Random teleportation throughout the movie? Police crime scene team ""misses"" a HUGE charm necklace in the space of a bathroom stall? Come on! What should I have expected from a movie staring an outspoken Wiccan? The movie further insults other religions in furtherance of its plot. Terrible. Just Terrible."
3,Not that good,"Ok, I have to say it, I got this movie to see it, and unfortunately, I am not a big fun of horror movies, so watching this movie was not the most exciting thing to do. I really didn't like it, the effect are not the best. I have to say that something good must have because I did watch the whole thing, it is just that I still can't make up my mind what it was.*Sponsored Post"
5,Bouquets of creativity!,"This is a very easy and very beautiful kit that teaches some wonderful creative skills by doing!Watercolor pencil drawings are transformed into beautiful watercolor paintings when you deftly apply a wet artist's brush. You can make a little gallery of awesome little nature pictures with vibrant colors, some with 3-D effects, glittery outlines and more.After completing the projects in this kit, young (and old) artists will come away with a new skill that can be applied to any other art projects they devise.This is a highly recommended, lovely and educational item!"
1,Amazingly bad resolution,"I must confess that I've never read anything by Lydia Adamson before. I was hoping for a moderately interesting light hearted mystery. The book was a quick read -- but the resolution was appalling.The solution doesn't make any sense at all. The motives ascribed are amazingly bad, the murder itself makes no sense. Several plot threads dealing with the victim are completely ignored. The person who commits the murder may be the last person you suspect -- not because of any brilliant plotting but because the resolution makes so little sense.As a mystery, this book fails utterly. Characterization of the lead character and her boyfriend is OK, everyone else gets almost no characterization. I suppose a genuine cat lover might find some of the description of the cat antics in this book charming. I like cats, but I do not find these to be any substitute for a good plot."
1,Save your money,"NOT 100% cotton, says polyester right on the tag. Toy is tiny for the price. My son could care less about it (I keep trying) and far prefers other things for teething. This is overpriced misrepresented crap in my opinion. Total rip off."
3,$15.00 for this?,This toy is just not that interesting to my 4 month old. It seems overpriced for being just a piece of cloth with a wooden ring. Maybe he will like it more as he gets older.... It is awfully cute though.
1,Stooge-style slapstick is way below par for the series,"This late Blondie entry (1949) has Dagwood as a clumsy laborer on a construction site. The director of this film usually wrote and directed Three Stooges comedies, and it shows. The obvious slapstick doesn't fit the ""Blondie"" situation-comedy format at all. Arthur Lake as Dagwood does his best with the material, and there are a few laughs, but fans of the series will probably be disappointed. Try another episode first."
4,Glen Rogers Serial Killer Book Review,"Having read the other two books on Glen Rogers, this was well-written and researched. It did not focus nearly as much on the specific trauma within his earlier childhood that I was expecting, but did not bore you with unreliable details."
2,Didn't Like It,"I'm a year late (and 15 dollars short) with this. But, in case Mr. Nasmith comes out with a new calendar, I just wanted to add one dissenting opinion to all the glowing ones. Nasmith's landscapes are OK, but any facial closeups seem...well, sort of warped, especially Sam's and Eowyn's. Nitpicking? Maybe. But perhaps it's telling that none of these facial views are included on the back cover ""preview""."
5,Easiest & Best Coffee Cakes & Quick Breads by Renny Darling,"This is, by far, the most treasured cookbook in my collection. I have tried nearly every recipe in the book, and they are all excellent. I bake regularly for my family and friends, and have a reputation as being a ""fantastic"" baker, and it's all because of Renny Darling's fabulous recipes. The instructions are clear, easy to read and follow, and the outcome is always perfect. There are wonderful recipes for banana breads, cranberry breads, pumpkin breads, as well as cakes, muffins, and scones. Renny also indicates how to change cooking time to adapt quick bread recipes to muffins, or cakes and vice versa. You will not be disappointed in this ""Cake Bible."""
5,Most often used cookbook in my collection!,"Out of the hundreds of cookbooks that I have, this one is reached for most often. Easy to follow instructions, no fussy equipment needed and the muffin and quick bread recipes have won me rave reviews! Well worth the money!"
1,Clouded Tank Badly.,"Tried these for my 125 gallon Gold Fish tank. They ended up causing cloudiness in my tank. I was not overfeeding either, before somebody chimes in. I never had this problem before using them, and have never had it since I stopped."
5,An Interesting and Well-Written Novel,"Accidents in the Home is an interesting and well-written novel--an examination of human relationships and the various ""accidents"" made in these relationships. Clare Verey a 29 year old married woman is the focal point of the novel, with chapters alternating between her story and those of the various members of her extended family--half brother, stepmother, father, etc. Each character has his or her faults and foibles exposed to us. May of the characters seem to naturally gravitate to the wrong type of person, the wrong type of relationship. When I read back the words I have just written, I realize that I have painted a rather bleak picture of a definitely unbleak novel. Accidents in the Home is quite an enjoyable read, well-told and engaging. The characters are likeable, their flaws, forgivable. Enjoy."
2,Too many people behaving randomly,"Synopsis: Too many characters, though very few are particularly interesting, admirable or deep, behaving randomly.Clare, the protagonist, breaks up her family for an affair, though it is never clear that she is really dissatisfied or with what exactly. The object of the affair then promptly evaporates as a character. Her husband turns to her former best friend, even though it's made clear that they don't really like each other or have anything in common. After this, they also reappear only briefly and superficially. Hadley drops hints of some real issues (Clare's mother-in-law's insomnia, Tamsin's cutting herself, Naomi's drinking) but then fails to follow up, leaving the reader to wonder at their being mentioned at all.Better books on motherhood's frustrations include Rachel Cusk's A Life's Work and Karen Karbo's Motherhood Made a Man Out of Me"
2,I wanted to like this book...,"but I didn't. I liked the idea of this book, but found it very hard to follow. The characters were somewhat one-dimensional and there were sooo many of them! The author kept jumping from person to person and story to story making it difficult to keep up with who is speaking to whom! Overall a pretty bleak look on marriage and relationships."
1,Past Page One?,"I could not make it past the second page. Her writing style is horrible. Who doesn't use quotations? There are literary rules for a reason- some things are not to be ""creatively"" changed. It just takes away from the story."
2,"For a thin blanket, somewhat heavy.","When the box arrived I had to double check that correct item had been shipped. The shipping weight on the box said 6 lbs but I wasn't sure what the box or vinyl storage unit it was in additionally weighed.First we inserted it into the flannel duvet we had and found it really weighed down the medium Pacific Coast down comforter we already had. We had hoped this blanket would add just a little more warmth without much extra weight.Even out of the duvet it still is heavy, almost the feel of a medium weight wool blanket. For us, it defeats the wonderful feel of our original comforter.I grew up on farms so I remember the old heavy quilts and blankets we had, so I can personally deal with the extra weight. But my wife just can't adjust to the heaviness of this combination. We will investigate instead Pacific Coast's lightest comforter and send this item back."
4,The Missing Years,"If you're wondering what happened between Do Wah Diddy Diddyand Blinded By The Light, then this is the CD to buy.This CD has the best sounding version of The Mighty Quinnthat I've ever heard (besides bringing back fond memories).There's many odd cover versions of songs here, but it's agreat value for a double CD set. I'd also recommend EMI'sThe Best Of Manfred Mann, The Definitive Collection, fortheir earlier hits....and Warner Archives' The Best of ManfredMann's Earth Band for hits like Blinded By The Light."
3,It could have been better but it will do!,"Living in the Uk I had to get onto Amazon to get hold of this album with any ease..what do I think of it? It's OK,it ain't great, maybe I was expecting too much but then again it's better than a lot of stuff that is given the label ""soul"" nowadays.She can sing the pants off any modern day soul singer but I just cant help wondering what she could do with some really great material. A whole Jam & Lewis album would do it!Trouble is, this album is a grower. On first listen I wasn't that impressed but as time goes by it's starting to grow.The biggest disappointment? I was looking for a couple of uptempo tunes like ""Save the overtime"" or ""When you're far away"" , but alas it's not to be.Put it this way, if you like Gladys you should buy it, it won't be your favourite album of hers but it does deserve to be in your collection."
1,"Disappointing schmaltz, a waste of a great talent.","Gladys is one of my very favorite singers; I can't begin to voice how disappointed and saddened I am by her choice of music on this CD. Schmaltzy, treacle-y pap, not very interesting, and not using her fantastic vocal skills to the best benefit. I hope she turns her career around."
5,WOW/// WHAT A ALBUM,"WOW WHAT A ALBUM . I AM THE BIGGEST PATTI LABELLE FAN AND A BIG GLADYS KNIGHT FAN. THIS ALBUM IS GOOD TO THE LAST DROP . GLADYS KNIGHT HAS REINVENT HERSELF . THIS IS HER GREATEST ALBUM EVER . IT HAS SONGS FOR EVERYBODY . SONGS LIKE ""LOVE HURTS AND IT DON'T"" , AND THE FOLLOWING SONG W/ JAMIE FOXX IS FOR THE NEW AGE PEOPLE. THEN SHE HAS ""PLEASE HELP ME I'M FALLING IN LOVE W/ U"" . THIS SONG IS FOR THE OLD SCHOOL R&B FANS. THEN YOU HAVE THE SONG ""THE GREATEST LOVE OF ALL"" FOR HER NEW CHRISTIAN BASED FANS. I LOVE EVERY SONG OFF THIS ALBUM . THIS MAKES ME WANT TO GO PURCHASE ANY ALBUM OF HERS THAT I DON'Y HAVE ALREADY . THIS IS A MUST HAVE . GOOD JOB GLADYS KNIGHT . U ARE TRULY A QUEEN OF SOUL /// ALONG SIDE ARETHA AND PATTI ."
2,The great soul singer is back !,"A welcomed return of the timeless songstress.Best tunes;""If I were your woman II""""I said you lied""."
1,Disappointing,My first book for these authors. I was looking for Pratchett like wit. Found no wit at all. I felt it was a 30 page story padded with irrelevance.
3,"Can't match Rats, Bats & Vats","I really wanted to enjoy the book, both because I loved Rats,Bats & Vats and because I'm a bit of a mythology buff myself and would enjoy a good parody, well-founded in Graeco-Egyptian lore.In fact I did enjoy the book - up until the final 1 or 2 chapters. The plot holes, outright inconsistency (within the framework of the book's sub-creation and internal ""logic"") and rushed feeling ruined what was a fun 4-5star book up 'til then.Too bad."
3,Odd but intriguing first effort,"My first exposure to this talented author was ""Elsewhere"", which I highly recommend. Because I loved her writing style, I decided to pick up her first book. It was completely different and not necessarily in a good way.It was so odd that I'm not sure I even know how to describe it. Margarettown is a physical place, yet somehow a symbolic representation of the many facets of a woman's personality. Sounds a bit strange, right? It is. Parts of it work well....and other parts were confusing and seemed disjointed. I'd love an author explanation of what she meant!I'd read ""Elsewhere"" again, but this book - no. Skip it or, if you must, read a library copy. She *is* a talented author so I'll be looking for her next release, coming soon!"
1,If it weren't for the wealth of knowledge...,"this video wouldn't be worh it...as the production/image quality is so 1980'sish, that you can't belive that twenty years later Wayne is still selling this video. If I had three wishes, 1) I would wish for a dramatic price reduction in this video 2) I would wish Wayne to produce a new set of videos with all digital equipment & footage. 3) Sell it at the price we're paying for this current video."
3,LTB's,"LTBs 1 and 2 are outdated video, but LTB 1 gives good info on how to make the calls at the end of the DVD. LTB 2 gives tactical information/strategies. Both are simple videos, but work."
5,THESE ARE MY FAVORITE ATHLETIC SHOES,"These shoes have awesome traction and look great. If they ever wear out, I would buy them a gain in a second. Removable spikes are a nice bonus, but I genreally use them indoor on my elliptical or outdoor for walking."
4,Dance music variety,"A good, 3-CD compilation of disco, old school R&B and funk, 80s Hi-NRG, and popular club dance hits."
4,Very Good Cooler,"This cooler has 4 fans with speed control and the on/off switch. I've had this cooler on my 17"" laptop for almost 2 years and it still runs great. My laptop is on 24/7 and I haven't had a problem with it at all. If it starts to get noisy, it means it needs the dust vacuumed off, for as long as it's been running, it's well worth the money."
3,Just ok,"This is my third different laptop cooler purchase. I would have to say my Antec is still the best at cooling. This would place third. It cools ok but the low to high graduated switch does not give me any more cooling power at least that I notice. My laptop still runs warm after being on for an extended period. So I will continue to use this if a second laptop is on, but will grab my antec first."
3,Adequate,"This will insulate your legs from the heat of the laptop. However, it is bulky and slippery. It is worth the price if you want just basic isolation from the laptop."
1,Cheap - Pay for a better one,Bought unit for cooling a DVR and within a few months one fan started to make a scraping noise.The housing started to impede the fan blade.The unit is too inexpensive to bother returning or dealing with warranty.Suggest you pay for a solid brand name with exchangeable fans.
1,Extremely poor customer service,"Shortly after I received this Notebook Cooler, I accidentally damaged the power supply cable. After checking the local electronics and computer supply stores I discovered this 12"" cable is unique to this product, or at least to StarTech. I searched their web site, which offers a wide variety of cables, but this particular cable was not listed. So I contacted the company directly by telephone. They informed me they would not provide a replacement cable. The only solution was for me to purchase a totally new notebook cooler. In other words, their idea of customer service was for me to spend another $28 instead of maybe $4. With service like this, I would never recommend purchasing any product from StarTech."
2,Too large for my laptop,"Cooler was received in great condition; however, a little too large for my laptop and didn't cool as much as I wanted it to. I'm sure for a larger laptop it would have worked fine. I was able to return without a problem. Two stars."
3,Not that great.,"I should have just dropped the extra cash for a Zalman. That's what I ended up doing after a few months. This cooler has fairly high volume fans, but it's a ""puller"" rather than a ""pusher"" design. Fans that blow air toward the computer are much more effective. This notebook cooler works decently, but it's a bit flimsy (made of plastic), and it's not as effective as my Zalman NC1000 (which has an aluminum plate on top). However, there is one advantage. While the inlets for the fan are on the top, the outlets are on the sides rather than the bottom. If you use the computer on your lap, it's much easier for the hot air to escape. I appreciated this feature, but learned to work around the disadvantage of having bottom intakes when I bought my newer cooler."
2,unsatisfied,"I liked it at first because it kept my mac very cool & quiet. But after a few months it started to get louder. It's too bad, because that's the only thing I don't like about it. It's very difficult to concentrate on schoolwork with the rattling of the noisy fans. I am thinking about writing the company & seeing what they say/do about it. Nice fan -- if it would just keep quiet, I'd give it 4 or 5 stars..."
2,Fans started making clicking noises,It was a good unit for about an hour. One of the fans just got louder and louder. I guess I'll return and buy a brand name. I had high hopes!
3,Please note...,This is a very tiny mini book. I expected it to be a regular full size book. I was planning on using it as a teaching tool but it is way too tiny to use during group instruction with a class.
2,Hard to install,This product is very hard to install and instructions are not clear. Spent days on end trying to get it hooked up right. I would recommend going with the cycle country plows. They are more durable and not as many moving parts to make work.
1,JUNK!,Do not waste your money. The temperature reading is erratic and inaccurate. Just does not work as it claims.
1,Can't get consistent readings,"I followed the directions but every time a took a reading it gave me different results, often by a degree or more. I sent it back."
2,not accurate as far as I can tell,The visiting nurse and I compared readings with our thermometers and our impression is that it is not accurate or reliable
1,uptrodden,I don't know if the product even works as it is impossible to even insert the batteries. (4 people tried per the instructions to open the temporal scanner for insertion of battery - none could get it open). So much for quality control. One can only wonder if this product is made by toy manufacturers in China or the quality people had one to many the day my temporal scanner was produced. Forget temporal - it was a permanent product screw up
1,Hunk of crap,"This thing is outright garbage...I used this thing 4 or 5 times before it just quit workingIt was never dropped or mishandled, the batteries were newPure junkPure junkPure junkClear enough ?"
2,"Simply put, just plain inaccurate.","I figured out the problem with this thermometer. It's not about how you use it, it's about on who it's used. If I use it on my younger daughter (age 5), it's fairly accurate; measuring mostly 98.6. If I use it on myself (age not divulged), it's always at least a degree too cool (97.4). If I use it on my older daughter (age 7), it's almost always about a degree too high (99.4). These results are almost without fail, and can be expected if I take all our temperatures one after another, in varying orders or at different times of the day. As a result, because it's so expensive, we still use it, but I take the reading and subtract/add according to the regular readings I get. I'm surprised that this hasn't been mentioned before."
2,Inaccurate readings,"I loved this at first. My first one broke and I must say they had EXCELLENT customer service and sent me a replacement thermometer very quickly. However, the readings do not seem to be accurate. I took my son's temp and then the pediatrician took it with their heavy duty thermometer - it was off by almost 3 degrees!!! For this reason I am looking into finding another alternative."
2,All over the map,"It's really a great concept and if it worked would be worth the money if it gave an accurate reading. My 2 year old is scared of it. Probably thinks some big needle will poke her in the forehead. If we're lucky to get a reading, the temp is about 4-10 degrees lower than actual. I read myself and it's low. Something that is designed to be easy to use should be calibrated out of the box. I'll keep working at it, but I'd save your money and go old school thermometer."
4,Love it!,"I love this thermometer for my baby. It is so much easier than the ear thermometers, and we get the same reading no matter how many times I do it. It's definitely worth the money considering how many other thermometers I've had to toss."
1,Works great except when child has a fever,"Had tried lots of other thermometers and thought this was the best thing since apple pie for the same reasons everyone else says (easy, consistent, fast, etc.), especially since my daughter has febrile seizures and we monitor her for any sign of fever. We were so happy with it that we threw away our other thermometers, and bought it as gifts for other friends with kids. But it was inconsistent when we needed it - when my daughter had a fever.Apparently it becomes inconsistent with the slightest forehead moisture which of course happens with a fever. It did not register the correct temperature making it difficult to know what was happening with my daughter's fever. We were not aware her temperature was as high as it was and she had a febrile seizure.We threw it away and now use the Braun thermoscan for the past 3 years which provides the best readings and consistency of any thermometer we have tried."
4,Listen to a mom of 3 who has used it for several years!,"A few quick things, since there are several reviews:1. make sure you peel off the plastic covering first2. read and follow the directions***3. MOST IMPORTANTLY, the reading will be higher if you/your child was sleeping on the side that you are scanning. Think about it... you are warmer when your head is up against the pillow, so just make sure you realize that. If you aren't sure, scan towards both sides and take the average or lower reading.Hope this helps! Wishing everyone good health and that you don't have to use it as much as we have!"
2,Inconsistent thermometer,"Bummer...thought this made our life with young kids so much easier, but recently had an unfortunate situation. Our child had a fever but the exergen kept reading around 105.5, my husband knew with user error we needed to take his temperature numerous times, but it consistently read around 105.5. Off to urgent care we went where his temp read 101. So, I would recommend having an alternative thermometer around."
2,"Seems like a good idea, but frustrating in real life","We have had one of these for several years. It does work, but:1) it seems to read low, and inconsistently. I end up confirming the result with another kind of thermometer, or I just add a degree or two. Not really ideal.2) it can be hard to do the forehead swiping if your child has a lot of hair, if your child is at all squirmy or resistant, or if you're even the slightest bit uncoordinated, because you have to hold it flat against the skin and press a button the whole time. Often we get error readings and have to try again, which the squiry child hates even more.3) There's no backlight, so doing it in the dark is awkward.4) it beeps, with no option to turn it off, so if you're checking a sleeping child, better hope s/he is a deep sleeper."
4,Works well for us!,"I was tired of the under-arm thermometers. I read about this product and decided to get it. I love it! I use it on my baby, toddler and ourselves. I'm paranoid about it being consistent so I always take 3 sequential readings. As long as I properly swipe the forehead (proper place, no hair, no sweat), the readings are extremely close to each other. This thermometer is great and I would recommend it."
1,Expensive Junk,"ZERO stars. I just threw this one away because it's too much of a pain to try and get my money back. The range of readings it gives (on the same person, readings taken one right after the other) is HUGE! On a ""healthy"" child I just got the following five readings: 99.4, 95.1 96.2 98.8 and 97.1 Utterly useless. Don't waste your money.N.B. I DID take off the protective cover. I DID follow the instructions. I DID wait for the beep. I used it in the day, under a low-stress situation, on a cooperative child. In the dark, late at night, when you're panicked and the child is sweating and crying, and your expensive, high-tech thermometer turns out to be useless, just getting your money back won't be much consolation. I'm seriously wondering if the people that rated this 5 stars got paid by the manufacturer to do so."
2,Not recommended my peds,"I bought this thinking it was easy to use on my toddler and infant. When I told the pediatrician it was what I was using to take their temperatures, he told me it gives very inconsistent readings. It can be off as much as 1.5 degrees! He said the ear thermometers were more accurate."
2,Exergen Temporal Thermometer,"Great thermometer for accuracy, but ease is lost. The thermometer must stay in contact with the forehead in order to scan correctly. On wiggly toddlers, this is not easy! I originally bought it so I could scan for their temperatures while they are sleeping...not so easy! It takes a little getting used to, I've only found one ""technique"" with it to work and it's pretty awkward! I would rather have an ear thermometer which would be much easier, but less effective; or a rectal thermometer which is right on with accuracy, but more cumbersome to use!!!Do not recommend this thermometer; if not scanned properly, then your result could be off several degrees!"
5,Love This Thermometer!,"I love this thermometer (got mine at Costco)! We have been using it accurately since my daughter was two weeks old. She is now six months old.It's the same thermometer that my daughter's pediatrician uses (and was recommended by my nurse in the hospital in place of a rectal thermometer). When I first got it, I was having some issues with the accuracy. So... When my daughter had her two week check up, I took my thermometer with me and asked her pediatrician to show me how to properly use it. It turned out that it had been giving us inaccurate readings because my baby was sweaty (summer time with no AC in the house) when I was using it. If your baby is sweaty, use it behind your baby's ear. The only other way it gives an inaccurate reading is if you pull it away from your baby's head before you let go of the button. Now that I've had tons of practice, I never get an inaccurate reading!"
4,I would buy another.,"Great item. A bit awkward to handle and depress the button simultaneously. However, much better than trying to get a fussy kiddo to sit still when sick while trying use the ear or oral thermometer versions."
5,A Mommy Must Have,"My daughter is so squirmy that it's impossible for me to get a good read on her temp. I've gone so far as taking her to the Pediatrician just so I can have an ""expert"" do it. We've tried most gadgets on the market and this is by far the best. It is not only easy, but accurate. All you do is scan the temple area between eye and ear and you have a temp reading. My sister in law is a Pedatric Optamologist surgeon and my friend is an RN. They recommended this item to us as a MUST. You will have it forever, so invest in it now -- before you have to overnight it when your baby has a fever!"
2,Not accurate,Love the idea of this but failed to deliver. Was getting different readings when taken on the same person within minutes. Then after awhile started getting error message more often than not. Then it just stopped working.
3,Handy Thermometer,This is a handy thermometer for when they're sleeping or fussy (which tends to happen when they're sick). My only problem was that the readings seem to jump around sometimes. It might be user error. Trying to hold a baby and press a thermometer to her head wasn't always easy. It was however a lot easier than holding a thermometer under her arm or making her really mad an using it elsewhere.
1,Great idea that doesn't work well,"This sounded like a potential improvement over the ear thermometer that gives you inconsistent readings and is sensitive to the fact that you may have been lying down on one ear, ending up in an overly high reading. Well, this forehead thermometer is considerably less consistent than the ear one. It gives you a different reading every time, doesn't work at all if you're even the least bit sweaty, and it's unclear when it's done taking a reading. What a shame and what a terrible waste of time. This one is going back to the store."
3,Some good and some not so good.,It is hard to get a childs temperature reading. This device makes it easy to get a reading. The downside is that the reading is not very accurate. You can get a different reading depending on which side of the forehead you take. One side could day the child's temperature is 100.2 and the other 90.3. If you want an accurate reading find another thermometer.
2,Not good for diagnostic,"We just used this earlier today to our son and we got a reading of 104Now that he is sleeping, we used a cheaper armpit thermometer and we got 102Out of curiosity we again used this exergen thermometer and got 104.5I therefore recommend having an extra armpit thermometer to diagnose your kid before calling the pediatrician.This forehead thermometer should only be used for quick screening when the child is uncooperative."
1,The Pediatric Nurse laughed!,"The title of my review says it all. After ending up in the hospital when our newborn had a high fever, I decided I needed to have something which could ACCURATELY give me our kids temperatures, something I could TRUST. I shot out to the local Target (did not buy this from Amazon) and returned with this! The Nurse took a look, had a laugh, and said, ""Good luck with that thing.""Does not give accurate temps. Does not give consistent temps. Basically worthless. A shame, I had high hopes for this thing... Turns out you're better off sticking a glass vial filled with poisonous mercury up your kids pooper, as I feared."
1,"Inaccurate, waste of money","7 out of 10 scans say ""error"" and the scans that do get a reading differ each time. 99.4, 98.6, 99.7... I've read the instructions a dozen times and know it's not a user error. Also a selling point for me was that it could be used while our baby is sleeping. It leaves red marks on his forehead and plastic is too hard and requires just enough pressure to wake him. So it can't be used while he is asleep. I thought we just had a lemon but my sister has the same one and has the same problems."
2,Meh it's ok..,"It works, randomly. I usually get a different reading every time and also the back never stays on. Would look into other ones before purchasing this one."
2,Great in theory... too bad it doesn't work,"I thought this would be a great purchase, but I have been very disappointed. The thermometer gives inconsistent readings. I can check three or four times and have the readings vary by as much as a degree. Other times, the readings are absurdly low. I once had a reading of 98.4 with this device, but a traditional thermometer read 101.8. Not even close. I have found that running the thermometer over the artery in the neck rather than the artery in the forehead provides a more accurate result."
4,"Easy to use, not so accurate reading","This is perfect when the child is wiggly and won't let you take the under the arm temperature. However, the temperature reading was not consistent compared to the under the arm thermometer."
4,Better than ear thermometer,"Have used one of these for a couple of years now. May not the most accurate, but it's as accurate as ear thermomter and easier to use. Only complaint is it could really use a lighted display for night time use."
4,Works very well,"I really like this thermometer. It works great and is easy to use. I follow the recommendation of taking a temp 2-3 times to average out the readings. They are never too far off...maybe .1 or .2 off. I don't have anything bad to say about it. I wish it didn't beep until it was done with the reading or something, but it doesn't bother me and doesn't make me wish I didn't buy it. It is far easier than using the ear or mouth thermometers. My Drs office uses thermometers like this (more advanced model) so if it is good enough for them, it is good enough for me."
3,Not what others make it out to be,I bought it for my baby. This thing is completely inaccurate. I could check her temperature 10 times in 30 seconds and the readout will differ each time. I don't trust it. I do better using a regular thermometer in baby's armpit. My step-mother gave me an ear thermometer that can be sanitized instead of using disposable covers and I prefer that one. I think it's by a brand called Especially for Baby.
2,Easy to use but found it not to be accurate,"I read and followed the directions on using this thermometer and even though my son very clearly has a fever, it is still reading normal! The thermometer is easy to use and he tolerates it with no problem. I would do a swipe across his (unmoist) forehead and repeat several separate times and I always would get a different reading and none are accurate so I followed teh directions to use it behind his ear and still nothing. I went back to taking it rectally until I find something reliable. I don't understand! I am obviously in minority here bc it got great reviews from a lot of people... it just doesn't work right for him/us."
4,Works OK,"We use this thermometer for our infant, and it's fairly accurate. We usually have to perform 3-5 readings, and we go by the average. An example of one run would be 97.8, 97.9, 98.2, 97.8. We're really happy with it because it's too difficult to take her temperature accurately without measuring rectally. (Yuck! Who wants to do that?) Should we suspect my toddler has a fever, we will be using it on him as well."
1,Totally INACCURATE,Showed a temp 98.6 as per this thermometer.. Went to the doctor and it was 102. Not reliable. I followed all steps/tips etc etc..This has happened several times. This is out of our lives now!!
1,This item is GARBAGE!,"This is the worst item we have ever bought for our children. It doesn't ever want to take the temperture of the children like its suppose to. In fact 98% of the time it will come up with an error reading and if you are lucky enough to actually get a temperture out of the stinking product...you might what to check it again. Why you ask? Because it always gives a different reading a second time around. Your child's temp could be 100.2 the first time and 104.2 a second later. Always, always, always take the temp. twice because we found out the hard way and my son's severe asthma problems adds to the importance of getting an accurate temp. reading. Normally the higher the temp. the worse his asthma gets that's why he always has to been seen by the doctor right away at the first signs of a cold. I would NEVER buy or recommend this product to anyone....NOT even my worst enemy...lol"
1,No Consistency,"Is this product (supposedly) easy to use?... Yes.Is it a good/cool idea?.... Yes.Is is worth anything?.... No.And here's why: the thermometer is absolutely and completely inconsistent. My wife and I purchased a unit, and then sat down on our couch, after carefully reading the instructions AND all of the anecdotal internet advise, could not get reliable readings from this instrument. At our most careful, we could only get readings at +/- 2 degrees, and most of the time we would receive +/- 5 degrees. We weren't testing the product on squirrely children or complaining infants: we were testing it on ourselves and on eachother. In the end, we returned the product for a refund.My advice is to stay far far away from this product."
1,Doesn't work and gives inaccurate readings.,"Okay, I bought it thinking it's easy to measure, especially for infants. My baby was sick and we measured temperature using this at multiple times during the course of 1-2 days and it never showed above 98-99 degrees (i.e. normal body temperature for babies). The following day baby was really sick and we took her to a hospital nearby and baby had really high fever (over 102). Even on that day this thermometer showed around 98-99. The doctor and nurse there said the readings on these things (scanners) are never accurate. They recommended the in-ear thermometer and ended up getting one from CVS. It's a pain to take readings using those but so far we've found them reliable.Reading other reviews here shows that this deviation can be either way, higher or lower. Skip this one and get one which is accurate (aka with better reviews)."
2,Not accurate,I tried this product numerous times and got different readings EACH time! not sure how accurate this item is if it is giving readings that inconsistent
3,just ok,I had higher hopes for this product. It is a bit cumbersome on a small forehead/temporal area to use and it is not that accurate. I usually do it 3 times and take an average. I also do it on myself to be sure it is measuring correctly. If you can use a good old oral or rectal themometer they are much more accurate.
1,Very frustrating - highly inconsistent results,"I wish there was an easy way to consistently and accurately measure a repeatable body temperature, but the old methods seem best. This one is fantastic to play with, a joy to use and read... until you do it more than once in a row and find you could do better by just guessing. Everyone in our family measures between 96.8 and 97.8 degrees when not ill, but if you take 3 or 4 readings in a row, you'll find at least one 96.<low> outlier in there - so *mine* always reads about a degree low, and has a +/-1 degree swing for any single measurement. I've read all the instructions, cleaned it, replaced batteries, even invented new techniques to try to minimize the inconsistencies but nothing really works. I'm just talking about measuring the temp when not sick, not sweating, just to get a baseline. I can never trust it and usually wind up measuring about 20 times and mentally guessing the average to report to the doc when calling in. Oh well."
5,Awesome,Great product its super easy to use and gives a good reading a must have for nurses or parents so much easier on kids
5,Best way to get an accurate reading!,"We brought this thermometer to the hospital and after the Doctor took his reading, ours was within .1 of theirs. We are very comfortable and would suggest this product in a heartbeat (pun intended)."
2,Multiple readings different results,Following the instructions i attempted to take my baby's temperature. THree swipes yielded a range of results from 97.5 to 101 degrees. the fourth swipe said 98.6 - I took an armpit reading with a conventional thermometer to find out for sure and got 100.6 during all these attempts the baby got increasingly annoyed and thrashed about which resulted in him being bonked in the forehead repeatedly as he struggled against the thing making the readings increasingly innacurate. what a drag!
1,Waste of time and money,"I read numerous rave reviews about this product on numerous sites, and decided to give it a shot. I thought that was extremely accurate, until I realized that I would get variances of 10+ degrees within seconds. My son thought the whole process was really cool, and asked us to take his temperature again. In those six or seven seconds, the unit told us his fever had gone from normal to 105.9. No. Not buying it. The inconsistencies have only gotten worse as I've used the unit, despite hours of rereading the manual and looking up online what I'm doing wrong. At one point, it said my infant daughter's temperature was 103 and I rushed her to the doctor to find that her temperature (without medication) was really only 100.Don't waste your money on this one, but if you find one that's better than this ... please let me know!"
1,Never worked,"Awful product!!!! Never worked. I took this product to my peditrician and she said, ""she does not want us to utilize temporal thermometers on our little ones. They are never accurate."""
1,Doesn't work!!!!,"I was looking for a temporal artery thermometer for my six-month old son so I wouldn't need to rely on his underarm thermometer, but this one is useless. I took him temperature the first time: 76.8. The second time: 97.8. The third time: 88.9. The fourth time: 99.3. I took my temperature: 85.4. I took it again: 95.7. I took my husband's temperature: 94.3. We read the directions many times and tried it over and over. There was never a consistent temperature. Either we are all aliens with wildly irregular and fluctuating temperatures, or I completely wasted my money. I am throwing it away and now I need a new one. Don't buy this."
5,"Never looked back, this thing is great","We bought this thing after months of struggling with getting readings from the traditional style thermometers. Have you read the instructions on those? ""Hold under arm/under tongue/in the dark place"" for 1 minute. Yeah, good luck keeping your sick child still for one minute and getting an accurate reading. This thing is a breeze to use and you have a reading before your child even knows what you're doing. We got turned on to this technology after seeing our pediatrician use it in her office and it will be our default gift for all future baby showers my wife goes to."
5,Awesome product... once you take the cap off :),"I first got this and it was reading really really off, like 50F. I then realised that the protector cap was still on. haha. took it off and it works great. Almost always even with the rectal temp. Awesome for night time temp checks when your baby is sleeping. My only issue is the beeping but it's suppose to, it lets you know when the temp is scanned.Awesome invention! No mom should be without this."
4,Fast and accurate,Works well. Fast and (as far as I can tell) accurate. Rated one star down due to cost but I guess you get what you pay for!
4,"Takes some practice, but great after that",This thermometer takes the guess work and the wrestling out of taking a toddlers temperature! It is well worth the time to visit the exergen website and watch the tutorial on how to take a temperature. Once you have that mastered then the results are are accurate!
3,Not as good as expected,"Working fine on adults, although you have to take several measurements (3-4) in order to make sure what the real temperature is, since there are false results once in a while. Anyway, taking a measurement takes only 3 seconds, so it takes around 10 seconds to measure the temperature. ""Good"" measurements might differ up to 0.2 Celsius degrees between each other, which is good enough.The problem with that device is that it doesn't work on babies - at least not on my 3 month baby. She was sick, and we tried it many times, but got results between 37 - 40 Celsius degrees..."
2,Just doesnt work for us!,"I must be really thick but for the life of me I cant get this to work.. I scanned through all the reviews, made sure I removed the plastic thingie but it still registers radically different temperatures every time!One time he had a fever and it wasnt even close.. maybe next time I will take it to the pediatricians office and ask her to check it... if she can use it I probably need a tutorial :p"
4,Thermometer,"This product is great, just is frustrating when it doesn't give an accurate reading when not pressed against the forehead just right...."
1,Without accuracy,"The thermometer does not offer any accuracy, for that reason is unreliable. I thought it would be a good choice for measuring temperature in children with fever quickly, but I was wrong."
2,i don't get reasonable results,"We read the directions and practiced, but we are still getting weird results on our (wiggly) kid. Because we don't trust the results with this thermometer, we have to subject the kid to the other thermometer too... (it was a waste of money for us)."
2,"started off well, didn't last long","read good reviews before purchased this - but had to soon buy another due to it not having a back light so you can read temperature at night. it doesn't sound an issue, but 70 percent of the time i use it at night! it gradually got less and less reliable - the button kept sticking down so i couldn't release it .... overall it worked well in the light the first 6 months."
1,Not easy to use - returned for Braun inner ear,"It may be a great product, but it is hard to tell which one of the 10 different readings we got was accurate, and we shuddered to think about how a baby sitter, grand parent or other parent would apply and analyze it.This scaled down consumer available technology just isn't idiot proof, though with full disclosure my wife and I both have doctorate degrees (my wife is a veterinarian) and we couldn't get one of these units to consistently get the same temperature on any subject.We returned ours to repurchase a replacement of a Braun inner ear unit... we'd typically dry, remove hair and check both ears to get a pretty narrow possible range."
4,Works well,My sister has this. Works well on her 3 year old daughter. I just wish it was a little easier to figure out how to use.
3,Inconsistent thermometer,"Took a while to get the hang of using it. After a month of taking AM temp, I still get readings all over the map. I get different readings depending on which direction I take the T across my forehead. And different readings behind each ear. Might as well just make it up as I go."
5,Excellent Thermometer,"The Thermometer was easy to use, affordable, fast and accurate. Great for children's temperature as it is non invasive and almost fun to use. A quick swipe of the temporal region yields an easy to read temperature. Similar devices are in use in many Hospitals. Amazon provided an excellent 5 star product as well as delivery service."
5,thermometer,My children love the ease of using this. The first one fell on the hard floor and broke and I knew we would just have to buy another!
3,Orchids of Florida,"The book is well done and put together. The only issues I noted are that the author does not give photogrpahic credit to several contributors. Least of which is Carlyle Luer. The author has used several copied photos right from Dr. Luers ""Native Orchids of Florida"" without permission or proper credit.Some of the taxonomic changes and listing are not as accurate as they could be, but the overall work is complete and covers all known species to occur in Florida. One helpful note, future books should follow the Luer style for various stories and all photos should have dates taken and county listings."
3,"Soild music, a little monotonous","Don't get me wrong, these guys are great musicians and their music is tight and solid, and somewhat original. I do listen to the album periodically, however, as an overall album I find that the collection can get a bit fatiguing. The band needs to mix up tempo, key and and sound density a little bit, IMO. ""Drone"" is an adjective that comes to mind although some people don't mind that. I prefer to put selected songs on mix CDs where they can really punch up the mix."
5,TSUNAMI BOMB ROCKS!!...,I BOUGHT THIS CD THE DAY IT CAME OUT AND I LOVE EACH AND EVERY SINGLE SONG!!...I ALSO HAVE THE INVASION FROM WITHIN CD AND IT ROCKS TOO!!...I LOVE EVERY SINGLE SONG THAT IS ON THAT CD AS WELL. T.B IS THE BEST I SUGGEST PEOPLE THAT LIKE PUNK TO BUY IT.THEY ARE SO KOOL!!...
3,much ado about nothing,"with all the hype surrounding these people, you'd think this would be something different or unique amongst a crowded field of pop-punk wannabes. well, you would be wrong. this is generic Epi-Fat style pop-punk music with fairly unimpressive and mousey female vocals. i really shoulda known better since it was on Kung-Fu Records (Vandals) but i wanted to believe that this might be a worthwhile pop-punk effort. i was disappointed. the first track is decent, but the rest is horribly mediocre stuff that's been done a thousand times before, and at least 500 times better. if you're looking for a decent female-fronted pop-punk band, get some Tilt cd's. this is here-today-gone-tomorrow stuff."
4,G gets political....for a little bit.,"Gerald is back for his yearly dose of great R&B music. But he has made a little bit of a change in his delivery. He dedicates the begining 6 or so tracks to his views on the direction the world is heading, and asking us if we feel the same. He dosen't go into great detail of what he thinks should be done to change what is wrong, but putting his feelings out there is a strong enough statement in its self,(he's not running for president). But before long, G-Baby gets back to what he does best, baby makin music. The way he tells a story in a song is unrivaled, and he has some of his better songs he has put out in a couple years,(the man drops an album a year). I'm not going to hate on him making a few political and somewhat spiritual songs, but when he sings about love, he is at his best. Still, in the end, it is not a bad change of pace. Much love to ya G."
2,not what you would expect,"this album is not a classic levert cd. the cd is really about the album title. if you are looking for alot of slow songs, this is not the cd. if you want something political, then here you go. i'm disappointed myself."
1,No You May Not Speak For the World...,Ok exactly why did G waste his time on this album.It literally falls short of what he did for Stroke of Genius and G Spot.I hate to compare but he tries too hard at making a Marvin Gaye album[What's Going On].I suggest next time he tries at doing himself instead of something he isn't because it ain't working
1,Cheap Speakers = Cheap Sound,Should have spent another $30 on a name brand. Would have saved myself $20 and all the time installing this garbage. Now I have to do it all over again.
5,Awesome Speakers,I must say at the time I had a 95' Nissan Maxima whose speakers have gone out and I wanted something cheap to replace em and these right here are CHEAP AND FANTASTIC!! The sound quality is awesome and overall great. They did my Maxima justice!
4,Great sound for the price,"After many years of great sound, my Infinity speakers fell apart in my Integra. With a limited budget, I looked at many different 6.5"" speakers and bought this after hearing some Dual speakers at a nearby store. I am pleased. The construction is solid, and the mounting depth is fairly shallow, making the installation easy. These speakers are a bit bigger than many 6.5"" speakers, but that is the only drawback. The sound is much better than I expected. The midrange is a bit heavy, but the tweeter is smooth without being screechy. The bottom end is not boomy. I plan on buying another pair for my wife's car!"
4,I Wish I Had Been Involved in the Editing....,"12th & McGraw is one of those books that grabs you and won't let go! Because I know the author and his wife as wonderful acquaintances (and we would be good friends if we could spend more time together) I know the life he lived as a youngster still impacts him today. I can not imagine living through the adventures he describes, but they are certainly fun to read about. My ONLY criticism of the book is that it could use some additional editing. Having been a journalist all my life, I read everything entirely too critically. This book is not the only one I'd like to get my hands on. When Forrest talks of his lovely and wonderful wife ""Nancy,"" he doesn't exaggerate at all. She's a living doll and, together, they have made a wonderful life for themselves and their family. I know that to be true. This book is exciting and Forrest has the ability to put his reader right in the middle of all the action. Give it a try. You won't be sorry."
5,Light weight air hose,This is an excellent hose. Very light weight it is almost as if nothing is attached to the nail gun. I just replaced some 20 year old hoses that had begun to leak air. I would have replaced them sooner if I had known this was available. I do finish carpentry and this clean enough that it will not mar completed work or other rooms that it is running through.
3,Best Hose you can Buy. Price high though,Yes these polyurethane hoses are the most popular hoses in use by framing and roofing contractors. They are nice. Yet I bought this from Amazon feeling safe that Amazon works hard to keep their prices the lowest around. So I was quite disappointed when I found the same hose minus Bostitch's name for half the price at a local store. Which I believe I am not allowed to name the store because Amazon blocked this review the first time I wrote it. I will give you a hint though initials HF.
4,Good!,"Have had no problems yet, minor useage, but will put through more in coming months. So far, so good. Thanks!"
5,More than Football My Son Loves It!!,"[[ASIN:B000P0TCDQ NCAA Football 08]I bought this for my 11 year old son for Christmas. I also bought Madden 08. He loves sports games but he has fun on this game because it lets him pick classes and take exams. It's a lot more than just sports, it has many college activities to do. A video game that lets them use their brain."
1,Best Album E ver,"Your previous work was quite good. Your voice was an amazing tool, accompained by strong guitar playing. Your music would help me and my wife make sweet love under a full moon. But now I am barely able to get a hard on. Your vocals have shriveled my balls into fruitless prunes. My wife is very dissappointed, not in me, but in you John. Youe voice was like a howling bachelor, crying for sweet, sweaty love. But now is frail weak, just like my balls. I am strongly against the use of Viagra, Cialis, and Levitra. Instead I preffered your sensual vocals to accompainy my wife's howls. What happened John? But now I am forced to resort to porn. Porn is meaningless, it lacks the pure lyrical majesty that is song."
5,"Now, this is what I've been waiting for!!","All through my pregnancy, I looked for the perfect baby book and this one is definitely it! Others that I have seen pale in comparison. This memory scrapbook is one I can keep for seven years to document birthdays, holidays and other milestones. It's beautiful to behold. It is looseleaf-bound which is convenient for adding scrapbook pages easily! The colors and quality are stunning. I cannot wait to fill it up for our baby from infancy through first grade! It's beautiful inside and out and suitable for both baby girl or boy. Being a scrapbook hobbyist, this is excellent paper. Great shower, Christening, Jewish brith milah or bris gift as it will last forever."
5,The Young Visiters HUGH LAURIE!,"The young visiters is based on a book by a nine year old victorian girl. I have not read the book so I cannot say if the movie lived up to it or not, but I loved this little movie. I bought it because it stars Hugh Laurie, my favorite fellow of the day, and he is wonderful in it. The other actors are fine too, terrifically peculiar... especially the wealthy alcoholic friend of the Prince. This is not a movie with a giant storyline but more of a collection of weird and wonderful characters and strange scenes. It really gives the feeling of being seen thru the eyes of a child."
4,do me a favor. Just try this movie once.,"it doesn't have sex or violence or car chases, or even sexy love scenes, but it is hilarious. See my review of the book for more details, but, if you are a fan of the unexpectedly hilarious, this is the movie to see."
2,Tries too hard to be a comedy without success,"I was disappointed in this movie. I enjoy British comedy for the most part and love a period movie. This tried to be a comedy but was just sophomoric, borderline slapstick comedy. Couldn't get through. Too bad - cast was full of greats. A waste of time"
3,Cute,I continually had to remind myself that a 9 year old girl wrote this in order to watch it through to the end. That was the only thing that kept me watching it.
5,Great information and advice!,"This is a wonderfully optimistic and inspirational book to read. In my opinion, this is the best book that Dan Millman has written to date. It outlines the virtues of common sense living, how to learn the important lessons from our (and from others') mistakes, and much more.I highly recommend it to everyone who wants to make a difference!"
5,Good Intro to Navajo culture for 5-8th Graders,"This book has realistic characters, a good mystery, and does a really excellent job of introducing 5th to 9th graders to Navajo culture in a non-boring and non-lecturing way. My daughter and I read the book together in the evenings, and it was so interesting to her that she was finding excuses to head up a bit early. I really hope the authors consider writing another book for children this age."
3,Spirit Line,"Well of course it's not Tonny Hillerman. However, the characters are interesting and it's a very pleasant yarn and a nice way to absorb a little Navaho culture.To my very limited knowledge, the authors seem to have made a real effort to accurately describe traditional Navaho beliefs and some of the real conflicts with modern life."
2,Review for the Spirit Line- by a kid,"This book was not very good, I personally thought. I wouldn't waste my time reading it. I had to read it for my school's Battle of the Books. While my peers enjoyed it, I hated it. The book was soo draggy and kept on repeating itself. It sounded so much like how the elementary school teachers taught you how to write. Not a very good plot either, besides the part when Crystal's (the main character) rug got stolen, but I think we all got the point when they kept on the repeating that part for like half of the book (it's true!). Not something worth spending your money on. Not much of a mystery either."
4,Quick tips,"An interesting book with basic and not-so-basic information. I find it useful about half the time when I flip through it for specific information. To be fair, it is a good referance book and I have learned a few things by reading it. This book would be a fantastic gift for a novice cook."
2,Bathroom Book,"Interesting facts for various foods, but it seems more like trivia than information you would retain as a cook."
1,Way overpriced,"If you got a crappy brand TV like the Samsung the East Meadow guy got, you might need a super-expensive cable like this to make the image quality acceptable, but if you have a namebrand TV like Sony or Sharp or Philips or Toshiba or Panasonic, a $15 HDMI-DVI cable totally suffices. This Monster cable is no better than the $15 guy (also available on Amazon, just search for ""hdmi dvi cable""). Don't waste your money."
1,Pay alittle more for a real Digital Camera,"I am very disappointed with this camera, from the quality of its pictures to the quality of the camera itself. Save your money and add another 75-100 dollars and buy a real digital camera. I have a Sony Digital camera that I used to borrow from work with less resolution that takes better quality pictures. At one time I lost all my pictures on my card because I slightly (and I mean slightly) bumped the camera, and these pictures were from my European trip that I cannot get back."
4,Good camera for beginners,"This is a nice camera for amateur photographers like myself. The picture quality is good, although not as sharp as more expensive cameras. My biggest complaint is that the pictures seem a little washed out; they don't have the vibrant color of more expensive cameras. I've used this camera for a few years now, and it's been very reliable. The battery life is decent, but I recommend using rechargeable batteries to save money in the long run.Bottom line: This is a nice entry-level camera that should meet the needs of most amateur photographers."
3,You can do better,"Visioneer has made digital cameras affordable, but you can do better with a little bit more money. I took over 2,000 pics with my camera in the course of one year before it gave out. Now I have to go out and buy another camera. I called Visioneer and they do not do repairs. Visioneer is a basic and descent intro level camera...but you get what you pay for. For another $75 you can go out and get a good Sony or Olympus with better service. But if you don't want to spend the money you get what you pay for with Visioneer"
1,Don't waste your money,"This has to be the worst price guide I have ever seen. Forget about the values not even being close, the Ertl listing has so many errors its pathetic. Several of the cars listed are 1/43, Not 1/18, and are listed as 1/18, colors listed that were never made it goes on and on.Sorry but it just don't cut it."
3,garvintx,"Very incomplete. Lots of hot rods and muscle cars, few classic cars. Many manufacturers missing. Disappointing. Not all models listed are 1/18 scale."
1,Don't waste your money,"If you are looking for accuracy this is not the book. The Ertl section has several 1/43 cars listed as 1/18 and many cars that Ertl canceled or changed colors on. Price guides are just that Guides, but this one does not stay uniform on the values, some are actual dealer cost and some way over inflated while most are original retail."
5,Looking for a fabulous book? This is it!,I loved this book! I'm a big football fan and Bobby McIntyre is my kind of hero. He's smart and tough yet tender when he needs to be. And Lacey Wright knows just how to handle him. They take their time and get to know each other as they fall in love.Great pool scene near the end!
3,"Kinda Cute,But done before..","Hey Y'all,This is not a bad story,in fact I did read it in one sitting.I kept thinking I had read it before and than it hit me that it was very similar to Heaven,Texas by S.E. Phillips,a book I really love.If I didn't have Bobby Tom as a reference I probably would of enjoyed it more,as it was I thought the story was alittle unbelievable but O.K.,its fiction so thats allright, I give this book 3 stars mainly because there were 2 scenes that were similar to the Heaven ,Texas book.For the positive,The daughter was a well thought out character and she did girls everywhere proud."
2,Disappointing but with original plot....,"I read this author's ""The Ex-Debutante"" and enjoyed it very much so I thought that her back list books would be equally good. This one was a disappointment because of the clunky writing (VERY odd use of verbs), awkward sex scenes and repetitious thoughts by hero and heroine. On the other hand, the plot mechanism of the pregnant teen in two generations was interesting and rather unusual (perhaps because it is no longer considered such a shame??). I liked the secondary romance of the heroine's daughter better than the mother's...and the boyfriend was more sympathetic than the hero. After all, don't football players deal with injuries all the time???There are better books out there about football players. For laughs plus romance, try the Susan Elizabeth Phillips series about the Chicago Stars. Those are well-written, witty and have very good character development."
3,Life 101,"Though Predictable, You Still Find Yourself Caught Up In This Awkward Look At Life Of A College Freshman In The 1960's...Ramsey Blake (Corey Haim) Meets Joy (Ami Dolenz) At His First Co-Ed Beer Bash And, After Some Peer Pressure, He Gathers The Courage To Ask Her Out On A Date...Ramsey Now Is Confronted With Questions Of Love, Trust, And Self Discovery...There Is Nothing New To Life Lessons Here, But Both Haim And Dolenz Charm Their Way Through This ""Joyful"" Romantic Comedy..."
2,cover wont stay hooked,i like the cover but the center part of the cover next to the cab will not stay hooked. this part of the cover does not have snaps. i sent lund a email but heard nothing from lund. i do not recommend this cover
1,"JUST AN AWFUL WORKOUT, AND DANGEROUS TO BOOT","Thankfully I reviewed the videotape before doing the workout, (which I should have done before buying it), and saved myself megaa bucks in the Chiropractor's office. The movements are over repeated, stressful on the joints, and with a hundred people working out with her, there is no moving around possible at all, which also causes stress on the joints and back.Now I know why I hated Jazzercise years ago, and I haven't changed my mind. For those that like to dance aerobic, there are many excellent workouts available, but this isn't one of them."
5,This is a Great Canteen/Air Pillow!!!,"This really is a good purchase, and I was very pleased when I recieved it in the mail. The price was good, and the product was worth a lot more then I paided. I will be purchasing more for future use. This can be canteen or a air pillow. The materials are really good, and the sewing is great. If you are thinking about buying one, you will not be disappointed. I would STRONGLY recommend this for anyone who is building a really good Survival Kit. This is a 5 quart canteen that can fold up into a ball that fits in the palm of your hand."
3,Depressing slice of the gay life twenty years ago.,"This daring film (for its day) takes us on a tour of a lonely life - a gay teacher in 1978 London trying to find a lover. It is touted as the first gay-themed narrative film with a ""positive"" outlook - in that no one is ashamed of being gay and no one dies in the end for being so. I will grant it that, but the life (however accurate) of a seeker of love and relationship in a world only interested in casual sex is, in the end, a negative look at a negative world. How far we've come. The film is cast with competent, though almost universally plain, actors. Some scenes go on far too long. And it's drab and drear both in locations and in lousy color saturation. This is a hard one to sit through. Its importance is totally historical - to see where we were and be glad we've come a great deal farther towards our goals."
4,whoah,"This band basically plays covers of anime theme songs. They seem like they are metallica wannabees (one of their cds had a metallica-like logo, and they looked like metallica) and their music basically sounds like them. I like the hard guitar though"
4,Excellent and concise,"This book helps cut through the ""spookie"" maze that is sometimes put up by some who overspiritualize EVERYTHING. Many times, I see how one can get ""stuck"" by obsessing about seeking and being in God's perfect will for one's life, and other times making important decisions by connecting dots that don't really connect. I think this book offers some guidance on balancing your thinking in order to stay focused and make decisions based on a firm, biblical foundation."
5,Great supplement to boost my immune system.,"Great supplement to boost my immune system. I take it when I feel like I am about to come down with something, sinus problems, colds, infections, etc."
5,My whole family takes this stuff---even the dog,Years ago my sister suggested I try this problem to avoid getting sick or to shorten the duration of a cold or flu.So now here whole extended family uses this product as does mine. I recently also discovered this is of great help with UTIs in both people and animals. I spent $250 at the VET and came home with her still sick and not knowing what to do. A little research and I discovered other pet owners treat UTIs in their dogs with this product and D-Mannose. I don't use one of these whole capsules for my dog. Just a few drops in an empty capsule a day works wonders.
1,Contains Beef Gelatin,"Warning to vegetarians or anyone who likes to know all the ingredients. Package states: ""Capsules made from 100% beef gelatin"" I didn't see this when ordering and am therefore disappointed. (my own fault) I will order another brand without a gelatin capsule. Sorry for the misleading rating but I wanted to let you all know."
1,Don't like it much,"This is an unusual product, I don't understand why it works. It is supposed to be an antiviral? A herbal supplement? I just don't know how to properly use it as directed and when the product arrived it had a sticker covering the directions, which made it worse."
4,Amazon header is mislabeled,"Like the product, but was disappointed to learn after receiving the item that Amazon has the header mislabeled...it says ""Super Strength"", but when I received the item, the packing list said ""This is not the Super Strength - the header with Amazon is incorrect - This is regular strength - see picture."""
2,Heart skipped beats,"I think this company makes great products, however i was not able to take these as they made my heart get skipped beats. I stopped taking them and i am fine. The oregano oil does not do this, so it must be somthing in this mixture that caused this."
1,Will not hold 3 trumpets,"It is cheap and not very protective. The BS about ball bearings and strong foam padding is a lot of hand waving by the manufacturer. I put mutes in the center compartment and two trumpets on the outside. They both ended up with BIG dents in the bells, presumably from the sharp edge of the mute. OUCH. If you buy it consider that your are carrying your precious horns around in a sock."
2,READER BEWARE,"McWhorter warns his readers that this is not a work of scholarship, which he can get away with in some chapters, but not the one about afrocentric history. To substantiate their claims, afrocentric advocates generated scores of conferences, tours, study groups, and publications over the last two decades. Yet, McWhorter dismisses all of that by directing his readers to a flawed work by another opponent of afrocentrism. McWhorter should stick to linguistics. I say,"" Let the reader beware."""
1,more redundancy,"Black conseratives like McWhorter need to stop churning out books like this collection of essays. AB feels like a tenure book, there's just nothing in the darn thing, it's repetitive and repeats what has been said before a hundred ways 10 years ago. The Republican Party has moved on and ambitious freshly minted conservative black PhDs need to move on too. Read in the bookstore in you're curious but don't waste your money."
2,No sure if I agree with McWorther,"After veiwing a recent segment of C-Span's Booknotes which featured Mr.McWorther and his recent book ""Authentically Black"", I can't understand this book's main purpose. I'm in agreement with at least 30% of material and facts listed in the book, but the author's way off base on main issues. This book's great if you want to impress your assimilating friends or right wing wannabes.Also in the C-Span interview I noticed Mr.McWorther's negative comments about his parents showed the lack self esteem which happens to be reflected in his writings. On a lighter note, I see a future Ralph Waldo Emerson, Skip Gates, even a Bayard Rustin (which I'm a huge fan). What is it with the California emulation movement,with members such as Wade Connerly, Larry Elder, Jesse Lee Peterson. I'm currectly reading a copy of "" The American Directory of Certified Uncle Toms"" and John H. McWorther wasn't listed and I wonder why."
3,This one makes you think,"The author has some strong arguments why there is a black silent majority in America. I have to agree with a substantial amount of them. He supports his idea pretty well. I wish it would have drawn me in a little better. The only book that has done that lately is the biography of a dead rock star from Alice In Chains called ""Angry Chair."" But I guess I can recommend both of them if you want to see things in this world just a little differently."
2,Is it about the black community... or John McWhorter?,"McWhorter continuously gravitates toward the same point over and over... and over again. Mix this with his other appearances, and he comes across as a black man who seems less concerned with the ills of the black community, but rather a black man who feels that HE cannot be fully appreciated/accepted.I found myself frustrated with this book... not due to the subject matter, or the position, (I agree with this repetative point(s)), but rather because I wanted him to get the point.Cake tastes great!Cake has some nutritional values!Cake is enjoyed by many cultures the world over!So what are you saying John? You want some cake?John... writing with passion isn't a bad thing. The book lacks ""flavor"", and because of this, you come across as missing THE point."
2,Questionable Motive,"Initially, the book was published in the US in 1917, and the author's suspiciously Happy Eagle Scout rendition of life in the French Army in the trenches makes one wonder how much the motive was to inspire cheery if uninformed American participation in the war. It is, or could be, a useful insight into its environment, but one wonders about the author's shading?"
3,"There is no ""firewire "" with this one","Without purchasing another piece of hardware ,you cannot record to dvd via PC with this little number.All the other features are great but it's like traveling 500 ft and stopping short 1 foot from the destination .WTF!!!!Amazon advertises the Monster cable as an ""accessory"". Really?I have no idea why ,after spending the 39.99 for it and opening it like Ralphie from a Christmas story it may as well have been a bunny pajama suit.In hindsight I would have purchased the 780 not the 730,but it wasn't disclosed ."
5,Fun Filled Phenomenon,"From even the front cover, you can tell this is a hilarious book. The short newspaper articles and art projects make the book an easy read. The authors have certainly outdone themselves with their creativity and use of pop culture. There's an entire yearbook that features Peeps in a high school environment-- participating in sports, get voted for Homecoming's Royal Court, and much more. Another one of my favorite parts is the Peeple weekly magazine. This book is a fun read, but also has the capability of pulling in some reluctant readers. Check it out, and maybe it will be in someone's Easter basket soon!"
2,Charged for two -- only received one,Somehow you charged me for two of these -- 20+ dollars -- only ordered one and only received one.
4,Does the trick!,My prior one was deteriorating and a bit broken. This was very easy to install and worked flawlessly. Note that there are NO instructions- that's ok I guess. The side clips that cover the skrew holes are strangely designed. You can only get to them from an unistalled unit to take them off. The snap into place and I'm guessing there is NO way to remove them without breaking them- unless of course you had the unit off the boat which is impossible if you haven't had access to the screws!
5,A year later and it is still sweet.,"It took me some time to install this into my boat. I call it my upholstery apprenticeship. I know why custom upholstery costs so much now. It looks sweet now and sounds even better. This deck sounds so clear, even at excessively high volumes (OH MY!) I hooked them up to the Infinity Reference 6.5, 225 watt. It pushes them just fine. Matching ohms perfect. The Dual SG1 Universal splash cover fit and works great."
3,Not quite universal,"I have a 2001 Crestliner that came with a splash cover on the radio. It was time to update the radio so I thought a new splash cover sounded like a good idea, too. Unfortunately, this thing is too wide. The Crestliner has a curved molded dash with a flat opening to mount the radio. The outside dimensions of the flat part of the dash opening are smaller than the outside dimensions of this splash guard so no matter what you do, this will not fit. Too bad because it's a smooth working unit. If your dash is flat, this should work fine for you."
3,Nice unit TRICKY to install,"I bought this to go with my new stereo for my boat. It is a nice unit and looks good. The part that can be hard to deal with is how hard it is to install properly. I am a mechanic, so with that said, it took me over 2 hours to get this installed and working properly. I have a flat dash area where it was installed. Flat is a must for it to work. You have to cut a rather large hole for the unit to fit as well due to the cover goes over the top of your radio. If you tighten one screw just a little too much, it will not open properly or close all the way. Nice unit but buyer be aware of the install process. If you dont have the patience for this dont buy it."
4,Mac to Windows switch may be a problem,"I think this is a good jumpdrive, though the swivel action seems a little flimsy as others have pointed out. My main problem with it, which may not apply to many other people, is that you can't encrypt files on a Mac and then open them in Windows."
5,"Simple and functional, excellent design","I've been looking for an ideal usb drive for quite some time, which means it should not have a cover that can fall off and with a good read/write speed.Have used the Cruzer Titanium series in the past, these are marketed as 'indestructible' however, the loop used to attach it to the keyring is very fragile.This drive is fast, has an all-in-one design (the casing itself fits onto your keyring) and looks great as well.If you're looking for a simple and functional USB flash drive, this will serve your purpose.--- Update Jan 2010 ---The Lexar JumpDrive Swivel series has been discontinued, I now recommend the newerLexar JumpDrive TwistTurnseries"
4,Well-Built & Fast,"I've been using the 2GB model to synchronise all of my working files between a home laptop system and a desktop at university (I'm a PhD student). I also use it as a keychain as well so it's always in my pocket or bumping up against all of the junk I carry back and forth on a daily basis as well as around town.After a month of frequent use, the drive still seems solidly built, though the plastic of the USB casing is the least solid element (the metal 'wrapper' appears pretty much indestructible). Transfers are lightning fast over USB2 and I can sync well over 500MB of data in less than 30 seconds. Good enough for me.I have *not* used the software provided on the disk since it doesn't work on a Mac, but the one time I attached it to a PC Windows offered to start up the included application that (as I understand it) allows you to generate a portable profile for use on any PC."
5,Fine Product,"While this isn't quite as fast as the Sandisk that I have, I found it perfectly functional."
2,Poor quality.,"I have come to expect quite a bit more in terms of quality from Lexar. The concept is very cool, no cap to lose and the metal is highly resilient, the motion was good, etc... However, within 6 months of day to day use the connector failed and I was unable to transfer data without holding the unit in a very precarious position. Luckily i was able to get all my important data off before it finally gave up the ghost.I have since purchased a new drive, which will hopefully hold up better. Be forewarned this item works out of the box and is solid, but based on my experience I wouldn't trust it with anything important, because mine failed in less than 6 months of moderate use."
2,"If you are a PRO, don't buy this book.","I can't believe I purchased a book that is simply a compilation of logos that vary from good to terrible. This time David E. Carter had very little to say and the book is only acceptable if you are a beginner in the graphic design industry. If you are a Professional, don't even think of buying it, you're gonna waste your money just like I did."
5,An animal lover's delight!,"Puppy in the Pulpit is a pet lover's delight to read and light enough to induce even reluctant readers to enjoy the stories of dog and man (make that dog and woman!)that it includes. The author is an obvious dog-lover, and uses her experiences with her pet to bring out sometime light and sometime deeper analogies between us and our heavenly Father. She describes doggie behaviour quite adeptly and almost makes me want to get another dog myself. (We have two cats, or I'd consider it.) From cute to serious, her stories will give you a chuckle and a pause or two, encouraging you to reflect on the beauty and wonder of the gift of life. When you close the pages you'll feel as if you know her and ""Dixie Lee"" the dog like old neighbors."
3,A decent introduction to Native American poetry...,"...but I have to ask how 50 pages can possibly be considered to constitute an anthology.I'll admit it was the poetry (which is mostly if not completely modern) rather than the traditional songs which attracted my attention. In particular, I quite liked ""This Is No Movie of Noble Savages"" by Adrian Louis and the poems by Sherman Alexie. One thing in particular that annoyed me with this book, however, was what would seem to be an anachronism perpetuated by the translator(s). Namely, several traditional Native American songs in the book from different tribes refer to 'the Milky Way'. Now, I don't know what the words are that these were translated from, but I'm fairly sure that there weren't any Native Americans (or anybody else at th time) that were calling anything a Milky Way."
2,Nothing new under the sky,"This book presents a mixture of information and factoids that most people should already know from all the information commonly available today. Most of it stems from common sense and the rest you should have gotten from your physician.I did not get much out of this book.If you expect to find some revolutionary therapy in this book, save your money.Nonetheless, since this book is currently available at very low prices, it may be worth having just because it is written in a clear and entertaining style and maybe useful as a supplementary source of information.If you have serious physical concerns, this book IS NO substitute for a visit to a good specialist.This book is definitely NOT a ""Body Repair Kit"""
5,"Incredible Book, soulful, romantic, conscientious, wonderful","I picked up this book at a book fair in Cleveland, OH and was delightfully surprized! I am not normally a poetry lover, but the author was REALLY handsome, so I figured, what the heck? I will give the book a glance and get to talk to Razzaq (the Author). I am so glad I picked up this book. Razzaq's poems are amazing! They range from romantic (my prayer), to political (my blackness), to humorus (legend among the fly), to inspiring (eye of the storm), just to name a few. All of his poems are excellent and this is coming from someone who is very interested in literature, but was not really ""jazzed"" by poetry. I now am ""jazzed""! Razzaq, and ""Impressions of a Young Black Man"" are worth your time and money!! I would recommend this book to anyone! In fact, I am buying it as a Christmas gift for both friends and family!"
5,"VERY, VERY CUTE!","OKAY I HAVE 2 OF THESE SETS AND THEY ARE VERY, VERY CUTE! WHAT I REALLY LIKE IS THAT THERE IS A MAGNET IN THE PLATFORM THAT IS INSIDE OF THE EXERCISE WHEEL THAT THE HAMSTER WILL ACTUALLY STICK TO! WHY THEY DON'T PUT MAGNETS INTO MORE OF THE LITTLEST PET SHOP PLAYSETS I JUST DON'T KNOW. THEY PUT A LITTLE MAGNET INSIDE OF EVERY LITTLE PET! SO WHY NOT INCLUDE THEM IN THE PLAYSETS AS WELL? I JUST CAN'T FIGURE THAT OUT. OH WELL! THIS SET HAS ONE AND IT IS VERY CUTE. YOU CAN MAKE YOUR HAMSTER USE THE EXERCISE WHEEL AND HE STICKS TO THE PLATFORM. COOL!"
3,You get what you pay for.,"This worked well at first, but they obviously cut some corners in the manufacturing process. After two days the earpice got jarred a little when I put it down on the table and it split open. I was able to put it back together with some tape, and it still worked, but the sound quality was affected and I was always worried about it spliting open again.Still, for the price, you can't beat it--just be sure to handle with lots of care."
5,I only hope my son enjoys this book as much as I do...,"Perhaps when he is able to talk my son will let me know whether or not he likes this book, but until then I will keep reading it to him. This story/poem is seamless. And the artwork is amazingly detailed - each time I read it, I discover some new hidden image. The art has a motion (and emotion) that bring the bear, his child and his four little friends to life. I get choked-up almost every time I reach the end.Now, to search for more works by this team..."
5,Oh Joy Oh Joy this book has brought me!,"As a mother of three children, (two of which are grown adults) and one entering the teenage years and the grandmother of the most beautiful baby ever born I thought this book said every thing that I have ever felt about my children and grandchild but I could have never said it so beautifully. As I read the book in the gift shop of the local Children's Hospital tears of joy and connection sprang from my eyes. I bought the book for my son to read to his newborn daughter with a personal note to him reminding him this book expresses his father and my feelings about him."
5,Love this book,I love this book. It describes everything that your little one can bring out in you. This book has a different meaning for me as it was a book that my husband and I read to our one month old daughter while she was in the ICU suffering from a rare illness. We read it all the time to her and could never make it through with out crying like a baby. She passed away six days later and this book was out favorite because it is all the things we wish she would have had the time to be for us.
5,I adore this book.,"The title says it all. I feel like this book is just so beautiful. I truly love the concept and the lyricism of the words. One of my favorite books. I also love the Christmas version, ""You are my miracle."" I gave it to my sister, and she says it makes her cry every time she reads it to her kids. :)"
5,Must have!,"I bought this book for my daughter who has a young child. What a beautiful book it is on parent/child love. If you open it, look at the pictures, read the words, you too will buy it!"
1,Somnolentic stuff,"I tried to read this to my brother's son, but both of us soon became bored and fell asleep. I guess that's the point."
5,Perfect gift for Daddy from his little girl!,"Before my husband left for Iraq, I was thinking of a little something our one-year-old could get him. I found this book, and inked her handprint inside the cover. This book described all the things they do together, all the things he'd miss while away. It was more than perfect!"
5,Loved this book,"This book is the sweetest book I have ever read to my little girl. I too cried the first time I read it and I think that the reviewer from Publishers Weekly is either not a parent or not a person with much true emotion. This book is beautiful and my daughter now says to me ""You are my saying grace"" how sweet is that?"
5,My new favorite book,"My daughter is a toddler and loves bing read to. Her favorites are Rockin' Baby, Chicka Chicka Boom, Boom and 5 Silly Monkeys. Well, last night she was getting all of her books out and giving them to me to read to her. Usually, I have to read super fast before the next book. When she handed me ""You are my I love you"". I was immediately struck by the beauty of the passages and could recognize every one of them. My favorite, ""I am your dandelion, you are my first wish"". I immediately told my wife, ""I think this is my new favorite book. Who gave this to us?"" It truly captures the joy and beauty of parenthood and that special relationship between parent and child. I love this poem. I love the illustrations. I love this book. And I love my daughter!"
5,Remember what a gift it is to have a child,"Listen to a parent rather than a book critic talk about this book: After a long day of chasing my toddler, I settle her down for bed with this story. It soothes both of our tired bodies, and my tired spirit. She whispers ""Hi, Teddy!"" with every page turn, as if it is the first time she has seen him. He is her loyal friend, on every page and always happy. This book relaxes her so well. And it reminds me of the joy and priviledge of being a parent, so that when I leave her room for the night I don't feel beaten to pieces but made whole by my daughter's spirit. This book is a great gift for parents - the one they will pull off the shelf for that bedtime story."
5,One of the sweetest books I have had the pleasure to read,"I, like the other reviewers, couldn't belive the editorial review. When I read this book for the first time in the bookstore I actually stood there with tears in my eyes. The poetic way in which the author conveys the loving relationship between parent and child is simply beautiful. This is an awesome book to add to a collection and a very nice keepsake. My daughter likes the pictures as much as I do. It makes a sweet gift to new parents also."
5,Msvwmommy,"Amazing, Amazing, Amazing. I agree with the wonderful reviews that I have read. I don't understand how anyone who ever has children, nor a heart for that matter, could even think of giving this book a negative review. I will buy every book in this line, which also includes You Are My Miracle. I love it and think that I will love reading it to my duaghter as she grows to a young lady. Such a wonderful way to put our thoughts into children's language in a unique and innocent manner. I, too, cried when reading it in the bookstore and immediately called my own mother to share it with her before wrapping it for Christmas for my little girl. Truly inspirational and heart-felt. A+++++"
5,An author in awe....,"As a writer and a mother of a preschooler, I think this book is one of the best I have ever read. I believe many kids books are not worth the money. Most are pretty goofy. But some occasionally stand out as gems. This one brings me to tears every time I read it. I am going to order it for my son for Christmas and keep it forever. If you have young kids, or older ones, you will find this book says it all about how you love your babies."
5,Perfect,I was flipping through childrens books at Target and randomly picked this one up. As I started to read I was swept away by the beautiful word play. I could easily see my daughter and her baby boy on each page. I read the book outloud to a friend who was shopping with me and we both had tears in our eyes. Just perfect
4,They were the best,They were the first and they were the best! ...The BAD girls of the girl groups. Mellowdrama. These ladies were attracted to the Rebel of the pack.As all young ladies were in that time (60's). The relationship as a pair were always on the run. Running from a society that didn't understand them. They ran away from home to marry but He met the grim reaper in a cycle accident on the way to the Justice of the Peace. Great stuff that kept the girls hearts racing and (us guys secretly liked it too.Good stuff to interject into the old Ipod every here and there.
4,Where is the dvd or blu-ray?,"Just want to put my oar in to release this movie on dvd and/or blu-ray. Please! I am constantly amazed at what is released and what is not released, and this one should be available."
4,Release this movie on DVD!,"I agree with other reviewers that this movie needs to be released in a DVD format. It's a very good movie, one that I enjoyed on VHS but look forward to a much better picture, sound, and other features that DVD provides. Is there somewhere where that emails can be sent requesting ""Surrender"" be released on DVD?Thank you."
4,"A pleasing, funny love comedy","Steel Magnolias was the first one that I saw among Sally Field's movies, and I tend to backtrack her from there. It was interesting to see totally different her in Surrender, but her fundemental characters and actings are still there. One night, I turned on TV and I saw her. Since I rarely watch TV, I could have turned off after a moment if I hadn't seen her. And I kept watching. And I kept watching even though I was tired, and despite all the long commercials. It was not because of Sally Field. It was because the story line was pretty good. Not only it was charming, funny, and pleasing, but also it made me curious of what's going to happen. I ended up watching till the end and slept at 3:00 am, enduring all the commercials. This rarely happened in my life. As a Sally Field fan, I would like to give 5 stars, but to be fair, I would give 4 stars for this movie. Any love commedy fans should like this movie."
1,Mis-leading,This was a disappointment to hear. The sound quality was poor complimented with poor production and singing skills. This is a definate waste of money. A very poor excuse of a tribute to B.I.G.
2,More Like Orange,I've had a red belt w/ double gromet holes for a long time. It was my favorite belt and a great color...perfect shade of red. But since I wore it all the time it eventually began to fall apart; thats when i bought this belt to replace it. It looked exactly the same online but when I received it in the mail the grommet holes were much smaller than my original belt making it a lot more feminine. Also while the belt was red it wasn't the same color of red as my old belt and not even of that on the online picture. Very orangey. I never wear it.
2,Beginner book,"A entry level book, with too much time spent on VLSI issues, with a lot of large screenshoots & large pictures just to fill in the space.The mentioned ""A start-to-finish DSP case study addressing a wide range of design problems"" which made me buy the book is a joke. It's hardly a advanceed DSP unit, more a Harward architecture CPU which implements 5 or 6 instructions and no advanced functionality and design issues which might arise in a complex design.You can find much better synthethiable cores free on internet to learn from them. Save your money if you are anything but a beginer in FPGA."
1,save your money,"I agree with the other negative reviews. This book is a complete waste of money. It only covers the basics--and not very well. The chapter on FPGA fabrics had me scratching my head. I was able to find much better (and much less expensive) resources online. Trust me, there's no topic this book covers that you can't find for free on the Internet. Don't waste your money. Just because someone's from Princeton doesn't mean they know how to write a book."
3,Not for beginners,"I was really disappointed with this book. It does not explain enough FPGA programming to get started, and spends much time covering topics that are probably of interest to people who already know how to use an FPGA and want to use it better.However, as far as I can tell about this, it seems to be an excellent complement to an introduction to FPGAs design. The inner workings of the system are explained in depth and very clearly."
1,Poor Merchandise,This item was not worthy to because not enough technical info was given when item was purchased. As a result I spent 3 days buying adapters that would possibly match this drive and nothing worked. Now I have to purchase another drive.
5,pretty good,"Bought this for my nehpew to learn on and for 80 buck figured why not. He flew my sim a couple times and then i put it together.1. Motor mount glue had broke loose like the review above2. Check switch for the ailerons on the controller. mine was reveresed so left woudl be right and right would be left3. make sure when you adjusting all the controls that everyting is straight with the trim centered on all 3 axismy nephew has nose dived this thing 5 times and i've gone through 9 props and i've replaced nothing else. nothing has broke and the only things i've had to do is tweak with the motor mount after the nose dives...spare parts are cheap5 bucks for a motor, 5 bucks for esc..i've flown it and it'll do inverted flight, barrel rolls, rollsgreat little plane for 80 bucks on [...]"
3,too hard to build,Too many small pieces - too difficult yo assemble - thought it would be easier to build - not too happy
1,Disatisfied!,"I purchased this plane for my husband. The first controller for the plane was received broken. The second controller took 2-weeks to get to us. It was lost in Anaheim somewhere. The controller was received on 12/24 and today (12/26) I came home from work and my husband told me the plane does not work, he cannot get the plane to respond to the controller to do anything. This definately puts me off purchasing things on line."
2,Better deals elswhere,"First off, the way to learn RC flying is with a computer simulatot(great planes real flight) and find the local flying club. The club members will gladly talk with you and someone will take you under their wing. This is a great hobby that the whole family can enjoy. Look at websites like banana hobby, hobby king, and nitro planes. These advertisers on amazon charge so much for shipping!! I have had planes sent from china cheaper than these folks. Take your time and ask questions. It is like learning to ride a bike, boating, motorcycles, real airplanes...the key is start slow and learn on real beginner airplanes and move up. You cannot do this hobby on the cheap. plan on $500.00 before you have all the stuff you need to get started, Good luck...it is a fun sport and the local RC flying club welcomes you! :-)"
2,don't let title fool you,the the problem with the airplane is it so light; flying in any wind made it diffcult to get in the air.Also a 4 channel plane is not the best to learn on if you have no experience flying.overall i don't think the plane is a bust i feel more exerience flying and going out with someone who can teach you would be a plus.
1,This plane is absolutely junk,This plane is absolutely junk. It has cheap materials and it won't fly. Don't waste your money on buying this.
4,Buy. Now.,"Ok I have Hybrid Theory and I am a member of the Linkin Park underground so I already have these 3 songs but trust me, you want this one. One Step Closer is one of the best on Hybrid Theory. High Voltage isn't great but it's got a good beat and it is LP. My December takes a break from the regular stuff with a soft ballad, which is a lot better than you might think."
3,What would you expect from a single?,"The CD's good, but nothing special. It has ""One Step Closer"", the first hit off their debut album HYBRID THEORY and 2 newer tracks of the now released album REANIMATION. All I can say is it's good. Back when it first came out, this was a must buy, but now that REANIMATION has been released, I wouldn't waste my money unless you are a die hard LP fan (which sad to say I'm not). Instead, invest in the new CD METEORA they just released.All in all, this CD is good for a single, but it's better to just get REANIMATION or METEORA."
5,One step closer....,"I bought this single originally because I was going to see them at Ozzfest this year. This cd rocks! One Step Closer is an awesome song and sounds even better live!! These guys put on a great live show, so the live tracks are totally worth the money for this single!"
5,WOW,"This is just the best single that ever hit the earth! I love phat music, and this just happens to work in that regard to me. Only One Step Closer is on the album, Hyvbrid Theory. The others are probably going to be on the second album. This is good, but Hybrid Theory is better value than this."
5,Great,Linkin Park is an awesome band and if your reading this then that probably means that you are debating whether or not to buy this CD. I myself am not much of a person to buy a CD but when I heard this band I knew that I would have to buy the CD to support this awesome band.
2,Too small,"I feel that this product is way too small for the price tag. It is cute, but I think $12 is more appropriate for the tiny size."
4,Kathe Kruse Doll,"My 4 month old loves to gnaw on the ring, as well as the rest of the doll. Very well made. I like that the ring is removable."
4,Sweet,"Bought for my 4.5 year old, and she adores it. It looks just like the photo, but be aware that it is quite small. Daughter doesn't mind this at all. But I'd say that is MY only complaint. It's about 5"" in length. Very cute though."
1,only 22 minutes,I dont know why they dont release all the episodes altogether instead of releasing just one episode perd disc and ripping off fans with selling one episode
4,A captivating tale of the animosity between two undead Lords,"This was only my third Ravenloft novel, and it was far and away the best. Strahd and his mortal enemy Azalin are both terrific characters. Perhaps the most captivating part of PN Elrod's latest effort is the exploration of the mysterious new lands. I recomend this to anyone in the mood for an interesting, quick read(But read I, Strahd part 1 first). Let me also say that I've never participated in any Dungeons and Dragons game either, and I still found I, Strahd: The War Against Azalin very enjoyable."
5,This book was awesome,I truly enjoyed the reading of this book. I know alittle about Ravenloft but this book took me a way from the moment I started reading it. If you love Lord Strahd's adventures then this is the book for you!
2,Azalin IS more powerful then in the book,"After reading 'the Lord of Necropolis', where Azalin was presented as 'virtualy omnipotent', I am a bit disappointed with this one. At the beginning of the book he is superior to Strahd and can deal with everything in Barovia; after he teaches Strahd scraps of his magic it seems that not Strahd becomes more powerful, but Azalin loses his power: a band of goblyns can chase him like he was a rabbit, and he actually runs! There are more examples, he doesn't know a simple travel spell and must ride a horse, and so on. The author seems to put too much of her affection to Strahd, and I put mine to Azalin."
5,Awesome,"This is kinda like the sequel to I, Strahd: Memories of a Vampire..But for true Azalin fans you still need to acquire 2 more books which he stars in..King of the DeadLord of Nercopolis"
4,A was unlike any you have ever known,"When I started reading the book I had no idea as to what Azalin was. When Strahd found out it was almost as much of a surprise to me as it was to him. Both of the characters are well portrayed, and the plot is well developed. This makes an excellent sequel to ""I Strahd: The Memories of a Vampire.""The first part of the book had a good plot that continually increased the tension, and even had me on the edge of my seat, even in the last couple of chapters the action was superb. But after finishing the novel I was a little disappointed, there had a been ""A war unlike any you have ever known"" promised (and I can imagine Strahd has seen some nasty wars), but it just turned out to be a kidnapping and an assignation on 6 people. It was a nice ending, but I was expecting a grand war to take place.All in all, it was a really good book for the Strahd fans out there."
3,Serviceable,"Pretty good for a sequel. As always I should put the usual caveat that game-inspired fiction rarely rises above the level of fanfiction, but this is a fine example of it's breed. Again, Elrod writes in first person journal narrative and she does a fine job in expanding the histories of Strahd and Azalin and of the early Ravenloft plotline overall. If you're a long-time fan it's pretty fun to read firsthand reports of things you've been reading about for years. The only complaint is not enough Azalin! The character is so juicy in his unabashed evil and self-importance that you sail past his entries and want more. Elrod clearly loves the vamp a bit more, and crafts his entries with more care. I read this one on the bus going to and from grad school, a quick and neat read."
5,Dorman Battery Hold Down,"Purchased this as a replacement for my ford ranger, which was missing this item when I purchased it. Up in the rust belt, over time, these (and every other) bolts rust through and snap upon removal attempts, often leaving the remainder of the bolt seized onto the threads (penetrating oil doesnt help). Drill out the old one, clean up the threads, than drop this one in. Perfect fit, works great. These used to be easy to find locally, but, as time goes on, less and less ford vehicles are still on the road that utilize this part. Especially up here...."
4,My son ADORES this book,"I had picked up a great deal of books from this series (Sesame Street book club) used for my son. They are of varying quality, but this one is absolutely a gem and one of his all time favorite books. It uses photographs to show the Twiddlebugs moving from their own cozy but simple home into a fancy dollhouse with all kinds of furniture, and then shows why they decide to move back. My son loves seeing the neat dollhouse furniture, and is fascinated with the whole moving theme! I would recommend trying to get this one!"
5,The Twiddlebugs Dream House,This was an excellent book that I read to my children when they were quite small. I enjoyed the book as much as they did hearing me read it to them. Just delightful!
1,Don't expect a good warranty!,"Purchased this system in March of 04 and the tail pipe already has a hole in it. I've attempted to work many times with Dynomax/Walker Muffler and they say only the muffler is under warranty, what a waste. The safe and sound warranty not worth much to me, look somewhere else for your tahoe exhaust.Regards,Disappointed"
5,"A good cookbook, but a GREAT read","Nigel Slater's cookbooks make excellent bedside reading - except that you will find yourself sneaking downstairs to the dark kitchen to rustle up something from the fridge.... This is a super book for teaching newbie cook some excellent basics, without reading IN ANY WAY like a textbook.I would suggest Nigel Slater's books would make an excellent choice for the cook at ANY stage in their career - beginner right through to professional chef.Gread pictures too - even thought there isn't a picture for every recipe. A great example is the picture of him holding the bread dough, complete with floury hands, showing how it should be done - not just staged picture of dough rising in a bowl. The book and the pictures manage to inspire confidence in me as a cook."
4,Nice and comfy,"The main thing I was worried about when I ordered these was that the inseam would be too short for my 6'1"" sweetie. He generally wears 34"" inseam jeans and these were fine."
3,Review of You Are Here,"I used clips from this film with my students as part of a discussion about Africa and aid. I think it is a useful teaching tool; however, the focus is on the medical student's experience, so there are a lot of ""talking heads"". I would have preferred more footage of the Ugandan village. Films on Uganda are hard to come by, so this will do until something else comes along."
3,"Not bad, but not quite.","I bought ""3D Studio Max 4 Complete"" because it was on CD rather than in book format. With desk space at a premium, this seemed to be a great solution for me. While I have yet to complete all of them, the tutorials have been laid out logically and are relatively easy to understand so far.The main complaint I have about ""3S Studio Max 4 Complete"" is the same one I have about the tutorial manual that ships with 3DS Max 4. There is information that is just plain wrong! Example files are not referrenced correctly, some icon illustrations are incorrect and whole pages of are missing their example illustrations. It is very hard to work when the information given is wrong.I would not recommend this for someone just starting to learn 3DS Max 4, as it is too confusing. As a supplement to my other manuals, it isn't that bad. I've purchased worse and I've purchased better."
3,The forgotten art of reading...,"Well, so far I only read the sixth chapter for a college work I'm doing... but it's pretty easy and simple to understand. Since when is it bad to be academic anyway? Alas, maybe they should write a book called Consumer Culture For Dummies.P.S. Ignore the rating... like I said, I haven't read the entire thing (which is sort of ironic, given the name I chose for this ""review"")."
1,"Aimed at academics, not ordinary readers","If you are looking for an moderately easy read to explain the changing behaviour of consumers in our post-modern society, you need to look elsewhere. This book is obviously aimed at academics and dedicates endless pages to highly theoretical babbling. I found it extremely difficult to extract anything that has practical application."
2,FYI: Mentions death/killing,"Says 4-8yrs, but any book that mentions death especially of a human is a 5+ for me, and this one goes on to say the stepmother ofmrders a daughter KILLED...sorry, but now we're in 6yr old territory..."
5,Sad to say goodbye,I just learned from shopping at Macy's that Gucci's Rush is no longer being produced. Whatever discount stores or places online once sold will not have their supplies restored. It is such a great smelling perfume. The red box was ugly but what was inside was brilliant.
1,Not even the full wrong episode!,"All of the episodes I have watched in this season are completely messed up. They skip around from part of one episode to part of another. I hope Amazon fixes the problem, as I have great nostalgia for this show."
3,The Widows Resource,If one does any reading at all this information is easily available. The Funeral Directors generally give information on these generalities.OK for the price though.
2,The ilustrations are the best part of this recipies book,"Allende's book of recipies is not what some readers, like myself, might expect from the author of such good pieces of literature as The House of Spirits and The Infinite Plan (to name just two). Unlike Laura Esquivel, author of Like Water for Chocolate, Allende did not accomplished a work that put together the art of cooking and sensuality and still can be call literature, just a simple book of recipies. It can be said that part of the content of this book consists of some recycle material from previous works by Allende. However, the selection of the ilustrations and the art work is very good (and the edition certainly atractive)."
4,Yo también me arrepiento..,"Es inevitable, no arrepentirse de las cosas de las que se arrepiente la autora.Las recetas están bastante bien introducidas en el texto, aunque lo veo un poco forzado, no hay una unidad, son historias aisladas que a veces no pegan demasiado bien con la receta en cuestión y te quedas un poco a medias, ( en la receta y en la historia), pero es ameno y original.A mi entender éste y los demás libros de Isabel Allende, pecan un poco de ""aburguesados"" y ésto no me gusta demasiado, tniendo en cuenta que pretende escribir precisamente para un público no burgués.Tampoco me gusta la excesiva diferencia entre las ediciones existentes. La calidad del papel y de las ilustraciones es abismal, no así los precios.Que también pecan de ""burgueses""."
2,Not as good as I thought,I was excited when I bought this DVD. Not too much about Madoff himself. He is not on the DVD all that much. Just a lot of other people talking about him. It does have some interesting facts. I just wish they would have included more in there about the man himself.
4,Messenger pack review,I really love this pack. they give you plenty of move-able-velcro dividers to configure the camera pack to your liking. My one complaint is the the back side of the pack is made a fine knit polyester fabric that tend to snag and get runs in it very easily.I'm afraid to think what it will look like in a few years?
4,Never judge a book by its cover,"Whatever posessed me to buy this book would have to be the cover. Like it's prequel LITTLE SISTER, the cover was beautiful and enchanting. So was the gorgeous and moreover overwhelming covers of COURT DUEL and CROWN DUEL. Well, the story wasn't much of a read, it was rather weak, little romance, little conclusion. I just wanted to rant and rave about this book's cover, the designer and drawer is fantastic and should keep this up! Way to go editor Jane Yolen!"
4,This book is a great introduction to Buddhism.,"It clearly explains the basic ideas, without excessive jargon. Important terms like ""Dharma"" and ""Sangha"" are explained, but for the most part, the ideas are explained simply, in plain English. The important concepts are explained thoroughly enough for basic understanding, but it doesn't get too deep, so it's ideal for beginners. There was a very helpful section on how to deal with anger. I heartily recommend this section especially. It is true that freeing oneself of anger is important in Dharma practice, but the simple, practical solutions in this section will be helpful to anyone that has problems with anger, Buddhist or not. In general, this book is a good jumping off point for the study of Buddhism."
4,Mix book,"This was the first book i bought when i decided to begin magic thing. Well, actually, this is a great book but it not only contains basic stuff - beginners - but also it contains very advanced stuff - yet i cannot do - so i really suggest this book, since i learned amazing tricks from this book... Have Fun!!"
2,Having troubles,"Hmm, I'd like to think that I'm an intelligent person, but if I gauge it by my success with this product I will have to question that. I received my Canopus today, and I've been playing with it for almost 4 hours now, with no success. I cannot get any display on the computer, and the fact that I have to download a secondary software package to 'capture' the video is less than ideal. I will struggle with it for a while more, but I'm teetering on tossing it out the window right now. If someone has some suggestions, I'm open. jason"
2,Patios and Walkways,The projects were unattractive and the construction/installation information was nothing more than a quick web search would provide.
3,good,this too was a good do it yourself help. Good informatoin and ideas on how to fix things in yard.
3,"Generally helpful, not specific","This book is great for getting a few ideas about patios/walkways/decorative walls etc.It has a bunch of good tips for beginner landscapers, but nothing too in-depth.If you're looking to do a couple of weekend projects around the house/yard this book is what you're looking for.If you're looking to do a more substantial project (which I am in a new patio) then this book only gets you ~1/2 way there.It tells you what the general sequence of events must occur to create a patio or walkway or what have you, but usually only one example of each.If you want to do a concrete patio or mortared flagstone patio or walkway there might not be enough info in this book to answer all of your questions, but can get you started on the right path.Overall a good buy for reference and some ideas to do-it-yourself landscaping of all types, but generally not detailed enough to give you all the ins and out for larger or tricky projects."
1,"Do Not Buy, Broke after 1 month",This one broke after 1 month of use! So now I'm back to using my original Sony adapter which has been working for the last 5 years!
3,Hotter than the original,"The charger works OK. It just gets hotter than the original did. Not enough to worry about, just significantly warmer. This charger has a heavy duty wire between the charger and the computer and it's much shorter than the original, so the charger has to be on the table with the computer most of the time instead of on the floor. With this heavy duty wire, it is easy for it to become unplugged from the computer if the laptop is moved. Especially when moving the computer so someone else can see the screen. The wire going from the outlet to the charger is plenty long, so you still can be away from an outlet. With the charger on the table, if someone trips over the plug-in wire, it will almost always pull the charger off the table and drop to the floor. I liked the original charger better where it naturally just sat on the floor, and the wire going to the computer was much smaller and longer. But this one was one fourth the cost, so I got what I paid for. I would buy another one."
5,Former Student,This book is an excellent and informative book with an objective viewpoint of the Augustan era and its significance for the Roman Empire and Western Civilization. It details how the fundamentals of the Age of Augustus provided the foundations of the empire that survived the lunatic reins of Nero and Caligula as well as the unheralded expansion that brought diverse cultures and people into the Roman flock. I had Prof.Galinsky for a Roman Culture class and he is an excellent and entertaining teacher. Read what the man has to write.
4,Wonderful surprise,"When I bought this I expected the only song worth listening to would be ""Here Comes The Sun"" and I was horribly mistaken. This album is full of great original versions as well as songs I never heard him perform.If you do not like the sound of music recorded at low quality then you should definitely skip this, but if you are like me then the classic sound will just make it a better experience for you.If you have never purchased a Peter Tosh album before then start with Equal Rights, but if you are a Tosh fan and have other albums of his (personally I owned two before buying this) then by all means you should buy this right now."
3,Ok but not impressed,"I was expecting for many creative ways to announce our pregnancy and couldn't find that many ideas. In fact, as they have creative ways to announce to your partner, the grandparents or family, some of the ideas were repeated from one to the other.It did stimulate my creativity and we came out with our own nice way to tell my parents when they came for a long visit. We decorated the room were they were going to stay with ballons saying ""it's a boy"", ""it's a girl"" (as we don't know yet) and baby diapers garlands. We put a rope with baby clothes hanged up as if they were just washed. The last touch was an announcement card over the pillows. My mom couldn't stop crying!"
2,Only one bulb works - I gave it two and a half stars,"I previously purchased the Rayovac SP8DA Black Sportsman 8D Lantern from a local store and liked it a lot. With the prediction of Super Storm Sandy hitting the Northeast, I decided to buy another one, this time from Amazon. From the moment I added the batteries and turned it on, only one bulb has worked. I am really disappointed with this purchase.Just have not had the time to return it!"
5,As much light as 75 watt bulb,"We had this lantern during the Sandy power loss and it gives sufficient light to do most tasks including reading. It is 300 lumens of light and most lanterns do not have that much. The night light and 1/2 on, all on options are useful too.The 8 D cell batteries will last 15 or more hours.I bought one each for my relatives -for the next time."
5,Outstanding lantern to have for emergencies,"I bought this ahead of time thinking if my electricty ever went out I'd at leasta little light, well this Rayovac fills the whole room it is wonderful forhome and camping. This a must to have around the house and even a gift forfriends."
1,JUNK,"Bought this last summer but never used it...until Sandy it. I put in the batteries and, silly me, expected it to actually work. Instead the bulbs stayed on for only a few minutes, then poof. One bulb dims, then a few minutes later, the other goes out. After fiddling with this piece of junk for a while, I just let it sit in the off position for a few minutes... When I turned it on again, the lights came back on, but, again, only for a short time... then the same thing repeated. The only thing that consistently worked was the tiny nightlight, but when your whole house is dark, who needs that? Waste of $25 bucks."
5,Essential for Emergency Supplies,"I love this lantern. It is durable, efficient, reliable -- perfect for a power outage as well as camping. A great, practical gift for anyone you care about.It's easy to carry, compared to other models. It brightens an entire room and provides enough light to read by. You don't have to recharge it every few months as required by the rechargeable versions.During a power outage when the whole neighborhood went dark, we were all lit up. Everyone thought we still had electricity.In Emergency Preparedness training we were taught that having light in the darkness can be a life saver. Always carry a small, bright flashlight with you -- you never know. And be sure you have a Ryovac Spotsman 8D Fluorescent Lantern. :-)"
5,Perfect for when a power outage strikes...,"Lots of light, excellent night-light mode, good size, good weight, seems quite sturdy, bought two and glad I did (day four of no power in the northeast...)"
4,Lantern,"It gives a nice, bright light for a small lantern. Its light will not light my whole bedroom as the larger ones do but it is still valuable when the electricity goes out."
4,Lots of light provided,We bought this Lantern after losing our power from Hurricane Sandy. This puts out an amazing amount of light and will be great to have if we ever lose power again.
5,Lightweight lantern,We bought this for use indoors for power outages. We have tried it out and it works well. Now we don't have to get out our Coleman camp lantern. No fumes or heat generated. Ideal for our purpose.
5,OUTRAGEOUS SHIPPING CHG.,"THE COMB IS THE BEST FOR THAT TYPE OF PRODUCT...BUT $8 TO MAIL A $4 PRODUCT THAT COULD BE PUT IN AN ENVELOPE WITH ONE STAMP, IS JUST OUTRAGEOUS."
3,Blocks the light well but a little stiff,"The canopy is made of a heavy fabric that blocks the light very well. It looks like it will last a long time. However, in order to achieve this light-blocking it feels a little stiff and can be uncomfortable when used for a more than just a few minutes. I don't use it much any more because it is just not all that comfortable, but in a pinch will give you some good light blocking."
2,It is really a teaching dvd,"I thought I was purchasing a workout dvd. But it is really a training DVD for personal trainers. It just shows you how to use the bosu ball. It is NOT a fitness routine! You can just watch the dvd and take notes on how to use the bosu. If want to follow along with the dvd I suggest you purchase Master your body dvd series ""Body Bar and Bosu training"" It's an excellent routine!!!!"
4,GREAT IDEAS FOR TRAINING CLIENTS ON BOSU,Lots of great ideas. I would have liked verbal ques on body form but found this very beneficial as a personal trainer.
4,classically elegant,"i bought this watch as a dressier companion to another pulsar watch i bought on amazon and it fits the bill perfectly. the face is slim-line and good for a woman with a medium frame. the difference in the shades of blue on the sides and top and bottom is not as obvious as it is in the picture, but it's still very worthwhile."
4,Great read,"Utilizing his life experiences, Mr. Barger spins this tale straight from the streets, bars, and crowds he and his members once ruled. Very entertaining!!"
1,"Good book, Amazon is a bad place purchase from","This bad review is not for the book, but for the company I purchased it from Amazon. I ordered and paid for book, receaved a email that it was shipped ( up to 14 days to deliver) at the end of the 14 days I receaved another email that the company was out of stock and would refund my money. How could they be out of stock if they already mailed out the book? To bad Amazon will not let you rate there web sight.I went down to a local book store and purchesed the book...Its very good reading Id give the book Dead in 5 Heartbeats a 5 star review....very good reading."
1,This is not a good book.,"I didn't like this book. I liked Sonny's other books but this one was senslessly violent. I don't like to read stories about people who stab other people. I can't imagine anyone liking this book. It's about the motorcycle club called the ""Infidels"".They seem to really have a problem with other motorcycle clubs.The Infidels take thier revenge on a rival motorcycle club with lead pipes, knives, and guns. It is horrible. Lots of people are killed and some are seriously wounded. One of the Infidelscalled ""Patch"" carries a knife and he stabs many people. He seems to like to stab people. I was glad to finally finish the book. I put the book away in my bedroom closet. I don't think I'll want to read it again. Perhaps Sonny's next book will be less violent. I like to read stories about having fun on motorcycles. Killing people doesn't sound like fun."
4,nice.,really catchy and very groovy death/grind. if you like bands you can bob you head to then just get this.
4,The power of Vince Jones,"I'm surprise to be the first person to review this wonderful CD of Vince Jones, maybe not the best but also in this case Vince bring you in a elegant atmosphear and sometimes he can bring you directly to the heaven (it's the case of Nature of Power). I always think that Vince Jones doesn't live very much during the day but he works for you at night"
4,This Was My Third Pair,"I wore out the webbing on the last two pairs and the thumb holes are too tight on this pair, but I really like these gloves anyway. I am a speed bag ""boxer"" for aerobic exercise and am also trying to keep the inevitable upper arm sag at bay for as long as possible; I am not a professional."
5,FANTASTIC!,This was her first novel that I've read....and now I have to read the rest. I loved the storyline & everything. It was a wonderful work!!
3,So-So,"This book was okay, it just felt like she was missing something. It did keep you guessing to the last minute."
3,A book club selection,"If You Want me was a bookclub selection for this month. It is going to be very interesting getting the viewpoint on this story.I was not convinced who Marcus loved . Did he love Alice or Desiree. Did he love ( Alice )The girl he knew years ago like he said ? Maybe he love Desiree The woman she's become. It was quite obvious how Alice felt about Marcus after all those years . I guess in this case it's true, love never dies it just fades way only to be rekindled . I was right about two predictions in the story . One why her mother disliked her aunt. The other, who was really after Desiree and wanted to destroy her .It is going to be interesting to hear what other members of the bclub has to say about If You Want Me."
3,product description not accurate,The product description indicated that the horse had a wooden base but the base is plastic. I ordered this version of the rocking horse because it indicated that it had a wooden base. So I was disappointed when it arrived and it was plastic.
5,Eh up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"These albums sound great remastered. The only problem I have is that Anagram decided to tone down the liner notes and change some of the words. I guess they have to try and appeal to the limpwristed lefty punk crowd who might happen to buy this. If you are an easily offended, PC college opinionated nerd punk, then you might wanna just stick with your Leftover Crack or Anti-Flag or silly Business or Cocksparrer ""streetpunk"". The Macc Lads are not for you. Go back to your cardboard box in front of your parents mansion with your $2000 laptop and pretend like you are squatting...This music is for people with problems and it is great!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"Warm, comfortable music","I discovered Jenn Grant because of the TV series Heartland (Dreamer is the opening song). She has a lovely, soulful voice. The rest of the album doesn't disappoint; it's a very pleasant collection that's a treat for a road trip or a walk."
2,I think I got a dud,I bought this as a gift for my sister but it doesn't work in her CD player. She was able to load the songs on her ipod and likes the album itself.
2,Disappointing,"I'm a long time fan of Lippman's series novels but this stand alone effort was a disappointment. It seemed as though the author herself did not like any of the characters. Readers never get to know any of them fully nor have reason to ""root for"" any one of them. Likable characters become more despicable as the story progresses and previously contemptible characters fade from the story (with one notable exception). Normally, when I finish a Lippman novel I reach for the next one. When I finally finished this one, I closed the volume thinking, I did not like this book."
3,Lippman can do better,"I loved ""What the Dead Know,"" my first Laura Lippman novel, so I eagerly anticipated reading her again. This one did not pack the wallop of the other book. It was a good read, but fell apart with the predictable resolution. I will give this author another chance, however."
2,Sloppy,"I've never read anything by Lippman before, and guessed this was her first book. She certainly has some talent as a writer, with the wonderful turn of a phrase here and there. But this book seemed so inconsistent and fragmented, I chalked it up to inexperience. I was surprised to discover this wasn't in fact her debut novel. I can't say I would read anything else of hers. This book just seemed sloppy."
2,Bestseller? Not quite,"I really wanted to like this book. I was looking for a great mystery but this just didn't cut it. There were too many superficial characters and subplots that amounted to nothing. About half way through, I remember thinking that the story seemed to be dragging on way too long. I couldn't wait until it ended."
1,A waste of money,This book was not good. To much background on everyone in the book and it meant nothing. Save your money
4,Great read,This was the first book I read by this author. I found it to be a very good read and read it quickly. Plot was good and characters were well defined. Some parts were a little slow. It did jump around a lot to all the different characters but author did a good job with that.Overall I would recommend this book and will read more from this author
3,"Three stars for the story, two stars for the audiobook","Though I was interested enough to finish the audiobook, this narrator's inability to do different voices was distracting and unpleasant. Every voice sounded like a shrieky church lady. The only differential was whether or not characters had southern accents (bad, sharp ones). A Baltimore accent sounded like a comedian's bad imitation of a Brooklyn accent. IT would have been much better if the narrator had just read the story without differentiating voices, she actually had good pacing and tone for the narrative parts of the book.As for the story, it was not on a par with Ruth Rendell or mystery authors whose psychological studies are much more complex and gripping. On the other hand, I have to wonder if I would have found the book more satisfying with a better narrator."
2,Boring.....,I expected more from this book based on the reviews. I was disappointed. I got so bored!!!!! It took me two weeks to finish this since i fall asleep everytime i try to read.
2,Not my fave,Too disjointed- too many characters. What was the point of Mira? Not as well written as others. What the Dead Know was much better.
2,I could see it coming,"I could see something wrong with the setup from the start of the novel so maybe that soured it a bit for me. There were a few twists with the Mom, but Alice was too good. Some good twists at the end, but the storyline wasn't that interesting to me with the racist thing going on, in your face, spelling out who's this color, who's that color, who's mixed, defining everyone rich, poor, shoving them into a socioeconomic class as if that makes the book more interesting. For me, it didn't. I was so disappointed because this author's mysteries were highly recommended. If I hadn't been in the emergency room waiting for someone and with nothing to do but read, I am not certain I'd have finished EVERY SECRET THING at all. But I am glad I did, just not delighted with the journey."
4,Every Secret Thing,"I found Every Secret Thing to be pretty fascinating. It was one of those novels that I found myself hurrying through daily tasks to read. The topic is dark, so I was a little concerned it would be too much for me to handle. Laura Lippmann, however, handled it deftly and with tact. The only real complaint I have is that I felt the ending was a bit rushed. I would have liked Ronnie and Alice's relationship to have been delved into deeper. I walked away with several questions, but that's not always a bad thing."
4,They say girls are surgar and spice,"But, the two girls we are introduced to in Ms. Lippman's Every Secret Thing show just how depraved or misunderstood children can be. This book is part mystery, part police procedural, and part social commentary, which blends well. The characters are shown warts and all with all of their strengths and weaknesses. There is no single person in this novel who doesn't show their ugly side, which is not a common trait in books of this type where characters tend toward comfortable archetypes. The writing is solid and the story easy to follow with a few moments that catch the reader off guard. Like the other novels I've read by this author, I enjoyed myself."
5,Everything you Need to Grow Grass!,This book has everything you need to create a beautiful lawn. I covers every problem you might ever in encounter and is a very readable 200 pages. It's one draw back is that it does not have color pictures. I (and my neighbors) have seen an immediate improvement in my lawn since I changed to lawn care practices mentioned in the book.
5,A Comprehensive Guide,"Ever since I bought my first house three years ago (with the worst lawn I have seen), I have been asking people how to make it better. I've tried a few things and been told to try much more. I never was good at understanding plants and soil, so I was looking for a book that explained how and why my lawn grew, why it was thin, weedy, etc. I didn't want someone to tell me ""Just do this and that"" but more of an educational tool that empowered me to decide what was best for my lawn.This book has answered all of my questions in a way easy for me to grasp. It's too cold now to do anything, but I will use this book next spring. I like how the authors try to be environmentally conscious without being afraid to use modern chemicals when they are best. I would recommend this book to evey homeowner in the North. (...)"
4,The ultimate lawn care book for everyone but the rich,"I always figured that people worked too hard on their lawns,just to make them look good for a few months...especially here in the NorthEast. Well, this book not only confirmed my suspicions, but showed the average person how to acheive a beautiful lawn with minimal care, time and expense. With its easy reading, 1-2-3 tips, and including the 'what-not-to-dos', everyone should get this book and keep it handy year after year."
4,"If you have a passion for Magma, you need this album","You love Magma or you don't. No half measure. If you are in the first category, then you need the complete collection. This double album is somewhat calmer that their usual music, more melodious, with fully developed pieces."
2,before internet,"Mathis' book obtained from abq library, suggests pandering to the liberal arts 'educated' media for visibility. Internet makes Mathis' book obsolete. Mathis writes liberal arts 'educated' BS."
1,Feeding the media beast,"I paid for the book on 5/24/2011. Supose to receive the book on 6/14/2011 and never happend. I feel so dissapointed about the service. I'm a master student, buy the book for a class i've been taking and never receive the book. I don't want my money back, I need the book and I want it cause I buy for it.Thanks for nothing...Feeding the Media Beast: An Easy Recipe for Great Publicity"
5,Maybe my favorite kids' book of all time...,"Well, the title says it all. One of my favorite lines is Hetty jingling the money in her pocket and saying ...this must be what it feels like to be grown up-- to have money in your pocket and be walking down the road...I'm a librarian and when I read this to kindergarten through third grade they are all hushed when Hetty drops the eggs. I mean, this is her first big trip to the store alone, and she has begged to go. And Papa has gone out on a limb for her and told Mama that she was big enough to go by herself, absolutely.The watercolors by E.B. Lewis are magnificent. The best one of all is Papa standing at the bottom of the tree looking up at Hetty as if he were angry. The reader really doesn't know what will happen. Forgiveness happens. It's wonderful. Please read it to all the young children you know."
4,Great parenting in action - unconditional love at it's best!,"When a child tries hard to obey mom and dad, but ends up cracking all the eggs she was to fetch, dad and mom find her in a tree scared to go home. The love they show through their actions is parenting at it's best."
4,Uber Geeks of the Seventies Unite!!,"Well this is an awesome addition to anybody's seventies sci-fi collection. For those who loved the original ""Battlestar Galactica"" of ABC television (1978 - 1979) this is an essential find. It is, also, however quite rare as is much Original Series ""Battlestar Galactica"" memorabilia. This particular one was in excellent condition and I'm pleased as punch to have it. To be sure there are a number of inaccuracies regarding the mythos of Galactica (saying the Borays, for instance are native to Equellus when in fact they are native to Sectar) but there's so much of the rich history of the colonies and back story to the Galactica universe that its worth overlooking this small detail. Also, the pictures are glorious. One of the hottest pics of Athena!"
2,"Brief, uninspired mystery.","Joan Aiken's ""Died on a rainy sunday"" was quite boring, and thankfully brief. It's about Jane Drummond and the malice that the McGregors who live in the nearby weir nurse towards her and her husband, Graham. Long-hidden and dark secrets are revealed, but the characters are just not that interesting at all."
2,Ugh,"This book was very bad. They just HAPPEN to meet up with Snow White's foal. And also, fillies can not have foals when they are three, as it claims Snow White did. I only gave this book two stars because it was one of the better Pony Pals books."
2,Only 12 pages on Pattaya in a 1000 page book???,"I was truly disappointed in this book. While it contains over 1000 pages, Pattaya gets a mere 12 of them. The author states that a third of all visitors to Thailand go to Pattaya. If that is the case, much more of the book should have been devoted to it."
2,Much Room for Improvement,"With the wealth of free information available on the web at sites like pattayaland.com and others, I expected much more for my money. I don't fly half way around the world for nothing. When I buy a guide book, I'm looking for information that will be useful to me on my trip. I don't want a Thai history or sociology book."
3,If you want companny,"I went to Thailand accompanied with the Lonely Planet book, and everywhere I went, I found people carrying the same book--sometimes in different languages.If you want to take the road MOST travelled, then buy this book and go to all the restaurants and hotels they recommend. If you only want to see other ""Lonely Planet people"", then this is the book for you.I was so frustrated, I stopped reading the book 5 days into the trip and started using common sense. In such a friendly country, common sense is more than u need!"
5,We Don't Need More Pattaya Info.,"This is in response to readers who complained about only 12 pages being devoted to Pattaya, and wanted more. We don't need more information on Pattaya. I've been to Pattaya several times and love the place. It is a small, yet significant part of Thailand. Pattaya is a tourist area that has plenty of info. on the Web, and in its many ""cheezy tourist brochures."" Many establishments change management and names frequently there as well. Pattaya is a no-brainer. It is typically for the shallow, culturally repugnant people who need ""luxury"" hotels and horrible western food. Most of the Thai food there was fake and overpriced, like everything else in the tourist vicinity. LP is for those who want to learn, yes learn, something about the culture, people, and nation in which they are traveling. Don't get me wrong I love Pattaya, but we didn't need more info. on in it in this edition of Lonely Planet. Great Book."
4,More melon than Mango,"Wow this smells wonderful! It's not really mango scented in my opinion, more melon than anything. Very fresh, maybe the lightest hint of flowers, but very fruity and perfect for summer. This also reminds me of Calgon Melon Ice (I used to wear when I was 16)."
4,A Good Read,"I have read other works by Graham Masterton, and I found him to be a very good horror writer. In his latest work, The House That Jack Built, it starts out a bit slow at first, but picks up the pace. The setting in New Orleans is what really made me pick up this book since I have read other horror stories by Anne Rice and Poppy Z. Brite that took place in the same area. It was a good ghost story and I found myself finishing it in what seemed to be a day and half. It isn't the greatest book of horror that I have read so far, but it was enjoyable and I think it was worth my time."
2,Not one of his best,"Masterton has written a *lot* of books, of which I've read a few. Of those, I'd have to place this one somewhere in the middle.It starts out great, builds on some interesting ideas about the flexibility of time, if you use the right kind of architecture, and keeps your attention and continues to be creepy for about 3/4 of the way. Then it seems like Masterton gets lazy and relies on some horror cliches that will make anyone who has seen a few horror films groan. One of the characters even thinks to himself that the situation he's in is like the film ""Don't Look Now"". The characters do things like walk around a spooky house separately when they know it's dangerous. That's like a joke out of the first ""Scream"" movie! And there are scenes that will remind readers too much of ""The Shining"".Because this book started out so well, I can rate it higher than Masterton's ""Basilisk"", but it comes nowhere near the level of ""The Hell Candidate"" and ""House of Bones"", both of which I recommend."
2,Too unpleasant,"I enjoy a good ghost story, and there are so few around. I hoped this would satisfy but I didn't even finish it. It's needlessly gory and filled with unpleasant images (starting right off with the hammer and testicle bit) that don't really seem necessary. Someone said Masterson is as good as the best Stephen King, which to me is not a good thing. I still have bad memories of the ""puppy-in-the-refrigerator"" episode from ""It,"" which was just for shock value and turned me off King for good. Won't bother with Masterson's books any more, either."
5,WOW!!,I just got done reading this book. I could not put it down!! One of his best It took less than 24hrs to read if you love Graham Mastertons books this is a must read LOVED IT!
3,"A good read, but mind boggling....","This was a strange book, being able to go to another time. I thought it was something totaly different than this. I don't want to say too much to spoil it for you. If your a MASTERton fan, then buy this book."
3,Maybe I don't get it?,"I've enjoyed most of Graham Masterton's novels as he is an unusually reliable writer. I picked up this book after several fellow horror readers named it as one of their top five haunted house novels. Well, I read it, but I can't say I agree with this determination. The writing is fine, and the characters are fairly well-developed, but in the end, it turned out to be another ""Why are you going back into the house, you idiot?"" story.Some of the mystery surrounding the house was interesting, but mostly I didn't buy the characters' motivations. I also didn't get the usual frisson of fear Masterton can usually evoke. On the plus side, the book is an easy read, and I suspect most Masterton and/or horror fans will enjoy it well enough.Sorry Graham, your haunted house story is fine, but it didn't make my top five."
3,Solid Masterton,"This was a thrilling and unique take on the traditional haunted house story. I did find that there were more moments of gore than fright, but overall it's simply typical Masterton. I enjoyed watching the surprises unfold, though if you're looking for a more traditional ghost story or haunting, there's many other authors to choose from, including John Harwood, Peter Straub, and James Herbert."
3,Great ghost novel,"While a fast read, the first half was so so but the last half was quite exciting and intriguing.Very nice twist to the ghost story. Really surprised me in the end."
3,"If you don't know GTR and Astrophysics, forget this book","This is a mathematical book. If you do not know Relativity (Special and General), forget this book. If you do not know Tensors, forget it. That said, if you are not a practicing professional astronomer or astrophysicist, forget this book. Nice cover photo!"
2,For beginners only,This may prove useful if you've never heard of a value proposition before but it lacks enough content to help create much of a marketing plan. The writing seems amateurish - punctuation and grammatical errors abound. The book is really little more than a pamphlet advertising the services of the author.
2,Not Developed Yet,"Fans of the show may be surprised to recall that Chris Tilton wasn't always the composer. This album is mixed from a few different composers. Giacchino is better known, but I don't think the Fringe pilot score he did is particularly impressive, and it took a while after the pilot for the show to find its voice, musically and otherwise. There are a lot of really atonal action tracks on this disc, and I don't much enjoy listening to it (and haven't in a while). There has been some beautiful thematic music written for Fringe, but I'd check out the later seasons first, which have more focused and better music. Season 1 is for completists only, in my mind."
4,Cool (nerdy)factor,"I love this clock. At one point i was looking for a cool clock for my office at work. I found it! I bought this about 4 years ago and it has never failed me. I use it every day all day long and EVERYONE comments on it. My wife makes fun of me over it, it makes people happy.If it dies tomorrow, I'll bury it and buy a new one!Why 4 stars and not 5? its not ALWAYS 100 F in my office (yes the thermometer doesn't work very well)"
4,BIG Megazooka,"Bought this for my 11 yr. old at Christmas. This thing works just like its supposed to-really fun. I just didn't realize how large the thing was! Makes it hard to store so that it won't get broken. Otherwise, it's a ""blast"", no pun intended."
2,Broke after 2 days,Not sure what went wrong but just stopped working after 2 days. The clip that hold the bag back so you can use the trigger to shoot it just stopped holding it. Not broken or worn... just would not hold due to poor design. Trigger mechanism is just a little hook over the back of unit and trigger just pushes it off.
2,Mega what?,"I own the original Airzooka, and this really isn't any different. The only differences are a fake scope, a second handle and a trigger mechanism so you don't have to keep the string held back when waiting for a target. It literally has the same amount of power as the Airzooka. And you still have to pull the string back to fire. I feel ripped off bigtime."
5,love this mat,"I am so happy that I found a yoga mat that is not only efficient but also extremely environment-friendly. This mat is pretty to look at, durable, and comfortable to work with. I would recommend it to any of my friends or family members interested in yoga."
3,Not Bad,"Not a bad review of Freddie's life. The director/writer uses a lot of one on one interviews of those that knew Fred. Plus, he uses a lot of recreation of early events in Freddie's life. I wish they would have used more original video of interviews with Mercury and would have interviewed his band mates more.Overall, not bad."
5,Incredibly touching.,"I am biased. Am a HUGE Queen fan & esp fan of Freddie. This is a very frank, touching & honest documentary of Freddie's life. I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who appreciated & loved Freddie's talent & unique personality."
5,great product where a little goes a long way,"I love this product. I originally tried the shampoo and conditioner through the travel size and used it for a week. The best buy is in the 1/2 gallon form. You pay less per ounce and the pump dispenser allows you to minimize waste. If you have a wide tooth comb, try combing the conditioner through your hair and let it set while you finish your bathing. This will allow the small amount to work through your hair. My co-workers asked me if I had done something different to my hair. It was the change in product that made the difference. You will be happy with this. A little goes a long way."
2,Not a happy camper.,"I wouldn't buy from this seller again. The product was fine, but the service wasn't that great. It took multiple complaints to the vendor and at least 3 weeks to get my product. While they were apologetic, they were slow at responding and correcting the issue."
4,"Mozart's Piano Sonatas: Contexts, Sources, Style","This is a very scholarly work, in fact it reminded me of a master's thesis or doctoral dissertation revised for popular publication. It is the most thorough and detailed study of Mozart's piano sonatas I have yet found and even so I had hoped for a more complete analysis of how to play the sonatas well. As an adult piano student, I wanted advice as to how to interprent theme, motif and emotion in the various sonatas. This book presents a complete historical perspective on the sonatas but didn't provide the guidance on performance I was hoping for. As part of the library for a serious student, however, it is a must, albeit expensive."
4,Must-read for 21st century people,"This is a brilliant and uncompromising synthesis of scientific knowledge about human nature and perception, stated with the confidence of a front-line investigator but also with sympathy for less rigorous world-views. Anyone who has ever asked 'Why are people like this?' should read this account in order to grasp what scientists take for granted. If the author was not able to explore the psychological appeal of religious belief fully, that is a lot to demand of a brief, well focused work."
1,False Advertising,"This describes itself as ""How the Science of Child Development Explains What Makes Us Human"" and there are a few cute little anecdotes about child development. But these are interspersed among long rambling philosophical discussions about what art critics and artists think is art and what philosophers, rabbis and the bible think is morality. It is like a little, anecdotal scientific information filled out with whatever else he can think of that is vaguely related. Read Stephen Pinker or Robert Wright instead."
2,Philosophic Leanings,"Although the author does discuss Descartes, and the author is brilliant, I have to say that, again, as with most books on philosophic studies and opinions, this presentation lacks the structural detail that a student might use to an advantage. Far too much bits and pieces, too much dialog not addressing Descartes really immature ventures in his method of finding self, which is not a self anyone sane would realize. Just, eh, brillant man, but who cares when Descartes is so limited in personal and creative consciousness."
2,Not the real thing,This book is not based on too many facts. I think the author saw a chance to make money based on the public hunger for information about the recluse of the millennium.
1,This is Not a Review,"I am currently reading 'The Hoax' which I picked up at a yard sale. It is certainly interesting, but I was curious so I went to Amazon to see what the buzz was about it and if he really did write a book on Hughes that was totally fake.The NERVE of this guy. Are you telling me he presented this book to the public as fact and then said later on that is was not? How could he do such a thing, and didn't we learn from Orson Welles huge egg that hoaxing the public is childish and makes you look desperate?So, poor old James Frey had to go down in front of the Queen herself and we all just think this Clifford was 'clever'?Sheesh.Also, what is this OTHER Howard Hughes book that he wrote, Howard Hughes: My Story? Is that a hoax, too?"
4,Just a cheap keboard,This keyboard is cheap and get the job done. When I first got it I was surprised by just how light this keyboard is. The keyboard as very short travel distance and almost feels comparable to a laptop. Had I payed more than ~$12 this would be a poor typing experience but for the price it does everything I could expect of it. It is also low-profile which took some adjusting in wrist placement compared to my old default Dell keyboard.
3,not as pictured,"I ordered this GE keyboard because it was pictured as the same GE keyboard I needed to replace. But when I received it, it was black, and the ""enter"" key was not the large L-shaped key as pictured, but the standard smaller key. So although the keyboard is serviceable, it is not as pictured."
2,"Good keyboard, but shutdown key is inconveniently placed.",This is a good keyboard and I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the shutdown key which is placed directly below the delete key making it really easy to turn the computer off accidentally. These buttons would have been better placed in the upper right hand corner far above the numeric keypad where they can do less damage.
5,Great GE keyboard,"I had a GE Power keyboard and loved the feel of the keys as well as the relatively small footprint. Some Microsoft keyboards are larger than the clear area of my desk. However, I could not remember where I bought it, nor could I find one anywhere, even on internet. We were preparing to leave Phoenix in late March to return to our farm in Southern Illinois and I took one more internet search in hopes I could leave the existing keyboard in our new El Mirage house. Wonderful, Amazon was selling the GE. I bought three, I love them so much. Everyone is different, but I have fewer keystroke errors with this keyboard than any other I have used. I am 64, a retired CPA, and I have been forced to use many different keyboards."
2,Cheap and chearful,"Low profile and low key travel. Flimsy - the box it came in is stronger! Don't be fooled by the name - this is very low build quality. I was concerned about buying a keyboard that I hadn't tried, and I wasn't wrong. Don't make the same mistake that I did."
1,Serious design flaw,"Working on this keyboard was unbelievably annoying - they actually put a shutdown key just below the ""delete"" button. Ever so often your finger slips - and BUMM - the computer's shutting down.Do not buy this keyboard unless you really enjoy frustration."
1,Horrible Design Flaw: Power Button by the Arrow Keys,"The keyboard is cheap--I bought it to be my abuse keyboard so I don't mess up my nice one when I get angry or play button-mashing video games. Everything is about what you would expect from a cheap keyboard, but someone at GE had the brilliant idea of putting power, suspend, and sleep right above the arrow keys. If your fingers slip or are misplaced, the results can have consequences. Essentially, these three extra buttons have caused me more trouble than the keyboard was worth. It's seldom that you find a product ruined by an added feature, but that's exactly what this is. If it weren't for those stupid keys and all games they're ruined and unsaved documents I've lost, this keyboard would be a worthwhile way to spend ten bucks. Look elsewhere if you're looking for a keyboard to use. Keytronic makes an excellent cheap keyboard--I'd recommend checking them out."
1,First keyboard I've ever hated.,This keyboard feels flimsy and the power key location results in constant interferences with my attempts to use my computer.
2,Same old thing,"I bought the CD thinking that it would be a fun thing for my daughter to listen to in the car. The music is the same old thing you can get anywhere else for less money. It would be better if the voice was more kid-like, and the sounds less annoying.There is a good selection of song titles. My daughter knew almost all of them, so that is good."
2,insignificant in comparison to his first cook book,"This book was a dissapointment after his first book ""Eat This...It'll Make You Feel Better"". The sense of home, family, friends, and real down to earth Italian cooking was gone. How sad. The genuine Italian warmth and passion was missing. No bravos for this one!!!"
3,Not what I expected,"Although the book was in excellent condition and arrived in a timely manner, I was disappointed with the content. Who knew that Dom Delouise would go diet???? I loved his first book and was looking forward to this one being as filled with luscious recipes, but instead I found diet shortcuts and not very appetizing recipes. With the demise of this great man, I will never have more of his Mom's delicious recipes from the past. Too bad, too sad."
2,"Not soft, absorbs too much and doesn't give up any","I've been looking for the soft sponges you get in the makeup cases, and these are not it. These are rough and somewhat rubbery if you can imagine the cheap kind you get at the grocery store. It's great I guess if you cake stuff on, but it's not very practical.The sponge absorbs a lot of makeup in the little air holes but it does not spread or come off on my face at all. It might depend on what kind of foundation or concealer you are using, but just keep in mind that these are not soft, they're the sticky kind."
2,expensive crap,"This toy is ridiculously over priced!! Its beyond me why this cost $300. I found a similar item, same size and everything for 50 bucks. My advice to anyone that doesn't want to be ripped off is spend your 300 dollars on something else"
4,My daughter loves it,"My 7 year old daughter asked for this for christmas and loves it. My only complaint is that it only comes with 2 pets. You have to buy other pets separately, and the cost of these little plastic things start to really add up."
3,an okay toy,"For all the hype this toy got pre-xmas, I expected more from it. Additionally, there is a part of the toy that is supposed to spin around; that part did not work from the very beginning. I asked others who bought the toy; the spinning part on theirs worked, but not well."
5,LOOOOOVE IT!,Hi! Me and my Best Friends Forever LOVE! The Littlest Pet Shop collection we have soooo many I have 41! I take soooo much good care of mine so do my BFF'S we are DEFENTLIY getting this for Christmas or maybe even sooner !!!!
4,Too many twist ties and rubberbands! Still Cute though.,"My 3 1/2 year old daughter loves this toy. Just wanted to say that the packaging is amazing to say the least. It took me about 15 minutes to get everything ""free"" because there were so many rubberbands and twist ties. I actually bought one from Walmart and took it back because I thought it was broken (the center piece wouldn't turn around after I wound it up). When I got the second one home and it did the same thing, I turned it upside-down and saw a tiny rubberband I had missed. Silly me."
5,EXCELLENT,"I bought this for my little sister for Christmas and she absolutely LOVES it! It's a nice big size (not too big), perfect for a 6 year old who loves toys. It is by far her favorite Littlest Pet Shop Toy. I highly recommend this!"
4,item as expected,"Item as expected, the quantity is limited and good for small touch ups.be wary of the things you can do with this.Also make sure you check some videos to know how to apply the paint properly, so that the touch ups dont stand out from the rest of the car"
4,Color match was good and it was easy to use,"Used this to cover some rock chips. I should have taken my time, but the product was good.I would say go for it for smaller jobs"
1,Shocking,"I ordered 'Racing Pigeons' as a gift for my brother in Ireland on 10 October 2011. We're now on 17 November 2011 and there's no sign of it and no response from ""backpack_books"". A carrier pigeon would have made it to Ireland by now. Seems I've lost my money, since there's no response from the bookseller . . . Nice, Amazon."
3,"OK, but there are better","Years ago I owned one of these babies. It did what it supposed to do, clean out grungy aquariums.HOWEVER.. the plastic casing around the impeller often cracks, leading to leakage, a drained aquarium and a ruined floor. I don't care what Vortex says, repair of this housing is time consuming and frustrating and the repair job does not guarantee a perfect motor shaft/housing seal.Another poor feature of this filter is that it is not self-priming and the diatomacious earth is not self setting on the element bag, making this filter messy to set up. Also this filter was not designed for continuous operation.For my money, it is better to upgrade to a superior technology and buy the Marineland Magnum 350. It is everything the Vortex filter wants to be, it is self-priming and it can be both a diatom filter and a superior activated charcoal canister filter. And furthermore, the Magnum lasts for decades of trouble free operation."
5,Diatom filter,"I had anXL model for years.I needed a new small one for a small tank. Vortex is and has had a great reputation for many years. Your price was what caught my eye . Vortex was and is my only choice.Thanks,Buck"
5,A soul and life changing book.....,"I had this on my wish list for months. Finally I got it. I cannot praise this book high enough. If you are of the melancholy tempermant that I am sure you are being drawn to this book.It looks at melancholy with the complexity, awe and respect it deserves. Not as modern ""depression""...depression being something different and darker. The book mostly addresses melancholy as a way one sees the world...their worldview. How they are born...their fate.I got so much soul-affirming messages out of this gorgeous book, it made me feel that I am not ""odd"" or an outcast. I am just me and one a privileged few. The western mindset has always felt to me off...too fast, speedy, instant, positive and uncaring of the deeper aspects of life and the soul.The author writes with the most eloquent and lyrical prose, making this an absolute joy to read as well as a mind and idea altering book. Truely an accomplishment!"
1,Like a BAD series romance!,"Horrible. Sorry, but I can't believe that this is the same author who wrote Dove's Way! What happened? In this second attempt at contemporary fiction this book is so lacking. It reads like a bad series romance book.... Thoughout the book Vivi is supposed to be funny and small and fragile as we are reminded so many times throughout the book. She is also quirky and has bad fashion sense, ie. dresses like a hooker. Ditzy socialite and rags to riches tycoon. Bad story, bad plotting, unlikable characters. The worst. A total wastes of money and brain cells."
4,From princess to pauper...,"Vivienne is about to marry Grady, but discovers that he has eyes for someone a female attorney he works with, so they part amicably. She then discovers that her daddy has run off with her inheritance, leaving her to fend for herself, and stuck with all the bills.She suddenly finds herself without a home, car, credit cards, man, or prospects for a job. Real estate mogul Max accidentally offers her a job as a nanny for his two sisters, which she quickly accepts. Soon, Vivienne has wooed his entire family, including his surly teenage sister, Nicky.Vivienne has never really been in love; her relationship with Grady was based on societal concerns. Plus, she has never really known if men have liked her for herself or her fortune. Max has been nursing a crush on Vivienne since he was 10 and she was 6; will he finally get the chance to explore his feelings for her?Lee cleverly uses Vivienne's unused Wedding Diary for her personal revelations which aid the progression of the story."
2,The Wedding Diaries,"I really thought this was a dumb book. The plot wasn't too bad and the characters were well defined. I like romance and sex as well as anyone, butI really got tired of it and the whole absurd idea that they had every kind of sex imaginable, except for penetration. The sex scenes took over the book and became boring. This book reads like a Harlequin Romance and is about as interesting. I bought this for my Kindle and was so disappointed in it that I removed it from the Kindle and stored it. If I could remove it permanently I would."
5,Fabulous Machine,I bought this scanner based on the reviews alread on this page. They are absolutely correct.This scanner has proven to be everything it is supposed to be. I would recommend it to anyone.
4,A great scanner at a reasonable price,"This is a simple and elegant scanner, very easy to use with high resolution. It includes one film holder and one slide holder. If you need more, you can purchase it at store.alestron.usIt includes a professional grade software SilverFast, but most people don't need it at all. You can go by with simply QuickScan software included.Overall, it's a great scanner at a very reasonable price."
1,product needs work and support,"I purchased the scanner and set up the software. I scanned in three slides in TIF format and got 45-47 gig files. Intelli scan didn't work. Support for either the software or hardware is available in Germany and Taiwan only with only local phone numbers. After 3 days of screwing with it with no progress made, I returned it.Thank the Lord Amazon allows returns!"
4,35 mm film scanner,"The product did exactly what I would have hoped. No problem with the h/w.The s/w too worked as well as I might have expected, with this exception:It seems to have loaded some executables in the startup menu, or perhaps in the registry that cause the s/w to run whenever I attach any device to the USB port. This is a bit of a nuisance since I have to close the s/w each time. I'm still looking for a way to keep this from happening.Still...the scanner works well and I've converted quite a few 35 mm slides into .png files."
5,Tropical Sunset,"Beautiful picture! We were happy to find this. It arrived in a tube, no problems with shipping. Seems to be very good quality. Good value for the money. We are very pleased!"
1,"Horrible device, worse Oregon Scientific Customer Service","I purchased this weather radio for my parents, since they were new to Central Florida, and had just gone through the hurricanes of 2004. I thought it would help to put their minds at ease a little. Instead, we found that there was NEVER an alert (even through last year's hurricanes). Since the manual was a little tricky, I decided to e-mail the wonderful folks at Oregon Scientific to ask for assistance. Apparently they can't be bothered to respond to customers once they have money in pocket. Now, I realize that customer service is not what it once was, but I found this to be deplorable. I do not recommend this product to ANYONE, and more importantly, I will NEVER buy anything from Oregon Scientific again."
1,Stopped working after first power outage,"Not intuitive, have to use the book to figure out how to set it. It worked for the weekly test fine for several months and then stopped working. Battery backup is misleading, the duracells we put in must have charged and leaked while it was plugged in and we had to reset the thing numerous times. For the price this is pathetic. This is going in the trash and I won't be buying another product from Oregon Scientific again."
3,Worked but not alot of features,"The reception wasn't that good, and you can not turn off some of the lower alarms. Like thunderstorm warning and watches. So I returned it and got the Midland WR-300. I am happy with the WR-300 more features with battery backup."
1,typical Oregon Scientific - cryptic and non-intuitive,"If you can make it through the tiny, poorly organized, and often cryptic operating instruction booklet you may have a chance to put this to use, but then you may find like I did that it loses functions after several months of use in a very friendly environment. Why they can't make their controls intuitive and their instructions clear is beyond me, this seems to be a problem with all of the products I've used by this company. Expect frustration if you buy this. I'm buying something else."
1,Doesn't work!,"I have never had this radio operate as stated. I wanted it for early warning during bad weather at night. I cannot get any reception in my house with it. I downloaded the frequencies for my county as well as 2 other local counties for it to monitor from the NOAA website. It has missed every tornado and severe weather alert issued for my area. I have e-mailed Amazon and Oregon Scientific regarding this issue without response. Since it has been over 30 days, looks like I am stuck with this thing until I can go out locally to find something that works. I refuse waste my money on any more Oregon Scientific products."
4,Works well,This item was a gift to my son who lives in Indiana. It was put to good use recently when a tremendous storm hit the West Lafayette area and it worked as advertised. It's a little peace of mind. Thank you!
1,Weather Alert Monitor,"I consider myself fairly tech-savvy, but never could figure out how to program this to get local weather alerts. So it was a waste of money."
3,Decent portable unit,"Just so it's clear:- Has an earphone jack so you can plug in to external sound source.- Does not have an external antenna jack- Comes with AC adapterOverall reception is typical of what you would expect from such a small antenna (i.e. you better be living nearby NOAA's transmitter if you want good signal). Unit would have been better if it contained an external antenna jack for home use, as getting clear reception inside a dwelling can be especially problematic."
1,worth a 0 star rating. An absolute rip off,Gets' an F grade from me. Here's why:1. Extremely poor reception in every room in the house.2. Manual is way too complicated and setting the monitor is frustratingly difficult.3. After a power outage we had to reset it AGAIN.4. It never went off when there was a weather advisory so I do not see the point of this contraption.I thought by paying a little more for this one as opposed to other NOAA monitors offered on amazon that I would get a better device. Very dissapointed and will be throwing this one into the trash.
4,Evluation of WR103,"I own this unit for several months now and it's been working fine so far. My evaluation follows.1. Progamming of country codes requires a little experience, but not difficult.2. The unit so far has been working properly with clear reception, covering 3 neighboring counties.3. The two alarms work well although a pleasanter tone is desirable.4. Reliability of the unit connot be evaluated at this time."
2,OK Movies,"Older movies, but if you like gangster movies like I do, you might like this collection. Buy it used and save money, just in case you don't like it."
4,Natural History for the head and the heart,"Natural history writing is often like porridge. Sometimes it is too hot, and we see nothing but the author's passion for the place he/she is describing. Other times it is too cold, and the writing is merely a dull list of species descriptions and scientific concepts. Weidensaul's book strides that narrow middle ground of being just right. His chapters span the length of the Appalachians, covering topics as diverse as soil science and hawk migrations. However, he never becomes bogged down in dry scientific writing: his love of the Appalachians resonates throughout the book. In a country where most natural history writers turn their eyes west, Weidensaul's book is a much needed overview of an underappreciated mountain range."
3,Introductory-General Overview,"This book says it's intended for someone directing a student or amateur play, which it is. But McCaffery anticipates a rather large production company or theater group. He assumes there are actually separate persons as set designer, costume designer and ""production manager"" aside from the producer or director, which isn't true in most community theater groups, I've observed. (Using British-Irish terminology, he calls the producer the ""administrator"".The book does give some thoughtful ideas, but in general is too short, and gives a general overview of the process without too many specific tips. There are some interesting examples of worksheets used at different parts of the process.The glossary of theatrical terms wasn't as helpful as I hoped, because the British-Irish terms differ from American jargon more than I realized."
4,Mountain Biking Santa Cruz,"Good book about legal trails. I just wish it detailed the ""illegal"" ones better for us rebels looking for a little more adventure."
1,I don't recommend this book: Inaccurate/Poor Descriptions,"I live in Santa Cruz and bought this book to explore other trails that I haven't found yet. Though this book is fairly comprehensive, I have found some inaccuracies in the trail descriptions and portions of the book poorly document the trails and other important details. In addition, the writers of this book encourage riders to visit illegal trails and to disregard state law. There are other better quality books out there as well as many FREE websites that provide information on these same trails."
2,Pink girl's motorcycle,"I bought this for my 6 year old daughter. It is not for an older child. It moves very slowly and though she seems to like it, it's not anything like I thought it would be. I'm not saying it's a bad purchase, it's just not for an older child. It's better for 2-3 year olds. I only got it because it said ages 3 and up, but it's not for them."
1,Don't waste your money,"I was incredibly disappointed by this product. No new techniques, no new skill set, no new info, no new patterns. I feel it was a huge waste of time and money."
2,Don't believe all those 5 star reviews,"I believed all these excellent reviews, bought this camera and went on long trip. What a disappointment !! The flash was not bright enough beyond 10 feet. I tried to shot a brightly-lit concert without the flash, nothing but blur. Sorry Amazon, I am returning this piece of junk. Thanks to all those 5 star reviewers. You did a good job misleading me."
3,"good, basic, but dated","Nice, basic camera for a newbie or kid to get started with. These are no longer made, but there might still be some new ones & plenty of used ones floating around out there.I've updated this review in Dec. 2009 & the camera still works well.BEWARE: Uses obsolete SmartMedia memory cards, which are difficult to find (unless you order online). Yet for all these cards' obsolesence,their prices haven't come down.If you buy one, used or new, make sure its memory card contains at least 16 MB of memory. That should allow one to get about 50 pictures out of it when it's @ default settings.Disadvantages: no zoom function; steep learning curve if one has never used a digital camera before; must use rechargable batteries unless you want to spend a fortune on regular AA batteries; time it takes to green-light between shots is long -- not good if you're taking action shots."
4,Fine Camera,"This is a very fine camera. I wish it were a little cheaper, but it has lived up to the price in the image quality and softwear usability. It was the first USB camera that would work on my computer (a slighty older USB socket model). The photos are clear and sharp. You can zoom and, what is not mentioned, pan around the image on the camera via the very clear LCD monitor. It will take all the SmartCard media sizes (which was a problem with a previous digital camera I had. It only took one size). So image capacity is great. The compact size (and it is a small one) makes it real easy to tote and use (watch those fingers). Even for someone starting out in digital photography, you can't go wrong with this one. I do wish the ""movie"" feature could increase in time with the larger storage mediums, however. Thanks FujiFilm."
2,Bad Drivers,"This is a good camera, with a lot of good features for a reasonable price. However the Windows drivers are the worst I've ever seen. I could not get it to work with my Windows 2000 computer at all. I have it kind of working with my XP computer using their XP update but it reboots the computer often (yes reboots when I plug the camera in and turn it on my computer reboots). I have been dealing with these issues for two months now and no new drivers have come out."
1,That Camera is ......,I bought this camera in march and by day 2 while turning it broke.... I had a whole problem with it.I dont recommend it when you have children because its really flimsy..... DONT BUY IT.
5,GREAT NOSTALGIA,"WWE LEGENDS IS A GREAT READ FOR ALL FANS, BUT MOSTLY FOR FANS OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER THE 1960'S TO PRESENT DAY. MANY MANY PERFORMERS ARE COVERED IN A SHORT CHAPTER OF THEIR OWN. IT COVERS THE WRESTLER'S REAL NAME, A BIT OF BIOGRAPHY, TITLES HELD IF ANY, A BRIEF BUT DETAILED SUMMARY OF THEIR CAREER AND WHERE THEY ARE TODAY. (IF STILL LIVING) IT COVERS ANDRE, NATURE BOY, IRON SHEIK, SARGE AND MANY MANY MORE. IT BROUGHT BACK SOME GREAT MEMORIES WHEN AS A CHILD, I THOUGHT IT WAS ALL FOR REAL. I RECOMMEND THIS IF YOU WANT A GREAT READ FOR OLD TIME WRESTLING, WWE STYLE."
5,A nicely scripted coming-of-age novel about the youngest daughter a poor sharecropping family from rural Illinois,"Plenty Porter by Brandon Noonan is a nicely scripted coming-of-age novel about the youngest daughter a poor sharecropping family from rural Illinois. Plenty is the youngest of eleven children and has trouble ""fitting in"", all of which is further complicated with her meeting a boy named Ed who is the son of a rich landowner. The two of them begin a relationship that has Penny discovering the true meaning of family and an intimacy she had never before experienced. Documenting Brandon Noonan as a skillfully original novelist, Plenty Porter is very highly recommended reading for those who appreciate the combination of deft authorship and timeless values."
5,how angle peterson got his name,It tells you about Angle Peterson doing all this crazy stof like pulling a car.I like it when they bult a skatebord and race down the high way.
4,Pretty Good!,"This writer is actually very effective and fast. It is the fastest burner I have ever used! The only negative is the price! Very spendy many would say! However, overall it is very useful to computer ""pros""--those who have the need for speed!"
5,"Go-Betweens, Orange Juice, Costello fans should love this","Superb songwriting and playing. This is tremendous. It came out in '84 but hasn't dated at all to these ears. They didn't sound as great as this one future outtings. If possible, go for the import with the 5 extra tracks. Listen, love, cherish."
5,Exceptionnal & rare. Songs will follow you your life long.,"This is the best album by MICRODISNEY, far superior to anything they produced later (as FATIMA MANSIONS or HIGH LLAMAS, although both are themselves superior to 95% of average pop-rock. More than 10 years later the album melodies and lyrics regularly surface in the back of your mind. Exceptionnal & Rare !"
3,Mostly Irrelevant Information,"I read this after being accepted into Northwestern. It didn't quite give me an idea of what Northwestern is like; few of the opinions in it are particularly insightful or revealing. Most of them are vague, general statements about narrow subjects to which I felt only indifference. It also seems that, in an attempt to show some sort of balance or contrast, some views are given more credence than they are actually owed. Overall, after reading it, you might get the feeling that you didn't actually retain most of the information it gave you. A better source of information would be any human connection you have with Northwestern. If you don't have a friend at Northwestern, join a Facebook group and start asking questions; the current students are more than happy to answer, and their answers are usually more in depth and reflective of your true questions. Nevertheless, this book makes a thoughtful gift to anyone who will soon attend Northwestern."
2,Grizzly H3278 nail and fastener bag,"I bought 2 of these, one the insides were not sown totally together so you couldn't seperate your nail sizes. I wouldn't tell anyone to buy this product. You get what you pay for David Baggett"
1,HOF JUNK JUNK JUNK,"HUNK OF F$$$screws DO NOT STAY seperated. do not buy, you will ruin that counter top when a two inch screw winds up in the 1 inch section. JUNK JUNK JUNK!"
4,Sort and carry,"I like the idea of having all the sizes of screws or nails for a job in one bag. I store them in a five gallon buckets so I just grab the ""deck"" pail and go do a deck no moving boxes or bags their in the bag. I put three and a half inch in for structure in one section and inch and three quarters for the deck in three pockets and have room for the drivers to put them in. And when you tie the top no spills or leakage. Just a bright idea."
3,Works,It is a nail bag. It holds nails and it fits in a bucket. Not a lot more you can say about it.
5,Amazing House-Hold Invention Saves The Day!,"I had a party for my 4 year old's birthday and this came in very handy! I moved all the supply's for 50 people including tables, chairs, and food. It make my life 10 times easier and saved my back from any strain at all! This must be the most useful product that has come out in years!"
1,Not what it promised,"This item does everything it promises - except the one thing I bought it for, to be a hand truck with the arm in the upright position as the picture in this ad clearly shows. Instead of a 90 position, the arm reclines at about 135. Might work fine if you need a cart to pull items that will balance themselves on the flat bed, but I need a hand truck to transport broken down packing boxes. With the arm slanted rather than upright, the boxes just slide off.I contacted the seller to see if I was misunderstanding the instructions. I was not. When I said that it would not work as advertised and therefore I needed to return it, I was told I would have to repack it in the original packing (which I don't have) and pay the shipping costs of the return (29 pounds and a very big box). So here I am with a trolley that does not perform as advertised, and that I'll probably have to try to sell on craigslist and eat the loss."
4,total trolley,great for moving items of all sizes. not ideal for rough surfaces like outoors with a lot of gravel. the ladder feature is very handy. it saves a lot of extra trips to the truck.
4,Great CD,This a cool cd the keyboard player is spectacular just the sound of it is so rich and deep. Gerard plays rich deep Flugal Horn that vibes thru your body.All in All if you are a avid jazz fan get this for your collection.
4,A good book to learn Feynman diagrams,"A reader can learn how to compute the Green's functions and the scattering amplitudes using Feynman diagrams. The scalar Klein-Gordon field is used as a pedagogical example at the beginning. The philosophy of the path integral is used all over the book. However, the book does not emphasize the philosophy of the Wilson renormalization group and in this sense the primer is not modern. Nevertheless, Pierre Ramond is a pretty famous scientist and you can learn many things from this book."
1,I was really looking for the English translation of this book,Because I do not understand Spanish...I was really hoping to find the English Translation of this book...so I am a bit disappointed with this.
1,It's really small for the $,"Despite how it looks in the picture, this kiss will fit in the palm of your hand. I definitely expected it to be bigger based on the twelve dollar price tag. I was really disappointed. Shame on me for not looking up how big seven ounces is, but this has to be the worst value on amazon."
4,cute shoes,"The are a cute shoe and go with everything. They were a bit snug, so I would recommend getting a half size larger."
5,"Great Workout, Great value","I purchased this boxed set thinking that it was a great value to get 4 of Shiva Rea's CDs for under $30! I decided to try the Trance Dance album, not sure what I was getting into. I was pleasantly surprised to find that she has integrated Yoga and Dance into one practice! The other CD on this album is just great music--for Yoga or just about anyting.As mentioned in the other reviews the Yoga Chant album is very similar to her Yoga Sanctuary workout. I would recommend that beginners to yoga try the second CD first and become comfortable with the sun salutations--the chanting is great also, truly opens the heart. The first CD on this album is a challenge, even for an Ashtanga teacher like myself with some intense balancing poses and backbends--but, I am getting better at them! Overall well worth buying."
4,Private yoga class,"These audio yoga CDs are great if you are familiar with yoga poses and prefer a guided practice, but don't feel inclined to leave the house. Just put in the cd, close your eyes, breathe, and get lost in the calming practice. I would like some of the tracks to be longer (with more repetions) but you can repeat a track.It also allows you to easily customize your practice by selecting only the postures you enjoy or have time for."
5,Very handy size quality dip bowl,"For some two years I have been collecting Villeroy & Boch dinnerware and I have yet to be disappointed with this high quality German/Luxemburg line. The distinctive style is what you notice first, but the quality is what keeps you coming back for more. I recommend you start somewhere from amongst their extensive line and see how much you enjoy these and what interested comments you receive from your friends. Then start collecting!"
2,new wave individual bowls.,"the bowls are pretty, but too small to be of any real use other than for dipping sauce.if this is what you need, a shallow, smallish bowl, this is the item for you, however if you want to use it for soup or cereal, go for either the cream soup or the square rim bowl."
2,Enough with the Scottish brogue already,"Amanda is a ""classy"" Reno showgirl who has been targeted by the ""Showgirl Slayer"" who has already killed several area showgirls. Tristan MacLaughlin - a Scottish transplant to Seattle is sent to Reno to head a task force to find the killer, and although they constantly clash, he eventually has eyes for Amanda, despite his misgivings about her career choice. Will he find the killer in time to save the lass he has come to love?One of Andersen's earlier romantic suspense novels, it is actually not that great. It took forever for the romance to emerge, and frankly the character of Tristan and his Scottish brogue are so annoying that he grates on your nerves. It was a chore to finish this story. Her later comic romances are so much better, but she does have a cache of great romantic suspense novels (such as ""Obsession""), this just isn't one of them."
1,Just Too Dull,"I liked the fact that romance was blended with mystery, or ""thriller"" as this book was classified, and that part was fine, but honestly, I struggled to finish this book, it was that dull. And with the way Tristan was described, I could never get a handle on who this guy was or what he was supposed to look like. I never got the feeling he was anything more than an old beef-cake with little brain. I just couldn't picture him as a handsome guy with a nice body. In my opinion, the author failed to convey this to the reader."
2,This book was so boring....,I have really liked most of Susan Andersen's books but this is not one of them. It was hard for me to even finish this book it was so dull...
3,"It was okay, but not great","I bought this book last night and was very excited to read it, as I have enjoyed every Susan Andersen book I have read thus far. Well, this one was a bit of a disappointment. I felt the story was not developed well enought. There was really not much background information on Tristan besides the fact that he grew up in an orphanage. I felt the relationship between Tristan and Amanda was real abrupt and did not flow in the normal way of this author's usual books.Overall, I am not going to say that I did not enjoy the story, but most likely I will not be re-reading it in the future."
2,"Parts were okay, but was SO boring","There were so many boring sections in this book I almost put it down, but the few interesting scenes kept me from doing so. It had a lot of potential and I thought Amanda was a great girl, very lovely and sweet, but Tristan was a different story. I found it hard to get to know this guy."
1,Dance of dullness,"Once again Susan Andersen's inconsistancy shines. In this novel, which sounds tantalizing on the back cover, Andersen bogs down what could be an exciting novel in paragraph after paragraph of useless information. Where's the dialogue? Where's the snappy, sassy interplay between her characters? Try finding it in ""Baby, I'm Yours."" It's unfortunate that her publishers aren't interested in putting her best foot forward, ""Shadow Dance"" leaves much to be desired and only takes away from Andersen's reputation as an exciting story teller.Avoid at all costs."
2,Some things are better left unpublished,"My pet peeve is when an author becomes successful and the publishing company releases all of their early attempts at writing. They do this hoping to ride the wave of popularity of the author, but some things are better left unpublished! I also wish that these books were not advertised as ""new releases"". I have been disappointed several times when I ordered a book online, only to discover when it arrived that it was something written by the author 20 years ago and then re-released. These stories tend to be outdated and some of the dialogue is laughable!"
4,Beware the oliphant,"I agree with the previous (and, at this point, only other) review of this product in that the Song of Roland is (sadly) an often overlooked piece of medieval literature. I have taken several classes on the topic and I had never even heard of the poem until it was reccommended to me by my brother. After reading it, I too urge anyone interested in this style of literature to pick it up. It's a quick and easy read, yet for all that it embodies all the ideals and heroic qualities of France (and much of Christian western Europe) during the 8th and 9th centuries (and probably beyond as well). The Song of Roland exists as one of the dominant and most influential pieces of the period, and should not be neglected by any student of the era. Plus, you have to love a hero that is such a beast in battle that his death is not a result of any fighting wounds, but rather just a mighty blast of his own."
1,too much information,"A reviewer lauded the fact that this book let you get to know Susan McElroy better. Why would one want to? She is spiritually and professionally connected to animals, yet eats them and gives them away when they become inconvenient details in her search for whatever it is that she is searching for. She moves from places she loves to find some more comforting, but elusive home ground. She gently dumps her husband and vows to remain a solitary womanspirit, only to have a new lover within three months. And who wants to read all their ""soul mate"" emails during their typically giddy courtship period. Not me...."
1,Useless,"This KVM switch is a complete waste of time. It drops mouse clicks and keystrokes for either computer connected to it. I can't express in mere words how utterly annoying this is. It also has problems keeping your keyboard and mouse in a working state, locks up, and sometimes requires reboots of one or both computers. So while the V part functions, the K and the M plain don't work. I have seen many other similar complaints, so you would be well-advised to stay away from this plastic simpleton (unless your hobby is making returns and paying restocking fees)."
2,Mouse and Keyboard do not function well,"The KVM switch DKVM-2U does not work properly with my hardware as follows:Hardware: Microsoft Comfort Curve Keyboard 2000Symptoms:1) From each five to ten words typed, around one key stroke is missed.2) Keyboard unexpectedly loses connection (requires unplug/replug or shift between machines to recover connection).3) Keyboard unexpectedly locks with a key strokeeeeeeeeeeeeeee oops like just happened here, and requires unplug/replug or shift between machines to recover connection.4) Function keys do not work (volume, mute, home, email, etc... all of them)Hardware: Microsoft Standard Wireless Optical MouseSymptoms: Completely non-operatinalHardware: Dell optical wired mouse M-UVDEL1Symptoms: Around 30% of mouse clicks are missedThe only working item is the video.Running WIN XP SP2 on both machines.I am dissatisfied and do not recommend the product. It is a pitty it doesn't work."
1,Junk,"Don't waste your money in this. It didn't work well even with a standard keyboard. It missed your keypress all the time and sometime it stupidly repeated receiving the same keypress many many times. e.g., you try to delete one letter by pressing Backspace but it kills several line of your text. The switch died all the time and you needed to reactivate it by pressing the button on the panel.I don't understand why this thing can be sold as a product. Just a piece of junk."
4,Not what is pictured,The belt I received does not have the metal grommets as pictured.But it seems to be a decent belt for the money.It is a little flimsy so I sprayed it down with clear acrylic and that stiffened it right up.
5,Top of the line!,"I can not tell you how splendid this work is, I just am flabergasted! Some books are written and then some books are ""written""! This book was ""written""! Hands down I have to tell you this was a book that was ""written"" !I am a professional critic so I have a few gripes. One the binding bent to easily when I threw the book against the wall. OK, so I have a problem with big words, the book uses big words when little words would suffice. Call me crazy but do not call me if you plan to read this p...I am told I will love the book and given time (and some time on the rack) I suppose I would, but at this point I will have to reserve judgement until I read the dang thang. Please do not hold your breath....Best book I have ever...Go read now!"
1,Doesn't fit Anolon lids,"I bought a lot of Anolon pans amd thought this would be nice for lids. Only thing, they don't fit. Handles are too high to go into dividers. 20 dollars in the trash."
1,too small,"I am 5'7"" and wear a size 6, so I am a pretty average/slim sized girl, but these tights were way to small. I had to cut the toes off to be able to pull these all the way up.If you are any bigger then me you probably won't be able to fit in them."
2,"Small, even for little people","I think these tights are meant for kids because they didn't quite fit me. I'm 5'2"" and 93 lbs with slim legs but these tights didn't pull all the way up. Look for the size before purchasing for future reference. ""One-size"" doesn't suffice, apparently."
3,Nice and soft...loosen up quickly,"I love these tights. very comfortable, arrived on time and in good condition. They do loosen up a little bit and tend to crease up in areas. The feet are a little big for my feet. I wear a size 5-6. Overall, I love em...Update...I will never review an item without wearing it an entire day, honest. These look good but I was pulling them up ALL day and it started pretty quickly."
2,Royal Blue thights,"The color was completly wrong, instead of Royal Blue they should call it Electric Blue. The blue is extremely bright!!!!!"
1,"Not much stretch, and easily tear","The color was great, and for a Halloween costume (aka, only one night) they did their job. But they don't stretch as much as I expected, and they tear easily. Due to the lack of stretch, I put a run in them the first time I was putting them on (and no, I'm not too big. 5'5"", 120 lbs). So it's definitely not one size fits all."
1,Too Small,these tights did not even go all the way up my leg. Im only 5'3 (not a tall person at all). The color was right on with what I wanted but the size was not. They were deliver to me quickly tho.
5,Michas Hits All The Nails On The Head,"As a Greek-American who has been puzzled and sometimes appalled at some of the policies and anti-Americanism flowing out of our brethern in Greece over the last decade or more, Michas's effort at documenting and analyzing what has defined Greece, and her often self-defeating and irrational policies, is a welcome attempt at getting a great deal out in the open and identifying some of the root causes. The disconnect between the ancient cradle of Democracy and the the rest of the Western World is quite a story and Michas, who we understand is a Greek citizen living and working in Athens, has done a very brave job of presenting it. Congratulations Mr. Michas!It will be interesting to see how this book is received in Greece when it is published in the Greek language later this year."
1,It should be Zero-star,What a total waste of paper! The author claims to be a responsible journalist but on the evidence of this book I have serious concerns about his motives as well as sources. A pretender...
1,SHAME & DISGRACE...!!!,"...are the only two words that I can use to discribe this book.The americano-greek authors,or what is little left of greek in them,are a perfect example of ""a la Robert D.Kaplan"" followers and are an obvious result of disillusionement,disinformation,lies and alltogether fabricated facts created by western media which is involved in daily brainwashing of the citizens of the western world.And as for how will this book be viewed in Greece?Well...not very well...if it is indeed ever allowed to be published there.Why?Well...because garbage like this one is a shame & disgrace towards the greek people,their christian-orthodox culture and everything it stands for."
4,Great condition,"The book was in great condition. I bought it for a class and I didn't want to spend a lot of money because I will probably resell it, so for the price and the quality I was very pleased."
5,Fluke banana plug terminated patch cable,"I have made many lab test cables from wire and banana plugs. But sometimes it is not worth the fuss to make another set. This Fluke set is strong and offers a piggyback banana jack that my own cables do not have. Hard to say too much about a cable, suffice to say that I highly recommend this set."
2,Latin Dancing for Beginners by Teresa Mason,"I could not see the guy well because of the black costume. I kept falling down. I got up but fell again. And then, there was this smell, I don't know were it came from."
2,DON'T BUY THIS VIDEO/DVD,"I was very disappointed with this instructional video. The background is pitch black and the male dancer wears black pants and shoes, so you can barely see what he is doing from the waist down, which is very important to see in order to learn. (Whole point of the video, no?) Each step is only done once or twice, so you'd have to rewind over and over until you get it. Don't buy it! It's a waste of money."
2,There are better instructional videos out there,"The steps are too flowery (you'd be embarrassed doing some of their moves on the dance floor), the flow is too fast (you have to keep rewinding), the sequences are not broken down, the production is bad (as you have read, the man wears black against a black background and black floor--impossible to see). The Webb series is much better on all aspects, if you don't mind the out-dated attire."
1,Black Clothing,"Black clothing in front of a black screen, what are they thinking?? This goes way too fast and is impossible to follow."
2,One foot in the grave,"Specifically regarding the Alpha DVD. The source print was a worn 16mm dupe which is soft and has some missing frames plus a few audio dropouts. It certainly is viewable but better on a small television than a large High Def screen. The soundtrack is adequate with minor distortion. Overall, slightly above average for Alpha.The film's storyline is pedestrian as is Ray Corrigan. This is standard, low-budget westen fare made during the height of World War II. Obviously, not everyone was rushing off to war, as the Range Busters series was cranked out throughout WW2.Although this is available on Amazon for less than $3.50 with shipping, it is not worth the price. If you can find it a yard sale or swap meet for a dollar, then buy it."
1,Isn't It a Pity...,"...that this work falls far short of readers' expectations?In reading this book, one gets the feeling that the author is trying to curry George Harrison's favor. Instead of focussing on the former Beatle's achievements and accomplishments, it appears that this author is criticizing and scorning other artists such as Eric Clapton.The irony of it all is that Clayson has written a biography that was of extraordinary caliber on George Harrison, the 1/4 of the box set. This work, on the other hand is a real bust."
1,take it to the shredder !!,"Get your facts right, Mr. Biographer. Ravi Shankar is an INDIAN legend and sitar virtuouso; and not Bangladeshi as the author seems to believe (he notes this again in his brief interview with BBC, upon George Harrison's passing).Makes you wonder how much else is accurate in the book !"

Ravi Shankar is an INDIAN legend and sitar virtuouso; and not Bangladeshi as the author seems to believe (he notes this again in his brief interview with BBC, upon George Harrison's passing).Makes you wonder how much else is accurate in the book !Not worth a dime."
1,Worst purchase ever,"Nothing about this inverter works as it should, the fan runs constantly if on and it pulls over 20 amps, I could cool the car engine with 20 amps, The unit overheats and shuts off, after 5 minutes, with something as simple as a cellphone charger. And I've tried 3 different cellphones, JUNK"
1,makes a good paper weight,"I bought this product to power my son's playstation while on long trips. After two hours the inverter shut down. I check the fuses on the inverter and they were good. It blew the vehicle's fuses. I bypassed the fuse box and hooked the inverter directly up to the main battery. The unit quickly blew the 30A fuse on the case. The case has a an internal short. This thing is a waste of money. When this product failed with on 4 hours of use, I highly recommend that you find another product. THis thing is JUNK."
2,Little learning,"I bought this DVD for my 11 month old. The only good thing about it is that it keeps my son's attention. I hoped that there will be a lot of learning lessons. Unfortunately, there were very few things that would stimulate learning. This video is basically a showcase of many different toys."
4,Real help,"The book overall is very wordy and repetive in most of the dialogue. It starts out incredibly slow, but you learn alot of wisdom and you learn about yourself on a level that is so deep. Its all new therapy that works. I'm a mental health professional for the last 17 years and I've never ran across anything that helps relationship and understanding how to really live wholesome with others. My hobby is reading self help books. I tell you read this book on vacation like I did, this way your soul is open and you're not caught in the life rut. The last 4 pages and exercises were the greatest of all."
1,flaky and misleading!,Like others I was mislead into believing this book contained Christian/biblical content; what I got was gibberish that was so insanely flaky that I couldn't get past the first few chapters!Useless info and a waste of ink and paper.
4,One of the better books,Purchased this book for my daughter after seeing the author on Oprah. Kathy Freston does a good job identifying what you first need to look at in yourself prior to looking for a mate. Fast and easy read with good examples of love relationships.The book The Five Love Languages by Gary Chapman is an excellent choice for this genre and if you can only purchase one book I'd recommend the Chapman book over The One; Discovering the Secrets of Soul Mate Love.
5,Simply AWESOME,"I was intrigued to hear what interpretation of ""soul mate"" love would be. To my surprise, it spoke about me as The ONE and the quest for individual fulfillment in spiritual connection."
4,Good thoughts,"This will be the third book I can promote willingly. See all my reviews for the other three. Get this book and Stan Cronin's ""How to Date Your Wife"" and the other two books I suggest and practice the things spoken of in each book and you will have the makings of a great life with your spouse. I can't put it any simpler than that."
1,the one,"I think this book is awful. Hard read and way too much about finding the 'spirit'. If I needed that kind of read-can go to synagoue to find the same damn stuff.kathy Freston needs to get a life and do something other than write books.She is by no mean a ""relationship"" expert.I also received ""The Manual."" Great book and gives you insight of how a man really thinks."
1,JUNK!!!!,"Absolutely pathetic embroidery, pathetic. Shaggy threads ALL around the NY Logo. Wouldn't buy from this vendor, EVER again."
2,Original Scent of a Woman,"A rather stilted ungainly original version of Scent of a Woman. It was not all that enjoyable but I stayed with it and it did have its moments. The main character was made to look like a dirty old man which was quite unsavoury and ruined it a bit for me. I am keen on the remake (even though it is mainly a vehicle for Al Pacino), but it was good to see the original, warts and all. The Italian setting and scenery was great to see."
3,"Broad, unfocused beam","Be aware that this flashlight has a rather broad, largely unfocused beam, unlike conventional flashlights. This is because there is an array of forward-pointing LEDs which cannot all be located at the reflector focal point (and which aren't pointing back into the reflector anyway). Although I was surprised by the broad, diffused beam, I am still satisfied with the well-built light."
1,Never recieved Item!!!,"I Ordered this Flashlight on December 10, 2005. I thought I was early enough to recieve it by Christmas. Did not recieve it by the scheduled Dec. 15. So I wrote the company twice and they never returned my emails. I finally had to dispute the purchase with Amazon and they refuned my money."
1,Oil Rubbed Bronze Pretender,"Don't buy it if you are looking for true oil rubbed bronze (i.e., black over bronze). It's basically all bronze with hints of black. I returned it. Not at all like the photo. Very disappointed. Funny thing is that I bought tub spout from same supplier and it was perfect."
5,Simple but effective,"This came on time, had all the parts, and worked with the parts it was supposed to work with. It wasn't difficult to install and is so far holding up well."
2,Danze Shower Arm not true Rubbed Bronze,We purchased this item to go with other items from Danze that would make a complete tub transformation to Oil Rubbed Bronze only to find that this item and the shower head are not a true Oil Rubbed Bronze. They look more like a oil rubbed gold collor. We decided to not use them and they now sit in our basement. The image is deceiving. Not happy with the purchase.
2,"Nice Shirt, if you're a young kid","Do not take the title of this product literally...it should really say GIRLS Babydoll T-Shirt. I ordered this shirt a while back, for a 14 year old girl...she is in between girls sizes and junior sizes. I ordered a medium, thinking this would be plenty big for her, her being skinny...boy was I wrong! The size that came was definitely meant for children. I haven't even seen anorexic women this small. The t-shirt seemed of good quality though, and the picture printed on with good detail."
3,works but sucks to hookup,"sureflow has this clamp on system. Be ready to fight with it . if it doesnt snap on the first time be prepared to fight. i recomend hawk billed pliers. i had to call sure flow to repalce clamps- thats thiose humps you see in picture- which they did for free. But grr. they were pain, i would have been happy with standard threds. as far as it being a filter it works."
5,Required reading for the serious Blackberry grower!,I found the information in this book essential to producing thebest Blackberries.
4,Good but not for every day!,"I was looking for a healthy cookbook I could use every day. This one is not it. The recipes are good, but the recipes are ones I will not be using for weeknight cooking."
4,"a bit inconsistent, but definitely worth it","My wife and I have used this as one of our four basic cookbooks for the last three years. The pictures are lovely and the introductory material is good reading. There are perhaps two dozen recipes in here that have become staples for us, including all three muffin recipes, the waffles, the kale-bean soup, a citrus salmon salad, and a couple of the simpler pastas.On the down-side, perhaps a third of the dishes are quite complex, and several of the more complicated recipes we've tried have not been successes. This does dampen our enthusiasm for trying new pages. The ingredients are also often not easy to get (and we're in New York, so this isn't usually a problem) and the book doesn't usually suggest substitutes.On the upside, the recipes really are very healthy and often clever in finding ways of making usually fatty foods both delicious and healthy. The muffin recipes and the desserts in general are standouts here."
5,Fab!,"These recipes are great! There are a lot of tips for healthy eating in here as well, which i enjoyed reading. I love that each and every recipe has a picture as well! It gives me confidence to see that my meal looks like the picture of the book!"
5,Fantastic!,"Williams Sonoma hits the nail on the head when it comes to providing recipes for healthy living, and ones that actually taste good. Thank you!"
2,Nothing yummy yet,"Have cooked at least four recipes from this book (saffron fish stew, salmon and lentils, veggie lasagna, kale-bean soup, and I think one other), and not a single one has been good. Everything we've made so far has just been really bland and often starchy. We've found ourselves forcing ourselves to finish the recipes out of a sense of duty or a desire not to waste food.Buy this book if you want to reinforce the stereotype that there's a conflict between health and pleasure.On the plus side, it has beautiful pictures, and the opening sections have good basic advice on how to cook healthy."
5,detailed early standard bred horse race history,This wonderful hardbound book details the early history of organized American trotting horse (standard bred) racing. It also features numerous vintage illustrations of trotters from the 1820-1900. Truly a unique history/reference book for the serious standard bred historian and/or racing enthusiast.
4,"Revising the ""One Size Fits All"" Model of Rehabilitation","Employment of those with severe mental illnesses remains one of the most challenging areas of vocational rehabilitation. Shafer et al. address the issues, attitudes, and stigmas faced by this population in a concise and well-constructed guide. Instead of an idealized and theoretical approach, these authors confront the realities of mental illnesses as they manifest in the workplace and suggest alternatives that are supported by empirical evidence. Their review of existing literature is thorough, and consideration of every aspect of the rehabilitation process makes for a comprehensive design model. This book will be useful to anyone vested in improving the quality of life for those with chronic mental illness. The best thing that can be said, however, is that it conveys hope to those who suffer these devastating conditions."
3,a sleeper not a keeper,I found this book extremely cumbersome to read. His main argument presupposes a level of literacy in ancient Israel that i do not think history supports. A very expensive book that is not worth even half the price.
5,A welcome relief from the usual...,"One of the only books I've read on this subject that seems to come from a real, grounded, truthful place. There is no new-age dogma here, only insights that lead to a place that is already within our grasp, right now. A poetic, meaningful read that transcends any how-to technique, Catherine simply describes what we know to be true in our hearts, yet have never seen so plainly. I recommend this book to everyone....the clarity and truth of her words are very moving and profound, yet so simple."
3,Didn't Quite Get It Yet,"I really don't want to influence anyone yet because I am going to give this another chance in another book or venue. However, so far I just don't see it. I understand some of the perceptual possibilities and opportunities for growth of self. However, how these might facilitate relationships with others or improve communication between those that are beloved to one escape me so far. I do get that just generally self knowledge does this. Maybe I am just too literal or missed the idea entirely."
5,Prelude To Future,"Anyone who listen to this album, will ask how many months has this work. If you look, it says... 1994. One of the most revolutionairy albuns of the decade in my restrict list. Between electricity, sinusoidal waves, vocals and distorcions, lies the quietness and beauty of these CD tracks. The inumerous instruments used, show a bit of the complexity of this (unfortunately) extintct band."
4,Early history of the polio vaccine development effort by the March of Dimes,"Early ""history"" of the polio vaccine development effort of Jonas Salk and colleagues, supported by the March of Dimes (known then as the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis). Represents a compilation and expansion of stories from a metropolitan newspaper at the time -- not written by a historian or scientist. Provides details and anecdotes not found in other contemporaneous accounts and more academic recent histories."
5,Brilliant,"Marion Woodman is amazing. She talks about a global conscious femininity that everyone can relate to. For those who are struggling with their feminine creature, due to their social upbringing and our society today, this is a MUST read."
2,Warning: better Ayler available,"Don't buy this expecting it to be full of raw power and exciting improvising.I know lots of people love this album: I find much of it very simple and uninventive - much of Ayler's improvising has a plodding predictable feel and it's especially lacking in rhythmic interest.However AT TIMES it really comes alive such as in the second variation of Ghosts - even though I feel embarrassed every time I hear the boring and irritating unadorned theme.For a much tastier and more consistently interesting set I would heartily recommendVibrations, which has the same band except for the welcome addition of Don Cherry and of which ace reviewer Michael Stack says: Curious parties on Ayler should start here."
5,Great Ear Phones,These Ear Phones fit perfectly into my ears and have much better sound quality than most cheap earbuds. The volume control on the wire is very handy. These definitely get a 5 star rating.
4,almost the best,"The sound quality is excellent, the volume control convenient and the fit in the ear is comfortable and secure. But for the price it should have thicker insulation to protect the wiring. With such thin insulation, the delicate wires are likely to break just as quickly as those on cheaper ear phones."
3,good deal if fit is right,"I love the inline volume control, and the sound could be great. But as mentioned by one previous viewer, I also had put pressure on them in order to achieve that. Apart from that, they're not particularly comfortable. Also, I think the wiring is fairly fragile."
3,Sounds good if the fit is right.,"These Earhuggers were an immediate disappointment to me because to be able to listen to the full range of sound they pump out, I had to press them into my ears with my fingers and hold them there. Otherwise, the sound lacked any kind of definition. Since the pieces that go into the ears are made of hard plastic, the fit is not adjustable, so if it's not right, you're not going to enjoy this set. I still gave it 3 stars for the sound they are capable of reproducing. Now I've got Sony MDR-EX51LPs that come with 3 different sizes of soft rubber tips for a more custom fit. I am much happier with those."
3,A mixed bag,"This book is not what the title and cover suggested it would be. It is essentially a series of historical sketches of indigenous people of Siberia and how the Russians and Soviets exploited them. Shamanism is merely an occasional sidelight. Having said that, the book is well-written and insightful. It simply has very little to do with Shamanism."
2,The Truth Cookie,I thought this book was okay. Its about a girl who trys to get rid of her step mom and step brother by using cookies. This story had an awesome begining but a bad ending. I would not reccomend this book.
5,Great Music,"I loved Huey, Live at 25. It really brought me back to ""my old days"". Good vibe and feel good music, Huey is the best!"
1,Get yourself the DVD instead,"This long-overdue LIVE CD is just not worth the money. They should have released one way earlier when they were still big. Get yourself the DVD of Live@25 instead - it's much much better and represents the band where it stands now: they have made enough bucks and just wanna have fun! Nice gig, excellent production, excellent picture."
2,here's the real news,"Save your money, the group that backed Heuy Lewis in his hey day isn't here. Also Huey Lewis is out of tune. save you money & buy a greatest hits package you'd be much better off. Me I'm stuck with this."
4,A Fun and Enjoyable Trip Down Memory Lane,"If you like Huey Lewis, don't hesitate to pick up this disc. It has a nice mixture of hits from the 80s, 90s, and today. You can tell the upper end of Huey's voice has suffered a little bit with age. But otherwise he and his (now) larger band sound great. I especially enjoyed the new arrangement of ""Do You Believe in Love."" As somebody who grew up during the 80s (when Huey was at his peak), this disc has been a real treat to listen to."
5,Simply unbelievable! Unputdownable!,"This book changed my life! I could not put it down. Every time I read it (and I have read it at least five times) I pick something new out of it. Not your everyday book on Moufang polygons, that is for sure. Buy it now!"
2,Brain Candy,"This novel was definitely neither intellectually nor literarily challenging. It was, however, good brain candy for a quick summer read. The characters were frustrating, but funny and real, and the funeral scene was so bizarre I didn't know whether to laugh or cry."
3,Who's Sittin on the front Pew,"Sittin' in the Front Pew let us inside the lives, of four of the Naylor sisters planning the funeral of their much loved dad.How can a man so loved be afraid to share such a secret with his family? Especially when this happened so long ago.Can you imagine a person going to his grave and not telling the people he loved the most something so important .Then when the mystery person shows up and is allowed to sit on the front row one of the sisters refuses to attend.Collette later decide to come and all hell breaks loose when she steps in the church dressed the way she was.While I did not find much humor in this story I did feel a lot of the emotions shared. It allowed me to go behind the scenes and actually see what can happen to a family after losing a loved one.Having read this story I'll give it 3.5 stars ."
2,Predictable,"I found this book to be so predictable. It was an okay read; however, some parts were just too unbelieveable. For instance, the fight in the church, and Anthony coming from out of nowhere. If the father was all that, why did he keep such a big secret for so long? It wasnt that bad of thing to where he could'nt have told his family. His mother had already died years before. And everyone knew who Nina was from the start. More thought could have been put in introducing her. Not the worst book i've read, but I've read better."
5,Good Book,"I thought this was a very well written story. It was funny and sad at the same time. I really enjoyed reading it. You should try her other book ""Shirt Off His Back"" that was really good also."
4,Family Drama!!!,"A look at family at the worst of times!! I thought it was a good book, I enjoyed reading it."
5,A READER FOR LIFE,Outstanding! This is a must read. It's full of emotion and the characters really come to life.
2,Trite,"This was my first book read by this author. The book was good, however, I do not feel it was a ""5"" by any stretch of the imagination. I felt the book was a little slow paced in parts, and was very, and I do mean VERY predictable. There have been too many other similar stories written by other black authors, on this same topic; which is families falling apart and acting out at funerals. I give this one a ""2"""
1,"I""M SORRY, BUT THIS STORY [is awful!]","THIS IS THE MOST BORING BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. ONLY REASON WHY I'M READING THIS IS BECAUSE I HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO READ. PARRY, GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD ON THIS ONE, CAUSE IT'S VERY BAD. I DIDN'T LIKE THE CHARACTERS IN THIS BOOK, ESPECIALLY THE SISTERS, AND I FEEL LIKE SLAPPING ALL OF THEM TOO. THEY ACT LIKE SPOILED BRATS! AND THESE ARE SUPPOSE TO BE ""STRONG BLACK SISTAS?"" THE SISTAS I KNOW DON'T ACT LIKE THIS. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYBODY TO READ AND THE PLOT WAS VERY SLOW AND BORING, TOO DETAILED IN PLANNING A FUNERAL. WE DID NOT NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ""FONTS USED FOR THE PROGRAM AND FLOWERS AND COLORS FOR THE CASET, AND WHAT COLORS WAS THE SISTERS GOING TO WEAR"". ALL THAT WAS VERY TRIVIAL. MS BROWN, START AGAIN, PLEASE. AND THIS TIME, GET TO THE POINT OF THE PLOT, DON'T MAKE IT SO DRAWN OUT THAT THE READER GETS TIRED OF READING IT."
3,This story seems familar,"Spoiler AlertThis was a decent enough read but the story seemed a little too familar to me. I later realized it was exactly like the episode of the series ""Soul Food"" entitled ""Ordinary Pain"". In that episode the Taylor girls (whose name is awfully familiar to Naylor)found out from their uncle they had a long lost sister name Nina too. Besides all that it was had its moments of humor."
1,Should be no stars,"I have just gotten over three funerals. My mother, father, and mother-in-law. No one in either family acted as badly as the women in this book.I could not finish the book. The details of planning the funeral, which were completely irrelevant to the story, were boring. The constant bickering of the sisters was a real turn-off. Sure I disagree with my sisters and sisters-in-law, but lovingly!And lastly, Uncle Thomas! Why the dialect? His brother was evidently a smart and provident man - however DID he amass all that money? - and his nieces are very well educated.Dialect as humor died about 50 years ago. Again - this did not contribute to the plot, such as it was, and was a distraction.I will NOT read any more books by this author. Life is too short to read bad fiction."
4,Entertaining,"After reading many intense pieces of literature, this was a nice light change of pace. I found it entertaining, funny and unpredictable."
3,book review,I did not like this book. The first half of the book just talks about her father dying and she is trying to get back to her home town and they are trying to make funeral arrangements. I did not finish the book because it took too long to get to the plot.
3,"""Dysfunction At It's Worst""","I have to say that this book was unique. The men in the book were strong shoulders for their women to depend on. Now the women...if you wanna call them that, were nothing but a bunch of ignorant, no-class having idiots. If it was possible to reach inside this novel, I would have kicked Collette's you-know-what myself!!! Dawn and Nina were the only ones with some sense. I can't say too much about Glynda and Renee. The plot-line was predictable and what I didn't care for at all was the way the writer had Uncle Thomas talking...it was embarrassing. The constant bickering was working my nerves too. If anything, Nina's the one who should be pissed because she was born 3 years BEFORE the other Naylor sisters. She didn't have the benefit of growing up around her sisters because her father was too embarrassed with what he had done. I guess that proves that the great Edward Naylor wasn't so perfect after all. This book was a trip."
2,'Just Us Girls' Book Review,"The ladies of 'Just Us Girls' Book Club reviewed this book in February 2003. The group felt the story line was too long, too dramatic, not realistic, too predictable and definitely not a page turner. This book was a very easy read but did not challenge us or encourage us to recommend to others."
1,UNBELIEVABLE AND FORGETABLE,"I had the misfortune of attempting to read this book. I say attempting because I was not able to finish it. After chapter 6, I was already bored with it and I found myself doing what I usually do when I have lost interest in a book and that is I started skimming it. I was disgusted with the constant bickering and juvenile behavior of the sisters, Uncle Thomas' speech patterns, the constant crying and the general lack of plot development. It was clearly one of the worst books ever. I didn't care about any of the characters and had no interest in the ending. How can a person leave that much money to that many people? I could not wrap my mind around it."
3,Too much for me,"I like this book, but I didn't like this book. First I have to say that the secret was predictable. I already knew that the man wasn't cheating and I knew that that was his love child before it even came out. They way they found out about Nina Blackford, was a little much to me. As far as their reactions were a little over the top if you ask me. I did like the fact that the characters were real in my eyes. I could see them as I read the book. It did make me cry as well. It was just too sad to think about some one dying all of a sudden to me. Over all I would say that I was a good pick for our book club, The Roven Readers. I just would have liked it to involved more then just a funeral."
2,"Kidnapped, not a good movie","From begining to end, this movie did not have more than 2 stars. Acting was not good for starters. Scenario was bad too. I mean, it did not follow any real life logic at all. People do not act like that if it happen. Now, some B movies that are really bad, they use skin, nudity, good looking females to get the people buy or watch their movie. Or they include graphic violance, lots of blood etc. this movie had neither. Watching it will be waste of your time."
4,Intense,This is a very dark and brutal movie if your sensitive to violence its not for you.Even I feel the need to watch a feel good flick after this.the actors are good and the camera work is amazing the realistic violence is disturbing but also makes you aware that bad things can happen in life because evil people are out their.Overall 4 stars For realism.
1,SO BAD!,"This was the worst movie I have ever seen! Chilling, very graphic, and made me feel sick... I do not recommend this to anyone."
5,what an inspiration,i loved this book...I read the prologe and couldnt put it down..its a true story of a young girl and all she had to overcome to put her life back to have meaning.....beautiful story about how to forgive
3,Quantity Over Quality,"Go figure, Lil Flip followed the same formula from his last album and put out another mediocre double disc cd. I know his first cd got leaked, but what we have here, is 2 and a half hours of Lil Flip's mediocrity. The lack of subject matter is mindblowing. I don't mind Lil' Flip, but he needs to learn to cut back on the quantity and focus on making 15 really good songs. Ghetto Mindstate is a fantastic song, but it is a diamond in the rough amongst all the songs about bling, cars and weed. After all this wait, you would think Lil' Flip would want to put out something that would reinvent himself. Evidently not."
5,FLIP style,"I don't know what other people are talking about. Lil Flip goes off on this CD. I will say though I bought this CD and Big Wheel Records - Hood Muzik on the same day and ended up listening to Hood Muzic more with those boys Froze ony, Rizzo, Younf tay, O2, Doughboy, and Lil Richard. Check it out!"
3,Lil Flip or Lil Flop???,"I hate to say it but Lil Flip has offically fall'N off.. Don't get me wrong this Album is OK not Good not really bad. But his album leaked over the internet last summer (via Sony) that's why the album is 2 disc's. He has all the songs from the leaked CD plus a few new song compiled over this album. So if you've never heard the leaked CD then you may like this album a lil better but since I played it for the past 8 months, it's really nothing new. The newer tracks arent anything special...The few stand-out tracks from this album are-Sorry Lil Mama (Feat Z-Ro)White Cup (Feat Mike Jones)"
1,Do not buy this,"Even if you are a master at installing European hinges without templates or instructions,I couldn't see how they would work for the full overlay application that I bought them for { 175 degree swing and FULL overlay}. After scratching my head with them for an hour, I realized it was not worth ruining a custom cypress entertainment unit and hand made frame and panel doors by using these total guess work hinges.Couldn't find brand and number specific instructions online. The shipping costs and hassle and time it would've taken in returning them wasn't worth it.They went in the trash."
2,Woodstock d3142 hinge,Hinge came with out a template. Hard to determine just where to drill thebig hole
5,"Great force feedback, great control","It totally controls the movement of the planes, pretty good sensitivity. Like the way it shakes when the plane is moving on the runway. Great product,!"
4,"Solid feel, good performer","I am using this joystick primarily with Flight Simulator X. After re-assigning the buttons the way I like them, the joystick performed quite well. My only complaint is that I do not like the way it centers. I am not getting positive feelback when centering the stick. This sometimes makes it difficult to maintain level flight.Other then that, it is well built and priced right."
2,I now know reason for low price...,"This joystick was my first (and last from Logitech).I cannot recommend this Product for the following reasons:1) Mechanical connection for Force Feed-back is Intermitant,as best.2) ""button 11"" works when it wants to.3) Gives false inputs until it warms up by hand.4) Force sensitivity cannot be calibrated (none to'stirring gravel')5) Cannot cancel out 'rudder shimmy'PROS:1) solid,sturdy base.2) It hasn't caught fire yet.Rick B."
5,customer service was great!!,The first stck delivered did not work properly. The twist function did not work. With some minor trouble shooting Logitech sent a new one immediately.
4,The Battlecrusiers Through the Eyes of a Man Who was There,"This outstanding book takes the reader back to the early days of WW1 and the British Navy's battle cruiser force. The book provides an excellent and often poignant look at life in these beautiful ships of war and additionally, provides some very useful insights into the roles and personalities of some of the eras great leaders and commanders. This book is an absolute must for anyone with an interest in the Royal Navy during WW1."
1,The author who helped to ruin the good name of the RN,"Filson Young was just a propaganda expert for Beatty. This book followed by his damming of Jellicoe after WWI helped ruined the reputation of the RN. Please read this mans book then read the books written by Rear Admiral J.E.T. Harper (The Truth about Jutland) and Admiral Bacon (The Jutland Scandal) and you will understand what I mean. While one can still find Filsons' book in print the other two can only be bought second hand.Beatty had twice the power of Hipper at Jutland and lost. His bust does not belong in Trafalger Square, it is an insult to Nelson, Jellicoe and Cunningham to have such a poor commander in their presence."
3,Just OK,"This is a writer who decides to stay home for 6 months with the kids - I think just for the purpose of writing a book and making money. If he really wanted to ""be there"" for his kids, why didn't he scale back on his career long-term?There are a couple of funny moments in the book, but nothing all that interesting."
3,The Trials and Errors Over a 6 Month Experiment,"I just couldn't get past the fact that this guy is a professional writer, as is his wife, who thought he might be able to sell some books on this unique subject. It honestly distracted me throughout the entire reading. His was an interesting experiment of a man working around the house for a few months. But hey let's face it, he is now back to his high-profile career of sports writing after having finished with this low profile writing project. Rent the movie ""Mr. Mom,"" it's better."
1,Why are they still married?,"I had purchased this book with eager anticipation. I too am a stay at home dad. There are a few humorous moments but on the whole this fellow is a brainless, selfish twit and his wife sounds like a complete ice queen. They both come across as incredibly selfish people. They are not a team, they don't work as a family. ""It's all about me ""is the central message in this book. Their kids are complete undisciplined brats- courtesy of the parents. How they stay married is a mystery.sadly... not worth your time although there were moments when it was a fun read. But not many."
5,GREAT read!,I read the book after watching Murphy interviewed on the Today Show. The book is just great with many laugh out loud funny moments. HIGHLY recommend! (Make your husband's read it!)
5,A Little Piece of History,"A phenomenal record of an 80's arena tour. Kind of a guilty pleasure that I rented from an obscure, now defunct, video store a long time ago. Having recently become interested once again in classic rock, I found it on line. Interesting thing is that this documentary was made by NFL films; I don't know if they ever did anything else like it. The quality is superb, as their products always are. And now it's a bit of an historic record of the band and its time. My entire family, from 6-year-old to 60-year-old, sat in our darkened living room Christmas night and watched it. Brought back many, many good memories. Includes live performances of many of Journey's best songs. And if you loved the videos for ""Faithfully"" and ""Send Her my Love,"" you'll recognize the footage."
3,"Good, but not what I expected","I thought this book would be like the other ""Complete Book of..."" series, like the Math, Science, Phonics, Money ones we have, or have seen. But, it is NOT! It is a wonderful resource book for world history, but NOT a workbook sort like the others, it has NO reproducible things, NO activities at all. It is nice for a timeline sort of book with the major events. If you are looking for a timeline resource book this should have 5 stars, but since it is not along the lines of the other Complete series I think it is misleading of the publishers."
3,This was too hard for my 4th grader,"I bought this book to homeschool my 4th grader, and it was too difficult for him. I switched to the US History book from the same series, and that is working much better. If your child is an average student, then this book is more appropriate for grades 6-8 than the 4-8 listed.As far as the series goes, I like the big pictures and the small sections. They make is easier to keep my child interested. I don't like that there are no test questions or real ways to see what he is retaining. I am having to create my own activities to go along with it and make my own tests and suppliment with library books, which is all very time consuming."
5,"Great ""extra"" text","Well done book. Gives just enough information for my 4th grader to be a good ""extra"" text - and ties in with other things that happened about the time of the entry, so they can research related topics. My 4th grader is really enjoying this one!"
3,"Decent game, but the picture and graphics are HORRIBLE!!!","I bought this game for my 8 year-old daughter for Christmas. She loves the game so far, but my complaint is that the picture is TERRIBLE! It reminds me of the Atari video games they had when I was a kid! I was expecting it to look similar to a video game system like PS2, but it does NOT! We don't have anything like a PS2, which is why I think my daughter doesn't care. But if your kid has one, I think they'll be disappointed in the graphics on this. Otherwise, it seems like a good game."
5,A definite winner!,"Our 11 yr-old (almost 12) daughter received this game for Christmas and absolutely loves it! Very creative game...let's the child choose styles, materials, designs. It's really interesting to watch her put outfits together and sometimes she even asks my advice!"
2,a lot of package for a little game,"My daughter likes the game, but it took her a while to figure out. To me it looks very low tech. The thing I didn't like most about buying this is it was a huge box for a little tiny game & by the time it was shipped here, one of the parts came out and was knocking around in the big gigantic box. Doesn't seem very enviromentally friendly to me to be using such a big box for a little game."
4,Great for the fashion Diva,"This game is great, only both my daughters and I are very frustrated with it. It did not come with very good instructions on how to play the game, and it took us about 3 days to figure out a place to make an outfit with the very limited funds they give you. After the show, we cannot figure out how to get more money, and without the money we cannot enter any other shows! Right now we seem kind of stuck, and annoyed."
4,Cool!,"For people who want to be a designer. This is the game for you. (Though it does get a little boring.) Just like dream life. Also, the commercial looks like it's only for little kids. it looks like they used the same girl as in the bratz designer contest. Commercial: Stupid Game: Pretty Good."
4,Good Review,This was bought for my 12 year old daughter and she loves it. This is the one item she has played with the most. I'll come home from work and she is playing with it on the tv - she is also drawing designs. This has turned out to be educational along with fun!
3,Ok for Older Girls,"This really is a great idea! However, the child needs to understand the whole concept of designing and showing clothes first... Then designing is the fun part. My daughter is 8 and would love to just design. She could care less about the whole fashion show stuff.Maybe she'll get into it when she's alittle older."
2,Designer's World,"My 11 year old daughter really wanted this for Christmas. I was hesitant and then I read all the positive reviews so I purchased it. What a waste of money. First, she thought is was hard to get going on it. Second, it held no interest. The ad for it is much better than the real thing.I can not recommend this ""toy""."
3,designers world game,"it was fun at first, but lost interest soon after. fast delivery and made a good christmas present for the preteens. thank you"
3,designer game,Not exactly what I expected. Takes some time to learn everything that you can do with it. Could be fun/satisfying for a child with a lot of patience- but do they exist???
5,"Great book, teaching the entire Perl language","I thought Teach Yourself Perl 5 in 21 Days was a great book. Don't worry about not understanding anything - it's all very easy to understand and the examples are very well described line by line. I did not rate this book a 10, however, because it fell short on it's claim to teach CGI scripting. Well, I think it must have been talking about the CD, but I think they designed the cover to look like that information was included in the text of the book. Get Teach Yourself Perl 5 in 21 days if you want to learn Perl. It is an excellent book."
4,Good for beginners,"This book isn't meant for advanced PERL programmers. But it was perfect for me, at the time I bought it and read it (fall 96), it really helped out with my knowledge of perl. If there was only one thing I wished it did have more of, was more longer scripts and real-world scripts. But other than that, I thought this book mas pretty good."
2,Pretty bad,"Stay away from this book unless you have a lot of time to waste. The author writes very thick. Even after reading serval hundred pages, you still won't know enough to write useful scripts. Learning Perl is much more concise"
1,After reading the book Ihave found several great uses for it,1. As a doorstop.2. Great for scrap paper3. Great as birdcage liner.4. Great firewood.5. Great reading while on the 'can'.
5,Great beginners book!,"This is the book that I used to teach myself Perl.I was able to breeze through it in 3 days, not 21 days and I would recommend the Teach Yourself series by SAMS to anyone who wants to learn a computer language.Later when you need a big reference book, I would recommend ""Programming Perl"" by O'Reilly."
5,5 Stars (minus 2 if you already know the basics),"I found it a great book at first, but after mastering the basics... errr... Therefore, Complaints as a beginner: None; Complaints as an intermediate: I won't tell people I know PERL if this is the only book I ever read."
4,Land Before Time,I have been buying these movies for my son when they first came out. He is 21 and he still likes to watch the Land Before Time movies.
4,A Good Buy,"I have had the DVD drive for a couple of weeks now, and have had no problems. The installation guide is brief. The drive might be difficult to install if you are a computer novice, so have an IT friend ""on call"" if you plan to do it yourself (the reason for 4 not 5 stars). I have had no problems reading DVDs or CD-ROMs on the drive. I have an 850 MHz Athlon machine with a good graphics card but with no decoder card and have only experienced minimal delays when viewing DVDs. Overall a very good buy, I'd highly recommend it."
2,in your way,it takes a lot of time to mold to the keys and it slows you down while you type. You have to press the keys much harder; and you're more likely to make typing mistakes. I don't recommend it. Save yourself the aggravation.
4,A book written about lawmen by a lawman,"Fist Full of Thorns is a book about Western lawmen written as only a lawman can tell the story. Who were the real villains, the Cow Boys or the Earps; the City Marshals or the County Sheriff? Michael Crane tells the story in black & white of a time when mostly it was shades of gray. This is an excellent read, and I learned more about the life and times of the Old West than in most of the other books on the subject that I've already read.I can't wait for Mr. Crane to write a book about Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid.I highly recommend this book for anyone who is a student of the Old West, or of law enforcement through the times."
3,an interesting beginning,"for a first album, this isn't great, but shows many of the elements that will eventually be melded into some great music on later albums. There are some very interesting songs though, many of them in an acoustic style, some with multiple vocalists on each song, and of course, Ayreon's overall concept story that marks most of his cds. I would say that on this album, he hasn't completely matured as a composer yet, and it shows on many of the songs. I would probably list this as fourth of his five albums in ranking, one above Flight of the Migrator. Get Dream Sequencer & Electric Castle, (or even Actual Fantasy first)"
4,Great start for a great artist,"The 'debut' album for Anthony Arjen Lucassen telling a story of the future set in the dark ages (yes, you would have to hear it for yourself to understand it)Arjen's vison begins here and carries through his following albums. He has yet to disappoint me."
4,"nice camera, eats batteries","The only downsides are that it eats batteries and the software that comes with it is of average quality. It feels like it has good build quality, not a cheap peice of plastic."
4,No power cord,"Overall i give this camera a pretty good rating, it takes great picture, it works nice as a webcam, and it shoots video.but one thing i dislike is, it does not come with the ac power adapter and so far i have not been able to find one anyplace.way to go fujifilm"
3,"Very good at daytime, bad at night-time","This is a very nice entry level digital camera. It is excellent to use at day time with ample lights. BUT, at night time you will see some white spots like snowflakes. So if you are looking for something to use just to get average pictures this is a very good one, very compact and easy to use."
4,Una compra a un precio justo!,"Hace poco tiempo compre dos camaras de este modelo, FinePix A101, y la verdad que ha resultado un buena compra a un precio justo.Si bien es cierto que no posee características técnicas extraordinarias, tiene ciertas ventajas, como el tiempo que se tarda en bajar las fotos, el cual es sumamente rápido. Además, el tamaño de la camara es conveniente para llevarla a cualquier parte, y con respecto al gasto en baterias, no es tan grande como pensaba, de acuerdo a otros comentarios de usuarios. Si se tienen baterías recargables éstas durarán un buen tiempo.En general, para el precio de esta cámara no se puede pedir más."
5,Fantastic Camera,"This is actually my first digital camera, but based on all of its features, I would say that I won't be buying another one for a long time. And, for under $200, it is probably the best camera out there. Webcam feature is fun & easy to use, movie mode is nice, and it takes crystal clear pictures, with different flash modes, self-timer to allow you to get in the shot, and easy USB connection to PC/Mac. The only thing I would suggest is to get some rechargeable batteries and/or an AC adapter when you're at your comp, because it eats up AA's pretty quickly. The 1.6"" LCD screen is very nice, because it lets you see your pics immediately, to see if you want to keep them. Also, compact enough to fit in your pocket! GREAT CAMERA!!"
4,Excellent value for money,"For less than $170 (July '02) this camera is a solid performer at a sensible price. Normal resolution is more than adequate for the web and e-mail. Fine resolution results in quality good enough for at least 4*6"" prints at your local Kits Cameras or similar.The non-audio 20 seconds of video is a bonus IMO.With WindowsXP (Home or Pro) on your PC you'll find this camera very easy to use, it is very straightforward to publish pictures to the web or automatically shrink and e-mail them instead.Only 2 downsides that I've found;1. The appears to be a tendency for dust to creep into the LCD disply area. Cosmetic only.2. Battery life w/ LCD use is relatively low. So, don't use the LCD for every photo or get the latest rechargeable AA batteries.I strongly recommend this camera for those seeking excellent value for money."
2,EATS UP YOUR BATTERIES,"While the quality of the pictures and the features of this camera are great, as other reviewers have mentioned, it eats up batteries like nothing I've ever seen before. I take about 6 pictures using the display and I have no battery left! Then, the moment you hook it up to your computer, it uses up the entire the battery. I called FUJI and they said ""Sorry, that's just how it is."" (Also, the software included is very poorly designed.)"
4,Nice pics but.....,"...it drains batteries. I've taken about 10 pics and on my 3rd set of batteries. Apparently, when I used it as a PC cam for about 10 minutes, the batteries ran out. I suggest ordering rechargeable batteries and an AC power cord.I still haven't figured out how to download the pics from the camera to the computer. I'll try when the cord comes in. Batteries are getting expensive."
2,Used is the key word.,The description of the product was mis leading in the description of the memory card. The cam. Itself had no transfer cable.
5,Sweet Creamy Body Lotion,"First of all it smells just like heaven. You will have a very light, fresh, sweet scent left on your body. It is a very light scent and not overpowering by any means; it is subtle but provocative I think. It has a light/medium weight to it and isn't at all heavy. If this lotion gets old in the bottle; when you put it on you may get the occasional lump and it may roll onto your skin instead of melting into it like when it's only a few weeks old but if you use it regularly; it won't get old because in one month it will be used up. I used it after showering, when waking up in the morning and whenever I needed to spot treat certain body parts like my hands and elbows for dryness throughout the day."
1,Mint Julep Body Lotion,"I was not a fan of this lotion. A few years ago I had purchased a Savannah Bee Company lotion in an airport and absolutely loved it. It wasn't greasy and smelled heavenly. I attempted to order more, only to find it wasn't made anymore, so I tried to substitute with this lotion. I did not enjoy the scent of this, nor was the feel the same as what I had previously. A great disappointment."
1,Poor handling and rancid product,"I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas from a vendor other than Amazon but through Amazon. It arrived with its pump top having been opened and the product was rancid. I actually purchased 2 lotions at the same time from the same vendor. One was wrapped in bubble wrap and may have been ok I we had unwrapped it but since the other was not wrapped at all, and had leaked on the wrapped one, and was rancid, I decided to send both back without trying to determine if the other was ok."
5,A fine book by a fine author,"Eric Hammel is a splendid writer, and this book is a splendid account of the Guadalcanal campaign. Part of a trilogy which included volumes about the naval aspects of the Guadalcanal battle, ""Starvation Island"" focuses on the land and land-based air phases of this far-flung struggle. Well-written and entertaining, this is history at its best. Along with the other fine volumes about the Guadalcanal campaign, such as Richard B. Frank's excellent work (""Guadalcanal: The Definitive Account of the Landmark Battle"") this book will be enjoyed by anyone interested in this crucial turning point in the war in the Pacific."
3,Read the Leckie or Frank Histories,"This version adds very little to the Leckie History--Challenge for the Pacific: Guadalcanal: The Turning Point of the War. Starvation Island covers most of the same ground.The Frank history ""Guadalcanal"" is probably the most definitive history, although Leckie is better reading."
4,Diner Coffee Mug,"Ahhhh, now THIS is how coffee was meant to be enjoyed. In a mug that will break your foot if you ever drop it. Heehee! Solid, perfect coffee mug."
3,Authentic diner mug,This product is exactly what it was stated to be. Cons are it is quite heavy and handle is too small. The handle size only accommodates one finger.
3,Almost Perfect,"This is exactly what I wanted. Its a thick coffee mug exacly like you will find in an old diner. Nice and thick, keeps your stuff hot longer. Nice and heavy with a big finger ring hole. I love it!Only down fall is, it`s made in China! So I took away 2 stars because of that. Other than that, it`s a 5 star."
5,The old way is best . . .,"I've been looking for a coffee-mug like this one for a while. Coffee just does not taste the same if you're not using one of these mugs! Great purchase! Quick delivery! Awesome price and shipping, too!"
4,I like these mugs,I order 6 of these mugs and I like them as they are sturdy and my husband hasn't managed to knocked the handle off them like he has managed to do with a lot of my more delicate cups.
1,Complete ripoff,This was a complete ripoff. It is an article that was written back in 2004. It is not informative and doesn't even let you know where you can buy the product. Complete waste of time and money.
4,A solid reference book,"This book was so much more than I thought it would be. A really good surprise. Even though it is an older took, it is a very solid reference book. Instead of the usual little 1/4 inch thick book you get these days...this book is a full 1.25 inches thick...and covers tons of embroidery stitches and so much more."
3,a family thanksgiving,"we enjoy different holiday movies and this, to watch on thanksgiving, was acceptable and we do watch it each year. it had a happy ending and that's always nice."
5,Say You Need Me,A REAL PAGE TURNER! I could not put the book down once I opened it and started reading. Kayla Perrin makes your feel like Serena is your best friend and that your're living this book with her. The characters are well defined and likable. The book is awesome! I love this author.
2,"The book starts off pretty well,","but it doesn't take very long to realize you're reading not just a fairy tale, but a hard-to-believe-at-any-level fairy tale. The characters are just too extreme, and seem to change their minds, positions and attitudes every six seconds, but in a completely predictable and noninteresting way. First off, in any normal situation, Serena would've found herself facing assault charges. Second, the whole romance thing is just too pat; it happens in seconds, but then you're asked to jump from one side to the other with the characters, and keep the whole thing in perspective. Serena's reasoning is just too flawed, and anyone who's ever read a novel before can see what's coming 400 miles ahead. I can definitely beleve Kayla Perrin has written so many novels; much like Barbara Cartland did, she cranks them out like link sausages, with little regard to plot, believeability, or, for that matter, good writing."
4,A Very Good Book,I like romance and mystery. This was a good book. It had great characters and a great story. I would recommend it.
4,Its nice,"I do like the fixture, the only negative things I have to say are that the cover underneath looks a little cheap when you're looking up at it. Also, it is very difficult to change a light bulb because there are so many pieces that have to be unscrewed. Other than that, the look is quite nice and mostly how I expected it."
2,Another Climactic Image Cut,"When I saw this film in its theatrical release it was outstanding, but this DVD cuts out the most powerful and climatic erotic image!(when the head nun bares her breast with a erotic, demented look on her face). . . Aesthetic butchery."
2,didn't get what I thought I ordered,"Be warned, I was shipped a wide shoe even though my order said nothing about it being a wide(W). If you buy this item, check the size right away and make sure it is what you ordered."
2,"GOOD FACTS, BAD WRITING","In preparation for a trip to the Peru Amazon, I purchased Hidden Amazon. The book has many useful tidbits about the Amazon and the immediate environs, but the writing style is so juvenile as to be off-putting. The shameless touting of one tour company grows old fast and one starts to wonder why one paid full price for a sales promotion. The photos are excellent, but not one has a description.There must be better books about this area. I recommend you keep looking"
1,The Hidden Amazon,"This book was totally uninspiring. If I had read the book before I signed up for the trip it chronicled, I would not be going to the Amazon. It should be removed from the IE list of recommended books!"
1,(Pssst . . . over here),"(""The Hidden Amazon"" follows Jeff Bezos from his early years, when he was found and raised by a small herd of boa constrictors, up through the present day, a time when he reveals his whole world--a world of books and more--through his quietly revolutionary website. This is a fascinating read for aspiring entrepreneurs. But shhhhh . . . if word gets out of this secret world, this ""amazon.com,"" it could ruin the magic.)"
4,Very Complete....Almost,"This book is well written and nearly perfect for those transitioning to a management position with little time to spare. I found it to be well organized and concise, highlighting good common sense principles to remember when you take the helm of your new position. It addresses many of the common stereotypes and pitfalls new and experienced managers encounter. The book does fall short of one of the back covers claims about hiring. Nowhere within it's pages does it discuss hiring strategies or interviewing skills. This was disappointing and a critical piece missed by the author."
4,A lot of value in a small volume,I went through a lot of book reviews before choosing this book. I was a new manager about a year ago in a new industry and wanted some basic usable and easy to digest advice. This was a great reference tool and I would suggest anyone who needs a bit of management help to go ahead and take the plunge - buy it.
3,OK,"Here at my house we didn't enjoy this book. It was hard to read, simply because it wasn't interesting enough to keep interested in and it was a lot of words describing basic skills that aren't so hard to implement. The time it took to read was over the amount I would allot for it normally. We have studied management other ways and this was not efficient."
4,Good shoe for a very good price,It was a little stiff for the first few days but eventually it loosened up. Good pair of shoes.
5,Great shoes! Good quality & comfortable,Owned these for about a month now. They have a nice shine and can be worn casual or dress. Good buy for shoes under $40.
2,"cheap materials, wear big","These look pretty nice but the underlying materials are pretty cheap. I don't think they are really leather and if they are it's really low grade. The bottoms are very cheap plastic-y material. I'm 11.5 -- no problems buying other shoes online -- but these feel at least 0.5 a size too big, probably close to 1 full size too big. I should have returned them......"
3,Decent slip-on shoe has expected performance,"Well, I got these for something in the realm of $30, so I wasn't expecting the most comfortable shoes on the planet. They look great, and are somewhat waterproof - they won't get nasty blemishes after getting wet. Instead, you can pretty much just wipe them clean. They can be a little rough to break in at first, and I definitely recommend getting an insole (I got one with memory foam that makes these feel great). Overall a pretty decent shoe."
4,pretty good,"Overall happy with them. The tongue of the shoe is still bothering me 3 weeks later. It digs into my foot when I walk. Otherwise, comfortable, look nice and worth the money."
1,Was comfy - but only for 1 month ! Would never buy again,"I bought it in July 2008, and didn't need the pair till Septempber.Within 2 weeks of my normal office wearing I could feel that the right side heel is sinking in a bit. And in another 4 weeks it totally sunk in and now there is a huge crack on right heel above the sole.I didn't pay a lot for it - but Kenneth Cole should be ashamed of even their name being associated with this product."
5,"Great Westerberg collection, great compliment to best of replacements","Paul Westerberg emmerged on the music schene in the early 80's with the Minneapolis based ""Replacements"" and went on to a good career with them until he struck out solo in the early 90's with his 14 songs album. His sound was a very strong driving force of the replacements, and it carried into his own music. Don't forget his two albums as Grandpaboy, an alter ego he liked to use, often more experimental with his sound and more acoustic as well on those albums. This is a great starter album for a person who likes paul westerberg, and will likely lead to buying the rest of his albums. I like the fact that they included some good b-sides, but hard to include everything, like choosing between ""dyslexic heart"" and ""waiting for somebody"" off of the singles soundtrack. So many good songs, just one disc. Lets see a two disc set at some point. This is a must buy for westerberg fans."
3,For those who own the albums already...,"... although I don't see it available here, I have seen listings online for an EP called ""The Resterberg"", which features most of the hard-to-find stuff: Dyslexic Heart, Seein' Her (Single Version), Man Without Ties (Single Version), A Star Is Bored, Stain Yer Blood (Single Version), Once Around The Weekend (Alternate Mix), All That I Had (Previously Unissued Outtake), C'mon, C'mon, C'mon (Previously Unissued Outtake). Don't know if it was a limited release, but (among other places) the Rhapsody online service still has it available for download."
3,Real live bleeding fingers,"A spotty collection by a shambolic, genius talent...reviewers below have noted all the greats that were left off, and it's true - not sure what the compilers were up to. To the greats that they left off, let me add my own personal fave, ""Born for Me""....I think it's telling and indicative of Westerberg's talent and career that in the liner notes to this, he expresses amazement that Lennon thought ""Nowhere Man"" was a throwaway, having turned in an amazingly slapdash, dirgelike, one-off of said tune himself..."
5,"altough it was over 300 pages long, it was worth the reading","i have read previous linda barnes books and they were not that long, but i enjoyed this 6th novel in the carlotta carlyle series. carlotta is a very dedicated p.i it is a pity she does not take sam her on and off again boyfriend seriously. i also like the relationship she has with her little sister paolina. all the characters are well placed and it makes for interesting reading. linda barnes keep up the good work and i look forward to reading. for anyone out there that have never read a linda barnes novel please do so."
4,Fascinating but geeky :),"I admit to being a bit of a farriery geek. This book is a collection of articles on shoeing methds for very specific disciplines. I might never own a harness racer or need to shoe a Clyde of the show ring, but I sure found the info interesting, and it did help me understand some of the mechanics of shoeing better. A very interesting read, but not Shoeing 101."
4,would recommend,"This is a collector volume I would buy again or recommend to someone....all the movies were good...I especially like the movie ""Borrowed Hearts"" and have watched at least 8 or 9 times. My husband really enjoys the movies as well...very tender, great story, excellent cast...a must see!The other three were great too and a ""Hobo's Christmas"" had excellent cast as well...very great ending and definitely for the whole family. A great movie to watch year after year..Dennis Rainey plays such a good part and in reality many of us have experienced problems in our families as well....wait till the end...it's a neat story that really gets to your heart...I liked this movie!The ""Man who saved Christmas""...well this story is such a neat story...no wonder it's true! What a heart for children and much less Christmas...anyone watching this would have to most likely really like this story...a surprise ending brings this story to the real meaning of Christmas! I loved it.!"
1,Not for hard of hearing,"I loved all of these movies when shown on TV. However, Echo Bridge Home Entertainment does not offer closed captioning nor sub-titles on these Christmas delights. That includes not only this edition, but other 4 in 1 Christmas movies they offer. A poor choice for someone like me, who is hard-of-hearing."
3,Good GENERAL information,Good information basically summarized. Most regions described are generalized but it gives you good information to start from. Maps could have been much better though.
4,Daughter loves it,"My 5 year old has been watching these newer Care Bear movies for a while and really loves them, they keep her occupied and happy"
4,Christmas gift,"Got this for my husband for Christmas, he was happy to receive it and will probably write his own review later..."
2,"Works, sort of","When it works it functions fine, but I get some funky color inversion when I switch between inputs, fairly often (picture has lots of purple). Power cycling the unit fixes the issue.I'm wondering if the R G B is being messed up as Y Cb Cr."
3,Bear Women's Double Breasted Coat,This stylish coat is good for a night on the town when the weather is cold but not at freezing temperatures. I like the versatility of the removable collar and cuffs. But I was expecting a really thick down coat and this coat came in a small box and it didn't have that much down filling in it.
1,Disappointing,"The author attempts to revicit his methodology in Talmudic studies on biblical studies, without really doing it. He creates a philosophy called Chatu Israel, which means that the text of the bible was lost, but he does not deal with it specifically."
2,A good series goes downhill,Don't get me wrong -- I enjoyed the TimeWars series. But this book starts its decline as Simon Hawke takes the easy plot route: creating a Moriarty-like supervillain. The character of Drakov was complex in the prior book (the Zenda Vendetta) but devolved into a mindless maniac here. The rest of the books are basically the same rehash of villain vs. good guys.
3,red cat racing 1/10 buggy nitro 4wd,"it`s really fun to drive, it,s really fast to, but it`s going broke even if you are very carefull, the distance of the remote control it`s very short so you have to buy a failsafe or it will end up like mine against a wall jejejje. and don`t take it to an off road r/c track it`s not made for jumping either."
4,The Art of War,"What more could you ask for, Machiavelli and how he describes the best way to win a war. Hard to put down."
5,Six parallel translations of Proverbs are especially useful,"The wisdom contained in Proverbs has always been of particularinterest to me, and through the years I've acquired a number of useful commentaries on the Book of Proverbs . And I must agree with what Cody Jones briefly touched upon in the introduction to his book - that all too many commentaries (both older and more modern ones) are entirely overly academic and rather arid in their treatments, which in most cases clearly are not intended to help the average person in the practical, day-to-day pursuit of wisdom.I must say that I very much enjoy the format of Cody's new work, and consult it frequently on a daily basis since I've purchased it. What I've found especially useful is the six parallel translations of the Proverbs near the end of the book."
3,"A useful reference, BUT...","In view of the glowing reports by other readers, I am reluctant to say so but, frankly, I am disappointed in this work. It is a useful reference, but I find it somewhat superficial in its treatment. I have found the older, more modest ""Everyman's Bible Commentary"" to provide a deeper analysis, and to better tie Proverbs to other scripture."
1,"Incomplete, Superficial and Deceptive","I found this book to be a series of incomplete, inaccurate and superficial ""comments"" on the book of Proverbs rather than the COMMENTARY it put itself forth to be. The print is 12 to 14 point and too many of the pages have much space left for more information. A little more than a third of this big hardcover book is filled with different Bible translations of the book of Proverbs. I already have a Bible. Remove the translations and it would have been better to serve it up as a devotional booklet. I'm pretty disappointed. I want my money back."
2,Dull.,"I've bought them all. This is the worst. Didn't laugh much, went long stretches without even smiling."
5,Killer Shrews Owns!!!,"Okay, you probably can tell that I love the Killer Shrews episode. My brothers and I saw it for probably the first time last summer, and we still quote it today. Even the commentary for the rodeo thinging. It is so freakin' hilarious. I don't really know much that I can say. Mike and his robots comment on the movie and have little stuff about it. Like they like take a break in the middle of the movie and sort of talk about it or whatever.Now, the only other movie I saw in the set was Hercules Against the Moon Men which was also pretty funny. The movies alone were horrible. Sometimes, they're so horrible, they don't need commentary to make me laugh. Hercules Against the Moon Men is also funny. It's no Killer Shrews, but it is funny. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is looking for a good laugh as the TV shows get back on their feet at the end of this writers strike. It's also good if you're looking for laughs any time of year."
3,"Could have been better,but I enjoyed it.","An okay ""collection"" of ''THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES'', ''THE LUCY SHOW'',and ''THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW''.The picture quality on the ''TAGS'' episodes looked like they do on TV,same with the ''TBH'' episodes, however ''THE LUCY SHOW'' episodes were very bad.They were full of black and white dots and lines and some of the audio skipped,but I could unsterstand what was being said.There is one bad thing,though:Not a one episode of any show contains the original music,the ''THB'' replacement theme was terrible,there were no words except for when the announcer says ''THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES!'' in a very loud voice,and ''THE LUCY SHOW'' replacement theme is about as close to the original you're gonna get! However,the ''TAGS'' replacement was much better than other companies replacement theme.But don't pay more than $10 and if you don't feel like waiting for them to come from Amazon, you may want to try your local Best Buy or Wal*Mart store,I bought mine at Best Buy."
3,The Constitution,The book Shh!We're Writing y the Constitution by Jean Fritz.They all had to meet and they all showed up at different times. Benjamen Franklin was carried by some prisoners. This is a good book and you will learn alot from it. Theme is a good story element for this story because you learn alot about life. If you like books about the constitution than you will like this book.
5,Delightful reading for all ages,"Great narrative -- engrossing and educational for ALL ages.De Paola's (of Strega Nonna fame) illustrations are absolutely perfect -- they convey the individual's character as well as their emotions during this 4 month stressful, enlightening brilliant and difficult time in our nation's history -- the rewriting (which turned into the total re-write) of the Articles of Confederation which became our nation's Constitution.This appeals to all ages -- and having just completed the reading and study of several wordy tomes having to do with the Constitutional Convention, ""Shh! We're Writing the constitution"" provided a delightful conclusion to my studies, as well as welcomed comic relief."
4,Cool illustrations,Very cool pictures that had my 8-year-old laughing and shaking his head at a rather unobservant Bob.
3,Good Overview of Opinions of Henry,"This is less a biography than it is a overview of how Henry has been treated by historians, dramatists, and population culture. The actual life and assessment of the man takes up less than a third of the book and is pretty standard stuff. The analysis of how history has treated Henry is interesting and good source material but the absence of any real coherant theme under the analysis or final summing up undermines its value. I would say this is good source material for a college paper if you didn't want to read the orginal texts and helpful for the reader to learn where to go next, but not the best source for an understanding of various interpretations of Henry."
2,"""God made..."" is the theme","""God gave me a tail to wag,And I say, 'Woof!'""Who knows my name?""I do! Do you?""dog""Each of the six animals this book features is presented with words as above and a Thomas Kinkade painting in which the animal is featured. The last two-page spread has a scene with all six animals in it and the following words:""Of course, God made lots more than just us few.""What's your name?""Did God make you?""If you are seeking a religious book introducing animals, this book is lovely."
1,Perfect reflection of the author's boredem!,If you are cool with someone putting you down then go right ahead and read it.
4,I love it but some things are dumb...,"I love this littlest pet shop! It comes with a really cute Sheepdog with an adorable flower in it's fur, it has three magnets to hold on securely, and a REALLY big bed. The things that makes me mad is that it's head always tipps back, and it will only drink the bottle if it's in it's bed. Otherwise, i love it!"
5,Last of the great Jem and the Holograms,Was everything it promised to be and excellent service. The previous seasons I already had but the last remaining season three were finally released on this DVD set.
5,Perfect!,We bought this for our neice for Christmas! She loved it :-) It was such a joy to share my child favorite with a new generation.
3,JBL Speaker Mounts,"Strong and fairly easy to assemble. I had to buy one set of Yamaha indoor/outdoor speakers also because the JBLs were ""just six available"" and I needed seven. The Yamahas came with everything you need to mount them for just a bit more money. No where near the extra it cost to buy the JBL mounts though."
5,Excellent reading material on The Jet's system of Karate,This book is very concise and deals with all facets of his art/philosophy equally. There isn't anything [I find] that is left out and shows you quite a few techniques. All techniques and methodology are explained in great detail--in plain English. Good Work Benny. :)
5,Best capo I have ever used.,"This is the best capo I have ever used on my Flamenco nylon string guitar. You have to have equal tension on every string or the buzz will drive you crazy and effect your playing and sound. Quick on and off and great on the first fret. A lot of capos have trouble with the first fret which is a shock since ""F"" is a popular piano key and you can find yourself there frequently."
4,Work as instructed if you use them as instructed.,"I have a problem with particularly vicious, evil woodpeckers putting nice round holes all over my wood siding, so I decided to give these a try. Although they aren't the decorations I would choose if I had a choice, they do work to scare off the woodpeckers, IF you move them every few days, etc., etc. These are not a be-all, end-all solution to a bird problem, but they definitely slow down the rate at which my house is being swiss-cheesed. Would recommend for any one who has woodpecker problems and has the time to drag the ladder out every few days to move these around."
1,This radio is junk. Don't buy it.,"I own this radio. It doesn't pull in radio stations very well and sometimes shorts out, resets the clock and all the radio stations I have set.If you like static, this radio is for you. Listening to this radio on headphones is unbearable."
3,"Illustrations are fabulous, content should be more kid-friendly","The illustrations in this book are very colorful and lively. I liked that each page had a different illustrator, so there is a good variety of visual attraction. However, the language could be simplified so that the content is more appealing to the average young child. As it is, the language seems more geared to an adult audience."
3,ASL and voiced -- something's missing!,"I haven't seen this yet, and I don't know whether I will. I am definitely interested in the topic, but the options aren't adequate for me. It's presented in ASL, and it's voiced. I don't see anything about closed captioning or subtitles, and that's what I need for movies. I imagine there are a lot of people like me who don't fit into either the hearing or the deaf world completely and require subtitles for understanding. Is the deaf world the last to catch onto this? If so, it's rather ironic."
2,Not the best nor the worst,"The good: I felt like I was stepping into a small church in a hollow unfortunatly as an observer rather than a believer.The bad: If anything, the account was a little too simplistic and left far too much to blind faith without reason based upon the entirety of scripture."
4,A thorough study,This was a very good book because it gives a thorough explanation of the origins of Reiki and how western civilization has adapted it to their liking.
2,Not for the beginner...dosen't keep your attention,Only read the 1st chaper...its not keeping my attention. The writing style I don't think is for the beginner. Need to find a better source that will keep my attention.
2,"Not a Self-Defense Book, ( i secound this view )","Not a Self-Defense Book,The book is not about self defense or street defense as the title alludes to. It is a book with great submission holds. But, before one can attempt to apply these submission holds they must be capable of fighting hand to hand and then successfully and safely be able to place their attacker into one of these holds; not likely without alot of previous experience and training. Pass on this book unless you are an experienced fighter looking for some good finishing holds;but the book does a poor job is detailing the application of these techniques"
3,"Not polished, but chock full of finishing holds","Although the book says it's about ""Combat"" - its strong point is really finishing holds. As it says in the introduction, it's about getting an attacker to submit without resorting to a gun or other weapon. You will have to find other material to learn about entering a fight, trapping and take downs. My biggest complaint with the book though, was that the pictures aren't really of the quality I expected. All the photos were vaguely blurry and not lit to highlight the step in the technique being discussed. I found it a hard way to learn."
1,grappling master,Book smelles as if it was soaked in water and allowed to mold. Book arrived wrapped in a brown grocery bag. very unhappy
2,Not a Self-Defense Book,"The book is not about self defense or street defense as the title alludes to. It is a book with great submission holds. But, before one can attempt to apply these submission holds they must be capable of fighting hand to hand and then successfully and safely be able to place their attacker into one of these holds; not likely without alot of previous experience and training. Pass on this book unless you are an experienced fighter looking for some good finishing holds; but realize for everyone of these holds there is at least one counter or escape move, so learn those also. For those of you looking for self defense books refer to my ""Listmania"" suggestions."
5,Riveting,I am currently reading this book and can't put it down. My mother's family knew the family of the victim and my grandfather was one of the volunteer deputies called on by Sheriff Emig on that fateful night.
4,3 lower leg supports pieces missing in box,"I gave this product only 4 stars as it had the 3 lower leg screw supports missing from the box. However I had in my same shipment 2 other Frenchi items...which i was able to repurpose the missing 3 legs..by switching the screw ones for the unscrew ones. :-) Brilliant!You would only understand this if you order one. Make sure all the parts are there before assembling it. I like the stand for a green bamboo plant holder with a prayer plant. Very nice colour combo...cherry color wood, very good.I would consider getting another or something similiar to coodinate in the room.cheers...mc"
1,"Cheap, fragile piece of junk","This product came in a very small box which was extremely light... much lighter than one would expect for a piece of furniture this size. This was an ominous sign, and I began to get the feeling that I'd paid too much for it. When the box was opened, I found I was correct. The materials are extremely cheap. I would have expected to pay no more than $10 for this product. When I screwed the legs on, I tried to ensure it was a tight fit so it would be secure (the thing is so darn flimsy after all). Though I didn't use that much strength, the wood began to split! To add insult to injury, when I placed my ultraportable, 3 lb laptop on top of it, it began wobbling like a drunk schoolgirl. I would not recommend this."
3,Left hanging,"Instead of a history of the LRRPS, LRPs and Rangers, this book is a collection of a single tale from each unit, but not all tales or all units. While each story is intense and well-written, we are left begging for more. In fact, I felt a bit let down. It was as though I were at a meeting of every living LRRP, LRP and Ranger, but could only have one story from one member of each unit. The result is a great collection of short stories, but not an authoritative history of the subject matter. A good read if you want a taste of the business, but should be retitled ""The Best of ...."" or something along that line."
4,A READER FROM PA.,"KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT, JUST LIKE HIS OTHER BOOKS. HE'S BEEN THERE AND DONE IT. SHOWS A REAL PROBLEM WE STILL HAVE TODAY. WE LET OUR TROOPS DOWN WHEN THEY NEED SUPPORT. SOMEBODY SETTING IN A OFFICE RUNNING THE SHOW, WHEN THEY AREN'T OUT FRONT OF TROOPS LEADING THE WAY.TOO MANY RINGKNOCKERS NOT ENOUGH ON THE JOB TRAINING."
4,"Phantom Warriors: Book I: LRRPs, LRPs, and Rangers in Vietnam (Phantom Warriors)","At first i was a bit amazed by the cheap thin papers of this book and wasn't quite sure what to except from it all.True combat stories of Vietnam, and that is exactly what it is. This book is filled with action. Action so real that your skin will crawl, and you will get chills when reading it.Unreal action stories combined with sometimes humorous moments, and off course the unimaginable things done during warfare."
2,Autodesk VIZ 4 Training CD,"I am an architect with more then average VIZ skills and I was looking for some new features. SURPRISE ! This is not a ""training CD"", is barely a very poor and bad VIZ 4 e-manual. Never buy this thing."
1,"Not training, kidding","I never recommend it. Its the worst training CD I ever seen, not proffesional."
1,Don't waste your money.,"I purchased this game because I thought it would be similar to a game I used to play called Sea World Park Tycoon. Boy was I wrong, this game is not user friendly at all. I don't care for the graphics. All around I was just very disappointed."
4,Very Fun Game,I rated game 4 because it should come with directions on how to play the game. I can not pick up the animals or workers to move them. And once you put something somewhere it is there for life unless you sell it you cant move it. If anyone know how to move the objects let me know. On my zoo empire you can move all animals workers and building.
5,Faithful and Spirit-driven,"It is a joy to recommend this most recent accomplishment of Scott Hahn to anyone looking for a faith-filled, Spirit-driven, and completely delightful exposition of the meaning of the family in all of its divine and human implications."
4,Based On A Literal Interpretation Of The Bible,"Hahn is basically a scholar who knows how to write in a style understandable to the average layman. In FIRST COMES LOVE he explains how God calls us to love and produce families. Hahn also describes the relationship between the Holy Trinity and the family units formed by us on earth.The strengths of the book are based mostly on Hahn's readable writing style and his generous use of vivid examples drawn from his own life. The biggest weakness, in my opinion, is that so much of the book appears to depend heavily on a literal interpretation of the Bible."
2,I didn't like it or use it,I should have read what the description was for this book a little bit better. It wasn't what I wanted.
5,I can't believe I'm the first to review this?,"I purchased this from the official Mickey Mantle site years ago and have watched the couple hour program many times... what you have is many fun clips of the Mick playing etc but what most of the two hours is ....is Mickey Mantle sitting in his trophy room casually dressed in a sweater and very engagingly discussing his entire life and career.This is time capsule stuff and I can only dream about so many other great icons of Sport, finance and politics that it would be amazing to have a couple hours of them talking directly to the camera about their lives and elaborating on stories true and only legend.If you are a fan I recommend this without reservation ...its going to be a treasure in your Yankee/Mantle collection....and that is from a lifetime Dodger fan!!"
4,"It's great, but be careful","It does exactly what it's supposed to do. It sticks on the door of the dishwasher and reminds everyone when the dishes are clean or dirty.But, be careful. I was cleaning the dishwasher door and noticed a bunch of scratches in the finish (stainless). I guess my kids have just been spinning it rather than lifting it off then placing it back on (yeah, I'm probably guilty as well).So if you have a stainless finish on your dishwasher, you might want to see if you can glue a thin piece of felt onto the magnet, or at the very least, don't just spin it."
2,I Should Have Read the Reviews,"I expected this to be a rubberized ""all over magnet"". Instead it's a piece of plastic with a tiny round magnet glued to the back. So far it seems to stick to the dishwasher door, but it's always tipped sideways. Certainly not anything very great. Just a cheap dollar-store item priced way too high for what it is. At least the shipping was free with my Prime membership.Update - July 2012 - Shortly after writing the above review, the plastic part of the magnet completely fell off my dishwasher, leaving the little round magnet behind. We have tried to put it back together multiple times and it continues to fall apart when left on the warm dishwasher. The only solution is to remove it from the door when it's in use. Who remembers to do that every time? Who wants to be bothered? Save your money. This is a hunk of junk!"
2,Disappointing,"This product arrived in the package, however broken, and with the black paint scratched on more than one part. I was obviously unimpressed that I ordered a product that arrived to me broken and in poor quality. If I had known how cheaply it was made I would have thought twice before purchasing it."
1,magneet fell off first day,"The glue they use is not good at all. Plastic sign came off the magnet withing 24 hours of receiving my order. I thought this may have been a sheet magnet but it's not, it's a black ceramic style magnet glued to the plastic sign. Need to buy some decent glue to make it whole again, assuming the wife hasn't already thrown it away."
5,Great product and got it fast!,Great magnet! I received it very fast and was completely satisfied with my purchase! I would definitely buy through thisq company again!
1,Terrible,This product broke within 24 hours of receiving it....the magnet fell off of the plastic. I can glue it back in but I really shouldn't have to... Also looks cheap.
2,"cheap, but so was price",Definitely cheaply made. Magnet fell of as I pulled it out of the package. Not even worth trying to exchange since I only paid a few bucks for it. Just poured on the super glue.
5,Great product,I got this product because my husband always said he thought the half full dishwasher contained clean dishes so he didn't put his dirty dishes in. I love that this product prevents that argument! Unfortunately my husband still forgets to put his dishes in the dishwasher. It's a great product and worth the price but it isn't a magic product! :p
4,Helpful,"There were minor flaws on the surface, looked like ink marks. Overall a good product. Daughter loves to play with it."
1,Came apart after one use and scratched our diswasher,"Not happy with this purchase, but you get what you pay for right? The magnet came unglued from the sign after only a few days. It scratched our stainless steel dishwasher. The magnet part of it also broke in half and I found my daughter with it in her mouth! Ugh!Would not purchase this again"
4,EASY for Forgetful me.,"I keep this on my stainless steel dishwasher. When I press the ""start"" button, I simply flip/turn the magnet so ""clean"" is up. That way, I know dishes are clean if I come in later and can't remember. When I unload the dishwasher and it is empty, then I turn the magnet so ""Dirty"" is up and readable."
3,Small and dingy,It was smaller than expected and it looks dingy as far as black blotches where it should be white. But I'm sure it'll get the job done. The sellers are sweet for writing me a personal happy holiday message ..even tho they spelled my name wrong. Haha
1,Definitely not a film for everyone...,"While I applaud the fresh and unique concept of having modern-day characters speak completely in Shakespearean prose, you have to be a real devotee of The Bard to enjoy this film; unfortunately, I'm not, so I didn't. The acting was quite good, and the men were certainly attractive, but neither was enough to make me want to sit through more than a half-hour of this film before I removed the DVD and, quite frankly, trashed it. I guess I was expecting a love story along the lines of Beautiful Thing, or Big Eden, or Latter Days...at least with those films, I could follow along and empathize with the characters. Private Romeo was slow and difficult to follow, and I found it impossible to relate to any of the characters because they never seem to be developed beyond their ability to emulate the original characters of the play. If you really love Shakespeare, buy this film; if you're not a fan, however, don't waste your time or money."
1,Boring!!,"Everything was telling me not to buy this movie, but I bought it anyway and surprisingly I was right, it's really boring and nonsense in my opinion. I thought it was so boring I couldn't even finish watching it!"
1,Idea not fulfilled,It was silly and after watching for 50 minutes I stopped the film and threw it out. It really needed to be updated and not use the original text of the play.It was silly and embarrassing to see a male called Juliet.
1,private romeo,I didn't care for the way this video followed the Romeo & Juliet by Shakesphere. The different ending was the best and the fact that it was finally over. I didn't understand how this was taking place in a military school on a break.
1,Shakespear NOT,I liked the premise of this movie but the Shakespear talk was just too much for me. I love the boys in a training school premise though. I won't comment on the acting.
5,Beautifully produced!!!,"I have been waiting to see this movie for so long and now that it has been on Amazon Instant Video, it made me happy that I could view it now! :DI highly recommend this video! It is true, in the review's before mine that familiarity of Shakespeares ""Romeo and Juliet"" would help with understanding this movie... but then again it is Shakespeare.. who does not know of this world's most beautifully, enchanting and eloquent love story of two human beings that cannot have each other.. but yet Fate has brought together for reasons of purity, faith, valor, strength, courage, and love."
4,"A bold, brave take on a classic","First, the actors to the man are excellent. They speak the Bard's language smoothly with no sense of embarrasment or awkwardness. I commend Alan Brown for his nearly successful melding of a modern day all boy's military academy with the distant world of Shakespeare. The story is awkward at momments, and you can see where the plaster is still wet where he's tried to create a seamless screenplay that acknowledges the locale of the story and still pay homage to Shakespeare's story. And he was especially wise and brave not to change the pronouns of the play. Juliet and Mercutio are especially attractive and successful in their roles. Not a film for everyone; it's untidy, but it's a must-see for anyone who wants to see how adaptable and truly touching Shakespeare still can be."
2,So so.,I was not particularly affected by this film which really was hard to follow and not really very good. Military cadets are gay. So what!
5,"Shakespeare, Love, and Men","If you enjoy Shakespeare, beautiful men, great acting, and interesting interpretations, of something that has been interpreted almost as many times at the bible, then watch this movie. Someone finally went and did it. What would happen if Romeo and Juliet lived? We still don't know because the film ends right after we learn that they live, but that's okay. I truly enjoyed this film. The writing, most of it Shakespeare, is classic and flawless. The acting, surprisingly mature and moving. The cast, beautiful. The direction, while I don't enjoy the ""abrigedness"" of Shakespeare's work, I think I understand the director's choices and I applaud him for making them and think that he pulled them off."
2,Private Romeo,I just did not like this film.It is for someone that is into tha cind of thing like the ARTS
3,Great Film Quality - Romeo & Juliet as Gay,It was a little disconcerting to me having both Romeo and Juliet played by men and the juxtaposition of a Shakespearean tragedy in a modern military academy was equally odd. I did like the film quality and the actors were very good. I'm not really sure what else to say about it. Perhaps I was looking for something a little more tantalizing.
4,Terrific CD,The video was great and the music was what made it half as good as it was! Now you can get the songs. They are really good. If you liked the movie then you will definitley love this soundtrack!
5,The Lion of Alnwick-A Roaring Good Read!,"""Against a rich backcloth of chivalry, romance, treachery and plague in Medieval England is set the magnificent saga of the Percy family who planted the seeds which grew into the Wars of the Roses.From the war-torn Scottish border to the glitter and intrigue of London, the first Earl of Northumberland is drawn inextricably towards a violent destiny.""This is a wonderful trilogy about the Percy family. Principally, Harry Percy-the confidant of kings and eventual maker and breaker of kings, and his defiant love for the beautifual Margaret Neville. A virtual page-turner of the highest quality! Highly recommended, don't miss this trilogy!"
4,Proof read before selling,"In drill #1 question #29 you are asked to find the amount of the 7 equal monthly payments, it came to $90. but when I picked that answer it told me that I was wrong. It said not enough information was givien because it never told you how many payments. The book as a whole is great, I just wanted some one to know that the problem was there."
3,The 2nd Best Disc in Series,"Like the others in the series, a solid roundup of northern soul/r&b; of the 1960's (not including Motown or Philly) of course. At least on this disc, the best tracks are a little more obscure and not so easily found elsewhere - but overall, still not enough of those tracks, this would've been a top notch 2-disc release but as a 5-disc set, it's nice but hardly a must-have.Like the CD cover, it's professional but not overly exciting nor was all that much creative effort expended in putting these tracks together. It's good, just not great.(for great - check out Zealous Records Presents Soul Sides)So, for the 5 disc release, my actual star rating if decimal points are allowed:Disc 1: 3.50 starsDisc 5: 3.25 starsDisc 2: 2.75 starsDisc 4: 2.75 starsDisc 3: 2.60 stars"
1,Don,Please be very careful with this company. They will send you the wrong order and expect you to pay for the shipping cost and restocking fee even though they are the one that send you the wrong order in the first place. Customer service is not friendly either. You are better off purchasing at Rockler.
4,Great Intro to the Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War,This is a great book if you are interested in Nathaniel Greene or want an introduction to the Southern Theater of the American Revolutionary War.
4,Stand by me movie poster,"Bought this for my son, he really loves the movie. Looks great and came just as expected! Very very satisfied"
3,Nice for small girls,"I bought this for my daughter-in-law, who fortunately is petite with an Aubrey Hepburn-style neck. The chain is beautiful and sturdy, but is shorter than I expected (maybe I didn't read the fine print) and should rightfully be called a choker instead of a necklace. The heart is also smaller than it seems on the screen, but is a lovely stone. This product will look good on a child or a tiny adult."
1,Waste of time,Waste of time add said it fit dodge trucks and it wasn't even close. had to fight to get money back
5,Excellent results with this Kit,"I installed this on my 1999 Tahoe, took about 1 hour to do it, most getting the old stuff off.After the installation, the Tahoe is much snappier and has a great deal of performance. I just installed larger Tires and rims and it is performing better then it ever did on the Stock Rims.You will not be disappointed with this product!"
3,Just Ok...,"I purchased this dvd for my daughter as she is into the art(s) of dancing. I asked her to critique it, her reply was it was just ok. I asked her for details to which she replied, she has great respect for Laurie Ann but was disappointed and expected more. The dance/instructions were not as challenging as she expected. It's ok for someone very new to hip hop dancing."
2,Shut Up Already !,"Gibson is a good dancer and choreographer, and is a decent teacher. But My God...her voice is so GRATING and ANNOYING that I felt like throwing the TV out the window. She sounds like JOAN RIVERS teaching a dance class. I couldn't take it anymore."
5,Love it,When I got it and just sat there and looked at it without interacting I thought ten bucks was too much. But after I got my butt up off the couch and started dancing I realized for a beginner like me it was really intense I am now strting to get the dance moves down and everytime I accomplish them I feel very proud. I am so glad that I got the dvd but that doesnt go without sayin that this is the only dvd you will need to be able to dance well and get into shape for me as a recording artist tring to step my game up I have purchased several other dvd's to get a well rounded dance experience. But I can definitly say that this dvd has ben a great frist addition. Thanks Loriann
2,Horrible,"I would not recommend this product. She doesn't break down the dances using counts, and she moves too fast. You have to keep stopping the dvd and going back to learn the dance. I was really disappointed with this dvd."
3,Just in the middle,"There was quite a bit to be desired in this DVD (a proper warm-up, more repetition for dance steps, less name dropping) but I did like a few things (the style of the steps, the flow of the final set, high energy) so I gave it three stars. I just dance for fun in the morning so there may be more technical reasons for the whys and why-nots of this DVD...this is just an inexperienced persons view."
3,Just ok,"If your a newbie to dance, I think she goes to fast. If your advanced, the moves arent all that."
2,"Does not ""Break it down""","I definately would not recommend this item for beginners who wat to dance. The moves go pretty fast in this DVD and because everything is opposite looking at the tv, its even harder for a beginner. As far as someone whos looking for a good workout, I would not recommend this dvd for that either. There are far too many breaks and far too much talking."
2,Not so much,"Wasn't impressed. When I buy an exercise video or dance video I feel the purpose is to teach you. The fact that she doesn't mirror the moves makes it difficult to learn. Laurie does relie on the fact that you can rewind. The warm up was horrible, a few head rolls and hip movements. I didn't get past the begginers part for a while because it was confusing."
1,Instructor,This video would have been much better if Laurie ann Gibson wasn't so full of herself. I can't bear to use the dvd any more because other than the dancing all she does is talk about herself and how great she is or other people are talking about how great she is.All I care about is the dancing!!!!!
3,fun but no freestyling,bought this product to learn how to dance but the dances are so routine and there are not many different dance steps.
3,it's ok,it's an ok product. laura goes through the routines way too fast 4 my taste. she says u can always pause an replay but u have to replay it from the beginning of the routine. if u practice a lot u will get it but it's not that easy. i'm not sorry 4 making the purchase.
3,A 70s flashback with a new twitch!!,"After reading the reviews, I was a bit hesitant, so I rented it instead. I will say the show is a bit on the bad side, but it does has a good side too. I really like the more youthful look of the 70s that the show has like the bubble gum lamp in her apartment or her VW bug she drives. And the cameos from some Bewitched stars like Dr. Bombay do may a nice little trip back to the 70s. So if you just want to watch something for a night that you have nothing to do watch this!!!!"
4,Entertaining,"After all the negitive reviews, I was very skeptical to buy this. But I said WTH why not! I must say I really enjoyed it. I absoulutly adore Lisa Hartman as Tabitha. She does a very good job. I found it humorous and enjoyful. I guess everyone has thier own opions. Its a real shame that it didnt last longer. it would have been really nice to have more episodes to enjoy, IMO!Now, a lot of people have been saying how better of the series would have benn if it followed the unaired pilot. I have to disagree. I found the alternate pilot kinda boring. I liked Ms.Williams as Tabatha, but the thing I didnt like, in this pilot and the one that aired, is adam. In the unaired pilot I found him annoying and in the series I found him even more annoying LOL. Although I do think the series would have been more interesting had Adam been a warlock, JMO.I hope this review helps you out!"
3,Tabitha,I thought there would be more of Endora and Serena or Aunt Clara in this show. I would have love to seen Darrin and Samantha. It is an alright show but it was nothing that I was use to seeing with the original Bewitch shows
4,Spiders That Crawl..Bats That fly...Silence My Tounge If I'm Telling A Lie.,"First off, let me say that I am a die-hard Bewitched fan. Always have been, always will be. But I remember being dissapointed, as an 11 year old, that Elizabeth Montgomery wasn't going to be on ""Tabitha"". I remember liking the series, but not being enthralled with it as I was it's originator. However as an adult, I can now watch the show and enjoy it for what it was...a charming escape. I wish it had been given a chance is a solid timeslot and allowed to grow on it's own. Maybe not enough time had passed from the original to it's spinoff. I think that most people buying entertainment these days will like this. It view's now like an ""homage"" to ""Bewitched"". And yes, 1970's TV seems far racier now that when I was 11, but it still makes me smile."
4,Silly But Enjoyable! Lisa Hartman-Black is Charming!,I saw Tabitha on TV Land as part of their as part of their corny TV show night hosted by Martin Mull and Fred Willard and it is so silly but enjoyable mainly because of the charming Lisa Hartman-Black. The only character I don't like is Adam because he's a boring drip! A total stuffed shirt! I have been wondering if this hsow would ever make it to DVD and actually I seriously doubted that it would but thank the lucky stars that I was wrong! This would make a great edition to my huge DVD collection!
3,Tabitha review,"A fair remake, borrowing elements from the Bewitched series. Would have been better if Elizabeth Montgomery was involved in the series."
4,Tabitha,"I remember watching the show when it was on in the 70's and I do remember how disappointed I was when it was quickly cancelled. I thought it was a cute funny show, but it was just never given a chance, much like the networks do to shows these days (i.e. Book of Daniel, DAYBREAK) I think if the network had given it a chance and had more Bewitched stars ""visit"", the show may have gotten better. I was so happy when Lisa Hartman moved to the cul-de-sac community of KNOTS LANDING in 1983 though--I love Lisa Hartman-Black. I think she got major talent in singing and acting and loved her as Singer Ciji Dunne and doppelganger Cathy Geary."
4,Lisa Hartman's Old Nose!,"Lisa had her nose done after this series; she is more beautiful now at age 50 than she ever was then. I had her on my flight (I am a Flight Attendant), and she looks twenty years younger than she is."
3,A show with potential and problems,Tabitha in itself was not a bad little tv show but as a spinoff it was a failure. The show centered on a grown up Tabitha at work in the big city and her occasional romantic life. The two Stephens siblings I thought were great and a tiny bit of the charm of the original were present however I had several problems with the show.1.Robert Urichs character made way too unlikeable to be Tabithas love interest2.No where even close to the same premise or scenario that made Bewitched a hit - Tabitha for the most part centered around the workplace. They should have gave Adam a family and featured a little more of him and in combo with a romance between Tabitha and a more likeable Urich from the start.3.except for a brief appearance from Bombay and the Kravitz family no other characters from the original show appeared reallyso Tabitha felt distanced from the original Bewitched and theyshould of ditched the annoying aunt Minerva in favor of someone or something else.
4,excellent cool jazz,"Vince Jones is a master of the genre - cool croony jazz, and he shines on this album. So much so that when he sings a new song, it becomes a standard. Great music, though not much trumpet on this album. Just beautiful, smooth and snappy numbers that will mellow out your hectic nerves or cool out your dinner party. This talented Australian artist has given us a great album; goes well with a good red wine!"
5,Trumpets do talk!,"Vince Jones albums are all unique pieces of great work. My favourite song on this album is the very melodic ""Pablo"", great trumpet play. Well worth it!"
3,Immensely Entertaining fluff,"If you're like me, you bought this because of the Chronicle on the SF channel. It's way different--most importantly, here, the supernatural IS generally debunked, not real.There's not much science in these short, prose driven novels. What the author does do well is write hilarious prose. These novels are so funny that you laugh out loud. He's got a turn of the phrase, a feel for the absurd. By the time you are done, you feel guilty for having had so much fun considering how light the plots are....! Ps. I liked Vampires of Vermont better."
5,More fun and mystery with Savvy Skye,"Like the first book in the series, this is a mystery book with only a touch of science fiction. In fact, there's so little sci fi in this one that it makes me wonder why anyone would put it on the sci fi shelves. It really doesn't matter. What matters is -- Savvy's back! This time Savvy is out to figure out what's driving a whole town mad. The plot involves poison apples, genetic engineering, the CDC, and a cute coworker with more looks than brains. Savvy continues her wry observations about herself and others. It's funny, breezy, and interesting. A great cosy."
2,"Started good, but ended horribly","When I finished this book I wanted to heave it across the room. This author has a VERY bad habit of leaving major issues unresolved. He did it in Monster of Minnesota, and he did it in this one as well. At the end, we aren't even told what happened with the 19 year old girl who is dying! And what about the mayor? He walks in the building during the climax and we never hear from him again! His character pretty much disappears from the story shortly after he appears--and he's not a minor character! The denouement was rushed and left the reader feeling like the author simply lost interest in the story. No wonder this series in now out of print."
2,difficult to turn,"This stroller is rather difficult to manuever when your baby is more than 15 lbs. or so. Now that my baby is 2 (and not very heavy at all), It feels like I have to force the stroller into turns (no, the wheels are not locked :-)) and the stroller seems to be creaky. My sister has the same experience. Rather disappointed, I don't recommend this stroller for this reason."
1,Terrible company,"If you have a problem with your stroller, Inglesina will not stand behind its products. Be aware."
5,Classy Cloe,Cloe is very beutiful and her name is spelled Cloe not Chloe so I hope I helped some of you. She is pretty not ugly...Beutiful eyes...nice outfit...awesome doll...I just don't have her yet but since she's cheap I will get her soon.
2,Work ok,"Flimsy is what I'd say they are. There used to be a different kind they used to make and were a lot stronger. I bend one blade every time I use it, can be bent back, but still a hassle."
3,"Okay Book, Not Really Filling ...","I bought the book after reading the other 5 star reviews.The author describes various items about financial statements. What's really missing is good comprehensive test cases - where he can walk us through applying what was being explained.It was way too much money for what is being offered. I learned much more from MorningStar Classic ""The five rules of successful stock investing"" for a fraction of price."
4,"Regulates your cycle, not a miracle drug.","This stuff really only does one thing - it regulates your menstrual cycle. I had irregular periods and after taking this for a couple of months I was getting my monthly like clockwork. Unfortunately, that didn't turn out to be the reason we weren't getting pregnant, so it didn't solve the bigger problem.I'd recommend it if irregular periods are what's causing your trouble, but otherwise I wouldn't bother."
5,Recommended read for aspiring and the experienced PM,"Well written and easily readable book that offers practical project management tips in an effective format. As you follow the short chapters, different project management issues are covered practically and comprehensively. Although the book was written a while ago it is no less relevant. Arguably the most readable Project Management book and I have read Critical Chain !"
3,Understanding,"One must be sure to keep an open mind for both sides while reading the book, and form your own opinions."
4,Good for late Elementary through Middle School,"I had a lot of trouble finding a study/test taking skills guide aimed at 5th graders. Most were really high school or college level. This one is pretty good because it is designed for the kid to read herself. This is helpful since, at this age, my daughter isn't too keen about taking advice from me, but, reading it in book form makes it acceptable. By 5th grade, the work load is heavier, and those kids that have more or less skated to this point now find they have to study some. When I reviewed some poor math tests with my daughter, it was obvious that she knew the material, but made foolish mistakes because of stress. Learning basic test taking skills is easy and important and not something taught in schools. Highly recommend."
1,"Great show, horrible DVD","Dragnet was a great TV show and I was psyched when I found that it had been released on DVD. Unfortunately the discs didn't play properly in my DVD player. I tried them in my other player and then on my computer and discovered that they paused and skipped in the same places. I returned the set for a new one and had the same problems! I returned the set and got my money back and purchased it from a different store and, whadayaknow, SAME PROBLEMS! I'd love to buy the entire series but since Universal seems to be totally inept in the area of DVDs I doubt I'd risk it. It still surprises me when companies like Universal show such disrespect for their customers by releasing defective products. I eventually found an, er, unauthorized version of the series on DVD which play perfectly. Sergeant Friday would disapprove, I'm sure, but, man, what a great show!"
4,Excellent Series - Finally on DVD!,"Call me old-fashioned, but I'm still just thrilled to be able to put a disk in a player, whenever I want, and watch some of my favorite TV shows. Reading about how some are upset that there is only one radio show, that there are no extras, etc....I can only say that that doesn't bother me in the least. What I was paying for was the First Season of Dragnet - and I now have it and can watch all of the episodes from Season One anytime I want. When I was growing up, to think we would someday have the capability to do that was far-fetched. I'm just glad to have the shows --- and the other stuff? --- whatever they put in extra is nice I suppose, but it's not the extras I have waited years to be able to purchase. Thank you Universal for making this available. I am ANXIOUSLY awaiting Dragnet 1968!"
1,Quality of the media is the problem,"I know that I am late arriving to the technical problem regarding the Universal products. I just wanted to add another return to store report. The product was exghanged but the freeze-up problems just appeard at another spot on the disc. During 2005, I have had similar problems with Adam-12 season number 1 and Hammer Horror Series. All of these of course from Universal. Shame on me for not coming here first once the problems began on the first set. Very sad because the product is great and the transfer is very good."
4,Where are the rest?,"I would love to have the rest of Jack Webb's series. The other seasons of Dragnet, Emergency, Adam 12. Great TV to watch with the kids."
2,"Good Show, Bad DVD's","The same as other reviewer's is that disc 1 side A is defective and I have tried 3 different sets.As was said, where is the quality control?"
3,'Season One' is not 'Number One',"This was actually the weakest season of the 60's version of Dragnet. However, the set is worth buying if only for the classic debut (""The Big LSD"") an unintentionally funny view of the effects of LSD on youth. One kid sticks his head in the ground and tries to eat the bark off a tree, another kid eats paint at a party, and the main culprit ""Blueboy"" paints half his face blue. The rest of the episodes are okay but a bit dry compared to seasons 2 thru 4, when the more human, personal side of Friday and Gannon's characters was introduced."
1,Highly disappointed,"I ordered this set the first week of December. For what ever reason, it took Amazon 3 months to get this HUGE disappointment to me. I thought the $12.99 sale price for any season of any show was pretty good, so I was quick to add it to my Christmas shopping cart. What a mistake. Luckily, this wasn't a gift. $12.99 was quite the over-payment. The ""set"" doesn't even include a list of the Season One shows or titles, release dates, or anything. I love this show but this ""box set"" is a waste."
3,Great show - crappy copy,"Is it possible for someone other than Universal to release this show and do it correctly ??? Dragnet was a fantastic show I loved as a child. It's worth watching again and again, since there's nothing decent to watch on tv these days. Please, someone, release this properly !"
1,"Love the Show, But the DVDs have problems","I grew up watching Dragnet. I was really happy when my wife gave me the DVD set for Christmas. My joy turned to aggravation though as the Discs kept freezing up. And it is not just my DVD player. We have four in the house and it did it in all of them. The discs appear free from scratches and smudges.Sadly the same thing happened with the McMillan & Wife Season One DVD's (another Universal product)I gave my wife.It's obvious Universal is having a problem with the production of DVD's.I did a little checking on the internet and it appears the Adam-12 discs have the same problem.So be warned, if you buy Universal TV series DVD's, there could be problems."
2,I agree with the Universal Studios problems,"I actually bought this item at Best Buy and the salesgirl was kind enough (after two visits) to take the best/undamaged discs for two Dragnet 67 sets and 'make' one good one for me. The physical product/DVDs themselves are awful (scratched, skip, won't play), and it would have been nice to have season two and season one together (that would have been worth the $). I agree, Universal Studios is manufacturing a terrible after market TV product and needs to be told. I love these Dragnet shows from the late 60s (and would like to see more) but what a lousy product (the only DVDs I have ever bought that have done this, even compared to cheap DVDs/on special at the supermarket)."
1,Dragnet 1967-Season 1,"I purchased this collection on 9 January, 2010 and did not try it until today, only to find out there's sound but no picture. All mo other DVD's work fine. I want a replacement, but Amazon gives me a message that it cannot be returned. I'm not worried about a refund, just a DVD set that works!"
5,Love This Show,"Perhaps cause I used to watch this show with my Dad, but I can not get enough of this show. Even watch episodes again, knowing the endings. Love Friday's witty ending remarks and Gannon's quirks.Jack Webb really had a knack for this show. Loved the old BW series too, although Gannon really adds in the newer show. Also love the old radio series - it is done in the same manner - actually the radio show is almost the same. Will have to buy that radio show series for our next long car trip."
2,Defective discs,"We love the old TV program, and the A/V quality is good esp. for 1967, but the 1st disc is noticeably (visually) defective and sure enough, side-A won't play episodes 6 & 7. Side-B won't play at all. Disc-2 seems okay (just 3 episodes on one side of a double-sided disc - go figure). Bonus disc is scratched. Returning the set and will try again. Delivery service was outstanding, and it looks like the return service will be the same. Now, I have to laboriously examine seasons 2-4 . . . uggghhh"
5,GREAT COP SHOW-GREAT PRICE!!!,This really is a no risk purchase-a great show from the 60's and the picture quality is outstanding! Thanks UNIVERSAL for a quality product! BUY IT! You will be STOKED! PEACE
4,If you are a Dragnet fan,"If you are a Dragnet fan, this DVD will remind you why you became one. The segment called ""The Big Interrogation"" includes the classic ""What Is A Cop"" monologue by Jack Webb and is worth the price of the whole DVD."
1,BAD PROGRAMMING,"I was a huge fan of Dragnet in the 1970's and 1980's watching the reruns. At first I wa impressed with this collection, but the dvds froze up on some of the episodes. I contacted amazon and they sent me a brand new copy. I had the same problem on that one as well. This seems to be a common problem on the Television collections. I had the same problem with the Miami Vice collection. I wish the people who are responsible for putting these dvd collections together would do it the right way. I sent the copies back and until amazon can assure me that they have copies that are not effective I will have to do without. I wonder if anyone else is having the same problems."
5,Ani Entertainment Is Good Entertainment :),"I think this is a wonderful book. It captures Ani and her fierce independence. It is not a biography so I am sure not all in it is true. I am reading it to learn about the fans and the music. Ani's personal life is no one's business but her own. All of you waiting for her personal biography are being silly. Her biography is already out there. Her songs are her biography. She chooses what she wants to tell us. I have been a fan of Ani's music since 1995 and know alot about her. I have been to many many of her concerts. This book is entertaining and well written. It's not shakespeare, it's entertainment about an entertainer."
1,Doesn't even deserve 1 star,"The way that the author is trying to capitalize on Ani's name is disgusting. I borrowed this from a friend and am glad to say that none of my money went into this guy's pocket. Terribly written, blatant inaccuracies (song titles, etc), and written without Ani's consent. I think it just plain that the first book written on the life of Ani Difranco is such a piece of trash."
1,the man needs to get his facts straight,"the author threw a bunch of hear say and rumors into book format and sold it. a lot of the so called ""facts"" are blatant fallacies. buy a record, go to her concerts, you'll learn more about her."
1,what the.....?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?,"alright, rafaele if you`re reading these little reviews - i have one question - how did you manage to get that published? it`s the worst pile of misinformation i`ve ever read - please people don`t buy this book - there were so many factual errors in it - if you want to know about ani, just wait for RBR to realease the official bio;)"
3,attn: all ani lovers,ok---well...the book is not the best--but hey..ani didn't write it. grammar problems and mis quotes are scattered throughout the text. some info is actually valid and the book is not as bad as you may think. if you love ani you will probably buy it-just to own it...but if you are buying it for an in-depth explanation of how and why ani is who she is--this book may not be the best buy for you. i suggest SOLO by marc and emma--it is a suberb buy!
1,A disappointing look at an amazing talent,"Okay, I think that Ani rocks... but this book completely does not do her justice. First of all, Raffaele, try getting lyrics right when you quote them. (* I even read a description where it said ""Names, and Dates, and Places"" instead of ""Names, and Dates, and Times"" for the opening song off ""Puddle Dive""! If you can't even get the song titles right, think of how many other factual discrepancies there must be.) Plus, that whole section where he's describing various Ani fans (why they like her, why they've become disillusioned with her, etc.) -- not only was it was ridiculous, it was embarassing! Why would anyone care! I was excited to read this book, because I wanted a little insight into her songs and why they came about, but I am seriously considering returning my copy to the bookstore I work at. I'll leave it to Ani for the last word: ""And everything I do is judged / And they mostly get it wrong, but oh, well."""
3,Shimmer bra lace plus 42 white,Unfortunately it was not a good style for me because I am actually small breasted and the top of the bra sat quite away from the body the cup was too large so I just gave it to a friend
1,junk,"Take a pass on this one, Ladies. It's junk. Extremely poor construction. Love Fifi's items are much better quality. I won't try another brand again."
2,Pretty but too flimsy,I bought the royal blue lace. Bra is beautiful but provides no support. I am a D cup and it was useless.
5,Very good,"This book is one of about 9 books that have come out in the last 9 years or so on the concept of equal parenting. A few others have focused on the long-neglected issue of how adding a paternal child care role helps children.I am sorry to see this book has not received more attention, as it is excellent.I know a number of couples who follow the four-thirds solution, and it has worked really well for their families. My neighbors do this, and their children are really thriving; the boy shows none of the signs of aggression, ADD or Asperger-like problems that some boys seem to struggle with still today and the girl is confident, assertive and shows no issues with body image or self-harm that some girls seem to struggle with still today.I would recommend this book to anyone."
1,The photos in this cd are disappointing.,The photos in this cd are quite disappointing. It was apparently manufactured in 1995. Photo resolution and technology has advanced so much since then that you feel like you are looking through gauze. The descriptions of places and animals are not very complete either.
2,For History and coaster fans AOK for 3D ...P.U.!!!,"What can you say about highly touted 3d effects from a coaster video when the best 3d in the whole show comes form the swings and the carousel? You got ripped,that's what. The Show itself is a pleasant enough kid friendly account about the fastest and tallest coasters at the time but it rarely goes in depth about anything especially the 3d.The Pulfrich system of grey and clear lenses makes anything that moves from left to right 3d to a degree so save the glasses for sports shows and what not untill your bored with them but the coaster film to be shot in true 3D has yet to be made.Dukey"
4,America's Greatest in 3D.....Pt. 2...,"I forgot to mention that Kumba also just shows one view but I was very disappointed that it didn't show the entire coaster or at least from riders point of view, this is one coaster that's not featured much at all, if any other time & would've been nice to see more of it."
3,"Corny, but I really liked it","I watched this video for the first time over a year ago, and I have to say that it could have been a LOT better. I'd like to state a couple disavantages to this DVD that could have been prevented:1) I don't know which TV the glasses included work best for. They didn't really work for mine.2) The sound editors used the same sound effects over and over on almost every ride. I say, that can be irritating. You'll know what I'm talking about when you see this.3) The quality of the video isn't quite perfect either, at least on a few coasters. At least they didn't show the whole ride on Kumba from front row. Overall, the video is average.Overall, this DVD is OK; still recommended for hardcore coaster fans.Well, God Bless!"
2,"Good coasters, bad actors, bad writing","This video brings you fourteen Roller Coasters from all over the United States. The film had its drawbacks and some good features but not many.The good qualities: excellent car-mounted picture quality of the front row of most of the coasters, wide range of coasters shown, and interesting narrative.The bad qualities: cheesy over-done music, irritating narrators with poor writing, no actual front-car view of Kumba, the ?3-D? features are non-existent, and no one seems to recognise the different kinds of inversions there are. A batwing is a batwing, not a cobra roll. There is a difference. I?d give the video one star, but at least they filmed these coasters, you have to give them credit for that."
1,One start is one too many,"In short: What a waste of money. If I didn't view my purchase of this DVD as a joke, I would be sorely disappointed. The so-called 3D effects are anything but stunning and 3D. The audio reminds one of an 8-track and the video could make one sick (due to poor quality). All in all, the 3D does not work, audio and video are poor, and why not visit a real theme park rather than expirence it vicariously on DVD"
1,disappointing 3D effects,"I was anticipating a 3D experience with the roller coaster rides and I was disappointed. The commentary by the presenters before the coaster ride was irritatingly long. The 3D effects were minimal and sometimes not noticeable at all. I put the glasses on my mother, and she couldn't see any difference between 2D and what was supposed to be 3D. There were some wildlife shots which proved to be more effective in 3D. If one is to compare this 3D movie with something like IMAX, then don't. I tried the CD on a wide flatscreen 32"" TV and also on my computer monitor. Neither gave the 3D effect I was expecting. A waste of money."
3,"OKAY, BUT NOT TOO GOOD","I think this video was okay. There were some good things,and bad things.GOOD THINGS1)There was great front seat views from the ride.2) The camara stayed still,giving the a particulary smooth feel to it.3) They used lots of good coasters.BAD THINGS:1) The narrators were bad actors and said really strange and cheesy things. (""Ahh...I'll get you a glass of warm milk."")2) The music was cheesy and way to overdone.3) In almost every ride, you heard a guy go ""YEE-HAA!!!!!!""4) The sound editors did a bad job, using sounds over and over.It gets a little irritating, if you know what I mean.Overall, this video is okay. But it isnt for hardcore roller coaster enthusiests,its for kids."
3,Roller Coaster Thrills in 3-D ... sort of.,"It should be noted that this is not true 3-D - It's the type where the glasses have one dark lens, making objects that move from left to right seem to pop into the foreground. It works during some of the introduction shots, but has little effect during the ""ride"" itself. It's still fun on a really big screen, but leave the glasses in the box (the picture looks normal without them)."
2,"Good, but bad at the same time","This video brings you fourteen Roller Coasters from all over the United States. The film had its drawbacks and some good features but not many. The good qualities: excellent car-mounted picture quality of the front row of most of the coasters, wide range of coasters shown, and interesting narrative. The bad qualities: Why anyone would want to film an indoor Roller Coaster (in the dark) is beyond me (if you want to see the exact same coaster, but outside, see the third video in this series), two of the coasters had post-production movement shadows added, which really [messed] up the entire trip, Mantis never really had the front-car view, and the ?3-D? features are non-existent."
2,Mild Amusement,"World's Greatest Rollercoaster Thrills was a letdown. Perhaps because I saw America's Greatest Rollercoaster Thrills: The Ultimate Scream Machines prior to this. Anyway, the footage on some of the coasters is good. For example, Big Dipper. It was a nice pov and edited wide shots. However, I found some of the shots to be fuzzy, such as on The Dragon. I was very excited to find that Dragon Khan was on this video, but I found the footage to be less than prime. They barely showed anything of the Corkscrew at Sea World Australia, no front-seat shot AT ALL. That disappointed me. Sometimes, they would show shot of the camera sideways looking out of the coaster and that became incredibly nauseating. The 3-D effect was not noticeable. However, for content, it was a good DVD. I just wouldn't recommend it. Purchase America's Greatest Rollercoaster Thrills: The Ultimate Scream Machines instead."
3,"This is for kids, not dvd fans!","This is a fun documentary to watch..... once. Don't expect IMAX or so. Nevertheless, the final chapter (Front car center) brings you the whole tour summarized as 18 or so rides from the passenger's view, which will surely delight your kids every now and then. The 3D effect works only sometimes and the video quality is irregular. Be aware that this is not stuff for dvd maniacs but for kids."
5,OHHHHHH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you are seeking for an a mazing roller coaster video, search no further!!! This movie is da bo mb. The roller coasters are a great range of type and style. The 3d effect is awesom e. ENJOY!!!"
1,disapointed,this item arrived with several pieces broken. unfortunately it would have cost more for me to return.
2,Just a disappointing roller coaster video!,"This video was poorly filmed with either the camera being too low on the coaster train, the lighting too dark to even see the coaster track, and two coasters, Wild Thing and the Great Nor'easter were filmed with a special color and in slow motion which ruined the effect. What were the producers or film makers thinking? If they make a third coaster video, I hope they do not film it like this one, otherwise I will not buy it."
2,Roller Coaster Thrills Volume II Disappointing,"Yes, I said it. This video was just a disappointment.For many reasons, America's Greatest Roller Coaster Thrills II in 3-D (yeah, right!) just didn't measure up to my expectations. It didn't even show some of the rides clearly but instead put some editing trick on the footage to make it totally unviewable. Also, the producers (or whoever) put cheesy music on during every single ride. I found this highly irritating.Obviously, I cannot recommend this video. I am very disappointed with it, and feel that the producers had good material and then messed everything up. END"
3,Hang on to Volume 1 !!,"The P.O.V footage on the second volume of this series was highly desapointing since it was shoot with added special visual FX that really doesn't help the viewer to ""enjoy and live the excitement""...still the High Roller footage of the Las Vegas tower saved the show !"
4,"If You Are A Roller Coaster Junkie, Than Look No Further!","America's Greatest Roller Coaster Thrills In 3-D is a tour de force of some of the most fearsome wooden and steel beasts throughout the country. Fans of coaster riding will love the 3-D effect. While not compatable with riding the real thing, it's a helpful reminder of why so many of us love a great, fast, thrill-filled ride. This DVD is great fun, and while the hosts are at times annoying, it's still one of the most fun DVDs you'll ever watch. Be sure to check out Volume 2 as well...it ditches the hosts and improves on this volumes occasional quirkiness."
3,"Good DVD,Bad effects","This DVD had good roller coasters,but you couldn't see any 3-D. Altough there are roller coasters from Hong Kong,England,Las Vegas,NA,Austrilia,and more,this DVD isn't 3-D."
3,Not great,"Having owned the first two videos in the series, I was suprised by the lack of quality. Some of the first person coaster rides are ruined by stupid effects, others by the setting sun, and the choices are strange (why film a coaster that's in the dark? ) But, if you're a coaster enthusiast, you'll like it nonetheless."
1,what a disappointment!,"Well, I really was excited about getting this dvd - which is, here in germany, NOT easy! - and then... The quality of the video- and adiosignals on that dvd are definitely not worth to be mentioned at all; are they even digital??? The technology is much farer than this dvd offers, and the rides in the front cab aren't even full-length, only too often there are cuts, so that ""america's greatest roller coasters"" are NO thrill to look at, at least not on that dvd. By the way, is there ANYbody out there who could frankly say the 3d-effect works???Really, I just love roller coasters, but this dvd is really nuts. sorry."
2,Misleading Description,"The description for this items suggests that it works independently to provide POE, but that isn't the case. It requires a compatible D-Link switch. I can't vouch for the functionality of this item because it wouldn't work with my existing network equipment, so I had to send it back for a refund."
3,For D-Link Equip Only?,"I'm with the other reviewer, this is not a standard POE injector, it is designed to work with D-Link equipment it seems, the description needs to be better. I gave it 3 stars because I don't know how well it would work if I could use it. It does *not* come with a AC adapter, it assumes there is power on the ethernet and breaks it back down into just enet and just power -- it's the OPPOSITE of a power injector. Anyway, maybe I'm wrong, I messed with it for 5 minutes and then a glance at the manual made it seem like a lost cause so back to the jungle it goes!"
2,Not what I expected...,The shirt seemed fine until you wash it. The shirt is crooked and when you put the shirt on the print is slanted - crooked because the shirt was made wrong. I am highly disappointed in the company that made this shirt.
3,Yes and no,"The software is really impressive but all the add ons are geared toward a more conservative christian viewpoint. Although I respect it, I don't share it. I would have ordered the smaller package and just added the books that I needed. I wished they would have indicated their leanings."
2,disapointed Husband,My Husband bought this hoodie wore it once then washed it and it shrunk a lot (washed it on cold) so now I have a new WMU hoodie but hubby is out one.
2,disappointing,"If you enjoy beautiful photography for its own sake, this book is gorgeous; but if you want to see photographs of Mexican houses, interiors and folkcrafts, save your money. A big disappointment."
5,Color en Mexico,The pictures are great but I wanted the English version - how can I get that? You do not indicate which language it is written in on your order form. I have seen the English version and assumed that this was what I had ordered. I will be returning this one (in spanish) - how can I get an English version
4,Text study for the INTELLIGENT beginner!,"What's the difference between ""Mishna"" and ""Midrash""? Is ""Talmud"" the same as ""Gemara""? What's a ""Tanach""?If you're just getting started in Judaism, it's easy to get bogged down with terminology. There are lots of books on each of these subjects, but very few that cover ALL the classic Jewish sources.This book provides an excellent introduction, not only to WHAT the texts are, but HOW they are used and studied. Holtz takes us on a step by step journey through a sample section of each text, demonstrating, in a beginner-friendly way, the ways that scholars derive modern meaning from ancient wisdom.Holtz never condescends -- he makes the rare assumption that the reader is highly intelligent, well-read in other areas and has become interested in learning more about Judaism. Very much recommended before delving deeper into any one Jewish text."
5,A wonderful introduction to rabbinic literature and Judaism,"This work presents chapters on all areas of Jewish and rabbinic literature, by ten experts in Jewish rabbinic works. They are not just knowledgeable, but they are also good writers.It presents a readable explanation and overview of all the basic Jewish texts, including the Torah, the Tanakh (Bible), the Mishna and both Talmuds. That's right, there are two Talmuds: The Bavli, from Babylon, and the Yerushalmi, from Israel. This book also covers Jewish philosophical writings, Kabbalah [Jewish mysticism], Hasidic writings and the Siddur [prayerbook]."
4,Judaism 101!,"This book is a wonderful introduction to Judaism as a whole. It covers a wide range of topics from biblical literature, to the Zohar. Each chapter is clear and well documented. If you are interested in learning about Judaism, or Jewish and wanting to learn more check it out."
4,Not Just For Jews,"This book may be quite academic and ""dry"" in places. However, it provides a wonderful historical and functional perspective of the oldest of the literature of the Judeo-Christian tradition. You don't need to be a ""Bible scholar"" to appreciate this work."
4,KINDLE - NO PAGE NUMBERS!,"***The book is good, but I'm using it for a class, and the Kindle doesn't have page numbers!*** No pages numbers in Kindle but...I can search for specific phrases and words, and the Kindle will jump me to that location.But if I am not in class, I have no idea what page I am on!!"
5,Best book I've found on AS yet,Having been diagnosed with AS I have been reading many books on the subject. I found this one the best so far. My wife also found the book beneficial and it has helped us to understand why we see things differently in some situations and how this impacts on our interactions.
5,"Well researched, helpful & informative book","I have read this book with avid interest after reading Maxine Aston's first work. As the NT partner of an Asperger relationship, I can equate on a personal level with the writers findings and examples and find it a relief to realise that I am not going mad and am not alone. There are books available that tell the story from an Asperger point of view but not many that incorporate the NT perspective and are based on research. A brilliant piece of work. I can HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who is in a NT/AS relationship as being a light in the darkness."
3,Somewhat helpful,"I was really looking for a book that was directed toward helping an adult with Asperger's navigate through romantic relationships. This book was more focused on helping the neurotypical understand an Aspie mate. I think it was helpful for those readers in the latter category, but not really what I was looking for."
2,Not the best,"This book offers some examples of problems that a therapist has seen in clients. I found some of her examples (without enough explanations) calloused and insulting to AS people (and I'm NT). It offers little to any REAL advice about how to make a relationship between an NT/AS person work or even how to truly understand your partner.If you're the NT side of an NT/AS relationship, I'd recommend ""Asperger Syndrome and Long-Term Relationships"" which was written WITH LOVE by an NT woman who is actually married to a man with AS."
5,We absolutely LOVE Baby Nursery!,"My youngest son is 8 months old and sits attentively watching the entire show every time I play it. Though he has other baby videos, this one consistently seems to keep his attention best. And my older son, who's 2 1/2 years old, likes to watch too. (Interestingly, there's an option to play this video either with or without animations. They say that the youngest babies like to watch only ""real world"" toys -- but as kids get older, they begin to like watching animations also. I don't know about other families - but that's definitely been true for my boys.) There's also a ""Parent Nursery"" section for parents to watch. It talks about how parents can teach reading, math, language and music concepts to their children at a very young age, in a fun and encouraging way (not at all ""pushy""), which I found very informative. I try my best to be as active as possible with my kids, and Baby and Parent Nursery is a big help. I highly recommend this DVD."
4,Great Gift,"I received this DVD as a gift from one of my co-workers, who swears by the series. She guaranteed my son would love it. We play it once a day, and without fail, he is really taken with the many colorful toys and happy music. This was a really great gift. Though, I have to say, even though the music in this one is better than most infant DVDs, it still is nice to have a variety as a mom."
2,eh,"I bought this after reading the reviews. I have 7 month old triplets who are captivated with all 9 of the Baby Einstein videos I own, no matter what age group they are for.This video did not produce that affect. It is pretty much a low budget BE knock-off, but what's missing is the puppet shows, which my babies love.These have computer animated animals and children's songs that are great... but must be targeted for older babies, because 3 out of 3 of my babies do not pay attention to those. I am hoping they will like this video once the girls reach 1 year old."
2,not 20 mil candle power,"i have a 1,000,000 candle power light i bought 10 or 15 years ago that is as bright as this one, this one does have a slightly wider beam because its 2 lights, but the second light doesnt extend the distance, just makes it wider.its an average light so 3 stars but i subtract a star for its price."
4,high power,This is the light you want for super bright light and long distance viewing. I scare off the coyotes with just a flash of this baby. The charge lasts much longer than I expected it to also. Just be warned... it is heavy
3,"meh.....its ok, but i've seen better.","this light only goes for about 20 minutes or a bit less actually on a full charge before it starts to dull out, I've got a vector one that goes for about an hour and 15 minutes before it starts to dull out, but then again the price is much different, the B&D is $80 and the Vector was $100 but was still 20 million candlepower. if its brandname, go with B&D, if its duration, go with vector, either way both lights are made by the same factory just different investors."
5,black and decker 20 mill light,"just a great light,I use it out in the desert at night.lights up like a b29 landing. I couldn't ask for anything better, I just love it. only problem is, every one wants to use it. larry [ole] olson las vegas nv"
3,Good Buy,"Product was satisfactory. I wasn't impressed with the weight of the product, but it's performance prooved to be just under what I had expected. Overall though, this is a great spotlight and is worth the buy."
1,Not As Advertised,"I like strong spotlights. I purchased the 20 million candlepower Vector expecting great things. I was very disappointed to see the beam was nowhere as bright as my 10 million candlepower spotlight. When I complained to the manufacturer, they replied that ""brightness was a matter of personal oppinion."" What a stupid response. That is akin to saying that a 100 watt light bulb is no brighter than a 50 watt light bulb. Careful of this product, you will be disappointed."
1,Not Impressed,"Product appeared to have been used out of the box... and the housing was cracked. The light output was all over the place and no direct beam. That I did not care for. Extremely heavy and bulky. If you like carrying around an automobile light with the housing then this light will please you. Although, if you prefer exact lumen output, then you will be disappointed with this."
5,Most powerful light on you will find,"Wow! When you turn this spotlight on, it is incredible!Keep in mind, though, the reason it is so powerful is dual headlights, so to speak. Two side by side lamps will always be more powerful. But, that ends up as a feature to go to one lamp to save power.You will also like the car lighter output socket, which allows external devices to be powered. Works well for camping trips."
5,"Fishers & Foxes & Coyotes, Oh My! Now, I can see what's lurking out there...","I needed something bright and strong enough to clearly show what's out in the bushes and what's up in the trees. (Fishers climb trees.) I live in a spot that's not extremely rural, but every now and then a stray wild animal comes around, and it's dark, here. At night, it can be hard to know if it's just the neighbor's cat or something potentially more threatening, if you can hear the rustling of the leaves and grass but not see what's there.I am very happy with this light, and I've used it going between house and car several times in the dark. (So far, so good -- not too much to see!) I like that there's the lower-powered 'normal' light, too, above the floodlights, so that if I just need that, I've got it.Yes, this light is a bit heavy, but, then again, it's got some power behind it. And, it's not awkard to move around or use. the attachable strap can help, for one thing."
5,Amazing Output!!! Flashlight Junkies Dream come true!!,ProsThis thing puts out an ungodly amount of light.ConsIts bigIts heavyIt takes a long time to charge.the switches are not convenient( but I see why they designed it that way.)The Throw pattern is a little uneven.The pro outweighs the cons. Buy this light if you want the the brightest light on the block.
1,Horrible flashlight,"Oh my god. This is the worst flashlight I've ever owned. Making it worse, its the most expensive one too. This damn thing cost me about $70, and it works like crap. It is extremely large and heavy, and the pictures here don't really convey just how big and heavy this flashlight is. Unless you want a workout out you are not going to be holding or carrying this around for very long.This thing takes forever to charge and on top of that it loses its charge even when not in use. Even on a full charge this damn thing only lasted about 20 minutes, losing half or more of its brightness in the first 5 to 10 minutes before going completely dead. The buttons are difficult to push and this thing is extremely cumbersome to handle. The worst part is I didn't even find it to be bright when fully charged."
5,What An Excellent Read!,"I've read all of Colleen Coble's books and I have to say, this one blew me away! Using a protagonist with a handicap was a stroke of genius. . .makes you root for the heroine all the more. And the surprise appearance of some of Ms. Coble's favorites was a welcome delight. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves romantic suspense--you won't be sorry!"
3,Alaska Twilight O K,"I probably should not review this book because it is a romance and romance novels are not ""my cup of tea."" I knew that, of course, but I decided to try the romance genre again to see if I might like it better now that I am (much) older. The book is OK but if I had to choose between romance and mystery I would choose mystery every tiime. If you like romance novels read this! If you prefer another genre, read something else."
3,Surprising!,"i haven't read a lot of colleen coble because i don't particularly like suspense books. But, i liked this one surprisingly!! i thought i had figured it out half way through but ended up being wrong. i'm not saying it's one of my favorite books but i really did enjoy reading it and would reccommend it to anyone considering reading it."
4,Bear facts,I love Coble's books. She always has a great story and characters. This was a very good read. The intrusion of humans on bear domains shows the tragic of the destruction of these animals and the stupidity of humans. If this was the intent of the author the message came in loud and clear. I would recommend this book for anyone not just for animal lovers.
5,Great buy,low cost and in good condition just like i like it. This is a great read and i'm happy to find i could buy it. If you want a new athour coleen coble is the way to go.
5,romance/suspense book lover,"Awesome. Couldn't put it down. The romance, suspense, murders, grizzlie bears, Alaskan wilderness...loved it all. Next book please?I'm a big fan of Dee Henderson's O'Malley Series and this was even more exciting. You won't be able to put it down."
4,Small Surprise!,"Wow, what fun! This little book at first glance appears to be underwhelming and gives the feeling that you may regret reading it when finished. This couldn't be any far from the truth. What a great surprise and great read. I'm not sure how well this fits into Batman canon now, but it was very enjoyable. It's basically one big story arc of someone trying to destroy batman piece by piece while he and Robin race to find the mastermind behind it all. Along the way they dive into the orgin stories of so many characters in this short book. Batman obviously, Robin, Joker, Two Face, Jim Gordon, even Alfred, Joe Chill, Batgirl, and Lucius Fox! The only thing preventing it from a five star is the main story arc feels unnecessary and it's pretty obvious who the guilty party is halfway through. I would highly recommend this however and I can't believe how cheap it is either!"
3,An okay read...some interesting stuff,"Saw this in Wal-Mart and picked it up. It's a pretty good story and re-telling of the Batman origin. I have always loved the post-crisis Batman, but reading the pre-crisis origin for Batman was pretty fascinating. The only downside was the black and white art, and the dialogue was very out of date. But for a story that cost a little over three dollars, I'm not complaining."
5,"Excellent compilation album, covers all the years","First off, this is one of the best spanning collections of any bands works seen around. This starts with songs from all of their releases except for the ""back in the streets"" release. This covers all of the lynch classic line up years through the reb beach comeback album ""erase the slate"" to the new ""hell to pay"" album. This misses none of the major hits, and gets some of the fan favorites also. The re-mastering is good, but does make small snippits of some of the intros ect...as noted by others before, but not a big deal to me, overall it's all intact. This is a relatively good value, and could be an almost all inclusive for a fan who is looking for just one dokken album to have. I recommend all of them, but really is a ""greatest hits""."
5,As good as it gets!,"If you love Dokken?, then you'll love this release. It basically takes you from beginning to end and pretty well covers all the tunes you want to hear. Yes with any greatest hit's package, it's missing some stuff, but for the most part it's all here.The remastering sounds fantastic and the tunes rock bid time. A lot of the 80's stuff gets trashed for being to radio friendly, but the fact is, metal was number one in the 80's and bands like Dokken are the ones who brought attention to this style of music.Nuff said!!"
3,partially okay,"I really don't like live albums because the richness of the sound is lost, thankfully only a few songs on the cds are live. I bought this as my original cd from 20 years is wearing out. Should have purchased the same cd."
5,Amazing read!,"I am not a big reader but when i picked this book up, I couldn't put it down. It shows two boys and their struggle with their sexuality. The character James, was such a real down to earth character. The whole book keeps you thinking wether or not Link and James are gay, or if their in love. It was a great read! Highly recommended!!!"
3,"""My Heartbeat""","My Heatbeat tossed around a lot of issues. I will have to read it again but towards the end I really wasn't sure what was going on because Link implied a lot about his sexuality but I never did figure out whether he was gay or not. The dialouge was ok but the McConell's and James alike spoke differently than everyday people did and thus, made some parts a bit unbelievable. I liked the feel of the book and I enjoyed reading it."
3,Not the most pleasant read...,"When I first chose this book I thought finally, a new twist to the boring old love story! But towards the end the book was agonizing and it almost felt like the author abandoned her characters. It felt like Link was finally being true to himself when all of a sudden James sleeps with Link's 14 year old sister and ISN'T gay anymore? What about Link? How does he feel? It was never said and the ending felt so sloppy. I guess the biggest problem for me was the characters never stayed true to who they are and everything felt so strained at the end. Not a pleasant read to me but loved the concept and we should defiantly have more stories about these subjects."
2,absolutely awful,"Uh, did we all read the same book? Cause I got an entirely different impression. First of all, Ellen, the 14-year-old sounds like a 34 year old trapped in a 14-year-old's body. She and her whole family are unbearably pretentious. The mother is very comfortable with her son being gay, which is not realistic. One of the boys knows he's gay but then turns straight just like that. The author sets up the relationship with the two boys, then sets up one with the girl and a boy and then lets the whole thing drop at the end. The sex scene seemed like it was tagged on as an afterthought. I just felt very led on by this book, then very disapointed and I never emotionally connected to any of the characters."
3,"Cursory and limited, but somewhat sufficient for travel","This book does what most of the Lonely Planet guides do best: provides clear, personalized reviews of places to stay, eat and explore wherever your destination may be. However, LP Tibet focuses mostly on Central Tibet and the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR), with very little info and inadequate maps for what was Kham and Amdo (now contained in Sichuan and Qinghai provinces). This is where other Tibet guides, Gyurmed Dorje's Footprint edition in particular, shine. LP Tibet will get you around the TAR comfortably, but lacks the depth of information and regional exploration required for more intensive and insightful travel there.For the most extensive discussions of religious sites (but DO NOT USE these routes and maps!), try to find the ""Tibet Handbook"" by Victor Chan (out of print). Also, Keith Dowman's ""The Power Places of Central Tibet"" provides excellent, traditional descriptions of Tibetan sacred sites."
5,Lost in Lhasa,"Thanks again for the Lonely Planet. This guide book was a great help for my trip to Tibel via China (summer 1999). It has alot of information about Lhasa and many of the cities. Please do not leave home without this book. From North Carolina to Tibet, no problem, with the help of the Lonely Planet. A rewarding and safe trip. My best advice came form a monk in Tibet ""Walk Slowly"". If anyone needs any help planning this trip please write,you should go...."
1,Not good on Kindle - should have ordered book!,I ordered this on my kindle so I would have to haul heavy books while traveling - transfer to kindle is awful - can't read maps - information is difficult to find - needs a clear index.
3,Overall OK,"The travel guide seems OK, providing the basic information, but nothing more. I am really surprised by the lack of photos (there are photos for the 20 top experiences) even though the back cover says 'inspirational photos.' The other glaring shortcoming is the lack of a table of contents. Yes, the index works, but a table of contents would help greatly.That said, there are very nice entries for many of the monasteries I plan on visiting."
5,Lonely Planet Tibet,"The book was an invaluable resource of recent information about Tibet -- from weather, tours, customs, etiquette."
4,Lonly planet Tibet,"I placed an order for lonly planet Tibet 20th April,2012, I have yet to receive this book. I am unable to review this book as have i have not read it."
3,SINGING?,"I bought all of Williams' books at once and, for some reason, started with THE SINGING. The first section impressed me but then the other 3 sections went f l a t. The second section looks like a bad attempt at using the ghazal as a (new) form. After that, with the exception, maybe, of ""In The Forest"", f l a t. I've gone back to NEW & SELECTED and it's better. But THE SINGING is not a must-have."
1,check the boxes,Received 6 boxes and they only contained 1000 nails per box be sure they don't cheat you they should contain 1500
4,A very good book for the beginner and intermediate breeder.,"Very informative book for the beginner and not so beginner.Takes you into understandable detail about breeding and genetics of budgerigars.Though the book is a bit outdated(78)and doesn't cover the newer mutations(such as spangles)it is still quite informative.There are color photos for identifying the different color types,and BW photos of the different stages of the chicks.I would recommend this book to a beginner breeder."
4,Redesigning HR for Strategic Advantage,"this is a fabulous book that highlights a very underlooked area...one of my favorite reads this year....too frequently, managers do not realize the huge amount of value that can be realized through a well-run hr department...no matter how great the business, without execution nothing matters....Tony Miller does a great job of highlighting how HR fits at the center of an organization, its importance, and how HR can help a company obtain its goals...he draws upon a number of cases to help illustrate how to both build an HR department and improve an exisiting one....i strongly suggest this book for HR execs, managers and students who are fascinated with the study of business"
1,WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!,"I ordered an item thought I ordered 2, asked if I could order the same item with free shippping since my shipping was 3 times the amount of the cookie cutter and was totally brushed off you can find it cheaper on another web site thats where i took my business!"
5,Better than I could have imagined!,"This compendium gives a wonderful insight into the Egypt of the Peabody-Emerson's era. It's filled with images, details, essays on culture, fashion, even child rearing in the Victorian era. An absolute ""must have"" for any Peabodyphiles out there."
5,egypt of the emerson era,"What an informative and delightful addition to the Amelia Peabody Saga. And to begin it with the long lost thoughts and musings of Emerson himself!Those of us intrigued by all things Egyptological, Victorian/Edwardian and the Great War, cannot be but pleased bythe presentation of so much interesting information, combined with an abundance of antique imagery. Now we can see theShepherds Hotel terrace of Ms. Peters verbal depiction, as well as the streets and lanes of Cairo and the other views and vistasof the Emerson Era.And was it fun or what, ""locating"" the pictures used in thePeople of the Journals section? Toddler Amelia in spats!The youthful Emerson brothers, including an airbrushedindication of Radcliff's famous cleft. And who would havethought Enid Debenham was such a fox!But the very best image is of,( whom else?) Ramses, in asailor suit, eating an apple (or is it a sweet?) whilereading undoubtedly, the Koptische Grammatik mit Chrestomathie."
4,For Small Heads,"I bought the medium, thinking that I have an average head size. But this must be made by shrunken head workers, or maybe children in China ? All I can say is that it is tight ! I am returning it to get a large. If you have a big head, look at a different product !Other than that, it appears to be well made, and I like that there is no velcro strap - it's all one piece. I've always had good luck with Body Glove stuff - for a mid price range company, their products are decent."
2,too tight!,"tOO TIGHT! COULDNT EVEN FIT THE SIZE ""SMALL"" PAST MY PETITE 10YR OLDS HEAD! WASTE OF MONEY, WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN :("
3,"Fits funny, thin material","I bought this to replace an old hood for surfing on cold winter days. I wasn't aware this hood is pretty thin (I guess 1mm), and it fits me funny. I saw the other reviews seemed to indicate to get a bigger size than you might otherwise, and since I have a big head, I got a large. On one hand, the hood feels like it might be a bit too big for my head. On the other hand, the hole for my face feels a bit small, and keeps coming down over my eyes. So it just doesn't fit me well, not sure if it might fit other people better. I think next time I'll just go to my local surf shop and make sure I like the fit and thickness.ADDED COMMENTS: I ended up buying a Rip Curl hood at a local surfshop for around $30. Much thicker material, much better fit. In fact, every hood I tried fit much better than this hood."
4,Warm,"Bought at a great price via Amazon. Was fairly thin as expected and described. Used for surfing in RI in April, very cold windy conditions. Head stayed warm and dry, fit well, would recomend!"
1,We weren't so lucky.,"My 28 month old wanted a choo choo for Christmas, so we decided on this one to put around the tree. We set it up easliy on Christmas Eve and we were very pleased with our test run. On Christmas Day, we were planning on having it running when my daughter came out to see what Santa brought her, but it wouldn't work. When we opened up the batttery compartment, all six of the C batteries had split. We have never seen anything like this and are lucky that we didn't have a fire. My daughter saw it wasn't running and said choo choo broke. What a bummer for us. I am torn on whether we find another train or exchange this one since it seems many of you have ran it a while without any thing like this happening."
2,Piece of junk....,"My three year old son loves this train. As for me, I am constantly having to put it back on the tracks, it's horribly loud, the gears inside it slip constantly, causing it to get stuck & the slightest bump separates the tracks. We bought it last year to put under our tree. It drove me crazy all through the holidays & I didn't plan to put it out this year. Well, my son has started talking about it & getting excited, so we got it out today. I thought it might be better this year, since he's older & can fix it himself, but it's just as bad or worse. It seems like the gears are slipping worse this year. I've had it up for about an hour & I'm already ready to throw it in the trash. I'm on here now looking for a new one!"
4,Oiled it,This is a good product. I took some oil to the wheels and the friction noise quieted. The sound track is loud and long but my grandson loves it.
4,Great starter train set,"My mother-in-law got this set for our son six years ago and he has played vigorously with it over the years -- it's still running! The first few years I would put it away with the Christmas decorations, but as he got older it kept coming out during the year. We've played with it during the year, took it to share day for class, ran the train endlessly over the carpet, making terrible gear sounds, but no harm done. I covered the speaker with clear packing tape to mute the sound because it is LOUD, but I think that's why my boy loves it so much. We have rules -- like no sound before 8am -- and we set limits. The headlight is special and overall this has been a great set for him to abuse before we get a ""nice one"" in a few years. It's not high quality - just durable plastic. But lots of fun for the kids. The yellow car has a door that slides open and he loves to stick various toys inside there. One of his top 3 all-time favorite toys ever."
5,Great train for the money (in 1999),"When you see reviews that state this is a good train for the money, they don't mean $300. I bought this train over 10 years ago for less than $50. It still works great. I suggest using silicone spray lubricant on the wheels and other squeaky moving parts. These inexpensive battery operated giant plastic trains are great for under the tree."
4,not a bad little train for the price,if you are looking for a year round train you might want to spend a little more and get a better trainbut if your looking for something for around the treethis is a great deal it is a bit noisy but you get used to it or shut it offwe found that the front wheels derailed alot so we just unscrewed them and it runs fineour 2 year old loves it
2,"Right covers, wrong movie","Same mis-labeled DVD as reported by others. Correct cover on box and DVD but ""The Mystery of Mr. Wong"" is the movie on the disc. Amazon issued a refund on return. Now - how long before I dare order again to insure I get the correct movie. ""A Thousand Clowns"" is a wonderful film."
1,Bor .... ing !,"One of the few movies I walked out on when it played in the theater. Could never figure out the reason for Balsam's character who pops in and out at various times for no apparent reason. It doesn't even deserve one star, but there is no zero star rating. Save your time and money."
5,A Terrific Movie,A heart warming film that does just that. Without being icky and bogged down with cheap sentiment. A terrific movie with a top notch cast. This film delivers on every level. Not the type of film I buy/collect but one that is so good. In its case I made an exception. So its right in there with my film noir/si fi/horror/cult etc.It is indeed a rare pleasure. Try it. You will enjoy it.
5,The movie that changed my life.,"I agree with P Snyder. This movie changed my life. For years my answering machine asked, ""Is this someone with good news or money?"" I've always had a real job but this movie has allowed me to shed many of the pressures my peers suffer. I own 2 VHS copies and hope I can get a DVD before VHS goes the way of Beta Max and 8 track."
5,The classic of comedy,Not only funny - this movie can teach you the art of comedy! Classic and indispensable to the theater artist and student of comedy.
1,Narrated in Spanish - but with an American accent,"ENGLISH¡Qué lástima! (What a pity!) Yes, this video is narrated in Spanish, but unfortunately the narrator has a very strong American accent. Don't waste your money on this video. I applaud the producer's desire to serve children who are learning the language, but this effort failed.SPANISH¡Qué lástima! Este video sí está narrado en español, pero desafortunadamente el narrador tiene un acento americano muy fuerte. No pierdas tu dinero en este video. Aplaudo el deseo del productor de servir a los niños que estén aprendiendo el idioma, pero este esfuerzo fracasó."
2,Searching for the stoic Indian,"I compliment the author for the amount of work put into this book and the attempt to represent shamanism. However, it is rather patronizing in its presentation."
4,Shrubs - lots of pictures but way too large,"I am a visual learner so this shrub key really worked for me. I appreciated being able to identify shrubs based on the twigs, buds, thorns etc. The one downside is the size of the book - it is very large, and not one I particularly want to carry with me while hiking."
4,Very informational,I received the book promptly and have found it to be very helpful for identifying plants.
4,Just good neo soul...,"I came upon Ms. James by accident actually and was thorougly surprised. This disc is just good neo soul to sit back and chill to right after you get home from work; or if its late at night say after midnight, you'd pop this in immmediately. Amazingly enough the song that stands out to me is her remake. ""Don't Speak"" was unexpected. When I first saw it on the disc I thought it was a song that happened to have the same title but I was wrong; and I'm glad I was wrong! Her rendition of ""Don't Speak"" will blow you away. Her approach to this song is and was very unique and refreshing. Leela has a very smooth and soulful voice that you can listen to day in and day out without fail. I'm already looking forward to her sophmore project."
2,Leela James CD,"Ms. James has a beautiful voice but I really didn't like the arrangements of the music. After listening to the CD multiple times I decided I didn't like it and gave it to one of my co-workers, who did."
3,Stands Out From the Crowd of phony Soul sistahs!!,"LOVE Miss Leela James!Give Leela some SERIOUSLY GOOD material, and then maybe we could talk about bringing authentic soul music back from the dead. Meanwhile.. we're being offered fake ""soul"" from imposters like Joss Stone, when in fact, Leela is actually the REAL DEAL. Listen to sister Leela!! She's miles better than Joss Stone. They have to be kidding!!! I'd like to hear Leela record some really topnotch material. She's got the voice, she just needs the great material.Keep up the good work Leela... I'm supporting you all the way!"
3,NEO-common?!,"I saw a commercial advertising her CD, so I took a gamble on it. I listened and was taken back by her voice style, which brings to mind a recent singer JOSS STONE of sorts... I like her voice as well... However, the overall CD price far exceeds the worth... Sorry to say.. I support my neo-soul ppl, but out of all the songs, maybe 3 I liked. I applaud the effort and talent because she is a gr8 singer, but the total pkg of the songs don't measure up.. Maybe the next project will be greater..."
4,And she is so right !,"This is a great album,its also refreshing to hear the sounds of real music.From the first to the last each song sounds different. the only problem i had is that the CD song listing didn't match the CD."
2,Not That Great...,"After reading all the rave reviews for this CD, I was really anxious to get and listen to it... but, once I got it, I was not impressed with the CD at all... although Leela has a soulful voice, the songs for this CD just didn't do it for me... I was truly looking for some down home, Aretha Franklin type singing, but, unfortunately, I didn't get it. Maybe she'll do better with her sophomore CD, but, as for this one, I'm glad I didn't purchase it new, or when it first came out... I was quite disappointed."
2,Unexceptional,"Despite all the hype about her, I found the album to be unexceptional. Granted, she does a very authentic rendition of 70s soul, but nothing stands out except for the title track, which if I'm not mistaken, is a cover of a classic; the genuine article shines through her pretty mediocre performance. Lots of soul, but nothing exciting. The No Doubt cover was like Gwen Stefani on mood stabilizers. Yawn."
5,Unbelievable! You MUST have this!,"I bought this CD based on the recommendation on Amazon when I purchased Jaguar Wright. I had never heard of Leela James. But OH MY GOD! This CD is truly unbelievable. Her voice is so versatile. I almost didn't hear the whole CD because I kept playing each song over and over. The lyrics are incredible and I just love the CD. My favorite song is ""Didn't I"" which no one else mentioned in past reviews. I also like ""My Joy"" and the little piece of ""When You Love Somebody"". And being a church girl, I was elated when I hear her singing ""I Know I've Been Changed."" Now that's a bold move to mix those genres, but Miss James pulls it off. I don't know where she came from, but I'm glad she's here. BUY THIS CD!"
4,"Oh, thank God for this","Wow, I had though soul music has gone exctinct. It turns out, it's only been in a coma for a long time.Listening to this fine record, all I can say is thank God! At a time when fakery rules the airwaves and tries to pass for soul music, this record shows us what real soul music is supposed to sound like. Leela James appears to have a long, bright future ahead of her and I look forward to listening to all of her eventual releases."
5,So Soulful,You just don't hear voices liek this anymore. Her vocal and songs takes me back to the old 70's music. She sings with her heart and soul. She shows us how music used to be. Very talented!
5,CLASSIC - CLASSIC - CLASSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I'll Be honest...ITUNES was a godsend..ending the corporate lockdown of the industry...I've been anticipating this cd since the 3 song sampler on itunes.....and did this cd NOT disapoint...This has been the most I've enjoyed a R&B cd since Angie Stones ""mohagany soul""...Buy this now if you want real singing, songs with longevity, not just a producer of the minute feel....buy this now...the track listing has been changed...but I love the intro to ""when you love somebody""...the interlude about marriage...and the 4 extra songs were great.....this will spread via word of mouth and turn into another hit...Warner Brothers better promote her right!! I'm gonna catch Leela @ S.O.B.S. in NYC tonight...can't wait to hear her live!! but the soulful voice was a BREATH of fresh air in the Ciara/...hold a not R&B industry of today..........THIS IS A CLASSIC...END OF STORY....LEELA YOU DID YA THING!"
5,Brilliant.,"This is the best album of 2005, beating out even my prior favorite, The White Stripes' GBMS - and I'm not even a big fan of soul. I caught the video for ""Music"" Friday night, bought the disc on Saturday morning, and it's Monday and I've not stopped listening to it yet.I cannot remember the last time I bought a cd and listened to it from start to finish without interruption even once, much less dozens of times - it was probably 1991, when I bought Pretty Hate Machine. Not even my favorite artists - PJ Harvey, The White Stripes, etc - have managed to press an album that enthralls me like this one.What a phenomenal talent this woman is. I recommend this album to EVERYONE, and so far, no one has been disappointed. Just brilliant."
4,Reminiscent,I was actually picking up a copy of Anthony Hamilton's cd and this was right by it so I took a quick listen at the listening station and I've been playing it ever since. I hear this cd and it reminds me of old school music when music told stories. She has a sound that you don't hear too often a very soulful sound. It's different and very refreshing to hear someone who relies on their actual voice and not on studio equipment. This cd is definitely a start to finish listen. I love the hidden tracks. I was definitely pleasantly surprised and would like to hear more from this artist.
4,It's about time,"That a new comer is coming with it! Leela is a breath of fresh talent. Girl can sang..and is not the conventional little ""looks like an artist"" artist. I recommend this one for sure."
3,"it has been a long time coming, unfortunately not worth the wait","after nearly a two year wait since purchasing a vinyl pressing of leela james' ""my joy"" and ""good time"", i must admit i was disappointed by the debut cd. i do really enjoy and appreciate the grit and smoke of leela's vocals, which conjure early tina turner and candy stanton, but the cd is filled with flat and often lack-luster material including the painful no doubt cover ""don't speak"". leela is definitely one of the strongest vocal talents to appear in recent years. towards that end, i will look forward to seeing her growth as an artist and producer on hopefully what will be many albums to come."
3,a LONG time coming!,"It's been YEARS since her debut was hyped in the once-renowned VIBE magazine. Her debut disc is mostly mellow, with the exception of some Kanye West tracks. Leela and her producers (including ""Commissioner"" Gordon, Raphael Saadiq, and Wyclef Jean) prove that good things come to those who wait. She also covers Sam Cook's ""A Change Is Gonna Come"" and No Doubt's ""Don't Speak""."
5,a truly fantastic cd,"the pubert brown fridge occurrencei took a punt when i brought this cd having never heard it before ,its the best cd i've brought in the last year from the 1st track to the last, 'eight days a week'[beatles cover]is awesome.'come friday afternoon' also great,its very 60's ,you can hear a lot of british groups beatles ,kinks ,small faces,bonzo dog do dah bandif your like me and love that 60's sound you won't be disappionted i highly reccommend it, i keep hearing 8 days a week in my head and i've had the cd for 6mths"
4,Nice Wine Rack but ...,The spacing for bottles is not wide enough for the typical Pinot Noir bottles to fit side by side.
5,Complete and Convenient,"Through these ten years since B-school, I have often returned to the old text books to retrieve a forgotten concept or calculation. Each time, I also referred to Tyran's ""Vest-Pocket Business Ratios"" book..as well as Downes' ""Dictionary of Finance and Investment Terms"". These two books are small..fit easily in the daypack as I head to Starbuck's...and offer quick financial statements and definitions to support concepts. I purchased two copies of Tyran."
1,An Absolute Rip-Off !!!,At first I thought that I had bought a good book for quick reference but then I discovered how I basically got my money stolen out of my pocket: Pay attention at chapter 1 and chapter 3 and then chapter 4 and so on. The book is basically a repetition of the first two chapters. Eg: each line in the index of Chapter 1 is exactly repeated in Chapter 3 and the same with the other chapters. I wish I had not marked my copy with highlighter so that I could return this book!!
4,Well worth the wait,"There is a lot of variety in this disk. The music ranges from high energy pieces like those found on Mark's Legion and Crash Head albums, to more atmospheric pieces, like you would find on some of Jarre's albums. Overall, I thought this CD was well worth the wait."
3,OK but not as good as Legion.,"Well, this is ok. Only OK. It's good to have as background while coding or some such. I doubt that we'll be hearing bits of this used in the same way that excerpts from the wonderful Legion were."
5,A great history of early Los Angeles,"""The story of the Rancho San Pedro traces both the record of the land and of its owners. Extending back through seven generations...summarizing the Spanish occupation of California, land grant regulations, and rancho titles...The main narrative begins with the record of Juan Jose Dominguez, the first grantee, and that of his nephew, Cristobal"" (from the foreword). Includes a chronology, family genealogy, listing of documents of the family, documents relating to Rancho San Pedro, bibliography and index. A well-researched and well-written history."
1,Disappointing,"This was the most disappointing book I've read that was by Logston. The plot continues in a loop, it was all too predictable, the characters seemed to be those in all the other books that you hated. I just wish someone had written a review before me so I wouldn't have bought it just because it was from Anne Logston. I mean, try reading it yourself. See if you don't think it's a third-grade book yourself."
3,Exile,"I enjoyed this book by Anne Logston. It was a fun romp and read with very little pretense at trying to be anything but entertaining. It was consistantly thought out to suspend your disbelief so you could emerse yourself in it without too many -- ""huh?""s. It also stands on its own from its predecessor since I hadn't read the earlier work based in the same fantasy universe."
1,poor qaulity,"Rec'd the printer on time but product has defect. In order to get printer to work you have to slam lid very hard after loading paper. Otherwise ""error"" light will not go out and allow printer to work. I don't expect the printer to work for long with this rough treatment. No way to contact company to complain. I am very dissatified and will not order from them again unless I am contacted and the product is made right."
3,"Good spats, but they have flaws.","These are lower end, but they do a fine job. The only major issue I have, they're a little too flexible for my tastes, but for some things that works better. The thickness is much thinner than a razor blade, so the edges are a bit sharp. The handles fit nicely with no slop, and they are easy to clean because of the polished surface."
1,Waste of Money,"I got this book thinking I could get some objective insights into Russia's severe economic difficulties throughout the 90s. Instead, I got a long rant against everything Russian. Particularly dubious is McCauley's sympathy for the Wahhabi bin Laden-sponsored Islamofascists in Chechnya who have been responsible for all kinds of atrocities. I guess their suicide bombings are justified, because they kill evil Russians and not members of the English Royal Family? Oh well. Sergio Vieira de Mello was an apologist for Islamofascists too, but they still murdered him regardless."
4,realistic,"I think Martin Mc Cauley has produced a book that demonstrates real insight into the functioning of business in present day Russia. It's not a pretty picture he paints, perhaps even a description of bleak is generous, however it is a totally authentic portrayal and as such deserves to be read."
1,stinks,"This book was lacklustre. Just more of the attitudes you find in the Economist.Unless you want a case study of wearisome prejudice and crazy theories, give it a pass."
4,Great swing plane trainer,"This is a great tool if you have problems with your swing plane. I still hit it right sometimes but without a spinning slice, which can be solved by adjusting my grip. Now I can isolate that I have a grip issue instead of a swing plane issue.This makes it so much easier to help diagnosis your own swing problems. If you have trouble with the long game, this can help!"
3,I enjoy Suzanne Ciana,"This album is all right, but I find it compares poorly to ""Neverland"". I love all the non-acoustic, electronic effects Suzanne brings in on that album, while on this one, she merely plays the piano."
4,Nice background music to work with.,"Overall, the music is smooth. I particularly liked Velocity of Love."
2,What happened here?!,"As much as it pains me to do so, I have to side with the negative reviews that Chinese Boxes has generated. Ms. Richey's other CDs--and especially Rise--are some of the most played in my household. However, after a couple of airings of Chinese Boxes, I put the CD up for sale on Amazon. None of the songs here has the intensity, natural lyricism, and/or emotional intensity of her earlier work. Also gone is the inventiveness--that is oblivious to categorization in any genre of music--that made Rise seem so interesting. Instead, the CD sounds all too much like the typical anemic pop played on easy listening stations. Big Disappointment!"
4,Kim Back with a Bang,"I first saw Kim Richey as a support artist in the UK she impressed then and has continued to do so with this fine offering of songs. For anyone that hasn't heard any of her earlier songs this one would be a fine one to start with, I guarantee you go for the back catalogue."

4,"Seeing Ourselves: Classic, Contemporary, and Cross-Cultural Readings in Sociology, Sixth Edition",Enjoyed getting my book in time for the next class.
3,"Looks good, but fits too tight","This boppy cover is very unique in style and color vs. the others out there. However, after washing the slipcover, it fits so tightly over the boppy pillow that the zipper keeps splitting open. It looks nice, but I can't lay my baby across the pillow without the zipper opening up. I would not buy this cover again."
4,"Some good mixes,,,,,","I liked the mixes of this song. The club mix definitly has it's own beat but the original mix is just a longer version of the ""Tattoo It"" album version. The 12 inch version also has it's own sound as well..If you like the song it's worth getting if you can get it a decent price,,,,(under $30)"
3,mystery pack,The films weren't very good and I am not sure where they came from. Probably 'b' movies that ended up in the scrap heap.
1,not even close to being entertained,"more than one of the movies (as far as I know) were filled with the 'f' word and rather than repeat again the experience, the DVD was thrown in the trash. was looking for family oriented and/or Christian movies."
1,not a bra its a hood cover and its over priced,the picture lies its not a full bra its a small hood protector and it cost more then a full bra BAD BAD CHOICE
4,Nice addition,This is a nice addition to our praise and worship on Sunday mornings. Nice sound and reasonably priced. Best price found on Amazon!
2,"So, So","I think the best title for this book should be ""Making Music With Your Computer BUT Let's Learn about Music Theory and Do The Music in a Later Edition."" This book is more about theory than programming music on your computer. The theory in this book assumes you know how to read music. It does not instruct those without a clue, but I was lucky to have already known how to read music. If you're looking for a book to give you some insight to write commercial music, this isn't the book. If you're looking for ideas on composing for an orchestra, buy it.So, what's good about the book? There are a few chapters on mastering, MIDI, and sound synthesis. They aren't highly detailed, but it will give you a clue to what those topics are about."
5,Can't be beat,"Over the years, I have purchased nearly every Paradox for Windows books I could get my hands on. Things have to be worded just right in order for it to sink into my thick skull. This book is excellent in every way. The examples and explainations along the way ""Can't Be Beat"". You can't go wrong if you intend to program in Paradox for Windows, especially if you use this book. I'm still waiting for this writer to produce a Paradox version 8 book. Let's hope its soon!"
4,A good extra reference,"As the author says, he tries to avoid repeat the material which is already in the program's owner manual. He explains some of the database and file related concepts. Overall, it is a good extra reference."
4,Just for the record,"Here's a translation of the titles, for those who'd like to know: 01. Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind 02. Stampede of the Ohmu 03. The Valley of Wind 04.

3,"Good, but others are better...","Don't get me wrong, I love Joe Hisaishi, its just this was probably one of his first albums, and other such as Castle in the Sky, Spirited Away, and Howl's moving castle are better.Throughout this Cd, thin strains of future themes can often be picked up and you almost expect to hear a few of the pieces here and there.I don't have the tracklist, but the piece with the child singing is beautiful, as are some of the main themes.However, I think my main complaint against this, would be the songs including some drumbeats and weird post modern keyboards.To me, this soundtrack was just okay, there is better out there..."
4,I love it,"I love this soundtrack. It is (as another reviewer said) sort of a mish-mash of styles, a few symphonic and orchestral, some electronic. The soundtrack as a whole may not be Joe Hisaishi's best (or most cohesive) work, but the main Nausicäa theme is my favorite of all his compositions, hauntingly beautiful. That song alone is worth the price of the disc--at least it was for me!"
2,Sadly unprofessional and historically disjointed.,"Where to begin? The narrative by Varina Davis, mostly about Davis' first wife Sally Taylor, just begins without any introduction. Other scenes appear with no connection or transition. The scene of the announcement of Davis' election to the Confederate presidency, while attempting to portrey the circumstance, fails miserably. The actor representing Davis doesn't look even a little like JFD. Then the next scene with the apparent JFD impersonator, who looks like the man and evidently had done this before, bears no connection or resemblence to the other scenes. Too bad this guy didn't play JFD for the entire ""film."" I stopped watching at this point because I couldn't take this high school skit night acting, purporting to be ""the only feature length film on the life of Jefferson Davis."" Having read a number of biographies and related works, this was quite the dissappointment."
1,broken train set.,"received train set, but it did not work. i was asked to send pic, which i did. but did not get a response."
2,This modern romance novel doesn't do it for me,"Twenty-something Bette lives in Manhattan, has a close knit group of friends, enjoys romance novels, and apparently possesses little fashion sense or celebrity IQ. Everyone Worth Knowing is the story of how she becomes an accidental success in the surreal world of celebrity public relations, and finds romance--real and fictional--along the way.Maybe it's just me, but Bette seems to have problems many people would love to ""suffer"" through. Although told a lot of things about her, I never got the feeling I could really picture Bette or understand what she wanted, even in the end. Her story feels underdeveloped and many of the events predictable or random. Still, if you liked The Devil Wears Prada and enjoy modern formulaic romances, you will probably enjoy Everyone Worth Knowing."
2,Who are these people giving the book 5 stars?,"I'm getting the impression that the people giving this book 5 stars are Lauren Weisberger's friends, or some interns from her publishing company.I read the book on a plane. I wasn't ever expecting great literature - after all, I did buy a ""chick lit"" book. However, this is just ""The Devil Wears Prada"" but in the PR business. I didn't relate to the main character (Bette), and the book was very predictable. Within the first few pages, you'll figure out how the book ends. A bit more creativity would have been good.It's an ok book to kill time with at an airport terminal, but if you want to read this book, better you borrow it from a friend than spend money on it."
2,Same Formula as The Devil Wears Prada,"I am so glad I borrowed this book from the library rather than waste my dollars on it.Again I am with the crowd who LOVED The Devil Wears Prada, reading it twice which is unheard of for me and a book. But this one, although I was excited to finally get my hands on it, was the SAME formula.Main character lives in New York, lands a fancy, supposedly glamourous job, hates fancy job, ends up hurting those around her by working insane hours etc etc, gets caught up in a world that is seedy, falls in love/lust with play boy type, quits job, lounges around depressed with best friend ordering food blah blah blah.The author just seemed to change the industry, change the characters names, hair color, make her new boss a little less demonic and voila, another book.I know that I won't be on the waiting list if a third book comes out. We can already predict the plot."
2,Fine to read while I was in the plane,"I completely agree with the reviewer who said ""A complete ""Prada"" rip-off"". I didn't like The Devil Wears Prada but I decided to give this one a shot basically because I had to fly from NYC to San Francisco and I prefered a book to a magazine. This book was boring and not interesting at all. At least in Prada you could hate the boss and think about what you would do to change the situation. In Everyone Worth Knowing there's a great lack of imagination."
2,Predictable and Contrived,"There is nothing worse than being stuck with a disappointing book. You know how these things go, you bring just one book for a long car ride and you have no other choice but to read on just to pass the time. Take my advice and pass on this one. There is better chic-lit out there."
2,Sorority girl reads redo of the Devil Wears Prada,"While Weisberger's story is entertaining enough, it's not much different from The Devil Wears Prada.This particular version of it, the Abridged Audio Book, does not help the material. The reader has the slightly raspy voice of a sorority girl and reads without intelligence. Within the first CD, I already noticed several errors, such as reading ""compromised"" instead of ""comprised"" in a context where the former made absolutely not sense, and occasionally leaving out a word, which made me ""stumble"" over the sentence. Avoid this version."
2,Half hearted review,Just started this book. It's starting kind of slow unlike Devil Wears Prada. But we'll see. I have hope that it will be good.
2,Uncompelling,"I just finished this book, but I feel like I need to read it again in order to figure out why she forgives her love interest for treating her like crap."
4,Escapist,"Hilarious hijinks - who really takes a private jet full of people to go clubbing in Turkey? Fun, frothy entertainment. Don't expect great literature."
2,"A complete ""Prada"" rip-off","""The Devil Wears Prada"" isn't exactly the novel of the century, but I thought it was mildly entertaining and so I gave Lauren Weisberger's second book a shot. That was a big mistake on my part. ""Everyone Worth Knowing"" pretty much has the exact same plot and story arc as ""Prada"": a girl scores a job with big trendy company in New York City. The job quickly consumes the girl's life and she ends up being negatively influenced by her snooty coworkers, getting involved with a creepy guy, ignoring her family and friends, etc. Eventually the girl realizes that her job is dictating her life, so she leaves it in the dust and lives happily ever after. The end.Although ""Prada"" was mediocre at best, at least it was original. Why couldn't Weisberger come up with something new? I highly suggest that you skip this book...if you're looking for a quick ""chick lit"" fix, pick up a book by Emily Giffin...she's the only author I've come across who does the genre any justice."
4,loved it!,"I thought it was great. You need to accept that it's a chick lit book, but saying that, this and ""The Devil Wears Prada"" are far above the rest of those type. This one took a little while to pick up in the beginning but once it did I couldn't put it down - you get sucked into Bette's life and want everything to work out for her to combat the way the gossip pages ruin her life. Write another book, Lauren Weisberger!! Her books make me literally laugh out loud."
2,"Uninspired, tedious, chick-lit pretender","Why do we care that Bettina Robinson is unhappy with her job at the bank? She is given a chance at a new job as a party planner thanks to her favorite Uncle Will. Bette quickly leaves her old life behind as she joins the partying club scene in New York City. She ends up in Phillip Weston's bed, and her new life is never the same. Bette is not used to be trashed by the social columnists. Her boss Kelly loves it because her company gets the headlines. Did Bette make a hasty decision? Her hippie parents think so. True love does come for Bette when she encounters Sammy. Weaved throughout the story is how Bette loved to read romances. The ending is too long, too improbable, and too cloying."
1,BEWARE: Double Du-oh,"I decided to give the author another chance by reading her second book. This time I was smarter and borrowed my friend's copy. I am sad to say that it's more of the same. I was only able to get through one chapter and that was it. It's written in the same shallow, whining path that ""The Devil wears Prada"" was written. Again I'm wishing Amazon had Garbage ratings because this is where this book will end up in. Even my friend can't finish her book and I did not tell her my opinion of it. She came to the same conclusion all on her own."
1,sucky,Do you like brainless literature? Then this is the book for you! I read Ms. Weisberger would like her epitaph to say she was brilliant and drop-dead gorgeous. Humble. And vomitous. This girl's obviously going to hell and I'm nonplussed at how she sells so many books--I can't imagine anyone in a blue state romanticizing her characters' self-pity and unmitigated selfishness.
2,Flat,"Boring. I got it from the library on CD and needed something for my commute or I wouldn't have finished it. Wish I didn't finish it. The end, in particular, was really dumb. I think my IQ decreased by a good 15 points from reading this."
2,This book wasn't written by Paris Hilton? Really?!,"I made the mistake of making this one of the five books I took with me for my four month trip to Japan in 2008, where a paperback book in English costs $20. After finally being forced to read this or reread something I had just read, I finally read this. While it was slightly entertaining, it was mostly snotty, tedious, and seemingly written by a twelve year old girl who wants to one day be like Paris Hilton. It's stuck on my brain to this day because it's such a marked difference from the enjoyable Devil Wears Prada. I hated the characters and by the end was rooting for someone to smack them. Read this if you like chick lit with annoying characters, but otherwise steer clear.Also, I left this in Japan as English practice for one of my friends. It was written in a level where even an intermediate student of English could easily understand it."
2,Disappointing,"This book diappointed me. It had the same, predictable plot as The Devil Wears Prada, and the same poor-me-I've-got-a-terrible-boss theme. It gets old very, very quickly.Bettina (or ""Bette"") Robinson is a young twenty-something living in New York. She grew up in Pughkeepsie with liberal, hippie parents and attended Emory before moving to New York to pursue a career in investment banking. She walks out on the job; and through her uncle Will, manages to find a job working as a party planner.Throw in a handsome, debonair man-about-town who everyone thinks Bette is dating; some co-workers who I think were meant to be funny but just end up looking pathetic; and a love interest, and you've basically got the gist of this poorly-written, over-advertised novel. This is definitely one ""not worth knowing."""
2,Not Worth Knowing (or reading),"I read and (mostly) enjoyed ""The Devil Wears Prada."" While I wasn't convinced TDWP was well-written, it had a fantastic villianess that kept me glued to the book, page after page. However, Weisberger's newest effort, ""Everyone Worth Knowing,"" is bland. Top that off with bad writing, characters the reader doesn't care about, and a set-up and ending seen in the very first chapter, makes this book a definite pass.Weisberger has potential as a writer. Unfortunately, she's nowhere near delivering the goods in this book. Get another book instead, or if you must read this one, get it from the library. It's not worth paying money for... and it's not really worth investing the time into reading, either."
2,Don't bother.,"Let me say, I tried to read The Devil Wears Prada when that came out and couldn't get into it. I thought, give this author another try. So I did. I got about half way through the book and decided to drop it. I just couldn't get into the whole celebrity scene with rich snobby people who think a $20,000 purse is actually worth it.Fortunetly, I got this from the library and didn't waste any money on purchasing this hardcover."
1,"Romance, not chick lit","The key to understanding this book is when the main character - Bette - tells readers that she secretly loves romance novels and wants to write one. It's lucrative, it's easy, and, well, it's luctrative. Lauren Weisberger must have thought so, too. That's why she wrote this silly book. I read it because I liked the storyline in The Devil Wears Prada. But there's nothing here - storyline, writing, or otherwise - that makes this book worth reading. Grade: D-."
2,UGH,"I'll say it again, UGH. I'm only a little over half way through this tale and I'm already wanting to fast forward to the end where she tells off her boss, new ""friends"", finds love and makes up with her BF after profusely apologizing for letting her new job take over her life.And don't get me started on the stereotypes of her Uncles!I too am glad I didn't cough up the bucks for this and borrowed it from the sucker that did!Still... I know I won't walk away and will plod through 'till the end just to see how she tells of her boss and quits her job, how she connects up with her love and re-pledges to be BFF with Pen!"
2,Not one of my favs by Weisberger,"Chic Lit has grown so vastly over a short period of time but this novel failed to deliver the same kind of greatness that The Devil Wears Prada held. I did enjoy certain parts but it did almost seem a bit unrealistic as far as the world of PR firms are concerned. The main character in the novel, Bette seemed like a well rounded character was at times not as convincing as she should have been. Overall, another summer read that is better enjoyed when you don't have another to read."
2,Boring,"This was a really dull book with such a pointless, meandering plotline. I absolutely loved The Devil Wears Prada and would probably put it in my top ten chick lit books of all time, maybe even my top five. So I was completely prepared to love this book as well and found it horribly, horribly disappointing. Go find another fun book instead of reading this schlock. I'm considering cancelling my pre-order of Weisberger's new book because I really did not enjoy this one -- maybe she was just a one-hit wonder."
4,A good read,"This was a cute read, if a little predictable. Some paragraphs are a little wordy and long winded at critical moments when you just want to find out what's going on.. But the dialogue was really funny. Overall, a good read. Definitely recommend."
1,ZzzzZZzzz,"I read the first few pages and it was enough for me to give the book away. I admit I judged the book by the cover and thought it was going to be a good airplane ride book, but reading the first chapter and skimming the rest of the chapters made it obvious that the book had no depth nor excitement to it."
3,"It's a beach read....nothing more, nothing less","Take this book as it was intended. You won't be any smarter for having read it, but if you want a light read that you can enjoy on vacation, it's a good choice. Easy plot, simple flow, light-hearted ride. Go into the book with 'beach read' expectations, and you'll likely enjoy the ride."
2,Good start..... predictable and repetitive,"I was so excited to read this book as I loved, loved, loved Devil Wears Prada. At first, I was really into it. Then less than halfway through, I figured out all the ""twists"" at the end. It was highly repetitive and predictable. I would have given it 1 star, but it did have some funny sections."
3,Entertaining,This book is a good beach read. It is entertaining and keeps your attention just enough. If you are looking for deep meaning skip it. If you are looking for a light beach book this is a good one.
2,Just a little too simple and shallow for my taste...,"The title for this review says it all. Ms. Weisberger's character's lack depth. She had too many sub-plots that she tried to make important (who cares that Bette's uncle's column is losing popularity? does it really matter that Bette has a weird and slightly sickening infatuation with bad romance novels?) and then failed miserably at doing so. I will admit that I was a bit interested in seeing how things panned out, and therefore quickly finished with it, but then the ending was also completely superficial and predictable, and that solidified my opinion that this book was all fluff and no substance."
2,"cute, but . .","Almost an exact re-write of The Devil wears Prada. Cute girl, bad job (minus the terrible boss) climb the job ladder at the expense of your friends, quit said job in the middle of the most important party of the year. Save your funds and borrow it from the library."
3,"Entertaining, but not great","I just finished this book and I definitely found it entertaining. However, I love chick lit and didn't find this to be one of the better ones. It developed slowly, but I did get sucked in about a third or half way into the book. That was probably due to the storyline with Sammy, which is probably the only one capable of sucking you in. The others were simply fun; not bad or boring in any way. It's an entertaining book, and if you enjoy chick lit, you'll probably enjoy it. I would recommend it, but just take it for what it is and don't expect too much going in."
3,looong read,This book took quite a while to get into - and I don't think I ever really got into it! I love girly reads that are quick and delightful - this one was a little too slow moving for my taste.
3,Take it for what it is,"Yes, it's a little reminiscent of The Devil Wears Prada, and no, it's not exactly the Great American Novel. But if you're looking for a deep, meaningful, thought-provoking novel that will change your life, you should probably stay away from chick-lit anyway.Regardless of the flaws that I whole-heartedly admit are present, it's a fun read if you go into it expecting something fun and light to read poolside or on a lazy weekend. Don't expect Fitzgerald or Hawthorne and you won't be disappointed."
3,A mini vacation for under ten dollars,"This is a great book for those times when one needs a break from anything challenging. It's guaranteed to not make one think, and the predictable plot frees one from the stress of suspense.I gave it three stars instead of two for the guilty pleasure of reading about designer clothing I cannot afford, riding in limousines and flying in private jets, clubbing all night at chic hotspots with no children to care for in the morning, and being pursued by gorgeous hunks. I don't remember what Cristal tastes like, it's been so long, but it was delicious reading about it.I agree with the others here - it is not real literature. But it is a fun read if you are looking for something light."
3,A Pleasant Extension,"Clearly, Lauren Weisberger has the knowledge and the ability to write entertainingly about the NYC glam scene. This book, while not having the impactive central villain/character of ""Devil"", is every bit as much fun to read.Some of the characters, including her uncle, were scene-stealers.This could be a great film."
2,367 pages of...?,"Yes, it was a fast read, but it lagged on.. and on. The ending to the book was entirely too predictable, leaving you feeling bored and unsatisfied. The main character, Bette, has very little depth. First she's sad and fat, then thin and fabulous, etc. etc. It is not a book I would recommend if you are generally a person who enjoys books that make you think. If you're looking for mindless entertainment, however, then go for it. I enjoy fun, easy-going books every now-and-then, but I feel like this book had very little substance."
3,"Slightly filling, but more disappointing","This book was only half-satisfying. Everyone Worth Knowing is sort of disappointing compared to the author's last novel, The Devil Wears Prada. The Devil Wears Prada was very well written. This novel echoed every other book of its kind. Bottom line,the plot is stale. The whole ""innocent girl corrupted by the beautiful people"" show is slightly overused. Still, I found myself continueing to read it. I'd give this book a 5.5 out of a scale of 10. However, the ending was okay."
1,Not worth your time,"If you read ""The Devil wears Prada"" , you have basically read this book. Exact same story line, just different characters. I was very dissapointed. I couldnt even finish this book from utter boredom. It's awful! I loved ""Prada"", I thought this would be equally as good but it's just not."
3,Good not Great...,"This book was good and entertaining. There were some good parts, but I felt that the beginning dragged out longer than needed. No rave from me."
3,Took a bit to get intrigued,"I bought the book at Sam's after reading ""The First Assistant."" It had some resemblance to ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" but the beginning dragged on with little interest. It wasn't until Bette Robinson was connected with Phillip Weston that the book became a great read. Overall it was a good book, but I wish the beginning had a little bit more intrigue."
2,Disappointed...,"I too, thought that this book would develop a sense of connection with the characers, plot and humor that I found in her previous book TDWP. Not here...the jokes are weak, the situations predictable, and with only a minute amount of difference the same outcome, and story, as her previous book...What Happened Weisberger? If you were writing to the people that you depict in your books, then you might have found an audience, BUT to be successful you have to do a far reach into the lives of everyone, worth knowing or not. Maybe your next book will again be fresh, funny and revealing that you have talent. Write a Crime Novel! There, I think that you could. Good Luck on your next one...this one did not hit the mark that YOU set."
2,B-O-R-I-N-G,"I am an avid reader who usually gives every book a chance, but I could not finish this book. What a snorefest."
2,Very Poor,"If you are in the mood for a good book, then skip this one. This book was very predictable, boring and had a horrible ending. It was a waste of my time. I enjoyed a Devil Wears Prada and thought that this would be just as good. Boy was I wrong."
1,Horrible to the Last Word,"I don't usually review items on Amazon because I haven't loved or hated anything enough. But this book--it was so terrible, I couldn't not write a review. Thank goodness I bought it from a used book store and paid half of the list price, but nonetheless, not worth it. I don't understand how one book could have housed so many cliches and so many useless celebrity mentions. Was it really necessary to highlight that Ashlee and Jessica Simpson were VIPs at a fictional PR event? Was there even a climax to this book? Absolutely, ridiculously terrible. I think I lost brain cells reading it."
4,A fun read,"Personally, I enjoyed this book. I can see how some people can compare it to The Devil Wears Prada. The characters are not as developed, and the plot is less believable. If you want to read a very in-depth, insightful novel, skip this book. But if you just want a fun, easy read, you might enjoy it."
2,Let down,"To get away from intense college reading, I enjoy light, fluffy books that are easy to read. I liked Devil Wears Prada and was excited to read her second book. I was disappointed. It might be an ok read if it was her first novel, but Everyone Worth Knowing is definitely a sophomore slump."
1,What planet is Lauren Weisberger from?,"To be pitied are the people who find the characters of Lauren Weisberger's novels interesting - or worse -- want to immulate them. Her characters claim to have depth and individuality but are more shallow than not and they easily fall in with the mooing herd.Lauren Weisberger seems to be attempting to belittle the world she apparently inhabits. Instead, she pays it homage in a twisted way.Whatever she intends with this book, it isn't worth the effort."
2,Skip This Light Read...,"I'm so disappointed. I'm forcing myself to finish EWK. Although I thoroughly enjoyed The Devil Wears Prada, the author's second book is tedious, tiresome and devoid of likeable characters."
1,Don't waste your time,"one word: badif you could arrest books for all around sucking, this one would be the first to go in handcuffs."
1,Lame!,"Lauren Weisberger is a poor -- a very poor -- writer. This book is lame, predictable, poorly written, and BORING. Don't waste your money."
5,Loved it!,"This book tells the story of so many women.It's so difficult to get into the in-crowd of NYC and some people will do anythign to stay there.It's the story of a young lady who finds herself in the midst of it and all doesn't like what she sees.Rumours, drugs, parties, alcohol, sex, sex and more sex.lolGreat book!"
2,Just reread the Devil Wears Prada,"If you've read the Devil Wears Prada, then you've read this book as well. The only thing that changes is the characters' names and jobs. It was a huge disappointment."
4,Great for a chick-lit!,"Ok, yes, this isn't the next great American novel. However this book is a great chick-lit to read when you're missing your best friend or if you just want to live the virtual life of someone on the NYC social scene. Similar, yes, to The Devils Wears Prada but different enough to not have you guessing every beat of the book.A worthy read for all fans of chick lit but if Hawthorne is your favorite writer you may want to pass."
4,Starts Slow- But Worth Sticking With,"Although it started out slow, once it started, I was sucked in.I actually enjoyed this one better than ""The Devil wears Prada"". Women in thier mid-twentys will find it very easy to identify with Bette, the main character. 100% Chick Lit!"
3,"Fast Read, but left without any sort of feeling","After finishing the book, I thought to myself...why did I read it? I think I may have enjoyed it while reading it, but it left me not wanting any more...and just kind of regretting spending $12 for the book"
3,S'ok but I expected more,"Maybe it's me but after ""Devil"" I wanted to be wow'ed. I wasn't. Somewhat clever at times. monotonous at other times. i wish the characters had more depth. I can't wait for Stephanie Klein's book to come out. Her blog makes me swoon. Bring me back from the dirth of good books..."
1,You've Read This,"I enjoyed The Devil Wears Prada and also was on a 'big city chick lit' kick so I decided to pick this one up. UGH. Not good. The concepts were so similar to other books in this genre and to TDWP book that I repeatedly wondered why the publisher put this one out. A few of the concepts were overdone - women not eating, the gal being overworked and ignored, etc.The author has writing talent, I just think she needs some new material. Such a shame that the publisher put this one out. It's getting blasted and I don't think it is the author's fault. I guess this is what happens when you push a deadline."
1,Absolutely Awful,"I occasionally appreciate light, fluffy novels, but there is no excuse for meandering plots, unsympathetic characters with inconsistent personalities, and all around bad writing. And this is the edited, published version. Stay away!"
2,Yawn!,"It took me 2 weeks and a bit to read this book. Do you know why? Because it was SO BORING! Nothing really happens and just when you thought something was going to, it doesn't."
1,Extremely disappointed. Don't waste your time!,"This book was an immense disappointment. I was about half-way done with the book when I felt that it wasn't even worth continuing. This book is a major let-down and a total snooze-fest. It almost felt like torture trying to get through this one, and that's highly unusual for me considering my intense love for all things ""chick lit"". Don't bother with this garbage. ""The Devil wears Prada"" was a fantastic read though! I don't know what happened..."
2,Fun read but keep expectations low,"I read the Devil Wears Prada and didn't get the hype. I just wasn't impressed with the plot, characters or writing. Thought I'd give this one a try as the plot sounded more interesting. It was. It's a fun voyeuristic look at NYC club life, but it's pretty predictable. Figured out by the second mention who Ellie Insider really is; Phillip Weston character got old fast; romantic interest plot was a little cheesy and elements seemed thrown together to see that side of story through - especially towards the end. That said, I'd read it again as a guilty pleasure. If you are looking for an easy no-thinking-necessary read, this one fits the bill."
2,It was.... how should I say it?...an okay book....,"I read this book when my sister let me borrow it after reading Devil Wears Prada by the same author. And... well... it's not really all it's hyped up to be. It followed the same kind of plotline as Devil Wears Prada, but like the other reviewers said, it lacked the memorable Miranda. Instead it substituted with some celebrity names, droppings of crack and bulimia and some wild parties that were monotonously narrated word for word. It got to be sort of the same thing over and over again. Don't get me wrong, after the slow beginning it got going and became ""worth reading"" once her love interest kicked in. But then it fell sort of flat and became a chore to read. Bottom line is, its a great book for a lazy do-nothing weekend but if you want something with substance to write home about- I'd suggest either Devil Wears Prada or another book in the ChickLit genre."
3,"Quick, fun read for the lazy day","I did enjoy reading this book, but it too closely resembled ""The Devil Wears Prada."" Her writing reminds me of Clive Cussler and other very popular authors where she basically sets up a template with changes of names, locations, and bosses. But it was a fun read for a lazy Sunday."
2,Devil Wears Prada Part Two,"Same pathetic main character with no back-bone. I only read up until the part where she has to leave her best friends going-away party to attend some ""Crucial-must be there"" meeting for her boss-on a Saturday. I closed the book."
1,B-O-R-I-N-G,"I'm trying so hard to get through this book, hoping it will get better. I'm not even half-way through, and I don't think I'll get there!! It is a huge disappointment compared to The Devil Wears Prada. I flew through that one and this one is a struggle. I don't care for the main character and I find her annoying due the stupid things she does. I used to love this ""type"" of book and found them all to be very entertaining, but now they're just getting harder to read -- the whole ""I'm rich and beautiful and young but my life sucks so I can act like a wimp..."" storyline. SKIP this one!!"
1,Not again,"Another tedious addition to the genre of 'poor me, look at the horrid / crazy people I work for' books. DWP was a rather interesting insight into the fashion mag world but I really don't see what the point of this book is. The plot is fantastic (in the old fashioned sense of the word) and alienatingly ludicrous. Guilty pleasure it is not.Please don't waste your life reading this. I did, and I shall never stop regretting it!"
2,Recycling is good - just not for plots,"I never read The Devil Wears Prada, though I did see the movie. And from what I can tell this is just the same story wearing different Jimmy Choos. It's the same formula retold with slightly less believable characters. It was okay, but nothing new or exciting - definitely predictable, and not in a good way. I can only hope she breaks out of this mold if she writes another book, because it's getting old fast."
2,Entertaining enough but leaves much to be desired,"I was excited to read this book because I loved Devil Wears Prada. Unfortunately Everyone Worth Knowing lacks sufficient character development and follows along the predictable path of her first novel. The cast of characters are predictable and cliche. The main character failed to have much charm or relatability. Overall, the book was very flat without any real connection with the characters."
3,A Brilliant Balloon With the Air Let Out.,"I would have given this book five stars, because the first two major sections were brilliant... among the best of the literature I've read. Then Triste had to take up a lot of the third book, and I cheated on the book and started reading something else. This dropping of the book is going to bother me for a while... I highly recommend this book to other readers, especially those interested in the Cuban lifestyle, however, you must pretend that the book ends at the second part... even if the web involving Alicia and Julio Cesar Cruz is not resolved... or else skip Triste's tiring monologue."
3,tight and white,It fits a too tight on a regular sized male head and is whiter than it appears in the image. Probably better suited for younger females.
4,Cute but hard to squeeze,"These are cute bath toys, and so far I haven't seen them get mildewy on the inside like some of my daughter's other squeezy bath toys. However, they are difficult for her to squeeze and get the water to come out. I'm sure as she gets older and stronger, that won't be an issue, but by then I am not sure they will be of as much interest anymore."
4,Love these!,"These bath squirters are great! They are super cute and a lot of fun in and out of the water. In fact, my husband loves to play with them as much as my baby girl! After a few months I throw them out because they certainly will get moldy as they retain some water."
