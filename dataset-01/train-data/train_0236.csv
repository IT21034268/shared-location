4,Knowing Marley,"It is hard to get to know Bob from a Business view - this story was more of Don Taylors life and thoughts, as it should be, he did write the book. This is a great book to read, even if it is to see Bob Marley in someone else's eyes. I have been a fan of Bob's for Many years and I must say, there were more than a few new things I learned. I could have done without the ending, knowing all of his financials and all that happened to his estate. Personally, that is something the family should deal with and Don Taylor should keep that part private. Then again, it is his book and his way of seeing, knowing and loving Bob Marley. Anyone who is into Bob should read this book. ~Marleighgal"
3,A bit dry ... Cultic Poetry says it all,"This was one of the required books at seminary. It focuses on the actual forms of the Psalms and their historical relevance.While I recognize that the word Cultic is probably technically correct, I found it difficult to accept using this word when discussing the faith of those who wrote the Psalms, and I have not really used it since it was required reading."
3,OK reading,"This book was OK but not particularly memorable. The main reason I bought it was because the hero and story appeared to be like that of a Lynne Graham book. But the hero was a let down. Though he was gorgeous, he was not as sexy or intense as a Lynne Graham's hero. Also, I did not like the heroine. Her continual disbelief in the hero's explanation of what had happened in the breakup of their marriage grated on my nerves."
3,Will an Earth colony world become an insect colony?,"This story is adapted by the series script editor at the time, Terrance Dicks. I remember watching this story on TV and finding it particularly good.The Doctor and Jo are off in the TARDIS, on a mission for the Time Lords. They arrive on Skybase One, in orbit around the planet Solos, one of many planets subjugated by Earth's empire. They must deliver small container to someone - but they don't know exactly who.There is tension between the natives of Solos and the Earth men. Earth is exploiting Solos' mineral wealth, and something else is happening. Solonians are starting to mutate into insect-like creatures...Reading this book and thinking back, I have to say that the reality is that the serial (six episodes) was probably too long. Of course, this gives the book an advantage: it can skim over the parts that may be regarded as padding and stick to the central story - which is still quite a good one."
1,Not that great,"I was disappointed with this DVD. I usually like all of Denise Austin's video workouts, so I bought this one for my little sister. She wasn't interested in it, and I can see why. Everything seems too choreographed, and then kids are fake. They don't look like ""normal"" kids - they're obviously dancers/actors, or something. I also bought Billy Blanks - Tae Bo Kicks for my little sister, and she loved it!! I would recommend this DVD if you're looking for something for a child."
5,Fun Family Workout,"I think this workout is great motivation to get the family to exercise together. My kids (9, 6 & 3) love it. They may not be able to do everything perfectly, but they really enjoy trying. I really love the sections that have exercise for partners. It's fun to see my daughters working together to exercise. I think it's a great idea to have a workout that the family can do together."
5,Fitness made fun!,"My kids and I love this workout video! It is perfect fun activity for daily workouts, for bad weather days or just to do when we don't have other sports. The first 20 minute workout introduces moves in a way that my 10 year old can follow (but I can still get a good workout if I do it with her). The 2nd workout is more difficult but alot of fun because of the buddy system and the use of balls. I started to not buy it because of the bad rating, but I am glad I did. It has kept my kid's attention and Denise is so positive and motivating. I definitely recommend this to any parent who is trying to get their kids more active!"
2,Too Easy for 10 year old,This was a cute idea but not motivating or challenging for my 10 year old. She wanted to start getting conditioned for soccer season and this was a waste of money for that purpose. May be good for younger kids who just want to get up and move around but not for anything more serious than that.
3,Mom of 1,"This product is okay, it is made up of two 20 minute sections. My four year old screams to watch it, but isn't motivated to stay with it too long. The Second half is a bit tougher for little ones to follow. The second section follows a whole family Mom, Dad, brother and sister ... It is more geard for beginner type adult then children. I love to do tae bo and found it rather boring.The kids are entergetic in the video. All in All... maybe for older children 7-10?...I say go for older..."
5,Fit Kids,"My 5-year-old daughter loves this video! She does both workouts on the video. She didn't do much exercise before, but she absolutely loves this."
2,Disappointing,"I really expected a little more from this children's workout video. I thought there would be more fun moves, like dancing, for one thing. Also, Denise has had some beautiful backdrops in some of her videos, like the ocean, for example. The settings of these videos are disappointing."
2,poor video,"Neiter myself or my 3 year old enjoyed this exercise video. I didn't think it was kid-friendly, and it didn't hold his (or my) attention. The cover promises an exciting workout, but in reality we found it bland. My son likes my adult yoga and pilates DVDs a lot more."
4,Great!,I was looking for something for my 4 and 6-year-olds to do during the cold winter months to get some exercise. This is easy for them to follow and fun. I would definitely purchase this product again.
5,Good exercise for all,This is excellent for kids and easy to follow. My 3rd graders love doing it. Very up beat and great exercise.
1,Not that kid friendly,I really didn't like that it had yoga in I didn't know it when I bought it but I would not have purchased this knowing it had yoga. Other than that Denise doesn't really seem very into it almost like she doesn't really know what to say to get kids motivated. The music is not upbeat AT ALL but very dull. My kids didn't even like it. I would recommend looking for something with more upbeat music so your kids will be more into it. This is not a good workout video!!!!
4,It's a little bit loose,"When I put it into my chinchilla's cage, they began hoping from one ledge to the other like crazy. They absolutely loved it! Unfortunately about a week later, one of the ledges splintered and the screw came sliding out. I would highly recommend these to any chinchilla owner, but you might have to reinforce the screws yourself."
4,Good solid ledge - could use a better attachment mechanism,"This ledge is made out of a thick piece of wood. It is designed to be chewed and my chinchillas do chew it. It has two slits cut in the back for you to insert the horizontal cage bars through, but neither of my cages had the bars at the same separation. So instead, I sandwiched the cage bars between the two included washers. The washers however, are slightly too small (they don't reach across two bars, leading to the possibility of the ledge becoming disconnected from the cage). I managed to wedge it into a corner where it works, but if the washers were a bit bigger, it would be better. I've bought this ledge before, and the old washers were indeed bigger.This ledge is about an inch shorter, but much wider than this similar ledge: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002AS57I"
4,One of the more unique talents,"If you haven't heard Judy Henske what she does is pretty much beyond explanation. If you have heard her - you don't need any explanation.Through fire and flood and the other calamities of life I've managed to preserve or replace about a dozen of my favourite lps from the early 60s -- This one and ""High Flyin' Bird"", Judy Henske's second album are among that dozen. She is the only living person who can compete with Bessy Smith on ""Nobody Knows You When You're Down & Out"" - unfortunately that cut is on another album which didn't survive.Some of the comedy on the album gets old fairly fast. For many years I've listened to a tape I made of it, which cut out the comedy -- it was pretty good but after a few hundred hearings you can live without it."
4,Good help for intermediate level,"Dr. Smith Brindle offers a very usefull text for those who alredy started in composition. This book provides both theory and practice. It's a good choice for one familiared with the main counterpoint and harmonic procedures, as well with a background in Music History."
4,Insecurities are funny. Right?,"Imagine if you took every dark and self-loathing thought that a person ever had and then lumped it into a book. If you can imagine that then you might just understand this book. The art is phenominal, the writing is heart-wrenching and extremely clear and beautiful, but this book is not for the easily upset. Though Ware's comic style is often misread due to its breaking of the common left to right, top to bottom format this book is definetly worth the time it takes to read it. If you're a common reader of Graphic Novels or just starting out this is a great book for you.Warning: don't buy this for your ten year old son. Comics aren't just for kids anymore and if you don't know that yet you will soon."
2,"beautiful, but depressing","As another reviewer noted, the type in this book is so small that reading is an effort. And the stories are depressing enough that a little goes a long way. The book is quite lovely, but I seldom find myself reading it."
1,Save your money - better sources of this info,"Marginally useful at best. There are much better sources of radio pricing data and photographs. The values are not real-world, and arbitrarily assume that the radio is NOT WORKING! What good is that? There are no adjustments for working condition, or other cosmetic condition assessments."
4,Good reference guide,"Very good and fairly complete guide to old pre 1960's radios.The book's publish date is from about 3 years ago,so the radio pricing estimates therein may not be that accuratefor today's economy, but still in the ballpark in most cases.I bought my copy used and definitely got my money's worth."
4,Pretty decent guide,"I really enjoyed the book and have taken it along on radio hunting trips. It gives you a place to start but there are a surprising number of radios that are not in the book. Still, it has provided me a good basis for valuation and a real education of the universe of antique radios. Thanks."
4,Good Antique Radio Reference Helps You Identify Your Finds,"This 248 page softbound volume is the 4th edition of the popular guide. If features more than 600 full color, sharp photos and covers over 5,000 models. There is a useful introduction to the collectible, and it provides basic radio terms and descriptive information. Everything is listed by company. It appears to be a very comprehensive listing, but there are probably many models that do not appear. I'm certain no book has every model of all of the radios made. Items are easily located, and every major maker is included. Prices are updated for 1997. I'm a novice in this area of collectibles, but it appears to me that the book is quite comprehensive. It has been of value to me and I'm sure will be to others."
4,Good starting place for collectors,"This guide gives a good overview of old radios. I agree with other readers that there are some iconic radios that should have been pictured.However I can understand that the content had to be limited to make the book affordable. Myself, I would pay $60 for a larger book that had 4 times the content. Some short history on the manufacturers would have been nice too. On the positive side, this book has made me more aware of the variety of radios that were made. I can now better decide what I want to buy. The prices should only be used as relative value gauge."
2,Jr. Soccer/Street Hockey Set,"This is a very cheaply made product that does not stand up to any child play. My sons got this recently and within 24 hours one of the sticks had broken. The company was nice enough to send a new one out but now (only a few weeks later) the plastic on the goal is shattered. The goal also does not stay together very well and comes apart with each goal scored. Overall, I would highly discourage you from wasting quite a bit of money for plastic that will not hold up to child play!!!"
1,Don't waste your money,"Bought this product for my two sons ages 4 and 6. Within the first week one of the sticks was broken. Called the company and they sent out another one, but before it could arrive the other stick broke. They aren't made strong enough to use. They plastic simply cracks and totally falls apart. We ended up throwing it out."
3,Kinda Disappointing,I bought this for my 5 and 7 year old sons for Christmas last year. The net was difficult to put together and fell apart easily. The hockey sticks broke after the second game. I was expecting it to last for awhile and unfortunately that was not the case.
4,Good game,"I like this game, good fighting and good storyline...mainly bought it cause the people that made it made fallout 3 and that game is amazing"
4,So close to being perfect,"Graphics are excellent, the game is epic in scope, it's insanely addictive, blah blah blah blah.The only problem I have with Oblivion is the fact that, if you steal something from someones house, when nobody's home, a guard will show up and arrest you. Also, the button to stand is the same as when you're given the option to take something. My character has been arrested a few times because he got caught stealing when he simply wanted to stand-up. Lesson: make sure you're not facing anything when you get up."
3,Oblivion,"Okay you bought oblivion well it pretty much is the best rpg currently available. Ill come right out and say this game is almost unbeatable. There are so many life options you dont know what to do. You could go on the main quest and enjoy that, or join a guild and run off with that. You can get so off on the game that sooner or later it sucks. I would recomend that you buy the game but that you stay on the main quest because if you wander off the game will start to drive you crazy with BOREDOM. Buy the game its a great game if your only gonna play it for a month or to but after that its just dead weight. Great graphics. Great gameplay. Not a memory hogger. Buy it. Enjoy it."
1,I hate all of you....LOL,"I purchased the game based on people's reviews. Man this game Sucks really bad. movement horrible, A.I horrible, action horrible. what has this world come to that people can actually play this garbage."
5,Awesome game,"One of my favorite games of all time. I ended up switching my console to a ps3 however, so I sent this to my younger cousin through mail. He absolutely loves it as much as I do, which is saying a lot. One of the best games ever made, definitely a must buy for any avid RPGer or someone who is new to the genre or gaming in general. Check out the newest Elder Scroll game, Skyrim, if you enjoyed this game."
4,Elder Scrolls Oblivion is a solid RPG,"I just started this game, so I can only offer my take on it so far. My first impression was the amazing personalization that the game allows for your character. You can tweak just about every facial feature, which adds some interesting fun. The play itself has a kind of old school feel to it, a little clunky. Considering that the game is several years old it still holds up when compared to games such as fable II though. It seems there is a lot to explore in this game with diverse stratagem to make your way through it. If you like RPGs then I say this game is worth a shot. If you are new to the genre, then I would recommend starting somewhere else."
5,Everyone who voted 5 star is right,"There is so much to like about this game, I don't think I need to elaborate any more than what has already been said on these reviews. The only thing I think they would need to improve on in the next sequel is:- A multiplayer feature- More than 5 voice-overs for the NPCsThis game plays so much better than Morrowind mostly due to the travel form option in maps, and the elimination of spells that force you to remedial tasks (such as sap strength which forces you to run naked back to town and cure yourself if you don't have a potion to increase strength).This game truly gives you freedom of choice in what you wish to do. There isn't anything I can say more that others in these reviews have pointed out. If you like RPGs, this is the game to buy for the 360."
2,Too complex for me right now,"I've been playing a whole bunch of other games lately, and this one took a back burner. I played it for about 4 hours or so and I was starting to get bored. There is a lot of detail and involvement in creating and setting up your character. In the end it's an OK RPG, maybe it works for some people, but not for me. I'm also playing Mass Effect and Bioshock right now and both are waaaay funner. I went to my local used games shop, and they only offered me 8 bucks for my copy of Elder Scrolls IV. They had a lot of them on the shelf."
2,"repetitive console actioner, not a great RPG","Oblivion is a good action game, but it not a great role-playing game. Definately not as good as the Morrowind trilogy, but still a decent game to play. One of the problems is that pretty much all the Oblivion Planes are exactly the same, with the exact same route to take, and the exact same enemies to kill. I do like the house I bought in Bruma though, a nice town to settle down in."
2,Overrated,"I guess I'm missing something here, but the game was confusing as hell. I've played RPGs before, but mostly ones from Squaresoft which aren't as customizable as this one was. In my opinion, the customization is annoying...it makes the game way to complicated. I'll put it this way - I've played for over 20 hours and I still don't know how to get my guy to gain a level. There's just way too many skills and stuff in this game.The graphics are okay. If you're not playing on a HDTV, this game will look a lot like a PS2 game. The gameplay is pretty tedious. Combine those 2 features and you've got one heck of an overrated game.One last gripe - and maybe this only occurs on my system - but the graphics ""skip"" around very frequently while playing. This was by no means a smooth playing experience. It seems like they made the worlds too big for the 360 to handle or something, because it skips around quite frequently during normal gameplay."
3,Please Respond,"I know modding is for losers but I want to have fun and c=screw around in Oblivion. Please comment and explain if there are any mods or cheats for the 360 version because I know there are quite a few for the PC. If so, how do you get em?"
2,I hate Oblivion,"I don't see why everybody thinks it's such a great game. I think it's an extremely boring game. It's fun at first, but once youv'e played for a while you just get kinda tired of it. Plus, I don't see why people think the graphics are so good."
2,Addictive but boring,"To me, this is one of those games that are addictive but boring. Quite ironic, I know...."
5,great game but...,"you should buy this game if you want a openended rpg or a quality game. the only thing is it was made as a sequel to a pc game. the menus and interface are relatively easy to use but much better on the pc. if you have the rig to run it, get it for the pc. if you dont, it works just fine on the xbox. just be aware that all the spell menus and stuff are harder to navigate with a gamepad than a mouse and keyboard. you'll prolly love this game"
1,WORST GAME EVER!!!,i can't believe this game is for a modern console. i played better games than this on the NES. Terrible graphics. You spend a good bit of time trying to figure out how to basic things. i rated this game a 1-star because you cannot give negative stars. Aah. i am so angy for buying this stupid game. my time would have been better spent watching paint dry. at least i could hallucinate liking this game as the paint fumes overtake me.
5,My first experience on Xbox 360,"Well what can I say, first person shooter meet roll playing game. This is the first game I played on my Xbox 360 and I am now tainted for life and addicted to this game. Nothing will equal the depth of this game for some time to come. The graphics are beautiful. The ability to do almost anything you can think of or travel there for that matter is something I never experienced on my old PS2. The story line is only part of the game. You are not bound to follow it if you don't want to. It will be there when you are ready. There are a massive number of side quests you can complete and factions to associate your character with and even more to download on Xbox Live. I have been playing about 10 hours a week for the last four months and have reached over level 40. I am still not finished, I am not sure you can finish this game. I you are looking for bang for your buck this is the place. Just listen to my warning... once you start this game there is no turning back!!"
4,Gather round young elves!,"Well here we are, Oblivion IV... Well I'm not gonna mix words here: this game rocks dude. You can be a Mage, Nightblade, Alchemist and the list goes on forever! I would have given this game a five star rating but there is no online play so that is kinda a break in the goodness of the game, but not a big one. The magnitude of this game is at some points overpowering. You can and will want to change from first-person to third-person at any point. You can buy a multitude of different horses (I bought a cheapy, hey I'm a price hunter) like a paint, black, white etc. There is also downloadable content for this game too, like horse armor, spell tomes, and another world. Gameplay: 5, Story: 4, Replay Value: 5, All Round: 4"
1,Amazon does not use zero-stars...why not?,"A stunning failure of the first order. This ""movie"" represents a brilliant story concept lacking only a director, a writer, a cast and a budget.A tired walk through of ""shaky night shots at odd angles""...OH deary me ...I'll be scared in a minute...any minute now...just wait..it's coming....."
4,3-4 stars,"This movie started out a little odd. I didn't just jump into it but, it does eventually take off.Once you start piecing it together and some things are explained, it's a pretty good slasher flick.It's well made and has some ok acting.No real special features though."
1,many problems with this book,I had several problems with this book and I am glad to see that it is out of print. It does not seem that the authors truely tested these scaled down versions of restaurant desert recipes. I tried the banana cream pie which would not set and was to much for one pie plate. some of the recipes had confusing and conflicting directions. I own over 200 cookbooks and am a blue ribbon winner at the Michigan state fair so i think i know what i am doing in the kitchen. This is the first book I wanted to return.
5,Sweet voice with an upbeat sound,"Saw the video for ""Lento"". The video was a little campie but very good. Lento grew on me. Got the CD and have enjoyed it ever since. Really nice happy songs. I think Julieta had fun making this CD and it shows."
4,not as good as previous two,"I can't say I dont like it, it's just that it seems she jumps off to other sounds and ideas for songs. I like the recurrent theme of the lyrics and songs throughout the cd. Some songs just don't sound like they are the best for her. It's not a bad cd though."
2,Sold OUT,"Juliet completely sold out with this album. Even my 17 year ""fresa"" cousin has it. Too poppy, poor lyrics. Oh well, at least we still have Ely Guerra."
5,ANDAR COMIGO - about as catchy as you can get.,"There are a lot of great songs on this CD, but ANDAR COMIGO is clearly the hit. I have played it many many times to the delight of my wife and teenage children. Julieta radiates tremendous joy in her rendition of this song. I love thinking of this lovely, spirited young woman singing this song on stage while. . . she plays her accordian. What a wonderful, vibrant image!"
5,It's too bad she isn't more well known in the States,"After hearing Julieta Venegas on the KCRW ""Sounds Eclectic"" compilation (""Casa Abandonada""), I have been a fan ever since. Although she's well known in Latin America, she hasn't yet got the recognition she deserves in the US. I loved both ""Aqui"" and ""Bueninvento,"" and eagerly awaited her latest album.""Si"" is a bit of a departure from the other two, but it's still a stunningly-crafted, well-written album. My favorite songs are ""Lo Que Pidas,"" ""Mala Memoria,"" and ""Nada Serio."" My only complaint is that the album is too short!"
5,Last CD I bought,I don't buy CD's anymore but this one is worth it. It's not bad listening to music in a foreign language because the lyrics can be anything you want.
4,Great album,"This album is a great album, but I would not consider it a master piece. Some of the songs somewhat sound the same. I also think that a few of the songs have this techno rhythm to them, which makes it sound less 'rock.' I was just expecting more from the album, but in general is good."
5,James Shock's Santa Claus poem is a new holiday classic,"James Shock's Santa Claus poem is what makes the purchase worthwhile. I hope to see it published somewhere else, and I'd love to see more of his stuff. Someone should publish a collection of his work. Keep it up!"
3,There's an original gem hidden here,"Most of the stories are trite, except for the highly imaginative and quick-witted ""The Day Before the Night Before Christmas."" It's worth the price to have this special soon-to-be classic in your children's library. Author James Shock captures the spirit of the season with humor and warmth. A must read for children of all ages."
4,Good beginners book,"This is a good beginners book for ""potential/future"" users of Business Objects. Those who are currently using Business Objects and/or have been through the formal training class will find it simplistic and lacking enough detail to actually jump and start getting results with the product. The description found on page 3 of the introduction is a much better indicator of the content/context/value of the book than the title or the sales materials printed on the back cover(which appears to imply more). ""This book aims to provide a narrative based description of the Business Objects product and can be used in conjunction with the manuals supplied with the product and the contextual help facilities available online."" If this is what you are looking for then the book will meet your needs and possibly provide more value than a more advanced technical reference. If the reader is expecting more than that they will probably be disappointed."
1,Brief,The book literally runs through the Menu items with very brief explanations. Not much use for any practical purpose
3,Not useful to me because I don't use Business Objects,". . . however, if I DID use this software, then this book might very well be of some use to me. I use Informatica, PL/SQL and a little bit of Crystal Info here. Books on those topics would be useful to me."
5,5 stars,"this show is always enteraining, if not a little shocking. i love the new hunky men in this season, Alcide is very fine."
4,True Blood 3rd Season,Love the actors that play the characters in this show. Drama with different beings in every episode. Definately recommend watching.
4,True Blood Crack,"Season 3 did not disappoint this True Blood fan. After a much anticipated wait, my sweetie and I watched it in a marathon of vampires and werewolves that finally solved the mystery of just what it is about Sookie that gets all the vamps gaga for her. It delivers in a satisfying tempo that didn't feel as if they were overly stretching the story to met the required episodes and gave just enough seksi to make watching this after dark in bed with a favorite hunny an added bonus. Get it, watch it, keep it, but only if you like your vampires smoking hot, your weres super base and your heroines spunky. No glittery fangers here darlings, only grown up storylines for grownups who like their fantasy sloppy."
5,great show,True Blood is great entertainment. My husband and I watched the whole 3rd season in a weekend. Can't wait for season four to be releasd. Thanks HBO
4,Excellent season,"Excellent!!!!I liked very much the third season. For me It was better than previous season. Much more development about characters past.Very good performances of the actors, specially The Vampire King Edgington...a very good cast."
5,The True Blood,"Once again, I enjoyed this 3rd season. It appears the town is full of supernatural beings, which makes it more interesting. I am looking forward to purchasing the 4th season to see what the producers and directors have unraveled."
2,Season 4 is really Season 3 part 2,"This show is sliding. I really enjoyed the first season. The second season was not as good (especially once they did away with Godric). Almost so bad that I stopped watching, but I really really REALLY wanted to see Marianne die. I started watching season 3 to find out what Sookie was and because I thought the involvement of werewolves might add some new flavor and be more fleshed out than it actually was. By the time I realized that wasn't the case I wanted to see Russell die the True Death--at this point I will give due credit to the villians on the show. Bravo--but the season finale may be the straw that broke the camels back. NOTHING was brought to any sort of conclusions. It was more like a midseason cliffhanger or your average episode of Lost. Spare yourself (as well as your time and money) and forgot they ever made a Season 3, this show is just going to start spinning in circles."
1,It's an outrage,"This series has gotten absolutely stupid and CHEEZY. If you're a fan of the books, don't waste your time because it has veered so far from them that it should'nt even be affiliated with the Sookie book series. It gives me a headache just thinking about this season of the tv show. Season one was great tho, and season two not so bad."
1,Cheap Soap Opera,"Really liked season 1. Season 2 started declining (because of Maryann character), but season 3 is nothing more than a cheap soap opera. Somehow they managed to make everyone look really cheap and trashy. Sad!"
5,TrueBlood 3- its getting good,"Much better then season 2. Tara is less annoying and Eric is naked. More blood and guts, didn't expect that"
3,True Blood Season 3,I ordered a new copy of True Blood Season 3. I was surprised when i opened the package and found the DVD was not in orginal packaging. It had something dirty on it. I felt like I was lied to. If you are going to list it as new then it should be new. I don't want to pay more money for a new product and then find out that it is used.
2,True Blood third season,"This season is so bad even I didn't believe it. Who ever is writting for the show should leave Charlene Harris's work alone, What she writes is just fine for this series. Stop taking character's who are unimportant in her books and basing an entire season around them. I will think twice before purchasing another season."
2,if you are a fan of the books the show just doesnt do it justice,"I was a fan of the books from day one. I picked up the first book at barnes and noble when it came out god knows how many years ago. Every year I read the new book and loved them. The second to last two books were crap so I have bothered to read the one that came out last year. Charlaine Harris is not even trying anymore really. She needs to end it. Anyway that being said. The first season was good, I enjoyed it. The second season was a huge disappointment I literally had to force myself to finish watching. Same with the third. I think if you are a fan of the books the show just doesnt do it justice."
4,Great entertainment,"True Blood, season three is great entertainment. That's all it is meant to be. I hear and read reviews that claim 'not to get it', what's not to get. True Blood is an interesting diversion and if that is what you expect you will thoroughly enjoy it. For entertainment that teaches or inspires you will need to look elsewhere. Buy it if you are just looking for a few hours of pure escapism, you won't be disappointed."
5,Awesome entertainment,I have enjoyed purchasing each season of this show on Amazon! Each season is better then the last and Season 3 did not dissappoint!!! I can't wait to purchase Season 4 as soon as it comes out on Amazon!!!
4,So Far So Good,"We haven't watched all of the set, but what we have watched, it's very entertaining. I like the subplots and new characters. Looking forward to the next episode."
2,Rethink dvd packaging please,I recently purchased season 3 of True Blood and couldn't wait to watch it! In sat down in front of the tv and popped in the first disc...I was not disappointed a bit....until I came to the 4th disc :( The dvd case was manufactured with a tiny little plastic nub underneath the housing of the 4th disc which had rubbed against it during shipping. All three episodes on the disc were compromised. They all skipped and you could not view the parts that it skipped over no matter how many times you rewound it frame by frame....very frustrating!True Blood: The Complete Third Season
4,"Getting more out there, but still very good :)","I'm a hardcore Trueblood fan! I love the first 2 seasons, but this one keeps you on edge too! I wasn't thrilled about the season finale, but I can't wait to see what's in store for the 4th season!"
1,blueray from amazon,"I would like to say something good but I can't. The blueray disc wouldn't play in our player. I know there is nothing wrong with my player...having purchased other newreleases before and sence in blueray...they need to figure something out..after amazon, I tried to purchase it at another store and the samething happend...so it was something wrong with the blueray discs from the manufacture.."
2,Utterly silly,The show is ridiculous and would benefit from following the books more closely. Also there was far too much weeping in this season. Blech.
3,TrueBlood 3rd season,"Season 3, were to start? (pun intended) I am glad I bought this season, since I have the other 2 on DVD, but I am not sure if I will watch it often. It really goes off in a different direction, and some of the characters I have come to know and love have been altered drastically. Season 3 does have some interesting new characters, and it is nice to finally have something other than Maryanne causing chaos in Bon Temps, but they almost lost me with the 3rd season.Without giving spoilers for the season, I really recommend you look up the season and watch it before buying. For the 1st time I will be watching TrueBlood before it is released on DVD. Season 4 had better improve a lot or I will not be buying it."
3,Good season but hard to watch in parts,I know it is pc to be ok with people being homosexual but I don't want to watch it. Call me old school but I say live and let live but I don't want to watch men kissing and more.As for the rest of the season I liked it. The finale was a little weak. And there seems to be few humans left on the show but it was a fun ride.
5,GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i CAN'T HARDLY WAIT FOR THE NEXT SEASON TO COME OUT. I JUST LOVE TRUE BLOOD. MY KIND OF MOVIE.
3,Worth it anyway,"The quality of the DVDs is great but the plastic insides were all loose so they slide out of the sleeve. Overall, not that big a deal...I'm just glad I can watch the season at a cheap price!"
4,Good almost until the end,"Glad I bought the whole season at a time. two of the episodes were snoozers, but the others were very good and kept us riveted to our seats. Overall, worth the time."
4,A litle bit crazzy,"The more the serie goes on, the more crazzy it gets, still fun but I would prefecr not so many fantasis... I think I'll get a haircut like Tara jajaja!"
5,oh so good :),How I hate it when a True Blood season ends...that means I have to wait another whole year for the next season to come out :'(! I wish they'd make it into a 24 eps per season :(....
3,packaging problems,The only thing that I have a problem with is the fact that the plastic circles that hold the discs in place are all broken. I hope it does not affect the quality of the discs.
5,"Nay Sayers Be Gone! Campy,Entertaining and VERY fun(just me time!)","I love to curl up and watch as the scenes unfold.....Sookie and Bill....Sookie without Bill....Sookie and Bill...Hey Sookie,Take a good look at Alcide! Hot actors, engaging story lines...FUN FUN FUN! People relax...enjoy...stop making it SERIOUS....we have hard bodied guys for us ladies, and hot bodied women for the guys...add a touch of the obscure and you have this wonderful hour of nothing to worry about...Another HBO great! Thanks"
3,sound quality is terrible,"I echo what the other reviewers have experienced: the sound quality is terrible. Portions of the video are impossible to hear altogether. It's quite frustrating. Other than that, the viewing is fine."
5,Awesome,"Love the show, CDs came without scratches. It was new! Good price unlike what best buy offers. I will buy more!"
1,Can't hear it!,There is something wrong with these instant videos. The sound is very low and very hard to hear. I've watched all episodes of Seasons 1 and 2 with no problems but cannot hear these episodes. Amazon needs to fix this!
1,Like watching a silent movie,"What happened to the audio? I really should have looked at other reviews. As TB is a current favorite and I own seasons 1 and 2, wanted to use my PC to catch up with Sookie and friends.Most frustrating experience ever! Every now and then you can understand/hear a complete sentence...other than that, it is a complete dud."
2,Terrible sound and picture quality on the Rental Download,I just purchased this because it is $0.90 cheaper than Itunes but not worth the minimal savings. Go get it on Itunes and you can keep the darn thing as long as you like as well - not just 24-hours.
3,good but not great...,"I have to say that when I started watching this show in season 1 I loved it, but then I got around to reading all the books and fell in love with those even more than the show, they are what get me by now rather than the show because of all the new turns that it has gone on that is so out of sync with the books that I just can't seem to care about the show anymore though for some reason I keep watching. I wish that they had kept more the the books when making the show because then I would have been truely hooked."
1,"Tried to like this show, but...","I wanted to like this show for some reason. I gave it 3 seasons and just can't stand it. It is as if the story lines and characters are written for dumb teenage girls, but it has tons of nudity so it is clearly a show for adults. Don't waste your time."
3,Good,"I've read the books and have enjoyed the series up until this point. I was happy with this purchase at the time. It was a new release and the vendor I purchased this from was very under priced based on the competition. I was worried I would be getting a used product for the price, but it was still in plastic wrap.The show has gone in a totally different direction from the books. It should now say loosly based on the books. Season 2 was a bust and not as good as the books. Season 3 did a better job, but left me disinterested."
5,Great Gift,Great gift at a great price. The recipients were excited to have it because they are big True Blood fans.
5,One of best seasons out there!,"Action packed season! I'm very impressed with characters developing their personalities, My sister already borrowed all of my True Blood seasons and she fell in love with it - just like me!"
5,Miss Melissa,I love the third season True Blood on Dvd. I was even happier with the price that I paid for it. I will buy the next one from amazon.com again. Thanks again for all of the amazing products.
4,Expectations,"After I got over my expectation that it would follow the Charleen Harris story line, I enjoyed it for what it is. Not exactly like the books."
4,Guilty Pleasure,"This is a fun show. I agree with other reviewers that this is not the best season. I still think season one is the strongest. This is great escape from reality and a lot of fun. Few shows can be so dark and funny at the same time. I also find the social satire a unique and surprisingly thought provoking. So, in all it is a good way to spend an hour when you just need to escape from it all."
2,"Low Sound, Crumby Picture Quality And Loading Pauses",I have bought two of the instant episodes and they are all like that. I will wait for Netflix or buy it on Itunes from now on.
2,very explicit content,"lots of adult content. It geared to teenagers, but it is very sexually explict. Beware. It not the typical love story."
1,great actors crummy writers and producers,a lot of juvenile gratuitous disgusting stuff and an ignorant mix of social and political caricature. nowhere near the quality of vampire diaries. occasional fun and excitement but like walking through cow pies to get there.
2,I think I'm done with this series,"I didn't know if I wanted to give this season 3 stars or 2. I got so grossed out from all the gay sex scenes that I found myself fast forwarding through most of the season. I've been watching the series on Netflix. I'm glad I didn't pay for the DVDs. But, to each his (her's,undecided) own. For me, I'm done. with True Blood."
1,So disappointed,"This season sucked in a bad way. Look, I'm a huge fan of the books and clearly this season derailed big time from them. My opinion is this, if you like the books you will be disappointed by the TV show. If you hate the books or never read them, you'll probably like the TV show. In my mind, these are now two different entities. I can't get passed the drastic changes anymore (ex. Sam's character)and I can't ignore the full-blown cheesiness anymore either (ex. fairyland). Sorry Allan, you lost me."
3,first season was best,"me and my wife both loved this show, but the third season just has to many gay couples in it. when it started showing men kissing it just kind of ruined the show for us. i know i will be called prejudice for this but its just something i dont need or want to see. i have no problem with people who choose this lifestyle. if this doesnt bother you then it would be a great show for you."
1,NEVER GOT IT,"I ordered this product on the 13th of October, it is now the end of November and I have STILL not received it. How do I find out about when it will finally arrive?"
1,A parody of itself,"I haven't read the books so I can't speak to people's concerns there. I have watched every episode since the beginning and while I bought Seasons 1 & 2 I have no desire to watch Season 3 again. By the end, the characters portrayed by the five stars were all unlikable, the core story arc and the main subplots have become utterly ludicrous, and the season finale was virtually unwatchable. If you bought Seasons 1 & 2, and you haven't watched Season 3 yet, be warned: Alan Ball has seen fit to throw a bit of unnecessary nastiness into the finale that will drastically affect your continued enjoyment of the first season."
5,Best show on cable,"This is one of the best shows on cable. It has it all. From action to comedy and everything in between. I have season 1 & 2 on regular dvd, and the blu-ray is so much better."
5,Great Gift,"My daughter loves ""True Blood"" so she loved the dvd set as a gift. Thanks amazon......keep up the great work."
5,DVD purchase,"True Blood Season 3:The product came in the original packaging, which promptly arrived shortly after my purchase date. I am satisfied with my order through Amazon."
1,blu-ray,I don't have blu-ray so I will not be watching the one. wish I could send it back I don't know who I chose blu-ray.
5,AWESOME!,"I LOVE True Blood, such a great show. The seasons get more intense and exciting! This is my second time watching it and it gets better each time."
4,"Good show, trouble downloading","I have seen all of the Trueblood episodes and i enjoy all of them. This progarm gave me some trouble downloading on my kindle fire. It worked fine to watch it on my computer, so I am not sure what the problem is. If you enjoyed the previous seasons, you won't be dissapointed."
4,another stellar season!!,I am a huge fan of the series and they have done it again!! A must own for anyone that likes the series as much as I do!
2,Third Season - True Blood,"This season starts out slowly and continues at snail pace. Not the thrilling episodes of the First and Second season. This season brings in more unsavory characters via the werewolves and to watch them in their crude environment acting like, well, acting like wild animals, is not very enjoyable.Alcede can't possibly be one of the unwashed mutts can he? He's cuter, has a personality and dresses better.I'm ready to leave the rest of the episodes (I've watched six so far) and turn on HBO for the new season. This one was disappointing."
5,True Blood Fan,I just love Eric in this season he showed his senetive side and I love everything bout it any wayz this desk set is worth it cause it is like 20 bucks more in the stores like Hasting and others but love this site everything I get is worth the price and sumtimes more...All smiles on my end about this product..
5,love Tru Blood,this T.V. series never lets me down.I love Vampires but then they give wearwolves and fairies too. This is the best series out. finally some good T.v.
2,Save Your Cash!,"The series was interesting after the first five shows. It quickly went downhill from there. Borrow a friend's copy, and save your cash."
2,Not all discs work,"The 4th disk containing episodes 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10 will not play at all. This is pretty unacceptable. Boo hiss."
1,Very Dissapointed,"Not the best quality of product, I was trying to watch the episode 2,3 and 4 and the sistem start to buffer for more than 15 minutes. I am able to get my money back."
3,Bought for my son in law for Christmas,"Can't really give a review since I don't watch it. I am sure my son in law will like it, he requested the seasons for Christmas."
4,Starting to slip,"The first two seasons were better than this one, it is starting to slip. I hope season 4 is better."
5,Can't go wrong with HBO,"I know the first season was like a porno, but this third season really helps develop the characters a little more. Who doesn't love Eric?"
5,Present,"Bought this as a present for my mother, and she was very happy. Product arrived new and played perfect. Amazon and its sellers e-mailed me updates on ship dates and everything."
5,excellent!!,I was very satisfied with my purchase. Was still sealed and in its new packaging! Will be making future purchases!
4,True Blood,"Season 3 seems to be worse acted than 1 & 2! I keep finding ""mistakes"" - like if someone is sitting at the bar with a drink, from behind, the drink is full, but from the front it is half empty! It is so distracting. I still love the show and will continue watching, but it seems to me for something so successful these types of things should have been cleaned up."
5,Adictive,My husband and I both love this series! The only bad thing is that we have to wait so long before the next season is released. We re-watch the episodes till we can get an updated fix.
5,Hooked on TRUE BLOOD,"I am hooked on ""True Blood"" . Alan Ball has brought Charlaine Harris's work to life. I Love the way the movies put a spin on the books. The books and the series are terrific and stand on their own. Terrific job.Author Vicky Renee JohnsonMississippi VampiresA MISSISSIPPI MOONLIGHTMagic And Magnolias (A Mississippi Moonlight)"
5,True blood true love,The dvda worked perfect! I am in love with true blood and couldnt wait to get the third season. Now I just cant wait to get the 4th season. I will most likely get it from here!
2,Very poor sound quality.,The video looked grainy at times. At all times the sound of this on demand video was lower than I like it and I was wearing ear phones. The other reviewer was right.
2,Tara,"I don't think that season 3 lives up to the promise of season 1 and 2, but others have addressed that. All I'll say about season 3 is that the show isn't treating Tara very well. It's not the role she plays so much as the way directors are portraying her. For one thing, her appearance. She is perpetually greasy -- her face is extremely oily all the time. Is that supposed to portray a southern black? If so, it's stereogyping and it is ugly. And the show has her lip wobbling and chin bobbling at an all-time high; for heaven's sake, let the woman show unhappiness via a broader range of expression. She's a good actress and deserves better."
5,Very Good Series,"We got this because it's a very interesting series; Never had problems viewing the chapters...takes a while to download, but it worth it."
4,have given this as a gift,"this product was given as a gift. The product was a request, to finish her collection. very fast delivery and sent in good shape"
5,LOVE IT,"Got to love True Blood! Has all you need romance, action, comedy, and sci-fi! Many smoking hot guys! Love the drama!"
4,not as good as first two seasons,"By this season (spoiler alert) almost everyone seems to have a supernatural power. Which makes the storyline , although unbelievable to begin with, just almost rediculous! I lost a little interest by this season."
4,Life in Bon Temps Sucks!!!,"I thought this season was a lot better than the last. It has more twists. It answers old questions, but leaves new ones. We find out what Sookie truly is, and what Bill's intentions were from the very beginning. Old relationships end, and new ones begin. After Bill Compton is kidnapped, he is brought to the home of Russell Edgington, the vampire King of Mississippi, who wants to take over Louisiana. Sookie needs Eric's help to find him. She eventually teams up with a werewolf named Alcide. Tara is still devastated over the death of Eggs. Sam meets his birth parents, and much more. Team Bill or Team Eric; whose side are you on? I highly recommend TRUE BLOOD: THE COMPLETE THIRD SEASON!!!"
4,From Scandavia???,"Well, i know this may seem picky to some, but I was sent True Blood season 3 from Scandinavia or something. It has thse weird ratings on the back of the box, and its packaged in a blu ray box that is the same size of a regualr BR movie. All the discs are in their, it's just not the same as my True Blood season 1, and 2 boxes, you know like the fold out thing where each disc is separated from each other? I'm not sure why I was sent this version and not the US regular version, but I would have rather had the standard, fold out package. Oh well."
4,Nuff said,"Big fan of the series. It just keeps getting better and better. I will admit the second season got a little overbearing with the complete ignorance of some of the characters and though she only played a small role, I really liked the Daphne character and was disappointed to see her die but onward we must press. If you like vampires but find the Twilight series pretentious, then True Blood is for you. Nuff said."
4,Same Thing,"Buying this is basically like buying Wish You Were Here: Both have the exact same tracks and the exact same track listing. Both should still at least be able to sell a million copies each. In other words...this is a great but complex selection of different material. It's anything but gospel and pop, and I seriously doubt it is country either. Buy either this or Wish You Were Here. Or, if you want, both just to have as big of a collection of Ronnie Milsap material as possible."
3,Still unwrapped,"My wife wanted this, I bought it, and it still sits in our room in its original cellophane wrapping. Who buys CDs these days? Not sure why I agreed to this - maybe someday it'll get opened and hopefully we still have a CD player.My rating isn't whether this music is good or bad (I'm sure it's horrible), but is just sort of a ""meh""."
5,Tommy Hilfiger's products are super,"Thinking about buying this wallet? Do not think about it just do it. Very, very nice product, you will not be disappointed! Thank you for a great product!"
4,Top 5 music guilty pleasures,"All right I have worn out two cassettes of this album and wish I could get it on cd. Yeah he was from the eighties, yeah he was kind of cheesy at times. But this one album he really found a certain kind of infectious joy to the music that transcends quality questions. Mr. Kihn's career never made it past a second tier wanna be rock god status and often times he seemed contrived and like he was trying too hard. Here it seems effortless and like he got into some ska sound and Jackie Wilson type of soul and had fun in the studio. If at first you are wondering what I am talking about and why I would give this album a high review put this on in your car and drive down the road and try and sing along with the tunes...see what I mean? It has a certain kind of greatness. It is sad to see it fade into obscurity."
1,A waste of time,"This book is a real turkey. It seemed to me it was written for a 12 year old. Very poor research and no plot. Actually, I did not finish the book but the first two thirds is terrible."
5,"An awesome piece of journalism and a ""must read""","Esther Kaplan is prescient. If this book had come out before the recent presidential election, and her thoughts had been widely diseminated, the American public would have a very different view of what was, in fact, happening in our country. On November 3, every democrat was running around screaming, ""how did this happen?"". Esther Kaplan already knew.The extent of intermingling between this administration and the hardcore right wing is novel, and bizarre, when one considers the dearth of media coverage on this very issue. Esther Kaplan gives the reader a map to who really controls this government and their plan. A must read."
1,Totally awful!!!,These tortillas were dry and brittle even though the expiration date was far in the future. We ended up donating them to a food bank here because they were not high quality.
1,Horrible,I should have known since they are so inexpensive! When I opened the bottle white powder went everywhere like the pills were falling apart. I threw them out!
4,Dissolves Instantly!,"These pills dissolve as soon as it hits your saliva, activating not only the caffeine but the terrible aftertaste. It the same flavor recognizable in Mad Croc Gum, Jolt Gum, Five Hour Energy, among other products that add caffeine and have a less then desirable aftertaste. The pills easily get stuck in your throat so drink a lot of water with them. Would purchase again, but prefer the caffeine/green tea pills I was taking before."
4,Good product,Pills aren't coated and can tend to be missing a bit on the edges. Overall good product. I do see that they just raised their prices $1.50 though. That's kinda lousy.
4,Jump start your creativity in digital,Digital cameras are great new item for us photographers but just how much they can do and how you can be creative with them is often lost on many of us. I thought I was pretty good with my camera but then I was smart enough to buy this book and follow along as Mr. Georges took me through step by step techniques to make better digital images.My favorite was #49 where you learn how to isolate a flower from its background in order to make it stand out better. I also liked the actions sports section as I am always shooting games that my kids are playing in.
2,Much ado about nothing,This is a rather useless book most of the techniques are known even to amateurs. Its title is misleading you think you will get something about digital cameras and instead you get techniques that have already been given for analog camera.
1,"Good idea, but poorly done","My son was very excited to try this, but after I assembled the flimsy foam tripod, he had trouble getting it to work. First, the tripod is so light weight and soft, that the rocket tips over. You need an assistant to point it upward. Second, the plastic cube on which you stomp is so stiff that he couldn't make the rocket go, even when jumping down 2 steps onto it. He weighs 47 lbs. Third, the smaller rocket was to bent from being in the box, that we could never straighten it. We will be returning this, and getting something else."
2,"Cute, but no cigar",It looks just like the old Crosleys but the sound quality isn't good and various features stopped working over the course of its first year. Maybe mine was a lemon? I'm not going to buy another to find out.
5,Wonderful Memories,"This CD evokes wonderful memories for those of Mexican American ancestry who grew up listening to many if not most of these songs. The songs which are about sorrow and death, lovers and revolutionaries are heartfelt and traditional. I don't think I've listened to any other CD that has such a varied assortment of traditional songs. You'll sing along with the songs and cry with them as well. It's a wonderful tribute to the history of Mexico."
3,"Great at first, but lost it's magic after a few listens...","Here we have an excellent cd, I'm not going to take that away from it. And I still do occasionally listen to it here and there, but it certainly has lost it's magic, in my opinion.There is not one single genre on this album, just a blend of many, which is a great thing, I love bands who do this. You will be able to pick out your favorites after about two listnes, and the ones you don't like as much may become forgotten tracks.A month or two ago, I would have given this 5 stars. Perhaps in a month or so from now, I'd give it 5 stars. It just swings you around and around. Some days you like the cd, other days you don't. It may be quite hard to get back ""into"" it after you're ""out of"" the loop. But certainly, do check this out."
2,i love Chris...,"...but, without nin, his techniques and talents are a bit bland. i woulda given this 5 stars if the album were more of a complete project, i.e. more vocals and lyrics, less 2min-or-so instrumentals. the album just feels more like a work-in-progress/demo-sampler than an album. great ideas like ""swamp"" feel like they were just left adrift. the only song i really like on it is ""microsize boy""...very kooky and interesting synth-pop. this is for diehard podboy fans only(which i don't think i am). not to sound cruel or mean, but, to sum up the album, it's a ""look what i can do with synthesizers and computers"" type album."
1,Nine Nails short...,"This is a prime example that good preview clips plus great band affiliations does not necessarily equal a good album. I had really high hopes for this record based on the clips, but in the end it just sort of meanders about. It reminds me of the musical equivalent of random non-related thoughts. Maybe it's because I like my records focused, but this record has no direction at all. Maybe that's bliss for some, but there's really nothing that grabs you and stays with you after the first listening, and if you can't remember anything after listening to it for the first time, it's probably not worth a second listen."
2,Not what I expected...,"I was looking for techno music, but more new age when I happened upon Tweaker. The music is crazy! I might like it for certain things, or certain moods, but it wasn't what I expected at all (based on the sound clips on the website). It is just my personal opinion. I'm sure there are plenty of people who would like the music. It is kind of a mish-mash of sounds put together."
1,Very disappointing. 339 pages of non-information.,"I was thoroughly disappointed in this book. The author is a master of the obvious. There is not even the most basic information for a complete novice, let alone someone considering ""maintaining and repairing your home theater."" For instance, you get a detailed description of the author's ""wet, dingy, 5'8"" basement. You do get insight on the finer points of building with particleboard and on digging down to your footer to tar your foundation. The advice given on designing a room for a home theater is to avoid parallel walls or else include a sofa and overstuffed chairs to absorb echoes. Other sage advice is to cover your windows to avoid glare. Four full pages are devoted to informing the reader that computers are getting faster and cheaper. Wow! Insightful! The book is full of typos and convoluted sentences. It could not have been proofread. It is as if the author had nothing to say and took 339 pages to say it."
1,"""Home Video"" is a misleading title for this book.","Incredibly, he completely avoids AC3, Dolby Digital, DTS, component video, and similar areas I hoped to learn about. The rest of the book was either overly technical or uselessly vague. This author appears to know little about home theater and a lot about ham radio. It's a poor quality book, and I wouldn't expect this from McGraw-Hill."
4,Good for quick reference,"Accomplishes what it was entended to do: a quick and easy reference for everyday practice, in an intelligent format, with very precise and usefull information. Ideal for residents and very usefull for practionners."
2,Ye gods and little children,"Leaving aside the fact that the author lied through his teeth (e.g. he never actually studied Hwa Rang Do - he offered the Lee brothers some ink and they gave him a faked history) this stuff is about as inefficient as any stick fighting book I've ever seen. Try Marinas' Panandata, Mark Wiley, the Presas brothers, Leo Giron or Ray Galang for stick stuff. You'll be much better off."
4,An Unfinished Classic,"This book was one of the first of the post-Vietnam era ""military martial arts"" books. It is the third (and last) in a proposed series of nine books presenting Echanis' Special Forces applications of Hwarangdo. The author died while the book was in production, and it shows. The text is not nearly so detailed as in his first two books, and two sections were photographed using other people (one with his instructor, one with one of his training partners). Still, this book sports some excellent combat applications using various lengths of sticks. As in most Ohara books, the photos are of good quality. While many books have dealt with the topic of stick fighting in greater depth since this one was published, this book is a fine addition to the library of anyone who is interested in martial arts for combat."
2,Too complex to be applied in sudden violence/combat,"Rex Applegate was right when he said the Echanis method was too complicated to be applied, made even worse if one is wearing gear and carrying ammo and weapons. The more basic approach will prevail in H2H."
5,old but good,"helloa very good book on subjectmonthful technics presentation, very clearthe descriptions have been well detailedabsolutly to read it and discover it to discover itregards"
4,"Good deal, does the job.","When my wife and I decided to do some painting in our house, we realized we needed a ladder to do taping and such on the high ceilings. Looking around for a while, we settled on this one because of the good price, decent reviews, and fast shipping. I haven't felt any of the unsteadiness that some other reviewers have mentioned. Does it shift a bit beneath my weight? Sure. But not uncomfortably so. (On the other hand, I'm used to clambering around on ladders, so maybe I'm just used to it.) For the price, though, I'd say this can't be beat!"
2,not a ladder,"This was a great buy, but is only really a household step stool. Don't get this thinking you're getting an actual ladder. I like what it does in its limited capacity, but thought I was getting something something much sturdier and more versatile. I weight 180 pounds and am not really comfortable with standing on this product. But, in all fairness, it is what it says it is - I just expected more."
2,This is a dangerous ladder,"As a safety engineer who investigates ladder accidents, I recommend that any step ladder you purchase have a duty rating of at least 250 pounds for safety. Also, the aluminum models, while lighter weight, are also more flexible and easier to tip over. I recommend a fiberglas model.I purchased this ladder for destructive testing, not for use."
1,bad ladder,Do not buy this ladder unless you want to fall on your ass. The left front legs will buckle in on the ladder and you will fall on your ass. Beware.
4,Does the job,"This ladder is sturdy, yet light and allows me to get all of the jobs around the house that are high up completed with no issues."
5,5-ft ladder,"For some reason, it's getting hard to find a 5-ft ladder - this one is exactly what I wanted. It is as advertised, and arrived in good time and good shape. It's a lightweight, sturdy ladder"
5,very light yet strong and sturdy,"easy to move, store, and fold. This is very light yet very sturdy and strong."
4,Nice ladder,"I wanted an everyday small ladder that was more sturdy than the typical step stool. This definitely ""fits the bill"". Only gave it four stars due to the price. Should have waited. Big Box store had it for $22.00 on Black Friday. Oh well, still a bargain at the regular Big Box price."
5,GREAT!!!,I think Kevin is brilliant. His book is touching and continues to inspire me. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves poetry. I would also like to say as dc talks #1 fan that they are great and I hope they continue to keep up the good work!!
5,Poetry that Pops!,"I truly love this collection of poems and artwork. It's truly a collectable. Essentially, poetry is personal, so you'll have to judge for yourself, but here are the ones that really impressed me the most:SECRET INTRUSIONCAPTUREDTREE CLIMBERYOU GAVE ME AWAYENDEAVORING TO BE WILDVANITYSOME THINGS ARE BETTER LEFT UNSAIDAlso, the artwork by Jimmy Abegg which illuminates the background of each poem is bold and brilliant. I only wish I owned an original piece. Enjoy."
5,"At long last, the return of the Marx Brothers to DVD.","""A Night at the Opera"" was released on DVD back in the late 90s by Image. Image had licensed the film from WB, and once that licence expired the disc was pulled. Since then that OOP DVD has fetched in the hundreds on Ebay. Finally WB has released it as a special edition.Extra features are as follows:Commentary by Leonard MaltinAll-New Documentary ""Remarks On Marx""The Hy Gardner Show (1/1/61) excerpt featuring Groucho MarxTheatrical TrailerThree Vintage MGM Shorts:Fitzpatrick Traveltalk's Los Angeles: Wonder City Of The WorldSunday Night At The TrocaderoRobert Benchley's Academy Award -Winning How To SleepWB is releasing 6 other Marx Brother's films all at the same time. Universal also is preparing to release their Marx Brothers films this year, including ""Duck Soup."""
4,Classic Comedy!!!,"I happened to catch this on tv the other day and I thought it was pretty good. Groucho Marx is extremely funny! I need to see more of his material eventually, but that's another story for another time. Groucho plays Otis B. Driftwood, which was used in Rob Zombie's 'The Devil's Rejects' Groucho, Harpo, and Chico screw up an opera until Riccardo and Rosa become known. If you love classic comedy, you'll love A NIGHT AT THE OPERA!!!"
4,Woo hoo! Fun for the whole family!,"We'll leave the ""which-is-the-best-Marx-brothers-movie"" argument to the philosophers. As a long-time Marx Brothers fans, my wife and I recently showed this to our 11- and 9-year old children. We all loved it. My son was laughing so hard after the stateroom scene that we had to pause the DVD ... so he could race off to the bathroom! ;-)My daughter enjoyed the whole movie, finding the scene in the apartment particularly hilarious.My wife and I laughed the entire time.Forget Shrek ... and Monster's Inc ... and the kid's movie du jour. For the real classics in humor, show your children A NIGHT AT THE OPERA."
3,"NOT BAD, NOT GREAT","EVERYBODY EXAGERATES HOW GOOD THIS MOVIE IS.IT IS NICE,WITH SOME EXELENT SCENES, BUT IT'S SATURATED WITH TERRIBLY LONG AND SLOW SONGS.IT SIMPLY ISN'T AS WILD,OUTRAGEOUS AND DINAMIC AS THE PARAMOUNT FILMS.WHILE YOU WATCH IT, ASK YOURSELF, IS IT AS GOOD AS ""MONKEY BUSINESS"" OR ""DUCK SOUP? GOOD, BUT NOT GREAT."
3,Disappointing,"If you don't mind fast-forwarding over the obvious romantic storyline and the dull musical scenes, you can find some funny comedy. Based on the comments I've read here, this movie is overrated."
5,By far the best of the Marx Brothers movies.,"An incredibly funny film, Groucho and the gang are really at their best here along with their old foil Margaret Dumont. One of the best sight gags of all time occurs when Mrs. Claypoole opens the door to Groucho's room aboard ship, really has to be seen to be appreciated."
5,"Timeless, one of the Greatest ever","This is simply one of the greatest comedies ever made. The Marx Brothers are manic in this incredible farce concerning an opera company, an ocean voyage, a love story and of course Groucho wooing, mooching etc Margaret Dumont.The sight gags are fantastic and the music is of a higher quality then just about all of their others.The supporting cast does a great job and the shipboard stateroom scene is worth the price of admission.This is one of the best investments you will ever make as it is impossible to get sick of this picture or of the humor within it.Buy it at once!"
5,Fast Shipping,"Hey, it's a Marx Brothers movie. You either like them or you don't. If you have never seen one, start with this one because I think it's the best."
5,Nice book,"Nice book about a famous architect ! Pictures are great and the book is also pleasant to read ... In fact I saw it in a ""pousada"" in Portugal, and I enjoyed it so much that I ordered at Amazon when I came back from holiday. It is perhaps not ""THE"" ultimate book on architecture, but lovers of very modern and human architecture can find in this book a compensation for the fact not to be a millionnaire and not be able to afford such expensive and beautiful houses ..."
5,butterfly chair replacement cover,perfect fit for an old frame. perfect color......goes with our other outside cushions.fast shipping.great all the way around
3,Mixed Martial Arts in the US - The early days,Very interesting for the mixed martial arts fans to see how the UFC begun in the nineties. An historical document to show how the MMA phenomenon has develloped from the time when there were fewer rules and fighters from different backgrounds were trying to impose their arts.Those purely looking for the best quality MMA fights should look for more recent UFC or Pride events.
3,"Only for historical Perspective, not entertainment","UFC 1 is aptly titled ""The Beginning""; nobody had any clue what was to follow.If the UFC aired an equivalent performance today that emulated the skill and excitement of UFC 1, it may lost all but 8 of its fans. It's mind shattering that any good came out of this... but this was the birth of MMA.With the exception of the 59 second Shamrock-Gracie match-up, the other six fights resemble what one would expect to find at the Montana County Fairgrounds, not the highest stage of MMA. You have Shamrock, Gracie, and 6 no-names that lack skill and harbor no concept of a ground game.If you're a UFC fan, buy this tape at a discount for a historical perspective of how far the game has evolved. Don't expect hours of repeatable entertainment, its just not in the cards."
3,Judy is GREAT...But Recording is Distorted,"It is wonderful to again hear these almost-forgotten Blues/Folk tunes from the early days of Electra Records. Judy is quite a performer! BUT, I hear quite a bit of distortion on this CD. Perhaps I got a bad one, or perhaps this due to the age of the tapes that were used for the transfer to digital. Other CD re-releases by Collectors' Choice Music have been quite good. (see my other reviews)"
5,Great Album,"A truly great album by supergroup, The Lost Dogs, ""Little Red Riding Hood"" shows off the amazing talent of Terry Taylor, Mike Roe, Derri Daugherty, and Gene Eugene. The album features a mix of songs from melodic rock to blues to classic rock, all performed exceptionally well. Including a cover of The Beatles' ""I'm a Loser"" and a Beach Boys-esque homage to Brian Wilson, The Lost Dogs show they're on par with 80s supergroup The Traveling Willburys. The album is packed with both humor and depth. Highlights include ""Imagine That"", ""Rocky Mountain Mines"", ""I'm a Loser"", ""No Room for Us"", and the hit ""Pray Where You Are""."
4,Quite Interesting,"I thought the book was very comprehensive in covering the most important aspects of supply chain management. It has some interesting real-life cases to illustrate the concepts. However, depending on your background, I would recommend ""Designing and Managing the Supply Chain: Concepts, Strategies, and Cases""... It gives some much needed quantitative analysis of SCM. If you are new to the field, these two books should give a head start..."
3,great but not excellent,"I thought that this book was full of new things, technichs, methods, I don`t know, something else, but for supply chain management the best book ever is STRATEGIC LOGISTIC MANAGEMENT FROM JAMES STOCK AND DOUGLAS LAMBERT MCGRAW HILL"
3,Not so great,"Works as a filter just fine, but doesn't bend the way you want it to, or clip onto the mic stand very easily. I had to start using a capo to actually hold it tight to the mic stand. I constantly have to reajust it, as it starts falling down just from gravity. I will keep using it, but would've liked a better quality one instead."
3,Pop Filter needs a little work,"Purchased this to launch my new podcast at [...]The one problem I had was positioning the filter itself over the mic. I actually had to go lo-tech to get it perfect. The filter would not bend on itself enough to position in front of mic, but a rubber band seems to be doing the trick. That's the only complaint I have, otherwise it does a great job and you can check out it's performance at doyleclark.com"
4,Popping product,It works pretty good. I plan to use it to record vocals for a music project I'm doing. :) :)
3,Tiny puppy but still cute.,"This is a cute gift, but it's tiny. That's understandable, since it is an item to give a family with a new baby. But I was under the impression that the puppy was bigger; however, it's smaller than a beanie baby. Perhaps I thought it was bigger because I confused this puppy with the other puppy being sold; the one that smells like lavender. Sadly, this one doesn't. It just has lavender-colored ears and a collar. It's still soft, and it will be a nice gift for the baby. But for $17.99? I'd rather have spent it on a nice dress for the baby. It's a great gift; just be prepared to give something else with it (or look cheap for giving a small gift)."
2,Breakaway ha more like breakable,"This toy was kinda a disappointment for me. I'm in college and was looking for the cheapest hopp to put on my door just to shoot at. It broke from just shooting at it over and over. it was also annoying having to put the hoop back up multiple times from it ""breaking away"". Ball is UV colored so thats kinda cool, but not worth it save your money!"
5,Simply brilliant writing,"I'm not a fan of thrillers or mysteries. I'm only a casual fan of 'Noire'. Chandler's ""The Little Sister"" is probably one of the most intense books written in any genre. This is a book of moods: incredible evocations of a time and place and feeling that I have never encountered before. If you aspire to be a writer simply reading this book will teach you a hundred things that can make your writing brilliant. From a small dim shack where a suicide has taken place to a lavish mansion where a vamp waits in a darkened salon--the moods and atmospheres Chandler creates are shimmering and electric. This is a must read."
4,...a ballet dancer with a wooden leg,"About 3 days ago I bought and read 'The Little Sister'(1949).The plot is impenetratable, the narrative and dialogue are schizophrenic. The tone and attitude of the tale fluctuates between a pompous 50's puritanism, and an overtly misogynistic sexual bohemia, which 60 years later is comical.But don't get me wrong, I loved it. Marlowe steps off the page and into your head. He is brought to life by Chandler's dexterous turn of phrase, and insightful observation, both of which are as unexpected, as they are delicious.Chapter 22 pg 149 ""I got up on my feet. I was as dizzy as dervish, as weak as a worn-out washer, as low as a badger's belly, as timid as a titmouse, and as unlikely to succeed as a ballet dancer with a wooden leg"".It's a damm fine book.Incidentally it feels as if about a 1/4 of the book revolves around the lighting, smoking, and stubbing out of cigarettes; so if this book was written by the anti-tobbaco lobby it would be 60 pages shorter."
5,BACK AGAIN- AFTER 5 YEARS!!!!!!,"Chandler took off five years of writing novels.This was his fifth. It was published / written in1949. Another great, great job. A lot of womeninvolved in this story-line. And, of course, quitea few murders. Drinking, smoking, cops, doctors,movie business-types, they're all here."
2,Big Difference,"I was very disappointed with this Audio version, starring Toby Stephens, as Philip Marlowe.Those of us who have listened to the ""original"" BBC releases starring Ed Bishop, as Philip Marlowe, willquickly notice the differences in these two voices.It just isn't the same."
5,Some of the best English prose available,"The writing is modern English at its absolute best; the insights into human nature are reminiscent of Faulkner or Shakespeare, though delivered at a different pitch. It is a most convoluted and bizarre plot even by Chandler's bizarre standards, and post-war L.A. has rarely seemed more peculiar. One of my favorite scenes is the old studio owner with his dogs in the courtyard. Why is Marlowe so often doped up by corrupt doctors? All in all, this just trails FAREWELL MY LOVELY as my favorite Chandler."
3,"Chandler is Great, But do not Start Here!","As always, Raymond Chandler's writing technique is excellent in ""The Little Sister."" And while the premise is good--- a woman from Kansas coming to Philip Marlowe in hopes of locating her missing brother--- the story and its characters dissolve into eccentricity by the end of the book.Chandler was such an excellent story teller, and part of his appeal was writing colorful mysteries that had the right mix of gritty reality and just a few dashes of improbable situations. The characters in this book start off well, but become more cartoonish as the story moves along.In my opinion, there is no terrible Raymond Chandler book, but this does come close. If you have never read any of Chandler's work, this may not be the best place to start. ""Farewell, My Lovely"" and ""The High Window"" would be my personal picks as his finest work, but any of his other novels are superior to this."
3,half a chandler,if you love raymond chandler like i do you'll still enjoy his not so great works and this is one of em...enjoy...
5,Wonderful mixture of Bach transcriptions,"All of Robert Hill Bach CDs that I own are a pure delight. This release contains Bach keyboard pieces that he transcribed from other composers as well as Hill's transciption of Bach's orchestral works. They are lov ingly played one regular and lute-harpsichord, clavicord. The hallmark of the bach releases are the notes in which Hill tells why he used the instruments and an explanation of the frequencty of Baroque trancripion."
5,BORK DELIVERS!,"I got this CD thinking it would be funny, and it is. Bork's nightclub show sounds like a visit to the boardwalk fun house! I wish I had seen it. ""Sheena"" sounds like Tim Curry in ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show!"" And Nurse Hooker sounds like...well...um....a hooker! Best is the ""Mother Trucker"" song. Bork plays great ragtime keyboard too, and has a great band. The Elephant Man song is my daughter's favorite. She and her girlfriends go around the house singing it all the time. I bought two more of these for presents, and I also have his other CD ""Get Lei'd"" and it's just as good! ""Fugue You!"" is great fun AND great music! FIVE STARS!"
5,Mind Your Language,Enjoyed it thoroughly. Artfully demonstrate how language wrongly pronounced can lead to trouble or even disaster.sharing with relatives and friends.
5,Razrwire is the BOMB!!!,I love my Razrwire sunglasses with bluetooth.. They are awesome and easy to use. I wish they had interchangeable lenses so you could wear them at night too.... Totally great product!
3,Drilling tactics,"So few reviews for this classic! (In fact, most are listed under ""One thousand and one..."".). Not a bad book, but I'd point out:1. This is fairly challenging. You can cherry pick the easy sections, but many problems will be very frustrating for <1600.2. Great bargain, but given how long it takes to get through, I'd personally pay twice as much for algebraic notation, cleaner diagrams, etc.3. Are tactics 99% chess? People often conflate tactics with calculation and blunders. Solitaire chess style books (e.g., Barden's) provide better practice calculating, IMO, and are less artificial. Short games/mimiatures books give you fewer exercizes, but let you see the build-up, which is nice."
4,"très bon texte, mauvais livre","Livre livré dans les délais, en état neuf comme indiqué dans la description. Le texte en lui-mme vaut 5 étoiles, mais vu la mauvaise qualité de la couverture, le nombre anormalement élevé de coquilles et les erreurs de formatage du texte je conseille fortement aux acheteurs de privilégier une autre édition (Folio ou Livre de Poche, par exemple)."
2,Not much scent,I bought these for my sister to make scented rice bags to use for aching muscles. The lavender did not have much of a scent at all.
1,Hip Hop? umm....no.,"By calling this music hip-hop, he's insulting a whole culture of people. There must be a genre of music OTHER THAN hip-hop that this could be categorized under hmmm....maybe the ""Confused-Old-White-Man-That-Just-Heard-Of-Hip-Hop-A-Year Ago"" genre. To be the most accurate, I would have to say that this is what music sounds like if you were to cryogenically freeze a musician from the sixties, then unthaw him in 2003 and try to explain hip hop to him. There's nothing more dreadful than hearing an old white man try to rap. Another thing, what's with the album cover? Is it called 'Rock around the clock forever'? Is it called 'Hip Hoppin' the rock'? Maybe it's called livin' in a hip-hop world? Guess what people........Joey Welz definately isn't."
5,3 CDs! A great buy!,"This is a really worthy collection to be called ""Ultimate""!You get some tracks here that can be really hard to find and some of them are long original versions. To top it up this collection has been remastered with a new great sound! Some of the tracks really needed the lift. Nothing to complain about here, the package is really nice gatefold with a great rarely seen picture of Donna, she looks stunning as always!You really should get this one before it gets deleted!Just so you don't have to pay a fortune for it on E-Bay(!)Get it!"
5,To quote Donna 'You got those kinda eyes',What can I say.Five stars just for the cover alone.The cover of this set floored me.Theres Donna Summer looking at me with blue eyes.'Blue Eyes'Like Frank Sinatra.Donna is going down in history just like Old Blue Eye's himself.She has a one of a kind voice.This set just like all others that proceed it is here to remind us of that.
3,Mixed Bag,"Some these essays are great and others are absurd. Esposito is incredible as usual, and the the other contributors shine at time as well. However, some contributors (e.g., Elmessiri of Cairo Universiry who expands his definition of secularism so far as to render the word utterly meangingless) spout nonsense and seem to have a total lack of comprehension of what secularism means. Indeed, if there would be one major flaw of the work, it would be the lack of a working definition of secularism throughout. This makes it a frustrating read at times, but nonetheless, its a rewarding effort and a worthy buy."
2,very poor picture quality,"My vhs tape had very poor picture quality, almost unwatchable. Since these sellers offer no picture, I`m wondering if it is by the same company. I love Barbara Steele and I think the movie was good, but It was hard to follow because of the poor quality. Not a good buy for the price. Would have rated it much higher if the quality was better."
1,Don't buy this product!!,This player stopped working after 4 months (one month over warranty). The changer threw all the CD's out and jammed the unit. The door wouldn't open. It was a total disaster.
1,Broken out of the box,"Unpacked this player, hooked it up, loaded a DVD, and immediately received a ""Disc Error"" message on the display. No matter what kind of disk I loaded, CD-R, music CD, DVD, got the same message. Also, the carousel would spin endlessly once I ejected the disks. Talked to Toshiba customer service, and they were of no help, just suggested I bring it in to an authorized service center. I've found that to be their standard answer for everything, unfortunately.This is my second bad experience with a Toshiba DVD player. A single disk player I bought stopped working at 13 months (1 month out of warranty) which is why I bought this one. I was going to chalk it up to an isolated case, but with the performance of this new one, I'm thinking it is not that isolated. Will be buying another brand now."
4,nice,Smedes has written a book on the 5 moral commandments and does a decent job arguing his point. I enjoyed the topic and appreciate his attention to detail.
3,eBook font has a problem,Book is good but the kindle ebook font is hard to read. It is not regular font. Some are clear some are fade out.
3,Product delivered was different from displayed,The product was different from that gold colored 23-1 displayed. I got a plastic product which am yet to discover if it actually reads XD cards.
5,The Gospel on Competition,"Prof. Porter's work on competition in industry is a milestone and after two decades still holds its ground. I had his textbook for my MBA class well over a decade ago. His recent (Harvard Bus. Rev - March 2001) article regarding 'Strategy and the Internet' shows that the fundamental principles of Competitive Strategy is still valid as ever in the ""new economy""."
5,"Finally, a real definition of competitive advantage.","Michael Porter clearly explains why having competitors is good, and why having them closer is better! Society improves by innovations caused by competition, and this happens faster and farther in clusters. This book also explains why joint ventures will become a more important business structure. I especially like the the idea that a better future depends on matching the culture of the business and the values of the people to foster more opportunity. Every executive in a consolidating industry should read this book."
4,Great Stroller!!,"I brought this stroller for my son of 6 months ....it's a great stroller to go out shopping, park, etc., but the only thing about it that i don't like is it doesn't recline back ...my son looks so uncomfortable sleeping in it...but the only advantage of this stroller...it's very lightweight, and convenient. I recommend it for quick getaways...-From,The gonzalez family"
3,"Not great, but okay",We have a travel system and we purchased this stoller mainly for quick trips here and there. Our son attends daycare at a large community center and we also wanted something to helps us easily get in and out of the building. We purchased this stoller in blue and have been using it for about a month. For the first three weeks it seemed to get the job done. . . .it's nothing fancy but it worked. Within the last week we began to notice that it was getting harder and harder to collapse and now the latch it stuck. I've called the company and we are going to return it and look into purchasing a different model.
2,Not worth it,"I bought this stroller when my son outgrew the infant carrier and we no longer needed the travel system. It's very flimsy. The canopy almost never stays in place, and ripped after 2 weeks. The wheels constantly lock up. We ended up returning it and buying the Chicco C5. It was about $30.00 more but well worth it. It's light and fits easily in the trunk."
2,Only for short kids,"My son is 2 1/2 and we went to Babies R Us to try out several lightweight strollers for trips to the mall or even to go for a long walk. This one LOOKED great, folded up SUPER easy, he fit great in it, until I flipped the sunshade over and it was resting on his head. He's only 3 feet tall. I tried to mess with it to get the sunshade off but ultimately I gave up on it. I WANTED To make it work because all of the other reviews on this stroller were so positive, but it didn't work for my toddler."
2,Wonderful at first,This stroller was great at first. We loved it for a while but as our daughter got older and bigger the seat started to fall apart. Now our daughter who just turned two is barely 24 pounds. Size wise she is small. But she can get in and out of strollers herself. On the part where the child sits the two bars that hold the fabric in place started to rip the fabric not even six months after we purchased the stroller. It has now been eight months and we had to go buy a new stroller because the fabric had ripped so much our daughter started slipping out of the stroller and got her foot caught in the wheels.
4,"Great stroller, especially for tall parents!","I love my chicco stroller. The handles are at a perfect height for me 5'8. The wheels also make the stroller easy to handle and the fact that it is an umbrella stroller that reclines is a + in my book. The only reason I did not give it 5 starts is because of the sunshade, mind bent and kept hitting my son in the head so I had to remove it. This may have been my fault because I had instlled a cup holder which also fell off. Aside from that it's a sturdy lightweight stroller which I still use and my son is 40 pounds and almost 5 years old. It also comes in super cute bright colors. This stroller also works to carry my groceries when my son is awake :o)I would buy this again with my new baby due this year."
2,it's okay,"The stroller does beat the average $20 stroller because it does unzipper and lays back a bit. It has a small basket underneath but it's better than nothing. As far as the canopy, it drives my crazy cause it slides off and there's no way to keep it from doing that when you put it back behind the baby, even when you try to bend the front of the canopy. It does fold easy and is compact. But I don't think i would really recommend this stroller to anyone."
4,Great stroller except for the canopy,"I am the stroller queen and have owned several between my 6 year old and 3 1/2 year old. This is stroller is great, light weight, attractive, safe, tough, except for the canopy. If you don't want to use the canopy and fold it back, it continually slips off the frame. Since I live in Florida and use the canopy more often than not, it is not a huge issue. However, if you think you wouldn't use the canopy that often you might want to reconsider!"
4,"Great, lightweight stroller","I bought this stroller not expecting much because of the cheap price, but I have to say it is a lot better than I expected. My six month old does well in it and likes it better than the big stroller he was used to. My only complaint is that it is difficult to collapse (easy to unfold though) because you have to use your hand to unlatch the lock so you can fold it. Other than that it is a breeze."
4,Arrived in pieces...,"My only problem with this stroller was the fact that it came completely broken. Fortunately, I was able to take it to Babies R Us for an even exchange.Cup holders would be nice... I love the 5-point harness and the convenience of the straps... I've gotten lots of compliments on it and ""I wish I had that one.."" type remarks!"
2,Regret getting it,"This was our second light weight stroller that we bought when our first child was 24 months old. Our major reasons purchasing it were the reclining capability, light weight, rain cover, big wheels, wider seats and much lower price tag than the other popular ones (such as Combi, Maclaren and Peg Perego). We thought we got a real good deal for the money... but now the child is 40 months and the stroller was falling apart and we had to buy yet another light weight - Maclaren Triumph, hoping it'll be our last one! The problems with the Chicco Capri stroller are 1)the canopy is useless and does not stay in place when it's not being used, 2) it's very hard to push and does not maneuver well with a child over 35 pounds, 3)wheels lock up often with a heavier child. In retrospect, we should've spent the money and bought a more sturdy ligh weight stroller to last 3 toddler hoods!"
3,Average stroller,The canopy on this stroller constantly slips off when it is in the down position. I also things the wheels are positioned too close together.
5,A Great Stroller,"We had been looking for a compact, light, sturdy stroller, and fell in love with this as soon as we saw it. We love that it has a canopy and basket underneath. I like how the canopy's edge folds up just a little. I do wish the basket was a little more accessable. I had to un-velcro the front to get in it. It is a huge space-saver in our trunk. Both my husband and I are comfortable pushing it, I'm 5'5, he's 5'11. On a lighter note, its the same stroller they use in the movie ""Meet The Fockers"", LOL."
5,It's addictive......the good kind,"Our family is having so much fun playing this. And once our friends play, they announce that they've GOT TO GET THEIR OWN GAME. The rules are few, each game has its own challenges and it can be enjoyed by young to older. We love/prefer having the large mat version.We like this set because the chips are different on each side, which makes it easy to identify where a sequence has been completed. GREAT GAME."
4,great,"it is everything i expected everything is bigger, the only thing i dont like about it is the board itself. its made out of like a strong paper like material that can roll up inside the can, i would have prefered for it to be made of cardboard but i geuss it wouldnt have been able to fit inside the tube lol, but outside of that its a great buy"
5,BIG FUN!!,"We had the regular size Sequence, but when we played in larger groups, it was hard to see the board. JUMBO Sequence definitely remedied that situation! The beauty of this game is that it can be played by all age groups (we had from 8 to 49) and can be enjoyed by all. Great toy to learn strategy and help observation skills. LOVE IT!"
5,Juego Familiar,"Este juego tienes bastantes años y siempre gusta jugar entre amigos y familiares, siempre lo llevo cuando hay actividades es un gran entretenimiento y muy divertido. Este modelo es el ideal se ve muy bien hasta en personas mayores así todos se divierten."
3,sequence,"We first played this game at a friends house and because it was fun, purchased it for ourselves.We played sequence again last night with another couple, and they too liked it. It makes you think and use strategy to win the game. We played for about 2 1/2 hours."
4,Sequence Jumbo Tube Too Jumbo,"The game itself is great but it certainly does not need this huge tube to hold it, and it takes up to much space if you store the game in it. Toss the Tube.The board is now big enough for the 6-10 people we have to play it. The smaller board version requires a lot of reaching and tossing of the chips which makes a mess."
5,Sequence Game -fast delivery,I was really surprised to get exactly what I ordered. This was my frist time topurchase from Amazon.com. It arrived in 2 days instead of the advertized 5-8 days.It was about $22.00 cheaper than I could get at manufacture. And it shipped for free.Our family is very happy with the product and the Amazon folks that worked behind the scenes.Would I do this again ...... you bet!
5,"Sequence, a fun game","Very good game and we love the Jumbo size game. Being older folks, we get jumbo cards to use with it. Our friends had to have one after playing ours. Recommend it highly."
5,Great for Anyone,This board makes it some much easier to play Sequence. My grandparents own one and have given multiple boards to their friends who also play the game.
5,Wow! What Fun!!!,"I bought a regular edition of Sequence with the fold up board but it was really too small to enjoy. Decided to try the Jumbo version. Wow, what a difference! Everyone we've introduced the game to has become an instant fan.Here's a hint- spend the money on the Jumbo version that comes in the tube since the mat comes rolled up instead of folded like the one that comes in the box. Those creases in the (boxed ) mat will drive you crazy. It just won't lay flat like the rolled up version in the tube."
5,Love It,1I bought this for a friend. I had already bought one for my self. It is the right size to play on.
5,Family entertainment,"As a family toy...we really don't look at it as toy though.....but it's a reall family get-together game....highly recommend it....but I would recommend the players be at least 13 yrs old and ""understand"" what playing cards mean....otherwise.....you''ll be continuously explaining what's happening....anyone that plays cards will thoroughly enjoy this game....you can play with two people but don't recommend it....4 people is ideal....then you've got teams...and that's really fun."
5,Awesome.,One of our favorite games. The size is big! Takes up our entire coffee table but it is perfect size for a regular table. I am going to purchase a smaller version too for when we play in the living room. If you have never played this you should buy it. I would suggest buying an electric card shuffler. The cards need to be shuffled really well if your playing with just two people.
5,Great game for 2 or 12,If you like this game (and it comes in many formats) be sure to buy this jumbo board. Makes the game so much easier to see and play.Gwen in FL
5,Loads of Fun!,"Sequence is a fantastic card game. Everyone should play it at least once. If you do, you won't be able to stop at just one game. I would recommend Sequence to everyone."
3,Nice,"Big, okay, coils, I need 17 more words to submit this review, so Here goes. It is worth the price."
5,Waiting for more,"Ok, so it wasn't Frank Herbert and it wasn't perfect. But it's still the best Dune book since Chapter House and they are bound to get better. So stop the negative comments and let's hope the publisher lets them continue. Besides, Brian admits the 3 prequels were not his first interest. He just needed a best seller to permit him to publish future books on the Butlerian Jihad...and I am looking forward to reading those."
1,"Entertaining, no Dune","Entertaining sci-fi novel for readers who enjoy the genre, very disappointing for someone hoping to relive the ""Dune experience"". House Atreides completely lacks the depth, complexity and intensity which made Frank Herbert's books thought-provoking as well as enjoyable. While I appreciate the authors' effort, I don't plan to read the other planned Dune prequels."
1,Shouldn't even get one star,"This book is TERRIBLE. Sure--no one expected it to be on the level of his father's books, but WOW, this is BAD. I'm not sure who to blame--I have a feeling Anderson did most of the writing and Brian just threw his name on for more punch.If you are a fan of Dune don't even bother picking this book up. The brilliance of the original series was that it lifted the story out of the realm of ""sci-fi"" and into something that was bigger and better. This book takes the original story and pulls it back down among the masses of other pulp, shoddily wirtten sci-fi cr@p. Too bad.....Frank's probably rolling in his grave right now. Poor guy. Poor me for actually reading this cover to cover..."
4,Compelling and Well-written,"I think Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson took on a heck of a challenge, with hundreds of thousands of DUNE fans expecting something as good as, or better than, the original. And, I must say, they came very close. The pre-Paul Atreides/Muad'ib/Kwisatz Haderach era was put together in a suspenseful and comprehensive way. DUNE is still DUNE, but House Atreides is a masterpiece in it's own right."
3,Fan but not fanatic,"I am a passive fan of Dune. I was turned on to the series by my Dad, a long time SF reader, during a family vacation which included long periods of driving. Although I enjoyed Dune, I never read on in the series. That said, I found House Atreides to be an enjoyable read. I found inconsistancies in this novels attempt to cast light on events preceeding the events of Dune. However, I have chosen not to pick the novel apart. I enjoyed discovering how the Baron became the disgusting blob that he is, where Lady Jessica came from, and the background of Duncan Idaho. These revelations are interesting and fun. The average reader does not need ""The nit-pickers guide to Dune"" to enjoy this book."
2,House Atreides,The sublety and dark complexity of the original Dune novels is absent here...the clumsiness and cliche apparent in this book made it a sad disappointment. Only the names remain the same... do yourself a favor and read Dune again.
4,Nice lead in to new series,It's written alright and I enjoy some of the threads that come out in later books but might be reaching point of Dune fatigue. I think they might have written some of the characters as maybe a little to one dimensional but do enjoy the stories of IX.
1,Not your Daddy's Dune,"This book is dreadful. Brian and Kevin should feel ashamed at writing such dull prose. This turns the previous books of a master into nothing more than a franchise. It was so dreadful a read, I cannot be bothered......"
2,Not worthy.,"I found this book to be lacking in most areas. While mildly entertaining, the writing was amateurish. And worst of all, you'd swear this was fan fiction from some teenager. Not very true to Frank Herbert's vision at all."
2,It's not Frank,"The best thing about this novel is that it will renew interest in the original. It made me go back and reread Dune and marvel at how beautifully written and conceived it all was. This book breaks no new ground, offers few insights and the writing is stilted. Too bad, we miss Frank Herbert very much."
4,Wait and See,"I have read a number of the comments that people have written on this page and realized that, unlike the original Dune series written by Frank Herbert, these new prequel books may not ""stand alone"" as some people would like them too. I suggest that everyone wait and read ALL of the books in the prequel before they opine about anything. I'm sure that when DUNE itself first came out people didn't see how it would fit in the Sci Fi universe but after 5 more books and a somewhat random movie, they finally understood what Frank Herbert was trying to say. So just wait and see..."
3,First prequel has engaging plot but lacks style,"For a Dune fan, House Atreides is a fun read. You get to find out all sorts of interesting history about many of the great characters from the original. The plot is extremely complicated, but not so much that you can't understand what's going on.My main cricism with the book is that it lacks the depth and style of the original series by Frank Herbert. The writing style is simple - basically just plot and characters. There's not a whole lot of depth to any of the characters, and it lacks the philosophical and political insights of the original. Still, the storyline is engaging enough to keep you reading, and it's fun it find out some of the past events that led up to the original novel. You get to find out, for example, why the Baron is so fat (it's not just from eating too much, if that's what you're thiking). I think this is a worthy read for any Dune fan - but it should not be read before the original."
3,"Nice setup, sorta fell flat there at the end.","Writing a book against Frank Herbert's masterpiece is no easy task. The authors make a valiant attempt and come away with something that's a nice Saturday afternoon read, but nothing that I'd re-read again and again (as I have Dune).The most disappointing thing is that the book just kind of falls apart at the end. There's no punch. No sense of ""Wow"" when you put it down. All kinds of setup is done for the next book in the series, but since it's a shallow attempt...the interest just doesn't carry."
3,Caricature Developement,"I have to admit, I wolfed this book down. It was nice to be back in the Dune world.But the quality of the writing left much to be desired. There's a lot more Caricature Developement vs. character development.You know, the Barron is a sick-o (he's so sick there's no way he could really be a credible threat!). Leto is just sooo noble. The Freeman as sooo free! On and on."
4,House Atreides,"I've reading and re-reading the Dune books of Frank Herbert so many times, that I know all the characters as part of my friends. Usualy I read in italian, but since the novel is not available in my language I went through the book in english. This book isn't one of the originals, but it brings you back to the planet of Arrakis with a very good aproach. The story is good and, since it's a precuel, you already know where thing will conduce you at the end of the trilogy. I felt my self home travelling again through the sands of Dune, and learning about the characters that will be older during the original books. The stories of Duncan Idaho, C'Tair, etc are well developed. I substance it's a good book that has to be read by any Dune fan."
4,Good but leaves space for another before Dune.,"I enjoyed it even if it wasn't ""pure"" Dune. They gave it a good shot. But, there are still alot of unanswered questions and intrigues left hanging. Does this mean another book will be written?"
5,Awesome prequel with its own style.,"This book weaves an intricate storyline which not only stands fully on its own, but works in tantilizing glimpses of your favorite character's beginnings. A studly, fashionable Baron Harkonnen? A Harkonnen daughter? Oh yeah, the foundations for the Dune series come from believable, but unexpected directions. I pity those other reviewers who actually expected some kind of Dune 0.5 beta, rehash of what's already been written. I read this book in two days, I couldn't put it down."
3,'Herbert-Lite' Has It's Moments.,"Reasonably well written by two talented individuals, with some good ideas (but I wonder what F. Herbert would think). BUT: Unlike Herbert senior's ability to keep disparate plot threads fairly relevant and synchronized, this book is a bit muddled and disjointed and even plods in places. It's hard to see how they can keep a trilogy going at this pace. But with K.J. Anderson's experience with pace and action, that could change. Though Brian Herbert will have to ensure it remains a true collaboration and not let Anderson, with the best of intentions, create a Star Wars-like space opera set in a Frank Herbert universe. No, I'm not trying to pigeon hole KJA, but his style IS a distinctive one. Still, we should not expect these writers to create a 'Duncan Idaho-Herbert' clone. And the signs are favorable that they will not. I give the men a B-minus."
4,Hey! This Aint That Bad-,"I guess it has become hip to come down on prequels. Hey folks, both the Phantom Menace and Dune: House Atreides are not that bad. Don't be fickle and fall into what a some booklist says or some critic spouts off because they want to be cool. Grand in scope like Dune? No. Rambling, confusing prose that will lose the wierdest of the wierd? No. What you do get is a plainly written, factual prequel of what takes place before Dune. In this book we gets to see the origns of Duke Leto, Duncan Idaho, Baron Harkonnen, Mother Superior Gaius Helen Mohaim among others. I really don't understand what is so wrong with this book. I have read it straight through and I find it an entertaining yarn. It certanly answers many questions that I had about the Dune books. Not the greatest novel ever written, but a solid read that does not deserve the Lynchesque scorn and derision it has received."
2,iffy,"Storyline- B+. It could've been exciting if FH dictated it, because it is a good story, but the writing was monotonous. There was frequent sidetracks with obvious information repeated again and again.Writing- D-. Paragraphs full of 3rd person thoughts that are so irrelevant. Hardly any dialouge. Chapters average about 3-6 pages long and ALWAYS switch to a new place every time. Characters are ""paper thin"" as another reviewer put it.There are some parts in the book that are exciting and almost feel like Dune but it really comes off like a book for a 12 or 13 year old. It took me a good 2 months to finish it because I had to force myself to read through it. I really wouldn't recommend this book to anyone but I heard the same thing from people and I still read it anyway. The next book in the series will be better, have hope."
4,An Admirable Effort,This book lacks the complexity of emotion and Frank Herbert's remarkably keen insight into human nature that made the original Dune such an amazing book. However it is imminently readable if not the masterpiece on what it is based. And because it is faithfully set in one of the richest and most beloved universes in the science-fiction canon it is transformed from a pleasant piece of fiction into a joyous undertaking. Highly recommended to anyone who has been enchanted by Arrakis and the universe within which it is contained.
4,A story about young Leto-hope there's a sequel,I enjoyed getting into young Leto's head. The book seems to be part of a series as it keeps several threads dangling.
2,Glad I didn't buy it,"As a seperate work of science fiction, this book would be quite good. However, because of the fact that it is intended to be part of a previously-written epic, _Dune: House Areides_ falls far short of expectations. It is utterly lacking in Frank Herbert's vision, breadth and scope, and just a few cursory glances at the _Dune Encyclopedia_ reveals several major errors in character backgrounds (Duncan Idaho never lived on Geidi Prime, for example) and numerous other inconsistencies.I suppose no other sci-fi author could ever begin to compete with Frank Herbert on his own turf. It may have been better if this book had not been written. It cannot compare favorably to any of the others in the series, and will always stand in the shadow of the grandeur of Frank Herbert's creation.For a book that is supposedly based on Frank Herbert's notes and ""recently discoverd files,"" this novel displays surprisingly little insight and/or character and historical knowledge of the series."
2,Dune Lite,"It's been a while since I last read any of the Dune books, but they were so classic that when House Atreides came out, I avoided it since I figured it would never measure it. Well, after tripping it across it at the library, I decided to risk it since it wouldn't involve any money.It turned out that my preconceptions were pretty much correct. Perhaps they were self-fulfilling and I merely got what I expected. Nevertheless, this book just didn't seem to have any of the texture that the original Dune books had, none of the depth. Or in a sound bite, this is ""Dune lite"".I imagine that if I was high-school age, a time when I read sf voraciously and was a bit less discriminating, I'd love this. These days I'm a lot more picky, and aside from some from a few sparks in the chapters about Pardot Kynes, this book just didn't do anything for me."
2,"OK for pop sci-fi, but not worthy of Dune name","This book is OK if all you are looking for is a possible history of the events preceding Dune, but the writing leaves a lot to be desired. It's written along the lines of the Star Wars type books, and comes across almost like a comic book with very cardboard characters. There are too many references to 20th century pop culture ideas (e.g. feng shui, thinking outside the box, etc...), and it attempts to make all the characters fit in line with their representation in the movie."
2,let down,"I'm the biggest Dune fan, read 10 dune books already but this was my least favorite. None of the events which took place were too surprising and it was written poorly."
1,don't bother...,"This book, and the others of its ilk by Kevin J. and Brian Herbert, are nothing more (and considerably less) than cashing in on the Dune mystique. It reads like it was written by a wannabe fanboy, and the story has lost all of the Dune ""magic"" that Frank Herbert put into his stories. Regardless of whether or not Brian was in on where his father wanted to go with his stories, it's obvious that he (and his ""assistant/compatriot/whatever"", Kevin J.) are incapable of living up to those ideas.This book gets by the same way that the new Star Wars prequels have, by riding on the sentimental attachments that fans have for the originals. I got rid of my copies of the House books after reading them, and stopped even thinking about buying any more of these attrocities. If you like Dune at all, just re-read the originals...."
5,This book satisfied my need for more Dune material,What else do I need to say? I am a Dune series junky having read all of the books several times and this prequel satisfied my need for more Dune material. I look for more from this pair of authors!
4,A keeper!,"A great scifi book! It is imaginative with a variety of interesting characters and situations. I think the book holds it own, if you choose to compare it with any of the original ""Dune"" books In the end it is eminently readable...one of those books that you look forward to flying through a couple chapters each day."
1,One star is too high a rating for this book,"Frank Herbert's Dune is perhaps the best science fiction book ever written in my opinion. So who wouldn't want a nice prequel to the original? Well, believe me, you don't want to waste your time.Here's what's wrong:* The story is shallow and unsatisfying.* The characters are poorly written and totally unlike the very same characters as created by Frank Herbert.* The plot meanders around with very little interest going on. The things that happen are totally out of line with the other Dune books.There was hardly a chapter that didn't disappoint me. I can't believe I read the whole thing! Arghhhh!"
3,Not a real Dune book...,"Okay, it's definitely a book about Dune, and set in the Duniverse, and it has all the terminology of a Dune book...but it's not a real Dune Book. Period. Don't get me wrong, I read it and I liked it, but it has NONE of the depth of any of the original series. Even weaker books in the original series tower over House Atreides. The best sections of the book are those that involve situations discussed directly in the other books, i.e. those where the authors had Frank Herbert's hand guiding them. Many of the newer charactors (especially Rhombur Vernius) fall flat and are poorly fleshed out and just plain uninteresting.Frank Herbert is sorely missed. I went right from finishing this book to re-reading Dune!"
3,Very accessible and not to bad (regarding its not Frank),"This book an easy read where the original Dune books ar much more complex. The original books remain interesting after the first read, and one still discovers new things on second or sometimes third read. House Atreides holds a lot of interesting background info on Frank's universe. And I liked that. The end was a bit to ""easy"" in my opinion. But remember this is not Frank. Rate the book on its own merits. Then it is a decent read."
1,DUNE ... NOT!,"I agree with all of the negative comments below.When I heard that there would be a new Dune novel, I went back and re-read all 6 of the originals, just to refresh my memory of Dune.After the first chapter of ""House Atreides"" I realized that this book was NOTHING close to the original. The narrative style is repetitive, and written for early teen readers. The errors made, with regards to the Dune universe, are so frequent and so glaring as to totally detract from the reading experience. The only reason I finished the book was so that I could warn other people about it.DO NOT buy this book if you enjoyed any of the originals. If you have not read any of the originals then start with Dune and NEVER read this book. I have never thrown a book away, this will be the first, and I will NOT buy any of the sequels."
2,Bleh,"To say this is the best of the trilogy isnt' saying much. Terrible writing, and the fact that I see nothing of the characters from his father's work, despite the names benig the same, is a tragedy. Avoid all of Herbert and Anderson's dreck."
3,"Not the Best, but Not Bad, Either","Dune: House Atreides is, of course, the first of a threevolume prequel to Frank Herbert's classic novel, Dune.The point of the novel is to give ""backstory"" to the eventsin the elder Herbert's work. It certainly succeeds in explaininga great deal of things -- there are numerous ""oh, so THAT'Swhy..."" moments in the novel.But its not great stuff. There are numerous stories going on,and, despite the fact they are ultimately interwoven, there'sa feeling that you're reading an anthology of short storiesand not a novel.On the plus side, while the novel can't be said to live upto the quality of the original ""Dune"", it is more entertaining,and accessible, than Frank Herbert's own sequels, especiallythe almost painfully dull ""God Emperor of Dune"".If you enjoyed the original novel, and want more, thisis a good choice -- better than the original sequels."
4,Dune for the laymen,"I understand that, perhaps too often, the Dune 'elite' sneer in contempt at anyone who hasn't read at least the original 6 DUNE books. Likewise, I also understand that it may indeed be a struggle for the casual reader to wade through the immense imagination and genius that was and is Frank Herbert. To the point, HOUSE ATREIDES is akin to a somewhat diluted form of the original DUNE series. Some might find that to be a rub against the book, however, I actually found it a bit more enjoyable and much less tedious than some of the original volumes. I did miss the ever-present aura of the un-known that permeates Frank Herbert's original series, however, the trade was acceptable to me. If you've read all of the other books, read this series too. If you haven't read all of the others, these may inspire you toward that endeavor."
1,Did the authors read the original Dune books???,"I did not hope the new book would be equal to the original, but please keep the details straight and logical. I like the character of Duncan Idaho very much, so I paid attention to his background in the original books. He had a sister who died in the Harkonnen slave pit. He was saved by Duke Leto or Duke Leto's father from the Harkonnen slave pit. In this book, he has ""NO"" sister. Instead, his parents were killed by the Harkonnen. The slave pit was not a slave pit; it was more like a prison where people were waiting around to be executed (or freed). And Duncan was not rescued. He escaped there himeself. The woman who helped him to escape had the most ridiculous reason to help him and send him to the House Atreides. I did not check for other conflicting details. Since Duncan Idaho was one of the main characters for 4 of the 6 books of Dune, getting his background wrong was really ridiculous."
2,Fan Fiction?,"Maybe its the fact that I hold Dune to be the best novel I've ever read, maybe its Brian Herbert's different writing style. I don't know, but what I do know is that this book stunk. I forced myself to finish it. My first thought was that this book read like a star trek/star wars novel. And what do you know? It was co-authored by a novelist who has in the past written those kinds of books! It held none of the magic that the original Dune series. None. Not a drop. I'd only recommend this book to those of you who actually read the ENTIRE Dune series, but please..buy the paperback..it's not worth 25 dead presidents. Word to the wise, continuations of a series after the original author has died are bad ideas. (just look at the continuing 'Foundation' books by the 'estate' of Isaac Asimov) Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go hurl this book into the open desert and collect my water-debt from Brian Herbert's hide."
3,"A nice filler, somewhat inacurate, much less complex.","I loved ""Dune: House Atreides"". There were a couple of things that bothered me though.One is that near the end A priest of Dur was mentioned, but Dur is the shortening of Guldur (Heritics of Dune)a Gammu name for the God Emperor who was born thousands of years after this.Two is the seeming common Knowledge that the Tleilaxu are religeous Fanatics but that was kept a total secret by the Tleilaxu until Taraza interragated Waff (Heritics of Dune). They kept a facade of amorality (Neither moral nor immoral / without moral principles) until that point.One thing that was not wrong but still something I wished for, I had hoped that Idaho would turn out to be an illegitamit son of Palus or Leto. thus a rationalzation of Idaho's rampant gholaing and special abilities. But that was quashed.A good read, but Don't expect FH's Dune"
3,Yamabushi's mini reviews XXVII,"3 1/2. Well crafted and well written, were given insights into the Dune characters and their motivations. But what I found even more interesting was the look at the universe of Dune. Many things left un-elaborated on by Frank are explained and expanding upon here. Good stuff."
5,The middle of the epic saga: House Atreides,"Dune is the greatest epic story ever told. House Atreides is but a single link in the long chain that is the Duniverse; it is the first in the trilogy, but it is the middle of the story. If you are new to Dune, this is not the best place to start the story.The writing style of young Herbert and Anderson is much more accessible and with smoother cadence capable of quickly engulfing the reader. This amazing story is a component of the overall outline that Frank Herbert had planned. Although the writing is different, it is not hard to imagine that Frank himself had written every word.Dune is a brilliant work of art that puts the very soul of humanity under a microscope and analyzes what it means to be human while painting a rich and beautiful universe in our far off future."
4,So Brian's not Frank. Read it anyway.,"I came into this prequel with a lot of preconceived notions that it would not be a worthy successor to the original. And it isn't. But after a second reading, I realized it's not supposed to be. ""House Atreides"" is a prequel, not a sequel. It's supposed to ""fill in the blanks"" of what happened before the greatest book in science fiction history. NO book can ever hope to live up to that kind of hype. But I believe Brian and Kevin do a masterful job of setting up things that we =know= are going to happen in later books without killing the suspense. There's whole new storylines to explore in this series, which they do later on. So Brian's not Frank. But he's working from Frank's notes with the aid of an author who is used to working in other people's universes. If you like ""Dune"" give this series a chance. I believe if you come into it with an open mind, you'll find it almost as entertaining as the original."
4,Very good!,"Of course it's not as good as the sixth book of the original serie, but it put light on the origin of some characters."
3,decent,"Look, I don't see how people reviewing this book expect Frank Herbert to get up from his grave and write another book. Cut it some slack. Obviously it's not going to be as serious as the others, lighten up people. It is a good book, an easy read, though not exactly what I expected, it still attempts to explain some things that Mr. Herbert and to put in an Appendix. I think the reason most people don't like this book is because it tries to oversimplify things, compared to the not-so-simplistic DC. For the authors, this is their first attempt at trying to write in the shadow of Mr. Herbert. Let's just see how the next book turns out before we pass total judgement on their writing style."
3,The Phantom Herbert,"This is a good book. It is not the original by any stretch, but, I think it derserves some credit for bringing us back to the world of Dune. Overall, I see teh negative comments on this book and the negative comments on SW: The Phantom Menace to be along the same lines. Remember that both came along after years of already determined outcomes, characters, and fan attachments. Both are constitantly out of style with the past(their future) works. Take the use of modern day slang in both. The ""Uh...""'s refered to in earlier comments. The Marv Albert like guy in Phantom Menace. Basically, just remember that this was intended to be the first in the long lline of saga ,and to view it in context that there are two(?) more stories to tell before we get to the original Dune."
3,Tantalizing,"When I saw this novel available, as a hard-core Dune fan, I HAD to have it. When I finally received it, I immediately curled up on the sofa by the fireplace and sat down to read. What I found was a mix of both insighful writing, flashes - almost echoes - of Frank Herbert's original ideas and phrasing, and unfortunately, jarring use of slang and interruptions in narrative flow. I enjoyed the long phrasing and flow of the original ""Dune"", and later, ""Heretics..."" and ""Chapterhouse."" This book occasionally went there, but the phrasing was too tight, too condensed at times to flow for me. As for the reviewer who thought the ""no-rooms"" concept was out of place, it was not. Remember Lucilla and Duncan in (I believe) ""Heretics""? An ancient Harkonnen no-room was the description given. Yes, enjoyable and a nice addition, but I hope that if there are any books forthcoming, they be more intense and elaborate."
1,Dune: House Atreides,"I'm a fan of the Dune series and have read them all. It took me awhile to get used to the writing but when I did I loved it. The elder Herbert didn't spoon feed the reader. The book & the world Arraksis are full of mystery and wonder. I felt the younger Herbert and this Anderson guy didn't do any of that. They lay everything out leaving no secrets, wonder or for that matter depth.If you've read the Dune series from Dune to Chapterhouse you know why Arraksis is a desert world. Why does the author have Kynes asking why? It just feels as though Frank Herbert would have taken a different, more satisfying approach. I've only read about 150 pages of this book and hate it. I'll suffer through it to see what happens (if I can). I'm just happy I got it from the library instead of spending the $20.Definitely two thumbs waaaaaay down."
4,Not bad,"Not a terrible piece of work by Brian Herbert. Certainly nowhere near the complexity or intricacy of his father's work in the original Dune series, but still an enjoyable read nonetheless. Herbert manages to spin a fairly interesting yarn concerning the events that predate the first Dune book. The timeframe involves a young Leto Atreides, before he takes over the role of Duke from his father, Paulus. The entire trilogy deals mainly with the polical movements and events of houses Atreides, Harkonnen, and Corrino (the Emperor), but many other smaller matters are addressed, such as Fremen developments on Dune, the Tlelaxu takeover of Ix, and of course the omnipresent Bene Gesserit.Once again, do not expect the in depth analysis of the interplay between politics, religion, and oracles that we got from Frank Herbert, but don't let that dissuade you from reading the series. Certainly worth the time for any Dune fan."
4,"A good read, but inherently strange....","If you like the Dune series, this book is worth it, if for no other reason than to return to the universe (which, if you're like me, you do often) I enjoyed it, but it felt ... wrong. It flowed strangely ... it seemed to lack the seriousness that marked Frank Herbert's work. All in all, good background for the Dune series, and I can't wait to see what else comes from the Herbert/Anderson collaboration. There is still alot of uncovered ground between ""House Atreides"" and the opening to ""Dune"". Enjoy."
4,"Nicely done, but not 'Dune'","I agree that this is a fun, fast-paced, complex and generally effective novel. Alas, I'm sorry that so little of it (relatively) takes place on Arrakis, which for my money is the most fascinating part of the original. Also, this book makes a reader see how the original relied overmuch on stereotypes of good vs. bad: I mean, come on, all the Atreides are super-good guys, and all the Harkonnens hideously depraved? Could do without the endless hammering on the fact that the evil Baron is gay, too. I realize that Frank Herbert made him so in the original, but here it sounds a little shrill and homophobic. Still, this is an enjoyable read, and I agree that it's as good or better than most of the 'Dune' sequels, excepting perhaps 'Children of Dune.'"
3,Pale reflection of the Original Series,"Dune: House Atreides brings us back to the landmark epicuniverse created by the late Frank Herbert. Although, it lacks thesubtle nuances and layers of the original series, it was enjoyableescapism. I enjoyed having the gaping holes filled in concerning thebackground of the various characters. I am planning to read its sisternovel Dune: House Harkonnen in the near future, with the hope that theauthors might improve on their first outting...but realisticly FrankHerbert is a tough act to follow. The authors should at least becommended for trying."
3,Dune: The master is missed...,"I did enjoy this installment of the Dune series if only to return back to the characters I've missed all these years. I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys the Dune series, just don't look for any new revelations and the writing takes a little getting used to. There seems to be a lot of repetition of facts through-out the novel."
5,A book that fills the voids,"It's hard following a master such as Frank Herbert. The pressure in comparisons would seem insurmountable. Yet having read this book I was amazed at the story line and depth to the characters. Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson fill in the gaps that are sorely lacking in the original masters. Duncan Idaho, Pardot Kynes and Prince Leto are given more depth defining there personna that will lead them to the decisions they make in the Dune Series. House Atreides also covers new or short referenced characters in detail. Duke Paulaus and Dominic Vernius and Emperor Elrod IV are just a few in this 600 paged novel. I especially enjoyed the portrayal of the Harkonnen line. Once and for all the reader learns just how evil the Harkonnen's have become. In summation, this is a must read, if I could have rated it six stars I would have."
3,Good Book that allows a return to the dune universe,"I think that anyone who has read Dune has a clear vision of that world and what it entails. If this same book was written by Frank Herbert, It would have had more depth and substance at the expense of plot. Unfortunately it was not and can never be. As a novel it is entertaining and fun to read, but it has more inconsistencies then I would prefer. There are certain plot lines that do not seem concordant with the original series. At any rate a must read for any fan of the original."
2,Phantom Menace without the special effects,"I had to re-read Dune after I finished HA to cleanse my spirit of a novel that, despite its intentions, cheapened Herbert's brilliant universe. For example, nowhere will you find Frank Herbert writing: ""The worm approached like a locomotive."" But this is the sort of uninspired writing you get for 600 full pages. The character subtleties, what there are of them, are explained away by an annoying narrator as though the novel were meant for children. Don't read unless you enjoyed a similarly bad prequel: Phantom Menace."
1,Brian is not Frank,"When I read Brian's books, I though it was a parallel Dune where characters are simple and contradicts what happen in classic Dune."
4,This was a good read...,Don't pass on this one just because you're a Dune purist. It was enjoyable in its own right.
3,"An okay sci-fi novel, but not Dune!","This book is fun for those who want to revisit the world of the Landsraad and Bene Gesserit, but it adds nothing new to the pre-existing universe as conceived by Frank Herbert. The plot is contrived and not one word throughout its 600 pages sent me to my dictionary; you can fault Frank Herbert for digressing, but at least he had a rich vocabulary. If you haven't read any Dune novels yet, start with Frank Herbert's original masterpiece. As one would expect from a good Futurist, Herbert explores politics, ethics, history, sociology, psychology, ecology in new, and at times unsettling, ways. Alas, the tree has sprouted far from the apple seed--one of the most compelling and thought-provoking novels of the 21st century this is not. Dune: House Atreides is a true disappointment."
3,A good page turner,"I liked the book, forgoing food and family to get it done. I read the original DUNE books when I was around 12, so I don't really remember them well. I intend to reread them all soon.The only real problem I have with this one is the same problem I have had with the other Kevin J. Anderson books I have read, the constant repeating of plot information at the beginning of every chapter. The book could have been trimmed considerably because of this, so I found myself skipping just to get past the repeating."
3,A good read that pales in comparison to the original,"After reading House Atreides, I reread Frank Herbert's original novel for about the fifth time. While I enjoyed the new book and anxiously await the next installment in Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson prequel trilogy, I found it lacking when compared to the original masterpiece. House Atreides lacks the subtleties that made Dune the finest SF novel ever written. In the authors' notes at the end, Herbert and Anderson hint that they will one day write a sequel to Chapterhouse Dune, Frank Herbert's final installment in the series. I'm glad the new Dune authors have decided to try a few practice novels before attempting to extend the stories Frank Herbert wrote so well."
3,The book is a reasonable continuation of the classic series,The Dune series as written by Frank Herbert was marvellous in its depth of plot development and full blown characters. After his death I feared the end of this great series was over. Fortunately his son has collaborated with Kevin Anderson to continue the series. Is it as good as the original stories written by Frank Herbert? Definitely not. It is still a wonderful journey back in time to the days prior to the original Dune story. We get to visit again with our old friends who we read and lived with for years. I am happy to be able to experience a continuation of the story. The best news is that the authors suggest another novel will be forthcoming finishing off the series.
1,"Why, why, why was this even tried?","Frank Herbert was able to say so much more with a flick of the wrist, a nod, or an expression. I can't really describe what it was about his writing that was so...his alone, but I can say this, the writing in this flop dosen't even come close.Re-read the origionals, ignore this sham of a Dune book."
1,No...no...no!,"I did not get past the first chapter...and after having read the ""1 star"" reviews, I am glad that I stopped. The historical inaccuracies that I have read about in the other reviews is definitely worth consideration by true Dune afficionados. When I read about a ""no ship"" being encapsulated in the first book, I laughed my head off. There was certainly no reason why this technology would just ""disappear"" for, oh, say over a thousand years later...? I won't go into it any further. Read the other bad reviews; they cover the ground quite nicely.Don't buy it for the sake of another Dune story. The first six books, by the one and only true author of Dune, Frank Herbert, should have been laid to rest. Don't damage his legacy by reading the new prequels."
1,No Original,"Well, I must say that the review from that ""French guy"" was absolutely wonderful, I too felt that this book needed alot more than a boring storyline and laser fights. It's funny to see how the sci-fi fans who call themselves ""true Herbert adherents"" dismiss Francois' claim that the book has no real heart. All they can do is complain about how great the book was and it's funny to see different names when probably the same person wrote all the good reviews."
3,The first in a trilogy that is prequel to Dune,"The book is called House Atreides, but it has characters other then the Atreides. The book revolves around several different characters views. Young Leto Atreides leaves Caladan to go to Ix for a year of education. Eight year old Duncan Idaho is a Harkonnen slave, used to give new trainees practice in hunting human prey. Shaddam, the Heir to the Empire, urged by his childhood friend, plots to assassinate his father and create a synthetic spice. The Bene Gesserit work to create the child who is to be the grandmother of the Kwisatz Haderach. The Planetolgist Pardot Kyens travels to Arrakis. This book has some interesting facts and is not badly written, but nowhere near as good as Frank Herbert's masterpiece 'Dune'"
3,Decent read but doesn't even compare to the original,"It's been a while since I last read the original series, so I was reading the prequel almost as a novel by itself. I admit I did not catch most of the glaring mistakes that other people identified.On its own merits, it's a decent read. Neither of the writers obviously have the talent of Frank Herbert, but I was actually pretty engrossed for about 80% of the book. After that, it sort of disintegrated. The ending was extremely weak and some characters had sudden reversals that were just not believable (Shaddam vs. Fenring, for example).I would say read this book if you are a fan of the series, but keep your expectations low."
5,Great Book,"I found this to be a great book. I read the paperback, yeah, the paperback this site says that hasn't been published yet. Much more than what I expected to get off a Kmart Book Shelf. :-) I had never read any of the Dune book, but I definively will. I couldn't put the book down. The longest book I had read in quite a while and i finished in a few days. I gives you so many characters and they all have enough personality to get stucked in your brain. I remember almost if not all of the characters in this book. I am stuck on the series, once House Harkonnen arrives, I'm getting it. If you don't plan on reading the next one, don't read this one because you will be left wondering. It leaves a nice base for the next book in the trilogy. Totally great"
3,Nice trip down memory lane,"I enjoyed this return to the Dune universe. I greatly appreciated the younger characterizations of Dune heavies. It was a pleasure seeing the grotesque Baron Harkonnen as a young and desirable man. And I must further confess to visualizing Miguel Ferrer playing the role of Shaddam IV as his father Jose Ferrer played the elder Shaddam in David Lynch's Dune.However, the ending was a let-down, feeling more like the stepping stone for another couple of prequel episodes. Does that sound familiar? Plus, I found the repeating inner voices a bit insulting, as if the authors felt I would forget the characters' motivations from chapter to chapter. At the end of the day, though, I did enjoy returning to the Dune environment, and I would still recommend it to anyone who can place the term ""Kwisatz Haderach."""
3,OK,"Definately not the Dune that Frank Herbert imagined. While it maintained the same elements and characters of the novel, some ends didn't tie into the whole like they should have. The coherency of the novel is somewhat hard to follow. This over descriptive novel is far divorces from Frank Herbert's style of writing which emphasized that reader need only know the basic facts and no real actions, only consequences of them. This novel lacks that superlative element."
3,"Fine, but too explanatory",I enjoyed reading more details about the Dune cosmology. However the story was too easy to read and explained everything outright. It lacks the subtle undertones of Frank's writings where you learn new things upon each re-reading.
3,A Pale Substitute,"If you wish to be mildly entertained with Duneish possibilities, read it. Don't be looking for dynamic tension or layered plots, though. Worth reading, but a pale substitute for Dune as written by Frank Herbert. Think of it as an Alternate Universe book. That will help with the more bizarre stuff. Worth your attention, but only as ancillary to Dune, not as a *true* part."
1,Just bad writing,"While it was great to have a chance to visit the Dune universe again, this was just a poor piece of writing. The only person I could reccomend this book to is someone who has read the series and is interested in learning more of the background to the story. One gets the impression that Dune was written as literature and that House Atreides was written to be a best seller appealing to the lowest common denominator. Unfortunate."
4,Good enough!,I've read all of the original Dune series several times. The first prequel is not written the same way as the originals (don't expect it to be because it was written by different authors) but it gave me enough information and background about the different characters of the series. I found it quite as interesting and exciting as the other series. You need to get through the frist chapter to really get in the book.
2,This ain't a Dune book,"I pick this book up when I'm not in the mood for my main reads. I am convinced that Brian has watched the movie a few times and may have read his fathers works but, it's hard to say. I equate this to a Star Trek/Star Wars novel. Nostalgia and boredom are all that may get me through this book. If you see it at a Garage sale....buy it!"
4,What a terribly.... enjoyable book.,"Our typically french friend's review notwithstanding, I must say, Dune : House Atreides was thoroughly enjoyable.I prefer to view this book as a primer, or rosetta stone of sorts, for the Dune series by Frank Herbert. It gives the reader the 'keys' to the future of the series, and gave some background on topics left hanging by the later books.Unlike other reviewers, I didn't expect another epic on the scale of ""War & Peace"", merely a good story.And I got it.I sincerely hope Brian does as well with the next Dune novel, it will be on my purchase list.(Don't forget to read Moby Dick as well, I hear Oprah gave it 3 stars!)"
3,a pretty good read,"I enjoyed this book overall. I don't think it was as good as the original Dune. The writing was weak in places. Also it was too violent for my taste. But overall it gave interesting background to the Dune universe, and was original enough to keep my interest. If you like the other Dune books, this is worth a try."
1,Massively Disappointing,"The original Dune series is one of my favorite works of fiction, but ""House Atreides"" does the original an immense disservice by association.""Dune: House Atreides"" is a poorly-written, badly-constructed, and barely-readable effort. The characters aren't true to the original series, the technology is weak and contradictory, and the plot could be described in two pages. Also, I'm not sure the authors know the meanings of the words ""akimbo"" or ""penultimate"".If you're a Dune fan, re-read the originals instead of wasting your time with this... book."
4,Extreme opinions,"I reviewed the ratings given this book. There are lots of 4 and 5's and lots of 1's. So apparently you love it or you hate it.I am in the former camp. It was wonderful after all these years to be able to return to Dune. True, there are some differences in style, but the book far exceeded my expectations. It is clear that much of the elaboration of the young Duke's tribulations following in his father's footsteps are the author's comments about his own situation. I believe he admirably passes his trial. I look forward to reading the next Dune books"
4,I really liked this book,"House Atreides is a good continuation of the Dune series.Speaking as a big fan of the Frank Herbert series we should all admit that sometimes he could get a little wordy.House Atreides is an easier read while still staying true to the story line.I would reccomend this book to anyone,not just Dune fans."
3,Anderson is no Herbert,"But can we expect him to be? Herbert had such a vision of the Dune universe I'm sure he could have easily written 30 more books if it weren't for his untimely death. Anderson attempts the ""prequel"" to the Dune saga, and does a relatively good job of writing in the characters. Unfortunately, the events seem to unfold in a predictable fashion as opposed to Herbert's constant surprise of what's coming next. Much of the political jockeying is also more transparent than in the original series. My roommate and I could often expound for hours with beer and copies of ""Dune"" in our hands, but this prequel does not inspire such imagination. It's a fun read, but far from the classic status Herbert acheived with Dune."
2,"Entertaining, but&#65533;","...lacking in the details. This is obviously not by the same author who wrote Dune. Details show a different concept of the Dune universe. The Bene Gesserit seem ludicrously unobservant (using a mechanical incubator with ""monitor lights"" in their birthing chamber - something a BG acolyte could do much better). ""Foldspace"" seems to be a place that takes time to cross - more like StarTrek than F.Herbert. The Tleilaxu talk about religion all the time (it isn't the secret of the Dune novels). Thufir Hawat scratches his leg while his hands are clasped behind him (three hands, Thufir?). And this quote of Leto: 'His voice filled the room. ""Father, you left large shoes for me to fill.""' - (large voice and large shoes, is he a clown?). Many details of the novels WERE included, but the flaws are obvious and detract from the quality of the story."
5,"A great, fun book.","No this is not Frank Herbert's Dune. That book was one of the greatest SF books of the century--nothing could compare.Judging this book on its own merits, I loved it! It gave me glimpses into the pasts of characters that intrigued me in Dune. I think the authors did a great job of bringing these historical figures to life. I think this is a very brave and skilled attempt to flesh out the history behind Dune and give us a galaxy-spanning tale of intrigue and adventure while doing it. Read this book and its sequels for FUN. Don't expect deep philosophical discussions, just expect to be entertained."
4,mrcalm,"The book was a good introduction to the Dune series. Explanations for characters that Frank Herbet couldn't provide adequately in Dune were given. I enjoyed reading about Barron Harkonnen's demise while sexually assaulting his Bene Gesserite breeding partner. The Ix story was good but one of the characters was left stranded, we are to assume that the evil Bene Txeileau did away with him. The Fenrig and Shaddam story provided some useful insite into the story that was never fully pursued by Herbert's father in the original. Overall I liked the story but felt the ending was a tad weak. I look forward to reading the next book in the prequel series.- Mr. Calm"
4,Surfing on the Dunes,"I really enjoyed House Atreides -- more than Chapterhouse Dune -- so I don't think the series will suffer in these hands. I did have one problem with the book: the Harkonnen no-field ship attack reeked of Star Trek: The Undiscovered Country. Not to mention that due to the length of time for a fold space trip (supposedly instantly) there wouldn't have been time for the string of events that occured to happen. Other events were predictable, but that didn't detract from my overall enjoyment."
1,Nice cream. Really poor package,I got this cream. Worked great nice lather. The cap cover was broken right out the box so I could not screw it back on. The cream itself was great as reviewed. I only got a few uses out of it as it started drying out. You would think the product would have better packaging for what the company makes itself out to be. Bottom line get the tub not the travel tube.
5,Highly informative and readable,"This book provides a great framework for analyzing and determining the why, what, how and where of offshoring. If your organization is considering a shift towards offshoring, then you should find this book very useful in helping you think through the business case. The book does not drown you in details, but still provides a comprehensive overview of the offshoring industry."
1,Empty book with very little useful information,"I bought this book assuming that i could get some sort of inside information about engineering programs in Canada. Upon flipping through the pages I found that most of the information was vague and easy to find anywhere on the internet. Furthermore, the 3 universities I am most interested in: UBC, Waterloo, amd University of Toronto (among the top engineering schools in Canada) were not even included in this book."
3,not too heavy,"Single mom needed to reach 12 ft ceilings and carry upstairs. This one wasn't too heavy for me. Wanted the Little Giant style but they were all super heavy. This works, but doesn't feel all that sturdy. [...]"
2,Not so living foods,"I found that most of the recipes in this book were either mildly ""gross"", in lack of better words, or they need some work to be better organized. I suppose this book could be considered a semi-introduction to living foods. However, I bought this book in combination with the rainbow green live food cuisine book and found the latter not only tastier and healthy but also easier. I recommend that book if you're looking for a well rounded introduction and eventual follow through to raw food. By the way, I don't recomend her fruit sorbet for those with glycemic difficulties, may induce sugar over load."
3,"Cheap ""Animal House"" knockoff with topless Priscilla Barnes","Priscilla Barnes was the second replacement on ""Three's Company"" for Suzanne Somers in an ""Animal House"" wannabe movie. The plot is typical. It's raunchy humor. Alan Reed, who was the voice of Fred Flintstone, also appears in the movie, and I actually felt badly for him for doing it. I am assuming that he did it for the money. He played a professor, who is being seduced by Priscilla. She stands topless in the doorway to which Alan Reed replies, ""You'll get a cold in da boobies!"" Priscilla flashing her boobs was the best part."
1,122 PAGES--THAT'S IT!!!,"THAT'S HOW FAR I MADE IT---122 PAGES---COULD NOT TAKE ANY MORE.?? IS THIS A SCRIPT FOR A """"LIFETIME"""" MOVIE DRAMA ??CHECK MY TRACK RECORD---I DON'T MIND READING SOME CHRISTIAN FICTION.BUT---THIS WAS PRETTY SAPPY.IF YOU WANT TO READ SOME DECENT CHRISTION FICTION--""""MONSTER""""---""""THE OATH""""------""""THE VISITATION""""---ALL BY FRANK PERETTI----INTERESTING STORIES WITH A MESSAGE."
2,oceans apart,The book took more than twice as long to get to me than other books I ordered at the same time and it was not in as nice condition as the others.
4,"Predictable, but good.","Every twist to this book was predictable, but the story itself was very well written. The words brought out every emotion in me. Seeing how the wife processed and worked through her own insecurities was insiteful."
5,better than expected,"This was this best book I have ever read. I think these books are great for anyone at any age. I am 20 and I love them. My mom read this side of heaven so while shopping for a new book to read I chose ocean's apart recognizing the author. This book made me cry. It tells of the hard times many couples face, and how you can let God drift during the hard times. I loved how Max, and Connor and Michelle had a happy ending. I would recommend this book to everyone, it is moving!"
2,Unlikeable Story and Characters,"While it was certainly pulled at the heartstrings and was enjoyable in parts, overall the tone of the book turned me off. The little boy character was like a symbol - too perfect - not like a real child at all. The wife character was unlikeable and unforgiving for 99% of the story. The story's treatment of the orphaned boy character, about how he was just some terrible mistake, and the fact that the characters even considered sending him away, unacknowledged, was a little repellent to me."
3,"Predictable, Fluffy, Fun","Yes this book is predictable, and yes it's fluffy, but if that is what you're after, this is an enjoyable read."
5,This book will make you think,This book is outstanding! Kingsbury does an excellent job of capturing real human emotions. She is not afraid to create flawed characters with real emotions who are dealing with a heart wrenching situation. It was very easy to relate to the characters and to feel what they were feeling. Many Christian authors stick with fluffy topics and create too perfect characters. I commend Kingsbury for tackling difficult topics and for creating a story that will hook readers and make them think. This book will not disappoint.
4,Emotional Read,"This is my first Karen Kingsbury novel. The tragedy is borderline unbearable. This book has a nice ending, and takes you through the struggle of infidelity, but the emotion is so raw, and the characters, especially that of the little boy, were a little too unbelieveable. I don't know if I'd be willing to give this author another shot or not, and I am an avid reader of Christian fiction. Should've gotten it from the library.Aimee"
4,Good but not her best,Ocean's apart while well worth reading left me not loving the story or feeling the raw emotions of most of Karen Kingsbury's books. Conner and Michele Evans have the perfect marriage and the perfect daughters but what causes Connor to have the affair and the whole affair just does't seem real to me. The only parts of the book I loved were the parts with Max the son that Connor fathered. I loved the little boy and could not understand how Michelle could not fall in love with that little boy. This is an easy read just not up to par with some of her other work.
5,Oceans apart,"This was avery heart warming story,I cried though a lot of it for the little boys heartache and his love for his dog,the best book I have read in a long time,"
1,Fairy tale that does injustice to adultery,"This book was unrealistic. The adultery portrayed in this book was exposed, forgiven and then given a happy ending in what seemed like weeks. Poor story line."
2,Too perfect,"I usually like Karen Kingsbury books but this was just too much. The characters were so unreal. The seven year old boy was perfect. Totally unlike a normal seven year old especially going through the loss of his mother.The book was way too mushy for my taste. It was also too predictable. An affair in a marriage is devastating. Not something that can be fixed in a few weeks.The other thing that really bothered me what the way she wrote when the boy was talking. I really didn't like the little kid talk she wrote in. Everything was ""my mommy""... or some mispronounced word. It was kind of like reading Junie B Jones.I did not like this book."
2,Cheesy and predictable,"There is so much foreshadowing in this book you'll know how it ends if within the first few chapters. This book posses no twist or turns. The characters are one-dimensional, the dialogue is cheesy, and the book is filled with preachy undertones. I suppose I should have done more research before purchasing the book, and I would have known better, but I was expecting more ""literature"" but found it to be ""chick-lit"".I won't be purcahsing any more Kingsbury's novels.On a positive note, it is a quick-read."
5,Pilot's Wife Unsure,"As the wife of an airline pilot, I was a little unsure if I wanted to read this book. Just like I don't care to read books about airplane crashes. But I began reading and couldn't stop. Although the pilot's affair isn't justified, you can see where the marriage had trouble.The book reinforces the fact that a woman needs to pay attention to her husband. A woman who treats her husband with the respect she gave him while they were dating should never fear him wandering.If I was the wife of the Connor, I would like to think I would have forgiven him. With God all things are possible.This is a terrific book about marriage, forgiveness, and returning to God."
5,Absolutely Freakin' Stunning,"This is one of the greatest jazz album sets of all time. What you have here is some great standards sung wonderfully sung by Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald, many as duets, with Louis blasting out some great trumpet solos, and the peerless Oscar Peterson trio providing the backing.Louis and Ella were recorded a lot together and clearly they enjoyed working together. This comes through in every song.Louis Armstrong practically invented the jazz solo and jazz singing as well, after his lip split and put some limits on his trumpet playing. Here you have one of the greatest American figures of the twentieth century on absolute top form, as is Ella.This is absolutely essential listening. It will probably make you cry, but afterward you will feel better.My highest recommendation."
5,Louis Armstrong/Ella Fitzgerald.,Great sounds of classical jazz with 2 superb and unique vocalists. Enough mix of vocals and horn playing to show both sides of Louie.
3,review of Los de Abajo,"This story about the Mexican Revolution is written in a very creative Spanish style. The theme is centered around the fights of the Revolutionaries as they travel throughout Mexico. It is very bloody, grusome, and brutal, but apparentaly very true to history in that sense. It is medium to advanced Spanish level reading but a very good piece of literature."
5,Two of the Greats!!,"Carmen McRae & Betty Carter deliver a great live set of jazz and fun, both ladies giving each other room to shine and both singing together as a duet should be done! not trying to out do each other! i would have loved for them to have recorded more duet lp's, but i'm so glad they gave us this wonderful cd!!!"
3,good chase scene,"For those fearful of buying a Platinum Disk, this one is actually uncensored. It's standard definition, so a bit blurry by DVD standards, but a decent print. The film is what it is, a soft-core sex film with pretensions of being a psychological drama, or maybe vice versa. Worth it for the charming and lovely Chase Masterson (Leeta on Deep Space 9)."
4,The Curse of the Monkey's Paw,"The Monkey's Paw is an entertaining story especially for those who like shudder, suspense, drama and the supernatural. The way the story builds up is interesting, and the first of the three wishes is not made until the middle of the story. The wish is for 200 gold coins, but the wishers find out that they pay an enormous price for their wish, thanks to the curse of the monkey's paw."
5,Works as expected,Sensor looks identical to the factory model and solved the inability to start after short trips and the random stalling at stop lights.Good price for a good sensor!
3,For Audie Murphy fans,This one is for Audie Murphy fans. Not one of his best movies. And he made some really good ones. If you are simply a western fan consider the price and don't expect too much.
5,This book should take more than 5 stars!!! Great One!!!,"A very nice story....with very nice true realities! Things that happen to our lives ...answers to our questions.....strong characters.....strong beliefs.... This book should be at the Schools as lesson....to let the childrens know a part of the reality of this world!!!! Thank you for reading it!!! Thank you because I think by reading it....you put a brick to the building that is called ""Peaceful World""!"
4,Still a great book after many years,"I read this about 25 years ago and list it as one of those books that really influenced my outlook on life. I'm just finishing it up again and still love it, as it has those gentle reminders we all need for the bigger picture and some very enjoyable plot twists and scenes.I am absolutely shocked, however, by the number of typos, especially for a book this well-known. There are several dozen typos in the Kindle version. Needs a Kindle edit."
4,Life changing,"I read the ""Peaceful Warrior"" many years ago. It lead me on a journey . Now 10 years later I continue but with much peach and understanding. I was in a supermarket drinking coffee and this young man and i out of the blue started talking about his mentor whom his miss so much. He brought up the Peaceful Warrior and said he tried to find it. I replied I know how to get it on Amazon. Shortly after I ordered it and gave it to him. His reply was I will start reading this to night. I know he has regained his journey thanks to the ""Peaceful Warrior"""
4,A spiritual motivation book,"I read this book because it was recommended by the person who has been guiding me on my own personal spiritual journey. I guess I have reached a point in my developement where these lessons are no longer that relevant to me (or perhaps I am not avanced enough to appreciate the teachings). I would not recomend this book to my students. I consider this more a book to motivate one to begin one's own spiritual search than a book that has any actual answers and I would not recommend it to someone that who is already advancing on the path of becoming a humble servant to the God (aka the Univese, the Source)."
2,Surprising how this book fails to grab your attention.,"The title of this book aroused my curiosity; however, after 3 or 4 reading sessions, I found it easy to just let the book rest and pick up something else to read. I suppose I was looking for a ""how-to"" book, but instead found it to be tiresome fiction."
5,The BEST spirituality/self-help/fiction book I have ever read!!!!,"This book is amazing. If you live in a human body, this book can help you. When I started reading this book I found myself looking deep into my soul and feeling awful because a lot of the challenges that Dan went through when he was in college are happening to me in my life right now. If you've seen the movie, ""Peaceful Warrior"", I would definitely suggest to you that you read this book because it will change your life.My final words are...Are you 100% happy and satisfied with EVERY aspect of your life? Are you living a perfect/horrible/ or ""so-so"" human life right now?? If you answered ""YES"" to ANY of the questions, the very least that you can do for me and your family is to at least put this book on your ""wish-list"" or recommend it to a friend and ask how they like it because you never have time to read."
1,Suitable for children or the intellectually challenged.,"This is a reasonable fairy tale which can help to pass the time while on the train. However it is very simplistic and not at all inspiring since it's nothing you haven't heard a million times before. The 'insight' into life is given through a mystical, supernatural old hippie called socrates - this makes the story far too abstract and cannot be applied to real life. Dan Millman has made a lot of money out of some very gullible people. If you want to know about the meaning of life etc then go to the experts and read the views of a real philosopher. Hey..what about Socrates. Or else, try 'Sophie's World' by Josteein Gaardner, which is a far more insightful and intelligent read."
2,Just don't understand the hype,"I first read this book about ten years ago, and while I thought it was an interesting story, failed to see the point in it. I reread it recently, thinking that now since I had become more ""enlightened"" maybe I had missed something. I liked it even less than previously. If you're looking for a book that ""changes lives"" skip this one."
3,not for me,It was a gift for my mom and she loved it. It's a product that you can't find in Mexico so it's excellent to have Amazon that could bringh it for us LOVE YOU
4,"Hello, I am stupid, but this book is not","People may say that this book has no storyline or plot, but they are right. I don't care. I know people don't like to read nonsense books, but sometimes they offer a powerful message. This book makes you think about what really matters in life, and helps you deal with stresses in a much more relaxing way."
4,a great read ........but,A great story indeed but so many grammatical errors left a bad taste in my mouth.....I will be complaining to Amazon at 10 dollars and dozens of errors some compensation is in order.....shame on you Amazon
3,Interesting book...?,"This is an interesting book, but not one I would say that is so immensely profound, as the cover suggests. (A book that changes lives) It made me want to be more disciplined, and to clear the mind of excesses. But I had a few problems with the story. Maybe it was written so that even a ten year old could understand it. I had trouble with the fact that this man had no real, long,intimate relationships with anyone other than Socrates. His marriage was also pushed aside, like it didn't really matter who he hurt on his path to self enlightenment. I also had trouble believing that he could become so submissive to somebody whose real name was kept secret.Does vegetarianism and drinking herbal tea really make that much of an impact? Beside those points it was a good book, I read it in two days. This probably would have been my favorite book as a teenager."
2,Too much fantasy not enough reality,"I was looking for the life lessons that I found in the way of the peaceful warrior, this was more Harry Potter meets Karate Kid."
4,Inspiring and catchy read,"Having heard it mentioned on more than one occasion that ""Way of the Peaceful Warrior"" was a life-changing story, I felt compelled to pick up a copy. I ordered one used from Amazon.com, and quickly started reading as soon as the item arrived. It didn't take long before I found myself completely enthralled in the story. The author does a good job telling a story that we can all relate to. Whether I believe that this is non-fiction is a different review in itself. However, I absolutely loved this book. As a forewarning, this story includes several Buddhist principles, and the author does not try to finesse them at all. However, the lessons provided within these pages are definitely worth while to people looking for some inspiration. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking for something different."
5,Professional Review,Hello all I am the National Book Examiner for Examiner.com here is my expert review of this book: [...] Personally I would recommend this book and the movie to anyone on the planet!
2,Falling Flat,"Beyond two or three stories lifted from other works, this book contains very little insight. If you are hoping for Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance , keep on looking. If you are looking for a quick clumsily written book about an painfully self-involved gymnast's not so dramatic change into a slightly less self-involved author, bingo."
2,Hard to get into to,So glad I rented this audio from the local library. Just could not get into the book at all.I listened to a few chapters and then returned it. The whole time hoping for some practical nuggets.I don't recommend this book for an adult.
3,Mind-opening fantasy,"This book is truly inspiring, mind-opening and will change the way you look at life forever. It shows you the great possibilities that are in store for every human being, most of which are untapped resources. In this respect I find this book extremely powerful and helpful.There is one thing, however, that I find to be disturbing. The story is based on fiction as well as fantasy. This fact wouldn't be bad by itself, however, the reader gets the impression that this book is a sincere autobiography - which it is not. Thus, while appreciating the fantastic story, we should not take the story itself for real. We may, however, learn from the lessons it contains."
2,I found this book disappointingly uninspiring,"Based on the rave reviews and recommendations of friends, my expectation were high for this book. Unfortunately, Mr. Millman's ego-infused wonder at himself reminded me of Jerry Seinfeld's self-centered smirks at his own jokes."
1,Way of the Self-absorbed warrior.,"Your life will be better if you save the money you would have spent on this book. If you like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or Barney the Purple Dinosaur, this book may be for you. Yeah, this book changed my life.........for the worse. The 6 hours of mindless, self-absorbed fantasy drivel in audio form nearly sent me looking for a hanging tree. I stuck it out to the bitter end hoping this story would just END. I didn't care if the guy got hit by a train or got VD from one of his numerous trysts or if he ever figured ANYTHING out. I guess this crap sells: I bought it.If you want to change your life forever, look elsewhere for guidance. If you want to be a divorced, self-absorbed naval gazer, this book is a good guide."
1,Another case of hype not living up to the reality,"Talk about a disappointment! I've read and heard so much about this book and from the get-go...well I had to let it go and quickly. So bad. It appears that another get-rich-scheme has come and gone, with Mr. Millman being the winner. I wouldn't pay 50 cents for this book, I'm glad I didn't add to the profits by actually buying this. The library had a copy available. save your money. This is a work of fiction and a bad one at that. Not some life-changing read that you can't live without. Soooo bad!"
4,Nice Book,"Intellectual book but weak writing still as well as integrated story. But it provokes thinking and gives tips on how to improve habits (eating, sports, dealing with life and so on)"
5,"I am asking a book, in fact, I am beging...","Well, I am 23 and I live in a small and distant city in Brazil and I am writing it because I'd like to read the book Way Of The Peaceful Warrior.I read the costomer comments about it and I am sure I need it!I don't have money to buy it and I don't know nobody in Brazil that could you borrow me it.But, if you send me or give me this book I'll be very grateful forever! I know english - a dutch priest taught me it - so reading in English isn't problem to me.I must go now because my time is up! I hope hear from somebody as soon as possible.I don't know if I'm doing the right way but at least, I am trying it! My Adresss is Rua Marechal Floriano-444 Centro, Alagoinhas, Bahia, Brazil Cep.48100-000 Thanks, Fábio Klester"
3,way of peaceful warrior,"For entertaining reading this is a good book.For promoting MORE thinking, this book will do it.However, I wouldn't fool myself into thinking this book will change my life.The inner journey is an individual trip, not a guided tour."
2,Good but this edition is full of typos,I enjoyed this book. It is a good story about a man's spiritual journey. My only complaint is that this edition contains many typos and misplaced words.
4,Great Lessons,Love this story. A great companion to Celestine Phrophecy and others that teach the lessons of our own inner strength. Inspiring and relevant. I highly recommend.Check out my newest thriller - Bound by Birth - by Randall R WheelerBound By Birth
2,Too Many Typos,I loved the book. But the transformation from paper to kindle was horrible. Tons of typos that left me trying to figure out exactly what word was supposed to be in that place. I felt more like a copy editor at times.
2,"Entertaining, but far too sappy for my taste","While I enjoyed the book, there were aspects of it that just didn't allow it to leave the impact a lot of other people felt.I found the dialogue written far too poorly for my taste. People just do not talk like that. It was far too corny, and it really took me out of the story quite a bit, smiling at how absurd some of it was. I was also, surprisingly, turned off by the whole ""magical"" aspect of the book. Stories like this always seem to work best when you believe they could happen. With this one, I found myself openly thinking to myself (quite often), ""I'm supposed to be buying into this?""I thought it was a decent story, and I can certainly tell it is something that could be very meaningful to some people. It just didn't touch me."
3,did not receive,I had the delivery sent to a detention facility andbecause there are CD's included it was returned. I cannotgive this a rating.
2,Wipe on... wipe off,Repetitive theme since biblical times.. may be more relevant to younger generation not familiar with Karate Kid. Simple read for anyone.
3,Interesting,"At the beginning of the book it was a very good read with good life lessons. As the story goes on, it becomes harder to stay focused with the storyline. It became a little unbelievable as story goes on."
5,An awesome book for everybody,"I choose to give it a 5 stars because after finishing reading this book it helped realize something that nobody from everyday ever mentions at all which is the Way. Thanks to a professor I met in college, which he introduced me too, I was able to see something new and now I'm even more inspire to achieve a dream a long to accomplish."
3,"Good subject, bad conclusions","There are some truths about behaviour. The story type presentation does not help give it the seriousness the subject deserves. A man, endowed with superb gymnastic skill plus the achievement of an excellent school record is somehow convinced by a shaman to spend most of his life searching for ""the way"", settling for less and less and ending up in a position below his capabilities. This is not the message an already wayward youth is searching for."
4,"Not the Best, But Very Good","I don't know if this book does indeed `change lives' as it claims, but it does a good job of presenting a healthy philosophy of life. The story was a bit too `goody goody' for my taste though. I much prefer Regan's novel, `The Evolution of a Warrior'. Still, I highly recommend Millman's book as well."
5,Millman Changes Lives,"Let me start by saying that I was very skeptical of this particular book when it was recomended to me by my brother. You see so many of these self improvement books written by some no name author that wants to make a quick buck. This book, however, is written so well and has such a great story that it keeps you interested and teaches a lesson at the same time. It says on the cover, ""a book that changes lives"" and thats exactly what this book can do. It is captivating, it sends you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions and laughter which can last a life time with in your heart. To this day i still live by and am conscious of the lessons Mr. Millman taught in his master piece of a book. Strongly recomended."
5,We're all ready,If you choose to read this book then it is the right time for you to start the change. To be given insights into how we can better our lives is a very special thing. And must be given in the right way and at the right time. It can be a story about any one of us. And how our lives can get better from having a conscious understanding of how things really work in this world. It was given to me by a friend at the right time and I am thankful.
4,Great book with lots of truth in it,"Excellent book, with a lot of truths in it as well.I don't know if I believe in Socrates, but truth is truth and many of the lessons in this book are true.Reminds of the the book Illusions by Richard Bach, I like that one more, not as heavy handed as this one, but both can lead to a better understanding of life, and how to live ours to the fullest."
5,Renewing,The Peaceful Warrior is a meaning reminder of the importance of living a good life and following your heart.
3,helpful,"I heard so much about this book that I was determined to read it. I struggle with my surroundings and needall the help that I can get to help me accept thethings that I cannot change. This book gave me a wholenew perspective on my experiences and personal difficulties. I am grateful for the chance to have read it and grateful for the perspectives that I gleaned from having a glimpse of Dan's journey.Thanks,Cheryl T."
4,loved it!,I love eastern philosophy and religion. I read alot back in my college days. Much of this story is exactly that in a westernized style. Kind of refreshed my reading. I will give this to my son who is 10 in a few years.
2,Good Message but Poorly Delivered,"It was hard for me to get through this book although I understood many of its themes. I think that the author failed in trying to write a ""novel"" out of his personal spiritual experience. I was hoping that there would be more of a deeper philosophical discussion behind his narration but rather I found the reading rather dry and unengaging. Maybe the simplicity of the book is deliberate, as ""Socrates"" would have prefered. But for a book that ""changes lives,"" I expected that there would be more of a discussion of the journey of the spirit."
2,Great book... for a teenager,"PRO: A good book for someone who is under 21 years old. It's simple, straightforward with some basic wisdom.CONS:- Poor, infantile writing. Full of cliches. Predictable.- It's a shame that the author didn't write in the 3rd person. It would have been more effective, like Og Mandino's outstanding books. I had the same problem with ""The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari."" It's another book like this one. The author pretends he's the impulsive idiot and he meets some wise guy. It's a fine concept, but it's poorly executed here, just like in the ""Monk"" book.- This is fiction, although he tries to make it sound real, and I'm sure many of these things did indeed happen, but any make believe is fiction). Fiction should sound believable; this doesn't.CONCLUSION: This is a cheesy book. Teenagers probably won't notice. Those seeking great wisdom, look elsewhere. I recommend ""The Greatest Salesman in the World"" instead."
4,Way of the Peaceful Warrior: A Book that Changes Lives,The book makes you do alot of thinking about life. It was very good and definately had my attention thru out. I will buy the sequel to this book.
4,Common sense plus more!,"The way of the peaceful Warrior is a very good book. it has much practical wisdom for everyday living. Some of it is simply common sense with a sprinkling of fun and a vivid imagination. Some of it gets a little, ""woo""woo"".For exaple the main character is frequently called ""jackass"" by his mentor and on one occasion as this is happening, Dan looks into the mirror and sees himself with ears like a donkey accented with a bright yellow ribbon!Even with the odd-ball parts I would still reccommend it highly."
3,Entertaining book just don't live by it!,"Interesting read filled with self-actualization and revelation some truth and some fantasy. The author made some good points about improving oneself and being a master of oneself, however, he injected the storyline with a lot of fiction. Some are realistic and most of the time believable. Nonetheless, it was entertaining and worth reading but don't change your life over night just to live by it. Plus, the movie didn't do the book justice. Way off from the storyline in the book."
3,Way of the Peaceful Warrior...,"I liked the thought provoking element of this book. It seems to me that the author is trying to compel the reader to think through his or her own life and to come to certain spiritual conclusions. The book is a narrative of the life of Dan Millman and is done well. There are times that I got lost with what the author was trying to convey but overall, I will rate this book as a good read if one wants to think through their own life's journey and how they have dealt with it."
3,interesting meld of fact and fiction,"The book is a good read and has good life lessons entwined in an entertaining story. Although I believe the protagonist was selfish throughout the story, the idea of better living, feeling and thinking came through."
3,Mind-opening fantasy,"This book is truly inspiring, mind-opening and will change the way you look at life forever. It shows you the great possibilities that are in store for every human being. In this respect I find this book extremely powerful and helpful.There is one thing, however, that I find to be disturbing. The story is based on fiction as well as fantasy. This fact wouldn't be bad by itself, however, the reader gets the impression that this book is a sincere autobiography - which it is not. Thus, while appreciating the fantastic story, we should not take the story itself for real. We may, however, learn from the lessons it contains."
1,"Average Book that cannot really ""change lives""","Reading the book word to word and then reviewing the promotional website, the authors confesses that none of the events in the book actually happened except the normal life events of going to college,mating,marrying,working etc. The book can be interesting at times but the mixing of philosophy, spirtituality and author's own life is ridiculous. The thoughts presented by the author have been clearly borrowed from Eastern culture and you see a ""cocktail"" version. Yet the world is full of different people and someone or the other will purchase this book and make their own judgements. To conclude, the book is fake concotion and not nearly original. The author tries to be a spirtual leader but fails."
1,Read a real author like Nathaniel Branden.,"This is the worst book I could send to someone if I wanted them to ""change their life"". I read this because an ex-girlfriend recommended it to me and it is truly awful. There is no real story, there is no real plot, its an empty book that is a total waste of time, extolling the virtues of altruism and mysticism.As a matter of fact, if you truly want to read a book that will change your life without being so lame I suggest anything by Alexandre Dumas, Ayn Rand or Nathaniel Branden.Wait a minute! This book did in fact change my life! It changed it because it got me to realize that if a woman you're seeing ever reccomends a piece of trash like this book to you, that you should run away as fast as your feet can carry you!"
2,Mildly Entertaining,"I don't want to repeat other criticisms of this book, but only to add an additional perspective. I find it hard to fathom how a young man who went to UC Berkeley in the '60's can assert that he attained a high level of awareness during and slightly after that period without once mentioning, or showing he had any consciousness of, the great social forces and events that were occuring in that period: the Vietnam War and the anti-war movement, the Civil Rights Movement, the Women's Movement, Gay Liberation, the Free Speech Movement (at Berkeley itself), the Black Panthers, the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.--the list goes on and on."
5,his book withholds the SECRETS of life,I have a hard time beliving that one book can contain so much divine knowledge.
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"A real lightweight. It read like a Disney story or a remake of the Karate Kid. Sorry, but it had very little to offer other than a nice story in which to make a movie."
2,Poorly written,I couldn't get through it. The writing is on a 4th grade level and the stories about this Socrates character are mystical in a very juvenile way.
1,Fome,"Es un Cd fome, no vele la pena comprarlo. esta hecho a base de sintetizadotes. Cuando lo compré pesaba que se trataba de un disco que contenía voces entonando el OM, pero no es de esa forma. No aconsejo comprarlo."
5,Gritty,"I know, maybe we are used to seeing ""Robert Taylor"" in a certian setting when it come to movies, but this one has a good story behind it and a good cast of women coming out of the norm to reach cross country to their awaited future husbands and home, but it's what goes on on the way to their destination that makes it real good.By the time they get there, the husbands should be wearing the aprons. GET THIS ONE."
3,"Convoi de femmes ""listed as widescreen but is full screen""","Just to let others know this pal region 2 dvd release of Westward the Women (Convoi de femmes) is listed as (2.35:1) widescreen but is in fact 1.37:1 full screen The picture quality of the DVD is very good, the mono English soundtrack quality is a little low, all and all a good bare bones release of this classic western"
5,One great movie!!,"This one is one of my favorites! A great cast of characters and a wonderful story. It is at times so funny and at others just heartbreaking and it has one of the greatest endings of any movie I have seen! By the time these women make it to California they are tough, independent and nobody to be messed with!! It's one of the best westerns I have ever seen and a great tribute to the women who made that incredible journey in the 1800's!"
3,OK,"Way back in the late sixties, my dad would sit up and watch the late show and smoke cigarettes after his parents went to bed. And he remembers this movie! He says he thinks it's good and I should see it."
1,disappointed!,"Purchased a Mother's Day Gift wanted to exchange the video because it couldn't be viewed. Found out after I made the purchase that it only plays in region 2. I did not know what region 2 met, I asked for an exchange, I was turned down and told to go and purchase a dvd player that plays both regions 1 and 2. I was disappointed and took the loss. I will not purchase anything from that sight or individual ever again."
4,Great movie - even if you aren't Gloria Steinham,"As a fan of the more ""rough-and-tumbleweed"" John Wayne and Clint Eastwood westerns, I am almost embarressed to admit that I really like this movie with wall-to-wall women. Most of the reviewers here have focused on the feminist empowerment aspects of this movie, but actually it is an enjoyable film even if your idea of a strong woman is a wife that takes out the trash. (Coincidentally, one of the actresses resembles Bella Abzug.) With a strong story, interesting visuals and enough ""women-in-distress"" scenes to keep any man interested, this admittedly unusual movie should not be pidgeon-holed as a niche market film."
1,Westward The Women,"This is such a great classic western. I give it a one, because it is not available in US DVD format. Please when will this movie be on DVD for the USA?"
3,"Women's "" liberation "" into men's clothes","Robert Taylor's advice addressing the group of 100 future brides is to dress in men's clothes as he tugs on his own pants as a demonstration model. About 2/3 of the women are dressed in "" drag "" as cowboys while the other 1/3 keep their feminine garb on the wagon train."
5,SPLENDID WESTERN!,"This is a rousing story starring that handsome but in this movie, unshaven and grizzled Robert Taylor leading a group of resilient pioneer women heading west to meet their future husbands for the first time. The plot moves along briskly. The great director William Wellman shows real flair for staging exciting action sequences. He handles a large cast of actors, horses, cattle, wagon trains, and even a cute little dog with great ease and skill.""Westward the Women"" contains some wonderful comic moments along with occasional tragedies and much hardship along the westward trail. The movie makes you appreciate how brave and industrious these pioneers had to be to endure the harsh weather and terrain along with occasional Indian attacks and frequent lack of provisions.Watching ""Westward the Women"" will give you the audience a very pleasant two hours of entertainment and enlightenment about America's westward expansion."
4,Women Out West,"Robert Taylor stars as the tough head of a wagon train of women heading West to California to marry men in need of female companionship at a new settlement. The women are an odd assortment who prove their mettle in the face of floods, Indians, and various other obstacles. It's an unusual premise, but director William Wellman and the story's creator Frank Capra make it memorable, along with capable performances by all the cast, especially Hope Emerson as the no-nonsence Patience. You've got to have respect for the women and all that they faced and conquered. The West needed a lot of strong women to help build it, and this film gives them credit."
4,werner ladder,"I knew this was the ladder I wanted. Could have bought it locally, but didn't have to pay for shipping or sales tax with Amazon. When the first ladder arrived, it was damaged and totally unusable. I refused the shipment and notified Amazon. The shipment refusal was verified and Amazon immediately had another ladder on its way to me. Second ladder was actually packaged better than the first one and arrived with no damage. I have had nothing but positive experiences buying from Amazon and will continue to buy from them. Can't beat the tax exemptions and their free shipping is awesome!"
5,The Best Oscar Peterson Album !!!!!!!,"Incredible Playing, Get this albumThis is by Far the Best Ive heard OP play with amazing tunes and arragements.Get this album you wont regret itUPDATE FEB 2009:i CANT GET OVER THIS ALBUM AND IT HAS BEEN ALMOST A YEARI dont now what got into OP & Trio If Jimmy Hendrix was a Jazz pianist MAYBE THIS IS WHAT WOULD HAVE COME OUTINCREDIBLE INCREDIBLE INCREDIBLE INCREDIBLE INCREDIBLEThank You Oscar !!!!"
4,Superb Jazz,"This C.D. contains some great music. The mix of familiar and new music is balanced. Oscar's piano ability is outstanding as well as the other musicians. Pardon the phrase, but it is a must have."
1,WORST dog stories ever told,"Don't buy this book. You can get it out of my garbage. There are a few stories worth reading. The rest are boring, some barely pertaining to dogs. One even describes a puppy being mutilated as the mother dog watches.More aptly titled WORST dogs stories ever told."
5,"Best of the ""Lite"" Cheeses","I've tried most if not all of the ""lite"" cheddars on the market and Cabot's beats them all. Its texture is closer to that of full-fat cheddar by far; none of that rubbery feel here. The flavor is distinctly cheddar, not as sharp as the best full-fat extra sharp cheddars, but it definitely has a presence and stands up to mustard (other lite cheddars tend to taste like American cheese). We use this for nachos, cheese omelets, and grilled cheese sandwiches. It melts with grace. It is good to eat straight, as I've learned when I get it out to shred--people show up and carve off slices, never complaining that it is ""lite."" I do recommend sharing the 10-pound loaf with friends if you have a small household--after a month or so, an opened package, even one that has been carefully wrapped, may suffer some mold."
3,"Great speaker wire connector, if they worked with all kinds of wire.","The basic idea of these connectors is great, but the screw provided with each connector is way too short for most wires, so, unless you are using a really thick wire, they will not tighten , thus making poor contact. I tried them on two surround systems, and it would not tighten even with the thicker wire, I was suggested to bend over the cable to make it double but I had tried that already and it did not work."
2,Not for me,Tired with an older Bose speaker system & could not make it work. Tiny tiny screws are very tough to deal with. If they hit the floor they are very hard to find. Not for me.Would not buy again. No knock on the seller...just not a great product.
5,begs for repeated listens,"""A thoroughly charming debut that begs for repeated listens... From plinking piano lines on a Rhodes to the folksy tones of a fiddle, fuzzed-out guitar to jazz-inflected upright bass, her lo-fi compositions are rich with texture and rife with catchy melodies... A dulcet voice, pure in pitch and beautifully earnest... a deep intelligence and a fierce wit."""
5,Honoo no Blaze!! ^^,"I loved this conclusion to what I do believe (if I remember correctly) was the first season of ""Mirage of Blaze"". The show IS based on a yaoi manga, so hopefully, the next thirteen episodes will develop more on the confused love between Takaya and Naoe. I think that there were twenty-six episodes in all.The artwork was amazing, as were the voice actors (if anyone took notice, Naoe's voice actor, Hayami Shou, played Muraki in ""Yami no Matsuei"", as did Takaya's seiyuu, Seki Toshihiko (Watari-sensei). HOWEVER, I recommend you stick with the Japanese language... the english voice actors SUCKED. ::shudders::But, for the shounen-ai/yaoi fan, Mirage of Blaze (Honoo no Blaze) is a great show... it moves a bit fast, and a new character is introduced almost every episode and is not given closure (hopefully, this means they'll be releasing the next thirteen episodes), but the story is solid and the characterizations are portrayed well.Highly Recommended!!-- R.C."
2,Generic and silly.,"Spiderhole (Daniel Simpson, 2010)Generic torture-porn dreck that I can't even say really tries for anything interesting. Four art-school chums (The Hole's Emma Griffiths Malin, The Illusionist's Reuben-Henry Briggs, and two newcomers, George Maguire and Amy Noble), presumably to save money on dorm fees, decide to spend a semester as squatters in an abandoned building. All well and good, unless someone--or something--is already there when you show up... the movie makes an attempt to build suspense as to who or what is offing our unrelatable, unlikable foursome, but it fails pretty miserably; there are no hooks here that will make you care one way or the other. When you can't identify with anyone in a movie because the script is doing its best to make you despise everyone in it, something went seriously wrong somewhere along the way. *"
5,Another great adventure for Riley!,"This is a great next stop for Riley (following the previous book, Tigers in Terai). My daughters (ages 7 and 3) loved the book and read it again and again. It's a fabulous book to donate to your school library or child's classroom (at our school, second graders focus on endangered species, so it's perfect for her class). I highly recommend it for a gift, too, for boys or girls, ages 3-10. The illustrations are fabulous and colorful, the photos are fantastic, and the kids will learn something new every time they read it. Where will Riley go next?"
1,Marketing-minded authors,"The concept of this book is wonderful... interviews with glbt people who talk about their coming out experiences in a religious setting. This book is a piece of marketing propaganda for the United Church of Christ. Nearly every person mentions how wonderful and magical the UCC is. Personally, denomination should have been left out of it."
1,Poor function - Good looks!,I bought this bellow online because I liked the flowing shape and reasonable price. Within 3 weeks of using it the leather cracked in several places around the tip and sides. It now leaks so much that it focuses very little air out of the tip and into the wood stove.
3,cosi cosi,She advocates much too much makeup application. I don't think we all need foundation plus prep plus concealer plus this plus that plus.... Also she advocates natural beauty (accept your humped nose! etc...) but her models all have the typical symmetrical look. Which is fine and dandy but mildly hypocritical considering her natural beauty advocacy. I do like the section for teenage girls about self acceptance. Still overall her product line and approach just isn't my thing.
2,Too many rules,"Too many times bobbi will say something like ""what you don't want""... or ""you don't want this""... etc. How does she know what I do or don't want? There are lots of different looks. Bobbi likes certain looks, and presents them here. But remember the title of the book is BOBBI BROWN BEAUTY. the book is Bobbi's style. Bobbi's opinion. If she really believes there's beauty everywhere, why does she highlight Brooke Shields as the perfect beauty? How is there a perfect beauty on one hand and on the other hand you say everyone has beauty. It's the same old crap... on one hand the makeup artist says Be Youself, You're beautiful. and on the other hand, she says.... but you really want to look like THIS... you really want to look like THIS. Some good tips, but the overall voice of Bobbi turned me off."
1,restrictive and boring makeup lessons,"bobbi brown's makeup philosohpy is boring and way too restrictive. bobbi brown says in her book, 'i have purposely avoided colors like emerald green, turquoise, and purple. that's because i would much rather let a woman's own eye color pop out than make a bold statement with the shadow shade.' instead, she suggests using lots of brown shadows to look 'natural'. if i wanted to look natural, i wouldn't wear makeup at all. color eyeshadows are what make my brown eyes pop out. most of her suggestions are totally off based. this book is no fun. check out kevyn aucoin's book, 'making faces' instead. now there's a man who knows what makeup is about."
3,Useful for absolute beginners,"I love makeup and I've been wearing it since I was 16. I was looking for a book that would update my makeup techniques and perhaps give me a new, fresher look. Unfortunately, this wasn't the book for that. Although it provides very useful information for beginners or makeup virgins, it doesn't help if you already know the basics and are looking for the next level in makeup application."
3,not the best i've read....,"I consider makeup to be an important part of my everyday appearance. And this book really didn't deliver on anything more than everyday, easy to learn tricks that i gathered when i was 14 from Glamour. Not my fave makeup book, but there are a few good spots"
3,Ok - not great,"I bought this book - thinking I'd get some great revelation out of it or some insider secrets I didn't know about. I was sadly mistaken. I have gotten the same tips from beauty magazines.It would be nice if she had more illustrations that showed the application of makeup, step-by-step, which is why people who buy these kinds of books (including myself) are looking for.She did cover makeup for different ethnicities - however, there was not information on technique.If you're looking for a general book about makeup but not so much about technique - this is for you."
3,better options...,I found Bobbi Brown's series of makeup books to be a bit boring and redundant. A much better option is anything by Kevyn Aucoin.
1,DISAPPOINTMENT,"As of 9/7/09, I have not received my book. I have tried to contact the seller with no response what so ever. I am so tired of ordering things from Amazon that I get charged for but never get. This is my last time ordering from Amazon."
1,Grossly lacking in content,"This book is beautifully presented and well written. For those of you who are interested on one persons perspective on make-up, it might be interesting. For those who are looking to learn more about beauty and make-up, I wouldn't advise you to buy this book. As a make-up beginner the knowledge I have gained by reading this book could be summed up in 5 minutes."
4,A MUST!!!,"This book is one of the best OVERALL beauty book that I own. If you need a book that will tell you about skin care as well as makeup, from your twenties to... actually, until you stop wearing makeup!, than this book is the one. Although there are special sections for African-Americans, Asian-American, Hispanics,... she doesn't limit the examples to these sections. She gives examples through out the whole book. And you WILL keep referring to it. This book is the winner of the Best Overall Beauty Book (as she also talks about body care and inner beauty)."
5,A great book for any age woman!,"I bought this book at $30!! I wish I checked here before buying it at the book store! Anyway, this book is great for the beauty beginer or the beauty expert and any age woman because it covers teenagers, women over 50 and more. If you only are going to buy one beauty book this is it!"
3,Good but not very good for Japanese...,I thought it was good for white women but I didn't like the part for Asian women. The author limits the color variation that we can use. I personally don't agree with her. And I'm 20 years old. But the tips were too conservative for me. This book might be good for the women who want to look natural.
3,Not as good at is sounds,"I was very disappointed with the book. I have been wearing makeup since I was 15. I take it as my hobby and what I needed was a book that could show me different techniques, different ways of applying makeup other than the usual ways I was taught over the years, different color combinations. This book is REALLY BASIC. It really does not give you a step by step in how to achieve a certain look. So if this is what you are looking for go for another book."
3,"Adequate, but heavy-handed","After reading and enjoying Kevyn Aucoin's makeup books, Bobbi Brown seems a bit ham-fisted in her approach -- a bit more ""don't EVER do this, don't EVER wear that"" than I'd like to see in a makeup book. Bobbi's technique will leave you looking natural and gorgeous, but there isn't much room for experimentation or originality."
1,Boring,"This book's a quick read and if you're a regular magazine reader, you won't pick up much. The best part was the colour suggestions for eyeliner etc based on your colouring, but Bobbi's philosophy of always looking natural has resulted in a book which doesn't cover all the bases you'd want it to - some women want to play with their look as well, not just have a minimalist look all the time.I'd recommend Stephanie Seymour's ""Beauty Secrets for Dummies"" (part of the ""Dummies"" series) which is excellent and contains more tips, and Kevyn Aucoin's ""Making Faces"" which really inspires you to unleash your creativity and try different looks."
3,Affordable paperback of the makeup artist's beauty book,"This is a basic book for anyone somewhat interested in makeup. Bobbi Brown covers a number of special topics but most of the info is for real life and quite practical. This book includes BB's life, philosophy and ideas on diet, exercise and skin care. Special sections on African-American, Asian, Latina, pregnancy, bridal, teenage and 40 plus beauty. Good notes on makeup for photography and television. Interesting sections on makeup brushes, simple 10 step makeup application, use of concealers, foundation & powder, brows, eyes and blush. Overall a pretty boring book for any one really interested in makeup but good for those that are not ""obsessed"" with cosmetics."
2,The Book About Nothing,"Bobbi Brown does a terrible job ""sharing"" her secrets. The book is more about how great she is, than actual help to real-world women. The book is so general that only a person who has no tiny idea about makeup and color theory can find something new in there. Her advice is more a common sense than a professional approach. There is absolutely nothing for women with light skin, hair, and eyes.Overall, if you want to know something new and valuable about the makeup, look somewhere else."
2,Disappointing,"For being such a make-up MASTER, Bobbi Brown sure didn't show it in this book. Very dull and unexciting, not to mention anyone who's ever put on eyeliner could tell you the same tips."
4,Brown mascara?,"Upon reviewing this book, I found that Bobbi is quite fond of brown mascara as the basic color for all people. Well, I have black hair and blacker eyelashes and I've tried brown mascara (I didn't look at the label) and it looks VERY STRANGE on black eyelashes. It looked pretty artificial. Other than that, this book was ok although I prefer Kevyn Aucoin's book ""Making Faces"" over this one."
3,"Too, Too Long!","This book may be good for the woman who knows little about makeup and its application, but it is much too long winded. Each product has about 3 to 4 pages of instructions (you don't need that much instruction on how to apply lipstick, not even the beginner). Ms. Brown also covers too many subjects, and gets into fields she is not qualified to advise on, such as fitness and diet (she's a professional makeup artist not a dietician or physical instructor). Also some of her makeup advise is odd and does not work (ie; line your lips AFTER you have applied your lipstick - Huh?). My advise is skip this one and buy Morgen Schick's ""Your Makeover""."
5,Powerful little heater at a great price!,"We purchased the King 2000-watt electric wall heater for an 11' x 11' room that is not attached to our house. It is a powerful little heater that warms the whole room in a short amount of time. We added the T-Kit thermostat, which works well at regulating the temperature."
2,Not worth the read,"I had to read this book for my English class and it actually has an interesting plot. However, it did not hold up or follow through the way I had thought it would. This book bored me so much. There are exciting parts, but they are so far apart that it's hard to keep interest. Orleanna's parts sound like a depressed teenager plagued by guilt. Ruth May's parts are so childishly written that they seem out of place in the novel. Adah's parts make her seem condescending sometimes. Rachel's parts are usually just a waste of pages. Leah is the only character who seems to have an actual development, but most of her parts in the beginning are slow and not very interesting.Honestly, half of this book could be ripped out and it still would not have been very good. I wish I hadn't wasted my time reading this in hopes that it would get better, because it didn't."
3,Depressing portrayal of Africa,"Four young girls accompany their missionary father and their mother to a Congolese village, and none of them manages to truly leave Africa again, although each reacts to the place in a completely different way, with a completely different outcome. I would not call this story, in which the naive family survives famine, drought, malaria, crocodiles and ant infestations, particularly uplifting. In fact, it is a downright depressing examination of the problems of Africa compounded by Westerners' attempts to bring our god and our ways into a completely alien culture."
3,Surviving,"This is a story of children and adults growing and making decisions, sometimes for the better but sometimes not. It's frustrating and depressing to read about their actions, which means, of course, that it's well-written. I may read it again to catch more of the symbolism. I suggest a reading group for this one!"
5,Amazing!,"I started this book after I had surgery as a way to pass time and I regret not reading it earlier. Poisonwood Bible contains the rich story of a family of a reverend, his wife and four daughters. Each daughter brings her own perspective to the novel and I love the language and the plot itself. It rarely had a dull spot that didn't pertain to the plot or development of characters, which in a large book means a lot. I will admit it is more for women than men, but I think everyone can take something from this book."
5,Superb Read,"I thought this book was just amazing. For me, a good book is separated from a great book by four things: story, writing style, what I learn while I am reading it, and pace. The Poisonwood Bible gets 5 stars from me on all counts.The story here is intricate, interesting, and cleverly told. The writing style is like a rich, luxurious tapestry, made so especially since there are 5 different voices narrating the tale. I learned so much about the Congo, its traditions, roots, and struggles. I loved despising Reverend Price, and all his abysmally misguided,bigoted religious buffoonery. I did not want to put this book down. I savored every moment I was reading it.Although there are lots of good books out there, true gems like the Poisonwood Bible are harder to find. You will not be disappointed."
1,Over-Rated,"While she tells a mildly interesting yarn about a missionary's family, Kingsolver approaches the complexities that are Africa in an insultingly patronizing way. She draws on the ""noble save"" theory of Rousseau and romantically glosses over what corrupt and vicious Marxist governments have done to the people of this beseiged continent in the last few decades.Pure pap."
1,A book I just couldn't get into,"I've heard from many people that this is a book you either love, or hate. For me, I just couldn't get into it. My friend, a big reader, told me that this book was one of her ""all time favorites"". With such a fabulous referral, I had to read it.The story seems interesting: A Southern pastor and his family travel on a mission to the Congo. I kept reading, thinking that I would become captured if I just read a few pages more. One hundred pages into the book, however, I finally gave up.My advice is to probably give this book a try. There are many people that loved it. I'm just one of those that didn't."
2,Author's social agenda takes over,"I found this book exhausting, irritating and preachy. I slogged through it as I felt compelled to learn about the fates of these four women. Kingsolver is a talented author but this work is burdened by her obsession with a social justice agenda."
2,"trite, annoying","I guess I expected a lot more from this book,as I did like her earlier books. I found the characters inane, the writing poor, and very annoying with her cutsie on-purpose mistakes like ""Thyroid Mary"" and the stupid palindromes. Enough already, stop trying so hard as just tell the story."
4,the dark continent...,"I don't know really what I was expecting from this book and it was a little slow to start, but soon discovered myself pulled in and enjoying every page of it! I thought the story was well-told and kept my interest. The format added to the story as well...getting to hear various sides of the story from different characters was a unique way to go, but effective and gave the feeling at times that you were flipping through different books. This was especially true as time went on and the family members all parted ways. I'd recommend it definitely, but would warn that you need to push through the first few chapters to really get into the story."
4,wow,"an excellent if somewhat difficult read. The Poisonwood Bible will make you think and wonder about the lives and comfrots we all have, and it will make you cherish your loved ones even more."
5,a work of art,"I have always been a fan of Barbara Kingsolver, and I think this is her masterpiece. Obviously a lot of work went into this book. It was so insightful and enjoyable that I had to read it twice."
5,Best Ever,"Next to THE BIBLE, it is the best written book I've ever read. I recently bought a 1/2 dozen more copies to give to my best friends and family. Barbara Kingsolvers ability to jump from one character to another reminds me a bit of Robin Williams nearly insane ability to do the same. You'll find yourself identifying with one of the characters perspective, from which the story is told. A story of a family of 3 daughters, and a missionary couple headed from Georgia to the Congo, this novel will lead you to laugh and cry.It took two years for my wife to get me to pick up this book. I listened to it on audio CD and then read it. Simply Superb and now I want to read some of the author's other books."
1,Amateur writing,"Sooooo disappointing; I saw all these wonderful reviews from so many newspapers and I thought it would be wonderful. I love stories set in Africa, regardless of the era. After the first 100 pages, the book seemed like it would never end. I felt it was a book written for children, from the point of view of 4 children. Definitely not a book for someone who enjoys good literature!"
2,Too many voices,"By telling the story of a missionary family in the Congo at the time of Mobuto's rise to power, Kingsolver makes a valiant effort to inform and interest the reader in an event that Americans have little understanding. But in her use of different narrator (The four daughter of the missionary and his wife)Kingsolver fails to convince the reader that her narrators are speaking in their own ""voices."" From a far too precocious 5 year old,the tomboy and her crippled genius twin, whose knack for palindromes and clever word play only distracted from the narrative, to the eldest child who seems to get less intelligent as time goes on, each character becomes less believable as the book continues on (and on and on...)A great book may have been written about this time of upheaval, this is just a missed opportunity."
2,Didn't Finish,"Right of I just wanted to say that I didn't finish this Book. I found it hard to get into and I was periodically skiping lines to try to get to something good that might be in the book. In my opinion, if you can't wait untill you're in the 300's before you get into a book, then you should not be reading this book. The reason I did not like this book is because it was continuously repetitive. Narrators changed throughout the whole book but the story kept on repeating itself."
2,She did not find the real voice,"Arguably, this is her most ""worked"" book, but she came short in her effort. The transplation to the middle of Africa, the way the daughters talk, the way the novel resolves, all created a sort of false atmoshpere.It was intelligent to use the girls as narrators, but this, paradoxically, and after the difficulties of establishing themselves, formed a non credible situation, and thus, the novel lost strength.Perhaps it's time to start an interesting discussion about marketing and literature, and what deserves to go to print, or, at least, invest big marketing dollars"
1,Baptist Basher,"Ms. Kingsolver can certainly write a book. However, she uses this book as a forum to bash religion and men. She is so OFF-BASE about baptist religion. Baptists do not believe in infant baptism, nor do they believe you can ""stand in the rain and lay hands on children and baptize them"", believers in Christ are baptised when they make a personal profession of faith in him. If Ms. Kingsolver is so OFF-BASE on the issue of baptism, one can only speculate she could be OFF-BASE on the political issues as well. I shall never read another Oprah Winfrey Book Club selection!!!!!"
2,A history lesson and a boring novel.,This book goes on and on about a lot of things. The author uses too many descriptions to describe simple things. I didn't feel sympathy at all for any of the characters. I felt that reading that very thick book was a waste of my time. I love to read but I didn't get any satisfaction from reading this book.
4,A story that stays with you,"The Poisonwood Bible is an excellent chronicle of one family's evolution. My only complaint is that it peaks too early, with the novel's climax coming around page 350 -- with 200 pages left to wind down. I felt like each of the characters was very rich and well developed. My favorite was the mother, whose voice we rarely got to hear. But when she did narrate a chapter, it seemed she was answering all the questions the reader would be asking/demanding of her. I felt very emotionally attached to these characters, as the author did a formidable job of developing their fully believable, individual personas."
3,"Beautifully written, disappointing ending","I was enamored with Kingsolver's writing style in this novel, I found it beautiful, witty and moving. I was somewhat disappointed in the ending. I did not feel that Rachel deserved to become the weak, self centered woman that Kingsolver made her. She became ridiculously stupid. I also felt that Kingsolver became preachy and too political with Leah's character, which was ironic because I think Kingsolver's intention was to condemn preachiness and intolerance. I was satisfied with Orleanna's character and Adah's character was beautiful and refreshing."
4,Fascinating!,"A Missionary and his family in Africa. The author combines religious zeal, politics, rebels, war, separation and survival into a moving, graphic tale of redemption. Alternately tragic, harsh, yet beautiful. Highly recommended reading. You won't be able to put this book down."
5,Wonderful!,"I am still reading this book and enjoying it immensely. My comment is to others reviewing the book or thinking about reviewing it. Please don't divulge events such as a death of a character. It's rather like hearing someone give away the end of a movie. I have yet to reach a point where a character dies in the Poisonwood Bible but thanks to a few reviews, I already know she does. I can appreciate enthusiasm from reviewers but feel this kind of review borders on spoiling another's reading experience."
3,I Wanted More-Or maybe less?,"There is no doubt that Kingsolver has a gift for words. Her representation of Adah was my favorite. But some of her charachters fall flat, namely Rachel, Ruth May, and the Father. The length of the book was also a pain. A book 1/2 the size, with more texture in a few charachters would have been great. It was a good one time read."
2,Stuck on page 438,"Eventhough I enjoyed the chapters individually, I had a hard time following this narrative as told through the eyes of Nathan Price's wife and his four daughters. The book as a whole is not better than the sum of its parts. Disjointed I'd have to say...but oddly interesting. Some day I will finish the last 105 pages...but I am in no rush as I am now reading Stolen Lives by Malika Oufkir (much better)...no I did not buy the book based upon Oprah's recommendation, I bought it in spite of it!!"
1,Forget it!,"I could not wait to read this book! I love Kingsolver's writing, and have read 3 other books by her, all terrific. I labored to get half-way through the Poisonwood Bible. Not being one to stop in the middle of any book, it was with great relief that I broke this habit, after my friend spoke similar feelings and revealed the rest of the book to me. I left it in the motel I was in, for anyone else interested. I could not, w/good conscience, recommend or give it to anyone!Yes, Kingsolver is a fine writer, but this book was monotonous, boring, depressing, and as dredging as the topic it undertakes. 250 pages into it, and I could still not keep the daughters' names connected to their personalities. If I want to be bored, depressed, or confused, I'll watch the news. I so strongly disliked this book that I've undertaken my first book review. Pity."
1,Most excruciating read,I would never recommend this book to anyone it hurts my soul that other people enjoyed it.
1,Uggh...Shoot Me Now,"This was the worst book I have ever read. By about the 35th page, I was simply lost in a confusion of boredom. Poor characterization, and lack of steady plot forced me to only be able to read about 50 pages at a time. If you want to retain your will to live, do not read this book."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING,This book came highly recommended but it's just plain awful. I kept reading hoping it would get better but it just got worse and worse. After finishing this book I made a decision that life was too short to spend any time sticking with books that are clearly rubbish on the off-chance that they'll improve toward the end.The characters are neither believable nor likeable and some parts of the plot are so harebrained that I actually found myself feeling embarrassed for the author.
1,Not the best pick for a first-time Kingsolver reader...,"Don't hate me for dissing this book, but as a reader who LOVED Animal Dreams (by Kingsolver), I couldn't get into The Poisonwood Bible. The main thing that bothered me was that each chapter is narrated by one of four sisters. They have interesting personalities but I kept getting them confused. Their voices weren't unique enough for me to distinguish. That structure grew tiresome and I stopped reading the book after about 50 pages.I also found the topic of a Baptist family moving to Africa to convert people off-putting. Even though it is supposed to be set in the past, I don't want to relive that time period and be reminded of that kind of mentality.The Poisonwood Bible should not be the first novel you pick up by Kingsolver. A better sampling would be Animal Dreams. It is more accessible to the reader."
3,"Remember, it's a novel!","This is an interesting novel, but I am concerned that naive readers may believe that the book provides a true picture of missionaries and their work. After all, not many people have had the opportunity to work for extended periods in isolated parts of Africa. I did so, for a number of years working on the transmission of tropical diseases, which often put me in contact with, and dependent on missionaries of various faiths. I can assure the reader that the characters in the novel have nothing in common with reality, nor is it necessary they should. But it is something to keep in mind."
4,Poisonwood Bible for kindle,"This book is a classic example of why you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover. Initially starting out slow, the plot gets better and better with the initial character development out of the way. The plot draws the reader in deeper as we follow a slightly off-kilter pastor from Georgia into the hostile environment of one of Africas' wildest nations...where everything seems to go wrong. The author segregates the book into Bible-inspired chapters, each continuing the story from a totally different perspective.I was initially concerned that the book would be a little too 'God-preachy' for a normal everyday read, but Poisonwood isn't like that at all.In short, Barbara Kingsolver's The Poisonwood Bible is a must read. Fantastic plot twists, superb climax, and a conclusion that satisfies."
4,Writing well is the best revenge.,"I feel like I'm from another planet when I read comments saying that the first half of the Poisonwood Bible is hard to get through. The four voices are witty, insightful, at times engagingly clueless, and all in the midst of the full force gale of FAMILY. Add being semi-trapped in the Congo, a place I knew hardly anything about beforehand but rapidly came to know thanks to Kingsolver, and this is a definite can't-put-it-down book. By the time the ants invade, if you're not completely into this story, please check your pulse. If anything, I was a little let down once they leave their ramshackle place in the Congo. Then it's just another story about female angst. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Anyway, this is a lovely book."
4,or how not to do missions!,"This is a really good book that is a basic bible for how not to do missions. I resisted reading this for years, but now I'm glad I did. I really got to know th characters deeply and disagree with other reviewers who feel that the characters were shallow. I enjoyed the short chapters which presented each set of circumstances from each of the five voices. A bit frustrating at the end when the author chose to simply report on different chunks of time from each of the 4 remaining women's lives. I felt the sting of death deeply during the reading of this book.I highly recommend this book and find myself intrigued with a wonderful part of the world whose native peoples have been subjected to horrifying circumstances and world politics."
2,Not as I expected....,"After reading such great reviews, I decided to give the Poisonwood Bible a chance. I wasn't disappointed, but I wasn't entirely thrilled reading this book. The author is great with descriptive words, although at times she did get a bit wordy; the story overall lacked excitement. I did not find the book compelling."
2,Not for me thanks.,"This is a character driven story as you may have read from other reviewers. Each character is very rich in description and motivation. However, there emotions are so extreme as if to prove pts about society. The good people in this book are sooo good and of course the bad are sooo villainous. I didn't care for most of the characters because to me they seemed very flat."
1,The First Summer Assignment Book,"I wanted to like this book, I truly did. I have liked many of the books we've read for school, long and short. But this was simply awful. I couldn't even make myself like the characters, with the exception of the cussing bird, which was simply funny. The characters were flat and unchanging, and I completely agree with the post who mentioned all the mistakes Kingsolver made with Baptist rituals. I don't like to be preached at in any situation, but I especially hate it when it's in the guise of a real story. Whether or not I would've read any of Kingsolver's other books before I read this one, I cannot say. But I do know that I'll never read another one."
1,I didn't finish it...,"I didn't finish this book. I got 90% of the way through, got over it, and never finished it.The thing about this book is that it didn't make me want to read and read and never put it down. It was long, and tedious, and drawn out, and it didn't seem to have any structure. There were no highs and lows and expectations to keep you reading. It was just - boring.I was particularly drawn to any of the characters. I did feel like I was there in the Congo - but as soon as they left there, then it all went downhill for me.No structure."
2,Not worth it.,"I was forced to read this novel for my English class, and I must say it's not something I'll be reading again.I give Barbara Kingsolver a well-deserved compliment for her ability to use amazing figurative language, and this novel contains a large amount. The concept behind the story is somewhat interesting, but after the first half of the book, the plot becomes rather pointless and boring.Kingsolver uses the last 250-300 pages to write a political satire which is not needed, since she had made her point throughout the first half. She also drags us through the next thirty or so years of the characters' lives, and it becomes extremely trivial.Most of the time the story is just way too drawn-out and can give you a headache.The book was not AS bad as I thought it would be (considering what I had heard about it), and Kingsolver can certainly write, so I will give her two stars.HOWEVER, I would NOT recommend this book to anyone."
3,I don't understand the fuss,I do not get what everyone has been raving about. I found the book longwinded and hard to follow. I did not relate to the characters and found them unsympathetic. I finished it because I felt I had to.....hoping that it would click eventually. It did not.
4,The Poisonwood Bible,"This is a very good book! I felt happy and sad all at the same time. This family goes through so much, and loses so much. At times a little hard to follow, but that is part of the book. I learned alot about what people go through and how people live in other countries. I feel so blessed to live in the great USA."
4,another great from kingsolver,"This book was a little hard to get into at first, but it was definitely worth reading. It was not my favorite book by kingsolver but i thought it was a great read."
1,Just when you though it could not get worse!,"I think I would have gotten more enjoyment out of this novel if I had read it in German, which I dont speak. Even sounding out multi-syllabic words like a baby would be more enjoyable then understanding 400 pages of absolute garbage. I regret the 10 hours of my life I wasted reading this book. I could have been doing much more productive things, like staring at a wall or counting to ten a million times. But unfortunately, that time is lost, and now I just have to wait and answer to God when he punishes me for wasting so much of my precious life on absolutely boring and mindless prose."
1,There are Christians and then there are Christians,"I enjoyed many of the wry observations made through Adah and found some of the use of language by other characters quite beautiful. However, I was disappointed that none Nathan's daughters discovered true Christianity as they matured and wriggled out from under his brand of God's love. It doesn't wring true that a person,for example Leah, would truly be seeking God and not find Him. And for those of you who are thinking that she did, there is evidence of God in his creation, but He is NOT his creation."
1,TERRIBLE,"This is the worst book i have ever read...It put me to sleep after every third page...It had no plot...It did not go anywhere...I would have stoped reading after the 10th page, but i was required to read this garbage for school...DONT READ THIS BOOK"
3,Fundamentalism in sheepskin,"Wonderful writing, but not my style. I got up to a dozen pages or so, and was worn out by all the hardships the narrator had to endure. A tad of a whiner & I'm not in the mood. I normally don't enjoy reading books with ""accents"" worked into the sentence, so you are forced to read like a southerner."
1,awful book,this is the worst book i have ever read---it put me to sleep i had to read it for school and it was dreadful
4,Oren's review,"The Poisonwood Bible takes place in the Congo in the 1950's and 60's. It is about a family with a preacher for a father that is trying to christianize the natives. He is of no help to his family and they go thourgh hard times. When they are suggested to leave because a civil war was just won, but the father choses for them to stay. The rest of the book is about what happens to the family.If you make it through the first one hundrad pages it is a great book. The beginning of the book is a bit too slow but after that it has a lot more action. It has incredible detail that makes you feel like you are there in the jungle trying to survive. It is incredble to think about what a hard time the American would have to been in the Congo with no previous training in the languge or culture."
2,Too many voices,"By telling the story of a missionary family in the Congo at the time of Mobuto's rise to power, Kingsolver makes a valiant effort to inform and interest the reader in an event that Americans have little understanding. But in her use of different narrators (The four daughters of the missionary and his wife)Kingsolver fails to convince the reader that her narrators are speaking in their own ""voices."" From a far too precocious 5 year old,the tomboy and her crippled genius twin, whose knack for palindromes and clever word play only distracted from the narrative, to the eldest child who seems to get less intelligent as time goes on, each character becomes less believable as the book continues on (and on and on...)A great book may have been written about this time of upheaval, this is just a missed opportunity."
2,Too many stereotypes,"I struggled to get through this book. It certainly has some good points. The contrast in cultures is interesting, as is the drama of following a family as they venture to a new land. However, the book just perpetuates too many stereotypes. There's the narrowminded, arrogant white evangelical Christian man and his emotionally neglected wife. There's the four kids who, judging by the quality of their writing, are far smarter than any of the adults in the book. It's just too predictable...and horribly depressing."
3,The poison wood bible,"At the begining I found the book to be boring and hard to follow becuse I couldn't pay attention. After I got passed a few books then it started to actually get good. The beining is just a lot of background information, of corse is necessary but i don't like all that. So if you have the patients to wait to get into a book then i'm sure you'll enjoy it, other wise if you're like me and you like a book to jump right to the point then i would suggest reading something else."
5,Oprah's pick--Poisonwood Bible`,"I found it to be very well written and extremely captivating. A man chooses his Teachings of God to 3rd world over his own family. The writter gives such good wording, it makes you feel you're right where they are. I enjoyed it immensely. Hope you enjoy it also."
5,An excellent read! One of my favorite books!,"I hated to see this book end! I wanted it to continue following the lives of the family that lived (lives) in the Congo. It's VERY interesting and educational all at the same time. The author has an interesting way of writing each chapter through the eyes of one of the characters. I have to say that when I started the first chapter, I almost put the book down. It was in English but hard to understand what it was saying. There was a reason for that which you'll learn as you read more chapters. I usually don't keep fiction books but this is one I enjoyed so much I'll keep it so I can read it again in the future."
1,Disappointing,"I have read all of Barbara Kingsolver's novel and loved every one of them-except for this one. Wordy, boring, unfeeling. For a good Kingsolver novel, try Pigs in Heaven or The Bean Trees."
3,Kingsolver's journey into Africa,"My first Kingsolver novel. Reading this book is much like the journey taken by the price family: Long, interesting, laborious, and ultimately rewarding.Kingsolver developes her characters incredibly well. We are annoyed by some, intrigued by others, and are moved deeply by their stories. Her characters never stray from their personality, and sadly, also fail to grow much (with the exception of the daughter with a disability--). But you feel as if you know incredibly well by the end of the book.Her prose and pace are even and her word pictures draw you in and you can see through her eyes, feel the jungle above you, hear the hum of the mosquitos, smell the dank air of the village.There are important lessons to learn in this book--one of open-mindedness, humility, and true Christianity; however in the end those conclusions are skimmed over and the focus settles on a political theme.Still the writing is excellent, the journey through the book a worthwile one."
4,A Well Spun Tale,"This is the first of Kingsolver's books that I have read, and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. Her characters were well drawn and complex. Her descriptions were vivid and the story was engrossing.My one complaint was that the book seemed to climax about three-quarters in, and then it just leveled off. However, I would still recommend this book to any and all."
5,"Exquisitely written, many layered story telling","Having just returned from Africa, I was hungry for more about the mysterious and facinating continent. Kingsolver is my all-time favorite writer, so I was delighted to read the book and savored its length and detail. Now, I need something else to read but fear that nothing will satisfy me as this book has. I feel a great deal like I did when I finished The Handmaid's Tale. Thought provoking, troubling and delicious book, makes me want to talk about it to everyone. I love the evolution of the characters and the history that I learned from reading. I am still wondering what to read now. I hope to use this book in my high school literature classes."
4,A challenging story of birth order and African history.,"A truly great read from the perspective of African Congo history. The story was told through the eyes of four, very different sisters. It was well written, and a beleivable story on most all counts. Kingsolver did her homework, and it shows.This is not an easy read. It's challenging and requires some focus and determination. It was more a history lesson for me, than a story of a family experiencing tradgedy and healing.I recommend it and only caution you to be prepared for a confusing and long journey through the lives a dysfunctional family."
3,"Great first half, then downhill.","The Poisonwood Bible is an interesting story of a family thrown into turmoil by their move from a Southern state to the Congo. Motivated by the Father's rabid belief that only through Christian baptism and beliefs could the local people be ""saved"", the 4 daughters and the wife become distanced from him and begin to question his judgement. I found the book interesting and enlightening until it turned into an anti-American rant during the last fourth of the story."
4,This book was the most well written book I have ever read.,"The Poisonwood Bible is a wonderfully written account of four sisters and their mother who have been taken to the Congo at the whim of their hypocritically religious, missionary father. I found the book extremely easy to read, and even easier to enjoy.I really enjoyed the books diversity...using each girl's/woman's perspective to narrate different situations. I particularly enjoyed how the characters evolved into completely different people as their experience in the Congo affected them. They became what they never expected.This was not the best book I have ever read, but it was close. I found myself enjoying the authors choice of words, as well as her symbolism. I definitely forgot myself, and became an observer of the family as it struggled in the foreign environment of the Congo."
2,"Vivid and colorful, but way to slow","I must be the exception rather than the rule but I didn't enjoy this novel. I highly anticipated the arrival of Kingsolver's newest book. Although vivid in description of the Congo and its lush surroundings, I found it difficult to like the characters.The story seemed to jump to much and at times and tended to get way to ""wordy"". The book was purchased in October and I just finished it tonight.(this is very rare for me to take this long) I found myself hoping the story would pick up and for me it just never did. To sum it up.....250 pages would have been sufficient to tell the same story. ""It just wasn't Bean Trees""."
1,Liberal Bias,"In this book the portrayal of the characters generally follow this unfair pattern; if your a woman you are good. If you live in a third world country you are good. If you are a white male you are bad. That's kind of it in a nutshell. Also, this book attacks the United States. Personally, I'm tired of this kind of hatred directed at me and my country. In this book the US can do no good, no matter what. Negative, negative negative. This books political viewpoint is very, very one sided. And not for me. I did finish the entire book, for my wife."
1,"Yes, Oprah has done it again.","Why in the world Oprah would want to show a book like this on her show is beyond me, it was the most backbone-breaking, SLOW, BORINGEST book I have ever read, and believe me, (I have read a lot). I am real sick of Oprah Windfree and her retarded ideas, my wife likes to sit on the couch, eat doughnuts, and watch Oprah all day while Im at work, she has ALL of the shows taped. Just because of this book, I am divorcing my wife."
3,Okay,"This book was okay but I really can't understand all the tremendous hype. For my money (which isn't much) the character I liked best was Nathan. The women were weak, simpering fools and, as a former reviewer noted, it is hard to identify with fools. I wish the author had done more with Nathan. He was strong. A real man. I liked the way he dominated the women. But Kingsolver rarely let us see much of this enigmatic and fascinating man. Had the book focused on the wonderful character of Nathan and his thoughts and feelings I probably would have given it five stars. But it was still an interesting story."
3,"Enjoyable, until the end","Kingsolver has written a beautiful book of women's voices. I believe she handles the different voices of her characters very well, skillfully showing us the different impact the experience of the Congo had on each, and how it shaped their lives. Like others, I enjoyed the book until Ms. Kingsolver switched from story to political diatribe. I believe she conveyed the political situation well through the characters earlier and that her final chapters were simply preaching as if we, like Nathan's congregation, just didn't get it.....so she decided to pound it into our heads, much like Nathan's final ""baptizism"" of the children. Ironic, huh?"
3,Should have been much shorter retrohs hcum neeb evah dluohs,"This book started out great. The subject matter was fascinating, and I enjoyed hearing the story from each of the four daughters' points of view. However, after about the halfway point, it just got boring, suddenly becoming almost solely about politics. If I wanted to read a boring, seemingly endless treatise on African politics, I'm sure I'd be able to find several in the nonfiction section, but I read for enjoyment, not to feel bad. I also found the mother's narratives to be very boring and hard to follow. And please, let's never again be burdened with another character whose mental tic makes her spell everything both backwards and forwards! You'd think Ms. Kingsolver was getting paid by the word."
2,A Book that Begs for a Discussion Group,"The five Price women, mother Orleanna, daughters Rachel, Leah, Adah, and little Ruth May tell of their trials the year their father Nathan took the family to the Congo in answer to his mission call. Each of the women tells of her experiences, but this disjointed style does not tie a story together. Each person tells their version of seperate incidents. While the others may refer to an episode, the reader only gets one person's perspective of the incident. A perplexity pervaded as to how the story tied together. By the end of the book, the conclusion was that the story is how the time in the Congo affected the futures of the Price women.Recently it was suggested that this is more of a literary work--the richness of the words and the pictures they paint are the story. Quite true. The reader needs to savor the prose and not rush through the book looking for the tale."
1,A leading cause of depression among readers,"I have read all of Barbara Kingsolver's previous books, essays, and short stories. I enjoyed them all. That is not the case with The Poisonwood Bible. I found this book depressing, preachy, and not at all enjoyable. I felt like reading this book was a penance I was being forced to do. I donated it to the local public library, so maybe I can save some other unsuspecting reader from having to pay for it. I got the message that the white man should not change the Africans way of life, and that culture is a function of environment. I hope Ms. Kingsolver has done her preaching for her career, and can get back to writing that is of the high quality of her earlier works. She does not have the only truth, as the Baptist missionary did not have it in this pitiful novel,"
1,A total disappointment from a consistently good author,"This is the only book I have ever returned to Amazon -- I couldn't bear to own it a minute longer. Kingsolver jumps into new territory with this latest novel and from page 1 you have nothing to hold onto. Chapters jump from one of five characters, Kingsolver's interpretation of young thoughts, teenage insecurities, adult regret is nothing but contrived. I am an avid reader, enjoy challenges, but this just left me wondering who Kingsolver is writing for and why she went so wrong with this book. She's lost one formerly devoted reader."
2,Political piece,None of the characters was worth investigation. All were handling a poor situation very poorly. The author is clearly against US policy of the time and against the Bible as a world book.
4,Eye-opening,"This is a superb book, and a must read if you want to understand the mind of Africa.What struck me most about this book is the insight it gives into the development of Africa. The details are almost an aside, a flicker in the plot, but by the time I had finished I understood far more the terrible rage that burns in this land. Barbara Kingsolver handles it with great sensitivity, but she does not hide the role that the West has had in creating (and washing its hands of) Central Africa."
3,over 5 years later... still nothing,"I bought this book when I was about 14 years old. I'm a book-worm and usually almost inhale literature. For example I finished The Life of Pi in 8 hours. But with this book it's been 5 years and I've never been able to finish it. I've picked it up many times and though the story seems interesting it's difficult to get into the world Kingsolver has created. I find myself putting it down and finding something else after only a few pages.This has nothing to do with her writing style or the storyline. Just a warning to those of you who prefer more action, fun, or fast paced books. Or younger people like myself, it's probably not something you want to buy.I'm going to keep it on my shelf for a few more years and give it another try. Maybe I'll be able to read it when I'm older?"
2,A bit of a snoozer,Although I felt the book was well written overall it could not keep my attention. The book spouted off too much religous jargen and I cannot say I enjoyed the ending. As a matter of fact I had to force myself to read the ending.
2,Quite boring...,"This book is quite boring. The story is toooo slow... you can practicall fall asleep, plus the characters are not very likable. I found it very hard to identify with any of them. There have been very few ocassions when I have found myself skipping pages of a book in order to finish it but this was definitely one of them."
4,"Wonderful,thought provoaking read","I have read most of Barbarba's earlier books, and found them funny and loving. I picked up this book, out of couriousity and started on the winding emotional and historical journey of the Piosonwood Bible. Wonderfully written, albeit somewhat different form her earlier works, but no less touching. She opens the readers eyes to a different world, where you will question the Industrialized nations' commerical,obsession with ""things"". The characters are amazing...heroic...weak...human. Do yourself a favor pick this up today."
4,What you've heard about this book is true,"I was reluctant to buy this book, given that it strayed so far from her stories situated in the Southwest that I've loved so much. After hearing from friends for the past few years how wonderful it was, I finally picked it up -- and have been truly rewarded!It's an amazing book -- one of the rare books that creates a real dilema when you are nearly through with it: ""What am I going to do when I finish this book?""If you are discouraged from reading this book by the thought that this is just another of the ""Americans-go-to-Africa..."" genre, set that thought aside and prepare for a whirlwind of a journey. Kingsolver delights the reader with her poetic, playful and truly witty prose, and her accute sense of observation of human nature."
5,An All-Time Favorite,"This is an excellent book. A stunning achievement of character development, plot, theme, description & all things related to writing & fiction. It is a huge book, but the long read is something to savor ... I was actually sad when the book ended. I completely disagree with reviewers who said the second half seemed slower than the first half (What can I say? Perhaps those readers were anxious to get to bed?) or that the character of Rachel isn't as strong as the others. Rachel is the least likeable character, by design; not a flaw of the writer but a flawed narrator (Come on, folks, that's the point!) And the characters age in this book, so the slightly changed perspectives of the characters in the second half are appropriate and revealing. This is an exceptional book, one you definitely want to own rather than check out from the library, as you'll want to read it again and again."
4,"It is a STORY, and a good one at that","I felt this was a really good story although initially I had problems getting through it because I hated the intolerance of the characters so much. Ms. Kingsolver writes persuasively and engagingly from each character's point of view throughout the story. So, if you are initially having problems sticking with the story, keep going, it gets better!To Ben from Derwood, MD, I'd advise you to remember that this is a work of fiction, that Ms. Kingsolver does not in any way say that all Christian men or all Christian missionaries behaved like Nathan Price. In fact, if you read the book, Price's predecessor did not behave at all like Price (gasp! they must be different people and different people can behave differently!) To say that one work of fiction can categorize and label all members of a religious faith (or any other group) is indeed an insult to the author's intentions and the abilities of readers everywhere to recognize individuals for what they are."
3,A Fight to Stay Awake,"""The Poisonwood Bible,"" is an educational book describing life in the Congo through the eyes of five fictional women. At times you may find yourself dozing off wondering when you will finally reach page 543! The life of a stubborn missionary and his family is not always exciting. You better bake yourself a batch cookies to snack on with a pot of coffee to stay awake. While you are reading about Ruth May's battle with malaria, Leah's hunting escapades, Adah's cynical views of the world, and ignorant Rachel's love affairs be sure to keep taking sips from your coffee mug. All you men out there if you want action this book is not for you, but if you want to know how life in the Congo in 1959 affected people then be prepared to spend hours and hours reading what truly is a Bible!!"
4,wonderful work of ficton,"I though this book was great, the characters were descibed in vivid detail and i got to know all of them quickly. I also think it was interesting how he showed the different point of veiws of each girl in the family. Although some chapters did drag, it was still worth reading to the end, my favorite part was especially the haunting fate of one of the character, which left me shaking after i read it."
5,The Poisonwood Bible,"If you're tired of murder, murder, murder...read this wonderful book full of new thoughts and ideas. I just loved it. I like books where you don't know where its going. A great book."
4,A rich tale,"Barbara Kingsolver's book uses the literary style of having several characters tell the story from each perspective. That is something the reader needs to know at the outset. It was a maddening experience for a hundred pages or so. Then the book fell into a rhythm. This story of the Congo in the 50's and 60's concerns a preacher and his family. Nathan Price uses his minister to cover up guilt from a World War II experience and his wife and four daughters pay the price. The novel is full of African lore, language and ecology. The story itself comes to a climax a little over halfway through. The denouement was long and tedious."
3,"Sorry Barbara, couldn't finish it!","Well l had great expectations after The Bean Trees which I really loved. Unfortunately this story failed to impress me as much.Nathan Price, preacher, drags his wife and four daughters into the Congo to tame the locals. However, nothing prepared him for what his life and his family's would be like there. It's told in 5 different voices, the daughters and his wife's, and it was really interesting to get alternative views from them.But ultimately I didn't get captured by this book or dislike Nathan as intensely as the father in The Mosquito Coast.There are some touching images in this book, the first page of the mother describing the jungle is perfect, as is the 'laying out' of one of her daughters, which is devestatingly heartbreaking. I just felt that the book should've ended after the mother walked away from the home. After that I found it hard to get back into the book and just flicked through from there."
2,This book made me not trust Oprah,"First, I will gladly concede that Ms. Kingsolver is a talented writer. Although a little too bent on man- and Christianity-bashing for my taste (and I am female and barely Christian myself, for the record), I found the first two-thirds of the book an engaging read. It also really made me think, as any good book should. If Ms. Kingsolver had stopped there, I would probably have given the book 4 stars. However, the last third was terrible. The characters behave unbelievably in the context of how they had been portrayed up until that point. The book becomes preachy and one-sided. The man/Christianity bashing gets out of control. I find it infuriating that women feel they have to have ""bad men"" as foils for their ""strong women.""In short, what began as an interesting, thought-provoking, enjoyable read, ended leaving a terrible taste in my mouth."
4,Great literature,"One hundred years from now, if high school students AREN'T reading Barbara Kingsolver in their American Lit classes, I'd be very surprised. This is the stuff of which great literature is made. Up until the last 1/4 - 1/3 of the book, I would have given this book 5 stars and rated it as one of the best books I've ever read.Once in the home stretch, however, the treatment became a little heavy-handed. Up to that point, the book was quite effective in delivering Kingsolver's message.All in all, this remains one of those books that leaves you feeling more enlightened for having read it.Bravo, Barbara Kingsolver!"
3,"Great characters, but too much politics.","I love Kingsolver's novels. She evokes a richness of time, people, and place that is so rare in popular fiction. Poisonwood didn't disappoint in regard to interesting and multi-faceted characters and setting. The women in this story are fascinating in their diversity, and the ways they come to deal with the situations that face them in the Congo. I especially enjoyed the humor that laced their narratives. This story was excellent until the last 100 pages when Kingsolver delved into the politics of the region. While I learned some valuable history lessons, I think novel could have ended much sooner. I hope Kingsolver keeps enlightening us with her outstanding fiction, but I hope she refrains from getting too political in future novels. Her voice is a crucial addition to contemporary women's fiction"
4,Letter to a sister,"You really have to start reading some of the great contemporary novels, which deal with one's childrens' fates, and how they interact with ours, and after a few of them, you start to realize, there are people out there who have been through it, really been through it, just as we are going through it. I suggest Barbara Kingsolver and Iris Murdoch, for instance. At first you think ""WHAT?"" but then you find out, they know what it is to endure marriage and child-raising, and THEY HAVE SEEN IT ALL. It's so important to read. Otherwise we think that we are keeping secrets that must not be revealed, for shame. But believe me, we women in-the-thick-of-it-with-not-much-time-to-read are not alone. There are those who broke through and wrote books for us. We owe it to them to read their books! This is one of those books."
2,tired,"This book was a major disappointment to me. The first hundred pages were slow and hard for me to get into. It got more interesting around the middle but ended horribly with boring, trite, and preachy politics along with a lot of guilt. The historical background on the African Congo was a good history lesson for me, but not enough of a reason to suffer through it. Yawn."
4,Lower the kindle price,"Dear Publishers,I read this book many years ago, greatly enjoyed it. Exceptionally engaging. Emotional.But have since lost my copy. I am now a kindle owner and would love to get it on my device.***WHY do I have to pay a premium price to have a digital copy??? Lower the price to match the new paperback and I'd be more inclined to purchase it.Thanks,Paul"
3,Not quite as advertised,"This is a nice, clean book. It is a 1st edition, but with the end page cut is loses a lot of value. A good reader, but not a collectible."
3,Good book but...,"I do heartily recommend this book. I am un-phased by other reviewers calling this book anti-christian or anti-american. It may be both, but it is well written and is good critique of a lot of bad. I am American and Christian and can handle some criticism when it is thoughtful and well placed. I think this qualifies on both counts.But I would say that Kingsolver becomes less interesting of a writer as she goes a long. The first 4 sections of her book are phenomenal and the charcters interesting. However the last section of her book feels rushed and the charcters feel like they've been flattened out. I liked this book because there was so much color in the charcters. It kept me reading. Towards the end, I kept reading just to finish. The life was gone.But hey...this is my opinion and I can be a little critical. I think it's a good read...so hey go ahead."
3,"good prose, PC pieties","Barbara Kingsolver is a gifted prose writer with an unfortunate penchant for didacticism-- in the service of a multicultural agenda that I generally support, but which I find weakens her artistic achievement. A casual inspection of her work from, say, ANIMAL DREAMS to the present book suggests that she's becoming ever more polemical, ever more like Price in this novel, the fanatical preacher she so despises, only on the opposite end of the political spectrum. This increasing politicization is probably what attracted Oprah's cadre of self-appointed pundits, who, in their well-meaning effort to instruct the masses in literary taste, seem to have forgotten that the greatest literature has always been written in the service of truths far subtler than those black and white ones on which politics has purchase. If Oprah really wants to raise the bar of popular opinion, this is what she needs to lead her audience to see."
4,Kingsolver's worst isn't that bad,"A fan of Barbar Kingsolver, I was on the waiting list at the library before this book even came out. I didn't find it nearly as enjoyable as her previous novels. As a Kingsolver book, it wasn't that good. As a book, however, I found it superior.Readers may have trouble reading Ada's palandrome-laden narratives, or sympathizing with Rachel, the beauty queen. THat was something I wasn't used to. Generally, all of Kingsolvers characters are slightly flawed, but likeable. This was the first book of hers I read where I genuinely disliked some of the characters.Still, it was good, but not up to my expectations."
2,"Long, Slow and Boring","I read this book with my reading group, and after reading all the reviews I am wondering what we missed. Of the 10 in the group only 3 managed to finish. 5 read the first couple of chapters and never went beyond, and the last two quit about half way. I finished the book, but I found it overlong. It was extremely slow moving and frequently boring. I never cared very much about any of the characters with the exception of Adah, and it seemd as if the political agenda of the author frequently overwhelmed the storytelling. Not one I would be inclined to recommend or ever read again."
3,All the preaching nearly spoiled the writing,"There were two preachers in this book, the fictional missionary one and the author. The first part of the book was great, beautifully written and a fascinating account of life in the Congo. However, Kingsolver's agenda eventually murdered the story, turning the characters into cartoons and relentlessly hammering the reader with her message. She should have ended the novel sooner, then gotten her social justice sermon off her chest with an essay."
5,A Ripping Yarn,"This book is excellent! Kingsolver's best. Yes, it does deal with the sticky issue of missionaries and the one in this book is totally off his trolly! Single minded, selfish and stupid, ..., this chap drags his unsuspecting family of all females out into the jungle to erase the culture of the locals and help them abandon their native ways. Turns out bad for the girls, initially, and really bad for the loony dad. Hurrah!!! Yes, you will learn about Africa's fight to get free from the Belgians..What? you say, Belgians ""owned"" the Congo? Yes sirree Bob and a bloody fight it was. But it will do you good to know this and along the way you'll have a thrilling ride. Get this book!"
3,Loved it for a while,"Was figuring on a probable five-star rating here til the last third or so of the novel, which I found incredibly disappointing. Everything I was loving about it--the people of the village, the snakes, the ants--all things wonderfully ""congo-ish""-- abruptly ended after the adorable little girl (whom I also loved) died. It was all down hill from there. How the surviving members of the Price family go on with their lives after their time in the Congo, each in extremely different ways, is interesting stuff, but not as fascinating as living and struggling in the Congo. Added to that, I think the storytelling itself became quite poor. I felt myself becoming more and more distanced from the characters as I got closer and closer to the end. By the end, I didn't really care about them at all. But I loved the first half!"
2,I missed the point,Other people love this book and others say it's slow but stay with it. I got 170 pages in and found I was annoyed at the characters (what did they expect to find in Africa?) and didn't really care anymore about what happened.I know I'm one of the few who didn't like it but I didn't.
3,Ambitious,"Kingsolver leads you into a richly textured collision of 1950's America and the Congo...a dynamic journey until halfway through when the device subtley, but decisively shifts from showing to telling. And what it tells is cynicism, rage, bitterness, sadness. I kept hoping for a glimmer of forgiveness but there was none to speak of. Nathan may have died but his same brand of single-minded blindness lived on in all of his daughters. Some of them just disguised it better."
5,I couldn't put it down.,I loved the way she created such a vivid Africa in this book. I also appreciated the humor and the different perspectives of the narrators. Few people had mentioned Brother Fowles. I thought he and his part in the story were very clever and interesting.
2,Not the best in the world,"This book was definatly interesting to read, but it does not deserve to be in Oprah's Book Club. It's long and drawn out and is kind of a hard read, especially if you have a short attention span, but I do not regret picking it up. I wouldn't highly recommend this book."
1,You need to show more holiday spirit,Happy Festivus. Festivus is for the rest of us. But it is not for you people. You don't deserve this holiday.
4,"Beautiful prose, book could have used some editing","I loved this beautifully written book until soon after the part where the mother and daughters left the father. It should have ended then, because that was obviously the climax of the story. Instead, the book went on unnecessarily for another hundred or so pages with the characters' lives after that climactic event.That said, I found this book to be Kingsolver's best by far. Her device of telling the story through the eyes of different characters was brilliant and made for multilayered portrayals of most of the major characters. Her prose, as I said above, is beautiful: deft, rich, and delicately wrought. Her understanding of the Congo made me feel I was there. Simply one of the best books I have ever read."
2,Gets worse as you go along,"Great start and wonderful character development, but the book becomes tedious about midway through. In the intial stages I loved the parts about how the family was learning and adjusting to life in the Congo. Halfway through after the incident with the youngest child, the book seems to devolve into a laborious mass. The injection of overt political rants really shifts the focus away from the characters and onto the author who is obviously trying to make some statement (although one is never quite sure what her point is). In the end it becomes a chore just to get to the end. Even then, there really is no resolution in the final chapters, the book just comes to a stopping point."
3,Barbara - What happened?,"I am a fan of Kingsolver. However, my mother raved over this book and I was very disappointed. I liked the general topic of the book but the constant character switching was very confusing. The eldest daughter was the only one who was a fully developed character. The last 200 pages were a CHORE to finish. My librarian said that she never could finish the darn book."
1,A grating load of nonsense,"It took all I had to read half way through this book. But I had to finally succumb to boredom and throw it away. It is a very rare occasion when I don't finish a book, out of pure curiosity if nothing else. But I'm glad to be done with this load of annoying nonsense. If you enjoy corny shallow characters,and stories that try so hard to be funny and at the same time political then you'll enjoy this. Otherwise, don't even bother.How this author is so popular, I'll never quite figure out."
1,First and LAST!,"This was my first and last Kingsolver book! As an avid reader, I felt like I'd wasted a lot of quality reading time with this one. It was boring and so very depressing! Also regret spending money for such a disappointing book!"
1,"Trite, predictable little parable from Berkeley","Oh, the evils of white Christian men! This radical-chic screed leaves no cliché unturned--Phil Donahue could have written it if Marlo had given him permission. Couldn't finish it, but why bother? It was clear from the first page that this would be an object lesson in all the bad things about people Kingsolver fears and despises. Oh, bad bad man. Poor victimized women and noble Africans. Trés boring."
3,e-book needs an edit,I loved this book BUT the number of typos and '?' that appear in the text of the Kindle version was frustrating. The e-book needs an edit!
2,"Great book, but don't buy this paperback","I read this book before and wanted to buy it. This paperback edition, with a flimsy cover and deckle edge pages feels awful in my hands. Great book, but don't buy this edition."
3,Leah is nauseating,"I thought this was an OK book. I did like reading about the Congo and its history. However, I found the characters to be just *too* one-dimensional. I think the author could have done so much more w/the eldest sister, Rachel -- it's like she stayed 17 forever - as if she'd have the same views as a 40 year-old that she did as a teenager. Also, although Leah, the heroine, had good and appropriate cause to be disapproving and judgmental, I found her to be completely nauseating nonetheless. Adah seemed to be the only character that grew, and therefore was my fav."
1,One of the worst books I ever read,"This book was horrible! I felt like I was being preached at the entire time. I was disappointed in all of the character's personalities because they were so dull and they never stood up for themselves. I was so put off by this book that I dreaded reading it, but I kept at it because everyone said it was good. I also had read other books by the author and loved those, but I found that this one did not measure up at all. I couldn't believe that someone would publish a book so incredibally awful"
5,Absolutely Enthralling,"I was reluctant to pick up this book when it first came out because it had the word Bible in the title, but was finally convinced when I started work at the Museum of Natural History on a scientific expedition to the Congo that took place in 1910. The book helped me realize what Africa must have been during the days when it was known as ""the Dark Continent"" Unfortunately, the book threw me off with several important factual errors, such as the date of discovery of the okapi, with which it starts. The narrative quickly drew me back in and I found myself unable to put it down."
2,Authorial Intrusion,"The female characters were beautifully evoked and I felt engaged by them. However, the author's insistence on incorporating her personal agenda became overwhelmingly irritating and eventually threw me out of the novel."
3,It was an OK book,"To tell you the truth, i didn't like this book very much at all! Everyone had been talkign about how good it was, but when i FINALLY got involved in the story and could manage to keep the characters in order it wasn't that exciting. It was neat to see the different points of views from the characters, but it took you a while to find out what their perspective was on everything, and then go back to the story to put the pieces together. When you do finally get involved it isn't that bad of a book, and in the end whne they tell you what the daughters are doing when they are fully grown, it is funny to see how they have changed. The plot has a lot of twists that keep you involved, but you NEED to be constantly reading the book to get everything straight! The main plot was a good idea if it didn't always go into a million different directions!"
3,the middle is meaty,"Kigsolver is very eloquent in her endeavor to capture the audience with beautiful prose. She tempts you to continue reading. The first 150 pages of this novel were somewhat boring. The last 150 pages of this novel were also somewhat boring. If you can get passed the opening then you can really sink your teeth the real plot, which is getting this group of women through their demented fathers attempt to make everyone else suffer for some slight he feels he committed almost 20 years beforehand. I enjoyed the book overall, but next time I'll read the condensed version!"
3,disappointed,"The first two-thirds of this book is beautifully written. I love the way Kingsolver created unique voices for each of the characters and told the story through their eyes. However, the book takes a disappointing turn during the last third. Rachel's character turns into a parody of herself, and Leah's self-righteous and predictably PC diatribe becomes tiresome at best. It struck me that Kingsolver was projecting a fantasy of middle-class, baby-boomer-style radicalization onto both Leah and Orleanna. Toward the end of the book, Leah's voice started sounding like the author was preaching at the reader about first world imperialism in Africa--not that she doesn't have a good point, but preaching about politics is a great way to ruin a novel."
2,Moderately interesting first half but way too long,"Even the moderately interesting first half was way too long and repetitive; the author essentially told you in the first chapter what was going to happen, so it was just a question of how it was going to get there. It got there slowly.I was going to say it had the longest denouement I have ever read, but online reviewer ""Ellen"" expressed it better: ""page upon page of endless bla bla bla-ing"""
1,A Big Disappointment,"I really really tried to like this novel. Barbara Kingsolver is one of my favorite authors and I've relished all of her previous writing. But this book was dreary in the extreme. I tried to force myself to read it but finally rebelled after about l00 pages. The family endures relentless pain, suffering, and misery. I don't mind heavy books (like ""Animal Dreams"") but I don't submit myself to books about endless misery with no joy or hope. For a life-affirming book, try ""The Color of Water,"" a serious book but one that inspires and uplifts, rather than this dark and depressing tale."
3,Stereotyping christians,"While I found this book to be intriguing because of the setting, I also found it extremely disappointing in the picture it portrays of christians in the mission field. My pastor is head of the Foreign Mission Board for the Eastern Hemisphere and we always have missionaries visiting our church. They are always people who care about their families immensely and are answering a difficult call from the Lord. I have never met one that fit this horrid description of a man led by the Lord to evangelize others in foreign territory. While the character in the story had some life trauma's apparently causing him to become this unlikely zealot, it is very disturbing to cast this glow on people in the mission field. I am sorry I wasted the time to expect this book to improve. Oprah continues to choose literature that does not strengthen the body of Christ.In Georgia"
2,Could not get into it.,This book had some promise. It could have been good but I did not feel part of the story. The author was just telling the reader what happened. I like to know what the characters are experiencing inside as well as out. I lost interest in the first quarter of the book. I gave more than one star because the premise was good and the characters at least potentially were interesting.
2,An ambitious book which boggs down into preaching politics.,"I think that Barbara Kingsolver must sit down and decide whether she is writing a novel or a political tract. It is not that I disagree in a fundamental way with her political beliefs. My problem is that she has them on her sleeve, or at least her character's sleeve, to such an extent that character development is truncated. Most of my friends do not agree with my politics. If either they or I were defined by our set of political beliefs, I would have no friends, and I have a good many close ones. Barbara Kingsolver is a gifted writer who starts with a good idea and creates believable characters and plots, but all too often gets bogged down in preaching at the reader through her characters. Certainly, Animal Dreams suffered from this and The Poisonwood Bible is all but sunk by it. Telling a story through five different childhood voices is a monumental task--perhaps really impossible--and I congratulate the author for trying at all."
4,Evangelist Psycho,"The story is told throught the eyes of 4 women: a mother, and her three daughters. The book is not just a great read, but also a hystorical and geographical lesson that you will appreciate learning. Within the story, there is hate, greed, and love (the odd kind). The major flaw, in my opinion, is the way the story is concluded because it makes the story ""seem"" a little more ""fictional"" (I'm not exactly sure how to put it), yet the rest of the story seemed very captivating as if it were a true story, and everything could possibly have happened. The ending seemed to just kill the tone of the whole thing."
3,Cultural differences,"What was it like in the Congo in 1960? Barbara Kingsolver's novel of a missionary family gives the reader an idea. The family consisting of the Reverend, his wife and 5 daughters go to the Congo without sanction by his church in order to bring religion to the natives. The difference in cultures is stunning, and something that people who have never thought about going to Africa may never have thought of. The story is built around real events during the Congo revolution for independence. The writing is wonderful - each of the daughters has a section describing the events that were occuring in that era, and each daughter writes very distinctively and around the age group that you would expect.I didn't hate this book, but it isn't one of my favorites. It has, however, peaked my interest about what happend in the Congo in the 60's and before. This has led me to order several other books on the Congo."
5,Akin to Faulkner's *The Sound and the Fury*,"This compelling and brilliant work by the gifted Barbara Kingsolver stands stylistically alongside Faulkner's *The Sound and the Fury.* Told from the separate viewpoints of a mother and her four daughters who follow their missionary husband/father to the Congo, the story unfolds with slow suspense, like a flower that can't quite catch a coy sun on a variably cloudy day. It is alternately and simultaneously a tale of self-destruction, coping, the death of innocents and devils, and redemption. Kingsolver is a master storyteller with the power to rivet attention so completely that while you are reading her, airplane turbulence, the need for sleep, and even a lover's touch can go unnoticed."
4,Poisonwood Bible Review,"Overall, I thought that the Poisonwood Bible had a great plot, although I thought that the beginning was slow. It would have been nice to have a background on the Price family living in the US. It also would have been nice to see their reactions to their father's demands. I thought that each character in the book was excellently portrayed. No character was the same as another, and their emotions and feelings were obvious and realistic. I enjoyed the author's writing style. Although, sometimes it was boring, especially in the beginning. Sometimes she was too descriptive, and other times, she was not descriptive enough."
5,Compelling and overwhelming,"I can't imagine a better discription of the life of a missionary family. This would never take place today, the women of today have gotten educated, and therefore more able to express what they want. This is a tremendous book! Highly recommend it to any age group."
3,"Five stars for writing, only 3 for story telling","Kingsolver is marvelous narrativist. She writes with humor. She does well inside the heads of her four female characters. Maybe she knows wherein her talents lie and where they fail. She had a marvelous tragic hero here, but she only painted him from the view of his childish daughters. Even more from inside the wife's head would have given us a better aspect of the story she only hints at. All her male characters are pretty plastic. Would that we had a really great story about the impact of this misguided missionary on the cultures he seeks to impose his Jesusite politics on. As it is, it's like seeing the story through the wrong end of the telescope."
5,Poisonwood Review,This book is an excellent read. The imagery is fantastic. I felt as though I was in the Congo with the Price family as I was reading this book. Barbara Kingsolver also did a lot of reasearch on the history of the Congo.
2,Poisonwood Bible,"I had an incredibly hard time getting into this book. The beginning was slow, but it began to pick up through the middle. The middle was full of excitement and for about 100 pages I found it hard to put down. But toward the end I found it hard to finish. The excitement was over and it was back to dull. I believe the book could have been shortened from 600 pages to about 300 and it would have been better."
2,Ms. Kingsolver should have done her homework,"As I read this book, I felt swept away in a different era of which I was totally blind. However, when Ms. Kingsolver began to trash the Baptists, I held a different view. First of all, Southern Baptists do not believe in infant baptism. A person has to know Christ in a personal way and make a commitment to be saved and turn from their sins - baptism is an outward gesture to the world that you have faith in Christ and are willing to make a commitment to follow Christ. Ms. Kingsolver clearly has no clue on the Southern Baptist faith. She should have done her homework!!! If she is so totally wrong on the issue of Baptist religion - One can only determine that she may not have done her homework on the political issues either!!"
5,Top 10 books in my life!,"Femicinstic, political, deep, family values, religion...Required reading in the school of my child.I started reading it, just to keep in touchwith the culture treasure of my child, but very soon I realized that I am reading one of my life's top 10 books.I recommend it to all my friends.I keep it on the same shelf with Bean Trees by BK,and ""Handmaid's tale"" by MA."
4,The Poisonwood Bible,"The thought of having to read a 550 page book for my required summer reading, along with a second choice, didn't leave me in a good mood. However, I have survived the Poisonwood Bible. Although, the first 100 pages or so were a bit boring, they were necessary to the development of the characters. If I hadn't been forced to read this book for school, I may have picked it up eventually because I tend to read Oprah Book Club books. The development of the 5 women is magnificent. I especially enjoyed Adah's point of view during the run from the ants. Her struggle to save her own life, after her own mother turns her back is something I'll always recall. I think many different people can find something to relate to in this book. It's a good read."
5,Remarkable work,"This is a stupendous piece of work by Ms. Kingsolver. The way she has built up the story through the eyes of all the characters is simply great. You'll love to read the same incident narrated by different people in different manners so genuinely. This is so close to what we experience in daily life. The things which we hate in someone is not at all bad if you see from his/her angle. This book is in no way behind my favorite book ""Roots"" by Alex Haley. Keep it up Ms Kingsolver, we expect a repeatition of such work."
2,Let down,"After hearty recommendations, I found this book to be bogged down with personal agenda. There were interesting moments, compelling words ... but the author's apparent disdain for things American (including white men, capitalism and Christians), kept peeking through the story, distracting me. I'm discouraged that so many reviewers take her ""facts"" as truth. After Ruth May's death, the book took on a feeling of socialist propaganda. I totally lost interest."
5,Fantastic read!,One of the best novels I've read in a while. You'll find yourself thinking about it long after you've finished it.
4,Draining. Worth Your Time.,"The novel raises important questions about the role of missionaries and the clash of cultures that results when progress, fueled by religious fanaticism, collides with poverty and thousands of years of survival on instinct. The daughters' characters breathe. The visual imagery is stunning. Read this."
4,Just read the WORDS,"I enjoyed this book more for the language than the story. Not to say the tale wasn't interesting, and for me, knowing little of the Congolese history, it was gripping. But other things were even more interesting. I was really fascinated by Kingsolver's picture of what it was like inside Adah's head (daeh's hada!)and her unique use of language. The different voices maintained my interest in the story throughout, and unlike many others who've reviewed the book I found the characters quite realistic and convincing. The one character I felt was less than sufficiently deep was the mother. I wanted to sympathize with her, but found her too insipid to get involved with. Nevertheless, a jolly good read, and educational too. (Political freaks take note, this is a novel, not a textbook. Literary freaks take note, this is a popular novel, not a pivotal literary masterpiece.)"
3,Longer is not necessarily better.,"In ""The Poisonwood Bible,"" Kingsolver's use of separate and distinct personae as the tellers of the tale is very effective, particularly Adah's wonderfully slanted inner takes on the realities and her many palindromes. As is always the case with Kingsolver, the mothers, daughters, sis-siblings, and assorted other femmes are wonderfully portrayed as are their interactions; the men are flat, foolish, and primarily incidental. Otherwise, I thought Kingsolver's transitions between her narrative fictional elements and the historical facts she researched and/or gleaned from other sources were a bit forced. It's an interesting time and take, but for me her shorter tales are better. And, as for ""feeling"" the reality of post-colonial Africa, I think Hemingway's ""True at First Light"" is vastly superior to this effort by Ms. Kingsolver."
5,Absolutely Stunning.,"This is Barbara Kingsolving's best book to date; I found it to be one of the best books I have read this year. I strongly disagree with the reviewer who found Rachel's malaprop-laden sections ""tedious and annoying. I thought they provided comic relief from the telling of the tragic and bloody history of the Congo."
3,A great story bogged down by an unending denouement.,"For the first 300 pages, this is a great book that thoroughly engages you in another world. While the plot and characters are all well done, the highlight of this book is the author's wonderful depicition of the Congo. Not only does she do a wonderful job of evoking the setting, but she also skillfully interweaves the historical and political background of the region. This will be a welcome discovery for most readers. Unfortunately, my enjoyment of the first two thirds of the book was tempered by the incredibly long resolution. Without spoinling it for new readers, there is a definite point where the primary plot is resolved. The rest of the book felt like one big afterword to me. Yes, I had become invested in the lives of the primary characters, and it was nice to find out what happened to them. However, the tension and drama of the original storyline was gone."
4,Wonderful Read,I enjoyed this book until the very end. I found the wrap up of all the girl's lives too quick and neat. It certainly gives a good history lesson on the Congo in the fifties.
4,"I'm not an Oprah Book fan, but I really liked this one!","I've read several of the Oprah selections and only liked two of them, so I was leery of giving another one a try. I'd heard some feedback previously to The Poisonwood Bible and had wanted to read it anyway, so I used that as an excuse to pick this one up. I really enjoyed it--so much, that I read it in less than a week. I was extremely interested in the historical aspect since these things were happening while I was a child unaware. The ending was slow and much too long after the climax, so expect the final chapters to be a drugery. Other than that, it's a good read and well worth the time."
3,Knowing when to stop,"Barbara Kingsolver's The Poisonwood Bible is a delicious read up to a point, and then she kept going. Her plot climaxed just past the middle of the book (and a brilliant, well written climax it is, no doubt) but the remaining chapters were superfluous sequel fodder. The characters became like old clothes: just plain worn out and full of holes. Where an epilogue would do, she wrote another book..."
3,Poisonwood Bible,"The story reminded me of the book of Job. Near the end of the story the pastor is portrayed as a really awful man. He is authoritarian, traditional, and religious, but I didn't think of him as a bad person."
4,Brilliant,"This goes into my library as one of my favs simply because I felt I hadn't ever read anything like it...which is saying something. I loved the way the story is told from different persepctives. The only reason I don't give this book 5 starts is because I felt the last 100 pages are so were slow. Otherwise, great!"
3,First two-thirds are good.,"Overall this is a good book. However, after the death of one of Orleanna's children, the story gets tedious, repeating the same points over and over again about the situation in the Congo. Could have been a great book."
3,Stop halfway through.,"When I started The Poisonwood Bible, all I could think about was how impressed I was. Kingsolver's description is excellent, and the sense of gloom, threat, and bewilderment-- spiritually, politically, and physically-- made me deeply thankful I live on this continent. She manages to cycle through the viewpoints of the family's women without confusing the reader, and although the childs-eye views grate at times, the gears shift fast enough, and the story is good enough, that they doesn't present a major obstacle.The real problem comes late in the book, when Kingsolver goes all political. Perhaps if I too were furious about the state of affairs in the Belgian Congo, it wouldn't be such a big deal, but it really spoiled the book for me.Make no mistake-- there are many good things about The Poisonwood Bible (including some I haven't mentioned at all), and the early part is a real show of power. But the polemical, political ranting toward the end puts a millstone around its neck."
2,a hole at the center,"With all the fancy stylistic posturing to which Kingsolver resorts to tell this story, she denies a voice to what should be the most interesting of her characters: the father who brought them to Africa. Without any intimate knowledge of him and his motives, we have to take them for granted, which is smug. Are we deprived of him because he's a man (arbitrary) or because of a complete failure of imagination at the heart of the structure?I think this is why the book is much too long and self-indulgently ""cute"" - Joseph Conrad's tight construction would have been a better model."
3,"good, but the political correctness was annoying","An otherwise excellent story was ruined about 100 pages from the end, when things digressed into a whiny politically correct diatribe about how all of Zaire's problems are due to the U.S. backing Mobutu when he first came to power. The political subplots would have been fine, though, if Kingsolver's characters hadn't been so disgustingly sanctimonious. It made the book really unpleasant to finish."
3,Thoughts our of Africa,"Barbara Kingsolver's ""The Poisonwood Bible' arrived on my doorstep in South Africa in June 1999 - a gift from a dear friend in Boston MA. Like many in 'the West' she is very interested to learn more about Africa. She loved the book, and knew I would too. We laughed, wept and had our eyes opened in many different ways. Africa, with it's many places and peope, is not somwhere one can learn about on TV - or read about in history or travel books. However, Barbara Kingsolver - 'cheered on' by South Africa's own Kate Turkington, has done a wonderful job of putting us - even those of us here in the South - in the picture. A wonderful read for a few chilly July evenings."
1,Flat and That's That,"This book was a birthday gift from my son so even though I wanted to quit reading it so many times, I trudged on to the end. I kept hoping that it would get better but it never did. I found myself confessing to my husband that I'd be so happy when I was finished reading this book. My main complaint is that I never really connected with any of the characters. Plus, there was the element of being ""preached"" to by the author, which was both irritating and tiresome. I do not enjoy being coerced by an author to feel a particular way. There's no need for that. I believe if a story is told authentically, without an agenda, then it can be appreciated no matter which side the reader comes down on the substance of the story.I really wanted to like this book but I just found it lacking."
3,Dishonest?,"Of course it is a wonderful novel, and beautifully written. But it is not a disinterested study of the history of the Congo, and ought not to pretend that it is. Why, in the bibliography is there no reference to any Congo missionary or missionary organisation since the 19th century? There was plenty of real evangelical work going on but she hasn't used it, or researched it. Is this because she was worried it would not have fitted in exactly with the interpretation of events and attitudes that she is pushing? First hand direct descriptions such as those of Dr.Helen Roseveare would surely have not been hard to find and are not fiction. Why did she ignore accounts of evangelical religion there and then from the inside? It leaves me uneasy."
4,Spell binding fictional history,"Barbara Kingsolver captured my heart as we see the Congo of the late 50's through the eyes of a zealously neurotic, (psychotic?) missionary's four female children and his wife. The Price family arrives to find political unrest and a tribal culture that captivates and hones the heart and soul leaving all of them bewildered, embattled, and scarred, tearing the foreign family structure to the ground. It makes one realize the strength of our cultures."
3,The Poisonwood Bible,"Barbara needs to do more research on Baptist missionaries, even in the fifties Southern Baptist took care of their missionaries and would not have left them stranded. Patrice Lumumba died after 1960 and Eisenhower was not president. She is using her personal political views to get her message across. I don't know if I will read another of her books. Her book did make me more interested in African history."
5,The best book I've read in years,"This book surpassed my expectations, which were high from the subject and the author. Barbara Kingsolver not only paints a family with the brushes of 5 distinct voices but also portrays a complex political history in personal terms. I was swept away by the writing, the emotion, and the compassion for a very distant and different culture that The Poisonwood Bible pulls together in a seamless whole. An excellent book that I began recommending to others before I'd even finished it."
5,A must read!,"I am not drawn to books about Africa or religion, but this was recommended by a friend and turned out to be the best book I've read in years. It is so philosophical and well-woven that it effortlessly guides the reader through a number of years and changes while provoking one to consider some of life's biggest mysteries: What is God? What is His intent for mankind? What is sin? What is worth? And yet the storytelling is so spellbinding that you read every word to eek out the meaning(s).This book changed my life."
5,Wonderful Story. Great Characters.,"I loved this book. Once I started it I couldn't put it down until I was done.I laughed out loud at Rachel and her ""command"" of the English language.I cried with Orleanna and her depression.I empathized with the twins Adah and Leah.My heart broke for Ruth May.I sobbed at the ending, and wished there were more.I loved how the characters were so much alike, but at the same time so very different. Reading each of their perpectives was a really unique way of writing the story, and I enjoyed it immensley.The history lesson of the independence of the Congo was wonderful and I felt very factful. I've read other books on the Congo, and found this one to be very accurate."
4,Interesting,"I found this to be well-written and thought provoking. Having been to Africa, I connected with Barbara Kingsolver's storyline.Editor of Michele Cozzens' award winning women's fiction A Line Between Friends"
4,Barbara Kingsolver knows how to touch my heart!!!,"First off, I would like to tell everyone that Barbara Kingsolver changed my life with this book. Her book The Poisonwood Bible, is like a bible to me. I was once a beggar on the streets of Chicago, when a kind man let me read this book. From that day forward I have been a changed man. This compelling story has touched my soul in a way nothing else has ever been able to do. It is a heartwarming novel that should be read by everyone in Chicago - especially you!"
5,I loved it!,"I'll admit, I did not really expect to enjoy this book, but much to my surprise I loved it! I enjoyed hearing the girls different interpretations of what they were experiencing. I think it gave me a better understanding of what was really happening. I also find this book really interesting because not only is it a story of an American family trying to survive in the Congo, but it also describes the politics that were governing the Congo. I think that by the end of the book I had a better understanding of how some places are intrinsically different. Neither the government nor the religion of the USA is necessarily the best solution for other countries, even if it works great in the US. The geographical and climatic differences make it impossible for their cultures to ever be similar. Overall, this book was wonderfully crafted to show life in the Congo."
4,"Captivating, inspiring, and poetic.","This was my first Kingsolver novel - and I have to say, if you've never read her books before this is a good one to start with. I didn't think I'd like this book, and yet it became one of my favorites!The changing points of view are refreshing, the characters are so very real, and the writing is beautiful. The political lesson is fine by me - in fact, right after I finished this book the movie ""Lumumba"" premiered on HBO. However, the politics aren't until the very end - when you're already involved with the characters - so they fit in the flow.I kept shaking my head and rolling my eyes at the arrogance, even ignorance, of Rev. Price in the beginning. The story could have taken place here - Guam was ruled by Spanish missionaries for three hundred years, until the Spanish American War. Being anti-missionary is in my blood - so the story of this family and their ultimate failure to tame Africa is especially meaningful to me."
2,gab gab gab,"I read the book cover to cover waiting for it to get off the ground. Barbara has some worthwhile things to say on philosophy, politics, religion, economics, and culture. Unfortunately, she rambles on and on in first person accounts from four females. She could accomplish her literary objectives with half as many words."
3,Too long and overblown,"I found the first half of ""Poisonwood Bible"" absorbing. For a zealous husband to lead his wife and family into a totally different culture and to be so ill equipped and unprepared was absorbing. All 4 daughters were 3 dimensional as well as the mother. It would have been nice to hear what went on inside Nathan's head as well. But I really couldn't sympathize with any of the sisters. They were all so different: running from the total devotion Leah had towards her father to Rachel's selfishness and Ada's cynicism. A large portion of the novel is dedicated to Kingsolver's personal political views of the Belgian Congo."
1,Unrealistic and historically inaccurate,"This book contains so many historical inaccuracies and untruths that it is barely tolerable reading. The author continually exploits cliches of race whether they apply or not just to manipulate the reader's emotions. Leave this book at home, and read ""AFRICA"", the true history is so much better than this weak fabrication."
3,Could Have Been Better...and Shorter,"While I don't mind reading a 600+ page novel if the story is worthy of 600+ pages, I do mind reading a book that long without the story necessary to justify it's length.This novel takes a long time to get going, climaxes about 2/3 way through the book, and then leaves you with 200 more pages to read after the story is basically over. Additionally, the character development is horribly uneven. Kingsolver does a great job of dispelling the stereotypes of Africans, and yet, Nathan and Rachel are nothing more than the stereotypical militant preacher and dumb blonde, respectively.On the plus side, this novel has some great social commentary and relays a history of political events that most Americans know little about. Many of the characters are well developed and the story line is engaging in many areas.Overall, I don't horribly regret reading this novel, but in retrospect I probably would have picked something else."
5,This has become one of my top ten favorite books.,"This was one of the best novels I have read in the last ten years. It is the story of a family that moves to Africa to be missionaries. Each chapter is told throught the eyes of a different member of the family (the mother and four daughters). Ms. Kingsolver is an excellent storyteller, very clever and witty. I can't wait to read more of her books."
4,Gripping,"This is one great book. Barbara Kinsolver has done it again! This is a story of a family of a mother and her three daughters and their religious crazed father. The father picks up his family and makes them move to Africa so that he can preach and ""save"" the people from burning in hell. It is a wonderful story of how a city family adapts to the jungles in Congo. It is very suspensfull and at at the same time very heart warming. It is very emotional to follow the relationship between the daughters and their mother. The narration and description are wonderful. I actually felt I was in the jungle - it is that intense! Great book - a definite MUST READ."
1,Don't Buy the AUDIOBOOK version (The book itself is great),"I have loved this book ever since I read it when it was first published. It is a fabulously written and engrossing story. A haunting tale of a family and a country that lingers with the reader long after you're done reading. It is one of the books on my keeper shelf, and one I buy for others as gifts. It has also become one of my comfort reads, a book I reach for when nothing else captures my mind enough to escape from the everyday pressures of life. With that said, I bought the audiobook version (unabridged on CD) for a long car trip. Big mistake. DON'T GET THE AUDIOBOOK version! It is horribly read by Dean Robertson (fyi, a female, not a male). There is absolutely no inflection to the voice, no feeling, and the pace is completely wrong for the story. Very rushed and hurried from the start. There is no change when switching from one character to another. Don't waste your money on the audiobook. Buy the paperback version!"
1,Politically Correct Kingsolver,"If you want to be preached to by our culture read ""poisonwood"". Kingsolver does us a disservice by feeding us the usual politically correct bull. She unashamedly promotes her agenda that is in lock step with the general culture of our land. Anti-Christian and anti-life. I knew it was coming but I had to wait till about page 500 before she outright promoted contraception as a possible end to African troubles. She, of course, didn't make me wade into the book any length before she showed her hostility to Christianity. Her intellectual smugness was too much for me to take throughout the book but I perservered not liking a book to defeat me. I closed it five pages before the end in protest."
3,I agree,"Kingsolver is a very talented, very engaging story teller. I was throughly engaged with the Price family. But Kingsolver is also just another self-loathing white liberal. She alone as the writer reduces her story from an impressive work of art to just another banal lecture on how we as westerners should feel ashamed.Read it if you want to. I enjoyed the Prodigal Summer which is why I wanted to also read the Poisonwood Bible. However after reading Poisonwood I think I might be off Kingsolver indefinately."
2,started off good...had to force myself to finish it,"I found this book really interesting at first because of the historical context and the idea of writing a book from four different perspectives, but rather than adding objectivity, all four characters only serve to reinforce anti-American, anti-Christian sentiments. She creates unlikeable characters that you don't even love to hate. I found myself relating most to Leah, having been to a third world country and having struggled through the culture shock of returning to the U.S., but the more I read her voice, the more self-righteous she sounded. The saddest part was that there was absolutely no sense of cohesian in the family from the very beginning, nothing that bound them together, and no remorse for the father's fate. But reading this book did get me interested in learning more about the historical context and finding out how true the allegations are against the Eisenhower administration."
5,One of the best books I've ever read...,"Kingsolver's themes and characters are so complex that the book literally takes you to a completely different level of critical reading. Her imagery of Afica's unpredictable terrain is simply beautiful. In addition, the story progresses in a way that just hooks and astounds you until you reach the last page. I highly recommend this amazing novel!"
4,Warning -- SPOILERS!,"I greatly enjoyed the first half of this book. So much so that I give the entire book 4 out of 5 stars. I loved the structure Kingsolver used, and I was especially pleased by how Ruth May ends the novel. I was riveted by this family of Christian Missionaries in the Congo in the 60s. I thought it was truthful and accurate -- the language barriers, the way the village reacts to them, the diseases, the animals, etc -- but the book somewhat lost my interest after Ruth May is bit by the snake and the sisters head in different directions. I found the character of Leah to be extremely annoying. My favorite was Adah -- I loved the palindromes and poetry. But the Leah chapters (in the second half) were like reading an encyclopedia. I could have learned about the political strife in Zaire from reading a text book. Still, this book was better than a lot of stuff I have read."
3,"Well-written, exciting story--but real thing is better","Kingsolver's ""The Poisonwood Bible"" is a gripping, well-written novel. The perspectives of the different characters at varying ages add tremendous depth to the story (though I did find the character of Rachel too consistently shallow to be believable). However, I could not help but be saddened throughout the book by the superficial and fairly ignorant treatment of the heart and motive of true Christian missionary work. From the bibliography, it appears that the author did a fine job of researching the history, geography, and people of Africa, but skimmed over the book's all-too-peripheral subject of Christianity. Real-life missionary stories (Elisabeth Elliot's ""Through Gates of Splendor"" and Bruce Olson's ""Bruchko,"" to name a few) are packed with more emotion, more action, more tragedy, and ultimately, more hope than Kingsolver could ever dream up."
4,Worth the time to read-,"While this book was a hard starter,(it took nearly 140 pages until I seriously cared what came next) I have to say it is definitely worth it. The story of a missionary family going to the Congo during a turbulent period in history was extremely interesting. One of the fascinating aspects to the whole story is that it makes you look at ""wants and needs"" in life with a completely different perspective from each character in the novel, and then in one's own life. It takes you into the lives of the native Congolese people in a small village,their everyday needs and how they view the missionary families. Each of the characters has such a different perspective on what is going on, it is like piecing a puzzle together, and ending up with a picture that wasn't like the one on the box. Very interesting,very compelling. Not a quick read obviously, but very well worth your time."
2,Can't get hooked,I am only on page 40 of this book--but it's taken a week just to read that. I just can't seem to get into the story. I've read several books that keep me going and I'll stay up all night trying to read as much as possible. Maybe I prefer more suspenseful and action filled books. So far Poisonwood has been a yawn!! I guess I give it a chance --it did have good reviews.
2,Best reading ever,Poisenwood Bible is a must read for everyone. I hope it has been translated into every written language and that it becomes required reading in every institute of higher education.
5,Wow!,"I walked into this novel thinking that it would be an utter waste of my time, since I had to read it for summer AP English work. Having finished it, I've realized that I was completly wrong. This book was amazing! So many words of praise come to mind when I think of this novel. It placed me in the center of a bitter-sweet experience that not only affects the lives of the characters but also that of the reader. The Poisonwood Bible was touching in every sense of the word and it was definitely worth the hours I put into reading it. Kingsolver's characters were believeable and extremely well-developed. The plot was unique and intriguing and I found it virtually impossible to put down. The beauty and majesty of this novel are hard for me to express, after having found myself drowning in such words and such a story. I am exceedingly pleased that Oprah has placed it on her Book Club list for June and I would whole-heartedly recommend it to anyone. Enjoy this mesmerizingly wondeful experience!"
5,Going deep in the Congo,"Barabra Kingsolver is one of the best novelists writing today. With the Poisonwood Bible, she has surpassed even her own high standards. It is a journey into daily life in the Congo of the mid-twentieth century and onward, a journey that we should all take. I appreciate the depth to which she explores the characters, even with the most challenging of persons and circumstances. I learned through this book about an Africa I never knew, and it changed my life."
5,Wonderful to read and even better to listen!,"I read this wonderful book as soon as it came out and thought it was fabulous. My husband had not read it and we purchased the unabridged ""books on tape"" for our road trip to Yosemite! What a brilliant idea it was! We were captivated by the language and appreciate the beauty of the parables and analgoies. I HIGHLY recommend the audio version of this great book!"
4,wonderfully descriptive and full of adventures,I could not put down this book at all! I loved every minute of it. The contrasting accounts given by the main characters in the book hold your attention. I have recommended it to all of my friends and co-workers.
5,best novel ive read in ages,"Fantastic story line, dynamic characters, and life issues we all deal with. Great depiction of the human condition, including the intricacies of family, convictions, and faith. All in highly readable prose that draws you in and makes you hunger for more."
5,Exquisite writing but a bit dark,"This book was written so wonderfully. The characters are realistic and you can't help but get attached to them. The book is very realistic, albeit a bit dark and moody. Still, the progression of the character's through their lives and their associated journeys is amazing. I enjoyed this book immensely."
5,Kingsolver is brilliant,"The Poisonwood Bible is beautifully written and uniquely so. The vantage points of five strong females fuels a story about guilt, religiosity, spirituality, innocence, cultural differences, and forgiveness. I am in awe of Kingsolver's interpretation of Adah and Orleanna in particular - the beauty of these passages is unparalleled in modern literature. I was moved, inspired, self-reflective and encouraged as a result of reading this book. It will be a cherished addition to my personal favorites and I encourage any and all to read it."
2,Beautiful writing Marred by One-Note Characterizations,"How could Kingsolver have ruined her book with such an obvious error? Nathan is a strident paper doll that flattens the whole story. Just as bad, the author has all the narrators using the same ironic tone to describe him, deadening their voices as well. At the same time, Kingsolver doesn't have the guts to show him doing something trully terrible. I don't trust an author who can't let the reader make up his own mind, and as a consequence I couldn't trust her views about ANYTHING in the story. I'm giving this two stars for her descriptions of the African landscape, and that is all."
2,The bible according to Jesus,"I thought this book was interesting. it was really really really long, but it was also very good. I liked the way it was written through many peoples eyes and how each character was made so dynamic through their actions and personalities. I thought this book was a good read if you have a lot of time on your hands."
3,One woman's view,"A fine book. This is one woman's view told through 5 different voices. Certainly some witty and creative writing. However, I found that it became too preachy by the end. The author over-explains the lesson that she wants you to learn. As a result, I'm not anxious to read another of her novels."
4,75% great,"The first three-quarters of this book were truly outstanding.The author skilfully conveyed the different characters within the family and I really felt sympathetic towards their problems.Throughout there were beautiful descriptions of Congo.The problem I had with the book was that after the family's exodus the author goes on to describe what happened to each person during the next 30 years or so.I think this is unnecessary and I would have preferred to have imagined the family's future.The exodus itself was so dramatic and moving that it would be a perfect ending.This aside,I recommend you read this-the characters will stay in your mind for a long time."
3,not her best,"I was disappointed in this book. Barbara Kingsolver's other novels are some of my favorites, and I was disappointed that this didn't meet up to her regular standards. True, it was a very different type of book than her others. I hope she can return to her past successful style while still incorporating her new ideas and visions."
5,Can't Put it Down!,"I eat, sleep and dream this book. Each chapter reveals new thoughts and insights of the characters in a way that makes them a part of your life. Its definitely one of the best stories I've read in months. Read it!"
3,Credible characters,"I read this book on flights to and from Europe and throughout my visit there, so my reading was more disjointed than usual. I found it difficult eventually to follow the Congo politics, which may have been due to sleep deprivation and my own sensory overload. I did enjoy the characterization of the zealot Baptist father - surely there is no more fervent advocate of the way things should be done than a Baptist missionary - and his long-suffering family with their myriad perceptions of the Congo. I was particularly touched by Leah, the idealist, whose belief in her father dissolved with agonizing insights into his true character. Kingsolver did an excellent job of allowing us to understand how these parents evolved into the people they became. The entire family's naivete about the father's ""mission"" and their evolving part in African life had far-reaching consequences that are well portrayed."
5,Breathtaking,"From the moment I opened this book, I could not set it down. This was a fascinating story that made me feel like I was really there experiencing everything that happened right along with them. I highly recommend this novel to anyone...I hope that you loved it as much as I did!"
5,Best Barbara Kingsolver,"I loved the Poisonwood Bible. My favorite Barbara Kingsolver novel although The Lacuna is a close second. A bit long for some people, but well worth the read."
3,The Poisonwood Bible - good and not so good.,"The first half of the book was entertaining, but the second half really dragged on. Over all, an interesting book."
2,The Poisonwood Bible,The book was highly recommended by a friend. Unfortunately after several attempts to read the book I gave up. At no time was I able to develop an interest in the story or the characters. Ophrah and my friend enjoyed it. As for me -- as far as this book is concerned I chose poorly.
5,Poverty...,"Being poor takes on a whole different meaning in this novel. I thought I had it bad? Nope, not even close; the depth of these characters, and their trials as well as their triumphs, make this book a great read. It really brought home what I take for granted, every day of my life."
2,Disappointed...,I found the story very hard to get into and then I had to force myself to finish it.
5,The poisonwood bible excellent!,"interesting story, very different from the other kingsolver books but one of her best."
1,I just didn't like it.,Nuff said about it. I thought it was depressing (as are all of Oprah's picks). Doesn't she like to read anything upbeat?
2,I'm glad I didn't spend money on the hardcover edition.,"It is difficult to become engrossed in a book when you actually dislike most of the characters and the plot is thin. This book picks up in the middle, but it's too late by then to really grab you."
5,The Poisonwood Bible,"Finely crafted and cleverly unique, this book of superbly developed characters and vivid settings touches a place deep within the reader's soul. Nathan Price, a self-righteous, oppressive missionary and equally tyrannical husband and father, takes his family into the deepest reaches of Congo. Their adventures are fascinating, but the interaction of personalities is mesmerizing. This book is a gem and each word is so carefully chosen that it oftentimes reads like poetry. Filled with compassion and love and forgiveness, this book is one-of-a-kind."
5,"Like Africa, this book gets under your skin.","How can an overstuffed American not be affected by this novel? My toddler son threw away half his lunch yesterday (and most days). My infant daughter has more clothes than most Africans will have in a lifetime. The house is full of toys and more are waiting in closets for the holidays. Some parents here CHOOSE not to vaccinate their children when African children die of preventable diseases by the boatload. Toys, clothes, vaccines, food - how much we all take for granted. Although I loved the first half of the novel for its characters and its plot, I love the second half for reminding me that we are a wasteful, shallow people. I want to have Adah's intensity, Leah's passion, but, despite thinking about the world's problems from time to time, I feel more like Rachel. Thank you Barbara Kingsolver for this wonderful book and thank you for ""wearing your politics on your sleeve""."
2,Ending Very Disappointing,The beginning is boring and drags on. About 3-4 chapters are interesting and the ending is very boring.
1,Inaccuracy of scripture,"Many people have responded that it is an inaccurate view of Africa. Well, I'm greatly disappointed with her handling of scripture and bible stories. Right from the beginning, her story of Susannah and the prophet Daniel saving her life.....never happened and not evidenced in the bible. Had to quit reading the book knowing that she had no idea or basis to write a novel centered around a preacher (who gives Christianity a bad name, by the way), with no or little knowledge of what is in the bible."
4,First of many Kingsolver,"This is the first book I have read by Barbara Kingsolver *BUT* plan on reading others.I found this book difficult to get into in the beginning of the book. As time went on and I continued reading the book did grab me and I found the story very interesting.Nathan Price, takes his wife and four daughters to Africa to be missionaries. The book explains all that they went through while in Africa and how it came about that some of the family left and left family members behind. The book is wrote by Mrs. Price and the four daughters. Can be a real page turner once you get into the story."
2,I can't breathe,"An avid Kingsolver fan, I found this book disappointing. I didn't love anyone in the book. Everyone was pathetic. Her agendas are quite clear about Christianity, the United States and men. That's okay, it's good to be constructively critical. But it wasn't convincing. Like another reviewer wrote, not one character becomes anyone I admire. It's a dark book with no hope. No hope for the Africans, no hope for the four women. No hope for the father. I had to plow through the middle of it just so I could breathe...looking for some hope. I don't want a pollyanna ending. But really, there are a lot better novels out there about women, Africa, missionaries and their effect on other cultures and visa versa..."
2,Beautiful writing Marred by One-Note Characterizations,"How could Kingsolver have ruined her book with such an obvious error? Nathan is a strident paper doll that flattens the whole story. Just as bad, the author has all the narrators using the same ironic tone to decribe him, deadening their voices as well. At the same time, Kingsolver doesn't have the guts to show him doing something trully terrible. I don't trust an author who can't let the reader make up his own mind, and as a consequence I couldn't trust her views about ANYTHING in the story. I'm giving this two stars for her descriptions of the African landscape, and that is all."
2,A disappointment,"As a long-time Barbara Kingsolver fan, I looked forward to this new release. I was sorely disappointed. I could put this book down, I did put this book down. I got about a third of the way through and decided that no matter the loyalty to the author, I just couldn't wade through it.Maybe she should just stick to what she knows."
1,A real disappointment,"This is my first Kingsolver book and will surely be my last. I must be on a totally different page than the people who raved about this book. The premise was good, but the novel just didn't work for me. Having heard the reviews of this book on Public Radio, I really looked forwrad to it, but as far as I am concerned, it was a total disappointment."
1,Sorely dissappointed,"All set for a great book, I was very disappointed with The Poisonwood Bible. It was full of predictable characters and a long drawn out storyline. The only interesting aspect was the historical value. Borrow it at the library before you spend a dime on this book."
3,what the hell happened?,"I found Poisonwood to be somewhat of a let-down. While Kingsolver's prose is ebulliant and her characterization unfailing, the story disintegrates three quarters of the way through the novel. The Price family's hellish adventures in Africa are narrated alternately by the four sisters and their mother. The first three quarters of the book span approximately two years' time and the narratives of different Price women overlap and contrast to great effect. Kingsolver then unsuccessfully gambled in switching her style, dispersing the narrators' accounts throughout the next thirty years. These diluted remains of the younger Price girls deliver essentially 140 pages of epilogue. In short, the book dies with Ruth May."
2,"Starts out well, ends poorly","I read this book at the beginning of the summer (I had been looking forward to it for a year or so, but hadn't had time to read it during my first year of High School). I expected the Poisonwood Bible to be a tale of the downfall of a family as they brave the dangers of Africa. And, happily, the beginning was written in the poetic (but realistic) voice of To Kill a Mockingbird. It seemed, however, that the author got tired of writing after a while and either subconsciously or consciously began to write sloppily, as if she only wanted to finish the book. She wrote too little that had anything to do with the actual plot (I began to forget what it was, anyway), and too much about the ""plight of the Congolese"".That would be a great topic for a book, but it really didn't seem to fit in with the first part. This book just kept going and going, when I believe it would have suited the theme of the book more to finish it about half to three-quarters of the way through."
3,"very readable, but at times too ""politically correct""","Wonderful coming-of-age tale of 3 missionary children set in Africa. At times, Kingsolver loses her characters as she becomes too pedantic and ""politically correct."" She skims the surface of the dark side of Africa, but exposes every blemish of the missionaries and whites. The novel was very satisfying and easy to read, but not as workthwhile as her other ones."
3,Ambitious novel with narrative problems.,"Yes, I agree that The Poisonwood Bible is a much richer read than Kingsolver's previous works. However, when one utilizes the first person narrative form, one should aim for realistic and age appropriate narration. Pre-adolescent children do not tell their stories out of their frame of reference and gender. In short, the daughters' tales were unreliable due to the maturity and vocabulary bestowed upon them. I think it would be very interesting if Kingsolver attempted the third person narrative. She is a wonderful writer, although the constant self-importance of her political line tends to grate after 200 or so pages. There are many politics, many cultures, many people, many points of view. It would be interesting if other ideas and ideals were allowed to crop up in her work."
2,A book that seems out of focus much of the time.,"This is a book that suffers from the journalist's predicament, flat emotions in emotional situations. There seem to be a couple of reasons why that is so. One of them is the question, what is Barbara Kingsolver attempting to do in this novel? Is she telling a missionary story? Is she telling the story of the CIA's involvement in the overthrow of the newly independent Congo? Or what? It is hard to answer this question. Secondly, her method seemed appealing at first, telling the story of a family unprepared for mission work yet driven by an unsympathetic father, Nathan Price, to the Congo in 1959 when the Congo is being exploited by Belgium, telling that story from the perspective of his four daughters. Each of them has her own peculiar take on their situation; yet each increasing comes to seem disembodied, floating above the people and emotions and reality of their own lives."
3,Disappointing read,"I had heard so much about this book that I think that colored my reading of it. The reason I was so disappointed is because it became very tedious to finish reading it. Initially,I was intrigued and interested in reading about the Price family, but it became too laborious and wordy in the final 200 pages. If you want to read Kingsolver at her best, read the Bean Trees - very delightful and certainly not so long that interest is lost in the characters!"
4,Compelling? That's an understatement.,"An enormous story that grabs you by the collar and won't leave you alone - regardless if you favor the politics of the author or know zip about missionaries or the Belgian Congo. Kingsolver offers 5 distinct female characters who build and drive this tale of spiritual and cultural purgatory. Unfortunately, the evangelical father (he drags the Georgia family to a primitive village mission) remains a bit of a mystery. Like the wind, you see his damage, but you don't entirely understand where he's coming from."
1,Disappointing compared to her fantastic other books,"The Bean Trees and the Animal Dreams just consume the reader, the Poisonwood Bible just confuses the reader. In all her other book I cared about the main characters, but she has not managed to carry that wonderful writing to this book. With the poisonwood bible, I am finishing the book solely because I started it."
3,poisonwood bible,It was written very accurately as a depiction of African cultural. The author has a vivid and unique form of giving words a picture. Would not recommend to the light reader.
2,Navel Gazing at It's Worst,"Somewhere in the middle of these 550 pages is a wonderful story of about 250 pages trying to burst forth. However, slogging through the muck and mire of these pitiful preachers of political correctness and philosophical nihilism was not worth finding the diamond in the rough. The narrative was hopelessly broken by the use of too many voices. The word games that are to help define each character are unconvincing and self indulgent. Nevertheless, the worst sin of this Bible is endless navel gazing. African history was interesting. The plot was interesting. These women were not interesting. Pitiful - pit is full - lluf si tip. The heart of this novel began too late and ended too early. Out of respect for their time, it will not be recommended reading for my friends, family and co-workers."
2,"4 stars for concept, 2 for follow-through","This is a great effort but becomes exasperating half-way through. The techniques the author uses to distinguish one woman from the other become increasingly annoying after they've gotten the point across(Rachel's malapropisms; Adah's private language...)Also, the dialogue among the characters in order to forward the political exposition is very stilted; it didn't sound at all like true conversation but just the author trying to hammer home her belief. I'd give this book 4 stars for concept but only 2 for follow-through. Try a library copy before buying!"
5,Love it.; can't leave it!,Wow! A great read! Holds you all the way through to the end. This book mesmerized me......I found myself living in the Congo.It was sad and exciting al at once.......a truly excellent book.
5,A great read and a page-turner!!!,"After living in West Africa for many years, this book details the conflicts and struggles that are present for both natives and foreigners. The historical aspect of the book is eye-opening for the younger generations who are unaware of the crisis in the DRC. This book is definitely worth a read and you won't be able to put it down!!!"
5,Kingsolver is undoubtedly one of the best,"An exciting story about a fanatical missionary and the impact he and Africa have on his family. Kingsolver's descriptive powers are excellent. Although a little drawn out at the end, it still keeps you turning pages."
4,Tragic but heartwarming,The Poisonous Bible for me was both tragic and heartwarming. The characters were so well thought out I loved each personality. I laughed out loud and cried . The book was long but when I got into it it completely kept my interest. The author definitely did her homework making the book seem like a true story. I definitely would recommend this book to anyone. It makes you want to experience Africa for yourself.
5,Perhaps my favorite book of all time.,"When I finished reading this book, some three weeks ago, I felt like I had lost some very close friends. I still miss the characters. They are so real and so fully fleshed out. I know I will go back and read it again - and probably fairly soon. Excellent book."
3,I could not wait till the end but yet could not put it down,It was a very difficult book for me to get into but yet i did find myself completing the book. I found myself discussing the book with others and telling them how much i disliked nathan Price. I think it was a bit too wordy. the end was more in my opinion Ms. Kingsolver's oipinion instead of the characters it was as if she had to make her point as well as here politics.
4,"Hard to get ""into"" but when Adah starts, can't put it down.","I'm a big fan of the author, loved her previous books. When I started this one, didn't know what to do with a baptist preacher going to save the 'savage' souls of Africa. But I kept reading and finally couldn't get enough. I appreciate her new influence and am grateful to learn of her knowledge of the Congo."
4,A rare and consumming glimpse into the heart of Africa..,"This novel is sylistically light years beyond her previous ""Arizona"" novels. If Kingsolver wears her politics on her sleeve a little too prominenetly, one is inclined to forgive her given the depth of her characters and the revelation of the wonderful/terrible world of the Congo in the 1960s. The prose was perfect. I simply could not put this book down. Although the ending seemed a little too neat and complascent, I was so emotionally exhausted when I got there that I really did not mind."
3,Difficult to get into...,"This book was very highly recommended by a friend, so I figured I'd read it. I actually gave up on it, but she told me to keep at it, that she put it down 3 times before finally finishing it.It got better about 200 pages into the book, but I still am not thrilled by the story.However, it gives a unique perspective on American and World history. Another interesting thing it will show you is about consumption. Americans and Brits use five to ten times more of the world's resources than people in third world countries. This is painfully obvious in the Poisonwood Bible. I was considering this book as part of a World History curriculum, but decided it was too much for freshmen to get into.I suggest you keep plugging through if you find it difficult to read."
5,Extremely Insightful and delightful!,"Great novel. Kingsolver is an insightful writer. I loved the fact that she did research about the people and the culture. As an African, I was very sceptical to read a novel written by a white American woman whom I believed would never fully understand the culture and psychology of the people she was writing about but she did a great job. Characters are well developed and the plot is also engaging. I recommend this book for all."
2,Not The Kingsolver We Know And Love,"I have read all of Kingsolver's previous works, including her essays. This book pales in comparison. You knew where the characters and the story were going long before they got there. I wish I could say I enjoyed reading it. This is the first time I have ever put down one of her books without finishing it."
2,"Boring, Tedious and Very Dry.","We read this book for July Group and I am shocked and amazed that it has been so popular. Being a person who is not that interested in the Congo and it's historical happenings, I was incredibly disappointed that that was what Kingsolver focused on most. I wanted more character developement, dialogue and interactions between the Price women and Nathan!"
2,Too long,"And too wordy. And why would any wife go along with the hard life imposed on her family by an unhinged husband who is blinded by his religion? Some (I think few) missionaries had the right approach, balancing existing native beliefs with church teachings, this one didn't."
2,Poisonwood Bible,Grandson had to do a opening school day report on this book.. didn't realize it would take so long to receive it but the book came in good condition and he managed to get in done in the week he had.
2,pros & cons,"The best thing about this book is that the original Middle Hindi text of each poem is included. The side-by-side text adds a great deal for a reader of both languages.However, a reader of English-only would probably enjoy the Andrew Schelling versions of Mirabai's poems more."
5,Wonderful love poems,"A message of love from Meera...Expecially suited for women, who will certainly understand Meera's message, from which sensitivity pervades all along."
5,The Very Clumsy Click Beetle,This book was very entertaining. This book also went over how to try again at something we may not be good at. My child got the concept of this from this book!Very colorful pages and great sound effects for the clicking sound version at the end of the book!
3,Interesting topic,I love bugs and I thought this was a perfect and unique book to read to my daughter. She enjoyed it a lot. The book makes the clicking sound at the end and I like that the pages of the book are a lot thicker than normal books. I still prefer Eric Carle's other works.
4,Odd-ball,"I work for PaneLess Window Washing and Roof Cleaning in Montgomery and Bucks County, PA.We have at least 15 ladders at our disposal so, this ladder does not see a ton of action but, it is the most stable ladder that we use. The width prevents us from using it indoors (stay the commercial jobs) but, it is GREAT for many outdoor applications. I love this ladder. I think that most of our ladders are ""Werner"" ladders."
5,5 ESTRELLAS SE LO MERECEN,"EXCELENTE BUEN PRODUCTO Y SE ENTREGO COMO SE ORDENO NUEVO DE PAQUETE Y EL PRODDUCTO QUE SELECCIONE, YA LO TEENGO EN MIS MANOS EN MARACAIBO - VENEZUELA, EXCELENTE......"
2,No Ebook?,The book industry continues to screw students over. Make an ebook damnit! Other than that it is fine. I wish the textbook industry for music would move into the 21st century.
2,"Not an adequate biography, nor an adequate critique","As a college undergrad I took a music course taught by Lockwood many years ago. He was good as a teacher, and I knew he was a LvB scholar, so I always hoped to see a book about LvB's music. After I left college he published not one but at least two such books.This one was written for the general audience, someone who wants to learn about LvB's life as well as his music. Unfortunately, the interweaving leaves the book in the awkward position of fulfilling neither purpose. As a biography it's too brief, and if you were looking for in-depth analysis of LvB's great music you'd be disappointed like myself. I guess one purpose it can serve is as a casual introduction to the background of LvB as a person and as a musician, against the cultural-political backdrop of his times. However, I myself find the coverage too shallow, way too shallow."
1,waste of money,"This product doesn't deserve even one star. UnfortunatelyAmazon doesn't have 0 stars rating.I bought this ladder to clean gutters on my 2-story house.At 16' ladder length + 6' my height I figured it'll be morethan enough. Not so: ladder extends to under 13' and, waitit gets better, the maximum working height (the last stepof the ladder you can use) is 9'. All I'm able to reach isthe 2nd floor window.Why do they call it 16' ladder at all? Very misleading :(Now I'm stuck with this over-priced piece of metal I can'teven return. By the way, being 170 pounds, I don't feel safeon that ""200-pound rated"" thing - it's very shaky (the baseis too thin)."
4,Good Ladder,"I bought this ladder to change outside floodlights which are at about a second story level. The ladder did not quite reach that far, so I purchased a 24 foot ladder. However, I have used this ladder to change the outside light in front of my house which is at a one story level. The ladder worked well for that purpose. The ladder is easy to operate and not to heavy to move around."
3,Too lightweight,"I suppose it's my fault for ordering the cheapest one, but after having used it, I would have ordered the next weight/strength level up. I weigh about 180, and it sometimes it feels as if it's about to buckle. Works fine in all regards, though."
1,workbook,I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED. THE BOOK WAS ADVERISED LIKE NEW. IT HAD WRITING AND HIGHLIGHTING ALL OVER IT. I WILL HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER ONE. I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE.
3,Captures the spirit of New Orleans,"As romances go this one ranked above average even though not in my top ten to read. What I enjoyed most was the flavor of the book. Pappano captures the city and it's less prosporous districts very well. The characters, basically speak as if they do exist and grew up in that area of the city. I would have liked to see a little more of that areas dialect used, but being from that area of the country I know how difficult it would be to write the way that particullar area talks and make the story enjoyable for all readers. The descriptions of that area of New Orleans are very well done and you can actually picture yourself there. Some of the topics in the book are dealt with in a shallow fashion, But all in all this is a good afternoon read. I say thumbs up to the final book in this series and a fond farewell to all the characters."
2,Evil Movie,"This movie twists history around so much, that in the credits, someone is listed under: ""Story By""!! On the plus side, the animation is stunning, and the music is great."
4,Fun set,Easy to assemble and kids liked the figurines. Wish there had been more horses to go with the figures. Nice set
5,Huge Hit!,"Frontier Logs are a hit with my boys, ages 6 and 9, and my girl, age 8. My husband loves them, too. ;) We love that they are all wood (no cheap plastic) and that they came with figurines. Hours of fun in our house!"
3,Missing pieces.,My son was given this set as a Christmas gift. It was missing the 6 triangle pieces needed to put the roof on. I'm going to try an contact the company to see if they'll send me the missing parts.
1,very disappointed,"This product should not be purchased. The quality of the logs is shockingly inadequate. They are so poorly cut that it is impossible to build anything near to a stable structure. My grandsons (and I) found it impossible to enjoy the product--so much so that I simply threw them out in frustration. Amazon should be ashamed to include this product on its site.POOF-Slinky 220L Ideal Frontier Logs Classic All Wood Construction Set with Sealed Storage Box, 220-Pieces"
1,Disappointed,"The only thing I liked about this item was that the roof pieces were made of wood rather than plastic. I was disappointed with everything else. Some of the logs were not sawed squarely so that they did not fit together quite right. Some of the pieces had been splintered during manufacturing and they were still included in our set. The vegetable wax that the blocks are coated in rubs off and leaves a coating on your hands. The plastic figurines need a more steady base to stand up on properly and a better paint job. If I had been able to look at these blocks before I purchased them, I would not have bought them. Also, be advised that they are not made in the USA as some websites claim."
3,Small beauty!,"The small size of this book is a disappointment; when another reviewer mentioned the too-small size, I thought the book might be 6 x 8"" or so. Instead it's about the size of a postcard, and some pages contain multiple advertisements. Also, the small blurbs the author has inserted are sometimes inaccurate. Still, Hello Gorgeous! is a lovely book for anyone interested in nostalgia, cosmetics, consumer culture, or advertising. I enjoyed it a great deal, especially looking at it with my mom, who remembers some of the products. I definitely plan on keeping it for reference, and for fun. Still, if you don't have Kathy Peiss's Beauty in a Jar, I would recommend you buy that book first."
2,BORING!!!,"After having purchased the previous Sims games for Game Boy Advance, I was eagerly looking forward to this game, wondering what they could do with it. Don't expect the narratives and tasks that came with the previous games -- this is more like the PC version of The Sims, only without the creativity. If you have a choice between this version and the PC version, pass on this one and head straight to the computer -- it's more fun."
2,"Unique is not best, but best in it's class","This is not the best hands-on, how-to book about designing your own Unreal Tournament mod but it is the only book available. Thus, like the first Gutenberg printing press, it's the best in it's class! In the tutorials the authors assume that you already know as much about the Unreal Editor as they do. If you do not know the in's and out's and idiotsyncrasies of the Unreal Editor(which is why I bought the book in the first place) you will learn new definitions of patience during the first 23 chapters. In the end you will thank the authors for their altruism and capatalistic guile without which this knowledge would not be publicly available. Thank G-d and the great Satan for freedom of information! Thank America for the freedom to say this!"
1,deception,"The book is misleading in that it says you can use the editor supplied with the CD to create the tutorials. YOU NEED UT2004 to create the tutorials.Page 3 of the introduction states"" the book includes a CD packed with all the necessary assets, the Unreal Runtime Engine demo..."" This implies that the only thing you need is the book and CD. WRONG!!Also, many of the tutorials have mistakes in them...which are corrected in the 3dBuzz web site forums. Good luck! and lots of patience."
5,Great Book!,"I was brand new to all aspects of game design, and I had no idea where to start. So I opened up the book preview in the Unreal Tournament folder and saw this book. I went up to borders and bought it a week later. I've had this book for almost 3 weeks now, and Holy Crap! From the start, it explains the history of the Unreal engine and gives you a close up look of all the tools used. It has in-depth tutorials that make designing your first map a breeze. The CD contained in the book also has the May 5 Personal Learning Edition on it. In fact, the CD is my only complaint. This book expects you to use the CD for every texture and static mesh used. Overall, the book is a must buy for any begginner."
3,Not great for 1000 pages.,"I was using UnrealEd before I bought this book and I wanted to gain more insight. This book contained almost nothing I didn't already know and I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who has used UnrealEd extensively. It doesn't cover what you would think for 1000 pages. It only covers the basics of everything. But for someone who wants to get into UnrealEd this would be a great book. Don't expect to become an expert with this book, it just teaches the fundamentals, which is still a great start for beginners.Also, one third of the book pertains to 3D modeling, which should be a separate book in itself. Yes, it's great to know about 3D modeling when creating maps but it's an entirely different field."
4,Haven't Used it just yet...,"I just bought this book, and although It seems like it's going to be great, my major problem is finding either Maya PLE 5.0's registration number, or Maya 7.0 PLE and its registration number.the Autodesk site only has Maya PLE 8.5 to download and there are only plug-ins for Unreal for Maya 5.0 PLE and Maya 7.0 PLE (note: there is no version for the regular Maya)So it kind of leaves you stuck with nothing to use. There is also nothing on the net about it either."
1,Horribly defunct,"This was once a great book on the subject of level design - I have no reason to doubt that. However, it is no longer of any use. You need to supply your own copy of Unreal 2000 to work with the book, and that game is out of date. Moreover, you need to supply your own copy of Maya 9, which you can no longer get by any simple methods."
5,getting too serious??? ...buy this!,"It's very very good! And even if you dont play unreal the techniques, tips, tricks and methods shown are very useful!"
1,Super outdated,"The new UDK is sooo different than what is described in this book, unless you're stuck in the past... Also, the Maya 5 that is included on the disk is really a link to Autodesk's Maya and you will not be able to find a license code for the Maya 5 (anywhere), and the trial version of Maya on Autodesk can be accessed independently of the book. Also, the newest versions of UDK are all available online (free) as well. Recommendations for the financially challenged are: online, get the new UDK, get a free 3d modeling program called Blender and utilized the myriads of online tutorials to get you going. But, on the other hand... unless you just like collecting books..."
4,Improbable Fun,"Never thought reading about the military could be fun - or funny - until I read this little gem. The chapters are short, concise and interesting. You can skip chapters or read it straight through. Believe me, you'll never loose a history question in Trivial Pursuit again once you've finished with this book! Learn, laugh and educate yourself about the military with this great little book!"
3,"Great Book, except for","Lt.Col.Brooks shot himself in the foot on his overated commanders chapter. As most modern war college and west point grads, the new mind set is that the Virginia son's General Lee and Jackson were fair generals at best. For a brief year in France in 1944-1945 the U.S. Army with their allied forces fought offensive battles that involved an a well trained and talented enemy. General Lee led his army for four grueling years against a difficult opponent, The U.S. army and Stonewall Jacksons valley campaign was one of Gen. Edwin Rommel (another fair commander) watch words. As with most U.S. miltary minds General Giap( another fair commander) did not defeat the Japanese, French or American forces in Southeast Asia. But the book is a great read, with details on strange and odd folks on the stage of World History and I will keep this book in my library."
3,Reasonably entertaining/interesting to newcomers to military history......,"I'm not sure if it's a simple lack of objectivity or the author's desire to appeal (predominantly) to American readers that inspired him to include several undeserving (of top 10 standing) officers in the earlier categories. Dupuy and Dupuy would have a few words to say about many of the selections.The second half of the book is mainly uninteresting, non-relevant trivia. The book would have benefited from longer, more in-depth entries in the interesting earlier sections and simply cut the pulp of the second half out completely."
4,A good read with believable characters,"Ann Hood has a clear voice and tells believable stories about modern women in real-life situations. I knew I'd be in for a good read. I wasn't disappointed.Ruby is the story of a young widow, still grieving for her husband, who takes in a young pregnant teenager. They're conflict of course as they each have different needs. And the conclusion is satisfying, if not perfect.The book does have some faults. I would have liked to see just a few less scenes about the past marriage because the story was really very much in the present.But it is an easy book to read -- a mere 225 pages, and it moves quickly. The characters are real and they drive the plot. And I was drawn into the story and held there for the well-crafted story."
2,Not so good,My daughter loves Sesame Street but this dvd is really boring and she lost interest quick and hasn't touched it since. I ask her if she wants to watch it but she does not. This will go down as one of those purchases that I wish I could take back but I am stuck with it.
1,Not like the picture,"I thought I was going to get a tall ladder, but it was just a step ladder. I should've read the full description more carefully. I returned it. It's not like the picture at all. I ended up going to my local hardware store and getting what I wanted for the same price as this little one."
4,Gets job done,"When looking for a stroller, I wanted something that would stand the test of time and a family. This stroller is does that. I like the storage under the seat and the cover that comes with the stroller at no extra cost."
5,"love it, love it, love it",this is by far the best thing i ever bought.. i took my son up to his great-grandmother's for the week and ended up leaving his big stroller up there.. it's perfect for a little car like mine ( 2door cavalier).. its doesn't take up any room at all.. i recommend everyone have one..
4,Great Product,I am really glad that I purchased the Capri Stroller. My nine month old son loves this stroller! It has all the amenities of the larger strollers but is so lightweight and folds like an umbrella stroller. It really saves space in the trunk for other items. Although I do wish the bottom basket were a little bit bigger--not really a lot of room for storage. We are taking a trip up north this month and it will be a lot easier to travel with this stroller than our larger one.
3,Not sturdy enough,"It's the stroller I keep in the car for the occassional errand that would be too long for baby to walk and for walks on the towpath (maybe used in that capacity 8 times.) The wheels are shot, loose, squeek, and don't turn properly. The visor is broken, bent, screws are loose. My daughter is 16 months and hates being in this one because she can't sit up straight enough. You'd be better off buying a cheap unbrella stroller every year. Fold up and carrying strap and bag are nice. Rain cover used only once or twice. Not a good overall value in my opinion."
4,"Nice stroller, needs better handles","Since our son was getting older, we decided to purchase this stroller as a lightweight alternative to our Graco Quattro(which we LOVE and HIGHLY RECOMMEND!). Although this is really a nice stroller for the price, I do have a problem with the handles. I wish they were a little longer and padded. I am only 5'1"" and find that I hit the wheels while I am walking behind. This is more of an issue for my husband, who is 6'. I know they sell handle extentions, but for the price, I could have just purchased a better model."
3,Not quite what I wanted,"The stoller is okay. I looked at a lot of strollers, but didn't really know how to decide on one. If you do decide to buy a stroller, if you can, see if you can walk quickly in the store with it. You will then avoid some of the problems I experience below. It's an okay stroller if you won't be using it a ton.We took it on the plane and it was easy to fold up and fold down.I'm 5'7"" and I need the handles to be about 2 inches taller.Also, while walking my feet have a tendency to hit the wheels.The blue canopy needs to be over your child at all times, otherwise it falls to the ground. The storage area is a little hard to get to."
2,Could be better! Not for Heavy Children,"I bought this stroller for my 2 year old who is 34lbs. Well, I guess the stroller isn't meant to carry this much weight cause it is very hard to steer when a heavy child in it! The seat already tore some. Get this knowing that it will be useless after 30 plus lbs.Go with something else!"
3,"Great at first, not so anymore!","I bought this stroller from BRU in late September 2004. It seemed to be just what I was looking for, something lightweight and had somewhat of a recline position. My son loved it the entire time we had it. After a while it became hard to steer with one hand. The sun canopy kept falling off if you had it in the not in use back position. I was able to over look these though. Then all of a sudden both metal supports ripped right through his seat. Of course this happened RIGHT after my 90 days had expired. I took it into the store anyway being used and without box or receipt (I had my fingers crossed). The manager was very nice and said he sees them returned for this reason all the time.We now have the Euro Trend Sport Stroller by Baby Trend. I LOVE IT! It has a bigger basket, a better sun shade, more of a recline and is much softer for my guy to sit on. He loves this one too. It has taller handles and seems easier to steer with one hand.Good luck in your hunting!"
5,"Awesome, comfy and durable",This stroller definitely is worth every penny. It has just been on a whirlwind 3 week European adventure and is perfect for travelling! My daughter loves it so much more than her big expensive stroller (and takes her naps in it too!)and it is so light weight and convenient that my husband and I love it too.
2,"Too expensive for what you get! Better ""greens"" out there!","As my title says, there are a lot better ""green foods"" type products on the market. Taste is not near as good as Now Foods Phytofoods, Magma Plus or the Green Vibrance I tried.Ingredient list does not hold a candle to any of the three products I mentioned above, and the prices for the three are actually lower per ounce. After multiple trial and errors I decided the Green Vibrance (approx 1 dollar a serving) is the best quality for the money, if you are on a budget the Now Foods Phytofoods has a 2 pound bottle that knocks the price per serving around .50 cents.Still shaking my head why Daily Greens wants almost $30 for 10 ounces for an inferior product."
4,Very enjoyable,"Like others in the series, this novel delves into details about the hero's life (in this case, his hobby of mountain climbing); that can sometimes cause the pace to drag a bit. The aunt & father were very nearly stereotypes, as was the hero's now-deceased father until the end. Appearances by lead characters from other books (friends of Evan's) do not make any kind of splash here--they just show up and have almost no personality (when they were very intriguing in their own books).Otherwise, however, the book was a very good read with strong leading characters and a few interesting secondary ones, especicially Catriona's brother and some of the climbers. Mores and biases add to the historical detail, and both tension and emotion are usually kept at just the right level. It's a slow burgeoning of a relationship that starts off suddenly but takes time and understanding to grow into sometimes more than attraction...a situation that makes for a more realistic relationship."
4,Classic Susan King,"I truly enjoyed this book-it was standard Susan King material. You felt as if you were on that mountain top and you felt the cold right along with them. The scenery and the history behind the story and the mountain climbing was a special addition to her tales as her research always is. The hero/heroine had a beautiful relationship that you yearned for throughout the story. I still feel that Taming the Heiress was the best of the trilogy, but this comes a close second."
1,Too brief. Appears to be from a Shi'ite perspective.,The book does not follow the traditional norms in reviewing and commenting on the Holy Book of Islam. Could be due in part to the fact that the man writing the book is using improper references or is himself a shiite. In which case the material should be considered worthless. There are many other books on these subjects available through Amazon and almost any would be a better buy. (sorry if I hurt anyone's feelings)
1,Not what I expected!,I felt the picture did not show that the charm looked smaller than a baby charm. I was very disappointed for the money.
3,Enthusiastic playing/Interesting recording technique,"This disc quickly became one of my favorites. One has a sense that it was fun for the musicians, and that also makes it fun for the listener. The recording sounds very live, and there's a lot of room presence. I'd seen a documentary on the making of the film/soundtrack, and learned that they used very few mics, and hid them so as not to be seen by the cameras (these tracks were recorded live while shooting the film!). Sonically, it's a fun experience because of this ""realness"", and if you enjoy showing off your music system's capabilities, this is a good disc to do that."
4,Worth looking up,"I read this book years ago, don't recall why I picked it up but the topic came up in a chat room and I realized I recall a great deal of her story, a sign that a book was entrancing. This autobiography covers the author's strange and disturbing upbringing (her father would torture the kids by bringing home chocolate, implying that it was for the kids, and then eating it in front of them) without blaming who she was on her father or anyone else. I guess a good or bad aspect, depending on point of view, is that it makes a pretty good manual on how to steal jewels, if that's your inclination."
4,This will teach you a little bit of everything.,"This book is great for learning a bit of everything, but when it comes to developing special skills, a book should only be about one thing. I recommend it as the first book, because it helps you try out all possible different props."
2,Don't waste the money!,"This book has some good ideas, but is annoying to read because of Finnigan's condescending tone and childish banter. The illustrations are sometimes useful, and there is some great sections of making money on juggling and good strategies on performing, but the actual instructional section is rather below average. One would be wise to invest in something else."
3,Good Reference Book for Inspiring Jugglers,"This is an acceptable book for beginners who can learn through reading. It does an adequate job of teaching the basics through illustrations. It also provides instruction for variations of juggling including: cigar boxes, devil sticks, hats and plate spinning."
3,Good For Beginners,"""Don't Let The Title Fool You."" This book is good for an up and coming juggler to get an idea and feel what balls, rings, clubs, devil sticks, diabolos, hats, cigar boxes, plates, etc, the soles of juggling are about and learn the basics of them. This book will get someone hooked in juggling and wanting to learn the different categories of juggling. Then there addiction will soar!!! They can go to more advanced stuff after that the ""real"" tricks (ie Mill's Mess, Rubenstein's Revenge, etc) and ""real"" books (Four Ball Juggling, Encyclopaedia of Ball Juggling, etc) of juggling. And get yourself some top quality juggling props. To become a bad boy of juggling. Then maybe become a member of the IJA. If this book will start your juggling passion, then more power to you!!! Then buy the name brand props ie Dube, Todd Smith, Renegade, Infinite Illusions, Beard, Henry's, AJA, etc!!! And join the IJA you'll love it!!! Juggling's a Great Addition/Passion!!!"
5,The best,I am 12 and i got this book when i was 10. I learned much of the basics and went on and learned even more of the art of juggling. i can now do a diablo use tricky sticks and juggle clubs rings and balls and scarves. for adults and kids alike this is a must get for anyone learning how to juggle
1,Awful service Product great,It took nearly a month to get this.It said 7 days. I needed it sooner and they didn't come through for me.
5,A wonderfully crafted tale . . .,Ms. Foley has surpassed herself with her latest addition to the romantic fairytale kingdom of Ascension. Princess is a wonderfully crafted tale with interesting characters and a compelling plot. This is definitely a book I'll keep on my bookshelf to read again and again.
5,It Grabbed my Heart and didn't let go!!!!,I've read alot of romance novels but this is the first one to grab at my heart from the first page and never let go in a truly long time. I was touched by the longing that Darius and Serafina felt for each other. I eagerly await the next installment in the series.
5,BEST ROMANCE OF THE YEAR,"If you love big epic advnetures that will make you laugh, cry, and stay up all nite, don't miss this book. I have read thousands of historical romances and this is one of the best this year. Exciting, hot, tender. Darius is to-die-for! Keep writing, Gaelen! Anxiously awaiting Prince Charming..."
5,Wonderful read,"This is the second in the Ascension trilogy and picks up right where you would have expected her to. If you wondered what would happen to Darius from the 1st book, you need not worry - he is the star of this book and so very well described. The way she explains her characters make you feel like you are there every step of the way. It is a story of mystery and romance tied together to keep you wanted more."
1,Embarassing!,"Cliche-ridden, tired, trite phrasing. The heroine is the most beautiful, willful, lovely, spiteful, etc. etc. The hero is beautiful, dark, brooding, etc. etc. I could not finish this book because I cringed every time I turned the page! Really bad!"
5,Ms.Foley does it again!!,This book is even better than Pirate Prince(if thats possible).Darius the hero was so tortured thinking that he wasnt good enough for Serafina even though she loved him since she was a child.Their romance was tender and quite touching.It was nice to see what became of Lazar and Allegra. I assure you if you liked Pirate Prince you will love Princess.I did.
2,Stiff and uncomfortable,"I find the Hugger Mugger yoga strap to be unpleasantly stiff and uncomfortable. It digs into my skin (unlike the ""barefoot"" ones used at my yoga studio). If you prefer a softer strap you may want to avoid this one."
5,Shoulder Mugger,I am using this strap as part of a rehab program for an arm/shoulder injury. It stabilizes the joint and was recommended by my therapist. Well worth the $$
2,Standing Straight,"This belt is too big for me and doesn't synch tight. I can use it, but it is not one I would recommend to others."
5,Great strong strap,"This is a really long strap, great for taller people and men in particular. I bought this for my husband and am going to get a shorter one for myself. The fabric is great; natural fiber, very strong, good colour, well made."
5,"Good product, good transaction","Received new product well wrapped, within shorter delivery time period than projected, and at a great price. The set is as described and looks beautiful on the hearth. Satisfactory all around."
3,which show are they talking about?,"usually i don't rate shows that haven't even been released yet, it's just senseless. but here i actually have a question. the dvd cover obviously shows lifetime's tv show ""missing"", which i would like to order, but the details on this page describe a reality show about actual missing cases with a 30 min air time. i'm not quite sure what to think of this."
3,really missing,although i enjoyed this season we are stilling misiing seasons 1 and 3!!! which were far better. please bring out on DVD!!!
1,AWFUL!,"Any serious student of history should avoid this opinionated, controversial and dry account of the Middle Ages. The author opens his book with a charming three page analysis of the Roman Golden Age, exclaiming, and this in a TEXTBOOK mind you, ""If this was humanity's happiest time-God help us all!"" He relegates the achievements of the Renaissance strictly to the realm of the aesthetic, even going so far to lament the fact that the slender and mysterious saints of the Middle Ages seem to have ""turned voluptous"" in the workshop of Michelangelo... Perhaps the author had some bad experiences in the classics and developed an abhorence for their achievements which he feels he must emphasize in his textbook. Even worse is his one sided, clinical and insensitive view of history; only in Hollister can the reader read of the horrorrs of the Black Plague without blinking an eye. AVOID!"
1,"I Agree, A Poor Choice For A Textbook","I strongly agree with the former reviewer's comments. This book, (superficially ugly, uncolorful and poorly illustrated), is boring and opinionated,cramming one thousand years of history into fifteen or so so chapters. Hollister, who, I'll admit, clearly loved his subject, made the mistake of emphasizing again and again that the Middle Ages were THE domiant force that created modern Europe- history is not a contest, but should accurately reflect the past and incorporate modern interpretation and, (the element most strongly missed in Hollister), constant primary sources. For the responsible instructor looking to teach a worthwhile course on the Middle Ages, numerous sources should be used, and by no means should this out-of-date book form the backbone of the course."
5,Great Short History,"This book is a great overview of medieval Europe. It is packed with information and is a dense read, but worth it."
5,Informative,"I read this text for a survey course on medieval history. I found the book to be better than most general history texts I've encountered in the past. The organization is superb and the writing is crisp and to the point. Oftentimes it was difficult to highlight anything because every sentence contains useful facts. Hollister writes with good humor in a subject that often lacks amusing anecdotes. The book starts with a brief view of Roman history and ends with the development of the Renaissance. There are chapters on Byzantium and Islam, as well as sections on medieval art, thought and architecture. Sidebars illuminate important medieval figures such as Hildegard of Bingen. Anybody reading this book will come away with a good foundation on medieval Europe."
4,An especially well-balanced view of the middle ages in Europe,"The first edition came out in 1964, and has become a franchise in the American texts on the subject, now carried forward by a younger historian, J. Bennett. Hollister wrote the first few editions alone, writing clearly and making narrative sense out of the confusion of centuries, peoples, without an overload of academic quarrels, so it is a good book for interested readers who are NOT taking a college course in which the book may be assigned reading. Not a trove of original insight, but a balanced view that incorporates the major ideas of more important historians. Readable, although ultimately academic."
1,Poorly written and borderline offensive,"In addition to being terribly written and poorly organized, as many other reviewers have noted, it was, at times, borderline offensive. When she equated the slaughter of chickens for food with the raping and beating of a woman, I had to close the book and be done with it. Anyone who would equate those two things has never been raped or beaten and is probably a crazy fundamentalist with wing-nut tendencies.I was hopeful that this book would be a critical and intelligent analysis of the objectification of women in parallel to the sexualization of meat. Instead it was a mash of PowerPoint-esque bullet point statements, poor writing, and disorganization, without any thoughtful analysis or scholarship. It was nothing but anti-meat, anti-sex, anti-man propaganda."
1,I love animals...,"As a person concerned and active in animal rights work, I find this sort of rant abominable.Publishing this whack-job does as much is doing as much for animal rights and women as Oliver Stone has done in ""solving"" JFK's murder.The idea that this is scholarship is an embarassment to anyone with a brain. A lot of mumbo-jumbo and bad semiotics and flimsy Deconstructionist lit-crit nonsense.It's too bad that hacks like this get encouraged. The saddest thing is, this moron probably at one time had a decent brain, a caring heart, and the best of intentions.Flipping through it is like watching the train wreck of modern education.One can only hope the reading public will put her out of her writing misery."
1,Dreadful,"As a vegetarian, and as someone who is interested in media and the use of it, I had high hopes for this book. They were sadly not met. The idea is good, but the writing is horrible. Adams is all over the place. Paragraphs jump from one subject to another making no sense at all. It is very hard to follow. And there are few references - instead of foot or end notes Adams uses 'citations' at the back of the book and the reader is left to guess what exactly was cited on the page.There is such a wealth of material available on this topic, and in the hands of a better writer this book would have been truly amazing.Don't buy it."
2,The pornography of meat,"This is an interesting book. The theory behind it no doubt has a place in our society. However, the evidence used to support this theory is ad hoc at best. As a result there is no limit on the range that Adams attempts to apply her world view. The chapters lack focus as jumps from topic to topic. I would have like a little bit more unity and building up to the individual chapter focus. The other issue is the books lack of theory that works towards etiology. She does not describe an explanation behind her theory and somewhat bashes evolutionary psychologist David Buss who would provide an underlying theory. To be concise, the book is interesting but it is chaotic and appears to regress feminism back to the negative stereotype of the anger femiminst. There are better choices out there on both feminism and animal rights."
3,Co-author needed,"Any analysis that examines at the intersections of oppression (in this case speciesism and sexism) is important. Unfortunately, Adams is a scattered, non-linear thinker. Her writing is convoluted and fragmented. If a reader is neither a passionate animal rights advocate nor committed to an anti-pornography perspective, s/he is not likely to be very tolerant of the poor writing. As such, most readers who finish this book are probably already members of the choir. This is unfortunate. I hope Adams finds an articulate co-author for her next book. I give four stars for the ideas in the book, and I give two stars for the writing."
4,Werner Extension Ladder,"The ladder is easy to use, and light enough to carry with ease. It is equipped with a rope to extend and retract the ladder. The rope and pulley combination works well, and a person can easily and safely use it.The Ladder is not designed for professionals, but for use around the home, and can be a bit shaky when fully extended.I am pleased with my purchase, and I would recommend it for light, around the home, use."
4,Ladder Review,I received the ladder in several days after placing the order. It is light and sturdy. I climb upon it to clean my gutters and it works well.
4,Pure Unadulterated jazz !!!,"Anita Sings The Most is pure unadulterated jazz at its finest and is a MUST for all jazz purists and collectors. Anita is at her prime. Her ability to scat on particularly upbeat songs is grand. Oscar Peterson on piano shows originality and precision of individuality in his playing style. Ray Brown is, always, without compare. I found this recording to include some of the best songs from the great composers that really aren't heard as often as they should be today. This recording was excellent in AAD format. Thank you all for your art."
4,Enjoyed!,"This is a good book. My seven year old daughter read it. The story is great, but it is written in a dialect that I found a little difficult. However, my daughter was able to read it and enjoyed it. It has some pictures in it but not on every page. The chapters are rather short so they make for great reading segments."
4,Pretty much what I expected.,"This bag performed more or less how I thought it would. I've used this bag in temperatures ranging from 20 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit. I was definitely too warm in the 60 degree range, but a little cold at the 20 degree range. I survived the night of 20 degree weather, but wasn't very comfortable. For me, this bag functions optimally at 30-40 degrees Fahrenheit; but that's to be expected for any synthetic-fill sleeping bag. Usually I look at the temperature rating and tack on another 15-20 degrees. 30 degree sleeping bags are usually comfortable around 45-50 degrees. This bag is fairly heavy, so I wouldn't use it for hiking. It is ideal for car camping and/or canoeing in my opinion."
3,Warm but the zipper is terrible,"The bag is nice and warm. Had it out this last weekend in 35 degree weather and stayed toasty. Not sure how it will be in the teens since I haven't had a chance to try that out yet. The zipper is sub standard though. I had to fight to zip it. I expected a big toothed, easy to manage zipper bacause if it is cold (cold weather bag) fingers might be cold, making it hard to manipulate the zipper. Instead, it has a tiny toothed zipper that hangs up. The zipper tabs are thin, soft metal that has already bent with my attempts to zip the bag. It wont be long until they break off and then I wont be able to zip it at all. Seriously considering returning the bag. For the same price I can go to Dick's and get a 0 degree bag with a better zipper. Put a better zipper on it and I am sold."
2,not at 0 degree bag!,after my son put every piece of clothing he had with him (4 layers) during a winter camp out he was just about warm enough!not a 0 degree bag.
5,Mind Crashin' Tracks,"A myriad of first-rate club tracks, all worthy to be bought, and enjoyed on the club floors world-wide! At the helm of the mixing controls and A&R, is none other than Italian DJ/Producer Prezioso and team. A few new artists and DJs emerge on the track list on this 2-CD album, with the remixing talents of Prezioso and his team that selected every track on the album. Having owned and played this album (some tracks) in the club, I would gladly pay 3 times what the retail price is. My only complaint for this album is that I couldn't give it a 6 out of 6! That being said, buy and enjoy...you will not be dissapointed!Respects!DJ R.E.A.C.H.-eGlobal Underground"
5,Greatttt music!,I will be willing to bet money all this music will come to the US within a year. All great dance comes from Italy and Europe. A must have cd!
2,Bad Script Sinks Sexy Thriller,"This just-about-average erotic thriller is about as thrilling as having a hammer dropped on your head. Is the movie about: A) the problems of fidelity in the lives of an American couple? B)The pitfalls of gambling? C) The decadence of the wealthy? or D) lotsa wild, yet soft-X, sex?I couldn't tell. All I was sure of was that the movie was a bare-bones rip-off of ""Indecent Proposal"", with a pointless mob subplot to prop up the unraveling story. Granted, Tane McClure and Gabriella Hall are hotties, and the sex scenes do have some steam, so the movie isn't a total disaster, but ultimately, there's just not much to recommend here."
5,Wonderful live versions of some classic songs,"If Van Morrison's timid and mostly tuneless back-catalogue doesn't appeal to you, you may still love this happy-go-lucky effort. Track 10, ""All Saints Day"", is the best feel-good song I've got in my whole music collection. The rest of the album contains a host of jazzy gems, most notably the title track which breathes life and soul into one of Gershwin's less well-known compositions. Buy it!"
1,i got ripped off,"i want my money back.i tryed to contact you ,but you dont replay,35 dollars come on give me a credit"
2,just got it,got it for xmas and its ok bluesy van raw and unplugged sorry jay z v to the van m to the morrison punk boy
2,EXPECTED MORE FLAVOR.,I expected more Lobster flavor from this Progresso Product and I felt the Lobster flavor was very weak and I didn't see a speck of Lobster meat in the sauce. Although the sauce was good my guests thought that they were eating regular Spaghetti sauce and were not aware that it was a Seafood Sauce. There is a need for improvement.
5,DISCONTINUED,"The General Mills Brand Progresso Lobster sauce has been permanently discontinued. This is so sad, because this was a wonderful product! Hopefully one day it will return to production!"
3,A lot of chatter to get to the good manners,"I was just interested in teaching my kids what would be considered proper in our society. I had to read a lot of what I consider silly stories to actually get to the manners part. This was an ok book, I just wish it would get to the point a little quicker."
4,The book I truely enjoyed as a kid,"Used to imagine what it would be like to be an orphan...or simply, to live with bunch of kids and just a few adults. I often had to stay in bed with fever for many days when young. Since my parents were both working, most of the times I was just by myself. It's not like I was lonely. It just that this book made me feel like I wasn't alone."
1,drawings of the author missing,I was very disappointed to find the images missing. The book is incomplete without the funny drawings of Jean Webster.
3,"It's companion ""Daddy Long Legs"" was FAR better.","Altogether this book was a lot more original in form than some other books in any library, and is satisfactory. That's an honest objectional review although I was privately disappointed by the way J. Webster decided to write the sequel to ""Daddy Long Legs."" You see, in D.L.L. the main character Judy Abbott is such an entertaining person, whereas the main character of ""Dear Enemy,"" a college friend of Judy's, Sallie Mc Bride takes some getting used to after re-reading the first book 5 times, and quite used to Judy's whirlwind of romance, school, and concealing her past to her best friends. All in all a good book, but to understand it better, you need to read ""Daddy Long Legs"" FIRST."
4,Darling Sequel to Dady Long Legs,LOVED it!! Especially Free ;) my only sadness was the lack of illustrations from the original version. They are so funny!
4,Dear Enemy,"A good read if you want to be entertained and relaxed at the same time. No violence, no sex, no villains. Also the epistolary form is unique and also well coordinated. The story is skillfully told.bf oswald, novelist"
4,The keys are SHARP!!!!!,"I absolutely agree with the previous review about the keys being sharp. Sharp to the point where they aren't very convenient to carry around. The lock itself is great...but...had I heeded the other review, I would have purchased a different brand lock."
1,Lock Sticks,"This lock would be perfect except for one fatal flaw. The lock doesn't work properly. At first it was fine, but as time passed the key would no longer action the lock. This was initially overcome with patient jiggling for a few minutes. Now the lock appears permanently stuck. This leaves my bike unhelpfully secured to an I-beam in Afghanistan. What would otherwise be a strength for this lock, i.e. the impressive thickness of the steel cable, is now a hindrance because I can't find the hardware (bolt-cutters, acetylene torch, anti-tank round, etc.) to release my bike."
4,"Good lock, good price","I have used this lock for about 5 weeks and it has been excellent. It is a good length, and can easily fit through a bike rack as well as both wheels. The cable is flexible and easy to use and store. I would recommend without hesitation."
1,No book,"I did not recieve this book, Please contact me about this. I have been waiting for over a month now and dont even need it any more."
1,Not a Lara Fabian CD!,"I purchased this CD thinking it had something to do with Lara Fabian's music or performace since it was listed that way here at Amazon. When I received the CD and played it, I realized that this CD was not tagged correctly at Amazon, but is really a soundtrack recording from the movie ""la Marche de l'Empereur"" written and performed by Emilie Simon. Also the track listing on this page is not that of this soundtrack, but rather the tracks from the live Lara Fabian concert CD titled, ""Lara Fabian Un regard 9,"" (2006) which I have on CD and also the DVD release of the same material. Thus, I returned this soundtrack to the vendor."
3,Jemima Puddleduck without the Pictures,"This IS the story of Jemima Puddleduck, and it can be read to children. It loses a lot of its interest value without the pictures, but the story is still good."
2,No pictures,"Without pictures this book is incomplete at best. Beatrix is known for her beautiful pictures and it is wrong, even insulting, to present her works without them. There is good news however... project gutenberg has translated ALL beatrix Potter books with pictures for the Kindle free (if you read on a color device such as a pc, you can see the pictures in color). You can get to project gutenberg here...[...]"
2,Don't waste your time,"If you're looking for drama, suspense or anything approaching a real plot, look elsewhere. Not only is the ending predictable, but you'll have to wait through a very long and boring movie to see it. Atmosphere is about all you'll get. Depending on your opinion of jazz or what passes for it in this movie, you may be in for further disappointment. We rented it on line through U-Verse and I'm going to ask for a refund. Belafonte was the only one who was convincing and that's because he wasn't acting."
3,good music but slow movie,If it were not for Harry Bellefonte this one would fall apart. Harry definately held it together as the only acting bright spot.The music was very good. So if you are a jazz fan skip the movie and get the sound track.
1,confusing and stupid plot,"I rented this movie because I like period stories, especially those that take place in the 1920s and 1930s. This movie was about as dim-witted as its main character Blondie. The story was hard to follow because it made little sense, the diaglog really dull,and the movie moved at a snail's pace. And what was with the pregnant black girl? What purpose did that serve and how did it fit into the story?This is one to skip."
5,One of my favorites!,"This movie got mediocre reviews (and some major dissing), but it is one of my favorites. I've watched it about ten times (you almost have to, the story line is so involved--classic Altman). I bought the video, because I will probably never tire of the awesome soundrack, the cool sets and wardrobe, and the great characters and storyline. Very, very dark--loved it!"
4,Saxophone Players,The music in this movie is great! Joshua Redman tears it up with his great old/new style of playing the saxophone!!Doug Earley
2,Atmosphere and little else.,"Even the mighty have their moments when they stumble and KANSAS CITY is one of those moments for maverick director Robert Altman. There's little more than atmosphere in this film; the period-recreation of 1935-ish Kansas City Missouri, the great jazz throughout every frame and a bravura performance by Harry Belefonte as a gambler/crime kingpin named ""Seldom Seen"" don't mask the fact that the plot's thinner than newspaper and that every other actor save Belefonte is chewing the scenery and burping after every chew. On the surface, this movie's approach isn't much different from Altman's others--there's constant activity, so much that it's initially disorienting to try and figure out all of the threads of the story, but in many of his films (NASHVILLE, MASH and GOSFORD PARK, for instance), those threads gradually come together into a whole. It never happens in KANSAS CITY. The threads stay threads and you're left with a jumble, albiet a jumble with a great score."
4,Use With Care.,My five year old ganddaughter has this playground ball. First the good points. It is well made and very durable. She sits on it (or tries to) punches it and is rather tough on it I might say. It is colorful and does a great bounce. The only drawback would be if it hits someone this ball would definitely hurt. As we all know children miss when throwing so using it inside is not an option that is for sure. And it can wallop a real punch if it hits anyone so care must be taken when children are playing with it. It is certainly well made and has lasted in this household for almost a year now. I would not buy this ball for children under 6 or 7.
4,The Original Road Kill Cookbook,"As an avid hunter and cook I found this book particularly amusing from start to finish. Buck does a great job writing and illustrating and I keep it out when entertaining, with dogeared pages, so that my guests can see the recipes I am using. Makes for some lively conversations."
3,Interesting,Being an electronics tech I found this an interesting read. Did some of these experiments when in high school. A little hard to follow as there were no figures shown but they were referred to.
1,Copyright fraud???,This item came to me as a gift for my father and I am very skeptical as to the legitimacy of this book. The book is far bigger than the margins of the script and the font itself is very poorly imaged on the page. The letters look like they have been poorly copied multiple times before they were printed in this book. The worst part of all of this is all of the pictures and diagrams are completely blacked out... also I suspect is because this is a copied product.Do not buy this product. Something is very fishy here. I will be contacting Amazon as soon as possible to get to the bottom of this.
2,This is an example of whats wrong with eBooks,I was looking forward to getting some insight to Dr. Tessler. Although he goes into a lot od detail much if what he describes references drawings and pictures which are not shown in the eBook version.Without the drawings you can't gain the insight you might be looking for in a book like this.
3,It's okay,"I thought it was ok, nothing I haven't read before, but it was enjoyable and I'm glad I got it."
3,where are the diagrams,would be great but without the diagrams it is useless. kindle falls on its face with this one. Waste of time. Dont bother.
2,Not as charged as hoped for,"Nicoli Tulsa wrote this book and his energy does come through, but it is less than I hoped. I have always founds Nicholi to be a interesting character of invention -- and some of that came through."
3,Incomplete,The story is well written and informative. Unfortunately there were several blank pages in the copy I received which left gaps in the story. I ordered this book as part of our homeschool curriculum and didn't notice these errors in time to return it.
2,Not a good choice,"I got this as a christmas gift and it didn't glow in the dark like it said at all, but I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Almost great.,"I ordered these to help with my Morton's Neuroma. I really am liking the level of comfort provided for the area covered by the cushion. The only downside to wearing these is that sometimes if I don't get the cushion positioned just perfectly, I'll get an area off to one of the sides of the cushion which gets a sort of pinched feel to it - so I have to remove my shoe & sock to reposition the cushion. Other than that (which is really a small price to pay for being able to walk comfortably), I am enjoying these."
4,"not a perfect product, but I like it","Not the most confortable. Doesn't always stay in place. Still, I give it 4 stars because it gave relief to ball of my foot.Wash it as instructed, when clean attaches better to your skin."
1,Small footprint and hard,Perhaps this works for callus but definitely not as cushions in your shoes. The footprint is small and padding is hard. If you are looking to purchase to put in heels or pumps as I did - look at other products.
1,Didn't work,"The product did not stay on the ball of the foot as advertised. This was a product failure,not a merchant or Amazon failure."
5,Amazing!,I've had metatarsal pain in my left foot with each step for 6 months. This product relieved the pain instantly. I would definitely recommend this product.
2,Not so good,"This item gave me no relief from the callous on the ball of my foot. Did not help at all. In fact my foot hurt more with this on. It was a waste of money for me.Maybe it works if you wear it always.... that is, prior to developing a callous."
3,FootSmart Gel Cushions,This product did not help my foot pain. It also would move slightly out of position during walking and exercise. Be careful what you buy.
1,Waste of money,Difficult to keep in place and not effective.It appears by how it looks in the photo to be a fine soft to use product but it is not.
1,Adhesive?,Does not stay in place....poor adhesion. Had hoped this would be the solution for metatarsal cushioning for someone on their feet 10 hrs a day walking between 6-7 miles a day. Design seemed to do the job so was disappointed it would not stay put!
1,Won't stay in place,"This pad might work if it would stay in place long enough, but it slips out of place on very short walks, making it totally worthless to me."
1,Not a good Product,"I was so impressed with some of the reviews, I bought 2 sets of pads and could not wait for them to come because I was having some much pain on my left metatarsal. This pad is horrible!!!!!!!!!!!! It made my pain worse. The pain got so bad it went all the way up my leg and was burning so bad. The pad is too thick, so it takes up too much room in your shoe which makes the pain so bad. Also, it dosen't stay in place. The pads ended up all the way down by me heels. Not worth the money!!!!!! Try Footminder's catwalk orthotics They are great!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sorry FootSmart this product is not good."
2,"Gel Callus cushion, what a disappointment!","The gel cushion feels great to the touch, however it does not always stay in place. It can easily be misplaced or lost, especially if you like to remove your shoes at work or anywhere just to rest your tired feet. The gel cushion is an excellent idea however a little more tweaking could have gone into it and, as for the price of the small gel cushion, it could have given you more for your money (larger or extra gel cushions).I am constantly misplacing one of the gel cushions, has anyone found it?.Truly disappointed.Cat47"
5,great little ladder - actually has more uses than you'd think,"I like this ladder a lot, i wish i purchased it a while ago. It's main positives is that it's light and sturdy. It is rated to 300LB which is more than I need. It's light enough where my wife can move it around on the go. I like how it has two steps and a sturdy top step. I can use this around the house but also on contractor needs. it's good enough to be used in the house where a regular ladder is a bit too much and cumbersome."
2,"Sturdy and a good price, but I dread using it!","Pros: Sturdy, great price for what you get!Cons: This is the most horrible ladder to use for more than a few minutes at a time! After standing on it (not the very top, the lower 2 steel steps), it starts to kill my feet! I tried using my mom's ladder to compare and her ladder did not do this and just felt more like a real ladder!Could be me, but compared again to my mom's ladder, my balance on this one was not the best. I felt like I would fall!"
5,Wow! What a stool!,"I was skeptical at first, but you just can't beat a Werner! This step stool features two steps, several screws and adhesives, a plastic top step thing, and a whole bunch of love. If you need to reach things that are very high up (but not too high) make sure you buy this stool. Godspeed, little 2' Werner step stool, godspeed."
1,Weak,"I bought this ladder at Home Depot for use around the house. I was very surprised how weak the ladder is...It says 300 pound rated but I did not feel safe putting my 185 pounds on the top step. It is cheaply made and weak. Wish I could give it a ""0"" rating. Is China the only place that makes a ladder today? Nothing in North America?I have given this ladder to daughter to hold a plant. It works good for that.But this one is only $11Metal Two-Tier Plant Stand"
1,Too much for too little,I feel I paid too much for this product. It seems very flimsy. I think I could have gotten a much better bang for my buck with a different step stool.
3,The lining is a bit flimsy,"The fit and style are excellent. I was looking for a dark nylon windbreaker type jacket and this jacket fits that bill. But I wish it had a more substantial lining of either cotton/flannel/wool or a combination so that it could be more comfortable in tempatures in the high 30s or low 40s. The lining is just one layer of mesh nylon. You really do need a sweater underneath for tempartures below the low 40s, at least I do. Given that it does not have a substantial lining and at just two layers of nylon, one being mesh, the price is probably a bit high."
2,This is not a romance.,"Lets just be clear about that. This is a story about a spoilt, selfish heroine named Carrie who finds out, as an adult, that she was adopted and the fallout from this revelation. That's it in a nutshell.Carrie St John - adopted? The idea would be preposterous, except..... Carrie has never truly felt as if she belonged. Now she has a sister who wants to meet her and a brother no one can find."
3,In Absentia fans should try Stars Die next,"If you're like most people reading PT reviews, you're here because you loved the brilliant In Absentia and you want to try more. This is probably not what you're looking for, being entirely made up of spacey instrumental jams, with some annoying and way-too-long ""radio"" playing and an annoying and way-too-long ""interview"" sort of thing at the end.In Absentia fans should move straight on to the Stars Die compilation, featuring the amazing 20-minute ""The Sky Moves Sideways"" (phase 1.) Stars Die is two fully-loaded CD's of great Prog-rock (apologies to Mr Wilson but that's what it is, and there's no shame in that.)PT is a great band and well worth getting into. This just probably isn't the place to start, although Ozric Tentacles fans would like this, at times it's a dead-ringer."
3,I dont' really know what to make of this--sort of good-ish i guess.,"I sort of enjoy this release, and as the other reviewer mentioned it makes for pretty good chilled out background music. I do however feel that Attention Deficit set a benchmark for jam session collections with their self titled album, and that comparatively this release just lacks in overall delivery. There's just not enough going on on this album to get me excited, it's all just too...polite. Porcupine tree is a great band and they are a supremely talented bunch of blokes, but be advised that this is WAY different to what they normally do and should be approached with a very OPEN mind and a large tumbler of your favourite chill-out drink. (or a fat double blader if you're so inclined...)"
3,Just ok,THis is definitely one of their worst albums. Its not bad but its also not good. Here we have intrumentals or better say jams during their masterpiece Signify. Well its like a background music to a film with a lot of ambient music. Its like taking drugs this album. Well its too much and nothing really memorable. If you are new to Porcupine tree this is the last album to begin with. Start with Sognify and Lightbulb sun.
3,Like Chris said: a little too much filler!,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoy all of ""PORCUPINE TREE'S"" Cd's, but this one is more of a New Age Instrumental Jam Background Disk. Very well Produced and Performed (Time & Patience make's it flow), I like it for it's uniqueness, but then again I like all of PT's Disk, Don't like to compare but they are the closest any band has come in the last 20 years to have that ""PINK FLOYD"" Feel... (try Spock's Beard for a ""YES"" & "" GENTLE GIANT"" touch...)Recommended for true followers & fans, if you haven't heard them before start with Lightbulb Sun, Signify or Stupid Dream...The early stuff is also excellent....Maybe with a little more listening they might get 4 stars.Peace.... while you Watch the ""Sky move Sideways"""
3,no protective packaging,"werners are great ladders but if they are shipped totally naked, with ZERO protective wrapping of any kind, it is inevitable that they will suffer damage during shipping. the first was actually cracked, besides the countless gouges, scuffs and dings. we requested some wrapping for shipment of replacement, but it too arrived ""naked"" and was also so badly scuffed, dinged and gouged that it looks like it has been used for 10 years. at least it wasnt cracked, so we accepted it as our project was time sensitive. another issue was that the delivery driver of the first cracked ladder told us it was policy to hang on to it until replacement was delivered, but it took a few requests to customer service to get the pickup of cracked ladder authorized. too many headaches! but the ladder itself, along with ladder max stabilizer, worked great for getting onto our 35 ft high roof."
3,Slight but good enough,"The latest entry into the ""Swell franchise"" is a slight volume that captures the usual zany approach to life espoused by the authors. Although light on content, the book is a cute, fizzy read and would make a nice ""add on"" gift - a stocking stuffer or the like. With a couple recipes and crafty ideas thrown into the mix of offbeat Swell ideas, it may even become a reference keeper for holiday preparations and clever gift buying.Not the best of the Swell bunch, but still worth a look."
1,Can I get a refund?,"I can't believe I paid money for this book. It's cover drew me in, and since I loved the first Swell book, I thought this would be another good one. Boy, was I wrong. Talk about a magazine article stretched very thinly into a whole book. There's not much between the pretty covers whatsoever."
1,Swell First Draft,"I bought this book and thankfully was able to get my money back. Cynthia and Ilene do great work, I loved their first book, but it was more than obvious that they were rushed to get this to print. The ""illustrations"" look like they were drawn by a 7th grader on typing paper with colored pencils. It eerily reminded me of hastily put together projects I did in High School."
1,Not swell,"Maybe I was just expecting too much, but I found this book to be a big disappointment. It didn't live up to the standard set by the first one."
1,"seen this, done that",Seems like this and all other preceeding works are a regurgitation of someone elses ideas...
4,"Nothing will top the original, BUT....","I actually liked this book quite a bit. If nothing else, it gave me a great idea on what to get for my IMPOSSIBLE to shop for grandfather. True, it can be a bit simple at times, although lets face it, most ""self help/improvement"" books can be. But altogether, this book had some very cute ideas for the holidays that won't necessarily break the bank."
4,Tips & More Tips,"Since Amazon only allows one review per ""Product Set"", I'll give you my impressions of the 4 books: Workshop; Tablesaw; Finishing; Router. I rank them in that order based on their value to the type of woodworking I do. The articles have been culled from Fine Woodworking magazine and you can generally find tips that will help you regardless of your level of expertise.If you have an extensive shop library, you probably have already run into many of these same methods. If you are new to woodworking, these can be a good learning source."
3,Interesting,"His treatment of the French classic ""Toulouse"" is an interesting and enjoyable trip. ""Autumn Leaves"" is beautifully played and recommend it."
4,Very Diverse.,"Aside from English Jam this is a very good CD. Django is my favorite song here, but Jazz Jungle and Shin Jin Rui are also very good and No Return is a fun song too."
1,Good Concept but BAD Game Design,"When I read the game description it sounded like a blast. Then I tried playing it and it was really bad.1. No real in-depth instruction on how to make money2. The employees don't leave and always complaining3. Can't advertise, can't have a project and research project go at the same time.4. Relocating and buying stuff was the only good thing about the whole game but by then your broke.I don't recommend this game at all even if it cost $1.00, buy a soda instead."
1,Bad game! Please do not buy!,"I know I really wanted this game because it looked so good in the store. I was wrong. It took me a long time to figure out how to do anything. I still am not completely sure how to do anything. There are few levels and the only way I could beat it was by using cheat codes. Still, you can just put all you money in the bank and leave your computer and then you will make money. BY NOT EVEN DOING ANYTHING! Now I would only pay $1.00 tops."
1,boooh!!,"Scenarios, make this so boring. You can't build a business, itslike starting over and over again. This isn't a good sim game. They could have made it much better."
3,Not as good as the first installment in this series,"This version of DEEPER is pale in comparison to the original. The tracks here are a lot darker than the former. This album is also more trance driven. There's more filler tracks here, and it's just not as good. I would have passed had I known, but I loved the first collection of DEEPER that I thought this would be good. The selection isn't as good, I could have done without ""Rapture"" by Iio, Purestone's ""Addicted To Bass"" and ""Finally"" by Kings of Tomorrow. The songs that I do like are ""I Wanna Be"" by Shauna Solomon, ""In Stereo"" by Flip Flop. Disc one is stronger than disc two, which the second half totally drags on that disc."
1,Disappointing,If you are expecting to pick up where the first installment of Deeper left off then this album is not for you.I could listen to the previous CD set end-to-end but the experience with this one was definately different.Buy with caution!
4,Nicole Atkins is amazing,"First time i heard of Nicole Atkins was in Pandora with ""Neptune City"" and i loved the song so much that i had to buy the album ""Neptune City"" with is her second Studio Album.Bleeding Diamonds is her first Studio Album and i enjoyed it even more.My only complaint about this album is that it only contains six tracks. Her music style is very different from what i hear on the radio over and over again. This is a very fresh style of music with meaningful lyricsI recommend this to anyone who wants to listen to something different from popular bands and solo artists whose music is just over played in the radio."
5,great item,"this is the same ladder (price and quality) that one would purchase from a local hardware store with the benefit of having it delivered! it was shipped promptly. the delivery company that i dealt with was perfect! this may be where some customers may have the difference of experience. i was able to track every step of the transit and our local company that handled this purchase was prompt and accommodating with communication to arrange delivery as well as friendly with the actual drop off. it did arrive with one little dimple dent (it did not have any packaging but i don't know how one would package an item this size!), but nothing that would affect the operation nor did it compromise the safety of the ladder. i carefully considered this factor after pondering over the negative reviews and decided to take my chance and i am pleased to say that i am one of those submitting the positive! perfect all around!"
2,Damaged in Shipping and cheaper at Sears,"Most of the time that I buy stuff on Amazon, they are the cheapest and the quality of the product received is top rate. Unfortunately this is not one of those times.1) I ordered the ladder from Amazon for $179.00, sears had it for 159.00. I have a truck so I would have no need to have it delivered ($50), if I had ordered it from Sears. So it wouls have been cheaper for me at Sears.2) ABF was the company that delivered the product to me. When the ladder arrived, it was not in any box or plastic wrap. Subsequently, it arrived scratched (pretty bad) on one side. This is a brand new ladder, and should have arrived as such.I am still going to use the ladder, which looks like it will work fine. I just wished I had bought it at Sears (or other retailers like Home Depot and such). I probably would have been happier with my purchase then."
3,amazon is a joke,don't believe their shipping dates because they are liars. also i could've bought this ladder at home depot for $169 - i'll never shop at amazon again
4,working with the best,"tracks feature trios, quartets, a quintet, and on the last track a duet. the three songs not written by mcbride are piano trios, mcbride, dejohnette on drums, and chick corea on piano on corea's tones for joan's bones, and mcbride, dejohnette and kenny baron on piano on wayne shorter's miyako and ornette coleman's jayne.alto sax players on different tracks are kenny garrett, who many listeners consider the best alto sax player of this century and the late nineties, and gary bartz, who i consider the best alto sax player of the seventies and late sixties. steve nelson, these days with dave holland's quintet and big band, is on vibes.the last track, a recording of freddie hubbard's little sunflower, is a duet between mcbride and the french born percussionist, mino cinelu, who has played with miles davis, kenny barron, dave holland and kevin eubanks.the lineups speak pages for the cd."
3,Buggy,"I bought this because my son liked another Curious George game, Downtown Adventure (which I highly recommend but the age range should be 4-8, not 3-6). This game is from a different company and is of very poor quality. The pie fight game crashes in the middle every single time we play, on two different computers. The jukebox game is incredibly slow to load, way too slow for a 3 year old to tolerate."
3,"Amusing, But Problematic at Times","I just bought this game this afternoon for my four year-old twins. They like it, but it has a few issues that are HIGHLY irritating. For one thing, I wish the initial game-choosing menu was a little more clear. We found the Fruit Catch game by accident. Also, on some games, it uses 100% CPU resources! This is bad, especially on the already hot-running small-form factor machine I have set up for them. And most irritating of all, on many games there is no way to stop and try another when your kid wants to try something else. I've actually had to do a Ctrl+Alt+Delete application termination just to get out, and then I have to start the program all over again to play a different game (another review mentioned this glaring design flaw). No wonder they are no longer making this game! It's packed with problems. However, it is entertaining and my girls seem to like it well enough."
2,Can't escape!,"My 4 year old is just learning to use the computer. The games in this software are creative but the navigation is not user friendly. First, it uses only a small square in the center of your screen. You choose a game from the delightful menu but you cannot get out and back to the menu if you want to move on. The games are much too long for my son's attention span and I had to use the task manager to quit the program if when I wanted to leave without finishing the game. I am very new in the kid software realm and could have been missing something but this was much tougher to use than any of the others I've bought."
4,Back to the roots,"This would have gotten 5 stars from me if there would have been a bit more in the production value. Not much in the way of special features here, which is really sad when you stop and think about how rich this could have been with more interviews. Otherwise, this is a must own simply because it is something historic... a new sport was forged here."
4,Classic,"Good,Timeless Epic. Feels a little melodramatic in some areas, especially the female character. Some insight into how the American Civil War affected the English industrial revolution. Will read more of the series."
2,LIGHWEIGHT ADAPTATION,"The track record for successful adaptation of Stephen King novels has been mixed. The good (MISERY, SALEM'S LOT, CARRIE, DEAD ZONE), the bad (SHINING, DREAMCATCHER, TOMMYKNOCKERS), and the ugly (THE MANGLER, MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE, RIDING THE BULLET, CUJO and FIRESTARTER).THINNER unfortunately edges its way into the bad. It's a lazy, contrived venture, hindered by Robert James Burke's one-note performance, which is odd because the basically TV-oriented actor (LAW & ORDER SVU semi-regular) should have jumped at his first feature starring role. Lucinda Janney as his wife also fails to elicit any real emotion or passion. Ironically, TV vets Joe Mantegna (CRIMINAL MINDS), Michael Constantine (ROOM 222) and Kari Wuhrer (SLIDERS) manage to flesh out convincing portrayals.King himself cameos as the NERDY pharmacist.King's novels may be best read rather than filmed. The reader's imagination might be more cinematic than any adaptation?"
3,Feels Like Something's Missing,"I'm sure you've had the feeling that something's missing in a movie. The one thing I must applaud in this movie are the genuinely subtle special effects of the main character's change. The story itself seems a little TOO short and just...ends when you don't really expect it to, like you're hoping it's going to continue. If you read the book, are a horror fan or a Stephen King fan, I'd recommend this movie. Everyone else, steer clear, as unfortunate as that may seem. Rent/buy Misery or the Shining instead, they're much, MUCH better movies.***3 stars***"
5,White Man From Town,"WARNING: Review talks about ending, so be warned. SPOILERSI love Stephen King books, and the movies are also great. My favorites are Carrie, The Shining,& Misery but now I will have to add this to my list of loved Stephen King Movies/Books! This movie had its twists and turns. I didn't exactly like the ending, I wish they showed more on what happened after. Did the pie work on the daughter and the doctor? But I guess that doesn't matter much. This movie was real intense and It even made me wish I could put a curse on someone. You should watch this movie if you get a chance!"
2,Thinner,"I bought this movie and had it lying around the house, waiting to be watched. I was on a King kick so I unwrapped this movie and put it in the ol dvd player. I remember seeing the film awhile back and thinking it was good. Robert John Burke does a great job as the lead role but the movie just seems to be missing something. The speical effects are good but they really didnt give anything to the movie. I did like the end of the movie where Burke seems to be turning into a maniac. Im surprised a sequel wasnt made, it would have be interesting."
2,"Not too bad, but the plots a bit thin!","I saw this the other night on T.V. and as i'm a fan of Stephen King I felt I should watch this film. Unfortunately the plot is somewhat thin (excuse the pun) but its definately fun. Stephen King plays a cameo as a pharmacist as well. Not too bad but could have better. Also directed by Tom Holland (Psycho 2, Child's Play, Fright night 2)"
3,good,this movie is good but lacks an even performance by the actors. you don't get to know the supporting characters that well during the movie.
2,white man from town...,"Get outta town!! What starts off as a horror movie turns into an unintentional, hilarious comedy -- especially after the old gypsy woman gets hit. The characters are charicatures, cardboard stereotypes played for laughs. And I'm laughing. I think the makers of this movie said, ""Screw it, we ain't deliverin anything near horror"" and they made it for laughs. The lawyer is an arrogant fathead (literally) who, in one funny scene, shovels in a trainload of food, and mistakenly flirts with the fiercely vengeful Gypsy daughter who flips him off. I think gluttony is a theme running through King's imagination, like the blueberry pie puking kid in Stand by Me. Also, there's not enough of a payoff at the end; you want to see the effects of his revenge on the good doctor who's trying to cure him, but that's cut out. Well, they should cut out slices of pie instead of this movie."
2,Have a pie.,"It seems that everything that Stephen King writes is turned into a movie of some kind. It is a shame that the thin plot is stretched into a movie. There are some good moments but overal it's to weak to carry the movie. (a curse from a gipsy, after Lawyer Burke kills an old gipsy in a car accident, will lead that Burke loses weight, and more than he would like to lose from his overweight...) For S.K. fans a must to see, but if you want your friends to watch a movie with you, then pic a better S.K. movie from your shell."
2,Pretty bad.,"Neither suspenseful nor scary, Thinner is yet another weak adaptation of a Stephen King novel. The movie strips the book -- which was severely flawed itself -- of any sense of dread or horror, and leaves us with something about as appetizing as a wet noodle. Questionable casting and rather lame dialogue don't help matters. The only bright spot is the gorgeous Kari Wuhrer as a young Gypsy woman. I'd watch her in anything."
1,the title says it all,"never before has a movie had such an apt title as this mess. the plot is as thin as the main person in the movie gets. just really a waste of time and money for me,i thought! skip this mess!!!"
1,It's not a movie that made much sence.,"I'm myself a huge Stepherhen King fan. Reed almost all of his books saw all of the movies based on them. This is the only BAD movie that was ever made based on a Stephen King's book. THE MOVIE JUST DIDN'T MAKE SENCE. It's about this man who first gets extremly fat and then suddently ( don't remeber why) his weigth drop's and he becomes very, very thin. Then I don't know why he want's to poison his whife with a poisoned pie. - I don't know maybe the book is better 'cuz I never read it. Or maybe some people understand it better but I don't think this movie is worth buying. Here are some title of some fun, scary, great Stphen King movies - Carrie - (the book was also great) Cujo >>>>The Green Mile<<<<<<< - (THE BEST MOVIE I HAD EVER SEEN) The Shining The Stand <<< ( Very good movie ) Christine (Also great) Stand By Me ( not scary but a very sad, interesting movie)"
5,Great Movie,"One of the best special effects king film, a must see and own, great story and superb acting....Enjoy."
4,Thinner Thinner,"For the most part I love films based on Stephen King's books. This is a super story! It chronicles the journey a man must take in hopes to free himself of a Gypsy curse after a tragic accident claimed the life of an elderly Romani woman. The man, a popular attorney, was negligent and ""distracted"" or he would not have had the accident. When the police, judge and officials conspire to free the attorney of any criminal charges the olde Gypsy man takes matters into his own hands laying a curse at their feet. Our main character's variety of the curse is to become ""Thinner"" and eventually wasting away. But perhaps his price to be free of the curse might be to high costing him more than he'd stand to lose."
3,eat ur own pie,my favorite line and one which was so true of life. A funny butsatirical movie and true to life humor.
3,Judas song terrible,"This DVD was OK the negative thing is that is seems to put more emphasis upon Judas than upon Jesus at times. there is a song about Judas that sings, ""Your a backstabbing, two faced crook..."" no matter if this is true or not I don't want my children talking like that and I certainly don't want them singing that song. But I do watch it still and just mute the song...my toddler doesn't know the difference and still loves it."
3,Just OK...,"I received the video promptly and should have taken heed to the reviews written on the video before I purchased it. First of all, it skipped, but even more importantly, I was searching for a video on the Last Supper for my First Communion class (7 year olds). The Last Supper section was very glossed over. The focus was more on Judas and his guilt. I really just didn't want to show it to the class. Perhaps for another occassion??"
4,Good Series,"My 6 yr grandson loves this series (except Charleton Heston's intro, which he says is boring)"
5,Very Surprised!,"I've always been one to explore different genres of music, so I bought this cd not really knowing what to expect from it. I bought it because it was part of the Jazz Masters series so I figured it must be good. It turned out to be soooo much better than good. I absolutely fell in love with this music. Now I am on a quest to buy as many albums like this as I can. Stan Getz is so incredible on the sax alone, but you add in Astrud and Joao Gilberto and the music is just magical. I'm a 22 yr old and now that I've discovered this music I can't even bare to listen to the crap on the radio anymore. I am so happy I found this album, this music, it lifts my spirit, and eases my soul at the end of the day!! It is PERFECTION!!!"
5,"What can you say,,it's jazz","If you love Jazz than there really in no explanation required, if you need an explanation, you will not find one that will help you appreciate this wonderful Music."
5,The best mood music you'll ever buy!,"This Stan Getz disc is all good. It's relaxing, it's sensual, it's moody. I bought it for ""Girl from Ipanema"", but now I just love it all. It's a favorite."
3,"Despite the poor optics, this lens can be useful.","I video tape high school band field shows from the press box. The lens is more than adequate to capture formations and field movements for review after the performance. For the price, I am satisfied; but would not consider using the lens as an everyday wide angle lens."
4,It's cheap and it works,I bought this to use on my Sony VX2100 camcorder but it has worked so well that and it so reasonably priced that I've ordered a second one for my Canon S2 IS digital still camera. There is a small bit of bending at the edges but that doesn't bother me. I've sent people original pictures as well as ones where I cropped out the distortion on the edges and they haven't really noticed.I've used it for follow-cam footage while snowboarding as well as still pictures indoors and outdoors and it is so nice to get that extra field of view at the same distance. Whether you are trying to take group photos inside of a small townhome or photographing an area inside a small space like an engine compartment this lens can be very useful.
2,"Bootleg, out takes?","I'm surprised that Phillips would put this out. If you expect to hear Toots, forget it. To label this as a Toots and Elis session is a misnomer! I of course don't fault the musicianship of these fine musicians. I bottom line say don't waste your money!"
4,Wonderful but....,"The reason that I only give this 4 stars (maybe lower?) is not because of Elis who is wonderful on this album - and the songs that she sings on are excellent - but because she does not sing on 4 of the 12 songs, 10 minutes worth on the CD that only lasts 33.5 minutes to begin with. Plus, on one of those Toots wordlessly ""sings"" on Honeysuckle Rose. Ugh.So if you're content with 23 and a half minutes of wonderful singing by Elis Regina - highly recommended."
2,Product Rejected by Stores and Sold to You,All cans dented. That's how they manage a good price on this I guess
1,Werner Ladders break easily,I've had a Werner attic ladder for 4 years... the ladder leg hinge broke. I've used the ladder a total of 12 times and I'm under the weight limit for the ladder. The company's response... buy a new $300 ladder and pay $200 for someone to install it. BAD COMPANY
1,unsafe,"i had a mechanic install it, we used it for about 10 minutes and none of my guys are willing to touch it again. this thing is bound to fail. returning it tomorrow."
1,Too Expensive and too work to install,"Not only are these expensive, but they are difficult to install. You have to cut the feet off your ladder, drill holes, cut a rod to length. A lot can go wrong. Drilling a few holes in the rail is scary enough, but having to cut the ladder down seems like a big liability. Not worth the risk or investment."
2,Too difficult to install.,I was disappointed in how time consuming and difficult the attachments would be to install. I will be returning the product.
5,awsome,"I am a contractor and have owned a set for about 18 years, they needed replaced, so this is my second set, and they are identical to first units i bought, extremely happly."
2,Werner ladder leveler,I have not installed the levelers yet because my model of Werner ladder requires an additional kit that ended up costing $31 from Werner's web site. Amazon should have included this information and made the kit available to purchase.
5,Excellent Leveler,"It took a little time to install this product on my ladder and it was heavier than I hoped, but it worked exactly as it was advertised. There were plenty of cut-out templates to use for all ladder types. I really was pleased the way it worked. It truly is an Auto leveling device for ladders."
5,great product,I have installed this on a louiseville fiberglass ladder. This product works as well in this ladder as on the werner ladders. The instructions are good once you determine what template to use if you are not modifying a Werner ladder. Takes a couple of hours because you need to make sure that each step is followed closely as if you mess up you will have a $250+ ladder with no feet. But is you do this the product works very well. A little silicon spray when you first use it makes the mechanism work even better.
3,somewhat overpriced,"I am a contractor and own four extension ladders of different heights. I have installed leg levelers on all my ladders.When I got around to my 30' aluminum (my tallest), since the ladder is quite heavy and bulky, I decided to spend the extra money on these self leveling units. I must agree with another reviewer, the installation process was quite difficult. I also had to order additional parts because of the type of ladder. After getting the additional parts, it took me several hours to complete the installation.Now, the leveler works fine but it is only slightly easier to level this ladder than the other ones I own that have individual legs that adjust manually with spring loaded buttons. In hindsight, I wish I had installed the manual legs on this ladder as well. I would have avoided the frustration and saved a lot of money."
3,Werner PK80-2 ladder levelers,"These levelers are solid footings for my 32 foot fiberglass ladder, but so far I have not been able to get them to adjust. The instructions tell you to use wax if you have this problem. I haven't tried that but these are tough to get to adjust at all. I'm just using them as solid footings for now."
2,I was disappointed,"What I thought I was getting was a DECORATING book about seashore style. What I got was a book about lots of ditsy little crafts projects -- but nothing on overall decorating. If you want little crafty projects, the book is fine; if you want a decorating book, look elsewhere."
2,A few seashore styles...would be a more appropriate title,"I was a little disappointed, the title inspired more than what appeared in the book. However, it still contained beautiful and inspiring pictures and a few tips on colors, styles, and materials evocative of the sea. Thank you."
3,Engaging... but,"I know you can't choose who has your name, but you can choose, that after finding out they are a swinger, to not interview them. That Jim creeped me out big time. I am glad that there was the x-wife in an interview, to get her point of view. But, why choose a swinger that tells you that BEFORE the interview?If you take the swinger out (I skipped over the whole section where the swingers started to describe swinging etc), it's quite a fun production to watch! Dynamic, and gets you wishing you could ask a few questions of all the Jims as well! :)"
3,Ho To Run A Lathe,"Actually, this book is just a reprint of the 42nd Edition of the South Bend Lathe Works publication, ""How To Run A Lathe""."
2,Dissapointed :(,"After reading the reviews on Amazon, I was very much looking forward to having this deck in my hands, and finally perusing these cards. I have heard much about this deck, and I thought that I would give it a try. Unfortunately, it was not what I expected.I am not best pleased with the card stock. As I shuffled the cards, I was coated in little pieces of broken white-card... flaking from the bottoms of the cards. I was also very dissappointed with the dry-looking imagery. Prague is a beautiful city, and having lived in it for numerous years, I felt that the deck did not do it any justice (pardon the tarot pun!) at all.My advice to anyone considering purchasing this deck? Don't. Ofcourse, it is all a matter of personal taste. [...] I for one wish I had spent my money on something else.Best Wishes,Cassandra"
5,yes it is complete as the title says,"yes it is complete as the title says lots & lots of information,very usable and easy to read"
4,"""everything you always wanted to know about blackpowder..""","This book was very informative, but ""long winded"". This is more a collection of articles than an organized, coherent, book-format approach to the subject. The reading is interesting and it is clear that the author knows his subject, but I struggled to quickly gain the knowledge that I was seeking. This being said, I'm not sure that there is any better resource available. So, if you like me, are new to the subject of blackpowder and you'd like to gain knowledge from a book rather than trail and error, then you don't have much choice. Suck it up and read on... not unpleasant, just verbose."
3,So-so book,"Your opinion of this book will depend on your other resources. If you don't have the time and/or access to the Internet, this book will go a long way to helping you get started in black powder shooting. If you have time to lurk in some of the blackpowder chat rooms, and to read other on-line resources, you'll get more, newer and specific information for free. The writing is clear but gets a bit repetitive at times, and there were too many commercials for certain products in the text for my tastes. If you can get this book from your local library, check it out first to better decide if its worth your money. I probably would not have bought it if my local library carried it."
2,Poor organization,"The main problem with this book is it is very poorly organized. The information seems to have been cut and pasted from various articles, with a very weak link of information within chapters. Many times, there are Pictures with captions in Chapters which have nothing to do with the subject of that chapter.Some sections are completly useless and somewhat elitist in terms of information. For example, in many cases, the information is of the order ""The powder horn is easy to use, so no explaination is necessary"".I would not recommend this book as a reference to blackpowder shooting, as the information you would be looking for is too difficult to locate."
2,Sorely dissappointed,"Not even close to what I was anticipating!!! Having read some of the reviews about this being a family movie, and generally loving ""older"" movies, I decided to give it a go... only to find, to my great, disappointment, it is not a family movie at all! About an old-fashioned [dysfunctional] family who rent a house on the beach for a Summer.... considering the cast, this movie had so much potential to be hilarious, clean, and entertaining.... and unfortunately, it failed greatly! Mr. Hobbs let off a number of swear words, there were a number of adult themes including, infidelity & divorce, which were the bulk of the movie. Additionally, the movie was very slow moving, and even lacked great acting at times (surprising considering the great names that comprise the cast). Overall very disheartening!"
1,disapointed,"the movie makes ""acceptable"" many things I would not compromise on as a Christian father/husband. Few awkward points in the movie dealing with inappropriate situations between Mr. Hobbs and other women. Makes light of 11 year old boy reading playboy magazine. Expected a lot more out of this movie with the actors listed."
1,Not a family movie,"We watch an ""older"" movie each weekend during the summer with our kids (ages 4-14). Having read some of the reviews about this being a family movie we gave it a shot. It is not a family movie. Mr. Hobbs let off a number of swear words, there were a number of ""adult themes"" including divorce and infidelity which were the bulk of the movie. In addition, the movie was very slow. If you are a Jimmy Stewart fan, you might enjoy, but otherwise, I'd recommend other choices."
1,Fatigue Acting,James Stewart was much better in westerns and in his classic Frank Capra movies. He just seemed worn out in this movie.
5,A wonderful family film,"Jimmy Stewart is the loving father that just can't quite get a handle on all of the things going on in his family, a part he has played more that once but to perfection in this film.The family vacation in an old ramshackle beach house sets up poor Jimmy to endure one miss-adventure after another usually instigated by one of his many children. Of course his beautiful wife, Maureen O'Hara, is there to ease him through it all and it all works out in the end.I love this film and laugh out loud at so many of the great bits especially the piece with John McGiver and Marie Wilson."
4,Not bad...,"I'd have a hard time rating this 5 stars. I've seen way too many Jimmy Stewart classics to rank this with them. However, this is definitely amusing.I found this to be somewhat of an awkward blend of 50's innocence and 60's ""not so innocence."" There were a couple of allusions to more adult themes, but these were packaged up with a pretty bow in an early family ""vacation"" movie.Setting aside some of the very real-life frustrations, there are some genuinely funny parts. When Mr. Hobbs was on his ""bird spotting"" adventure, I couldn't stop laughing!Overall, I would not say there are oodles of laugh-out-loud places, but there are enough amusing places that this becomes an enjoyable comedy."
3,Mr. Hobbs takes a Vacation,"Jimmy Stewart and Maureen O""Hara , push the envelope as parents in this typical 60,s era film. It has it funny moments but not there best work."
4,"sure, times change, but nothing's different","here we are in the 2000's, watching a movie about a middle American family from the 60's taking a vacation to the Pacific coast, his teen age kids his older daughters,a grandchild, the sons in laws, and all the emotions that go along with getting away with the family that you've gotten away from over the years."
4,Entertaining,"A month-long seaside vacation should be a time of ease and relaxation. Not so for Mr Hobbs. There is a crisis at every turn, dealing with misbehaving grandchildren, an unhappy teenager, a television addict son or trying to entertain two important, but very boring guests. With Jimmy Stewart as Mr. Hobbs and lovely Maureen O'Hara as Mrs. Hobbs, the trials are handled with humor and delight. Don't miss this one."
4,MR HOBBS TAKES A VACATION,This is a good funny movie for the whole family about a family that goes on a vacation to relax in an old house on the ocean and has nothing but bad luck with the house and the family but dispite it all the family comes together and becomes closer. this is from the 1960's and has always been one of my favorites.
4,A most enjoyable fare!,"This is not a trip to Wally World but a rather pleasant look at that family summer vacation taken back in the 1960's without the ""dirty dancing"". All in all an amiable movie, especially for fans of James Stewart and Maureen O'Hara.Fans of Jack Webb's ""Dragnet""; keep an eye out for ""Blue Boy""."
4,a couple of old smoothies on the loose,"I really like this movie. Stewart is perfectly cast, and his voice-overs masterful in providing the ironic commentary on the events as they unfold. The scenes between O'Hara and Stewart are flawless (""What did you tell him I had? Dementia Praecox?"") -- you don't get to see sophisticated, funny, and warmly affectionate parents in movies lately, and watching them together is a pleasure. Not only are they real pros, but they are obviously having fun together. I just wish that we could have seem more of them as couple, and a lot less of the teenagers.If you liked the movie you might enjoy the book, too. The tone is similar, but lots of details are different, and I found the humor a bit understated and the protagonist less likable than Stewart's character."
4,Enjoyable family movie.,"My family and I thought this was a very fun movie. Unlike those reviewers who thought it wasn't a ""family film"", we certainly thought it was. Very nice movie!!"
5,Great Movie! A classic!,I've always loved this movie. It a good clean fun movie about families. It was from a time when things were much simpler. I enjoyed watching this and getting away from the rat race for an hour. It's funny. Jimmy Stewart and Maureen O'Hara are hilarious.
3,Ok for what it is,"Even though I like alot of James Stewart's movies I was some what dissapointed in this one. I found it ho-hum & not really funny as I had read in one review before purchasing. It lacked something. This one doesn't come close to the classic of ""Harvey"".The visual quality of the movie is very good. casing could do with improving as it is thin & flimsy. The front plastic cover has cut out parts which I feel is a problem sometimes in the shipping as I have had a couple of broken discs in past orders with these types of casings."
5,Another Fun Movie....,"Again, wasn't born yet when it was made, but it's such fun and funny. I enjoy watching it whenever I feel the mood."
5,One of my all-time favorite comedies!,"I just HAVE to see this movie every summer (and any other time I feel like laughing)! It is one of my all-time favorite movies. James Stewart's acting is superb; his reaction to everything that befalls him, is SO funny!! Him toting in all of the heavy luggage by himself; his reaction to Marika's low-cut bathing suit; his special way of walking for bird-watching; and, of course, his getting locked in the bathroom with Marie Wilson! I just LOVE this movie!! I can watch it over & over!!!"
4,this is romance!,"Sweet,cool, and lovely.sorta like a coastful ride with your favorite lover.this cd screams of passion and mature balance! oscar woos the listener with sentimental and often sweet aggression, I enjoyed it immensely."
5,Excellent,His songs are slow but the music is excellent and he has a great voice. Excellent for comforting moments!
5,buen albun para reflexion,me gusta este album mucho y lo recomiendo a los que quieran adorar a Dios como lo hace marcos vidal
1,Only answers odd questions.....,"Since the description of the book is NONEXISTANT, I just wanted to make it known that the solution guide only has solutions to the odd numbered exercises - no evens. It also does not work out each odd one either. With the odd numbers' answers in the back of the accompanying textbook, this solution guide (with only a few worked out solutions, all in a large font size making it seem like a big book) is not worth my time or money."
3,Chin Bath,Nice and sturdy but too small for a dust bath. My chin is 9 years old and has gained some weight over the years and he can hardly get in and out of it.
3,I didn't get what I ordered!!!!,"I ordered the ceramic chinchilla bath and they sent me a plastic one. I could of got a plastic one for alot cheaper but I spent the extra to get a long lasting durable ceramic one, and I still recieved a plastic one! I'm pretty upset, I believe you should get what you pay for and then they want me to go through the trouble of sending it back when I cant figure out where to send it and I shouldnt have to deal with it they made the mistake they should fix it. I hate when you order one thing and get the cheaper version, it's not right. I want a ceramic chinchilla bath which is listed on my reciept and this website. So be careful what you buy, you might get jipped just like me."
5,keeps getting better!!!!!!,"I own fifa 2005, and I my only complaint was that there wasn't a quick simulation, this year that has changed. I have only had this game for a few days and have been playing it non-stop. It is a huge upgrade from last year. PROS: improved graphics.....very deep manager mode.....great gameplay. CONS:none."
2,Where are the real improvements?,"We are all still waiting for real GAMEPLAY improvements to the FIFA series. There was a small improvement from 04 to 05. However, control seems to have taken a reverse in 06. I am sorrily dissappointed with the 06 FIFA product. FIFA 05 has less glitches. I just bought FIFA 06 last week but have been playing FIFA 05. I don't know who EA are hiring to design their product but I could probably do a better job -[...]. You guys need to start over from the ground up."
2,don't waist your money,"fifa soccer 2006 is is an exceptionaly good game,but don't spent money on it. well there may be a lot of cool features like manager mode this game if far from 5 stars. it lacks control. for example you can not control were the ball will go when you pass or when you shoot it, and there are to many controls. the grafix are ok for such a complicated game but i have seen better (much better). so if you are looking for a good soccer game get Red Card 2003 by midway sports, ot fifa street. they are a lot more fun."
3,"Pretty book, useful to learn but not to help you travel","This is a nice book to own and to use at home, but not a book I'd use valuable backpack real estate to tote on a trip. It will give you good background on the history, geaography, and culture of the country and has better pictures than the other guides, but isn't strong on telling you where to eat, what route to use, where to stay, how to get along. I bought mine to show people what Chile is like, and it's great for that."
4,From an ex-Lonely Planet reader,"What's the first thing you want to know about a country? Why do I want to visit. For answering this question Insight guides do an excellent job. Interesting descriptions complemented by pictures get you interested in Chile and what the country has to offer. Comparably Lonely planet guides are like a phone book. There is more information in them - often out of date - but little effort or detail is put in about the features of the country itself. My only problem with Insight is that its informational section is lacking. My suggestion is read insight, determine where and when you want to visit and then seek out up to date information on hotels, etc. from another source."
4,"Deep historical review, quality pictures, helpful","Quality handbook that includes nice historical depth, perspective and quality images. The review of the Pinochet regime, however, unfortunately comes off as stock socialist perspective. I lived through this period as an ex-pat in Chile and the author's bias is clearly evident."
1,Rip off,Who in there right mind would spend that kind of money on a switch that you can get at Home Depot for .59.
4,peef is very enjoyible,I think peef is a lovable charecter in a loveable book. makes you wish all your stuffed animals were like peef!!!
2,Screwed on shipping,"The book is great. My son loved it. Sadly though, it was ordered with the guarantee that it would arrive before Christmas, and it showed up on the 26th. Amazon has been non-responsive and has ignored my correspondence (e-mail & snail mail). So, I would recomend buying the book, just not through Amazon."
5,FAMILY TRADITION - will surely become a favorite in your household too,"So cute and you must buy the ""Peef"" books to understand the meaning. They'll make adults cry and children laugh. Even though my kids are 19 and 20 now, Peef has become a holiday tradition and a treasured holiday memory. Perfect for any child, even us adults who still have a child's heart! A great way to start a holiday tradition with your children, grandchildren or any special little one in your life. My children were given a ""Peef"" when they were three and now I'm continuing the tradition by giving this gift to my young niece."
3,Exactly as Described,"I ordered three sets for my various ladders. These fit two of the ladders quie nicely, but one of the ladders it is too large to fit properly. I am still using them, but they are loose and fall off the ladder sometimes"
4,Ladder Covers,"Covers are great. If they were a little softer, wouldn't cause marks on walls. I would recommend them to anyone."
3,"Just received, should be OK.","OK, ad confusing. Says ""Need two"" so I did. Received TWO, 2 sets, 4 pieces, two packages of quantity of 2 (two) in each package.CONFUSING. I better not receive 4 (four) ladder jacks. Need TWO only of that item also. Bob Porter"
1,Slip Off,These mitts always slip off my ladder. I had to buy a different brand that work much better. These were a waste of money.
5,Um... Covers. Blue.,"Non-slip, non-marking covers for a ladder. I tried bubble wrap and duct tape. This works much better. Don't be a cheapskate."
4,Good....but overpriced,"Menards has the EXACT same thing in yellow for a bit over 6 dollars. Same package, same mold. I can't knock the review because of the price, they perform well. Just wish I had looked at Menards first."
2,Didn't fit my MT-22,"I tried to get these on my MT-22 ladder, but I couldn't get them to fit. I tried soapy water, but still managed to get it only about half way on. If I continued to work on it maybe I could have gotten them to slip all the way on, but I gave up. I ended up wrapping the end of the ladder with a shop towel and duct-taping it into place.I saw that another reviewer here said he cut slits up the side to help them fit better.I'm sure if I had gotten them on they would have worked well, and they definitely seem durable."
3,Not made for MT-22,"It would be nice if Werner had a larger one to fit better. I made it work, though. See my comment to MacLabDoug above."
1,"Great heart, no mind","A good-hearted book - unfortunately it was so poorly argued, trite and repetitive, that it did a disservice both to its subject and feelings. Women need a balance between the mind and the heart, and this kind of gushing nonsense does not help us to change ourselves, or the world. If you want a good, intelligent and heart-felt feminine take on the world, read Clarissa Pinkola Estes's Women Who Run With the Wolves."
2,Hmphf.,"I haven't read this book, to be honest. Yet, knowing that Marianne Williamson touts ""A Course in Miracles"" as the source of her spiritual guidance, how does she justify ""a woman's worth"" and prayer to a ""goddess"" when the Course specifically states that we are not bodies, and that the sole source of our illusion of a world is the idea of separation? Did she even read the Course? ""A Return to Love"" was incredibly inconsistent with Course teachings. She does NOT paraphrase accurately. While I think it's wonderful that her books bring more joy into peoples' lives, please read the Course yourself. Don't rely on Marianne for an interpretation."
1,WHERE IS IT... It has not arrived.. been over a month!,I would love to read it... but it has yet to arrive!It's been over a month!
5,Essential reading,"This well documented yet understated book chronicles how the United States veered away from freedom into a kind of benevolent despotism. The book will change the way you think about the so-called ""free world"".There is no tabloid journalism here, only well researched documentary detailing how secrecy and power can derail even the most well meaning governments.There are five massive volumes about the artist Jackson Pollack, none of which mention his involvement with the CIA. If nothing else read this book for information you won't easily find elsewhere."
4,Brazilian president FHC was a CIA's man,"I read this good book, in a translation to the portuguese, here in Brazil.One great part of this book is to show that brazilian former President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso(FHC), was a CIA's man more than twenty years before he became a brazilian president.This book is biased.""Uncle Sam"" gave money to persons such as FHC, but at the same time, Fidel Castro was giving money to persons, such as Che Guevara or Leonel Brizola."
4,not bad compilation,"Sound of this is moderate to ok,But lil red riding hood sounds like a record vynl,you could hear the crackling if you listen closely."
5,Let's Do The Time Warp Again,"The new Happy The Man album sounds just as delightful as their two Arista releases from 1977-8. It's almost as if that whole ugly three decades in between just vanished.Except I'm still 50, dammit."
5,A Delight to The Ears and to the Soul!!,"A fantastic recording, perfectly recorded. I can listen to this recording over and over. It is right up there with my favorite Camel and Renaissance albums. Buy or download this now!"
3,Lots of Romantic Authors,"Very densly packed book with many many English Romantic authors. Font is just large enough to read comfortably, and the book is organized well."
1,Deceptive title for a book that rehashes the same old stuff,"This book has just recently been published but you would never know it from the content. It's very introductory material with little content that isn't already on the web for free. In fact the coverage on the web is probably better that what the author has provided. Simple descriptions of indicators that have been around forever like RSI, moving averages, trendlines etc. You get the idea. It's hard to understand why Luca felt it necessary to cover this stuff. Much better books were written 20 years ago. It's simply a shallow attempt to get some bucks from those that buy a book by the author's name or title. Waht amazes me even more is that the publisher somehow thinks this book should be listed at $65. What a joke. Luckily I bought this one at a local book seller and returned it the next day."
2,Cheating on readers,"1. Many lines are direclty copied from ""trading global currency market"".2. Did not proof read. There are many typos, so confusing.3. Does not explain details when they are needed.4. Lacks explanations for figures. Figures spread all over the book, somewhere I think they don't match text.This guy, Luca, seems to be famous. He is maybe good at trading himself and he is able to write a good book, but he just did not put himself into it."
2,Good info; horrible writing.,"The author clearly knows his subject. Unfortunately, he has a hard time communicating it effectively. First, the sample charts lack the simple annotations that would make his comments easy to understand. Next, it seems no one proof read the book since there are obvious grammatical errors, and even technical errors where he apparently wanted to say one thing but said the opposite. Finally, I guess the book wasn't even spell checked, as there are words such as ""currrent"" included.The book is not useless, but I suspect there are better."
2,"An okay read, but fun.","The fun of this book is the main characters of Rep and Melissa and the itinerary references. The weakness is and that, at times, the literary references occasionally seem forced and get in the way of the story, and the complete implausibility of the plot. But it's worth a look if you're in the mood for something light that will test your memory of literature."
2,a bit far-fetched,Both good & bad guys didn't behave with much sense & the literary allusions were a bit forced. So I cannot recommend it.
2,"Excellent music, but don't support this band",I was a HUGE fan of NST until last week when the band kicked out one of its founding members after he told the band that his wife was pregnant.
3,"Good anthology, not so great presentation","This book contains a very good selection of Blake's most important and beautiful texts, and I have enjoyed reading it very much. My only complain is the quality of the paper which is very low, like mass-market paperback it resembles newspaper in texture and smell. There is a section of the book that reproduces some of his engravings in black and white, which is but a shadow of Blake's grandiose visual imagery.If you want to sample some of this authors work on a budget, to see if you like it, then this book may be for you. But for Blake lovers there are better volumes, of complete works, some of them illustrated in color. That's what I will be purchasing next."
2,So disappointed,Jennifer Crusie novels are not the appropriate place for the technical specifications of a 9mm semiautomatic handgun. I loved all the Crusie novels before this one because the dialogue is so witty it made me laugh out loud. Not this book. There's one cute line from the child in the story and that's it. I can't believe Bob Mayer messed up Crusie's writing this much. It was a waste of time.
2,Ms. Crusie...keep writing solo.,"I am a huge fan of Jennifer Crusie books. I've read almost all of them, and really enjoyed them, albeit some more than others. But compared to her other books, this was awful. It was choppy. It didn't flow at all. About 3 chapters from the end they throw in a character's name that they had never previously discussed. Several times I even found grammar errors in the writing. My advise to Ms. Crusie: please ditch Bob Mayer and continue to write solo. My advise to the readers: read some of her other books. They are awesome (esp. Bet Me, Fast Women, Welcome to Temptation)!"
2,Shocker from a Brand Name Author!,"Holy cow--I trusted this author and bought a HARDBACK book--me-- who doesn't even buy trade paperbacks because of the higher costand was I tricked! Jennifer Cruise is a great author and having read all of her books, at least one is always at the ready to read at the end of that rotten day for a happy ending. I don't know who THIS GUY is she felt she needed to write with, but he brings little to the party, but, I suspect, a higher cover price. Any of her books are a much better choice than this foolish story that perpetuates the worst stereotypes about ""romance"" books. One of the most annoying components was the deluge of characters introduced solely by dialogue in thefirst 50 or so pages. That meant I had to constantly flip back and forth through the pages to see who was saying what to whom! Grrr! Buy three of her earlier paperbacks for what you spend on this hardback and have a much better time. This book is a mess!"
2,Don't waste your money on this one...,"I automatically buy anything Jennifer Crusie and devour it...but I had to make myself read this one just because I paid for it on my Kindle. Usually her characters make her books, but I couldn't make myself like any of these characters, except for the 5-year-old, and I was actually pretty concerned about her. The male character is a jerk who sleeps with the first female who offers, and then does the ""love of his life"" character a couple days later. I'm still not really sure what happened in the book, and I have yet to figure out the motives of the bad guys. I wish I would have chosen differently...this is just not a good book and I wish I would have just cut my losses instead of wasting my time as well."
1,Yuk - bad bad bad bad,"Their other books rock - this one tanks. Its the price you pay to get the good ones (I think this was their first). Having improved, they should write more now. This series grows on you - Agnes is just dead on fun but the amusement park one grows on you - they should write more on that series of characters - there was more there to develop. (You know, just in case they were bored & needed ideas!)"
3,Don't Look Down,"I didn't like this book as much as I liked Agnes and the Hitman. It was fast paced and fairly good, but it was easy for me to put it down and come back to it later"
2,Ridiculous book - quite a disappointment,Don't waste your time on this book. Unlikeable characters and terrible plot. I forced myself to finish the book by skimming the last half.
3,Take it or leave it,"I'm a huge Crusie fan, and I knew from her yahoo group that she'd been working on a collaboration with Mayer. I was actually excited about seeing her go in a new direction. But this book was so not what I expected. What Crusie does best is create real female characters who aren't perfect but are interesting and lovable and funny. Lucy was those things, from the little we got to see of her. Honestly, though, there was just so much constantly going on in this book that it was hard to care about any of the characters at all. For example, chapter one introduces almost all the major players; one of my favorite characters from the chapter was Gloom, Lucy's gay best friend. We hardly see him again in the book- very disappointing. Overall, it's fine for a beach read but don't expect the same quality you're used to from Crusie. It's just not there."
1,Don't waste your time or your money on this tripe,"I am a big Jennifer Crusie fan, and tend to enjoy action/adventure novels, so was delighted to see she'd teamed up for a joint venture that combines romance with action.However, after painfully making my way through this sodden mess, I have to say I am bitterly disappointed with the outcome. We got neither a good romance nor a believable, fast-paced action story. What we got was the worst of both writers -- perhaps there were territoriality tussles or they each agreed to edit the other's work -- I can just see it:Jennifer: ""Wait Bob, that's a coherent sentence! Here, let me rework it for you!""Bob: ""NO way can a character be both intelligent AND sexy -- here, let me dumb her down a bit for you.""I understand they've collaborated on a second book (an excerpt was included in this one), and it actually sounds a lot better. I'd suggest that you focus on Crusie's other excellent books, if you're looking for something smart, sassy, and well written."
2,Jennifer Crusie Romance,"You know, I pretty much like all Jennifer Crusie books; but this one had small children in it. I've got 2 children but they are grown. Not really interested in having them in a romance novel."
3,Vanilla Ice Cream + Chocolate Syrup=Sundae or Sludge?,I had a great deal of trouble getting into this book. Jennifer Crusie is famous for her wonderful opening sentences and gripping first chapters. I did not find that here. What I did find was characters with great possibilities that never got fully developed and a story line that wasn't especially clear or interesting. The old Crusie sparkle and sassy characters just aren't here.
3,Spunky and fun,"Ok, so the plot wasn't great. By the end, I found myself shrugging and saying, ""meh, whatever,"" about most of the plot details.But the real fun part about this book was the characters. I really think the interplay between male and female worked well. In romances especially, it's hard to get the male point of view, I suspect because most romance writers are female (and even if they aren't, are trying to appeal to the female demographic). I enjoyed reading the male point of view portions of the book, and watching macho macho man fall in love. I didn't think it was doable, but it worked for me. Heck, I fell in love with him, nevermind the heroine in the novel.This was the first book I've read by either Crusie or Mayer, but now I'll be looking forward to their next collaborative effort and probably thumbing through their backlists."
2,Very Disappointed,"I so looked forward to receiving and reading this book as I'm a big fan of Crusie and also action and supense. Having the two combined should have made for a good book. Boy, was I disappointed. The first disappointment was the character of JT (the hero??) He was so one dimensional. The heroine, Lucy, was a better written character. Being an avid reader of romance novels, I was especially disappointed to find JT going to bed with another woman even after he had met Lucy. That really spoiled the book for me right off and made me dislike JT's character from the beginning. It just got more disappointing after that as the plot was not at all plausable. Crusie has always written witty and likeable characters in the past. I thinks she needs to stay with her previous winning formula."
1,Save Your Money,"This is a lousy book. Choppy writing, jumps around and uses the ""f"" word on every other page - not what you'd expect from Jennifer Cruise. I am highly disappointed."
1,dont look down,i love jennifer crusie but i was really disappointed in this one I've read better from her. it was miss alot
3,Confusing and cartoonish,"I have mixed feelings about this. First, the audio production I listened to was really odd, with the different male/female points of view and male/female dialog done by different narrators (male for male, female for female, of course). It was a little jarring at times, and I think it contributed to the outrageousness of the story. The plot is weak and unnecessarily confusing (I'm still not entirely certain what was going on in the end), and characters are so over-the-top they border on cartoonish. I guess this could be good or bad, depending on your point of view. I'd read more from Crusie, but I might shy away from this particular combination of authors in the future."
1,***HORRIBLE***,"First, let me say this -- my review is for the book, not the seller, product, or transaction. Seller was great, as was the experience. It's just a really convoluted book, and a very poorly done audio version. The male lead sounds like he's standing in a closet shouting all his lines through the door. I didn't even make it through the second disc before I gave up on it. I love Jennifer Crusie normally, but this one was bad."
2,totally confused by the first chapter?,"When this book first came out, I jumped at the chance to buy it. I love Jennifer Crusie. By the end of the first chapter, I was so confused, I put it down for over a year. I decided to try one more time and I did get through the first chapter of who said what to whom,but the second wasn't much better. The characters still remained, so confusing to me. So far I haven't finished it but I am going to struggle through and try to get to the end. So having said that, I am going to buy their next book anyway and see if that one is better. To finish I have to agree with most of the other reviews, what were they thinking? I hate putting any book down and especially Ms. Crusie's books but I honestly just didn't get it. Maybe it was the team thing and they have to get it all together first. I think we should give them the benefit of the doubt and try them again. But I have loved your other books Ms. Crusie! Thanks you!!"
2,Too techical,I was disappointed in this book because it lacked a lot of the light-heartedness we have come to expect from Crusie and had too much technical info re: guns and explosives (an attempt to appeal to male readers?). I would read more by this team but hope they will not be so stereotypical in future.
1,Mediocre at best,"I have been a huge Crusie fan and have read all her other books. I was really looking forward to this book and was very disappointed. The book dragged on and I was not terribly interested right up to the end. The character of Lucy was OK, but the little bits of background we were told had nothing to do with the characters behavior. The hero was a piece of cardboard who slept around. His only redeeming trait was when he interected with Pepper, the 5 year old niece of Lucy. The other characters were never developed and there were just too many of them. All in all, the book was poorly written and the authors should forget all future collaborations.If you still want to read this book, check it out from the library - don't waste your money."
2,Don't bother!,"I've read all Crusie's books and they're light hearted humor usually delivers a punch; along with delving into the characters' weaknesses, ultimately reserecting their strengths, that readers can identify with. This book had none of the saving graces. I was left dissapointed - serving up forced humor and characters that are surface level with an ending that is so unrealistic that one wonders why the time was spent to finish the book. I kept reading hoping somewhere along the line that the Crusie-style would resurface .... it did not."
3,A tad confused,"Because I love Jennifer Crusie so much, I'm not capable of giving her a bad review. I've decided that I must be ADD. I couldn't fully get into this story because so much is happening at the same time. I got confused. At the beginning of the story there are so many characters emerging, so much dialogue happening at the same time (is she saying it to the person on the phone, or the person in front of her or what) and so much action, I got lost. I love my Crusie. I like her light romance and humor, including the light suspense she's merged into the plot, but this particular book was definitely heavy in a military/action story. It reads like one of those Delta Forces action movie NOT as a thriller. We clearly know who the bad guys are, quite stereotyped. BUT I did fall in love with the hero. Just not my cup of tea. I don't consider it a thriller, just an ""action movie"". Will wait for the next Crusie avidly."
3,Good humored Jennifer Crusie,"I hope you enjoyed this novel DON'T LOOK DOWN by Jennifer Crusie. I found it breezy yet humorous, a fun chicklit read, definitely. I wished some of the character lines would have been more developed. Sometimes you are just looking for a fun read and this is it. Not my favorite Cruisie novel, but OK, worth the read. I have given this novel 3 stars to prove that Crusie has a great sense of humor and the storyline is engaging, but the characters were a bit lacking and so she did not receive all 5 stars from me. Still fun though!!"
3,Next!,"Do yourself a favor and read Agnes and the Hitman instead...Its Crusie/Mayers next book, and I am glad to say they have better honed their skills in it. Dont Look Down has potential, but somehow gets boring and loses the thrill 2/3 through."
1,Crusie may want to rethink collaboration......,"with Bob Mayer. Known for her intelligently funny, character driven, deftly plotted romantic novels, Crusie is all but invisible in this boring, schizophrenic, badly written attempt at romantic mystery with a dash of comedy thrown in.As other reviewers have pointed out, Don't Look Down is disjointed and lumbering, with dull, largely unbelievable and poorly motivated characters, and an outlandish plot. The writing is repetitive, amateurish and at times downright irritating (italized inner thoughts appear with annoying regularity). After the first chapter or two, I skimmed the remainder, hoping something would catch my eye and make me want to actually READ this book. Never happened.I've read and enjoyed most if not all of Crusie's books (Faking It, Bet Me, Fast Women, etc.) but if her future books are collaborations with Mr. Mayer, I believe I'll move on."
1,Not the fun witty girl we know!,"I love Crusie's witty, sassy, feminine books, and hated this one! What's with all the army, guns, macho stuff - Ugh! The only decent line in the whole book was when Lucy says, ""I just don't understand how you guys got control of the world. Half the time there's no blood in your brains, and you're still in charge of most of the governments in the world, most of the companies, and all of the military. Which actually explains a lot, now that I think of it.""Please Ms. Crusie, drop Mr. Mayer and go back to writing what you do best. Fun, witty modern romance with interesting characters we actually care about.All in all a very uneven, not fun book. Don't waste your money!"
