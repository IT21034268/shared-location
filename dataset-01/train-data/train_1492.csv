4,3-DVD Set Misleading to 7-VHS Set Owners?,"The 3-DVD set contains three full episodes, however, they are split into 7 ""Parts"" (two episodes at two parts each, one episode at three parts) which may be confused with the original 7-tape set. Or are there indeed seven full episodes in the first season? (I would rate this 5-stars, but first seasons generally are not as good as later seasons, and being a fan of CRACKER starting later in the series, I was a little underwhelmed by the first three episodes.)"
1,Deffective: disc 3 missing an episode,"As a previous reviewer has noted, disk three - ""One Day a Lemming Will Fly"" - has only the first two episodes and is missing the third. So before buying it, make sure you can return it."
1,"lame, cliched and predictable.","it was simply not possible to become engaged with either the characters or the plot. the plot was a string of cliched and predictable ""developments"" and the characters were two dimensional. If I could give a 1/2 star, I would."
4,CRACKER Series 1,"I just finished watching the first series of BBC's CRACKER, a detective series featuring a quirky psychologist with plenty of personal problems himself. The first episode, I wasn't sure what I thought of this show but by the 3rd episode I was hooked. The main characters become well known to you, and you begin to wonder ""will CRACKER solve his maritial problems, will he succumb to an affair?"" ""Will the Female Detective be able to compete in her largely male dominated profession?"" ""Will CRACKER'S son finally be able to adapt to a Real world?"" ""Will the Lead Detective, a new Dad, take to Fatherhood?"" And so on. Plus the story lines of murder and mayham are good too. A different approach than I've seen, but an entertaining series. Definitely adult fare without being overly explicit or just throwing in sex or violence that don't quite fit the storyline."
4,Why do birds sing so gay?,"This is a fine collection of 20 of Frankie Lymon's best songs, with and without the Teenagers. Frankie had a great voice, before it changed. In retrospect, it was a mistake to break him away from the Teenagers as a solo artist, but what are you gonna do? The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and here you have all their important recordings. What more do you want?"
3,"Yes to the band, no to the singer","I am mystified by reviewers' ecstatic comments about 'Dancing in the Dark."" As many have noted, the musicianship on this CD is sensitive and beautiful. No singer could ask for better. Unfortunately, the singer--at least based on the evidence presented here--is a performer of modest gifts who is pleasant enough to listen to but doesn't take the material anywhere it hasn't been before, many times before.Anybody in the market for a hardly-played Tierney Sutton CD?"
2,Carrying a Concept Too Far,"This CD is disappointingly one-dimensional. Every song is presented at about 1/2 (or less) the tempo at which these songs are normally sung. While it can be interesting to sing a song at an unexpected tempo on occasion, Ms. Sutton's decision to give nearly every song on this album exactly the same treatment results in mind-numbing monotony. As much as I love her beautiful voice, I find this CD almost impossible to listen to all the way through. I'm glad this was not the first Tierney Sutton CD I heard, or I would be convinced that she is incapable of any range or creativity."
1,Imitation interpretations,"In this recording Tierney Sutton offers up a tantalizing collection of songs, a tribute to Frank Sinatra's moody, introspective side. Too bad the performance doesn't match the material. Her little-girl voice moves through stretched, clipped, and oddly distorted ""interpretations"" of lyrics, offering neither new insights nor convincing expression, but rather drawing attention to a conscious effort to sound different. The very pronounced piano obbligatos by Christian Jacob seem to veer between watered-down Erroll Gardner and Bobby Short, while the string choir offers not much more than very muted, simple scales that contribute irrelevant backgrounds. Is this a CD to acquire? Only if the songs you want aren't available in other versions."
2,"Sadly, I was not inspired..","It honestly pains me to write a plain review.. as it were, ""damning by faint praise"" I guess, however, I just felt very let down by Ms. Sutton's ""Dancing in the Dark"" album. Though it is not terrible, nor hurtful to the ears, I couldn't help but feel very indifferent after listening to it a few times. Ms. Sutton certainly has a musical gift, but nothing NEAR the level of Diana Krall or Stacey Kent, just to name a few. Please excuse the layman's terms, but I will say this: If you enjoy a very ""voicy"", drawn-out, sans instrumental style of jazz, then you perhaps would like this album. If you prefer a jazz sound containing a more balanced mix of vocals and instruments (such as the afore mentioned Krall & Kent), then I would stay away from this album. It really just boils down to a personal flavor I suppose. Peace. :-)"
2,The CD is OK,"All I can say about Ms. Tierny is that she has a nice, mellow voice, but songs that can be sung in 3 minutes take her 5 minutes. She drags out all of the songs on this CD. I was very disappointed that I paid money for music to sleep to!"
4,sultry singer,love Tierney Sutton's voice. can't understand why she isn't more popular. she is fantastic! I have 3 of her albums. this one is a like sitting in a jazz night club.
1,Don't buy this product,MS built-in VPN server crashes all the time in spite of updating to the latest firmware. I also experienced a huge lag time on using my remote access connections through this router.
1,slow tech support,"The VPN functionality does not work as advertised. I attempted PPTP but was not able to access LAN. Wasted many hours trying to get the problem resolved. Opened a case with Trendnet but they called me back in 4 days instead of the 2 days they promised. Once they do reply, they're not bad. One of the few companies that are still using onshore tech support (at least for the VPN part). The product guide is sketchy and does not contain problem solving help for this particular problem. The website has some FAQs but also does not address this problem. I managed to get the remote desktop to work. Still working with tech support on accessing the LAN. I nearly gave up on them. Let's see if they can get my problem resolved. They had me upgrade the firmware to version 2."
1,"Has some charm, but in desperate need of grammar help","I agree with the other reviewer, this seems more like an attempt to translate the first Harry Potter novel into something for younger readers than any original story. But it fails to do even that much. I was left with the impression that the author has a lot of good heart and potential, but that she needs to hone her writing skills in every area from punctuation to grammar to better use of description to an understanding that what she has done is complete plagiarism. She is a writer, but not yet ready to be published."
4,"A BRAVE, HONEST EXPLANATION!!","I thought that the hard work and thought given to this ""expose"" made it an honest interpretation of the present crisis in the Catholic Church. One certainly knows how this nun feels about it, and that is very refreshing. It is also a ""good read""."
2,yellow,"I found this nonfiction piece disappointing, ultrafeminist, very yellow, and slanted. Males are the enemy, and only females can save the church. She concluded her book with a greeting commonly used only by witches. Some Catholic, eh?"
3,Pope Karol,"While I found this book interesting and agree with some of the accusations, especially the Catholic Church in the Middle Ages, I find that this author is quite one-sided. I've have been aquainted with many priests and nuns in my lifetime (89 years)- I knew nmuch about them and always held them in high regard. One thing I think is obvious.....Jackowski wants to be the POPE!"
2,Sister Karol Has an Agenda,"Die-hard catholics will be disturbed by this book. It is obvious that Sister Karol has an agenda - to bring about a new Catholic Church ruled by the people, not the Pope.Sister is anti-Pope, anti-Vatican, anti-male-priests. I got the feeling that sister is painting all priests with the same brush.If you are anti-Pope, anti-male-priests, anti-rules, pro-gay, pro-women priests, you will love the book."
1,give me a break...,"This from the ""nun"" who wrote SISTER KAROL'S BOOK OF SPELLS AND BLESSINGS... What kind of leftist, liberation-theology wacko would seriously consider her opinion worth the paper its printed on?"
2,Short but deadly,"Writing is pedantic and the author seems to have to stretch to make the connection between narrative, law, and everyday life. I have a fairly large vocabulary, but the author sent me to the dictionary several times... The passages on narratives as a function of self-making and culture do not break any new ground, and there are probably other books that can more fully explore the importance of story-telling. Perhaps a good selection for lawyers or others who do not have a strong understanding of the functions of narrative."
5,"So unique, so wonderful","I caught the Kinks in concert for the first time on their Sleepwalker tour. Naturally I was hooked, so I quickly rushed out a bought a few of their albums. This album was so great. I remember one night coming home from a party, slapping my KOSS Pro 4aa headphones on, and listening to this album from start to finish. That was in 1976, and I'm still talking about it today. What more do I need to say. Still a great listen. Treat yourself to a Kinks album and see what great songwriting is all about."
4,"A fun rock sound, witty verses, timeless rock sound.","I first heard these songs in the 1970s and had to seek them out because I enjoyed them so much then. ""Education"" is hilarious and has a clean rock sound. The Kinks' Schoolboys in Disgrace CD ranks equal with Pink Floyd's - Dark Side of the Moon as a must for my collection."
3,"Pretty good, but no bonus tracks?","This was a pretty good album when it came out on CD the first time. It has aged well despite being another concept album from Davies and co. The sound is excellent as on other Velvel reissues, too. The only complaint I have is there are no bonus tracks. Couldn't they have taken one off another reissue and put it on this one. It would have made it more attractive to those who already have this Cd(tape? album?) Velvel has done a great job reissuing the later Kinks catalog (check out Muswell Hillbillies-the classic Kinks album). Now if we can just get Castle to reissue the Pye/Reprise CD's in the U.S."
3,Not a very serious recording,"Silly and some what unoriginal but entertaining. It seems the lyrics in ""No More Looking Back"" appear in several other Kinks songs. Also, ""The Hard Way"" sounds too much like the Who's ""Can't Explain."" Most of songs are catchy or include catchy parts. There is a prevailing ""Who gives a damn"" attitude on this album that makes the flaws more forgiving. The cliches are a sort of mockery of pop music and themselves."
2,One of the weakest Kinks 70's albums,"Ray wasn't in top form here. The melodies are weak and derivative, the lyrics, while occasionally witty, are, for the most part, pedestrian by Davies standards. Clearly, Ray was running out of ideas with this one. This was probably Ray's idea of a bad joke played on RCA(their current record company) which had been pressuring him to produce material in the ""glam rock"" format. SCHOOLBOYS sold poorly and deservedly so as the contempt for both the record company and, to some degree, the audience is kept bubbling just below the surface. The band would soon return to form with the superior SLEEPWALKER and MISFITS."
5,Wonderful Children's Bible!,"This NIrV Bible has been a great addition to our household. It is very easy to understand without changing the stories or context whatsoever. The pictures are unobtrusive, and additional facts and information are scattered throughout. The print is neither too large, nor too small. Amazon lists this version for ages 4-8, but I have to admit, I enjoy reading it. I think it can easily appeal to older kids as well. Having grown up with the King James Version, I find this Bible to help me better understand all of those little ""hmmm, what exactly does that mean?"" type questions. I wish I had had something like this when I was growing up. It helps make the Bible much more understandable. This makes a wonderful introduction to the Bible for small children, and helps older kids get a better understanding and handle on some of the more difficult to comprehend parts."
5,Great Childrens Bible,My son is 3 and half and I love reading this bible to him. It is on his level and it he gets more out of it. He likes the pictures. I like the memory verse things. It is great bible.
5,great bible,My son who is seven years old enjoys hearing the bible stories from this Bible before bed. I enjoy reading it also as an adult.
5,Not just for kids,"For a non-native English speaker, this is the perfect study Bible. The language is easy to understand without being childish or condescending.The study helps are fun and informative. The pictures are delightful."
4,very good Bible!!,"I have bought this Bible for all four of my children. It is a great Bible, but may create a problem when the child is given a memorization verse from Church and it isn't the same. Other than this, it has been a great Bible for my children."
5,The Word is understandable at any age.,"The Bible says, ""Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God"". This is an excellent Bible to get your children to start ""hearing"" the Word of God by reading it themselves. The translation is true to any good accurate translation, NKJ, NIV, ESV, NASB. We have many Bibles for out twin 5 year olds and this is by far the best though I would also highly recommend Egermeier's Bible Story Book for read aloud time.You can't get your children to start loving the Word of God soon enough and our kids love this Bible. They are easily able to find the various books and locating specific passages is becoming second nature. This is an excellent, excellent child's Bible."
5,bought for a Christmas gift,"Our 6-year-old grandson is very excited that he has his own bible that he can read by and large on his own. We sit with him for the bigger words and the names (there are adults we know who can't read those!), and he loves to read to us from it. It tracks well with the regular NIV, so when his teacher at church reads to the class, he can still easily follow along with his bible. We gave another copy to the son of a friend, and he, too, enjoys being able to see the scriptures written in a format he can understand. Anything that can encourage youngsters to read scriptures is a real blessing."
4,Great children's bible,I purchased this book for my son who is six years old. It's great because the words are easy to understand and there are great questions that gets him thinking about God. I would recommend this book to anyone with children.
5,Best Computer Accessory I Have!,This little book is the handiest address book I've ever seen. Many times I see web pages I want to check out - or come upon one while at the computer but time is limited - I list it in my book and when time permits surf away. Because it has room to list as much or as little information as you want it is very adaptable. I honestly would be lost without it! It has also been a lifesaver because I always put my passwords in it and who can remember all those without help? Whoever came up with the idea for this addressbook is a genius.
3,Fun Fun Fun,"This movie exceeded my expectations. It had a few good scares, several good laughs, and some hot chicks to top it off. It's not going to win any awards but I definitely enjoyed watching it. Check it out for yourself."
5,Love these bags! Great quality,"I have this bag and the laminated and I love them - one goes with the baby, one stays with me. Very well made - roomy, and organizes well. Would buy again and again"
4,Great bag for a cloth-diapered baby!,"This is a great bag for a cloth-diapered baby or multiples. It is very large with many pockets on both sides of the main compartment. The outside is stylish enough that it doesn't look like a diaper bag. The inside is lined in a lighter colored fabric so it makes it easy to find what I'm looking for even in low-light. I love that it has 4-feet on the bottom. The bag could be slightly more stiff as it does tend to be floppy. Otherwise, I anticipate using this bag for many years, even after my daughter is no longer in diapers because it is so roomy and stylish looking. My bag is the black background with brown fleur de lis print. One note - the shoulder straps are not adjustable. Just something to keep in mind if you are particular about where the bag may hit on your torso."
4,Great Bag for Travel,"I got this as a gift from some very sweet friends. It's great for traveling, and I use it as a carry-on bag (in addition to our real diaper bag, which is a backpack). It's roomy, has lots of pockets, and I love the additions it came with - the bottle bag, zippered internal bag and changing pad. I also like that the company is environmentally conscience, and that the bag is eco-friendly and Phthalate free. It also has straps on both ends, so you can securely attach it to your stroller."
4,very nice,"is a nice design, has much storage compartments. Diaper bag and hang time, the only thing is that it is big chunky"
3,It's okay,"I looked everywhere for a big diaper bag that looked nice. I thought that I had found the one. I loved it when I got it in the mail and could not wait to use it, it was not even a month of use and the zipper broke and then the sides starting coming apart. If i had to do it over again I would not spend 70 on something that is going to fall apart!"
4,I like it,"There isn't a whole lot of text in this book - only selected poems from Catullus, Tibullus, Sulpicia, Propertius, and Ovid. There are tons of notes and essays in the back, and to avoid reiteration of the previous review I'll add my own observations about the commentary.I'm an undergraduate in my seventh year of Latin (including pre-university work). I'm not fabulous at translation, so this is why I must complain. The commentaries are nice, but they rarely include help with the grammar or vocabulary. Sometimes the author goes into a pretty long explanation of references to mythology, other poems, or other literature. I'm not saying this isn't useful, but to have a little bit of grammatical explanation - which my teacher often disagrees with - and vocabulary help would have been more useful to me. This might be more of a book for a graduate student, but I enjoy it anyways."
2,Only for professional academics,"This is not nearly a ""complete course on Latin erotic elegy"", but an extended exercise in postmodern literary criticism, and next to useless for an undergraduate actually seeking to understand Latin erotic elegy."
1,Worthless,"$35 dollars for this book is ridiculous. All of the information is overly simplified, and is some areas plain wrong. Definitely not meant for ABO study material. The illustrations are so poor it's disgusting. They have pictures of different face types and they all look like unrecognizable blobs. Then when showing prism there wasn't even an effort. It literally has stick figure heads with a triangle over the eyes showing the different prism types. If you are a new optician learning the very basics this book will just be material you'll learn within your first week on the job and is definitely not worth the money."
3,"Great sounding cable, poor quality switch","I've had this cable for a few years now. It is a great sounding cable, really makes an audible difference. However, the switch slowly started getting worse and worse, causing crackles and pops while recording, and finally, whatever is going on inside the housing gave up the ghost. The lifetime guarantee only works fore really organized packrats (keep your receipt and know where it's at years later). I will buy another Planet Waves cable, but I won't be buying another PW-AGRA-20. I'll take this one in to get it resoldered to a fixed jack."
5,Really good cable for the money,"I bought this cable last November for our tour in South Asia. I also had an older one of the same kind that I had bought in 2004 that I just replaced using the lifetime warranty. I have gotten consistently good sound out of these cable, and the kill switch is a very nice add-on. I'd recommend this cable especially at the $30 price point."
1,Just try another cable,Don't waste your money in this cable... is cheap and is not realyable... Make a lot of noise... and... if your lucky will last two months..
5,The Best of All the Cables (and I reviewed them all),"I decided to buy every cable my local chain guitar/music store offered, including LW, PlanetWaves, Monster, and Mogami. I spent over $500 buying one of each cable, in every ""level"" (Entry, Intermediate, and Pro) that the store offered. I play an Epiphone Les Paul Custom Special Edition hooked via the cable to a Line 6 Spider IV 75W amp with a 1x12 Celestion speaker.Out of ALL the cables tested, this particular Planet Waves model was the best in terms of clarity, punch (bottom end), and sustain. Yes, it out-performs Monster and the $100 Mogami Platinum cable (made by Marshall). These PlanetWave cables are made by D'Addario, famous for their guitar/bass/etc strings.I highly recommend this model over Planet Waves' others, as their Classic, Custom, & Custom Pro cables do not offer the same clarity (close, but not the same); this is reflected on the back of their package under ""Signal Transparency."""
3,Pink Live At Wembley Arena,"Excellent DVD, except I ordered the ""Not Edited"" version and somehow recieved the ""Edited"" Version."
1,TERRIBLE!!!!!!,"Alright, first off im not a kid im just too lazy to go through the whole process for the other one. Now that thats cleared up back to the strings. THESE ARE TERRIBLE. The ball ends on the first 3 strings are just knots with little plastic things on em. Secondly, the higher strings stretch way too much. I was turning the knobs for what seemed like an hour only to find that they were still too flat. Finally, they dont stay in tune. I played lightly for about half an hour when i realized that they were out of tune. This might just be my guitar but whatever. Bottom line: DONT GET THESE"
1,Please don't buy it,I am very disappointed because the baby bracelet looks very different. I don't recommend to anybody. Please don't buy it. It doesn't worth $50.00
1,Be Careful,"Bought this pan to make an apple pie. The plan was to ""unmold"" the pie after it cooled. During the cooking process the juices of the pie leaked through the ""removable"" bottom of the pan, gluing the pan together. That sucked! Even after the pie had been eaten, I couldn't get that bottom to come loose. I soaked and soaked. Finally using brute force, I got that bottom disc to release. For my trouble, I cut two fingers on the sharp edge and bent the disc. The inside edge of the pan and the disc are Very Sharp, be careful. I don't know what to do to solve this problem with the pan, maybe line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper? Anyway, not very happy with this pan and it sure looks worse for wear after one time out."
5,"Finally, a complete novela","La Reina del Sur was one of the most exciting, fast paced and tightly plotted telenovelas ever aired. It has great acting, led of course by Kate del Castillo in the title role. There are no subtitles, and it's in Spanish, so you have to be fairly fluent to understand what's going on. The story is gripping, tracing the unexpected rise, fall and rebirth of a woman who never asked to be, but somehow turned out to be, a very powerful figure in the international drug trade. Even though she's a ""criminal"", the viewer has a lot of sympathy for her, as she has a strong internal moral code, and cares deeply about her friends. The original series ran 63 episodes, and all 63 are included in full on Volumes 1 and 2 (6 discs each). The picture and sound are clear, and I'm really enjoying every minute, even though I saw it originally on TV."
2,Very Dated Material,"If you are looking for a book that would be good training material. The reason I would not suggest this book is that the material is very dated and is about as current as the ultralight on the cover. The book on the other had would be good as a book to see how things use to be done in the early days of ultrlighing, not how to do them today."
4,Back in the Office,"One of the things I really liked about this newest collection of Dilbert strips is that they really stay in the office. Gone are all of the side trips to Dilbert's home, Ratbert's antics, strange dates, and other non-office stories. While many such have been quite funny, this series goes back to what Dilbert is all about; the office.Dilbert, Wally, Alice, Asok, Tina and the rest of the staff have to deal with and survive the madness that is management, marketing, payroll and the executives. They do so with their usual style. Among the story arcs in this collection are:The Secret Society of Executive SecretariesThe cursed and deadly bindersThe Non-Credible GuyThe Prima DonnaThe New HireDilbert and stopped timeBriberyThe Ultra-DonutAnd many, many more in a collection of wit, humor, and an almost scary dose of reality that has you thinking Scott Adams works in your office."
5,Can't get enough Dilbert!!!,"I don't work in an office, but Dilbert applies just as well to those of us in the education field (change pointy-haired boss to pointy-haired principal and you get the picture) I have read Dilbert from the beginning, and I love it all. Dogbert will always be my favorite, and there is plenty of him in this book, along with Dilbert, Wally, Alice, Asok, Catbert...the whole gang. Great book!"
5,Terrific book on an almost lost art,"This book opened a whole new dimension of crochet for me. --Beautiful, mind-boggling stuff. The directions are quite accurate although rather different from modern crochet books. Loved it!! This book was 1st published in 1907, and raised rather interesting questions, like :how big was an Irish match 93 years ago? You are supposed to wrap cord around 1 to 4 matches. My answer: best to add one to their count- I use 3 Chinese wooden skewers for their 2 matches!!"
5,5 stars for Silent Night as sung by Dr. John,"This album is not, in general, my style - I prefer Christmas albums that are either entirely secular or entirely religious. However, Dr. John's rendition of Silent Night makes me willing to forgive anything. The Roches versions of Adeste Fidelis and Angels We Have Heard on High are well done. Eastern Bloc's Jingle Bells and Eugene Ruffolo's Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas had little appeal. So why five stars? for Dr. John's Silent Night - you need to hear it."
2,Not that sturdy,Wasn't impressed with the sturdiness of the tool box. The plastic is rather flimsy and the the all plastic hinge is weak.
3,I guess Its good,"I take this supplement with vitamin, royal-jelly, collagen and my skin looks great! But not sure which ones is working and which ones is not doing anything.So, I guess Its good..."
5,Tones are very relaxing,This is the second JW Stannard Wind Chime we have owned. The previous one lasted 15+ years and since 1998 was outside. We had to replace the strings that hold the chimes once but the sound remained pleasing. The WC-JWS-206 is slightly lower on the scale and sounds even better. Hope the finish holds up. I would encourage you to find a site where you can listen to the sound.
5,Better than the Books,"I'm a Kerouac fan so am a bit biased, but of course, due to his ""unedited"" style he wrote lots of bad stuff and much of his work is difficult to read.I've had this collection on tape for 12 years and will buy it again one of these days on CD. His work is best this way- with Jack reading them himself and illuminating the nuances of his sometimes made-up language. If you can even stomach Kerouac's work this collection is required."
5,love this..next dvd/bluray?,"i can watch this show forever, but will the rest come out in dvd/bluray soon? at all?police language is totally correct also!"
5,SOUTHLAND - Great Show...can't wait for Season 4!!,"I loved this show when it first appeared on NBC and was super glad when TNT picked up the show after the genius' at NBC cancelled it (Oh, wait, they've done the same thing to ""Chase""...go figure!) Anyway, I purchased Season 1 on DVD back in May 2010, and I'm eagerly awaiting the release of the DVD versions of both Season 2 and Season 3, and look forward to the start of Season 4. What's going to happen to John...how well will Sammy and Ben work together...what next for Sammy and his ex...where's Lydia going with her new partner...and what about her old partner, is he done for? So many questions...let's hope the powers-that-be have the good sense to keep this great show going!"
4,An Above Average Police Drama,"This is a phenomenal show for fans of stuff like The Wire or The Shield. Though season one isn't on par with either of those shows, it showed a lot of potential for greatness and had more than its share of very memorable moments. It also boasts one of the flashiest documentary-style looks of any drama on television, which doesn't sound like a big deal but really gives the show a unique visual appeal. Season one is full of great episodes and you can read my full review of the first episode of the new second season here: [...]"
5,Review for Southland season one,"This season is excellent, everything about it keeps you watching. I knocked out the first season in one day bi enjoy the 40-45 minute episodes. It really tries to get in depth in an officer's job and lifestyle and it shows HOW much they really enjoy their job. I just finished season 2 as well. I'm going to be buying season 3 tonight for sure."
5,Great Series,My shipment arrived early and was packaged well. I love the series and I am glad that I was able to purchase this item.
3,It's okay,"Some great story lines but falls flat. The woman detective cannot act one bit and detracts from the whole show. The person who writes her lines makes her appear stupid and more stupid. If you can rent this show, fine, but don't but it."
1,This sucks.,"Only the 7 aired episodes are included, while the remaining 6 float about waiting to be broadcast.Why didn't they just wait & put all 13 episodes on this release. Utterly stupid to cancel this show before it even got off the ground.Great show. Stupid decision."
1,What? No Blu-Ray.,I don't know why these recent sets aren't put out in blu-ray. I won't buy this set ( or any other recent series ) because of that.
4,From the cover:,"Understanding parenting by thinking about who is a child, what is a parent, and why does a child need a parent, leaves dogma behind and brings the reader to the reality of daily living.Combining her experience as a mother and a grandmother with her studies in psychology and social work, the author presents a warm and human way of understanding the nature and needs of children. Parents and professionals working with children will find this a helpful book for understanding the needs of children, developing an awareness of their individual differences and observing how behaviour is learned."
5,Common-sense Waldorf parenting guide,"I found this book to be very down-to-earth, practical and calming. The author is familiar with Rudolf Steiner's teachings and the Waldorf education ideas. You can trust your instincts and travel a path of parenting between over-permissiveness and strictness. Chapters include: Parenting today, a child is born, creating his world, the apprentice, learning about the world, the golden mean, personal space, the artificial world, truth and reality, the handicapped child, independence vs. freedom, and humanness. Highly recommended."
4,Keys Wanabe,I like most of Oldmans Music. If you Like a more basic Native Flute You May want to listen before you buy this CD.
3,DVD Karaoke Question,"In order for you to change the audio channel to 2, do you need a DVD Player with a built in Dolby Digital Decoder? I can not activate the vocal guide with my DVD player, which does not have a Dolby Digital Decoder built in."
2,Not much of a real problem solver,"Fair as a gardening resource, but is basically a very large instruction manual for the line of Ortho gardening chemicals. Its whole purpose is to tell you which of their products to use for which pest or fungus or nutrient difficientcy."
5,Oustanding,"I bought this book and the pictures are outstanding. They are all life like, not sketches. It is very easy to read. This book talks about insects, climate and soil and other topics to numerous to remember."
1,"Save yourself some heart-ache, get 1200's","After 8 years of owning Technics 1210 MkII's without one problem I came to the USA and bought a pair of TTx's because of the favourable price ($300 each) and the extra pitch control,key lock, and adjustable start/stop were all great features.They were good turntables for 2 years. I liked the extra features. The overall feel wasn't bad either, not as good quality as the techics but not a horrible feeling turntable by any rate. After 2 years one of them is starting to die. When I push the start button the platter doesn't ""catch"" and I have to give it a manual push to ""lock"" it on to the motor.I'm now looking for a second hand pair of Technics like I should have from the begining and saved myself some money, time, and effort. To anyone looking at buying turntables save yourself the heart-ache, 1200's will last you for ever and you can grow old and attached to your trusty, simple, WORKING, Technics.I will really miss the extra pitch control though!"
3,Good but not great,"Unfortunately with the style of the songs, they sound too much songs that weren't good enough for Green Day's pop. But it doesn't mean it's bad. You just have to listen to it more to really get it. And unfortunately, it doesn't sound like Aaron Cometbus' band Crimpshrine (far superior to Green Day, who actually plagiarized Crimpshrine) either. It has some really cool, unconventional melodies and some great lyrics that sound just like the Cometbus zine. But please little girls, don't buy this because Billie Joe sings in PG, because his presence is nothing special. It really is Aaron Cometbus that makes the band."
5,Terror at the Zoo,"Terror At The ZooThis book is about two children, Ellen and Corey, when on their birthday they are given an overnight pass so they can stay the night at the zoo. They're excited, but when they find out that they are trapped in, and the pay phone is disconnected, they panic. It doesn't help that they hear sounds and see a........ Well you will have to read to find out what happens. This book will keep you on the edge of your seat because when you think that one thing will happen something totally different happens. I would defiantly recommend this book because I really enjoyed reading this suspenseful, high climax book. People who are mystery lovers and like a book that they can't put down will love Terror at the Zoo. I have learned from this book that you should always have a way to contact someone when you go somewhere."
3,It's a pretty good adventure book.,"Cory and Ellen go to the zoo for a sleep over. Little did they know that a burgalar was gonna be there. The burgalar has a plan to hold the monkey at the zoo (which is in Seattle) for ransom. Then they find each other and the burgalar decides to hold them for ransom. If you wish to read this book, you'll be making a wise decision!"
5,Favorite book,My fourth grade daughter said this was her favorite of Peg Keherets books. And she has read almost all of them.
4,GREAT BOOK,"I have the feeling that this book presents highly sensitive issues, particularly for people with a religious background. This book really means something to me, because it contains things that I've never heard before. To really understand it I have to have lots of spare time. Anyway, I could see that it conveys some ideas about creating world peace, which, I think, might be worth-while considering. Thanks for writing this inspiring book."
5,Beware - not new stories! Reissues!,"Just wanted to put in a quick note that this is a reissue collection. The book contains the first two books in the Coulter family series: Phantom Waltz and Sweet Nothings. So don't buy this is you're expecting something new by Catherine Anderson - it isn't! A good deal for those who have neither of those books, though - it's cheaper than buying them seperately.That being said, both of these stories are very touching, and I highly recommend the entire series, which includes: Baby Love, Phantom Waltz, Sweet Nothings, Blue Skies, Bright Eyes, My Sunshine, Summer Breeze and Sun Kissed."
5,superb,What a surprise joy this movie was - absolutely realistic and believable. You won't be disappointed.
5,wow,"I've never written a review before, but I was so impressed with this movie, I felt like I should write something. Even though I personally don't deal with the specific issues in this film, I was deeply touched by Jane Anderson's script and the performances by Jessica Lange and Tom Wilkinson are nothing short of incredible - definitely some of the best work either has ever done. I do have to agree that Jessica Lange steals the show. Her reactions to what is happening to her are exactly what I imagine someone in her shoes might go through. I liked the way church issues were dealt with as well, although it wasn't surprising that Roy was treated as an outcast by the members of the congregration. Sad, but often the case.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who needs inspiration. Very powerful film."
5,Great Movie,"I had the opportunity to view this movie as part of an assignment for a counseling class I had taken a year ago. I found it to be a very heart-warming film and wanted my own copy to view again. It is very well written and the actors did a great job in their roles. It made me cry, but it also gave me a better understanding of what a person who is experiencing such life changing decisions must deal with. There is both humor and sadness in this movie. The acceptance of the the family and town will surprise you. Great movie!"
5,Powerful and moving,This is one of the most powerful movies I have seen. The actors are great and the story touching. Love and humanism in their best form.
3,"""Oh Roy, what we do for love...""","Well, it had one of the best opening credits scenes I've ever seen- great stuff. Its a movie about this couple who have been happily married for 25 years and are still devoted and in love. And then the husband comes out and says hes a woman trapped in a man's body and wants a sex change. Its about how they deal with it.Its actually a really well done film... really good acting, well shot, well written, its a good one. Serious, and very adult- not adult like porn, just adult as in... yeah, you get it."
2,Battery Disconnect,"The item appears to be brass, but is really aluminum that is anodized a brass color. The crimp between the two isolated parts is poor so that they flop apart when the knob is loosened, requiring a few turns of the knob to be sure it does not contact. The end that is like a battery post is smaller diameter than a negative battery post, so the battery clamp has to be tightened to an excessively small size to hold properly."
2,You get what you pay for,"I was looking for a well-made battery disconnector made in the USA, and this is not it! It is very cheaply made and will not hold up after it is tightened down because if it has to be removed, the terminal arms will break apart. Not recommended."
2,bad fit,This item was a bad fit for me and I suspect others. First the battery terminal opening is none standard and to large. I had to place a shim in it to get it to clamp well. Also the battery cable mount stem is oriented the wrong way to easily mount it cable based on how it was mounted. third the cable mount end moves around when you losen the knob which will allow it to make contact still if moved and reconnect the battery. All in all not a great design.
2,Not well constructed,"It was difficult to get a tight fit on the + battery cable of my van, and as I tried to tighten the bolt, the two halves of the disconnect seperated, allowing the cable to hit the positive terminal, quite dangerous. I was able to put the two halves back together, but even though I was now being very careful, the same thing happened again. Got it on on the third try, but the cable-to-disconnect connection is still a little loose, and I'm in a seaside environment, so I'm concerned that I will not have a good connection due to corrosion. The terminal post on this disconnect needs to be fatter, and the halves need to be crimped together more securely. I've had similar disconnects in the past and not had this problem."
1,Moroso 74103 Battery Terminal Disconnect Switch,This product was advertised as fitting a Toyota Prius battery. It did not fit on the battery terminals (connections too large) and was unusable.
5,re: Pete's Cafe,"No, there's no fiction in this lovely book. Many of the illustrations are from old post card, very nicely reproduced. The Pete's Cafe illustration was from an earlier, destroyed incarnation of Pete's Cafe."
2,Mystery of Pete's Cafe,"I've only seen reviews in the New York Times and another magazine, but the picture of Pete's Cafe in this book doesn't resemble the Pete's Cafe I remember just off of I-70 on old US 40 in Booneville, MO. Is there some fiction in this book?"
5,Radha: Diary of a Woman's Search,"I read this book at the beginning of my spiritual search, and found Swami Radha's story simple and revealing. She was no angel in the beginning, which dispelled a concept I had about what it meant to be spiritual. It also revealed how patient and understanding her guru, Swami Sivananda was with her, not expecting her to be perfect. Because of Swami Radha's devotion, her weaknesses soon fell away, allowing a strong, committed Radha to emerge. The book is a quick read that can be enjoyed with ease. Her story inspired me to continue my search, with a greater level of self-acceptance."
2,So so....,"Nothing on practice very little insight,mostly a 6 months trip connecting with SIvananda.What is interesting is the fact that it took place in th 1950. A very unusual trip for a woman a precursor.Don t expect much but it is a sincere quest."
3,Nice little book but nothing special.,"This little book is only 64 pages long so don't expect too much information in it. Emma Bowd has provided quite a brief text to accompany each section and she doesn't go into any great detail. There are some nice photographs, but again, not a huge amount, certainly not enough to make you want to keep looking for long. This may be ok as a little stocking filler for a handbag mad friend but for anyone wanting serious information on handbags and/or gorgeous photo's, there are much better books available."
3,Mad about Bags,Lots of photos but does not really give any specifics about what distinguishes that particular bags. I would like to see better details so I could use the book as a guide to determine counterfeits. There are better handbag books on the market.
1,Made about FAKE bags?,"This author MUST be mad, if they thought that putting a picture of an obviously FAKE Hermes Kelly on the cover made sense."
3,English Patterns,The Sections are as follows:1. The Four Form Classes2. Three Important Structure Groups3. Sentence Patterns4. Clusters5. How Sentences Are Built6. Function Units in Sentence Patterns7. Joining Sentence Patterns8. Intonation and Punctuation9. Some Other Sentence Patterns10. Review
4,Best of Marvel's Civil War TPBs,"This trade paperback collects Amazing Spider-Man #532-538, written by J. Michael Straczynski and drawn by Ron Garney. Focusing on Peter Parker/Spider-Man's role in the Marvel Universe-encompassing Civil War, the story develops the quasi-paternal relationship between Peter and Tony Stark as the Civil War escalates. Peter's shocking public revelation in issue 533 was the first non-cinematic Spider-Man news in a long time to be covered by mainstream US media. As the conflict intensifies, Peter grows to question his siding with Stark and eventually hides with MJ and Aunt May in a decrepit motel room. The book ends with a cliffhanger that left me eager to read issue 539. Reading the main Civil War TPB is helpful but not essential as there is enough of an independent plot here for those interested only in Spider-Man."
4,Born of Two Fathers,"This is a very good feeder story for the overall Civil War event. Spider-Man has always been one of the most compelling characters in the Marvel universe and this book is no different. What I really enjoyed was the portrayal of Parker as a guy who has a good heart but is still looking for a father figure. Like the line in Platoon he is ""a child born of those two fathers, fighting for possession of my soul."" Parker is truly torn between Cap and Iron Man and, like always, his concern and need to protect his family. I would almost have like to seen a super criminal take an interest here, but I guess the Kingpin is ok. The only real problem I have with the book is that there is no reference to the major beating that Parker takes in the sewers in ""Civil War"". It's almost like it didn't happen..."
3,"good idea, bad ending","The idea of the story is really good and for the most part it was well done. I did not care for the ending though, but I am not sure what really would make for a good ending in this story."
5,Cover to cover: fantastic!,"This was a fantastic comic from cover to cover. It brings to mind the Smallville storyline where all superheroes are by law ordered to register with the government. In this comic, Iron Man is on the side of the government and he uses deception to get Spider-Man onto his side. When Spider-Man discovers he has been taken for a ride, that's when things get incredibly interesting and exciting. This comic really jumps off the page. Feels like you're watching a film...a superhero film you wish would be brought to screen in these days of overly dull superhero films!"
2,"SOME VERY USEFUL INFO, BUT NOT ENOUGH SUBSTAN","As other reviewers have noted, this book is simply not worth the money. Admitedly it has a few bits of useful information not easily available elsewhere, but for the most part it is simply a repetition (with a few interesting illustrations to make the point) of what is in the manual that comes with a camera. Even worse, much of the book is devoted to explaining fundamental photographic principles, available almost anywhere else. This is supposed to be a book exclusively about the Digital Rebel, not a primer on photo fundamentals. In addition, the poor print and binding quality is unforgivable in an era where even $5.95 books are professionally printed & professionally bound. Perhaps if the key information not found elsewhere about the digital rebel were distilled form here and compiled with other vital digital rebel info in another (shorter) book, it would be worth getting. But certainly not for the asking price of this book."
3,Free Learning center for Digital Rebel,"Here is a link from the Canon web site to the Canon digital learning center for the Digital Rebel (300E). It contains basic info about this camera. I found it helpful. Best of all, its free!http://www.photoworkshop.com/canon/lessons/"
3,rebal eos,"A good basic text on features of the camera. Easier to read and use than the manual. Good tid-bits here and there. Better for the beginner, but also useful in relaying the particulars of the camera. I'm a long time SLR user just converting to digital. Most was review but did teach some of the necessary adjustments. It is really a wonderful camera for the price, I found this book to be useful in this transition.I agree with previous post regarding cost vs quality. For this price, I would have expected more, not basic photo copy type paper.If you are experienced in SLR's or digital, than there are better books available. If just starting digital photography, than I found this book helpful."
2,Not what I had hoped for.,"I bought this book after getting my rebel xt and couldn't wait for it to arrive. The user manual that came with the camera didn't help at all and I was looking forward to getting a book that could help get me started in the right direction.Well, it took over 6 weeks for the book to arrive and when it did I found it to be nothing but a glorifed user manual. Very disappointing.I have had better luck from Popular Photography magazine and learning from books written by professionals like John Shaw and Art Wolfe.This book wasn't worth the price and wait for it to arrive."
2,Overpriced,"Sorry but as mentioned before, this is just a tiny bit better then the manual that came with the rebel. I wish I would have read the reviews first as they are not very good. It has some content that is usefull but all in all, a real rip off."
1,Punk World Magazine editor Spikey Joe,"""Monotnous drogeny should be the name of this Avail effort"". Unlike such bands as Dillinger 4, Jesus Scuad, Early Warning, this band sucks. It goes for the obvious bass line and unriveting guitar hooks. The secret track ( an accoustic ballad which expresses Beau-Beau's homosexual tendencies towards the bass player Brian.)sets the tone for the entire album. I meen come on homosexuality went out in the 80's along with slinkys."
2,a child's garden of verses,"the book is not what i expected, i had a old book by the same name but it had ,many, many more verses."
1,misrepresented book size,"No book size specified on website. Assumed unspec'd CLASSIC illustrated children's book to be at least 8.5 X 11"". Disappointed to receive 5 X 7"" book. Will not do business here again."
3,"The toddler isn't into it, but i think its lovely.","Its a bit long and old fashioned for the usual board book crowd, but i love the sweet pictures. And when we just use it as a picture book the cow illustration is a huge hit."
2,Scratches easily,"When this table arrived, the magazine rack was damaged, scratched and warped. The magazine rack also had a sticker attached to it that was very difficult to remove and leaves visible residue on the table. Many holes were cut the wrong size, making assembly difficult. The table looks great, but I am afraid it won't last long without acquiring many scratches."
1,Damaged Goods,"Sirs,I am very dissatisfied with the product. I received my replacement (after a damaged first shipment) and the second is damaged too. I responded to Amazon as to what I should do a few days ago and have heard nothing back. I would like a refund.Maybe you could help me. I have ordered things in the past and have never had problems before.The table top was damaged in the same place in both shipments and I suggested you investigate the packaging of the item.Thank you.Teresa Young"
2,Be careful,"I purchased the Florenza coffee table,and I'll share my thoughts.The design is pleasant enough,but the table is cheaply made.My table arrived with flaws to the top of the table,and the finish is not all that great.It's very easy to put together,but my lower shelf came crashing down one night!I guess that you get what you pay for.If you need a quick,inexpensive table,it's O.K. As a Designer,I will not ""spec"" it again. Also,if you are expecting a nice shiny lacquer,forget it........It's flat black."
4,Title is misleading: Bad Guy is a drama from 2010,"I haven't seen this 2008 drama, but it sounds good; so for the sake of saying my piece I gave it 4 stars. Kwon Oh Joon (Jang Hyuk who starred in the drama Thank You) is a swindler who falls for a widow with a 5 year old daughter, Jin Dal Rae. Dal Rae lives with her daughter and mother-in-law after her husband passes away. Oh Joon is a suave man who can talk women into doing anything.The Korean database calls it Robber. Other titles include Thief, Con Man, Bandit, Scoundrel. Bad Guy or Bad Boy (I've seen both titles used) is a Korean Drama from 2010 that is entirely different; and I look forward to Amazon picking it up when it becomes available on DVD. I've seen a little less than half of it and so far it's 5 stars."
5,Texas Bride is First Rate!,"This very enjoyable, quick and easy read is everything one loves in a historical Western tale!Don't pass it up!"
3,Fun Sequel With Way Cool Death Scenes,"Highly recommended DVD for horror and gore fans. Sure, it's essentially a remake of the first one but aren't most horror sequels? This one has some way cool death scenes, especially one involving a character cut into three pieces right before your eyes! The Infini film dvd aspects are a lot of fun too and show how all the death scenes were done."
3,"Final Destination 2 Is Good, Creepy Fun","The idea of cheating death was done quite well in the first film, which offered moviegoers a chilling, authentic recreation of an actual plane crash. In the sequel, we get an equally exciting highway crash that is superbly created and edited by the filmmakers. This film is also pretty adept at some horrifying deaths that cry ""Hit the rewind button."" All in all the film is definately worth a peek. It's also a lot better than some of the garbage that has been hitting movie screens this summer."
2,MORE ROTTEN HORROR FARE! (Spoiler Below),"""Final Destination 2,"" like it's predecessor, is a scary film: scarily bad. With the people knowing what signs to look for before a death occurs, there's no sense of terror: We pretty much KNOW how people are going to die. The few jump moments are put in as almost an afterthought. And the death scene at the end felt like a Monty Python gag than an actual horror film element. The cast does a descent job with what they got, but it's not enough to save this horrible horror film. For straight horror-film fans only; the rest can skip it.Movie/DVD Grade: D"
2,OVERATED,This movie is way overated. The acting is childish and it wasn't even scary at all. The first Final Destinaton was at least tempting to scare you with it's death sequences. You shoudl just stick to the first movie it was a little frightening.
3,Almost there,"The first film had a much better storyline, and MUCH better acting, but that's it. This film took the kills to a level the first film should have. The death scenes made this movie, even though some were completely ridiculous (elevator hook scene) some rocked (tree in car and pieces of exploding news van). I recommend renting this film for a good time, but not worth the price to buy."
4,Not the average edge-of-your-seat-thriller,"Closer and closer still the puzzle pieces come together. If you like cringing at the excruciating pain on the big screen, or contemplating how the plot is developing, this one's for you. Woven around a twisted plot and wrapped together; but not with that cheesy gift wrap. It's got amazement turn after turn, you'd wished you left your mouth closed for most of the movie. Not the typical sugar coated junk, but everything else but that. Snuggle close with that special someone or share a couch with the good ole boys or girls, cause this one's gonna jolt your seat!!"
2,"dumb characters, unlikely scenarios",Characters in this movies all are dumb4ss who have no common sense. So disasters happen to them. That basically sum up it.
4,Gruesome Death Scenes = Good Time at the Movies,"Final Destination 2 is a good time! The plot may be a little thin at times, but the action scenes make up for all of that. This has some of the coolest death scenes you'll ever witness in a horror flick. Plenty of gore if you like that kind of thing. The car accident scene at the beginning is priceless. So if you'd like to see someone take a ladder in the eyes, get flattened by a sheet of glass, get sliced in three by a barbed wire fence, get decapitated by an elevator door, etc etc, then watch this flick for sure!"
4,Pretty decent!,"Final Destination 2 is a pretty good effort for a sequel to a very good movie. The idea was a lot better than I had expected, and stays pretty true to the first movie. Although the first will always be the best, I would still recommend this one to get the originality of both movies."
3,A nice experience if you don't expect too much different from the first.,"The first was somewhat original and some of the characters were better. It was fresh then, and then comes along part two.The initial crashes on the highway is intense and there is gore, gore, gore galore throughout.The coincidental deaths at time are too unbelievable to fathom, and may leave you wanting more realism.But if you haven't seen it in a while (6 months or so) then I'd give it a spin again. The first felt fresh after years of me not viewing it.3.8 stars."
3,Good non horror sequel,Final Destination 2 proved something that most horror film sequels can't. If a scary movie sequel is full of laughs it can be fun. The film is full of good acting in particular A.J. Cook who carrys her first starring role very well. Tony Todd makes another chilling cameo and Ali Larter also does another good job. I hope this isn't the last Destination for the series. I give it *** stars based soley on the death sequences. The film is lot of fun and I can't wait to see Final Destination 4 in 3-D next year.
3,GET THE FULL SCREEN DVD INSTEAD OF THE VIDEO,"If you watch this on a VHS tape then you'll miss all the really gross and funny parts. Its best to watch certain parts in slow motion.As for the movie itself....its just a bunch of people getting killed. Its entertaining to watch once or twice, but the first movie is much more interesting."
5,Death is coming for us...,"i liked Final Destination but i LOVED Final Destination 2.it is much more violent and gory.being impaled...crushed to death...they just die in many many violent ways.watch it or ""TODAY MAY BE YOUR DAY TO DIE""!just kidding..anyway,just watch it"
1,"SO BAD, Please let it be the FINAL Destination...","The first Final Destination was fresh and inventive. The death scenes and scenarios were captivating. That has all gone stale in it's sequel. Yes, many people continue to die in Final Destination 2 but this time you're actually rooting for them to die. The acting in this film is so atrocious it's not even funny. I don't even know who the hell these people were, but man they cannot act, especially the female lead. This time a group of people cheat death after escaping a deadly traffic accident. Some of the deaths are pretty gory which is cool but the acting is so bad it ruins the film. The ending is utterly ridiculous and all but assures yet another sequel. The only thing I can guarantee about the sequel is that I won't be there! Avoid!"
2,Hopeless Bluray,I got this BD yesterday & was expecting a better version than the DVD but unfortunately its the worst bluray Ive gotFirstly there is no startup menu no subtitles pop up menu has just one option of sound no scene selection ( if you have to watch a particular chapter you have to start from begining & manually go to the particular chapter which is frustating after paying almost 35$.) The picture & sound quality are pretty good but the DVD version has much more options than this Bluray. DO NOT BUY THIS BD & GET FOOLED.
4,Final Destination 2 is better than the first,"This movie is more interesting and better than the first movie, because have better special effects, the movie has a very good actors, maybe can win some awards (I don`t think so, but if Chiacgo wons 8 Oscar, why Final Destination 2 can`t win one?"
3,Its okay,"What made the first one great were the cool characters that were getting picked off one by one.The characters in this one are not worth thinking twice about.The original had awsome setups to the kills,you didnt know how they were going to die.This has two really wicked kills the rest are weak,just wait until the last kill. I laughed all night after that one.The movie is a weaker version of a great horror film,but not bad."
4,Great 6.1 DTS ES sound,"I purchased this DVD used based on the 6.1 DTS ES sound. The movie is what it is - a Horror movie with death around the corner. The 6.1 sound is excellent. The rear surround speakers are effectively utilized and not just a repetition of the 5.1 surround speakers. The subwoofer rocks the house. So, if you are a fan of this genre film and are looking for a great 6.1 DTS ES sound, pick this movie up. Enjoy, j."
5,Fans of the first will like...,"Ok ok ok now some people on other websites have given this movie a 2 or 3, but I will give it two thumbs up and 5 stars. I saw this movie before this one and then just last month I saw the 1st ""Final Destination"". I really enjoyed both films and I always will. This kovie is also the first movie to make me jump out of my seat and almost piss my pants. This movie was kinda' dull at some parts such as the start when A.J. Cook is just sitting down eating and watching the news about flight 180 from the 1st movie for about 10 minutes. And my favorite death would be after the kid runs out to the birds and the glass falls on hima and folds him into 3 pieces."
3,Better than part 1,Great car crash sequence and I loved it when that annoying kid blew up by the BBQ at the end of the movie!! Awesome.If it wasn't for the fact that death itself is a stupid slasher movie villain this movie would be ok. I prefer masked madmen with knives and axes. Call me old fashioned.I thought this one was far better directed than the first one.
3,Final Destination 2,"When I first heard of this film I thought that it would be really bad, (and in all honesty it really is). But I still saw the movie thinking maybe it will have some cool killing sequences and maybe, maybe a story. When the film started up and the gigantic car crash began I was hooked into it. And as the film unraveled I could care less if there was a plot, I could care less that the acting was horrible, all I wanted to see was ways that the characters were killed. Overally this is a bad movie, its really only watching a bunch of people dying. If you want to see a fun movie that will scare you and make you laugh (At the bad acting, plot, and writting) then see this film."
2,Not even half as good as the fist one,"Where Final Destination 1 was amazingly surprising and original I feel this second part was way over the top and nowhere near as original as the first one. Sure, some turns of events in this second part were very well thought of but part 1 is far more thrilling than this one. The whole feel of part 1 is more intense than this 'let's do the dame trick again'part 2. But... whatmakes buying the DVD REALLY worth your money is NOT the movie itself but the many, many, many special features! Seeing how all the ""death scenes"" were actually made are woth alone having this DVD for."
4,(;D),I personally don't think it was that bad still found it entertaining i've seen worst sequels than this....it was still sticking to the so call grand design of death i just found it entertaining seeing them trying to prevent it....
3,"Very Good Sequel, But too much deaths and not enough story!","This is a very good sequel! It has one of the best opening scenes in any horror movies, since the opening scene in Ghost Ship! This movie is a very gruesome sick movie! If you have a faint heart please do not watch this movie! It is not for you! You will not be able to take all the blood and gore! The one thing i did not like about this movie is that there is too much deaths and not enough story! Its like every 10 minutes in the movie there is a death and a death! I mean they could of made it longer or could of took out 1 or 2 deaths! But still i liked it!"
5,Best movie ever!!,This is an ingenous movie that shows a group of teenagers as they try to escape death. Death has a new plan for them an the entire movie is based on their efforts to escape death. It has a very interesting plot and it's not that scary.
4,Lots of bodies for your buck,"This movie gets kicking with a brilliant multi-vehicle pile-up scene where you get a first person perspective of several of the victim's predicaments. It doesn't slow down much after this, with one freak fatality following closely after another. The plot ties back to the original movie and the ripple effect created by the key characters avoiding death at that time. Overall, if you are looking for a decent 90 minutes of compelling entertainment you won't be too disappointed."
2,So so,"Final Destination 1 is MUCH better. The sequel lost the elements of suspense and horror. Fin. Destination 2 is one big gore-fest. The people are killed off one by one in random order with no warning. (The first one had the suspense building shadow and wind)The ""visions"" that one character experiences spelling doom are neither believable nor scary. This movie is ok but doesn't live up to the first."
4,One of the best sequels I have seen in awhile!,"This movie was one of the best sequels I have seen in a while. Final Destionation doesn't have the best acting, but it has the best gore! This movie was thrilling and disgustingly [yucky]! The plot wasn't exactly better, and I didn't like the fact the (Devon Sawa, main character in Final Destination) dies in between the two movies. I can't wait for hopefully the third installment which there should be, and there is many rumors that there will be! This is one of the best horror flicks since 28 days Later, and The Ring. 3 1/2 stars!!"
5,A NEW HORROR CLASSIC,"there arent many horror movies to come out since the 80s that can come close to classic but this one does. Alot smarter than some of the 80s movies (with exception of Elm Streets firsts) with a good story line. The gore is top notch, the acting is good enough and its SEE IT AGAIN value very high. Sit back, clear yor mind and have fun with this new classic! Dont forget the tons of INFINIFILM extras also"
1,SUCK OUT!,This sequel sucks big time so do not see it. What were the makers thinking? It only deserves one star for the excellent death scenes. Everything else was horrid. 100% crap. Here is hoping that the next sequel Final Destination III does not dissapoint.
2,Sequal? no,"With the success of Final Destination 1, this would have been a great sequal of sort, if they had put more time in writing the story line. The actors are good, but the storyline in FD2 can not be compare to FD1. The idea was good, but not as exciting or suspense as the first.A disappointment. Gave it an extra star b/c the idea was good."
2,What happened to Alex!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I watched fd1 a few daya ago and Carter had died and the end credits came on. I watched fd2 and Alex was nowhere to be found. Then on the Computer it was a list of all the flight 180 deaths,and there was Alex.It said that while he was in an alley and a brick fell from a building and hit him in the head killing him.how could someone survive being electrocuted but coulden't survive a brick!!I thought Clear was on the list before Alex. then later Clear said something about alex's death being her fault. so i figured he pushed her out of the way of a car and a car hit the wall. Then the wind blew a brick and the brick fell on Alex.I give this movie a 2 because of the explanation of alex's death."
1,"Terrible, Just Like The first One",This is a movie that basicly says Hollywood is not as good as it used to be. And also this movie is geared towards and audience of 20 somethings that has been warped by watching nothing but MTV and would be stupid enough to believe what they saw in the movie and would accually believe that the reaper is after them. Plus They SEVERELY over exaggerated the blood-shed.The only cool parts of it were the accident in the begining.( But when I watched that part again it sucked.)And the other cool part with the same results when i watched that part the second time was the when the window fell on the kid and crushed him. 2 parts cool once and sucked the second time.
3,Final Destination 2,"Kimberly's terrifying premonition prevents her and a handful of other motorists from dying in a horrible accident on the highway, but the worst has yet to come when Death returns to settle the score! FINAL DESTINATION 2 ups the ante when it comes to shockingly outlandish deaths and the completely contrived scenarios in which they occur. While the basic plotline follows closely in line with the original, it becomes all the more convoluted and jokingly unrealistic when Kimberly begins using precognition to unravel Death's plan rather than simply relying on her instincts as Alex had done in the past. Still, that does not take away from the sheer enjoyment and surprise that each new death provides along the way. This first sequel packs some of the greatest moments in the series thanks to the continued use of clever misdirection leading in to each kill and the amplified gore over the original.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
5,Fantastic!,"I truly loved this movie when I watched it for the first time, like 3 months ago. After that I bought part 1 and part 2, but I think this one is even better. The special effects are so weird and they're very cool, because you don't see a guy get killed by a giant glass in every movie, or do you?. This is very good and the story is very interesting and you never know if they'll be able to save the next victim."
4,Book Back in Print,The previous poster noted that the book has fallen out of print. I'm happy to say that I contact Holy Cross Seminary Bookstore last week and I now have a copy of this book on my shelf. FYI.
2,only for mixtape lovers........,"..this is an unfortunate project.....I LOVE THE THE ROOTS.....i have been following the 5th dynasty since i first heard 'do you want more' in 1995....back then snoop dogg had just come out and was taking the world by storm.....then my friend s brother gave me the 'do you want more' tape (yes it was that long ago) and I was sold, i did away with 'doggy style' and was enlightened with 'proceed', 'what goes on', 'silent treatment', 'the lesson' etc....the roots are a legendary, innovative rap/hiphop band and mix tapes ruin this!! If you want a the best of the roots, buy both the 'home grown beginners' guides to the roots...then buy all their other albums....absolute genius rap/hiphop. I do not recommend this mix tape/perversion! Don't waste your money...if you are curious, download it for free!"
2,Not for the ordinary Joe,"Not worth the buy: Borrow it or get it at a flea market. First off, it looks like some biology book, nothing artistic about it. The book is filled with old drawings that are probably royalties free anyway. Maybe it's OK as a reference book.Get Jack Hamm's book instead: More tips and tricks on drawing animals."
2,thumbs down,"Only five animals spotlighted. No explanation of orientation i.e. dorsal. No explanation of what is depicted, especially maddening with certain cross sections. The art is uniform, clean, and attractive. The attention to each animal is not identical, i.e. ones mouth is highlighted in depth while others are not."
3,"Good, but there are better options","I got this one hoping it had something more to add to my other anatomy book by Goldfinger. However I found it to be the pricier, but less in-depth option. It covers mostly the horses with other domestic animals and a random lioness thrown in. The lack of other animals is disappointing. I would love to see a bird or a shark in one of these, but so far I'm coming up dry. While the in-depth descriptions of the muscle structures are very well done, there are better, cheaper options out there."
2,Very Limited.,"I thought that for the most part this book was very disappointing. It contains a limited number of animals, about 14, most of which I could just walk outside and see live any day I wanted. The book contains tons of detail for a few of the common animals and for lions, but the other half of the animals in this slim book are limited to one or two small half page pictures that aren't even all that helpful. Save your money and find something better."
2,An OK Anatomy book for the price,"While this book does have lots of good references for anatomy most of the images can be found by doing a simple internet search (goggle horse anatomy & you'll see what I mean) It is nice to have the images all in one place, but it only really covers domestic animals, horses, cows, dogs, cats. Small section with lion anatomy and few images in the back of odd animals like a bat and seal, sadly no birds. The book was first published in the 50's and while it says ""for Artist"" it's more like a vet hand book. If you have the extra money & are an artist looking for animal anatomy books, I recommend ""Animal Anatomy for Artists: The Elements of Form"" over this book. While is does tell you the name of every muscle so does ""Animal Anatomy for Artists: The Elements of Form"""
4,Must for anatomical artistry,"I have seen this book as a required text in several creature design and anatomy art classes. After getting much use out of an E-book version, I decided to get the hard copy as well. Its THAT useful! While I've noticed some reviews complain that it only features 5 animals, I might note that these are some of the most commonly used species in art, and the common house cat isn't going to vary that dramatically from the anatomy of a lion, past proportions. I LOVE the amount of detail given to each and every species, with pages of full orthographics from every angle, with specific focus given to the heads and limbs. There are also proportion scales provided.A HIGHLY recommended resource to anyone with an interest in zoology, anatomy, or creature design."
1,The book hasn't come yet,"Hei, can you check where my book is now? It was said that the book is coming to me 5.2.2013 but now is 21.february and I havent't got the book."
4,Works well,"Item description accurate, met expectations, and arrived on time. I have used this brand in the past, has always work well."
5,perfect fit.,I purchased this holster for conceal carry with my Walter p22 and it fits perfectly. and gives me the option between front carry or to carry on my back
2,Not Right Hand,"I bought this off the ""deals"" pricing. This holster fits the gun OK but it is a left hand, not right hand holster. Looks like someone put in back in stock and did not understand it was left hand. I kept the holster because it fits my gun."
3,Check size before ordering,"The product is great for the price. However, I had to return it because I had to guess the size but it was too small. I figured a #1 would be fine for my Kel-Tec PF9 but I was wrong. I'm not sure if the gun to size is on the Uncle Mike website. I'd sure check it before I ordered."
3,the belt clip could be better made,"The material this holster uses seems to be strong enough and the holster seems well designed for it's intended use. My issue is with the belt clip being made of plastic rather than metal, it may hold up, but only time will tell, I think this will serve my purpose for some period of time."
2,watch description,Read carefully the size chart because is confusing and it takes a while for the customer service...
4,Nice Holster,"This is a nice holster. My only slight complaint is that the clip is made of plastic and I wonder how long it will maintain good tension. Also, unlike the product picture, there is a velcro retention strap. I ended up cutting it off because the way I use the holster I would not need it. It perfectly fits my Springfield sub compact .40 and fits well in the small of my back."
1,Don't buy this.,This cd was put out by Hammerheart (now Karmageddon Media) and is a bootleg which means it should never be supported. A big label like Hammerheart shouldn't do this. Metal fans need to wake up and stop buying bootlegs. It's the worst kind of rip off thievry stealing someone's music and making money on it. Boycott Karmageddon Media thieves!!!
5,Excellent! Interesting! A great gift!,"I ordered this book to give away as a door prize. When it arrived, I glanced through it, but was so captivated that I sat down and read through the entire book immediately (even though I had/have no plans to ever cook any of the food) -- it was a fascinating glimpse into the life and times of Frida, Diego and others. Then I ordered three more to give as gifts to friends."
4,Frida's Fiestas,Fast delivery. Would have liked to know that there is a message to someone written insight otherwise it is in new conditions.
2,Frida's Fiestas,More a gift for someone who loves to have recipe books than that it gives a better view on the life of Frida Kahlo.
4,"Exquisite, fabulous...a true aphrodisiac!",Adding a culinary aspect of Frida's life was an incredible idea! Lupe Marin does an excellent job in sharing the secrets of popular Mexican food and how they influenced the art and persona of Frida Kahlo. This book definitely opens the senses to sensual recipies you could share with friends and significant others!
5,"Frida,s Fiestas Recipes and Reminiscences of life with Frida Kahlo",the recipes are fantastic. the ceremonies for special events when these foods were prepared are part of the traditions that were followed. the book is easy to read and follow.
3,"Sad, Realstic and Convincing""","There are a lots of assorted characters in this very long subtitled film and sometimes it's difficult to identify their reltionships or to differentiate between them. Add to that confusion, some type of muddled criminal activity and undercover police work involving ,""The Belgian hormone mafia."" What is portrayed rather vividly, however, is a childhood trauma and its impact on the adult life of the victim. Difficult to watch these segements which are sad, realistic and convincing."
2,pump issues,"Even in bright light, the pump is audible, but the water flow is unreliable. Not just a matter of clouds. I have seen 3v, ""bait well"" pumps work better. When it works it looks nice."
4,Spiritual use,Excellent book for any Healer who is looking to have some reference books and look at other forms of energy work to incorporate into the practice.
4,"nice balm, but too heavily scented","its a nice balm but was too heavily scented for my tastes... which is a shame cause I think its a great scent... if only they could tone it down a little, this would be GREAT."
5,The juice.,This is awesome! I've used Director for 2 years and was really excited about the new 3D features in 8.5 but thought I'd have to spend months learning how to use the engine. In 1 week of reading this I made my first user activated 3D projector that plays sound relational to my world.I know why this book is so good: I looked at these guys sites in the front of the book for these authors - these guys really know how to create. Examples are inspirations!This is the juice. I want more. Give me more.PG Juice.
2,Wrong for Toyota,I ordered this for a 2002 Toyota Sienna. This product does not fit the 2001 to 2003 Toyota Sienna.
2,Not enough Disney,"I hate to sound like an ingrate writing this review: Herb Ryman has done some great illustrations. Unfortunately, this book spends too much time showcasing Herb Ryman's non-Disney art--which is pretty mediocre--and not enough space showcasing his Disney work. The highlight of the book--Ryman's first illustration of the soon-to-be-built Disneyland--is spread across two pages, but the page break makes it nearly impossible to decipher what's in the middle of the drawing. (It should have perhaps been on a fold-out, or at least on a single, uninterrupted page.) Other great illustrations, especially early renderings of Tomorrowland, are printed in extremely small 3"" images, making them very hard to read. All in all, I'd say don't bother with this book. Ryman's best drawings are already showcased in many other books."
3,Not much concept art of early golden Disney animation period,"It is a great book when you want to learn about collors and style in Disney park design, but not much on the period of Dumbo animation and other early disney design and concept art for animation in the golden period of disney animation. Still great paintings and Aquarels (study the techniques) from traveling and the design paintings, for the disney world themeparks. It gave me the Idear of buying a sketchbook for my world traveling.Jan Reijmerink Drontywood ART"
3,"Good, but misleading","I found A Brush With Disney to be an overall good book. It looks great on the coffee table and shelf, has a beautiful cover, and clear, quality illustrations. That being said, if you think this is a book full of Disney concept art (as I did) you'll be disappointed. The book is not about Disney, but about the artist and his life and work. His work at Disney takes up only about a fourth of the book. I also thought it would feature concept work for different rides, parks, etc. In actuality it only had concept work for the parks and a few of the ""lands"" in Disneyland (Frontierland, New Orleans Square, Sleeping Beauty's Castle, etc.) I felt a bit cheated after paying $65 because it's as if the artist is selling himself under the Disney name for publicity and name recognition. Anyone heard of Herbert Dickens Ryman before? I sure haven't. I didn't give it a one star rating simply because the content is good, it's just not about what is advertised and promoted on cover."
1,Useless with a Macbook,"These DVD-Rs became 5 coasters after my Macbook tried to work with them. No matter what speed I burned at, these discs failed. Other discs have worked great, so there is something about these that is problematic."
5,Brilliant analysis of Shakespeare and popular culture,"Unspeakable Shaxxxspeares is a brilliant analysis of how Shakespeare has thoroughly infiltrated all corners of our culture. Our notion of ""Shakespeare as classic"" will never be the same. It gives a whole new meaning to cultural studies, and will infuriate everyone who has a stake in patrolling the boundaries between popul and high culture, whether in the hopes of subverting or maintaining them. Burt is particularly good at diagnosing the forms of ""academic fantasy"" by which professors hope to instruct, politicize, and identify with the populace and the younger generation. And this book is fun to read! The discussions of film, TV episodes, porn movies, and music are great. Now I need to go to the video store, and see more of the stuff he writes about."
3,How Shakespeare and Popular Culture Can Intersect,"No one in the world knows more about Shakespeare on the fringes than Richard Burt. He has collected myriad specimens for his curiosity cabinet and stands ready to share them in an interesting and meaningful way. As a keen student of Shakespeare and popular culture, he stands in the vanguard of a growing movement to erase older demarcations between high and low art."
4,Great product,"I received this product very quickly....no problems.I would recommend this product to all who wish to have streak free windows, glass top ranges, etc."
5,Excellent Product,This product was recommended by my cleaning lady and she was spot on. It's a great cleaning product and I highly recommend.
5,The Bible!,If you are interested on valuating get it. If you are a experience on valuation it's a good reference book.
1,Too academic,"The book is too academic. Many of its formulas are not used on Wall Street. At 900 pages, much was repeated."
5,Motorola,"I Own a GSM Razr V3 Black Edition, and I Think this is a Nice Phone, There's is other phones with more usefull stuff, but i believe this kind is an excelent one and great style phone..."
1,Maroon RAZR V3i Maroon Phone,I was very unhappy with the phone. It did not tell me anywhere in the info that the phone may not work with the internet. It is a phone that was sold in Europe and is not compatable with the web services in the United States. So I spent quite abit of money on something that is of no use to me.
3,Be Cautious In Accepting This As a Historical Account,"Before accepting too much of this author's version of history, PLEASE read Dave Crocker's review in ""The Internet Protocol Journal"" (December, 2002, pages 27-30). Dave lived through this era as a major participant and his review is well worth the read."
1,That Shoes Sucks!!!,I Just Get It And I Wear It Not Over 10 Minutes And The Left Part Of The Right Shoe Started To Ripped Of... I Wish I Could Have A NEW One Or My Money Back It Was A Worthless Buying...I Sent Them Back For A Replacement Just Like They Say Me To An Email And I Dont Have Answer Yet I W8 Over 2 Months... I Thnik I Will Go To A Lawyer Or Something Like That..I Will Sent Email To Amazon And Then I Will See About Electick Kid
4,I wore these for my wedding!,"For my wedding, when the bride changed into a golden Jovani dress, I changed into cream pants, Golden shirt and vest and these shoes. definate show stoppers!!!"
4,super!!!! beautiful!,I like this shoes very much ! You can wear it with every thing and it can be smart or sporty.....I am very happy to bought it
5,Love this book!,"We love this! I've been using it for 3 years now- I started with a four y-o. He likes the activities even more as he gets older!The activities are arranged by type: Performance, Words, Art, Music, Holidays, Dance, Birthday, Vacation, Animal, Food, and The Big onesFrom family dance, to pet cans, to dinner conversation...there are so many 'paloozas' here, and enough detail to follow his instructions like an activity recipe OR, if you're just looking for ideas, they are also great launch-pads!"
2,Now what I expected,"The activities offered in this book were old school and kind of lame. I was going to give it to my niece for her kids, but I could just see them rolling their eyes when my niece tried to engage them in the suggested activities. So it went to Good Will"
5,Great book for environmental chemistry,"I have used this book while taking a course in environmental chemistry. This book is easy to read, understand and really simplified a very complex and interesting topic. It covers wide range of topics in envrionmental chemistry. I really recommend my fellow students to get this book !"
2,not authentic,the text I received is much thicker (nearly 2x the size) than the original 1300 page text which makes for a very heavy load. The images are much darker than those it was compared to as well. I can only assume that this text is not authentic.
1,Vampire Accumulations,"I'm not surprised to find that in three years this book has been ignored. Would that I had done so!This is nothing more than an inventory. Ms. Altner does nothing to educate, enlighten or entertain. True, she has accumulated a great many books, but this is really just a reading list, her reading list!I'd advise you to take a walk down to your local bookstore to get the same information. At least then you could say you got some exercise and fresh air. Or, if it's raining, stay on this site and browse for yourself."
4,I got mine autographed!,"This CD features some great horror themed songs. Classics like ""Monster Mash"", ""Haunted House"" and ""The Purple People Eater"". Plus great lesser known songs like ""The Creature From The Black Lagoon"", ""Halloween Spooks"" and ""Voodoo Voodoo"". The only bad song here is ""Full Moon"", sung by Elvira herself. In fact, if it hadn't been performed by Elvira, it wouldn't have been considered good enough to be on this CD. The other problem I have with this CD is that it only has 17 tracks, while the LP and cassette versions had 23 tracks. The CD is only 54 minutes long, so it's not like there wasn't room for the 6 extra tracks. For the record, the missing songs are: ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"", ""Little Demon"", ""Attack of the Fifty Foot Woman"", ""King Kong"", ""The Creature"" and ""Martian Hop"". But this is still probably the best horror themed music compilation available."
2,"Not good for every application, and not for ""batteries""","These terminals are for 6awg wires (or smaller), not for anything near what most automotive battery cables actually use, which is 4, 2, even 1/0 cables, which makes the title description of the add misleading, because they will NOT work for MOST battery cables. They are also only rated for 50amps. again that would make them unusable for jump start remote terminals or battery (main) disconnects, which is what I wanted them for. I rated them a 2 because of the title, Im sure these would be great for other uses, but not battery disconnects.They would be useful for MUCH smaller battery systems, like lawnmowers, go carts, things of that nature... but... how many of us modify the starting/charging systems on those contraptions?I digress, I will be sending these back to Amazon for something else."
2,weather channel weather station,My outdoor transmitter stopped working in less than a year. The inside part still works but you dont know what the temperature is outside and thats the main reason why we bought it. I'm going to buy a different brand this time.
3,Okay for the price but you get what you pay for,"This product is the second weather station I've owned by LaCrosse and they've both only lasted about a year before they quit working. This one will still record the inside temperature but it will no longer record the outside temperature or keep time. But it never kept accurate time anyway, it was always slow. However, you do get what you pay for and this is a cheapy. It's okay but only look for it to last a year or so."
1,These are not 100% cotton,"I ordered these from another site--the Indera Mills thermals are 65% cotton, 35% polyester. I was disappointed with the thinness and feel--doesn't anyone make pure cotton clothes anymore??"
1,This book is a dog.,"Although this book claims to be an ""ALL NEW 3rd EDITION,"" I found it completely outdated. Most all the hotels I have contacted from San Luis Obispo to La Jolla, do not take pets, and haven't for years. For instance, in the La Jolla section, all 6 hotels listed as taking pets, do not. If you're really looking for hotels that take pets, with this book, you're barking up the wrong tree."
1,NO-NO-NO-NO,"I bought this to convert some .AVI and .MOV files so I could try video podcasting with a web multimedia class I teach. I've done this successfully with a shareware product, but thought the resulting video could be a little sharper, so I was willing to pay for and try a commerical product. (Pinnacle, right? They do a lot of this stuff, they must know what they're doing . . . . ) HA!!!! HUGE mistake. The interface is horrible, and the conversion just-plain-sucks. Everything came out in flouescent colors with huge blocks covering the screen. Totally, completely unwatchable. It looks like a 60s psychedellic experience, like ""motion art,"" not like a proper video at all. Avoid this product!!!"
3,"good account of IRS abuses, but not very instructive","Michael Minns, like most attorneys, doesn't know squat about tax law, only court procedures. He, like all attorneys has never challenged liability for income tax, but has won all his cases by proving his clients were not ""willful,"" which is the necessary element of any alleged ""crime."" Throughout this book, he acknowledges that most attorneys, IRS people, even judges don't understand the tax code. Yet, like most bureaucrats, he insists that everyone owes the tax, but can not explain what law makes them liable. I recommend this book only to inform people of what to expect from the court system, and from IRS attorneys. However, for those who want to get out of the tax system, I would recommend ""Cracking the Code: The fascinating truth about Taxation in America"" by Pete Hendrickson. That book will explain how the tax system started, and how you can escape, legally."
2,total s*** but they get the job done,"i got these when i was in a pinch and just wanted to make music with a midi program on my computer, and they get the job done. but they are stiff even with constant plying. i now own the micro korg xl, a huge step up. but totally worth every penny. also the keys on this thing are ridiculously small..."
2,Keyboard works on Mac. SOFTWARE DOESN'T!,The keyboard does a nice job as a usb unit. The packaging does a less than stellar job of clearly stating up front that none of the educational software is written for the Mac.
3,Listen to The Others About the Size,"When I saw everyone compaining about the size-I thought it was all greatly exaggerated.Trust me when I say this though-when I got this thing in the mail today-I put it next to my 18 inch ruler, it's barely half an inch larger. All the keys are crammed into this space-so just imagine for a moment if you could how small that is (especially the black keys!).Reason I didn't completely 1 this is it's still a nice sleek, design and at least operational.These are literally for babyfingers-I think my cat could play this one (would love if he could!) I want to return/resell this one-meanwhile I've invested in a 79 dollars M-AUDIO Keyrig 25, which is just excellent-with full sized keys and serves the purpose I wanted this one to-portable instrument for my laptop."
2,Disappointed,"Purchased this keyboard for my middle school grandson. He is just now taking music in school and shows a real interest. Therefore this seemed to be a good beginning keyboard for the price. It came with 3 software packages. The one is for preschool or younger and works. The other is for someone who knows a lot about keyboards and how to apply them in a computer environment. He was so excited! But the one piece of software that I needed - Music Teacher 3.0 by Evolution will not work on any of our 3 computers. I have spent days trying to locate a patch that would make it 'backwards' compatible. The manuals say it is an easy fix to just go to their website and download the patch. However, Evolution's website bounces you to M-Audio's website and then you end up in a website for AVID. None of which has a patch for this software. I have emailed but no response so I will be sending this item back. We are very disappointed."
2,Not quite as big as the picture,"BE AWARE! This is a misleading advertisement...sure, there's 37 keys. But they forget to tell you the keys are miniature. That's right, 37 keys that are cut in 1/2 which are PERFECT if you're a child or a little person."
2,Delayed note,"My son ordered this to add to his music program. He is 12. He was disappointed that the key board keys were too small and that there was a significant delay before you could hear the note. Overall, the quality of the keyboard did not match the description for which my son based his order."
2,Okay for a basic unit,"I was disappointed that this keyboard does not register key velocity. Other than that, it is fine for what it is. IF all you need to do is trigger sounds, then this is a good travel keyboard."
1,Too small,"My ring finger is a size 3, and these keys were too small for my fingers! I ended up shelling out the $180 for the M-Audio Axiom 25, and returned the ekeys. Definitely not for adults due to its toddler size."
1,"Way too small, horribly cheap feel","If you aren't a toddler you've outgrown thisKeys are exceptionally small, save yourself the money and make a tissue box guitar :P"
4,Use it regularly,"Great recipes and inspiration.The thing I really like about the book is it is a great source for recipes for when you have to go to a potluck, or want travel food,or make party food.I would give it five stars except the editors missed at least one technical detail on the instructions - which is vital on a cookbook.On page 140 the recipe for Samsa misses part of the baking time. It tells you to place then samsas on a baking sheet, tells you to pre-heat the oven, then it jumps forward to glazing the samsas with beaten egg then ""bake for another 20 minutes"". Since they did not say how long they were supposed to have baked before you pulled them out and glazed them, I had to guess that it was 20 minutes as well. (which seemed to have worked).So 4 stars, and double check some of the instructions for anything you want to try, and perhaps make a test batch of anything before you depend on it. The recipes are unique enough to Americans that the book is a keeper."
3,Academic yet interesting,"Anyone interested in Native American Culture should not read this one first. Read the ""Dine History"" and ""Navaho Symbols of Healing"" first. These two books give you a better understanding into the background and history of the Native Americans and their culture. Once you understand ""where they are coming from"" and understand why they do what they do you will then be able to understand how their everyday life and connection with the Earth is part of their religion. It is their religion.This book explores a comparative analysis between Judaism, Christianity and the Navaho religion/culture. There are some definite similarities. You will see where much of our many religions came from and how they sprang up from ""the beginnings"".Written in academic style, it is a bit dry but very very interesting and gives you a true understanding of the Native American, cuts through the Myths and Legends and more."
3,OK Game for the beginner fisherman,"This game lacks the excitement and jilted turns of the normal pc game. However, it is absolutly beautifully desighned, and the graphs are awsome. I would recomend this game for the novist bass-game player. It is a nice four or five weeks worth of entertainment!"
5,It's a great game if you don't have windows XP!,My daughter and I love this game but my only problem with it is that it won't work that well on my computer because I have windows XP and everytime it freezes and I have problems playing it! They said that there is nothing I could do about! I wish they made a fishing game that would work on windows XP but they don't! My daughter and I are very upset! Other then that it is a great game if you don't have windows XP!!
3,"Enjoyable, Strange","I read this book after a friend told me about it. An interesting read about alot of people with regrets in their lives. This is true for all of us, isn't it? So in that snese I found it very realistitc. However the character who was a man who thought he(she?) was a woman was very strange. Truly that one part of it confused me greatly. Therefore, I have to say I wished the author would have excluded Franco. The other characters were very rich and fun to read and I am happy to have done so. I would recommend it, but it is not for children, this is an adult book for sure."
3,Eh...,"This series was okay. I didn't like how it seemed everyone had dealings with the supernatural, and that there was more than one or two vampires in Aurora. I prefered the more realistic account of the seige of New York, where the punches were thrown by characters you knew, not some ancient evil.I'd first recomend The Brujha Clan Novel if you want fiction on Theo Bell."
2,Better Fan-Fiction,"I really wanted to like this book. But it bored me.It seems like World Of Darkness fan-fiction. Not rottenfanfic, but still. Its not very gripping, the charactersare thin cardboard (Delfine, the young naive-yet-spunky-yet-terrified-yet-takecharge vampire is worst, absolutelyunbelievable as a being) and the author doesn't resist thelure of the 'World Of Darkness as a theme park' - whereanything goes, because there is a new conspiracy orsupernatural power to explain everything. Sheesh."
1,When Did Theo Become a Chatterbox?,"Theo Bell's character in the 13-book clan series was taciturn and action-oriented. In this weak three-book series, he never seems to shut his mouth and takes a whole lot of guff he would never have accepted as originally written.Worse, the author invokes the same, tired description of his vision becoming covered with a red haze when he got angry. Yeah, we get it, angry Brujah. Flat, two-dimensional portrayal. Most characters added just to be quickly killed off.Tremendous disappointment, poor writing."
3,"Hey Janet, I've got something to say...","If you're interested in learning how to participate in the Rocky Horror Picture Show experience don't start here...watch the movie about 30 times until you know what's going to happen next. Then buy the special edition DVD and listen to the audience participation feature, then buy the ""Audience Part-tic-i-pation Guide"", THEN get this CD to refine your skills.It's hard to hear what the audience is saying half the time. It's still a staple in your obsessive Rocky Horror collection."
4,Oh dear!,"This is a reliving of the movie experience...without the video ;. The songs are wonderful, clear and just as I remembered. I did have one little problem...perhaps due to my ignorance. But as far as I can see....it IS the movie experience. It's just two LONG tracks (as it's a two-CD album). That would be nice if all I ever wanted was the movie experience, but what about when I just want to listen to my favorite songs?"
4,Its A Great Cd,Well The Frist Time I Seen This Cd I Thught To My Self Hmm Would I Listen To It More Then once And I Had I Have LIstened To My Copy About a hundred And sevenity five times its the best cd investment i ever made. The Drawbacks 1 Track Per Cd means U Listen All the way through or do the so slow fast forward deal also the call Back Lines to inturupt the sound and i know thats what the cd is but they do get tiring after a while but fun for a long drive to work.Adam Forsberg forsberg@mindless.com
5,"The lines are outdated, but it gives a pretty good experience of what The Rocky Horror Picture Show is like in theaters","The title of this review pretty much says it all. I also really like some of the little additional parts added to it. Not only does it create the atmosphere, but it really is an entertaining album to listen to. Although a lot of the lines are outdated, a lot of the lines are pretty funny. I want to keep a lot of the stuff to myself, just because if you haven't heard the album, I want you to be surprised."
1,Ewww,"This bag arrived at my doorstep today and I was very disappointed. The brown is not as pretty as it looks in the picture, and the stitching is messed up in several different places. The bag looks cheap. I am in the process of attempting to return this product and won't order Kalencom prodcuts anymore."
3,Re: EDFA argument,"I am interested in reviews about the book but i am perplexed by the furore as penned in the previous e-mails, having just written that however i would just like to re-iteriate the point made previously that a huge amount of in-fibre technology development and research work was done at the University of Southampton. NB I haven't used the book yet so ignore the star rating"
4,Excellent Supplement for SAT,"This book is excellent whether you are studying for the SATs or refreshing your English grammar. It presents all information from the very basics of punctuation, quotation marks, to harder grammar. In addition, the exercises included are very thorough, with every chapter having an overall review.The reason for one star missing is that the content of the exercises tries too hard to be funny which is a little distracting from the grammar itself."
4,A Fun Book,"In this time of social media abbreviations, it's nice to have something to practice the basics. Presented in typical Dummies format, there's plenty of humor. Choose the area in which you wish to improve. There's a section for each of the major categories of grammar and punctuation. Even for people that write a lot, this book is a good resource. Not sure when a comma or semi-colon is appropriate? This book explains it clearly and gives one the opportunity to practice. There is even an extra practice section at the end of each chapter for overachievers.There's also a chapter dedicated to commonly misused, and confused, words. One of my pet peeves is when people use the word ""looser"" instead of ""loser"".I enjoyed the humor by the author and, yes, I think the book is a fun way to brush up on the ole writing skills."
1,Very annoying,"The annoying witticisms and endless sarcasm only interrupted my concentration. I found the book hard to follow. Especially after her giving examples, correcting them, and finding out it was her feeble attempt at humor. After a while I just threw the book away. Buy any other book on the subject."
5,Wonderful review of American and British Grammar,"English Grammar Workbook For Dummies (For Dummies (Language & Literature))This book, with its companion 'English Grammar for DUMMIES', are wonderful tools for those of us who need to refresh our skills. I highly recommend this book for native speakers of the English language, and for those whom speak English as a second language. The author's ability of explaining the English language grammatical rules, in my opinion, is fantastic."
2,Forced humor. Forced witticisms. Enough is enough.,At first I overlooked the author's style of forced jokes and inane tongue in cheek remarks. I wanted to get to the nuts and bolts of grammar. However after about an hour of enduring this juvenile writing style I decided to stop wasting my time. Of late I have come across many 'academic' books that tend to condescend to the reader by using silly jokes and childish sarcasm to bolster the learning process. It works when the jokes are used sparingly. In this case the author went overboard. Give me something that respects my time and needs.
4,"Good compilation for its era, but get Utopia's, too","This is a good place to start for Todd Rundgren/Utopia collectors.It has most of the essential hits and key album tracksthat the casual listener would want.But for those who'd want to dig deeper(or already have,like me), it's still enough to whet your appetite.I would've liked to see some of the 'Faithful' coverversions (especially the note-for-note 'Good Vibrations')appear here, but that's a minor complaint."
4,I don't want to work,"This is a decent overview of Todd Rundgren's career, not including his work with Utopia. It features most of his best known songs, although it curiously doesn't include his hit cover version of ""Good Vibrations"". (I guess they decided to only include songs Todd wrote himself.) How much you get out of this collection depends on how much you like Todd Rundgren. I tend to like his earlier stuff better than his later stuff, although the more recent stuff does have it's merits. Recommended to people looking for a sampler of Todd's work."
2,Nice pictures but..,...there is absolutely nothing on construction. It's a coffee table book at best!
3,Not a how to book,"If you are wanting ideas for your pool, this is a good book, just wasn't what I was looking for. Pretty pictures and not much how to."
5,Hank finally gets a grip.,"I stopped reading Henry's books after""Now Watch Him Die"", which aided my downward spiral into the black hole of depression. Now 5 years and thousands of dollars worth of therapy later, I tentively reached out to the writings of dear old Henry. I came away from this experience with one MAJOR thought(and lots of smaller, yet more important ones). That thought was: I NEVER WANT TO BE FAMOUS. Another thought was, this guy needs some friends. Anyway, a prime book, by one of the greatest ""see-ers"" of this generation. Somehow, this book was more caustic than past works, but it was not so blatant. Please read this book, then read Henry Miller..."
3,Rollins is cool,I enjoy his writing style... It is very vivid and to the point. The only reason im giving it three stars is that a lot of what he writes of in this book makes me horribly depressed.
2,Ugh.,This book was just terrible. It felt like I was reading the diary of a whiny teenaged girl. I opened it expecting a bold statement of an individual standing above the masses; I got one hundred and fifty pages about Henry Rollins' mommy issues.
3,hmmm...old hat?,"now let me first preface this by saying that henry's my boy. i read everything he puts out. this doesn't match up to his past rants. there's very little evidence of his sense of humor and at times the work seems strained. make better use of your time and reread ""Bang"", get ahold of the original 21361 or, better yet, see him live."
4,read it,"good read... not one i didn't want to put down thoughrollins can make the most bizarre metaphorical comparisons,some really grabbed my attention and were worth the read alone..others were almost retarded and too jumbled; id rather of spent time doing something else..^thats pretty much itgood insight , seems to be a bit bias sometimessee for yourself..yeh over neh"
1,Dear God,"Remember when you were a kid, scribbling angry and depressing thoughts into a journal in your room? Remember 15 minutes later when you stopped doing that because you knew you'd be embarrassed by it later? Hank skipped the last step and published the journal instead. This stream-of-barely-consciousness is the literary equivalent of a toddler throwing a temper tantrum in a grocery store; devoid of logic, impervious to reason and totally unpleasant. Avoid with purpose!"
4,Rollins at it again,I've found this book to be a refreshing change from the rest of the stuff out there. Solipsist is one of Rollin's best works.
5,These guys are GREAT,We just love this singing group and were thrilled to hear that they had another DVD out beyond their Christmas DVD. The seller gave us excellent service; everything arrived on time in good shape. Thanks.
4,Great but not excellent,"I'll start my saying i found this book very enjoyable. It does a lot of things good but not great. There is snipits of information but certain subjects warrant more that 3 or 4 pages to accuratly describe how to do certain things, but seeing as how this book in for educational purposes only it does a fair job in making you aware of how things might work. However don't think that this is the end all be all book to how do make or do something. For example creating a new identiy/life by falsifying records/or staging a death is pretty ridiculous in todays high tech and wired world.Again good but not great"
2,"How do you say, ""Disappointing?""","The book is alright, but the information that's even remotely interesting is few and far between. I just expected more, I guess. I'm just disappointed because much of this book was fluff, and not in-depth knowledge."
3,Just touched on the basics.,"I was hoping for alot more detail. Some things were covered adequately however other topics were barely covered. Either way, both volumes are a good read for the adventurer, but just know that certain books shouldn't be cut down."
3,"A ton of information, and a little bit of bull","Ragnar seems to be trying to please the public, and does just that. The only problem is, he compromises his integrity somewhat by sliding in inaccurate information, wild guesses (or so it seems), and adhering to popular myth and misinformation: polystyrene and gasoline do NOT makae napalm, and I don't care if you call it 'homemade' or not, THAT'S NOT C-4!"
2,Over-hyped,"This book, and those like it, are supposedly for the ""Thinking Man."" Would the thinking man please explain how you can be given the measures (how to drop out of sight) and the counter-measures (how to find someone who has) in the same book? There is useful information, but it must be gleaned from information that sounds better than it works. My fear is people will be injured from attempting some of this and be be too embarresed to revel the source of the misinformation."
1,Statistical Methods,"As a beginner statistician, the layout of this book is very difficult to follow. It did not explain well the procedures or examples in the text. I do not recommend this book to a beginner, or to anyone not already experienced in statistics."
5,The Original Jass...,".Jass--(or Jazz, as it's now known)--is America's original art-form.Jazz got its start in the American Deep-South Gulf Coast region affectionately known as Dixie.Here we have the best of Americana in the form of original ensemble Dixieland Jazz.A classic set, recorded in San Francisco on 18 June 1953.Part of the same session asHello Central...Give Me Doctor Jazz."
5,"Superb, Fizzes along from opening to glorious end",Shotgun Messiah were definately one of the best bands around the start of the nineties and this album represents their finest moments. Buy it!!!
2,Ehhhhhh,"It was ok...there's a few good songs on it....my favorite Shotgun Messiah cd is Violent New Breed. It was awesome as hell. If anyone has, or knows where to get this cd PPLLEEAASSEE email me Dethgrl4x4@aol.com"
4,This album KICKS A$$!!!!!,"I grew up listen to Hard Rock and Metal....And this is one of my favorite albums...it's got hooks, riffs, and attitude...enough said....if you like Metal or Hard Rock, GET THIS!!!!!"
5,Answered many prayers,"My husband took his life. I have been asking why. I got some answers going thru papers after he died. (We were married for 3 years but, because of jobs and needing to sell a house - we lived in different states.) But, I still had many whys. I wasn't 100% convienced he was in heaven. This book answered a lot of whys for me & assured me my husband is in heaven. Then gave me a way to heal my hurts and doubts. If you need a book to help you thru a suicide- this is the best one I read. I recommend it highly and I am sorry for your loss. But, God is good- it is not a coincidence you are wondering if this book can help you. It can help you move beyond the grief and dispair. But, you have to make that choice. Mr. Cox will give you the tools and God's word on it. You will be blessed by this book."
3,Somewhat helpful material,"While this book was somewhat helpful after my father's suicide, I found ""Grieving a Suicide"", by Albert Hsu, to be much more helpful from a Christian perspective. I noticed that most of the reviews I read here(although there were exceptions) were posted by counselors or those who were not necessarily suicide survivors. So, what I'm saying is that ""Aftershock"" is a great reference book for a counselor, and helpful to read for a survivor, but I would first read ""Grieving a Suicide"" or something similar."
4,Great Album !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have this album all the songs are dope. The cd never came out in the states. They should've put more tracks on the album only ten is not eought, but if you don't have it get it."
5,perfect!,this is only one of my FAVOURITE albums! you cant get sick of it...every song on there is good...im serious!
4,Todd,Todd is in my top 3 Todd Rundgren Albums. A must have for any Todd Rundgren fan. You won't be dissapointed.
3,I wonder if it's there.,"When I bought the ""A Wizard, A True Star"" LP in '73 it contained a postcard that was to be sent in with your name printed on it. There was supposed to be a ""surprise"" in the next album. The next album was this one, ""Todd"", and it contained a rather large poster comprised of all the names people had sent in. Mine was among them. As far as the album was concerned, it certainly wasn't something you could dance to. Of course, if you knew anything about Todd Rundgren's music at the time, dancing was the last thing to be considered. Regardless of the eccentricity of the albums he produced as a musician, Rundgren was a first rate record producer in his time. I wonder if the poster was reproduced for the CD."
2,Todd's hair color takes precedence over tunes.,"Anyone thinking this then-double LP was going to be Something/Anything Part II was in for a big disappointment back in '74. With only a handful of Todd gems (Don't You Ever Learn, The Last Ride, A Dream Goes On Forever, Useless Begging) and a ton of throw-away bombast and synthesizer twiddle, Todd seemed to be paying more thought to his hair color than to his songwriting. ""I think you know..."" he sings on the first cut. Wrong, Todd. Fact is, we're totally confused."
1,What happened?,"I have all of Todds solo stuff & Utopia too and I really don't like this record. There are no songs of the calibre of Can We Still Be Friends or Zen Archer and too many 'hey, i'm on LSD' mess around in the studio type affairs. It's kind of like Todds White Album or Physical Graffitti but without being any good. Go and buy Faithful / Runt or anything else really. Except Ra by Utopia coz that's pretty dubious too.Sorry! Todd is still god but this one just does not hit home."
4,Christmas gift,"I bought this for my brother in law for christmas, he loved it. He is a major hunter and hard to buy for."
2,Reissue of Votes/Guns,"2 stars is not a judgment on the quality of this work. No, the low rating is due to the misleading title of the book. As an earlier reviewer suspected, this book simply is a ""revised and updated"" version of ""Our Votes, Our Guns"" -- which I already own! Needless to say, I would not have purchased this book had I known that. Yes there is a small footnote on the BACK OF THE BOOK, but you don't see that until the book arrives.Furthermore, Meredith doesn't even provide and introduction telling one just what parts he has updated or revised. I'm sure this version contains valuable commentary on events since the earlier book, but there's no easy way to find the new material.Overall I'm sure the book still is a valuable introduction to the insanity that is the Mugabe regime (that's why I gave it 2 stars rather than 1). If, however, you have read the earlier ""Our Votes, Our Guns,"" save your money and wait for ""Dinner with Mugabe"" to be released."
4,Too late for many,"As usual with Mr Meredith, a well written and researched book. Had he written this earlier and I had read it earlier I would not have held on to living in Zimbabwe, hoping for a change. At the end of the day, the leopard Mugabe has not changed his spots but has demonstrated to the world, that whatever your opinion of him, he is still a master politician. A recommended read for anyone who wants to understand the man or even the convoluted machinations of African politics."
4,Zimbabwe's tragedy,"This book looks at the rule of Robert Mugabe, whose story is unfortunately like so many others in Africa. Having fought against colonialism he became Rhodesia's first, and ONLY, president.This biography looks at his background, his political activities prior to the election which propelled him to power and his seemingly never-ending thirst for personal power, regardless of the cost to his long-suffering people. If you are interested in seeing how a country which once was the bread-basket of southern Africa became gripped in famine and despair, read this book."
4,If you liked the musical - then you will love the album,"It's fun - my oldest wanted this after we watched the MTV premier of the musical. Nothing here will be a classic in 100 years, but if you want a song that will make you chuckle, or pause, then this is an album with a few of those."
2,"Empty, Forgettable Bubblegum Pop Score With Bland Lyrics","I'm probably not going to have a popular ""helpfulness"" rating for this, but I gotta be honest... this show's score is not good. The opening number starts out strong with such a catchy beat and bouncy rhymes, but it's downhill from there. Most of the songs feel empty and forgettable or else have really bland lyrics (I cringed especially during ""Chip on my Shoulder""). And don't even get me started on that pointless ""Ireland"" song. The only song I would really recommend is ""Legally Blonde"" which is a nice ballad. I'm a huge fan of fun, musical comedies. My favorite musical last season was The Wedding Singer, whose score is 10x better than Legally Blonde's. But this show's music (and the show itself) just fall flat."
1,awful,this cd was an impulse buy and a huge mistake. having loved the movie and enjoying musicals i thought it might be fun. instead it was just excruciating. avoid this cd at all costs.
1,Yuck!,"When the Amazon Editorial Review said that the score for this was BETTER than Wicked with Idina Menzel I said to myself 'This must be really good."" Blah! It's AWFUL! The girls' voices are nasally and annoying, the guys' voices are forgettable and bland, and the songs in general are TERRIBLE. It's like mixing the hoakiest of broadway musicals with soul-piercing cheerleader squeals and the instrumentation characteristic of every bad pop song (of which there are many). My advice, spend your money on something which is actually worth buying. No words can describe how bad this musical is."
4,Can't Get the Music Out of Your Head!,"I'd only seen a small part of the film version of ""Legally Blone"" before being given tickets to the musical, but when I came out of the theater singing ""Omigod You Guys,"" I knew I'd have to have the CD! The clever, witty lyrics and hook-filled music will linger in you head for days after listening. Even if you haven't seen the show, the music stands on its own with fun, mostly upbeat numbers."
4,Legally Blonde Soundtrack,"Arrived promptly but with a cracked case. None the less, I am pleased with my purchase and product in general"
4,Elle Woods singing?!?,"Okay so Legally Blonde the musical isn't exactly the most sophisticated Broadway recording you could listen to. The songs are fun and upbeat though, and tell the story easily without even seeing the play. Laura Bell Bundy has a great voice and is a great Elle Woods.These songs will get stuck in your head and after awhile you will definitely start to sing along and feel like dancing!"
2,A Disappointment,"I am a huge fan of Legally Blonde the movie and so I was really excited to see the musical. I almost fell asleep and wanted nothing more than to just leave the theatre. The music is very irritating when you are sitting for 2 hours watching an annoying overacted musical, but when it comes to listening to the soundtrack later i must admit it does work as a great upbeat workout soundtrack."
3,Better than Wicked? Not hardly.,"This musical is cute and entertaining, but the music is complex and full of strange chord changes, making only parts of it singable by us everyday folk.Wicked, on the other hand, has more memorable and singable numbers and feels richer and less brassy. Overall, Wicked has the better score.That being said, after watching the recent search for an Elle Woods replacement on Bravo, I think the new Elle Woods (Bailey) is going to bring a better energy and singing quality to the character. I am hoping she will be even more successful and record a soundtrack. I'm just not a big fan of Laura Bell Bundy's voice."
3,It all sounds alike,"Where to begin... Do I review the actual show, or the quality of the C.D.? For the most part, the show was one cute song after another same-sounding cute song. The only two stand-outs are WHIPPED INTO SHAPE, but mostly because the woman playing the workout video queen jumps rope while belting out this number -- truly amazing! The other standout number is THERE! RIGHT THERE! (or IS HE GAY OR EUROPEAN).As for the packaging of the C.D. it is good. I do love it when you get all of the lyrics in the cover booklet as you do here. The photos are nice too. But if you're looking for a great musical, buy West Side Story."
1,Anthology: Frank Valli & the Four Seasons,I received the cd on time but it was practically useless to me. It was a copy and only plays on my computer - not on my cd player in the car or on my home theater.
4,outstanding c.d.,"as i searched for a four season's collection, i had been dissapointed in the past,but not with this one.the top hits from the 60's through to the 70's are all there.for the value,this is the best one of the bunch."
1,Crap,This thing is a piece of crap. The head was broken before I even opened the box. Couldn't fix it. Waste of money.
4,Really fun,"Bought this gift for my daughter who is a psychology major. She has it on her desk at work and loves it. People comment on how awesome it is. The only bad thing was it arrived with it's head off. I put it back on, but it seems a bit tipsy."
4,Nice set,"The contrasting wood stains are very pretty. The case closure is slightly difficult to close: both lids have to be exactly aligned, or the latch won't shut. Overall, a really nice looking set."
2,Uncle Mike's Products,"I liked this holster at first; it did what I wanted and the price was right. However, over time whatever the material is it MELTED! Then the crap got all over my gun. It was a mess. I would NEVER buy any Uncle Mike's products ever again! Spend the extra few bucks and get a quality product."
4,Nice holster,This fits my Ruger 9mm very well. It is comfortable to wear. I spent a day outside hiking trails in 90+ temps. Forgot the pistol was there. Material absorbed perspiration but pistol was dry. Good holster for the price.
3,Not very big,"This is a very well made inside the pants holster, but it wasn't quite large enough for my Taurus PT709 Slim. I ripped part of the seam out so that the trigger guard would fit further into the holster. I think that will work fine. I would like to have a better description of the size before ordering Uncle Mike's holsters in the future. I received delivery in a few days via Parcel Post."
3,"good quality, bad sizing chart","Bought this for my Springfield XD-40 Subcompact that has a 3"" barrel. Doesn't fit. Uncle Mikes chart says this is for 3""-3 1/2"" sub compact autos. The trigger guard catches at the seam, doesn't go inside. Not safe at all. Considering returning or keeping it for a possible future smaller gun."
2,Not what they used to be,"A dozen years ago I bought my first Uncle Mike's products. Although not completely worn out I thought it was time to get a new set of holsters for a couple firearms. Wow - the quality has gone way, way downhill. The stitching is uneven with sloppy finishing and they've done something to the plastic belt loop/retaining clip. The plastic is too soft and pliable on this and the sidekick holster I also returned. It ""gives"" way too much and thus isn't as solid feeling on the hip. Also, flipped my old model (which I will now covet) over and notice it was made in the USA whereas the new ones are made in Vietnam. I'd much rather pay extra for quality workmanship, materials, and made in the USA. I give it two stars because, yes, they are inexpensive holsters that do fit a wide variety of firearms and will get the job done. But they are not what they used to be."
5,Inexpensive and light,Fits a Rossi 461 perfect. Adds no weight when carrying. Clip on holster can handle use and is quite comfortable.
2,"Belt clip very weak, major flaw - for min. light use only.","This is the second Uncle Mike's I bought. They appear to be made well and represent a good value for the most part. This particular model IWB would be 4 or 5 stars if the belt clip provided more security. Uncle Mike's uses a plastic clip without any spring to it. It relies completely on the little ""L"" hook on the bottom to hold it to your belt. Unfortunately it does not do that very well at all.Because of the clip, I'd suggest another manufacture for this model as the design flaw is a big one. That said, the construction of the holster itself appears to be of good quality using a soft fabric which is non abrasive against skin or clothing- which is a plus. I also purchased Uncle Mike's inside the pocket at the same time so I don't yet know how they will wear. I am very happy with the ITP holster. I'll add to my review after I've had a chance to use them a bit more."
4,wrong size due to manufacturer's lame table of sizes,i only put 4 stars since i got the wrong size.Not amazons fault but uncle mike and his chart on holster sizes.
5,Great Little Holster,"Great product at a great price. I needed an inside my pants holster for my Ruger LCP. The material is soft so it doesn't rub your side raw. The inside ( next to skin) of the holster is higher and keeps the gun away from direct contact of skin.The outer edge is lower , so you can remove gun easily. I don't know how long it will hold up , but for the price, you can afford to replace yearly. Uncle Mike is known for well made and thought out products. Remember , they make right handed and left handed holsters. If you intend to place holster in the small of your back, be sure to order the opposite ."
5,another great item from Amazon,The holster was exactly the right fit for my Charter arms bulldog 44sp. It is well made and does just what I expected it to. It is a very good holster for concealed carry.
1,calling it a holster is generous,"this was purchased for a 2"" rossi 461. not the easiest gun to find a holster for. the only positive thing about it is that it was better than simply tucking the gun into my waistband. it is a pouch with a plastic clip. a clip that broke after the third day. it is what it is but using a metal clip would have made it a usable product and not a regret."
3,Good Enough,This is a cheap holster. It is good enough to get the job done (holding a gun). It is mostly used in my wife's purse so it keeps the gun upright in her purse.
2,Not for the Big Boys,"Holster rides high w/grip 4"" above belt. This is caused by Belt clip being attached much too low on the holster. Would have been alot better if belt clip was attached along the top of the holster and a security strap intalled. Holster not recommended for beer bellor's w/love handles, grips hangs out of the holster with no security strap to keep gun from slipping out. Fits 4"" 9mm gun perfectly and the materials are soft and strudy. Great holster, but needs minor adjustments."
3,Would have been okay,Arrived with the stitching that holds the clip onto the holster ripped. I've had uncle mikes stuff before and this seems much cheaper than normal. If I had seen this in a flea market I would think it was a fake.It's the 5th thing I've had to return to Amazon in the last month....
2,you tube,"this went to dvd but was a home video that should have stayed home.High point her family support,A plus Mom and Dad."
2,"Decent shelf, for $20 at K Mart.","While this is a nice enough shelf, it's over presented and over priced here. It's screw together plastic uprights and poorly laminated chipboard. The lamination was even pulling away at the corners when it took it out of the box. You can get something similar at any chain store for half the price."
4,"finally, a winner!","One of the most easy-to-read, practical guides on media relations published in the last decade or two. A great primer for business executives who want to understand how the press really works, for entry-level public relations pros and perhaps even journalists."
5,The perfect day-to-day city knife,"KISS stands for Keep it Simple Stupid. But there is nothing ""simple""-looking about this beautiful knife. It is a work of art unlike anything I have ever seen. Traditional folding knives fold into a handle, but the KISS folds on the outside of the handle. Although the blade is exposed, it is sharpened and shaped in such a way to lie flat against the handle. So it's perfectly safe to clip to your pocket. As for use, it should provide a lifetime of light-duty use. Perfect for opening packages, cutting plastic ties, or most anything else you encounter in your daily modern civilized existence. This thing is solid and comes out of the box sharp! And it opens like butter. I received my first KISS knife as a gift, but lost it after a couple of years. I missed it so much that I bought myself another one from Amazon. I will NOT lose this one. Highly recommended knife for those who like their blades to be exceptional and out of the ordinary."
5,Great knife,"I have never had more people ask about a knife and want to look at it, it is very different looking, some call it scary, because of the external blade style, it does take a little getting used to, as the serrated blade can be felt even when closed, again because of the external blade design, I like it a lot and use it a lot!"
2,Blade came loose in my pocket,"After using this as a keychain knife for about 2 weeks, I noticed that the blade, which is supposed to be mounted flush to the handle, had begun to pull away from the handle, leaving the possibility of me slicing my hand when I reach in my pocket for my keys. Eventually it got worse and I tried to fix the problem by tightening the torx screw (that didn't even have loctite on it) that holds the blade to the handle. All this did was make it a little bit better, but a LOT harder to open, and eventually it started loosening and pulling away again. Trashing this knife - I got aBenchmade Pardue Design Combo Edge Knifewhich is amazing. It's bigger, but is lighter, and fully encloses the blade. It's an amazing knife, as can be expected from Benchmade."
4,Not Exactly Low Fat,The book is wonderfully written and is very entertaining. I was disappointed that most of the recipes barely qualify as low fat with up to 30% of the calories from fat.
5,You will never know this is low-fat,"Trying to cook healthy for my family used to be a big fight and other cookbooks used to use ingredients that you had to find in health food stores and speciality stores...where this cookbook, every recipe is fabulous...so good that I lost 50lbs and everyone in the family eats the food...especially the most finicky eater in the bunch...and the ingredients can be found at your local supermarket...this is a must have book"
5,Excellent replacement part,"This tensioner works much better than oem. However, when installed there was no hole drilled for a factory installed shield that was attached to the original tensioner. Easy fix, just drill hole in new one. Worked great. No more squeal, when used with a new gatorback belt."
2,"Good, but the conclusions are inconsistent","Mr. Powledge makes good points on the ailments of federally-funded urban revitalization efforts. He shows how the poor stayed poor, New Haven CT stayed depessed, crime rose, and things got worse all as millions of federal and local dollars were being spent on the city.But then he takes a big step in the wrong direction: he comes out with a immensely favorable view of Mayor Lee - the man who directed all the bad programs and still thought they were successful. Powledge would do better to realize that the Mayor's old-guard paternalism was destructive for the city's revitalization; Lee directed and planned when he should have allowed people to build their own lives."
4,Good sheets,"They do crackle quite a bit. They are getting softer now with the washings. A good deal for the price. By the way, 4 stars from me means that the product is good but nothing to jump up and down about."
2,I wish these fit!,"Purchased this sheet set as the description stated that it would fit deep mattress. As with every other sheet set I have purchased for the deep mattress, the fitted sheet does fit OK. However, if one wants to tuck in the flat sheet on one side of the mattress, there is hardly any sheet left to cover the bed! I guess that deep mattress sheet sets will always be ""short-sided"" on the flat sheet until manufacturers begin making an oversize flat sheet, too. I am, none the less, disappointed."
3,Disappointing,"Not nearly as soft as I expected, rather rough. The plum is not very purple-y, has more gray in it. The price was decent though and the pockets are very deep."
1,strange sheets,The quality was disappointing and does not compare with my old 200-thread-count 100% cotton percale sheets which were made in the USA (unfortunately the American factories are now closed). The sheets are VERY thin and do not have the softness or body of 100% cotton. I ordered white sheets and the set that arrived was cream colored and yellowed. A bleach wash removed some of the yellow. I would not buy this product again nor do I recommend it. I think Amazon should state that the sheets are made in China. I need 100% cotton because I have an allergy problem with synthetics such as polyester. I hope these sheets are all cotton but the thinness is reminescent of polyester. Hope I am wrong.
2,Good For The Guest Bedroom,"I will definitely be only using these sheets for guest. The sheets color is great, but with regard to comfort, they are the worst sheets I have slept on. The sheet are really rough and remind me of sleeping on a paper bag."
3,sunny,not bad over all. i cant really be picky because its impossible to find very deep pocket sheets at a decent price. the sheets are a little rough but the pocket depth is awesome.
5,sheets,"Good bargain. Cal king sheets are expensive and hard to find. These do not pop off the corners, well fitted and soft."
3,"Nice material, mediocre fit","The material is nice, but for a ""expensive"" sheet, it could've been a little softer (more like regular cotton, n less like laminated cheap satin). But u can tell the material seems durable, n comfortable enough to sleep on. The fit on my regular queen mattress was disappointing, since it seems this sheets r specially fitted for pillow top, extra thick queen mattresses; looks like the mattress borrowed sheets from a bigger king mattress brother. Even though I didn't returned them, I wouldn't buy any more, or recommend them."
2,Bad buy,"Not worth it at all, I dont like the feel of the sheets, they are hard and it feels like I am sleeping on paper, they get crushed when they come out of the dryer, wont recommend it to anyone."
2,Loud Sheets,"After about 10 washings, the sheets were working up to being soft. The biggest problem we had is they are LOUD. Everytime you roll over they make such crinkling noises. My husband is a light sleeper, so I finally had to buy different sheets."
2,Noisy & Rough,I ordered 2 sets and I am returning one today. I've washed the other set at least 3x already thinking perhaps they'll become softer with each washing ... but no luck.They are actually so stiff that they make alot of noise!
1,Don't buy,"The only good thing about this product is that the color was nice. The fabric was incredibly stiff, crunchy, and noisy. I thought washing it would help, but it's still came out extremely stiff. I would return it but it's already been washed. At $34.99, it's a horrible deal. The only thing about the set that is being used is the fitted sheet...the pillow cases and flat sheet are way to noisy to use and especially sleep on. Don't buy this product."
2,Not Very Impressed,"I used these sheets twice, and then got rid of them. They make so much noise it's ridiculous."
3,Study Guide,It wasn't like other study guides I've gotten. There wasn't a final test and the review questions were lengthy and too wordy. I ended up using them but changing the questions around and creating my own work sheets from the questions in the book. The review at the end of the book was good. I used this for an 8th grade class. I would have felt better if I had high schoolers using it instead.
4,"""A Day No Pigs Would Die"" Study Guide","The product came quickly. Some of the constructed responses had too much of a religious slant, but were easily adaptable to fit a public school setting."
1,Don't waste your money or your time!,"this book must be for the truly dumb or brain dead because it is nothing more than a verbose version of the information that is contained within Ebay and Ebay's help menus for free. Any extra information I actually got from this book could fit onto a post it note with lots of room to spare. If you have bought or sold on ebay for more than a few weeks, don't waste your money on this book.As for mine, yep you guessed it. Its going up for sale on Ebay :)"
1,Embarrassing...,"If you'd like a 15-minute summary of every single tip in this book, give me a call:(847) 475-0676I can't even believe a book this obvious exists!Thanks, Patrick"
1,Don't buy this!,"Do you have trouble tieing your shoes? Are you unable to butter toast? Have you ever hit your head on a steel bar and were unable to remember anything for two months after? If so, you may need Ebay for Dummies if you intend to carry out any online auctioning."
4,Great for beginners & as a handy reference!,"This book is great for beginners - there's nothing like flipping through a book to find answers quickly instead of wading through an online site. And even experienced eBayers will find the book handy to have on hand. (But if you have been doing eBay for 2 years, you probably don't need the book, so what are you doing here anyway??)I think this book will get more people involved in online auctions, and they will be better informed, which is a good thing for everyone with something to sell on eBay!"
5,Goodbye Bobby but thanks for the music,"This is a superb collection. I wanted to write this to thank reviewer Dave Hatton listed previously. Being an old top forty dj I always had my personal favorites regardless of how the tunes were doing on the Billboard Hot 100 and would occasionaly sneak them onto the playlist. One of my all time favorites was ""melancholy music man"" when the group was on the verve label. It's still my favorite. I didn't find out about Bobby's death until this week and had to pull these discs out and play them one more time. Thanks Bobby! Hope I see and hear you in ""rock and roll heaven"" and thanks Dave of NH for being on the same page."
5,The Best Shirt Ever!!!!,"This is my son's favorite shirt. We are going to order more and more from this company. The quality of the shirt is very high, meaning is is greatly comfortable and durable. Not a cheap cra__y pice of material.And of course the graphics on the shirt is just plain AWESOME!!"
1,Dont waste your money,"This article is available for free, just do a search, you'll find it in five minutes."
3,Downloading issues,"I have read almost everything Tami Hoag has written. When this was downloaded onto my Kindle, there are ALOT of misspellings and words in the wrong order. I am new to the Kindle thing but this was a first for me. I don't mind the romance novels she writes, but her mysteries are better."
4,good read,Enjoyed this book a lot. I am a new reader of Tami hoag but I think I have a new favorite author to follow.
3,'Not the best I've read',"Sarah's Sin by Tami Hoag is not one of her best efforts. Get it at the library, don't buy it."
3,Sarah's Sin,I thought it was a good story and I enjoyed it but Ms. Hoag has written better. I thing I'm just used to her mysteries and really enjoy them.
2,pass,"111 vvvv posi eerts babbbb I did not like the book to silly and predictable eeeerrrt cccoottd 11111 mmdorfd ,"
4,Very Sweet Novel,"This was a very good read, very sweet. However my only problem was with the amount of typos in the book. Was there no editor?"
2,Pretty okay,"Tami Hoag has a nice way with words and i found that this story was very heartwarming and nice to sit down and read if you intend to feel warm and fuzzy inside. however, this story was a bit sexual and stupid. I mean, this sophisticated big city guy says to a lowly amish girl that he's not sure how to pleasure her when he's been with at least 10 women! DUMB!!!"
2,I'M GLAD SHE CHANGED HER STYLE,"I read ""Cry Wolf"", ""Guilty as Sin"", ""Night Sins"" and ""Thin Dark Line"" before I read this one and I'm sure glad Tami found mysteries to write about. I'm not a lover of romance novels and didn't even finish this book. I guess I expected this book to be the same as the others. Not so!"
4,Very enjoyable!,"This had to be a pre-runner of Tami's mystery writing and, as fictional romance goes, I thoroughly enjoyed it. This story covers two totally different people, from different backgrounds and cultures who come together to find the two things they need most - LOVE and getting over the hurdle of being ""different"". Sarah, a young Amish widow, trying to understand her ""non-Amish"" feelings and yearnings, who works at a local country inn. Matt, a cosmopolitan doctor from the 'big city', who is recouperating at his sister's inn from injuries. They meet. and, although forbidden by her religion, they fall in love and try to hide their feelings. What better way to spend a rainy day, than to curl up with this book?"
4,Good Gospel Recordings are Hard to Find,"Oleta Adams sings beautifully as always. She was obviously raised in the gospel church, and it comes thru on this recording. She has a wonderful sound, and the music is contemporary, but it doesn't stray far from the traditional gospel sound. I generally like large choirs, but nothing is missing here. The arrangements are fantastic, and the feel of gospel is wonderful. Oleta Adams is one of my favorites. She can perform anything, and this record demonstrates a musical genre that is closest to her."
5,Absolutely Awesome!!!!,Oleta was obviously inspired from above. Her work just keeps getting better all the time. I highly recommend this to everyone.
2,Too spiritual,"I had two of Oleta's other albums and ordered this one hoping that it would be equally pleasing. I was not aware that it consists almost entirely of religious selections; there's nothing wrong with that, but I wanted more of her lyrical love songs. I would recommend this album only to those seeking spiritual music."
4,Too simplistic for the age range given,"The reading level for this book is given as ages 9-12, but the fairytale-simplicity of the retelling of the stories makes this collection much more appropriate for the *under 9* age group. The stories are sanitary enough to read to very young children. The part of the collection I found most useful for my 12 year old who is currently studying the Middle Ages, was the notes in the back of the book. ""Notes on the Stories"" tells the background and time period of each story and a brief bio of the author (when known). ""Story Forms of Medieval Times"", ""Some Early Peoples of Western Europe"", ""Time Periods"", ""Words Related to Medieval Times"", and ""The Evolution of the English Language"" are all very brief (total of 3 1/2 pages for all) but informative."
2,Nothing You Couldn't Have Found On Your Own,"As a current applicant to the Americorps NCCC I bought this book looking for something that would convey perhaps a slightly more thorough understanding of the various elements of the Americorps program. Unfortunately this is not exactly the book for this. There are about 13 or so pages with project profiles that were written by members of various Americorps projects, unfortunately these ""essays"" (which typically run from half a page to about a page) don't really go into any real depth. In fact, some are so lifeless you could probably get the same value from reading the descriptions provided by the programs you are looking into on the Americorps website (americorps.gov). After this small collection of essays is about 100+ pages of program listings with contact information which, as far as I'm concerned, is totally obsolete as this same information can be readily accessed on the internet for free. Save your two dollars and just look on the web."
3,Three propaganda movies,The DVD contains three propaganda short movies. The two movies from them are Russians and third one is German. Russian movies are made from an occasional footage available at the moment of making movie and represent a poor or nothing of a structured story jumping from one place and time to another without connecting logic of plane development. That gives you a feeling as you are going through photo album with live pictures and leaves you a little bit unsatisfied. German movie is trying to sell you a jolly Newsreel story made by Josef Goebbels propaganda machine. It is made not great but professionally and served the purpose. Actually I have not seen anything worth to pay for on this DVD. For propaganda purposes the most disturbing film frames are filtered off in these ones. The given footage of all three movies has been appeared in other documentaries.Also you have no chance to see this amazing picture from a DVD cover.
2,Don't waste your time,Don't waste your time on this dvd.....old wartime propaganda documentary....poor quality footage and content. I was very disappointed in this dvd.
1,Just a friendly word of warning:,"L & H filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in December 2000.Their products are usually good, and their people do their best to support them. The algorithms are sound."
1,The rationale for IE lingustics is all wrong,"(...)The origins of IE linguistics lie in the racist and the imperialst environment of 19th century Europe. A hypothetical language is constructed by ignoring masses of inconvenient linguistic, geological and archaeological evidence. A super race of people are suppseed to have spread this language all over Eurasia. Yet no such language or race has ever been found. The so called linguistic evidence is malleable enough to postulate any homeland.(...)"
5,Pride and Prejudice,"This version of Pride and Prejudice is elegant, well done and totally enjoyable. What I especially like is the how true it is to Jane Austin's book. In addition, the actors, especially Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, are perfect for their roles."
5,Wonderful!,This has to be my favorite video adaption based on Pride and Prejudice. Mr Darcy and Lizzie are performed wonderfully. Especially Mr. Darcy. Wonderful! WONDERFUL!
5,Just Like the Book,The dialouge paralells Austen's in the book. The acting is amazing and the characters' roles performed to perfection. Not often that you find a film that does such a thoughtful adaptation of the literary work.
4,The best,"Would give this 5 stars if it came with a download license. Was very disappointed to discover after the purchase that you could not download to at least one device.Otherwise, the series is excellent."
5,Fabulous adaption.,I found it thoroughly entertaining. Well acted by a cast that was suited for each role.The costumes and scenery were gorgeous
5,Excellent rendition,"One of the best renditions of Austen. The mini series gives the time a classic like this needs to understand the true brilliance of her writing Excellent acting, beautiful scenery and time period props. Highly recommend. Everyone should fall in love with Elizabeth and Darcy."
5,Perfect casting!,"This version of the classic novel is by far the best ever produced. The casting was perfect, the director is excellent and the adaptation of the book to a script was almost funnier than the book!"
5,Simply the best! As delicious to watch today as when it first came out.,"Although I enjoyed the more-recent Keira Knightley version, especially the piano music, and adored Matthew McFadyen (SP?) as Darcy, the 1995 miniseries is the cream of the crop, in my humble opinion."
3,Ehh. No way is this better than the Kiera Knightely and Matthew Macfadyen version.,It was slow moving and not as romantic. I didnt hate it but I didnt love it either. I wish the characters blended better!
5,Better than the new movie by FAR,"Keira Knightly's performance in the new movie has nothing on Jennifer Ehle's in this one. This version is closer than the book, and is one of my favorite movies. If you love Pride and Prejudice, you can't not adore this movie."
3,Adequate,"I really don't like these strings much. They're nice for the price, but it leaves much to the imagination. The tone quality is average, somewhat muddy. What I really don't like about them is that they took the volume out of my guitar. I had a loud, explosive guitar, and with these strings on I was left with about 80% the volume. For un-mic'd performances, this is undesirable."
5,best yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is the best splinter cell yet. I never really liked the other ones. But this one is awesome.I think you should buy it.
3,Warning on Wylam drawings,"Many of the drawings in this book are done by William Wylam, who is absolutely notorious for creating gorgeous, detailed, and totally wrong drawings. Do not under any circumstances use his drawings as reference for scale building projects."
5,CUANDO MI HIJO MAYOR ME DIJO,"""¡Tengo derecho a vivir mi vida!""levanté la mano para darle un bofetón...pero interpuso este libro, y me dijo: ""Cuando lo hayas leído, pégame todo lo que quieras, papá !""La sorpresa me paralizó...y cuando quise, Frank Jr. ya se había ido a la escuela.Me senté a leer lel libro ( que de entrada me cayó mal por el título ) y comprendí lo que mi hijo quería decir...Y QUE TENÍA RAZÓN... Este libro le enseña a los jóvenes y también a sus padres, EL RESPETO POR LOS DERECHO MUTUOS, DE LOS HIJOS Y DE SUS PADRES !y LA VERDAD INSOSLAYABLE DE QUE LLEGA EL DÍA EN QUE LOS CHICOS HACEN O DESHACEN SU VIDA..pero este libro es una extraordinaria orientación para ellos !"
3,Lightweight sweater,"This is a very, very lightweight sweater. Fortunately, I purchased it when it was marked down quite a bit, otherwise, I would have returned it. I purchased the ""rust"" color which actually turned out to be bright red. It is comfortable, but because it is so lightweight, you do need to wear something under it. I ordered a small and it fits perfectly, although the sleeves are a little long. It will be a good sweater to have around for those ""in-between seasons"" days when you need something a little heavier than just a shirt."
1,Too shear for my wife,"Had to return this item, as it was too shear for my wife, and it arrived damaged."
4,Works well :),Sucks all the moisture out of my dog's ears!!! It's great. Makes it easier to gently pull his ear hair by hand. Doesn't hurt him nearly as much and soothes his ears when done. Luvin' this!!! Just which they would sift it better to even out the powder texture - there are small clumps which another brand doesn't have that issue.
2,Could not grab my attention,"I am an avid reader and I have really enjoyed the works of Christian Jacq. Unfortunately, this book drags. I read about half of it and gave up. It just did not seem to have the spark and excitment of his other novels. It was a disappointing book which will end up in my next garage sale."
2,Not that funny.,"I usually enjoy good ethnic humor, some of which is laugh-out-loud funny, but this one merits only a small and occasional smile. Perhaps it was better in the original German."
4,Hazel Dickens rules,"This, as are all 3 of her solo albums, is great. The title track gives me chills. She was one of the few authentic female hillbilly singers, with that flat (as in non-vibrato), piercing, yodel-influenced voice. She will be missed!"
4,The Pure Voice of Hazel Dickens,"Loved this album for years. Had to get the CD. The pure voice of Hazel Dickens is a wonderment. The true American heart without makeup, and silly background dancers and gossip.There's a lot more people who feel like Hazel Dickens than any Pop star on ET or People Mag. I've known them. Gimme Hazel. The rest are fluff that just dish out indigestion.Scars of an Old Love? My Mama's Hands? Go 'Way With Me? Pure American Masterpieces from the heart."
1,Had to stop watching this movie due to boredom...,"I ordered this movie based on the excellent reviews from the previous three viewers, so I had high hopes for it when I put it in my DVD player. Unfortunately, as soon as the movie started, it became quite evident that it was very low budget. The acting was poor, there was no increase in tension at all, and the pointless conversation scenes were extremely long. I watched this movie for about one hour, before deciding to stop it. Mind you, I am very tolerant, and I try to find goodness in the majority of the movies I watch, but this one was intolerable."
4,Motivational,I found this DVD on a Spinning class to be very Motivational and like me if you are starting out would be a good DVD to start with.Would recommend this to all doing such training...One thing though it only has the one traing class would be better if there were 2 classes on a DVD.....
2,Good news! Bad news!,"If you're looking for a 90 min. compilation of 5 or 6 HOT guys in ""solo action"", full-frontal, up close and personal, this is the DVD for you. If you're looking for something with a story line, forget it! There's only the barest (hee, hee, hee) of story lines here. Just a silly thread to tie together the solo strip sequences. WHY can't the people who make these films combine BOTH features, i.e. a plausible story line AND full frontal."
1,not worth 1 star,"I'm a big fan of (...) movies, but this one is simply trash. No storyline, bad acting, you gotta be a masochist to watch this film. It's the worst I've seen in a long time. If you want to suffer through this film, rent it, do not waste your money buying it."
2,Not worth it unless you want to use it once,"This was great the first time I used it, but that's it. It stretched out so much it just fell off the massager, and it's very difficult to clean."
3,Not as good as the first,"This one was physically quite a bit smaller, had very few pictures and the awards given out were not quite as entertaining.First one:The Ig Nobel Prizes"
2,"OK, but not so great","I was disappointed with this book; it started well, but it petered out at about half through. It was good to learn that voters generally choose to vote for politicians based upon ""just two things - how energetic is he or she, and how trustworthy"". I could have happily gone my entire life without knowing about researchers who sniffed feet to research foot odor. (Yet, I read that entire chapter. What does that say about me?)I bought a new, hardcover edition of this book in Dollar Tree, so I can't complain about the price. If you see it for sale somewhere for a dollar or less, buy it. It makes a good book to read a chapter per night just before lights out."
2,Hope they work out the bugs in the next version,"On the plus side, the program is easy to use; kids will love it. On the negative side, I have compatibility problems. It worked on my first webcam, but not my new one. There is a Visual Communicator software update, but it did not fix my problem. The best technical support could do was suggest I update my video card driver, which had no effect. I never could get it to work on a laptop, it continually crashes. I did install it on another computer, which works better, but the video is still out of synch with the audio."
3,Ok but not quite what I expected,It seemed to be a bit wrinkled on the pages as if it had gotten wet at some point. So somewhat dissapointed.
3,"NIV Study Bible, Personal Size","Copy in excellent condition. Comments extremely useful for devotional study of the Bible as it draws out spiritual meaning and application. For school teachers of Divinity, the historical and cultural background information very relevant,useful and helpful to both teacher and student. Its possession is a Must!"
4,Praxis I: PPST pre-professional skills tests prep guide,"I loved this book. I feel like it prepared me very well for the test (although I haven't taken it yet). I especially liked the mathematics review, it was very easy to understand and reviewed many key concepts I had long forgotten. The only part I did not like was that the CBT was excluded and the book didn't give you an idea of how the scores are ranked (compared to peers), meaning what score is excellent, good, average ... etc."
3,Half of A Book,"I would not have bought this book in a store, and I should have looked at the dimensions of the book more carefully. It is half the size of the larger Praxis books and it is no bargin. ... The review is very short and some of the test information is out of date and it does not have practice CBT tests. This book will not hurt you but I don't think it is worth the money and you should look at the other books"
3,Informative but dry,"I learned new information to me about the early Native Americans. The professor clearly knows much about the subject. His writing style is dry and impersonal. His attempts to link whatever happened to the pueblo dwellers to our present-day issues are a logical and literary stretch and generally detracted from writing about the Native Americans. I am about half way through ""In Search of the Old Ones"", but I believe it is much better."
1,Feather bed needs covering,"The feather bed was comfortable until after a few days went by and I felt like something was sticking me through the cover. The ends of the feathers from the filling kept poking through the covering causing a ""prickly"" feeling which I found to be quite annoying. I guess you are supposed to put a cover over the feather bed, butI did not know that when I purchased it. I tried putting another sheetover the top of it but it kept sliding around and coming off."
1,Featherbed is multing,"This feather bed is quite comfortable BUT the feathers keep coming through the outside covering and the ends of the feathers feel very prickly when many of them come right through it. I have to put my top sheet over the feather bed as well as the fitted sheet. Since I just bought this item,I didn't think that would happen so fast. I guess I need a cover over it to stop this from happening."
3,Usable but only in specialized situations,"I wasn't expecting too much from this product given the price, but I found that it has been serviceable so far. I've used it for some animal photography and hand-held it is usable in full sunlight. However when attempting to use if for lunar photography, I found that it was too difficult to focus accurately even with a sturdy tripod due to camera movement when focusing. Also chromatic aberration can be somewhat corrected, but negatively affects overall image quality at high focus lengths. Finally, when using the included doubling teleconverter, the minimum aperture drops to f/16 at full zoom."
2,Not quite like they advertised it,"""Perception of quality is immediate,"" boasts the last line of their advertisement. The poor color of the wood, the poor packaging, and most of all, the rust on the hinges and latches, immediately led me to perceive a gross lack of quality. They did, however, refund my money, with the shipping I paid to get it to me, though I'm still out the seven dollars I spent to return it to them. It just wasn't worth all the hastle that it came with. Be careful before you buy this item."
4,Good but not Great,"Fours Stars because it is the Sun Story but... I have the vinyl and there are 8 songs that were left off the CD. They left off My Bucket's Got A Hole In It and High School Confidential, which are the two most egregious errors. A guy at Rhino Records told me they didn't get the clearances for the CD. Didn't make sense. Why didn't they get them for all formats? However this is a good start. If you can find the vinyl get it."
5,This CD's RED HOT!,"This is the good stuff that put the rock in rockabilly! Hard driving, hard pumping gritty poor-White Rhythm and Blues that is still a lot of fun to listen to nearly 50 years later. All the classics are here. Elvis, Bill, and Scotty doing ""That's All Right Mama"" (with apologies to Arthur Crudup), Warren Smith's ""Ubangi Stomp,"" Charlie Rich's lovely ""Lonely Weekends."" Carl Perkins' ""Honey Don't,"" and (to me), best of all, Billy Riley's underground classic ""My gal is Red Hot/Your gal ain't doodely squat!"" So is this CD! FUN FUN FUN! I DEFY anyone to sit still while listening to this!"
4,The Prayer Book Reason Why,"This book could well serve as a Catechism for the Episcopal Church; it is presented in the typical question and answer format. The facts are mostly correct for the date in which it was written, some of these items have changed. While it was recommended as source for the Anglican Church, there are some vivid differences (there are differences among Anglicans). One item of note, the book refers to the two Sacraments, in the APA (Anglican Provence of American), there are seven.The questions are clear, the responses are mostly appropriate for the most parts. It is worth reading but one should know their or realize the differences in own Catechism.It would be nice if someone rewote this book in accordance to the present churches."
5,Perfect for my spare bathroom .,"This is exactly what I needed for my spare bathroom, since the shower has no shelves in it. It is large enough to hold all my toiletries, and I especially like the hook for body scrubbers."
4,Its Ok.,"Its just ok. I have two of them. How are they better than others I do not know. If you want something like this, get this one. Its Ok."
1,DO NOT SUPPORT THIS GUY,"Seriously, he's a terrible writer, and as far as this magazine goes, he DOESN'T PAY HIS CONTRIBUTERS, and on more than one occasion, he has printed work by other authors AFTER THEY TOLD HIM THEY DIDN'T WANT HIS PUBLICATION TO PRINT THEIR WORK. He's also threatened several other writers with violence, and sometimes with sexual abuses. However, this man DOES write like H.P. Lovecraft - if Lovecraft were a four year old with Down Syndrome who suddenly forgot how to put together a coherent story.P.S. I tried to not give this crap any stars, but Amazon wouldn't let me. My review doesn't give him any real stars, I only picked the one so that it would let me post this. Keep that in mind, and once again: AVOID THIS GARBAGE AT ALL COSTS!"
1,Piece of garbage,"Low budget, far fetched, left wing propaganda movie, belongs in the class of Michael Moore, but far less convincing and amateurish directing and story line. Don't waste your money on this garbage."
1,Started Well But...,"This movie had a lot of promise and started well. The main character was well done and believable. The plot was thrilling and smart--not the typical Hollywood car-chase, shoot-em-up adrenaline rush. Having said all that, they ruined everything good about this movie with an unbelievable 9/11 conspiracy theory twist near the end. Not only is the plot twist stupid, it's been done over and over again--the US government and the CIA are behind everything wrong in the world, blah, blah, blah. In this movie, the government conspires to prop up drug dealing and terrorism--wow, that's brilliant. I've got news for you, drug dealing and terrorism are thriving on their own without government help. Most of all I'm just angry at another potentially good movie wasted with a staggeringly foolish storyline. Skip it and save your time."
3,You just have to hear it to believe it,"I thought I heard the most unique style cover album when I heard the Nutley Brass cover The Misfits (here), but that's all changed with this one. Thornton covers the legendary punk pioneers entirely on steel drums. You're probably scratching your head thinking, ""How could that be any good?"" You just have to hear it to believe it."
5,Best product ever,I used Indian Earth in the 70's and 80's and then couldn't find it so started using some of the other products out. NONE could match it and when I found it on line I was very pleased. It works on all shades of skin.
2,I don't like it!,"I have used California Sun Glow by Steiner for years. When I received the Original Indian earth makeup powder I thoughtit was going the be a similar product. It is so red and I am having a very hard time applying it without looking like I have been out in the sun too long, plus I have it all over everything. I should return it."
2,Perhaps worthwhile for occasional use,"This item works fine initially. In short order the tool clogs (authoritatively!) If you desolder once or twice a month this tool might work for you. However I have gone back to a cold sucker and my iron (with a little braid to get the little bits).Construction is shabby and the clogs are very hard to clear. The gaskets weaken and the catch that holds the plunger against the spring tension is very weak and in time the tool will fail to hold it's ""ready"" position.Not a good purchase. Stick with what you've got!"
4,"""The Traveler"" -- a Satisfying Combo of Plot and Horror","The tales in CRAZED KILLERS run the gamut from very cheesy drive-in-movie fillers, to thought-provoking, interesting films. Of the six in the set, three stand above the rest: ""Toe Tags"" for its interesting plot; ""Serial Killer"" for both its story line and its almost full-porn, which would appeal to some viewers; and ""The Traveler"" (the BEST of the lot) for its complete package of scenery, special effects, and finely crafted story line. Of all six films, this one comes closest to being a real movie -- despite its occasional flaws. While its opening scenes are slower-paced than those in the other five films, the positive side is that the viewer comes to know the characters well enough that the horror becomes all the more terrifying once it begins."
4,Crazed Killers... Great Non Hollywood Horror,"The Crazed Killers DVD offers creative horror movies. An out of the box way of thinking regarding the stories. It is great to see new faces and new ideas on my TV at home. You can't beat the price, one heck of a deal for 6 movies."
1,Horrible,"So bad we return this movie. My husband and I like ""B horrors""but this one was just bad. It was boring and looks like an 8 year old filmed it. Would not recommend even to ""B-horror"" lovers!"
2,If you camp next to a grocery store - this book's for you!,"The book COOKING ON A STICK is an intriguing title and may hint at being a simple book - but it's not. The recipes call for a can of non-stick cooking spray along with perishable foods such as hotdogs, fruit, eggs, etc. The recipe ideas are only suitable if one is camping next to a grocery store! There is even a recipe which suggests you let your child make a necklace out of dried fruit and cereal and that the child wear it around their neck for snack food. If you're trying to attract a bear this might be a great idea.I would not recommend this book for anything but the backyard camper. It is also not written at a level that your kids can read the recipes themselves, although the pictures suggest it is a children's book."
2,Not what I had hoped for,"The ideas aren't particularly simple but can be done with a bit of forward planning. However, there aren't a great deal of new ideas in the book and if you are not from the US you will need to Google a lot of the terms (shoestring potatoes, catsup, etc). I was hoping for lots of ideas of quick and easy grub for cooking on a stick and bizarrely this book doesn't really provide that."
1,not so much,I had higher expectations for this book than what it turned out to be. I didn't find anything new and exciting here.
2,not what I was looking for,"I wanted a book with new recipes for actually cooking on a stick, which this book's title claims...but there are only 6 recipes that use a stick, one of which is the s'mores recipe and what camper doesn't already know that one? Another recipe is for kabobs that have meat, veggies, and salad dressing over top which is equally as self-explanatory. Three of the six recipes require a biscuit mix that they offer the recipe for, which involves bowls, measuring cups/spoons, mixing spoons, etc. This biscuit recipe also calls for powdered milk, and my son is dairy-free and I don't know of any replacement for powdered milk, so I did not find it very versatile. There are 14 recipes for cooking in a pouch and/or on a grill, and four recipes for ""trail food."" These could be fun, but I was hoping to say ""hey kids, throw this food on a stick and have fun cooking it over the fire!"" They should rename the book."
3,only the blade,This is only the blades not the arm and the blade like in the picture. They seam to work fine nothing special.
5,Brilliant!!!,"Hello Katie, We just loved hearing you last night, with Mark Coles on the BBC program ""The Ticket""--- Wow!!! So, when are you coming to the USA?!! Best wishes for continued success. Cheers, Jeffrey Bell-Zekas, Susanville, California."
3,Sizes run big.,"The construction of these gloves are okay, but the sizes run extremely large. I got a size small, but these are a really a medium to large. Just be aware when ordering!"
1,It stinks,"Self indulgent, yawn worthy pap. I find it difficult to conceive that this is a celebrated author. No idea what he was trying to achieve here. My only recommendation is to avoid it."
1,"My gosh, what a sad waste","Someone used the word snippet to describe what is included in this production; it is a good term. So, snippet it is; but what has been included gives no introduction, no explanation, no explication, no nothing. The tape is of different bits of Shakespeare's plays which run rapidly into each other. To get any fair use out of this work the listener needs to sit with a printed copy of the complete works sitting on his or her lap otherwise the whole exercise is meaningless. Shakespeare requires understanding what is being said in context. This tape would be better served if it included a brief introduction regarding which play the snippet came from and how the dialog ties in with the action. Without this information only those who have read all the plays will not be lost. There are not many who can claim that background. So, as a stand-alone audio, for most of us, this tape is a sad waste."
5,Great and accurate Book,"This is a very descriptive book on the 1964 Tsunami that hit Crescent City, California , I was there and know what happened and this is the best account I have read about the subject. The Town of Crescent City is glad Mr Powers took the time and effort to research this terrible thing that destroyed our town over 40 years ago. Thanks Mr Powers !Sandy Nuss, Crescent City ,California"
1,Poorly written,"The writing style is repetitive, disorganized, and poorly edited (if there was an editor). E.g. on page 149: ""The ocean suddenly rose quickly up again."" and ""The towering flames were easily seen and highly visible..."", page 143: ""...burning bulk tanks were a constant danger to spreading the contagion"", and on page 155: ""He threw out his sea anchor, but the swift currents kept it from catching bottom"" (sea anchors are not supposed to catch bottom).Although the subject is interesting, the sloppy writing makes this book very difficult to read."
1,NPT not as pictured,"Pictured is a 3/4"" slip fit floor flange. Description didn't specify threaded or not, so I had to go by the picture.Picture is wrong.I received a threaded (3/4"" NPT) floor flange that looks nothing like the picture. Worth paying return shipping? Maybe, maybe not.See how high up the flange comes in the picture (about an inch off the floor)? You'll receive one that is threaded and only comes up about a half way as the picture.Besides the deceiving picture, the build quality is low. The floor flange was cast in such a way that it looks like it was done by hand in a sand mold (not in a good way). One edge of the circular bottom is partially flat (metal didn't make it to the perimeter of the mold).This is a brass piece. Brass is often used to be decorative. This isn't."
1,Greatly disappointed,"The item is fine, but not the size ordered, and supplier refused to send correct item, as they had no control over their inventory. I ordered 3/4""Brass Floor Flange, 3/4"", but they sent 1"" (labeled as 3/4"") , which they claim they do not have. They did offer a refund, but the cost of return shipping made that unreasonable. With some effort, one can find a different supplier on the internet."
4,This stuff works!!!,This is a fantastic product! I've tried different products out on the market and this is the first product that actually delivered.
5,Expensive but worth it,"I bought this product to try to help rid myself of the dreaded ingrown hairs. I apply this stuff on my shaved areas for a day or 2 after each shaving, and I haven't gotten an ingrown hair at all. I know this product is expensive, but the fact that I haven't had an ingrown hair since I began using it makes it all worth it. I hate ingrown hairs. They hurt."
2,Not for sensitive skin.,"First and foremost, this product is not for everyone. It definitely is not for me. Having a rough beard and sensitive skin is...well not so great. Throw in having ingrown hair issues...practically a disaster. That being said, this product does have alcohol in it so it burns like a mother when put on post shave. I figured to get rid of ingrown hairs I'd have to deal with the initial pain as long as everyone dealt with my screaming when I put it on. Unfortunately, that wasn't the only issue that I have with the product. I probably didn't use it long enough to see any real results, but what it did do was give me acne(tiny whiteheads) whenever I used it. So I discontinued use, and those little buggers went away. Unfortunately, I'm still stuck with those pesky ingrowns. I'll have to go back to using my other treatment solution. The major reason I gave this a shot was more product for the money. I guess quality over quantity wins this battle."
1,Does not work for me,"The overall effect is almost absent. It did not make things worse, and there might even be an improvement. Yet, if there is, it is so small that I cannot really see it after a month of use. I will have to go for some other product."
5,Does the trick!,"Softens ingrown hairs, makes them easy to remove, as well as reducing those annoying ""bumps"" that you can get on your neck. A little goes a long way with this product. Also, I use it in conjunction with Anthony Logistics Shave Gel for a perfect ""bump-free"" shave. Great product, worth the price 'cause it works!"
1,didn't work,"I have been using this product for almost a month and still, didn't notice any changes. I still get ingrown hair going. I really wish I could find a product that solve this issue, because even what the different doctors gave me didn't work! hate it!"
5,Best Hair Bump Treatment,"I have been troubled with razor bumps or almost 20 years. After trying many different products combined with different shaving techniques, a friend of mine introduced Anthony Logistics to me. Skeptical, I saw his face was clearer than mine, so I figured it couldn't hurt. Amazed after a month of daily applications I noticed some of my problem areas were becoming more clear. The best part of all, a little goes along way. I recommend this product to anyone who suffers from ingrown hairs."
4,"Great, if exspensive ingrown hair treatment for men.","I have sensitive oily skin that would love me to never shave again. However, I'm not quite ready for the 19th century mountain man look, so I have to use sensitive skin shaving and skin products, as well as change my razor blades often. Even then I get ingrown hairs every week or so. I use Anthony logistics Ingrown Hair Treatment twice a day, even when I don't have any ingrown hairs. It helps to prevent and treat the few that I get. I won't say it will completely prevent users from getting ingrown hairs, but it will make them less frequent and serious. The package is a pump dispenser, which is a little sensitive at first, so I have to be careful not to dispense too much. Right now, a can lasts a month and a half or so."
5,JIM CARRY!,This is my favoirte jim carry movie. And im a hudge fan. It verry funny and mutch better than the fist one.
4,Another,"If you liked the first ACE, you'll love him even more in this continuence of that lovable pet detective."
4,One of Jim Carrey's best,This Movie Is Filled With Laughs In One Of Jim Carrey's Zaniest Proformences yet.Anytime Im Down In The dumps I Watch Ace Ventura To Cheer Me Up Jim Carrey Makes Me Laugh More than Any comedian In The World.Jim Carrey Is A Relief To The Comedy World Watch This And get His Magic Spell Put on You Today Trust Me Youll Never Look At Movies The same.
3,The Sequel,"Yes, it is a sequel, and it isn't as good as the first. It doesn't make as much sense as the first one, BUT it's still almost as hilarious. Jim Carrey might even be crazier in this one! The features in the DVD are alright, and the movie is good to own if you want to complete your collection, and of course, you like Jim Carrey and/or just want to have a good time."
5,Very good!!!!!,"Most comedys that i watch are trying to be funny and do not make me laugh, this one did!This film may be old but its still good, i have heard people say that ace ventura when nature calls is a kids movie, but its not, it is suitable for everyone, this movie has almost everything (apart from gore and sex!) it has comedy, action, violence.The best part is when ace leaves the temple and there is a guy running around in his underwear!It is a good film, but it is a shame that there is no special features(apart from subtitles but that doesn't count) and that it is in such a cheap box, but atleast the film is on dvd!"
3,Funny and Hilarious Movie,"Jim Carrey, is very, very, funny in this movie you'll laugh at him the whole time. I enjoyed this movie and I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a Jim Carrey fan. I really liked the beginning of the movie and even the ending."
4,Classic Carrey!,"Ace Ventura was certainly a film that deserved a sequel. Ace Ventura 2 provides pleanty of opportunity for Jim to dispay his unique skill for causing chaos where ever he goes on his trip to Africa. If you liked the first Ace Ventura film you're bound to love this sequel. I'm impressed with Jim's performance but as a film, the story line hasn't been driven to heights of genius."
1,i wouldnt wish this on anyone,"not funny,dumb plot,jim is not funny in this film,this is prolly the worst jim c. movie ever made"
1,Don't even think about seeing this movie!,"This is one of the worstest movies I have ever seen. The first one was the best, I just didn't like this one it was boring. There are some funny scenes in this sequel but when I saw this one in theaters I almost fell asleep, I thought it was a slow movie."
4,Jim Carrey is a comic genius,"No matter what the critics might say, this is a great movie for great laughs. Jim Carrey's comedic acts are such that even though you've never seen them before they look familiar. The movie has you laughing all the way through from the Cliffhanger scene to when Ace travels back to the monastery in his spirit. Carrey shows that sometimes comedy does conquer all."
2,Nah! The first one was MUCH better!,"This sequel was terrible. When Nature Calls Was not funny at all.. well only some parts, but not enough to satisfy. Buy Ace Ventura Pet Detective, not this one."
3,JUNGLE JIM,"Jim Carrey has got to be one of the most hyperkinetic, manic performers in movies. While this works most of the time for him, in this second Ace Ventura vehicle, it serves more as an irritant. There are some funny sequences in the movie, but they don't come as fast and furious as in the first. And Carrey's long pauses before finishing a punch line are so redundant in this one, it does become annoying. The supporting cast also isn't that impressive. As one reviewer said, this is merely a movie to showcase the bizarre antics of its star. Little Spike the monkey is fun as in the first flick, and its hard to believe we have an Oscar nominated actress (Sophie Okenedo - Hotel Rwanda) as the jungle princess. But this is Carrey's movie, and it's not one of his finer moments. But you will laugh occasionally."
3,"LOW ON PLOT, HIGH ON JIM CARREY SHOWCASE","Ace Ventura Pet Detective was not only laugh-out-loud funny, it also had a real plot for a film. This sequel sadly is simply a Jim Carrey showcase. Yes, there's a lot of wild-n-whacky -- ""going down the temple steps"", ""rhino vehicle"", ""monkey and waterfall"" etc had me heaving with laughter. But apart from a few scattered gags and funnies, there really is little here to grip you and have you laughing. Watch it in a relaxed, undemanding mood with a couple of friends...chat and laugh your way through it."
4,Classic Jim Carrey,"Anyone who loves Jim Carrey must own Ace Ventura, Pet Detective. It also stars Courtney Cox, and Dan Marino. There are many parodies of other movies as well, such as the Crying Game."
3,The fault is with the screenplay and the direction....,"Jim Carrey has proved himself a great talent, but in this case, he's stifled. Ace Ventura was honestly an enjoyable character in the first movie. But this time, he gets tiresome fast.One difficulty is that there's no reverence for animals here. The opening scene, and yes I realize it was meant to be satirical of Sylvester Stallone's CLIFFHANGER, was singularly unfunny to me, and the movie sorta kept on going downhill from there.There is appeal to those who enjoy inane grossouts. I will say that. However, I suspect this will disappoint two thirds of the ones who liked the first Ace Ventura and of course will be of absolutely no interest to those who didn't like the first one."
2,Dismal follow-up to a great Carrey film,"I'll give this sequel 2 stars, representing the two main elements it's missing: goofy humor and on-screen chemistry between Jim Carrey and his co-stars. Viewers of the first film easily remember Courtney Cox, Sean Young and Tone Loc as witnesses/victims of Carrey's outrageous humor. The sequel, however, is a one-man vehicle that devotes almost every second to Carrey. If Carrey was acting his heart out, it MAY have turned out better. Unfortunately, it seems as if Carrey is delivering lifelessly, in the hopes of moving on fast.No co-stars, bad laughs and no storyline... save yourself the trouble, skip this flick and stick with the original Ace Ventura, as Jim Carrey should have."
1,not worth your time,"This movie is the sequel to a hilarious movie, but it didn't live up to my expectations. It wasn't funny, it was crude."
3,"Not as good as the first, but still worth the watch","I loved everything about this movie & Jim Carrey is hillarious as always. If you liked the first one, it's not as good, but you will still love it and this movie will make you laugh for sure. This movie had some gut busting sceenes and a funny story line and all in all if you like to laugh, this movie will be worth it for you to watch."
1,I really want 90 minutes of my life back,"I am a Jim Carry fan, and have laughed and loved many of his movies, particularly Mask. But this movie was simply terrible. For about 89 of the 90 minutes I sat in boredom, hoping that the movie would suddenly get better, then losing hope very quickly. The twists in the plot-line were about as interesting as the curves in my garden hose. The plot-line was also very very shallow, and did not engage or ensnare me at all. Please take my advice, and do not watch this crass, immature, and pointless movie."
3,movie rental review,The movie itself is great Jim Carrey is good injust about all he does. It would be very blurrey at timesthen clear. There was too many blurring times.
2,wouldnt play well on my netbook,It kept halting and buffering. I didn't get past the first 5 minutes. So I wont be buying movies from my netbook anymore.
2,C'mon!Why did you ruin it?!,"If you really loved the first movie,this will be a disappointment.It looked as if Jim Carrey was desperately trying to melt in the Ace character.Some times he succedes,most of the times he doesn't.I thought the first Ace was one of the funniest movies ever.It was quite frustrating that the sequel wasn't as great.I think the main reason is because the brilliant Tom Shadyac wasn't the director here.Every comedy he directs works(just look at the Nutty Proffessor,Liar Liar and the first Ace Ventura)."
2,Carrey is a mixture of human cartoon and self-parody.,"He makes more funny noises! He says ""Alrighty then!"" in a comical way! He has an unconventional hairdo! If you've outgrown The Three Stooges you've outgrown Ace Ventura. I saw the original Ace Ventura movie when I was 19. I saw the sequel when I was 24. Guess which one I thought was funnier."
3,Good for a sequel.,"Essentaily the same as the first Ace Ventura only instead of clever plot gags, this film tends to resort to gross-outs. Still funny, though."
1,Merchandise not recieved!,dvdlegacy is not supposed to be in amazon seller they ripped you off big time...I never got or recieved my order on 2/28/2009. I send them email but they never answer your email to them.
5,Fortells the arrival of the real DECLARATION of independence!,"This book is filled with so much information, sometimes one has to stop, digest what was just read and then go on. I could feel the author's desire to get out a message of vast importance, yet knowing that so many would ignore it or even laugh. Well, I'm not laughing. There are many signs (if one will just look) that tell of the truths behind Sheldon's words. His life long association with the Sirians, his childhood traumas because he was different both shows him to be a man of determination. I really admire and applaud Sheldon Nidle for doing what he can to present a lifeline of hope in spite of the threat of the ""last dark cabal."" This information is so different from that which has been 'channeled.' This is more like the incessant ringing of the bells of freedom which foretell the arrival of the real DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE!"
5,Your First Contact,"Sheldan does a wonderful job explaining how Earth fits into our galaxy's history. His extensive education in science and history gives this book credibility. His interpretation of where we came from, why we're here and where we are going is mind/heart expanding. I couldn't put this book down! I am inspired, once again, about life on our planet - that there is a divine plan and our role in creating a new paradigm. There was also fascinating information explaining the ascension process happening with our physical bodies. Our return to what Sheldan calls ""Full Consciousness"" is a journey worth experiencing. Thank you, Sheldan, for connecting all the dots by explaining the meaning/purpose of our physical realm in relation to the spiritual realms."
4,No Merchant-Ivory writing here...,"at least not in the usual sense. The Merchant-Ivory team, which made movies like Remains Of The Day, used to make movies about India. Jhabvala, of course, has written all of the team's movies, and a fair helping of fiction as well. This dates back to the early days of Merchant-Ivory (1973).Two of the titular travelers are westerners who have come to India, one for apparently no reason other than to relax, and one to experience enlightment. They are offset by two Indians. The paths of all four quickly intertwine.This is a book about two things. On the one hand, it's a meticulous character study. On the other hand, it's all about westerners interfering with other cultures. It's a time capsule look at what the Beatles wrought in the wake of their visit to India. It's engrossing, well-written (simple and straighforward, no flowery metaphors), and, to a certain extent, it's history."
1,Old Stuff,"While I'm as much of a Gordie Howe fan as the next guy, these videos (it's a series) are NOT for anyone who isn't ready to listen to Gordie talk. There's little action, so your Mite or Squirt will be uninterested, and, let's face it, Gordie Howe might as well be Ernie Shore or Dinah Shore to anyone under 18. If it was presented better, it might be ok, but it has the production values of a bad driver's ed movie."
1,30 minutes of little kids skating around,"The production value of this video was horrendous. It looked as ifit was recorded on used video tapes. Gordie and his sons glowed an eerie red throughout the video. There were some good tips that took advantage of Mr. Howe's extensive hockey career. However, I got the feeling that the video was full of fluff footage of little kids skating around which did very little in teaching viewers how to power skate. Easily 2/3 of the video was wasted footage and I couldn't help but feel ripped off."
3,A good script goes a long way,"a cracking adventure, made on shoestring budget but delivers entertainment. Just sit back and enjoy the ride. Some of the acting is dodgy but cripes people in real life aren't always convincing. The music could have been much better but the characters are likeable and good to each other. I want to see films with this sort of kindness in the characters. I am fed up with swearing, aggressive, 'blow everyone except myself' blockbusters which are the norm now. This is not a 'blow your mind' film but a good solid enjoyment."
1,So bad I had to watch it.,"This film is an attempt to do for the Crocodile what Jaws did for the Great White Shark, except whereas Jaws was a masterful marriage of story line and taught suspense, this is utterly laughable with a cliched and totally preposterous script and some of the worst ""special effects"" I've seen in a long time. Ironically , its awfulness is its redeeming feature...I found myself compelled to watch it because it was so bad."
2,"What's below ""B"" Movie?","I like bad movies, they're good to watch and make fun of with friends. This movie has plenty to make fun of. For example, for those of you with the movie, go 31 minutes into the movie. There's a guy in a white t-shirt wiggling his tongue between his two fingers in the background. Why is he doing that? Could he be the worst movie extra since Teen Wolf?Most of the crocodile footage (that isn't actually alligators) comes from 70s style footage. I'd expect nothing less. Not scary, just bad."
3,Proves Ayreon's music is more than the sum of its parts,"Arjen thought his audience was two different groups: Prog rock fans and metal fans. For The Universal Migrator, he made a prog rock album (part 1) and a metal album (part 2). They both come out pretty lackluster for it. I love his other Ayreon works because they combine great aspects of prog and metal together in a way that doesn't bore the ear the way a lot of prog rock does, and doesn't fatigue it the way a lot of metal does.There are a couple good songs on this album but on the whole I rate it as the weakest of the Ayreon project."
3,"Okay, but maybe not that ""cuddley""","It is nice that the cover comes off so you can throw it in the wash. This size does seem a little large for my cats (1 is 8.5 lbs the other is 12 lbs.) I think they prefer places that have a little more hiding involves and places to cuddle up a little tighter. It was worth the price, though."
5,Tiger Loves it,Tiger loves the Red one and his Brothers Smokey loves the blue one. Eac claims his own color.
1,something's amiss,"I bought this bed as a Christmas present. The cats gave it a look, smelled it, and haven't been near it since. Because they ordinarily love new beds, I'm guessing there's ""something amiss"" in this product."
2,Is a 4154a picture; you call it a 4153a,"Is a 4154a picture; you call it a 4153aWhich is it? One drum has a 3"" roller. The other an 8"" roller."
4,Installation is Easy,"The drum kit, new filters and toner waste tray all take about five minutes to install thanks to the clear graphical instructions supplied by HP. It is much less trouble than you think. Expensive, but the output quality is worth it."
2,BORING,"This book was cute to look at, but completely useless. Seriously, who would do half of these silly ideas the author spouted? Dressing in your finest for dinner at home? Wearing a fancy silk robe? Using velvet curtains in the doorway, instead of on the window? Come on. By the tenth idea, I was bored to tears and regretting buying this book. Goodwill, here it comes!"
1,Fluff,I thought the book was silly. I guess I have read all this before and found nothing new. Maybe young girls will appreciate it. The cover with the fabric insert was cute.I'm giving my copy away.
1,"Silly, silly book","The best thing you could do for yourself is don't subject yourself to reading this adolescent book. If buying just a small thing from Tiffany's and using the shopping bag as a planter gives you a thrill, then this is for you. Not me! Sorry."
1,"Oh boy, this is a bad one.","I love books that give tips on how to make life more fun and enjoyable. I've been wanting to purchase this book for a while, but could never pull the trigger. Luckily, I found it for a $1 at a book sale. Even at that price, I'm not sure I got my money's worth. The best tip is in the title, then it all goes downhill from there. The author was apparently trying to mimic Diana Vreeland's style in the Why Don't You columns, but pulling off a Diana Vreeland is no easy feat. The author's ideas came off as frivolous, flip, and silly rather than imaginative and daring. Don't waste your hard earned cash on this one!"
1,Not For Laptops,"I wish I could say that I was not typing this review, but rather dictating it. I have no clue how this product really performs, because I just found out from L&H technical support that the mic they provide does not work with laptops PC's. I am told that I need to purchase a USB mic that will cost an other $50.00, which they do not mention in their documentation. I am sure that this will hold true on all Voice Recognition products and not just L&H, but they should have been upfront with as customers. So, If you are thinking of purchasing this product make sure you purchase a USB mic that will not get interference from you laptop. I will write a follow up if I decide to get the other mic."
1,NEVER RECEIVED IT,"I would love to review it but I never received this product, therefore I will never purchase from AMAZON again!!!!"
2,Pre Thunder Chord and not jammin,"Ok, so to meThunder ChordandHouse Made of Dawnare the best Coyote Oldman CDs. This one, Landscape, appears to be pre Thunder Chord. However it is a side-journey compared to CO's best works. In this CD is seems they are experimenting with alot of minor chords or multiple flutes that are holding a-harmonic (non-harmonic) notes to one another. While I can appreciate this type of creative 'tension', especially at times when used with twin flutes, it just does not seem like they are able to pull it off in this CD."
1,JUNK Avoid like the plague,"I bought this because I couldn't get the Trendnet 204 working with an IPSEC VPN, and thought this might solve the problem. WRONG!!! Opened the box, tried to configure it, but it wouldn't store any data. When I changed the password, it wouldn't take it. tried to add PPTP VPN clients... wouldn't take it. It's total junk. Within an hour it was packed up and on it's way back.Still looking for a decent IPSEC VPN router to use on Comcast, but I'm pretty sure that TRENDNET doesn't make one"
2,Antonline - poor return policy,"Beware buying this product from Antonline, they have a poor return policy:Unfortunately, products with customer caused item, packaging or accessory damage; OR that are missing items, accessories or packaging; OR with activated software or intellectual property agreements; OR with missing packaging or accessories; OR that cannot be resold as new - exactly as you received the product are not eligible for return or refund."
3,S'ok,"While Azrael pointed out that a lot of vanity presses crank out books for anyone, just because a ""small press"" prints a book doesn't mean it is a vanity press. There are many good books which are not picked up by larger, mainstream presses because they just can't publish every good author.Having said this, I have to agree with some of the others. Urban legend and proofreader come to mind with this book. If you haven't read anything else about Indiana and you can overlook so many errors, especially some factual ones, then you would like this book."
3,Could be better,"If you are interested in urban legend type stories then this is a good reference book for you. Most stories I read in this book I have heard before. Be prepared for the bad grammer though, and misspelled words. It does not give a good description of the locations of these places which would have been helpfull. Worth a read though if you are interested in ghost stories."
2,I Read This First-BIG MISTAKE,"I was excited to read books by Richard Laymon, especially when I read many reviews about him and I also went into his website. I started with this book, his second, as opposed to The Cellar. This was one of the worst books I have ever read. There was no buildup of the story, just jump right and start the slaughter. I like the story to start and we learn about the characters. I thought I was going to give up on Laymon, but now I'm reading The Cellar and it's much better. I'm hoping the books get better as they go on."
5,THE WOODS ARE DARK,"This book is excellent it was the first book of Laymons I read and after reading another 5 they still havent been up to the standards as this one. it keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way through the book right from page one, its the best horror/suspense story i have ever read whith a great plot. i would definatly recommend it to everyone who likes horror."
3,Only a so-so Laymon book,"Since the only other review posted here is a 5-star rave review, which is what made me buy this book in the first place, I feel it necessary to give my (different) opinion on this book.The book is pretty short, it doesn't take long to read it. I felt that there should have been more focus on the plot instead of the gore. I recommend reading Laymon's ""Midnight's Lair"" if you want something really good by this author. Even the title ""The Woods Are Dark"" is pretty lame. This book isn't lousy, but it isn't spectacular either. I'm about to read some more Laymon books, and I'm hoping they will be better than this one was."
1,YUCKY.,"It was definitely a page turner, but it left me feeling yucky. I don't usually mind gore-y nasty books, but this one screwed with my mind."
5,Laymon does it again!,"This book is nothing but gory, disgusting filth with gross morbid sexual acts...and I loved every minute of it. Laymon is one of a kind and I love all his books! This is a must read, ESPECIALLY if you like ""Beast House""! 5 stars!"
5,Amazing!,"Everyone should read this book! I bought it on Audible too. I recommend an audio version, it's a lot of intense information and hearing it makes it easier to get through. But i feel this book is very informative and kind with the information presented. I really feel that even if you aren't a Vegan or prepared to be this is a wonderful book to at least open your eyes to how we as humans have got ourselves into a scary situation and can choose to change if only we all really knew what was going on and the consequences it has on everyone and everything."
5,Thoughts on Dr. Tuttle's phenomenal book,"I have had the honor of meeting Will Tuttle in person, and I'm very glad I did--he is ""the real deal,"" deeply spiritual and deeply humanitarian. His book is THE best-you can't go wrong in reading it. In fact, it will show you the way to go right. I particularly concur with Delisa Renide's review; very well said indeed. GET THE BOOK, READ IT, and SHARE IT!"
3,questionable discription,"I only just started this book. But am becoming quite aware that among other very interesting topics I'm sure,this book is about eating meat. Or reasons why it would be preferable if we didn't. Not that I have anything against that, my only problem is that the description didn't really accurately tell that that's what the book would be about. My only gripe so far. I guess I thought it would be more about the history, mythology, and spiritual significance of food in general. But like I said, I haven't finished it so maybe I should."
2,Lauable goals but falls short,Limiting or eliminating the use of animals for food is a laudable goal. This book falls short of having wide appeal beyond the already converted.Good points:-The quotes from vegetarians and vegans throughout history that start each chapter.-Mr. Tuttle's conversion story.Bad points:-Theories are laid out with little or no justification. Mr. Tuttle is not a scientist.-Phrases are repeated over and over. The book could have used a good editor.-The elites of the meat -military-faming-medical-pharmaceutical-government-media cabal of the dominant herding culture that suppresses the feminine collude to control the underclass and constantly supply their industries with a constant supply of victims. If you believe this then you will love this book.
3,Nothing new under the sun,"Another holier than thou book, this was a disappointment. It is the same old argument for a vegan diet. I totally support a vegan lifestyle, and I support the ideas in this book, but it is nothing new. Tuttle is a bit full of himself as he thinks this is a revelation. I have lent this book to several friends who have had much the same reaction. So, if you are new to the concept of choosing a diet for its spiritual and global effect, this would be a good book to read, as would John Robbins books and many others of this genre. This book, however is not any more ""special"" than any others."
5,The World Peace Diet will change your life......,"We are going through a planetary crisis right now. Did you know that everything going on in the world is connected? Do you know that the majority of people eating animal products have absolutely no idea how it gets from the farm to their fridge? Do you know that most people are very disconnected from their emotions and do things out of habit and family culture? You owe it to yourself, the environment, the animals and this earth to read this book, and open your mind to the ideas. This book will set you free, and start you on a road to joy, compassion, and freedom. Thank you, Dr Will Tuttle for this life changing book."
5,A Journey of Compassion,"I am completing the World Peace Diet Facilitator Training today (7/31/2012) and I can honestly say that reading The World Peace Diet is a life-changing book that shows us how making informed, compassionate food choices can affect - and change - our entire environment.This book covers so much - I am still amazed that Will Tuttle, PhD. was able to put all of this into one book. Parts of the book are difficult to read. It is not easy for us to realize how cruelly animals are treated. Yet this is something that needs to be made public - not in a judgmental way - in a compassionate way. Once we are made aware of what is wrong - we can make the changes necessary where cruelty is replaced with compassion. Where pain and separation are replaced with kindness and community.This is what Dr. Tuttle's book has brought to my awareness - the necessity that we are all connected - that what affects one soul...affects us all."
5,The Most Necessary Read To Save Our Planet!!!,"This book is a must-read, informing us of how to create world peace through the power of our food choices. Read to find out more."
5,Life-Changing Book,"For me this was an absolutely life-changing book. It provides all the reasons for becoming vegan. I had been reading lots of material regarding health that made me consider reducing animal foods. After I read this book and had all the other reasons for it besides health I completely changed my diet. It helped me lose quite a bit of weight and I am feeling the best I have in my entire life physically, mentally, and spiritually.Frank B."
5,Truly amazing,This is an amazing mind opening book! I recommend this book for everybody! Easy to read and super enlightening. I have already been talking about it to all my friends and family
5,Life Changing,"This book is the most comprehensive look at how our diet affects animals, the planet and each other. It gave me an epiphany about how my diet is truly a spiritual experience every day. I went vegan for my health, I stay vegan for the animals, thanks in large part to Dr. Tuttle. I would recommend this book to everyone."
5,"Important Book, written with love","This book should be read by every compassionate humanon the planet. There are 3 excellent reasons for eatingless meat: 1) help the planet and the environment, includingreducing global warming 2) your own health and 3) themost important reason of all is for the welfare of the animals"
1,Very disappointing,"I am so disappointed in the ESV edition of the Reformation Study Bible.First, the annotations are glib with no substance.Second, there is no red letter print for the words of Christ.Next, there are no maps in the back of the Bible.Finally, I just had to put it aside and use other study Bibles and resources because this one lacks so many necessities.How can you call this a study Bible with no maps!!!!Yes, there are little maps scattered here and there in the text, but these don't give you a broad picture."
3,Faithful to the text but lacking a few features..,"I am currently reading through the NT in this Bible. I appreciate that the ESV is more faithful to the original languages than the NIV, however this ESV Study Bible seems to pale in comparison to Zondervan's NIV Study Bible. I have noticed that there have been a number of verses in the NT that this ESV Study Bible ignores, or gives virtually no attention. The NIV Study Bible addresses virtually every verse in the Bible. Also this ESV Bible seems to lack the depth of maps, charts, tables and other features found in the NIV Study Bible. Its just so annoying having a question about a verse, and not being able to rely on the limited study bible notes found in this bible.Other than this, this is a good bible and more faithful to the original authors than the NIV."
5,awesome,great deal very quick it was a great gift idea from what i understand they love it and take it everywhere
2,"If you can ignore the study notes, good Bible.","The study notes ruin this Bible for me. I bought it for my little sister and was shocked when I found the notes supporting Preterism of all things. Also, Sproul goes out of its way to promote Calvanism which isn't nearly as bad, but begs the question if we really need people promoting their theology, no matter what view they hold, in God's Word. There a quite a few times in this Bible where there is almost as much commentary as Bible on the page, and the commentary is pretty biased or even pretty cowardly. He doesn't even comment on Acts 7:51 and resisting the Holy Spirit ( the ""I"" in TULIP ).Just don't fall into the trap of depending on men to interpret the Bible for you. Meditate on God's Word and wait till He speaks to you through His Holy Spirit. Commentaries have their place, but it's not before the Spirit."
3,Recycled Study Bible,"I was realy looking forward to reading this study bible. I started with the introduction and was instantly struck by its familiarity. I pulled my NKJV New Geneva Study bible off the shelf and started comparing them side by side. The introduction, chapter introductions, sidebars etc. are identical. Even the footnotes are the same apart from an occaisional variation in the bold footnote heading. Not surprisingly, the list of contributors is also identical. Apart from the actual ESV translation, this bible is the same as my 1995 New Geneva Study Bible. The only other difference is that my 1995 edition has four short articles at the end.I was hoping for something new, but I was disappointed. If you don't alread own the New Geneva Study bible, then this may work for you. But I will pick up a cheaper ESV edition, just for the translation."
4,"Great, but....","Great study bible. I can say, beyond doubt, this is the most doctrinally pure Study Bible. Very readable. I prefer the NIV for reading, but since this bible is meant for ""serious study"" the ESV was a great choice. Defends the doctrines of Grace. True to the reformed tradition, supports infant baptism. However, the authors are not dogmatic and clearly state that there are many brethren who hold other positions.One major FLAW is in prophecy. All the reformers and the founders of mainline churches clearly stated that the papacy is the antichrist, Islam is the other horn of the antichrist, The Roman Church is the whore of babylon, etc...It is, at best, misleading to avoid these.In conclusion, I don't regret in one bit buying this great study tool. However, for the reason I mentioned above, I'm slight disappointed,..However, no study bible is perfect. And, with the options available today (infected with ""I'm in charge Arminianism, and sci-fi eschatology), this is a NO-BRAINER.Get it!"
2,Disappointed,"This could be a great study-Bible, but its not. The ESV is the most accurate translation from the original tongues and is highly regarded as such. This version needs a great deal of ""polishing up"" to make a great study-Bible. The print needs to be darker for starters; the concordance is lacking; maps are very distasteful, the notes are not easy to read, and it lacks depth. I would not buy this again if I had it to do over. It is a very mediocre study-Bible as it is."
4,Pretty good...but there's better,"I purchased this study Bible for my wife because I already have the ESV Study Bible (ed. JI Packer). While the Reformation Study Bible is another good resource, I find the study notes to be a little less thorough, the cross references to be the same, and the articles and supplementary materials to be about equal. All in all, a good resource, but if you want immediate references to better understand the particular verses you are reading, then you will probably be happier with the ESV Study Bible."
5,"Review on ""The Reformation Study Bible""",I would recommend to those who are seeking to know in depth of the Scripture. It is an excellent Reformation Study Bible.
2,Not bad but didn't meet expectations,"I'm a regular reader of RC Sproul's books and Ligonier publications, such as TableTalk. I was expecting much more depth in this Bible. The notes don't have much substance overall, especially on passages critical to reformed theology. The articles are better. Maps and charts are limited for a study Bible. It's not bad, but if you are expecting a work comparable to Ligonier standards, you might be a little disappointed."
1,Ripped off big time,"I am a huge Eugenia Price fan, and was ordering a few books for my collection. This article was included in the list of books by and about Price. At $9.95, I expected to have an interesting read about Price's biography, as advertised. I payed the money, and was given access to one page, which basically spent most of the page, simply listing all the books Price wrote. Then, approximately 3 paragraphs summarizing her life; things I've already read on other sites at no cost."
2,misleading,"I am an Italian who moved abroad, and I bought this attractive book to show Italian food to non-Italians. The pictures are very attractive, but after careful analysis I realised that none of those ""artistic"" dishes looks like one you would actually see in Italy. The recipes look simple, but they probably have been changed to match the British taste. My girlfriend prepared ""gnocchi al pesto"" for me, and the taste was completely wrong: Italians would never put lemon in the pesto! Perhaps some of the recipes are fine, but I will never trust this book again. After long search I chose for my girlfriend ""Biba's Northern Italian cooking"", buy that one instead! Italian food is wonderful, don't let non-Italians spoil it."
2,A Fiasco!,Save your hard earned money and buy the Masterpiece Theatre version by the BBC. It's faithful to the spirit of Balzac's novel and is extremely well done. This version is an incoherent mess. Someone snorted a few lines of coke before making this Eurotrash version ....
2,Bad misfire,"I've never read the Balzac novel this movie is based upon, but if Balzac wrote a coherent story, it didn't make it to the screen this time around. The settings and costumes are glorious, leading one to expect somewhat high-brow entertainment, perhaps on the order of Merchant/Ivory. Not to be. A sophomoric joke repeatedly cropping up in the film is Elizabeth Shue's naked backside. Huh? Wouldn't the Gendarmes come running, in 1846 Paris? Sacre Bleu!None of these people are very nice, but they don't deserve the mischief Cousin Bette inflicts upon them. And what is Jenny Cadine's motivation for letting herself be used in Bette's schemes. Nothing makes sense, and the whole movie was just bad misfire. Avoid if possible."
2,"A mostly good cast, wasted on a poor script","A very uneven and rather unsatisfying, though beautifully costumed, film based on the writings of Balzac. Elisabeth Shue is very much miscast as a singer. She does not convince at all, and her accent is ridiculous. Jessica Lange, Bob Hoskins and Hugh Laurie do better, but the script is lacking. Too bad the latter three actors were wasted on this."
2,Please - before the 1972 videotape disintegrates!,"Oh PLEASE - whoever has the rights to dub off the original 1972 Masterpiece Theater TV series of 'Cousin Bette' do so and make it available on DVD. This was one of THE finest shows ever created for television. Truly, it totally eclipses the 1998 movie version and now, 40+ years later, I fear it will soon not be physically possible to render this production to DVD. For the sake of one of the theater (and humanity's) most glorious theatrical efforts, PLEASE make the original TV version available! (BTW - I rate the ORIGINAL item at 5+ STARS!)"
4,"Very funny movie, along the lines of Valmont","If you like a humorous/tragedy stricken movie, this one is for you. I admit I have to be in a certain kind of mood to watch it. Toby Stephens is sensational, and I think it's an outrageously funny performance by him. My only complaint is I wish he had more screen time. I wish he would take on more comedic roles - set aside the lovey dovey stuff (Jane Eyre) and the bad guy stuff (Die Another Day) and do some more comedy. He's brilliant!"
1,What a Stinker!,"God awful dramatization of Balzac's story of the same name. Lange and Shue are dreadfully miscast, and the script writer completely failed to capture this wry and bitter tale.If you want to see this story with real meat on its bones, try finding a copy of the 1971 Masterpiece Theatre production. Margaret Tyzack makes Jessica Lange look like milk toast."
2,An Awful Adaptation,"The costumes were great....but this movie did no justice to the novel. ""Cousin Bette"" the novel is excellent , ""Cousin Bette"" the movie, is dreadful. I understand some changes are necessary when a novel is adapted into a movie, but these changes were awful and they took something very important (the Baroness) away from the story...If you haven't read the novel, you will probably find this movie to be decent. If you have read the novel, be prepared to be very disappointed."
2,It's sure not Masterpiece Theatre,"After seeing Masterpiece Theatre's version approx. 1982, I was excited to see this. PBS has never reshown the Masterpiece since then, as far as I can discover. Anyways, this movie was okay, just not something to write home about. Still, what could they do with a 2 hr movie, versus 6 one hour shows.However, I ordered the paperback, unabridged book and it is delicious! The book is TRULY something to read."
4,1215: The Year of Magna Carta,"This book gives an overall view of the period, way of life, and political system that led to the signing of The Magna Carta and gives us practical view of what living under the rule of King John was like for all classes. This book is easy to read and super informative, a very enlightening read."
4,History Class,"I am a high school student going into Sophomore year, and 1215: The Year of Magna Carta was one of my summer reading books. At first I thought it wouldn't be very interesting because from what I had heard it was basically a history textbook in paperback. However, when I read it, I found that the detail makes it so hard to look away from the page! This book is really well written, and no matter what age you are, you'll enjoy it."
4,Informative and entertaining,"This book brings to life the middle ages in a way that most ""history books"" seem unable to do. Rather than tell us about twelfth and thirteenth-century England in dry chronological order, each chapter addresses a particular social, political, or religious topic. By doing so, the narrative travels across two centuries in a discontinuous fashion but gives the reader a much better understanding of how political and religious conflicts led to the writing of the Magna Carta.Not every topic seems equally-well researched and described, but still, this book delivers the goods for those wanting to understand events that so heavily shaped western democratic principles of government.While not quite on the level of a David McCullough biography, the authors nevertheless manage to entertain while informing."
3,"Some interesting parts, but overall lacks depth","I was excited to read 1215, but ended up disappointed by it. It sets out to describe life in England before and after the signing of the Magna Carta. It also has a section with all the provisions in the MC. Some parts were fascinating while others were dull and left me pushing to get through them. I also agree with another review I read here that there isn't enough depth to their history. Too many people and events are glossed over. The authors chose a very complex subject and tried to cram it all into a short, readable book. This was a tumultuous time in English history but this book didn't do enough to take you there."
1,What a bore!,"I tried to play dumb to read along, but since from the very beginning all the clues were so obvious, I really didn't know why I had to play sucker along with this poorly plotted dumbfounded book. I finally threw it away before the airplane landed. I put it at an obvious place and tried to suck another guy to bore to death. Ridley Pearson is another very unstable author, I could only recommend his first(?)book, UNDER CURRENT, besides it, I really didn't know why he kept writing boring stuff"
5,Stellar performance,"My first Ridley Pearson novel. Excellent characterizations and pacing. I loved Pearson's ability to draw the villain as an ancient witch doctor, offering up blood sacrifices, cutting out hearts and throwing them to the jackals. The mythic undertones make this novel really rock! I'll be reading more from this guy!"
4,A great read,Creepy and spooky! If you need something to read on vacation this is a good book. Fast paced and engaging.
2,Not as good as his others,I generally like Ridley Pearson's books (although he can be a little uneven) but this was awful. I threw it away when I was done - and I NEVER throw out books
3,I think Pearson can do better then this,"On one of the reviews the reviewer mentions that the first 100 pages were interesting, then the book became a congealed mass. I agree totally. I can see that Pearson has a lot to give to his reader, but he needs to improve on his stories. Details that matter are left out and ones that don't matter are put in. He is easy reading though and good for a fast ride."
2,"long, repetitive, mildly interesting","I'd recommend UNDERCURRENTS, but not this one. A good first hundred pages, but the story congeals into a mass of repetitive cliche as you are pounded again and again with the same info, until it picks up pace again in the finale. Some interesting stuff, but this able craftsman stretches the story into boredom land."
3,Lacks depth,"Book contains very little description of Bennett's quality films or analysis of them - concentrating only on the Tarzan films and serials. Much of the bio is written like a fanclub puffery piece - painting Bennett as a superhero. Numerous photos sections, from private holdings, are excellent and worth the price of the book - if not the main reason to do so."
5,Please Don't Call me Tarzan by Mike Chapman,This publication is a comprehensive life story of Herman Brix/Bruce Bennett. This book contains professional and personal photos reflecting the athlete and actor through his life and career that spanned 90 years from a seven year old boy to 2001. Well presented and very interesting.
5,This is a terrific book.,"The book contains some great insights into people, situations, and the kind of love that Jesus would have us live. It is really worth reading."
3,Embracing the Love of God....,"Some very good areas to consider for personal and group discussions, leading to a deeper understanding of how God's love works within the obedient heart. However, some of its content regarding self-acceptance and self-love are weakened by a mksunderstanding of the full role of the Holy Spirit within a believer's life and growth up into Christ. Human efforts gets us frustrated and leads to despair. We are His workmanship, and our efforts must be surrendered to those of the Spirit of God. The needed growth cannot ever be achieved apart from the empowering of the Spirit of God."
5,Wonderful book!,"This book was sooo good...Please don't hesitate to get it! Take your time, and drink in the love of God that comes through the pages...Nothing can separate us from the LOVE of GOD! That is what James Smith explains so well in this book. I just finished it, and know I will read it again. This book encouraged me and lifted me up. He definitely has a gift from God...to teach, help, and encourage...with references throughout, to the Word of God. I look forward to reading more of his books. As another reader said, this book will probably become a classic."
2,Not worth the money,"We have two of these bibs. At first I loved them because we had just switched from the cloth bibs. These were bigger, easy to clean and had a pocket to catch food; so I ordered more. However, over time the Velcro in the back becomes twisted and makes it easy for the child to pull off. Also, it can’t go in the washer. If you are going to spend the money buy the Skip Hop. They are adorable, can be thrown in the washer and the Velcro attachment is a much better design."
4,Thrown A Sweet Knuckle-curve,"An astute, honest, sensitive, tasty look at immigration, professional baseball, maturity and the magic of baseball as just a game. My favorite moments were the waitress and egg scene and the Vic Power story about eating black people. My only suggestions would be that I'm not sure the ""Law and Order"" style of filming always was the best choice, especially when filming the baseball scenes and the movie is a tad long, but its authenticity makes it worth it. Rated PG-13 for some sexual situations, language and brief drug use."
4,Baseball tale,"Story of a youngster from the Dominican Republic who is selected by the fictional team the Kansas City Monarchs to come to the US to play baseball. We see him at Spring Training trying to learn the American ways.He gets sent to the Mid-West to stay with a sponsor family, he wants to hook-up with their hot daughter, but she declines. He gets injuried, takes some medicine but ultimately he washes out.So, he decides to go to New York to wash dishes and play sandlot baseball with other ballplayers who did not make it either. Mostly spoken in Spanish so it is English sub-titled, fun to see if you can figure out what they say without the sub-title. A view of what it is like to be an immigrant here."
4,Sugar is Sweet!,"I really liked this movie. It gave us a sneak peek at what goes down in these Dominican baseball camps. The actors were so natural. Argelis did not show one sign that he is a rookie in acting. This is his first film. He was auditioned right on the set. In my opinion he did a great job and played the part perfectly. The movie is sad and if we put ourselves in Sugar's shoes we will see that life is not easy. I am bummed that this movie was not PG13 rating on the blue ray. I had to get the dvd version to enjoy it. I believe the R rated stuff was not necesary and should have been cut from the get go. The scenes are totally irrelevant to the movie. Also, I believe the ending could have been better. It just ended so suddenly, without any further explanation of how Sugar adapted to NY."
1,Disappointing,"If you are looking for a sports-related video to encourage young people to follow their dreams, look somewhere else. I decided to preview this video that was bought as a present for a Christian friend who is deeply involved in youth baseball. The dirty language and improper statements and attitudes toward women were enough for me to stop it and throw it in the trash.Perhaps the life protrayed in the video was lived just as it was filmed. That would be unfortunate."
4,Mini Backgammon,"I bought this Backgammon set for travel, when I fly. I needed something compact and portable, and this looked like it would work. Wow! It is small! It is small enough to put on my carry-on bag and is very useful just as I bought it.I bought a metal souvenir shot glass to use as a dice cup, and I keep the pieces in a small cloth bag inside. The pieces are loose otherwise.It's really fun, and about the size of the smallest chess set I own. It is very high quality wood, and appears to be hand made. I can't believe something so nice is sold for such a low price. Closed it is 5 7/8"" long, 4 3/8"" wide, by 1 1/2"" thick.If you like to take your backgammon game with you, this is the set for you."
2,"""NOT A GEM ESPADRILLE PUMP""","This shoe was not worth the price I paid for it. It was highly over-priced. It is just a plain fabric shoe with broad turquoise shoelaces criss-crossed at the top. IT WAS MOST CERTAINLY NOT A ""GEM"" OF AN ESPADRILLE PUMP!!!!I must admit it is a comfortable shoe, my disappointment was in the quality of the workmanship and the beauty."
5,Billie Holiday Review,It is a great book that is very interesting. It is not dry and is very detailed in what it says. I would suggest it to anyone interested in Billie Holiday.
3,"Two guys from National Lampoon's Animal House got the press, but another strong single and video from Cheap Trick","Steve Furst and Tim Matheson from Animal House triedto carry this sort of turkey but the real star of theshow was Jon Brant's dog, Chuck (r.i.p), and that singleand video by the Tricksters ruled!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,UP THE CREEK- finally on DVD!,"As I laid my old worn-out VHS copy of UP THE CREEK to rest a few years ago, it was a real treat to get this DVD release in hand. Like some other big companies, MGM has released this as a bare-bones release in the 'dvd-on-demand' mold. The menu is sparse with no scene selection (though there are directions telling viewers to use their forward/backward buttons to go back/ahead about 10 minutes per scene). UP THE CREEK itself is in widescreen, and looks as good as it's ever bound to look since I saw it in a theater back in April 1984. The audio is good and clear (80's tunes, dialogue & sound FX) and images are clear and quite sharp, making the outdoor scenes pleasing to watch. There is also a decent heavily-80's style trailer."
3,A Forgotten Comic Gem,"UP THE CREEK merged some of the actors from ANIMAL HOUSE with some of the actors from PORKEY'S. That's quite a combination. This film doesn't have the energy as the other two, but it is a pretty decent movie. Basically it's another snobs vs slobs theme with fraternities having a river rafting race as the backdrop. Some pretty good comic moments and stunts with the river rafting sequences and funny characters. Overall, an entertaining film with a good comic cast."
2,skipped,the movie was new but had to keep skipping half of movie because it keeped freezing other then that the time it took to get here was good
5,It's a Dumfah,"Had this movie forever on VHS. Took a long time to find on DVD.For a good time get this movie. It's still a good time for this era, and a break fom the work-day. UP THE CREEK!"
3,"Nation of Nations, Volume 1: To 1877",This books seem to follow the time line accurately without leave to many gaps where there apparently is no history. This books sometimes use language that is somewhat confusing but all in all the book is pretty average.
5,The Pinelands,"My wife gave me this book in 1978, and I devoured it in one evening. I have since been all over the world, and no matter where I go, the pines are always the reference point for me. My teen years were spent in the pines, with my good friend Tom, where we would travel its dirt roads, canoe its streams and fish its lakes, and hike its trails and roads. Mr. McPhee weaves a story that is so true, so historically rich, and for me, so reminiscent of the years of my youth. Please read this book, and then go and make your own memories."
1,Bad Execution and battery life,"I ordered 1 from amazon and I am waiting for about 60 days and they expect to ship it in October of 04. Bought 2 ugly blue ones at another online site and I am having a nightmare with it. It skips like crazy when working out and even after a full days charge dies in battery time after 2hrs of use. The color shading is also strange , it differs from top to bottom. Also the quality of the sound seems poor with the default headphones. I purchased some fontopia ones and it seems clearer. The second mini which was a present was DOA, and calling apple did not help as they want to replace it with a refurb."
1,dont buy this,dont buy the iPod mini...because you can have 5 TIMES the capacity for just 50 DOLLARS MORE! Buy the NEW iPod 20GB and you bill save $$$...$300 is a lot cheaper than 5 ipod minies!
1,BUYER BEWARE,dont buy this piece of garbage mine died after 2 uses i returned it to get the 20gb it is only 50 bucks more for 5 TIMES THE MEMORY!!!!! dont bother w/ the mini. it is also really ugly.
1,don't bother if you have a laptop and windows,"This is my first Apple experience and what a disaster.The IPOD itself is very nice, but to use it you need a windows installation and from what I have learned so far, if you have a laptop, you're up a creek. Apple has not support/warranty to speak of so you are on your own. Blue screen of death, spontaneous reboot, probably another $50 for a firewire card that might fix things, and no idea , no FAQ, no nothing at apple to help. This is like dealing with Microsoft."
2,"great device, if you don't need it often","The sound is wonderful. Setup is easy. Unfortunately, batterly life is really, really bad. If you charge it and start playing, you may get up to 2 hours of listening time. Unfortunately the battery runs down when you AREN'T listening, too. So, when I listened for an hour and then did not recharge overnight, by the next morning the battery was out. And it does not recharge quickly, it takes 3-4 hours. This has made me disinclined to use it or carry it around -- it basically only works if I have JUST recharged it."
5,awesome,"This is for any normal person, like myself, who does not need over a thousand songs (or over 500 for that matter), wants something smaller and more convinient than the regular ipod, and does not want to be like the thousands of others with the original ipod. Words cannot even describe how this little machine has changed my life. BUY IT TODAY!!!"
1,Spring the extra 50 and get the 20 gig,"At first I was all, ""Woo Hoo"" but after 3 days my Ipod froze and never came back so I exchanged it at Best Buy for another one. 2 hours later, it turned off and never turned back on so I exchanged it for ANOTHER one and then this one had battery failure.Yes, it may be cute, but if you're gonna put up that kind of money, get the 20 gig. After I got my full refund and a month later on my birthday I bought the 20 gig and I LOVE it! I can fit 20 times more songs and it's reliable! And a month later @ Best Buy I oddly saw 4 ipods on markdown out of box. (I swear to God those are all mine)"
1,Not Good,"Product was shipped quickly... so quickly they sent the wrong color. I ordered a blue one and they sent me a silver one. But everything seems to be working fine and I didn't feel like sending it back before xmas because it was a present.As a follow-up, the battery died within a few months and because it had been a gift, I didn't know about it because the receiver felt bad and didn't want to tell me."
5,I love my ipod Mini!,"I received the pink mini for my birthday and have already half filled it with my favorite songs! I love its versatility and compact size. I have had no problems (yet), although I do recommend upgrading the earphones to the more expensive version...they seem to fit better. Now, we even have a second mini in the house (although this one is gold and my husband's!)!"
2,Not what I thought,"Battery drains pretty quickly and the iPod freezes a lot. It also ""dumps"" all your music and then they magically reappear sometimes after freaking out over losing everything you've worked so hard to convert and add. It doesn't take wma files so you have to convert them to mp3. iTunes isn't the only program that works with the iPod Mini like Apple says, Real Player works as well. I should have listened to my brother on this one, his Philips mp3 player uses all formats."
2,Poor battery: approx 5.5 hours,"I don't usually write reviews but I was so badly treated (or rather: ignored) by Apple's service that I felt I should warn others. Beware of the battery rating. ""8 hours"" means one song played over and over. Under ordinary circumstances you will average about 5.5 hours. And, heaven forbid, you should skip to the next song, you can drive the battery down to 4 hours or less.On the positive side: the wheel interface is very good."
1,bad product/was not working,this product was terrible. it did not work and they said it was in working order...took several weeks to get my money back but i did finally get it. THANK GOD! i dont mind paying for something that works and looks good but this device was not what he said it was!!!!
2,Refurbished I-Pod,"Looks good but doesnt keep a charge more than a couple of hours. might be good for a childs first in case they loose it or mistreat it but If a serious music listener, may want to spend the $ TO GET IT NEW."
3,I remember when this was the bees knees,"Seems so ancient now...After a year or 2 though the LCD just came and went , some kind of construction issue..."
1,Disappointed,"We ordered the ipod-mini directly from Apple. Caution! They don't have all the bugs worked out of it. It freezes up and requires the user to either plug it in and reset it or reload its software which erases all the songs you have downloaded on to it. We have had to do this twice and its very time consuming. Then the menu screen became unstable, it scrolled non-stop. Finally, the menu screeg quit working altogether. Iin a few days it quit working altogether. For a new product, not very good. We have had it less than a month. My advice, wait and let them get the bugs out of it. Apple customer service was less than customer friendly."
4,Nice,"Nice. Everythings great, but there's too many accessories to buy. I spent more money on accessories than the iPod mini, itself. And, now there's a 4 GB and a 6 GB starting at $199 with a longer battery life."
5,AWESOME,"These mini ipods are awesome! It is like having a mini radio in your pocket, but listening to whatever song you want to.Keyword:AWESOME AND GOOD MUSIC!"
1,ipod mini,I love my ipod mini and was heartbroken when it broke. Bought this one online and received it in the same broken condition. Contacted seller and she refunded my money promptly. Bought a ipod nano 3rd generation and it is even better than the mini.
3,lots of hype....,"Like most people, I saw the ads and wanted an iPod mini, too. I liked the design, controls, and size. Then I did a little research, and I'm really glad I didn't rush out and buy one like I wanted to. Something none of the commercials tell you is about having to have an iTunes account and pay for the music you put on your iPod mini.Second, iPod has that battery that you can't remove... when your battery goes dead and you need to replace it (as rechargeable batteries do from time to time, such as in your cell phone or cordless home phone) guess what? You have to go to an Apple store to get them to fix it. Ugh.So while it may look cute and come in those nice colors, iPod is not the machine for me."
3,Was good...For 3 months,"Well, I got the ipod mini for Christmas, and for the first 3 months, everything went smoothly. However, I dropped it on a wood floor (the first time I've dropped it), and the screen broke completely! So now, it's useless. Blehhg."
2,the price RISES yet again,"about 4 weeks ago the price to get this same thing (ipod mini)was $180. Now it's $205. are you nuts apple makes their ipods for a little less than $30 and their selling them for $205. It's a total rip off. i would not get an ipod mini unless the price is below $150. Sure it's great with all it's songs and extra features but, it's not worth the money. I'd wait for the price to drop before you buy an ipod mini."
5,A Great Gift for yourself.,"Just get one!!I got mine and it is so cool.Easy to download the songs,use the games,set clock,and everything else.If you buy the Ipod Mini dock or use the armband or the belt clip.I warn you the paint will chip off.Its great I use mine all the time.Yes,you will have to replace the batteries.Incase your wondering.Get it if you dare."
4,Better than competitors,"IPod quality and design is unbeatable. Just a few cons, the sound quality of the included headphones is regular to bad, battery life is very short, the surface of the body is easy to scratch so you better get and IPod skin. I bought the Sennheiser PX 100 Headphones, the sound quality now is superb. Go for it !"
3,Great except when it sucks,"I loved it when it was working right, but 6 months after I first got it, Itunes crashed while updating the ipod and the hard drive got corrupted.Luckily, you can still buy the AppleCare protection if it's been less than a year so I got it and they sent me a new Ipod.That worked great for almost a year but then my battery life got really short (1 hour or so). I sent it back again, since I was still covered by AppleCare, but they told me they wouldnt cover it because it was caused by abuse! I never did anything ""abusive"" to it, I dropped it maybe once or twice, and I dont see how that would cause it to work fine except for the reduced battery life.I realize they dont make this model anymore, but I'm definitely goign to look around at the other makers before I get my next MP3 player. And apparently it's barely worth getting applecare for the battery issue alone."
1,P.O.S.,"I know that everyone else seems to love this, so perhaps my complaint is more about Apple in general. My Ipod Mini (pink)is a lemon. The battery has never worked properly. It takes longer to charge than to discharge, and my current playing time per charge (no changing settings, not backlighting, nothing but hitting play and waiting till the battery dies) is about 2 hours. Apple will gladly sell me a new ($70) battery, but other than that tough. It is apparently my fault thet they're selling shoddy products. I'm not saying don't buy it. There aren't realistically any better choices out there than the Ipod, but buy it when you have a week to sit around and evaluate it and when they get around to opening a store near you. As for me, I think I'm going to dig out my old discman."
2,Unreliable,"It's an older model, but I thought it would at least serve it's purpose. But it won't hold a charge. It can be charging all day and then I try and go for a run and it dies within minutes. So it's sort of useless."
3,IPOD,GOOD PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE AND HAS HELD UP AFTER THE MONTHS OF USE SO FAR BUT STOPPED WORKING. NO COMPLAINTS DUE TO PRICE PAID
2,Mechanical Problems...,"It worked fine for all of a few days, but it started freezing up. I could still restart it, but eventually it just stopped working at all. Now I get the Ipod Sadface and it makes whirring noises. It won't even be recognized by Itunes anymore...It's the perfect size for me, but not if I can't get it to work again..."
1,Static-Crackle-Useless after 1 month of use,"After receiving my ipod mini from a friend in the USA (I am a UK resident), I lovingly listened to it for about a month, then it all went rapidly downhill... When I now play it, the slightest movement, touch of the beautiful aluminium casing, all I can hear is crazy static, screeching noises.After visiting other ipod web forums, it appears to be quite a common fault. Checkout"
1,Headphone Jack Problems,"This IPOD is prone to headphone jack problems after about a month of use. Any type of movement now cause static during song play. Any headphones I try do the same thing. I have read about this problem on several places on the net. Apples response...""There is a one yr warranty"". Guess that is their excuse for selling an inferior product."
4,overall good product,"I love my ipod, there are only a few things I didnt like. I had to re-install the software because the first time it didnt go right and itunes couldnt recognize my ipod.. no problem.. un-installed, re-installed, that time it went fine.. so it took some time for all this but its ok because the manual said to charge it for 4 hours anyway.. it is easy to organize my songs on itunes, i have several playlists so it makes choosing songs on the ipod simple. the earbud quality is ok, not fond of them because they can fall out easily. the wheel is very sensitive and i accidently turned up the volume too loud, gave myself a shock! so I learned to use the lock feature so that wouldnt happen. love the smal size and easy to use, you can get lots of accesories for it. i've used it for 3 days now and still am halfway through the battery life bar. I like not having to eat through so many batteries. thumbs up!!"
5,So Good Words Can NOT Describe,"MY Ipod Mini is really cool.I got the green one.Its really easy to use and great for car rides,exersising and just for enjoyment.A couple of warnings:If you buy the dock DONT use it all the time because the paint will chip off.Also dont use the Belt clip a lot becuase the paint will chip off too.I would reccomend getting a car charger,apple care,dock,and an armband.Same with armband dont use it a lot because the paint will chip off."
5,Awesome Product,"I've had many mp3 players, but this is my first Ipod. I'm very satisfied with the product. It's the perfect size for strapping to your arm and going jogging. No skipping whatsoever. The optional armband is very comfortable too. My only complaints are that is doesn't include an FM radio and the earbuds are of low quality. I picked up some Sony MDR-E828LP for $11.00 which sound great. I can store about 650 songs on mine, which is a decent amount. I also like the fact that you can illuminate the lcd display so that people can see you jogging at night. I've owned mine for a little over 3 months now with no problems."
4,"Easy to set up, works great, but one complaint.","I just got my blue ipod mini today from the apple website. It took me about 30 minutes to install all the software and register my ipod at the iTunes website. I don't plan on buying any music at the iTunes store, I just wanted to transfer my favorite songs from my vast CD collection to my ipod. The color is very rich and vibrant, it looks great and works with ease. My only gripe is that they don't give you a USB power adaptor for an electrical socket. Since they don't include one with your ipod mini, you have to charge it buy keeping it connected to your computer. Also, the computer has to be kept ON while the ipod charges. I hate having to leave my computer on for 4 hours while my ipod is charging. I recommend that you also buy a power adaptor so that you can charge your ipod from an electrical socket. I know I'll need one for when I go home, and am not able to take my computer with me."
2,I will never buy an iPod product again!,"My fiance bought me the iPod shuffle for my birthday. We tried it on THREE different computers and it didn't work on ANY of them! So, we tried to return it and bought an iPod Mini. What a mistake! Within the first couple of hours the screen's contrast went to nothing-- and we even had it on the darkest setting. Then, the next morning the screen decided to be visable again. BUT, on the fourth day, the thing just froze! I couldn't turn it off or anything! So, it made me feel like those days back in college when I had to use Apple computers and the disk drive would freeze. They never had a disk drive eject button. Why does Apple do this stuff-- doesn't make sense. So, this one is going right back to the store. I would like a digital player, but just won't buy an Apple one again."
1,DON'T BUY from Circuit City,"i've had a beastly experience from trying to buy an ipod from circuit city. when i got the ipod, i slid the box out of its sheath and the whole thing tumbled out! simply put somebody had already opened the box earlier! the packing inside was in tatters. i didnt touch the product.i called circuit city and complained that they had sent me an already opened box. they initially told me that i would have to ship it back to them on my own cost. then when i argued with them they told me that they would pick it up. a week passed but it was never picked up. the when i called they said they werent responsible for open packages because they couldnt verify it being open when i received it (why else would i want to return it if not for this? if the product was defective i would have complained so) and that if i returned it i would have to pay a 15% restocking fee!i'm at my wits end with this company. buyers BEWARE!"
3,Apple iPod Mini,"I just bought this Apple iPod Mini at Target a few weeks ago. I downloaded iTunes and now I'm on my way downloading songs. I like the iPod Mini because it has a compact design which I could take to work or for a jog easily. I wish though this would hold more songs. It only hold 1,000 songs while Dell Jukebox holds about 2,500 songs. I wish I got the Apple iPod Photo because it can hold up to 15,000 songs (60 Gigabytes) and it has a color screen and of course can hold your family photos. The iPod mini is good but it just doesn't live up to it's bigger sibling"
5,"Really cool, better than the big iPod","For my birthday, i wanted this really bad. It was out of stock every where in MD, so my mom got the 15g iPod, but i still had my name on a waiting list for an iPod mini and ended up getting both. For 2 days, i had both, and i was really torn on which one to keep. The big iPod is only cool because it had more space. i dont like the touch sensitive buttons; the press buttons on the mini respond better. I only have 2.4 gb of music. but being able to back up my computer on the 15 gb iPod would be cool, like in run away jury, i could erase my computer of sensitive material in case some1 was going to sack my house and computer. But as it turns out, i dont have highly clasified material on my comp, so i would never use it. so i ended up keeping the mini because i still have room to expand my music collection and it fits in my hand a lot better and it is a lot better for running with because its lighter and smaller."
1,Not so cool,"I purchased a Creative MP3 player in the summer but decided to buy an Ipod because of its range of features and cool factor. The Ipod's MENU button never worked and without the MENU button you can't navigate through the system. I followed the manual explicitly and reset the Ipod countless times to no avail.After reading many users describe the same problem on the Ipod discussion board I opted for a full refund rather than a replacement: Amazon's refund policy and procedures are excellent.For now I'll stick with the Creative MP3, which works well. The Ipod is hip, but only if it works.Happy New Year!"
5,I Love It,"When the iPod mini came out, I really liked it for the reason that it was an iPod that was 50 dollars cheaper and was even smaller then the diminuitive iPod with less space (I didn't have half as much music back then). I would really kill for a bigger iPod mini, but I guess you get what you pay for when it's out. Rio has a 5GB mp3 player thats the size of the iPod mini with some new hard drive, I hope that's in a new iPod mini by christmas. Sometimes I get criticized by owners of the bigger, ""less cool"" iPod, I think they're just jealous."
1,WATCH OUT!!!!!!!!!,"The ipod itself may be a good product; however, beware! I ordered one as a christmas present for someone. The ipod was in an unopened package BUT IT HAD SOMEONE ELSES NAME ENGRAVED ON IT. Amazon swears it was a mistake. I was so humiliated when the person called me to tell me they already registered the ipod, downloaded songs and then noticed a ladies name on it. I gave it to a man. Personalized items should not be returned and accepted by a company. After several emails I was only credited $20. I paid $255 in total and all I get back is $20!! Not to mention they sent a replacement which is not what I wanted, WITHOUT telling me first. The person doesn't want to download everything again. Now I'm stuck with returning the item. I'm considering never ordering from amazon again!"
4,Great Product,"This item is terrific - it holds an aedequate amount of music and I have not had any problems with it even though I bought it when it first came out.The only things I don't like are the premium price for the size, especially since it's really not that much smaller, and the iTunes software."
1,Didn't work with Windows XP,"Just bought mine here on Amazon - tried to install the iTunes software on my Dell XP system - got an error message ""cannot find or create required iTunes folder in My Music. Called Apple support, after discussins with two tech support folks, answer was ""windows problem"". Have to return to Amazon."
3,Mini?,This thing ain't so mini. It's at least the size of the picture if not bigger. What's the story? What does iPod stand for anyway? Why is the second letter capitalized and the first isn't?
5,Complements its big brother beautifully,"After the joy of getting 5283 tracks (some 27 minutes long) on my (relatively) new iPod 40GB, I could not resist the green mini iPod for those special occasions and short bicycle trips but mainly because it is a VERY sexy, sleek little lady which is a wonder of modern design and technology. Don't get me wrong. I adore my wife and children and get all human pleasure I need from them but for my passion in music, my collection has received the justice it deserves. On it I have reserved only the very best tracks from the best music - such as John Coltane's CRESCENT, Anita O'Day singing SWEET GEORGIA BROWN, Miles Davis playing MILESTONES, Beethoven, Haydn Trios, etc As grandfather three times over, this little green mini has just added more joy to my autumn."
2,Why 4 Gigs?,Yeah I understand that its tiny and it holds plenty of music..but why would you pay $270 when you could pay the same price and get a 20 gig? I had a mini and I sold it and bought a 20...it just doesnt make sense to me...
1,Ipod is a rip off,"I overall love my ipod! The only problem is the rechargable battery when it goes dead cannot be replace with out sending it to the factory and me having to pay for the ipod again because they have to take it apart. Ipods are a rip off, don't buy on, by a better iRiver or something! I'll check back if something changes!"
3,Are you new in this area?,"If you have enough money to spend without a good reason , go ahead and buy this product, but just think about these features: is the memory big enough? you will put 700 common songs and you will fullit up! Can you move it to your stereo? if you like? why another brands offer 20 hour battery? For the same price you will have 5 times more music in other sistems, and you have the optional better batery! think twice ...."
3,Mixed Feelings,"This purchase was for my daughter's birthday. Wanted to get her an Ipod but given her age did not want to buy the latest and greatest. I thought if I could find a newer older generation of Ipod that would be best. Found this mini Ipod perfect color, perfect size, perfect memory, etc., the details of the Ipod when purchasing it stated NEW. When the Ipod arrived it was personalized with someone else's name, so it looks used, but it did not come with a used price tag. I am not real happy. The company (iPriceClub) we purchased it from did refund a percentage of the price. I still feel that I was deceived by iPriceClub.Also within the first 24 hours of use the Ipod has frozen up twice. I am NOT impressed."
1,unhappy,"The product that was sent looked wonderful,however it does not work. The iPod will not hold a charge.My mistake was not to notice there was not a return policy for this vender.Now I have a $70.00 lemon.This does not reflect against Amazon,but the individual vendor."
2,$189 for a new battery,After just 2 and a half years the battery went. It was never dropped or wet. The battery just went. They want $189 to install a new battery. I could buy a new one for $179.Tom the unhappy.Apple 4 GB iPod Mini Blue M9436LL/A
5,I Pod Mini is worth the money!!,"I just received my IPod Mini yesterday and I am completely enthralled with it. I am not overly technological and it was so easy to understand! It is simple to work, small, lightweight, cute as a bug, and holds all my music. It sounds incredible, like a complete stereo system. I can't recommend it highly enough. Apple has five gold stars with this product!!"
1,"Bought one, bought sixty songs from i tunes, can't hear one","Either I got a defective one, but after 4 hours with 7 different techs on the phone and calls to Apple Corporate, someone has agreed to exhange my unit for another one.My i-Tunes would load all the songs on to the i-pod, and you could pick a song, but it would never play, just go blank.Waited a month, had it engraved, now I have to wait for a box to return it, and then wait for another one and start over. I think it may be advisable to wait to they get the bugs worked out. 7 different techs could not figure it out. Or, maybe I got a bad one."
2,FEELING A LITTLE RIPPED-OFF,"I bought mine used and the original owner didn't tell me that the thing was a lemon. It doesn't hold a charge for longer than 2 minutes sometimes, even after charging for hours. The one I got must have a short-circuit in it or something. They're also like 2.5"" x 4"" x 1"" thick so it's a bit bulkier than I expected. But I mean...way less bulky than a tape or cd player so hey!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"I bought this ipod in February of 2004. It was great, but then about 2 or 3 months later, it stopped working. All I got was static. At first I thought it was the headphones, but after testing my $130 sony's on it, and they didn't work, I knew it was broken. I sent it back, and I'll give the store credit, I got a new one in a few days. But guess what, 9 months later, I'm having the same problem. Luckily, there are still 19 days in my warrenty, but I'm 100% positive that it will happen again. And when it does, the ipod won't be under warrenty. Then I'll have to buy a new one, because Apple charges $250 to fix broken ipods not under warrenty. I'll deffintly go for the 20 gig then. Bottom line, DO NOT BUY THIS. It works great at first, but it breaks easily. And by the way, it's not just an unlucky coincidence that both of them broke. I've talked to other people who had the same problem. DO NOT BUY THIS."
1,BY A BIGGER VERSION,Firstly my ipod never stops freezing and i have to reset it about 3 times when ever I use it! The battery last for about 1 hour and my older sister just got hers today and charged it for over 4 hours and it isnt working properly already. I highly recomend u DO NOT by a ipod mini they are usless pieces of junk that should be put in the dump!
3,i love it......when its working,"My ipod broke 2 times! 2 different ways, the 1st time there was a technical problem, i had 2 drive all the way 2 the only mall i know of that has an apple store (30 minute drive, an hr together). May i remind u, this happened 2 times. Now the second time it broke, it was my fault, i dropped it, but it should be durable enough for that. I love my ipod completely, and have since the day i bought it, but i am gonna take a hammer and smash it 2 pieces if i have 2 returned 1 more time. So i dont recommend this product to clumsy people, teenagers who aren't very sharp, and people with short fuses. And 2 ppl who already have 1 and are having problems, go 2 the support website. The website was SO helpful, and i promise SOME ONE has had the same problem, and will help with the problem. so good luck 2 some, beware 2 others."
4,Another Sucess Story for Apple,"We all know that quality is worth the wait. This will apply to the new Apple iPod Mini. The iPod Mini is by far, the best digital music player I've ever used. However, the new iPod is in great demand. Everyone wants it, yet it is out of most people's grasp. For now, that is. The Apple company made a rather large mistake earlier in the year, they didn't produce nearly enough of the mini's to meet demand. Hundreds of eager customers have added their name to a list of thousands to recieve a new iPod by the end of May. I know this as a fact becauseI, myself have searched exxtendedly for this product. I found that not a single store has them in stock at thids time. And in order to recieve one, you must order one, pay around $250, then wait three to five weeks to get one.April 18, 2004"
4,This product is hot.,"I love this product. Slick, smart design. The click wheel is very usable, although it prevents the Mini from obtaining the ""no moving parts"" solidity of the big brother. The 4 GB capacity is ok. I wish I could carry everything, but iTunes is darn good at getting the songs I want onto the pod. The smart playlists let you tackle whatever logic you want for picking the songs to synch. This is my first Apple anything, and so far it interoperates well with XP. NO COMPLAINTS. But it should have come with the armband and docking station. Stop being cheap, Apple."
1,8-hour battery life?,"Why does Apple insist on lying to its customers? Maybe an 8-hour battery life would be possible if one listened to the Ipod on very low volume, without touching the dial. But, isn't the joy of the Ipod that you're supposed to be able to skip over songs, mix up the order of your music... listen to What you want, When you want it? If you're like me, and using your Ipod as the Good Lord meant it to be used, you'll be lucky if your battery lasts 3 hours. Which means, almost every time I use my Ipod, the battery dies before I return home. So uncool. Especially since Apple promised otherwise."
3,Flat Sounding: Not much Bass,"I have had an Archos Recorder V2 for about a year now & it has been great. Recently I bought into the Apple ipod hype & got an Ipod MiniWhen I say that Archos is better sounding than Apple Ipod, I know it our of experience. Unless you haveused other mp3 jukeboxes, you might think that ipod has great sound. However, there are other better sounding products out there.Ipod for all its hype sounds flat; no bass or depth. Archos sounds fuller when playing the same songs. Ipod surelay has a great look & definitely a great interface. No doubt. Howver, at the end of the day I need a great sounding jukebox.Although Apple's Ipod looks great & is snaller in size than Archos, I care deeply about the quality of the music. And even with the best headphones & numerous tweakings, Ipod is flat. And, yes, I have tried all the EQ settings & with Seinheiser earbuds.Serves me right for buying into the hype."
3,great for the gym,"I didn't buy it at amazon, but i thought i'd leave a review any way. I mainly use this thing at the gym so battery life and storage space aren't issues to me. The only thing that stops me from giving this player 4 stars are the earphones. They suck and there always falling out. I use a pair of panasonic earphones that I bought for about five bucks and they work much better. The playback sounds good to me and it can go loud enough to cover up that annoying aerobics music my gym plays in the area I stretch in."
4,Love my iPod,"I've only had my iPod for a few days, but so far it's great. The sound is wonderful and the interface is easy to use. The touch wheel is a bit sensitive... I nearly rendered myself hearing impaired after accidentally turning the volume way up. I primarily use it at the gym and it's nice and light. When I'm running, I can use the clip it comes with to clip it to the machine, otherwise, I can clip it onto my shorts and it doesn't bother me at all.I had some problems installing, however. I'm using windows XP and the cd that came with the ipod didn't have the most current software for formatting the ipod, whereas I had the newest version of iTunes already on my computer. After downloading the newest software updates, everything worked just fine."
4,ipod mini review,I have had my ipod mini for 3 months & I have found it to be one of the best things I have ever bought.It is well designed easy to operate the instruction book is in plain English & the software easy to install even for a 50 year old former Ludite.My only small criticism is that no carrying case is included otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.So for all those people who spend endless hours travelling I would recommend you buy an ipod as it is much better to be able to listen to Bach or Charlie Parker than have to put up with the music provided by the airlines.I also find it good when reading or at the gym.In fact I am so impressed with my ipod that I am thinking of buying an Apple laptop computer just like Steve Jobs planned ( I hope I got his name right)!!!!!
4,Almost perfect,"After looking at many different mp3 players, I finally chose the ipod mini. Just about everything about it is excellent. The sound quality is superb, it is small and light (for a player with a hard drive), and itunes is really great. I only have two gripes about it. When I was first learning how to use it, I had a rather difficult time setting everything up. Other than that, it is way too expensive! Still this is a very good mp3 player. Congrats, apple."
4,Great device,I borrowed this item from a friend and used it for a cross country trip. I also got an FM modulator to plug it into my car cigarette lighter so I could hear it through my car stereo. It sounded pretty good and was great when I couldn't pick up any good radio stations.
4,Too cool for school,"I heard a quote somewhere; ""There are two kinds of people in this world, those that own an iPod and those that want an iPod."" I was in the later group, but when the mini came out, I had to be in the first group. The physical size is perfect and light. The only way the mini could be better is if it were cheaper (that's why I only gave it 4 stars). I was able to score the student discount so I got it for $229. The click wheel interface is the ultimate in usablity. I'm glad I didn't buy a regular iPod. My battery life has been slightly better than the specified 8hr span. Do I regret not getting the 20 or 40GB storage? NO WAY. The battery doesn't last the 4gigs worth of play, let alone 20 and I'm not afraid to take only the music I need. Fear of commitments? Buy the regular iPod. I'm ready to take the leap with my iPod mini."
1,Bad Seller or Bad product,"I bought a ipod mini and was so excited, when i opened the box the ipod cant charge and even read in the computer i tried doing everything i can to turn it on or charge it. I went to [...] they told me everything to turn it on and nothing this seller and product is not recommended"
3,Turns out to be working after all,"I did have problems with this device but turns out some people on the net had the same problems. So I let it sit for 24 hours and then hooked up to computer to charge for 6 hours and it is working again. I thought it was cooked but turns out to be ok. Don't let the mini go total dead on battery or you will have to do the same thing. There was no information with directions when I recieved, but fortunatley after Googling found info on how to fix."
4,Happy me.,"I am very satisfied witm my new Apple Ipod 4 GB mini. I can take it anywhere, movies, running and biking."
4,"Great little player, but....","Don't get me wrong, I love this player (more like my wife loves it, since it's hers). It is tiny, yet you can put so much music on it. But there are some shortcomings, although not much:1) Battery life is only 8 hours2) HAVE TO USE iTunes, can't drag and drop songs into the player3) Can't use some accessories made for iPodBut overall, I'd recommend it. But if you are like me and prefer functionality over appearance and size, get the iRiver iHP 120, it's only $50 more, but has a LCD remote, is the SAME size as a regular iPod, is 20GB, has FM tuner, microphone, is a TRUE hard drive player, AND has 16 hour battery life."
3,"mini but ""expensive"" ipod","when ipod unmini version first released in taiwan, i was shocked by its no-button and apple-style design, but i didn't buy it, cause its size is just too big and cannot support video type files.today, people also shocked by mini version ipod, but if you compare it's specification, you will find it still unsupport video files, and it's storage/price is very low, $249 plus $20 can buy 10GB unmini version ipod in amazon.If you don't care what i say, and want use a special version iPod different with what someone used before, mini iPod is your best choice, trust me^^"
2,iPod Mini in PINK!,I bought one of these for my wife and she loves it. I find it terribly over-rated.I especially hate the software under Windows - it was probably the worst installation procedure I have ever seen - not allowing you to customize what or where it is installed. Its like they thought we all want to be Mac users and just automatically do everything for us even though we would like control!It's also real buggy under Windows - always appearing to hang. And it is not ergonomic to update the iPod with new songs - it has to plugged in and out again constantly. It will not recognize new CDs unless you restart the software. My advise is to have the iPod unplugged all the time until you are ready to update the songs.There is a long way Apple has to go with this before it is as good as some of the other brands designed for Windows.
1,Died within 1 hour of buying it,"My wife was so excited to get one, we went to an Apple Store tonight, the first night they are on sale, to buy one. Brought it home. Charged it. Plugged it into the computer. It died. So tomorrow morning we have to drive all the way back there to get another. What a drag. I hope that the quality is a little better in the next one they give us."
5,beautiful little iPod,I love my pink iPod mini! =) It's easy to use and very aesthetically pleasing.
5,The Coolest Thing Since The CD Player,"This is the coolest piece of hardware I have ever bought. Great features. A must buy for anyone how does anything. Get it, or feel the consequences of seeing every other person on the street carrying one except YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Good, but not as good as her Greatest Hits","This compilation is not as well thought out as her Greatest Hits one. But I like the dance theme here and how they selected overlooked songs from the albums. TOuch ME, Naughty Girls, I Wanna Have Some Fun, and Do Ya are still solid songs. Her willingness to be diverse with urban sounds and rock heavy songs worked for her. The cassette version has only 8 (!) songs--wished that BMG could have put 10 on it."
1,Naughty Girls Need the Entire Song- Not a Butchered Version!!!,"I was aghast that the most popular song SF has ever made was offered on this compilation as a whittled-down version. Two bridges were cut out of the song! The bridges were the charming, quirky parts whereupon SF was ""speaking""- once the bridges were edited out, what was left? The version on this album is a disappointing phantom of the original song, and there is absolutely nothing on the album jacket to indicate that the song has been edited.Also, SF's cover version of ""I Only Wanna Be with You"" is inexplicably missing from this compilation.That's it- butcher the most popular song and leave out one of the three major hits she's ever had (other than ""I Wanna Have Some Fun""), and you've got this album.. whatever it is. Save your money."
5,Great Pump - Cheap Price!,Was looking to order a floor pump for my 2nd home and this one met the bill. This pump is extremely cheap compared to many floor pumps and does the job well. Has been very durable thus far (owned for 1+ year) and looks like it will continue to be as well. Recommended
1,"Cheap cheap cheap, DO NOT BUY!","I got this bike pump because it was inexpensive and because I need one for school. However, the entire thing is made of incredibly cheap plastic. The plug itself that fits onto the tire wasn't even made right on mine and the pump didn't even work, it just leaked air! Do yourself a favor and get a better quality pump."
2,Too untraditional for me...,"This isn't what I thought it was going to be. After rereading the description I wouldn't say it isn't accurate but when it says mag ""art"" it really means art. I'm a Journalism Major with an emphasis in magazines. I've started two magazines and published 50 spreads and 3 covers. I didn't feel that anything in this book reflected design that could be used in realistic publications because it wasn't content driven. A lot of the featured spreads had nothing but photographs and a small little caption. If I wanted photography suggestions I would've boughten a photography book.Sadly I wouldn't recommend this book unless you had breezed through it first... That was probably my mistake."
2,Not worth it,The external covering is made of very cheap plastic.I tried to insert a key chain into the end square-loop- which broke with a moderate amount of pressure.I recommend any Kingston 1GB which you can find here for half!
2,Politics or economics?,"The difference between a journalist and a scholar is that a journalist will write a book to mirror the views of his intended audience. This book is journalism, not scholarship. It is very well-written and will tell you what you want to hear. The author has advances an hypothesis as well as an agenda. I found Robert J. Lieber's book The American Era much more dispassionate and realistic."

5,Pro Circuit T-4 Header,Great product. Provides the bottom end your bike needs and the top and mid you want!!!
2,Not the greatest song selection,"This song selection is quite lacking and includes more of the Lets start a war / Horror Epics stuff. Of the later stuff they should have included stuff from ""Jesus is Dead"".Notable tracks that are missing include stuff of Punks not Dead and Troops of Tomorrow. Get those two instead and the Exploited singles collection and you'll have most the good stuff they put out. The Exploited were definitely the best UK punk band of the 80's scene and alot of their stuff kicks ass but not his compilation."
5,"clear, informative, important work.",Maybury-Lewis's newest work is incredibly clear and informative and offers non-anthroplogist and scholars alike a perceptive and important work
5,Fission Fury,Fission Fury is a good book. russian scientists are kidnapped and Bolen must go after them. Little does he know that the scientists are in on their kidnapping at first but soon change their minds. This book has all the adventure and action you could want.
1,"I love this, almost as much as their first one","Not enough Bloomfield guitar, but his keyboard playing fits in well. Butterfield and drummer Sam Lay are on fire, while Elvin and Jerome do a fine job, as usual."
5,Measuring all things,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book..I couldn't put it down! There are many reasons why I found this book very powerful. Mostly , it touches upon many human elements which help define who one is, and in this book the ' who' is John Ferber. Ferber is in many ways an 'every man reaching retirement age yet can't seem to leave the corporate world' - mixed with the drama of personal struggles. Enter life, all the curveballs we are thrown, decisions we must make, and the ethical compromises we succumb to...all these elements are thoughtfully written into the story of New York Measure. It is a story many readers will relate to because in different ways it is a story that we live out each day. I highly recommend this book to those ambitious big city corporates having to redefine their life."
2,My first heart rate monitor,"As a runner I was happy to receive this as a gift. It's great to be able to monitor your heart rate as you exercise. This unit comes with several extras that are really nice -- such as the fitness quotient that calculates your fitness based on age, weight and activity level. It also has a bicycle mount, which is something most don't include. The watch is well-designed -- I get compliments and questions about it -- and the controls are logically arranged and very usable."
5,"ah, what a great watch.","This watch brings back memories. i had one when i was about 14 or 15 (15 years ago). It was the same style as this one and boy i had fun messing with people. One of my favorites was going to Worlds of fun, they have tv's on most rides with their own channel playing endlessly- i would just change the channel- causing no end of hilarity as the staff would be befuddled as to why the tv kept changing to sesame street for some reason! Seems cruel now but watching them pull out the ladder, climb up and manually change it back was awesome back then. (even they didn't have a remote for it!)"
5,Casio Tv remote watch,"Great watch, works with more tvs than listed in manually. You just have to go through the codes to find your tv!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Great toy for Priceless fun,"Alright you kids still in school, don't try this or you might get expelled when caught: i actually had one of these during my last year of high school and up until i got ratted out, me and my classmates had a lot of fun using it to sabotage some of my teacher's lessons (and drove a lot of video-playing substitute teachers into madness! lol). however, when i got busted i was in a heap of trouble... got severely chewed out by the principal with my parents in the room, got suspended, almost got expelled and had to check my watch with the principal everyday after that until graduation. sure was fun though! but the fun didn't end there. but the rest of the fun is another story! and i'm sure you can find your own fun!"
4,Incredible Post Civil War adventure.,History buffs will share excitement for insight that this author offers about Texas and Colorado. My personal knowledge of the region made the read a personal joy. People today will be thrilled by the adventure present in the story. If you are in search of adventure try this read. I am purchasing the sequel. I hope it arrives soon.John Lemaster
4,Six hundred pages--large format--of nothing but numbers,"As the one reviewer said, this tome has limited appeal to the casual observer of the sky. However, it has its uses for the mathematically minded amateur astronomer. It has some detailed trig equations to calculate the movement (proper motion) of individual stars into the future and the past, for instance. You can find the distance of Sirius a million years in the future. There are interesting sections about such things as stellar spectra; their classification schemes, their true brightness as seen by the naked eye. You can find out a lot about your favorite umm, star. Among the 50,000 plus listed, to magnitude 8."
4,Classic Paranoia Theme,A race related murder triggers a black rain. Those that come in contact with the rain go into a murdurous rampage. The book follows the stories of a few groups of people trapped by the rain. How they discover the black rain and how they protect themselves from those inflicted. Stephen King wrote a similar short story.
3,Not bad.,"It isn't as good as her days on Liquid TV where is was practically mindless violence with hardly any words, but there are still a few short skits on this video from then. I found the whole plot of the newer episodes boring and there isn't near enough action. I think that MTV went for a more appropriate animation for the younger audiences as the show progressed. You will definitely be able to tell the difference once you start falling asleep, then being woke up by the sound of gun fire from one of her Liquid Television skits. :)"
5,Not Anime,"This is only a response to the rest of this product's reviews: Aeon Flux is a solidly American cartoon, not anime, and has no connection whatsoever to anime. How anyone could become confused over this is beyond me."
1,I was sold a bootleged copy,"Title says it all. Also, it's only a sampling of the show, and now that the movie is out you can buy all the episodes together in a set."
1,Too many cooks (even if they are good ones) spoil the broth,"This book pulls together a lot of information, but in my opinion it is written and organized very very poorly. I have over 10 yrs of experience in in the healthcare industry and came across this book during a grad level course in CEA.Long, boring, convoluted sentences fill the pages of this book. It took about 3 times more time and effort to get through a page in this book compared to a page in respected journals like JAMA, NEJM, BMJ etc.If you have lots of time and are doing research in this field - go for it. Alternatively if you want to quickly determine what CEA is about, I would recommend reading Peter Muennig and Kamran Khan ""Designing and Conducting Cost-Effectiveness Analyses in Medicine and Health Care""."
4,Very happy,"-I bought 2 of them, and one arrived with the black wrap pulled slightly back from the swiveling connector, revealing the red and green wires inside. Still functions just fine though.-Cable housing is thick and sturdy, not like the cheapo cables. I'm confident they'll last a long time.-The description is a little misleading, I don't see how anyone could actually swivel these all the way to a right angle without putting too much tension on the cable. Still, the ability to swivel even by 45 degrees should be enough to route the cable more conveniently in most situations.-I don't hear any noise coming through these cables, and I'm comparing them against mogami gold. They sound just as good as the gold in my opinion."
2,Big Book of John Deere Tractors,"I was hoping the section on Garden tractors would be covered in depth. Heck, it was hardly covered other than mentioning the models. very disappointing book"
4,It's OK,"Could be better but it's OKFor a bible, missing a few recipes more from every part that is written.I bought used one for 17 usd and that is OK but I see that new one is 174 usd and that is way to much for a this kind of book"
2,NOT FOR HOT WEATHER USE!,"We got this bed to help keep our hot dog cool in the hot desert summer - our pup likes to lounge outside but he just gets so hot! Well, when I opened this package, the instructions said that this bed may not be used where it is over 95 degrees. It didn't say this in the Amazon description, and I think it is important for potential buyers to know this. We're returning it after all because we don't want to risk flooding on our new Pergo floors (other reviewers mentioned this problem), and now we can't even use it outside."
1,Waste of time and Money,"A waste of time and money. Opened it and filled it with 3.25 gallons of water per the instructions. Pressed out the air as instructed and water squirts out the end seam. Glad I caught it before we put it on the floor. Aside from the defective nature of the item we received, it's just cheap junk. The water plug doesn't even lock or screw in place. It would inevitably pop open and flood the floor. The air valve for removing air has no cap at all and it's a 2 way valve. It just pushes into the bed about 1/2 inch. What are the odds that this will not pop out? This immediately went back to Amazon. Save yourself the hassle and find something else. This is garbage."
3,"Water Bed for the dog (70s style), great, but dog doesnt like the movement!","I thought the dog would love this (It's the 70s style water bed, but for the pup (just wait a couple of years and dogs be saying their back hurts)), but the dog does't like the fact that it's swishes around (moves) when she steps on it! Won't go on it at all, and it's too little for me :(PROS: Could keep a dog cool (if they weren't afraid of it)CONS: My dog doesn't like the fact that there's water in it because the water moves and squishes around when she steps on it!"
5,I love it because Jeorge loves it!!,"I bought this bed for my 12 year old golden retriever Jeorge. He is a big guy, has a thick coat and is on meds for his thyroid so he never seems to cool down...until now! It didn't take long for him to understand that this bed was the coolest spot in the house. He sleeps better and cools down alot faster after a hard day at the park. The large holds almost 7 gallons of water, I recommend picking a somewhat permanent spot for it because of the weight."
2,"K&H Cool Bed 3, Large","I purchased this bed for my elderly lab, but, I couldn't get him to use it no matter what I did - I have two other smaller dogs, and I couldn't get them to use the bed either - they'll only lie on it if I sit there beside them - once I get up, they get up - they're not impressed with the bed at all."
4,not too bad,"My dogs use it which makes me happy. It isn't too cold but I think that's b/c the water I used, wasn't cold either (hard to find cold tap water in AZ during the months of July and August.) I will empty it and re-fill it in Oct. when I can get some good cold water in it and see if that makes a difference. I like it though."
4,"Good product. Dog doesn't know it, yet.","Bought this for our hot-natured golden retriever. She is always panting and looking for the coolest spots on our hardwood floors. Thought this would be the perfect bed for her, but she refuses to sleep on it, which is surprising for her as she will sleep on/adapt to anything. Cool bed is currently under her old stuffed bed; I thought, since the cool bed is slightly larger, that as she moved around during the night, she'd wind up on part of the cool bed and get used to it. But she hasn't appeared to fall for this trick, despite my efforts to alter the water amount, making it more or less squishy.I might move it to another room in the house. Definitely not giving up on this - it is a high quality product and feels so cool to the touch - it just blows my mind she hasn't fallen in love with it yet.Might also try it on our shaded patio next summer - while we work in the yard, it would offer her some refuge from the humid heat."
1,poor quality and does not work as advertised,This is just a bag of water without any cooling properties! Also flimsy as my dog chewed the corner off the bed in less than one week. A complete waste of money.
2,Good Grief!,"Yes, the large one I bought 11 months ago weighed a ton with water in it. I used a hose to fill it, and the foam inside clumped up from day one. I wish I had known about the ""broomstick fix"" when I was trying to get air out of it. Ever try to crawl/roll along, on the floor to ... well you get the picture. Mind didn't leak - go figure. I threw it out today. Unfortunately, my two dogs loved the thing. They are sitting at the door waiting for me to bring it back. So ... I'm buying another one with one day shipping. Oh, did I mention that I paid $36.55 for this same item 11 months ago?"
4,good bed...but dog won't use it,"I bought this bed over a month ago for my ten year old, 27 pound Corgi who looked miserably hot and was always panting in the almost 90 degree August and September heat. The bed was easy to fill up, (be sure to put a towel or something to soak up the water that misses the spout). The bed does what it claims, but my dog barely fits lengthwise on the bed so be sure to measure how long your dog is before purchasing.After a month, I've yet to see him lying on the bed. I've tried giving treats, having him lay on the bed while I pet him, and other forms of bribery, yet he would rather sleep on the concrete. It's too bad I can't use the bed..."
1,Bad Purchase,"This is one of those products I wish I hadn't bought. It leaked right away and my dogs were actually afraid of it. I have three dogs and we live in the Southwest, so it was HOT this summer and I couldn't coach one of them to even sit on it. My husband made fun of me for buying it. Just wet your dog down with some water from the hose and save your money..."
3,The dog likes it!,"Recommended by a friend who is a dog breeder. Had expressed concerns over the coming summer months of heat and how my poor old German Shepherd with one functioning kidney was going to fair.Ordered the bed that night and the dog seems to think it's alright. Plops right down on it at bed time!In a perfect world it would be more portable as I travel from point A to B and back to A. Taking the bed is a chore and I have not filled it completely, as instructed, which allows me to at least drag it around the house a bit. Albeit a good price point can't afford to buy 3 more, but...as I said...the dog likes it!"
3,Can't teach an old dog to love a new waterbed.,"I bought this bed for my 12 year old labrador because he has been panting alot and I wanted to make him as comfortable as possible during the hot summer. Try as I might, I could not get him the least bit interested in this bed. I tried with no cover, with a cover, on top of his regular bed. I even coerced him to give it a try with some treats and laid down next to him. I managed to get him to lay on the bed for a brief period - 10 minutes maybe. And then - he left. Never to return again, treats and owner be damned.It seemed like a great idea, but know that it is not for every dog."
4,Great purchase,a friend told me about the cooling bed and it was the best thing I could have purchased for my pet. We had very warm weather and it was perfect for keeping my dog cool.
4,cool bed 3,"I bought this after my dog fell in love with sleeping on a ""people waterbed"" at my mother-in-law's. He didn't take to this at home until I put his old bed on top of it..which has worked out fine. It still has the waterbed feel but now has a more cushy top. Of course it is no longer cool to the touch but for him it works fine."
5,Big help!,I have a Great Pyrenees and she loves this bed! She hangs off of the large size a little bit but it still helps a lot. She laid on it immediately and spent the whole night right there. I would definitely recommend this bed for anyone with a large hairy dog or one that pants a lot. We are using it in the winter too. Glad I found this for her.
3,Great Concept!,"Many people complained about the inner foam slipping when you pick the bed up...well, just grab the corners and that'll never happen. I will say that the documentation could be more demonstrative regarding the lifting/moving process. The bed truly feels cooler and the concept definitely seems to work. My elderly pooch, however, did not like it. I think the squishy feel was part of the problem, but I think his main dislike was the smell. It has a very strong vinyl and aqua (don't know how else to describe that one, it's like you can smell the water) odor. Even after airing for over a month, it still has the strong smell. We're just going to save it for the next family addition, introducing it to a younger dog that isn't so picky!"
5,"Finally, a Cool Dog","I live in Florida and my cocker spaniel is always panting from our extreme heat and humidity. It was very difficult to sleep at night hearing him such apparent distress. Finally, because of the Cool Bed III, we both get good nights' sleep and he is so much more content. Sorry I waited so long ..."
2,smelly waste of money,"I don't know why the picture in the review say coolbed II. They really need to get it together.Anyway, my dog won't come anywhere near this thing, and I understand why. It reeks of plastic and, after several scrubs with soap and water as well as sprays with odor nuetralizers AND the passing of six months, it still reeks of plastic. It is a very unpleasant smell. Theoretically, it would work as described, but my dog nor those of the two neighbors that I know who have bought it will go near it.Good luck!"
2,dog cooling mat,"Great idea except it's got problems. It smells like a swimming pool in your room. It's quite heavy once you put the water in the mat. Worst thing is my dog hated it. She's a 2 year old lab, and she freaked every time she stepped on it. It's like a water bed. I tried it for a week, and she started to refuse to enter her crate. It felt cool to touch, but it doesn't matter if your dog won""t lay on it."
5,cool dog times 2,"Set up is a little bit of a hassle, but simply put, both of my Newfoundlands LOVE their cool bed and that is all I care about!!!!"
3,Not great,"Compared to the more expensive dog cooling bed (dont know if I can mention the brand here), this bed is not as good. You get what you pay for. The material they use is not as cooling and it's very hard to clean. The good thing about the bed is that it's very durable. Bought mine for my dog two or three years ago and I still have it."
4,Cool Bed,"Best bed ever for our bull dog. Cool is the word, he's on there hours at a time. Great product."
5,what took me so long?,"My pups are so very happy! We have had a record HOT summer this year here in Chicago. I bought two: one for inside and one for outside. They love it! They share it! Temps have dropped, so just this morning I emptied both.My little Springer came in the house this afternoon and stood in front of the space where the KoolBed had been, turned her head and looked at me like ""WHERE IS IT?"" With her head low, she walked into the kitchen and lay down on the cool floor under the table."
1,horrific,"I bought this product based on other reviews, of which most said the product worked. Well it doesn't!!! It may be the heat in Northwest Florida however after i put the required amount of water into the mat and waited an hour and placed my hand on it it did not feel cool at all. It was honestly a waste of hard earned money $$$. Take your chance readers, because i know you will. Hopefully it works for you but if you live in a warmer climate good luck! That's the whole reason behind getting it. IT SIMPLY DID NOT DO WHAT IT SAID IT WOULD DO!"
2,works - chemical smell after three months,"It does keep the dogs cool, and worked fine for a few months. However, it has now been three months and it is starting to emanate a very unpleasant chemical smell."
1,useless,I was so looking forward to making a cool place for my elderly dog in the Hawaiian summer heat. She won't go near this thing. It stinks to high heaven. A cheaper alternative is to swap out wet towels all day long. Don't buy it .
2,Not for chewing dogs,"My ten pound, three month old Wheaten Terrier tore the corner off her bed within a few minutes. If there were a frame that could prevent a dog from biting an edge of the mattress, I'd give it another try."
3,Cool Bed III,"Our dog would not rest on it. Even though the temp was high and she is a big lab, she bypassed it for whatever reason. She didn't say."
2,keeping boxer cool in texas,"This is a great idea but becomes too heavy when filled and the cool stuff inside lumps up. The directions are precise but it proved to be impractical. The dog lays on it anyway sometimes, lumps or not."
3,dog cool bed,"Having had several cool beds in the past for my dogs, I am disappointed that my dogs do not like this one. Apparently there is a scent to the vinyl they do not like as they each, all three, have gone over to it, sniffed it and walked away even after having the bed on our patio for several weeks. Any suggestions would be appreciated."
3,Instructions need a warning,"The K&H Cool Bed could have been a great purchase. The lining is tough and it does keep cool when filled with water. But I ended up returning mine because while moving it from outside to inside, most of the gell shifted and bunched up on one side of the bed. Try as I might, I could not get it to distribute evenly again. The instructions should shout this issue in large bold print but it makes no mention of it at all."
3,Works great but doesn't hold up,"My Bully breeds love this bed and it's a real life saver (literally) for dogs that can't cool down. BUT, the bed sprung a leak near the seam where there was a ""wrinkle"". It sounds like this is most peoples complaint. I wonder if you can fix it w/ an old inner tube repair kit,hmm. I'll keep buying them because for the price they WORK. TIP: don't buy the covers. They are made of REALLY cheap fabric and are poorly made-use an old pillowcase instead."
1,Living room flood!,"Really, 4 stars for the product & 1 star for me! What WAS I thinking! The bed filled with water easily & was amazingly cool to lay on. I even considered sleeping on it!! My dog loved it! He loved it so much that he chewed a small hole that converted my living room into a swimming pool @ 4am, no less! So.... Great product NOT for 8 mth old previously well behaved, ""thought you'd stopped chewing"" puppies! LOL! If there is ANY chance your dog will chew, don't do it! Otherwise it is an awesome cool bed!"
5,This really works!,"This is not a gimmick! This bed really does the trick! We don't have AC, and the heat of the summer has really been relentless this year. Our pup used to pant and move from spot to spot on the tile floor, always restless. Now---he goes straight to this cooling bed and has wonderful, restful, cool naps. Easy to use and nice to throw a leg or your own head on it, too when you can't catch a break. 100% recommend!!!"
2,Cool but will not use,My australian cattledog has an illness which makes it difficult to regulate her body temp. She prefers to lay on the floor of the shower - I thought by getting this bed that she would spend more time with me. She refuses to lay on. I have tried all kinds of things to get her to lay on it but as soon as that water moves or makes any kind of noise - off she goes. The same goes for my other two. They refuse to use it. They snatch the treat and off they go to some other area. It's been a futile effort.
4,Looks pretty durable,I just bought it but it looks pretty durable and it is very good when you fill it up with water. So far I like it.
2,Cannot recomend to anybody else,"I received this cool bed III two weeks ago, it is already broken (water leak)"
1,"Nice Idea, Doesn't Work","Seems like a good idea, especially with the temperatures this summer. Unfortunately, this product just doesn't work. Doesn't stay cool and it's just a durable plastic with a foam core, there is nothing separating the water from the foam. You can't get the water out tolet this pad dry, hence the inside becomes moldy, and you can't replace all the water to get it cool again. Just doesn't work."
2,My Dog ate the corner spilling Water everywhere!,"Didn't even make it 24 hours before my dog ate the corner of this bed and made it leak out everywhere. I'm very bummed, because he is a Bernese Mountain Dog in Texas and gets very hot. I had high hopes, and I'm still going to see if I can patch it. SO, if you have a chewer I wouldn't buy this bed."
5,K & H 1720 Large Cool Bed III,"I wasn't sure if my long haired Hybrid Wolf/Husky would use this bed but living in Florida he was always warm, even in the A.C. I filled with it water just enough so I could still pull it around to move it, thinking I could always put more into it. I also wanted to make sure he wasn't going to chew on it because he was still teething when we got it. For the first couple of days, he didn't really pay much attention to it. Then I laid down one day and I couldn't believe how cool it got while I was laying there. Anyways, after laying there a few minutes he came over and laid with me. Well, that's all it took! He LOVES his cool bed so much that he it on it 90% of the time he is in doors. I am so-o-o-o-o happy I found a product like this. THANK YOU SO MUCH K & H for making this and for making my pup a happy one!."
3,no great shakes (not cool),"Purchased three for my gang of 5 (the eldest being 14). Have made two available to them. The old gal uses it only because it's in her customary place, but I don't see where she's any cooler. I would imagine she gets some relief from pressure through the waterbed effect, although the intent was to make her cooler in the heat. Other bed is pretty much avoided by most of the dogs even though it's in a 'usual' bedding place. I did cover them with lightweight sheets to keep them clean - maybe that's the difference?? Don't know, but I'll likely be sending the third back, unopened. Have used the ones that remain damp in the past - they hated those so I though maybe this would work. Oh well, back to the drawing board!Shipping was, as always, prompt and accurate!"
4,My dogs are nearly always on the bed.,"My old Irish Setter girl loves the bed, Its great in the hot weather we're having just now.The only disadvantage with this bed is because of the weight it cant be shifted."
2,Not Good Long Term,After a some time it began to leak. It was a pour but a gradual and persistent leak that left the underside perpetually wet. Luckily I kept the bed in a large kennel pan. It's also difficult to move when full and hard to keep clean.
1,k and h cool bed 3,not very cool and extremely heavy and cumbersome...disappointed with the product...I was hoping this product would cool the dog on hot days but this was not the case...
4,Works!,"This product works very well as far as cooling is concerned. My German Sheperd who loves the cold, actually gets too cold after a while and moves to lay on the rug. I was surprised when I sat on it myself. As seconds pass by, it feels cooler and cooler. The difficult part was the initial setup : 1) fillling it with water and then 2) transporting it to our bedroom as it was very heavy to move. Nothing my husband could not handle though. When trying to fill it with water, there is no splash free way. This is a mechanism that I would recommend to the manufacturer to improve on. Also, the exact amount of the water is hard to measure. It will be more like an approximation. You will need to have a towel around to dry the excess water. All and all I like it and is one the best cooling devices for my dog other than the full blast AC, living in Florida."
1,Not satisfied,"Not happy with the K&H Cool Bed. Does not stay as ""cool"" as it should. Not happy with vendor. Wrote and told vendor that I was displeased and they offered for me to return it. Yet....when I wrote back for instructions as to how to return the product, I haven't heard from them. I won't by from them again and I totally wasted my money. Should have bought from Petsmart (like I started to), spent the extra money and then could have had a friendly - no questions asked (or comments) return."
1,Very disappointed,"I received the bed tonight for my old dog who has been sleeping outside to keep herself cool. Couldn't wait for the bed. It arrived in pieces. Either Amazon or K&H apparently tried to ship it without putting it in another box. The manufacturer's box was first used, everything got damaged then the ripped up damaged contents were put into another box and sent to me. The bed smelled, had grease stains all over. The instructions were torn up. A call to customer service netted nothing. Now 2 days before Christmas I have to bundle all of the garbage Amazon sent me, bring it to a UPS center then wait for Amazon to receive the package and up to another 2 weeks to process, the rep told me before I'll be issued a refund. I can't comment on the bed itself, other than the bad odor that accompanied it since it arrived damaged but do yourself a favor and don't order it through Amazon. Customer Service was useless."
1,Cool if you can easily carry 50 lbs around!,A gallon of water weighs approx 8.33 lbs. 6 gallons = just a stich under 50 lbs. The dogs sleep upstairs and the water supplyis downstairs. I can not beleive other people don't have a problem with this. especially if you have to keep changing the water.
1,Waste of money....,"I bought this for my Siberian Husky who tore it to shreds in less than five minutes. It is deemed ""durable""... of which it is NOT. I wasted close to $40 on this junk. I don't recommend it, especially if you have a Siberian Husky."
3,Not cool enough!!,I have a prissy pomeranian who won't sit still long enough to lie on it i've tried everything so i can't tell you if it's the bed or if its her.
1,A fail-safe way to sell a book,"I was very disappointed with the contents in this book. After a cursory reading my first impulse was to throw it into the trash. However, out ofrepect for God and the Holy Spirit I declined. The book is poorly written,redundant to a fault, and very rudimentary. It does not belong in a library of serious religious study. It does not challenge the reader nor engage the reader's mind. It's much too simple. It does not reflect the fruit of the spirit. Alas we cannot spin scripture to support our belief. Nor should we interject thoughts as biblical truths which are not scriptually based. ""And if you receive the forgiveness of sin, then you will also recieve the Holy Spirit."" This is not sound doctrine."
3,a failsafe way for you to receive the holy spirit,well written and informative . recomend to anyone requiring a straightforward approach to this complex subject.
4,Nice book to share your passion with your siblings,Nice book to share your passion with your siblings or with anyone who happens to be interesting in an introduction to the sport
5,The bset primer available.,"I got my first copy in approximately 1979 and have gotten copies for my daughters since. Anderson presents essential information in a well though out, logical, and entertaining fashion. A must-read for anyone getting into fly fishing, as well as a good refresher for those with some experience. Contrary to what some would have you believe, fly fishing can be a simple and straight-forward sport; this book makes that clear."
5,The best book on the topic,"I live in Bishop, CA which is a flyfishers paradise. This book made flyfishing simple, easy to understand and is the best single work on the topic ever written. I say that while adimiting that I was a friend of the late, great Sheridan Mullholland Andreas Anderson and I miss him. Don't miss this book. I have just ordered a copy for a flyfisher beginer."
3,Try another,"I am a newbie at the sport and bought this after seeing it highly recommended on several group discussions. But I was disappointed. The book is very short. It is written in comic book style. I don't have a problem with this, but I thought it was limiting.Unless you are a extreme newbie, I can't recommend it. And if you are, go with LL Bean's book by Dave Whitlock."
3,Full of Metaphors,This one is my least favorite Jodorowsky film but it still has much to say. It has much in common with his others and his themes are always the same but this one is more abstract that the others to the end and the viewer would really only understand after watching the films once and then again with the Director commentary.
5,A Comprehensive and Readable Book on Cancer,"I received a an earlier edition of this book in 1991 when I was diagnosed with colon cancer and found that the information on cancer was presented in such a way that most people could understand. Since that time, whenever I hear of someone having cancer, I buy a copy of the book and give it to them. The book is very comprehensive and besides covering all the different sites for cancer as well as treatment, it is well illustrated and has many references."
1,Should have been cleared from the shelves 1-1/2 stars,"I read this book expecting some fun, light reading. It was anything but fun. For me it did not have much substance. I never bonded with any of the characters. Rachel's parents were selfish, Rachel was spineless and Dan? I don't know. He was in the periphery so I never really got to know him. I could see an effort in trying to make it funny, but it was not for me. At the end, as she gave explicit details of the wedding via a wedding video, I found myself skipping through the paragraphs. Also there were too many Jewish references, none of which I knew anything about. I could not relate to any of the characters. Not even a smile formed on my lips through this book. Glad it's over. If you really want to read a laugh out loud fun book, try Dating Without Novacaine or The Bachelorette Party."
2,Very Hard to Get Through,"I found this book to be very hard to get through. It was very slow and sort of boring. I really didn't understand all of the complaining and fighting in the book. I just wished there would have been a better plot than the bride just voicing her views. I'm planning my own wedding, it is nothing like the book. Also, since the bride and groom were Jewish, and I'm not, I needed a glossary or dictionary just to understand what was going on. I struggled to finish the book and was very disappointed. I really didn't feel that my time was well spent on reading this book.I would recommend I Do (But I Don't) By Cara Lockwood if you want a good wedding book!"
3,Good at first,"I related with this book because I had a lot of family issues and problems during my wedding planning. It is a good book but I have two complaints. First, too many Jewish words or traditions not defined. At first, I googled but there are a lot and got tired of googling. Second, the ending takes FOREVER! 30 pages of her outlining the actual ceremony and reception. Take out some the Jewish words and cut the ending by half - then it I would say it was a great book!"
2,Huge Build-Up to a Giant Let-Down,"Rachel and David are getting married. Seems simple enough, but first they have to overcome her cheap father, obnoxious stepmother, melodramatic mother, his 1950's thinking parents, unenthusiastic friends , meddling relatives and then find their own meaning in a Jewish ceremony. Rachel eventually pulls off a wonderful event, full of personal touches and special acknowledgments to family and friends. She also grows closer to David and learns to accept all her family (and in-laws) for who they are.I read this while planning my own wedding and thought it very fitting. I was relieved to know that things could be worse - at least I didn't have any parent problems or the issue of kosher versus non-kosher or kosher-style. I think the book drifted off near the end with the author's need to tie everything up in a neat bow of an ending. The last part is a detail of the wedding video, given very short-shrift in comparison to the actual event."
5,Almost too witty for the genre,"I love chick lit and I can't resist books about weddings, so when I saw this in a bookstore I thought I'd give the new author a chance. I'm glad I did -- the characters are well-drawn, the author has a great tone. Overall, the book is exactly what it's intended to do: keeps you guessing, keeps you entertained, and keeps you wanting more. Can't wait for a second book."
4,"Weird, but Interesting","I was able to read this book by buying the British edition. I didn't get a lot of the Britspeak , but the story made up for that.Robert Hunt is a teen confused about his true identity. This book brings up some good points, especially for people confused or curious about who truly they are. It also brings up some interesting philosophical points. During a class discussion on Shakespeare, they talk about gender stereotypes and how boys would dress up to play girls roles in classical theatre. The story moves on to deal with Robert discovering his feminine side and his friend coming out about his sexuality - both topics not usually discussed in YA lit. I think the book handled them well.I found this book too short. It wasn't perfect, but it was still a fairly good (albeit an easy) read."
1,This is not endorsed by search and rescue practitioners,These terms are not common for inland search. The authors took some poetic licensing to try to convince searchers that land search and water search are equal in tactics and detection. Save your money.
5,magnifiscent,"I can't get enough of this music. I'm listening to the album every other day, sometimes several times a day, since I got it 4 months ago. I am fond of all the pieces but especially no 2 and 7 (tecum pricipio, has a harp accompaniment). There are parts that are quite simple ( such as just an organ or a harp accompanying a single voice) alternating with parts that are more intense ( many instruments and voices). I don't find it ever overwhelming (I don't like shouting choirs). The whole is extremely melocic. And the recording is superb with the most beautiful male and female voices you could dream of. Music that makes my soul rejoice. But then, I am partial, I love Saint Saens, a lot of what he composed. This and the cello compositions are my favorite."
4,Revisit the Matrix,"The title says it all: ""A Beginner's Guide to Reality"". The author uses three perspectives to look at what we consider objective reality through several different lenses. His three parts, in which he views the world as social, philosophical, and physical are a nice introduction to the world as we feel it, think about it, and actually experience it. This is an introduction, and a good one, with one caveat. I had hoped that the section on quantum physics would be a bit more accessible, and the use of math was a turnoff for me. Many writers have approached quantum physics in a lively and entertaining way, and I thought he fell short in that respect. However, I must say that the Epilogue more than made up for that shortcoming: a nice summary, pulling all the threads together."
4,HS Science teacher's point of view - Not as difficult to read as one might assume...,"The author does a wonderful job of incorporating current fictional works (that most people should be familiar with) to make his ideas and thoughts extremely accessable. If you like thinking deep thought or even deluding yourself that you are thinking deep thoughts , this book will be an engaging and enjoyable read."
2,DON'T BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I got this a little after I got Pokemon Leaf Green and it did not have enough information! It only covers the first three islands (and Kanto of course).It didn't show the Pokemons'Egg Moves or stats.It doesn't show too many tips at the beginning section of the book(even though the games' in-game Help section makes up for that).It doesn't show where too find any items at the end. I have found items in the game that the guide doesn't show on its maps. At least it shows Gym Leader/Legendary Pokemon strategies and quick ways to get through cetain areas (Team Rockets Hideout for example).PROS:Good Maps.Good Strategies.Shows most visible items and some invisible items.Shows some useful tips.Almost decent Pokedex.CONS:Doesn't show enough tips.Doesn't have a complete PokedexDoesn't show every area (like it claims)Doesn't show all items.Doesn't show nature's or egg groups.Get a different guide (NOT THIS ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!)
1,the wrong guide,"So there I was, walking out of the bookstore with the Prima Guide to my Pok'emon FireRed game. Little did I know that there was not enough contents to help me with the game. When I had to fight Pok'emon Trainers, and also Gym Trainers, the book didn't give enough details for the battles, like what pok'emon types my enemies have, like poison, or rock. I WAS FRUSTRATED. Even though I did get my pok'emon experience points properly to level up, the battles were still hard. Also, I needed to know how much health my pok'emon get after using certain healing items, like super potions. Yes, I went back to the bookstore to ask for the Nintendo Power Guide, but they didn't have it. Can't find it anywhere else but online."
1,Booooo!!!,"I have used Prima books for years and except for Verses Bookswhich went out of business, they WERE the best.But now.... I cannot believe how bad this book is, it seems that the writers of this book did not even play the game.I will think twice about buying any Prima product in the future.It used to be that the Nintendo guides were only so-so, butNintendo seems to have learned what Prima forgot.Write a decent guide and you will sell more books & games.If you get any guide make it the one from Nintendo."
2,"Nintendo Power Better, but get both","This is a terrible book, but the ""Cheat Sheats"" help in this one. You should get Nintendo Power for after the Elite Four, because this book does not have any info about those events. Overall, Nintendo Power is the better of the 2."
1,Pokemon Fire Red & Leaf Green (Prima Official Game Guide),"the guide is full of typos and misinformation. the pokedex in the back is very weak. it shows no stats for any pokemon. it only has what moves they learn (of which many of them are typos) it also doesn't have what a nature does to a pokemon. (in other words, it doesn't tell what stat a nature hurts and helps) it also is missing a list of all the moves in the game. it only has the 50 TMs, but the other moves (non TM and HM) are not in the book. i have to use 2 other guides to make up for this. the only use for this guide is to find items, however, it's not worth it since there is no other information what-so-ever."
2,NOT very good,One of the worst guides! my mom suggested to buy this one but it was not good at all and neither of us knew it. They should've added the R/S pokemon in it but they didn't! >:( they didn't give information on the other 4 islands either. but the pokemon areas were good I guess...
3,Bleh :(,"It's not /as/ bad as some say it is. But is has lots of flaws. Th guide to Rock Tunnel was bad, I was lost for /hours/. ACK! >< But the Pokedex is quite good.It doesn' tell where to get Flash but supposes you have it. (You go through Diglett's cave and down to the big blue house thing where an aide is aiting.) Get a different one."
2,50% accurate,"Was pleased with the promptness of delivery. The pages were clean as stated. However, the beginning half of the book's pages were detached from the binding.Misled into thinking the product was in better shape. disappointed!"
2,Not good!!!!,"this thing is terrible!!!! it tells nothing about the other sevii islands and does not tell about deoxys. buy the nintendo power guide. i think primagames just rushed and did not care about what they made. worst of all. it is just like the guide for pokemon RED ""& Blue!!!!!"
1,Worst Guide Ever,This was a terrible excuse for a guide. The book was poorly constructed and a great deal of its information was wrong. I hope that in the future they devote more time to editing the guides before putting them out. Next time I intend to buy Nintendo Power.
1,Pokemon Fire Red & Leaf Green : Prima Official Game Guide,"Worst Strategy guide ever!!!!!!!!!!You would expect Prima to release the guide in the same format as R/S. Which was pretty F***ing amazing.Well, I guess that's what happens when people get lazy. Thank you very F****ing much Prima. I'll never buy a prima guide ever again. Maybe."
3,Light Entertainment,"""Unraveled"" is a pleasant romance novel set in a space-faring future. T is a young lady who has been raised in isolation at a scientific community. Eager to complete a research project, T leaves the research center and hires R, a ship's pilot, to engage in a fast paced whirlwind tour of planets to prove her theory. T is naive and white collar; R worldly and blue collar. R despises scientists in general and T in particular, but finds her irresistable and enchanting.The personalities and attraction were well portrayed. The action was fun and fast paced. This novel was more Romance than SciFi, though there were certainly elements of both. There is an author's message that its okay for individuals to make a modest profit, but horridly immoral for companies to make a profit. This is annoying but only overplayed in the Epilog, which I recommend you skip.This wasn't ""keep forever & re-read"" material, but it was entertaining and fun. Perfect for a lazy afternoon."
3,A bit repetitive...,"Although I am of the ""health, not size matters"" mindset, I had a hard time getting through this book.Several times throughout the first chapter, many pages apart, she'd introduce Twiggy as if it were the first time she ever spoke about it. While the role Twiggy's past popularity played in the way society now views fat people is noteworthy, the way Ms Poulton conveyed it was less than impressive.It appears her choppy writing style spread to other topics through most chapters. With each chapter I read, I'd be thinking ""Didn't I read this exact same phrase earlier?""It is unfortunate because she has a very important message to send to the general public about size acceptance.I am giving this three stars because despite the poor editing job, the topic is a must-read."
3,Ms. Poulton provides a lot of excellent information,"I appreciated the wealth of information contained in this well-researched book. I learned a great deal about the diet industry, and agree with Ms. Poulton that we are tricked into spending our money on something that isn't attainable. However, as one who suffers with super morbid obesity, I have never experienced the kind of discrimination that Ms. Poulton describes. I have certainly experienced discrimination throughout my life, but never the amount in a single day, as described by Ms. Poulton. She came across as angry and at times, vindictive. Those parts of the book turned me off. Otherwise, it was very informative, and enlightening."
4,An excellent writer with a mixed message,"I must commend the author for her excellent writing. What a joy it is to read something by someone who knows how to write. The message however seemed mixed and somewhat confused. I was not at all sure just what the author was saying (or trying to say?). It seems impossible to me that after a lifetime of yo-yo eating one could find what the author describes as one's 'normal appetite'. I agreed with much of her statements, but in the end, I felt her general concluding remarks did not really make sense. Just what is the author looking for? To be thin? To be thin enough? To diet? Not to diet? For many people, to stay thin (or thin enough for them) a 'normal appetite' is a diet. Unfortunate....but true. I still loved the book. It was a great read by a very good writer."
2,Works .. But ..,"I ordered this item because it looked just like the original unit I had installed 15 years earlier that had just failed and it was one of a matching set for our two sinks.When the new faucet arrived it looked a little flimsier than the one being swapped out. But so what I thought, it was a good price so I proceeded to unpack and install.My biggest complaint was the faucet bottom .. it didn't sit flat on the sink. Everything worked just fine but the gap left between the faucet and the sink top looked bad and required a lot of caulk. This of course added to the cheap look of the final product.My conclusion is that while this item works fine; I would willingly have spent more to get something that looks better installaled."
3,"faucet ok, but a little cheap","faucet fits and works ok, but the drain parts are all plastic. Also, no gasket was provided for mounting like other Moen faucets that I bought. It looks and works good though."
1,This book blows chunks,"I feel personally abused after trying to use this book to program in autocad. I have learned many programming languages and this book is the worst one I have ever encountered. It does not--I reapeat does not--start with the standard explanation of how to print ""hello world"" and move on from there as all programming books should do. Just trying to figure out how to display the value of my variables as a simple program is running had me pulling out my hair. I could go on but I won't."
1,Too small even for just one parakeet!,"This cage is too small for even one finch. Please do research and choose at least the minimum recommended cage size for your bird. This cage is too small for finches, parakeets and canaries! Using this cage would be considered animal abuse!"
3,Price great however dye transferable,I like the fact the price was great. And thought yellow would be great for my bird. However the yellow kept rubbing off. It took at least 4 times of washing to safely allow my bird to use it.
4,Bird Cage Arch Style,This is a small cage. Looks good a bit flimsy. Would not use for long term. Still it's a nice little cage for the price and my uses.
2,not that good,this is too small for even a small bird and falls apart easily. i do not recommend this cage.
4,A Good Start,"This book is a good start for beginners at the game. It could have used some editing to eliminate the typos and garbled strings of play. Some of the annotated games and puzzles leave one a little short as to why the game or puzzle is now won or solved. At least we learned about bridges, ladders, templates, etc., so it's worth having."
4,Looney Tunes review-1,"Good. Clear and sound. Very well edited. What ever this type of cartoons I want to be in my collection, most of them available in this volume. I purchased both, volume-1&2. May be amazon will release other volumes very soon.Liyakkathali Mooppan"
4,Enjoyable to watch,"Standard collection of great classic hits. Will be adding more to our collection. Nice packaging & good price. No problem with any of the CD's. Only draw back is we picked the free super saver shipping & it took close to 3 wks. to receive. When it finally came it was shipped UPS 2 day air, but we weren't billed for the additional shipping so who cares. My only suggestion is order in plenty of time if needed by a certain date unless you pay for another shipping method. Overall good pick & service. Would recommend to anyone."
5,Great Product!,"I recently had a little boy and I wanted to buy some good cartoons that I knew would be of quality. So I ordered this set, and I think I enjoy them more than he does! Shipping was fast, great quality. Love it."
4,Excellent,I love the Looney Tunes when I was a kid and I still love them!! It brought back so many memories of watching these w/ my brothers!
3,half-way decent tunes collection,"My husband & I were nursed on Looney Tunes growing up in the 60's & 70's. We use one-liners from Buggs hourly, or as needed. This collection is a good start for a personal library. It has some of the classics that are undeniable. But like many greatest hits albums... It's not truely divitive. Especially for the price. The discription on Amazon didn't offer enough info about which episodes are in each volume. Maybe I could've chosen a better set."
4,"I haven't viewed it yet, but...","I'll tell you, there has been a lot of people complaining that they will release the really good episodes on another DVD set sometime as a ploy to make us buy two sets. You know what? LET THEM. I will buy it just as I am going to buy this set. Who doesn't want all the ""ok"" ones anyway. Looney Tunes are the best cartoons that were ever drawn. They are intelligent and worth anyone's time to see even the ""ok"" ones."
3,All that glitters isn't golden,"A good collection but hardly Golden. The transfer is ok (compared with normal tv broadcast) but not great. The collection has some stars but also some duds. The omission of ""What's opera doc"" probably the most famous Bugs cartoon makes a joke out of calling the Disc the ""Best Of"". Obviously Warner intends to soak us for all they can by issuing mediocre toons in with the best. If I had paid more attention to the title lists instead of the hype I would not have bought it without the deal I got."
2,Scratched DVD,Ordered this for my kids for Christmas but one of the disks is scratched and we didn't figure it out until weeks later when watching this particular disk for the first time. You can clearly see the scratch and it came that way. So bummed b/c just missed the return window!!! Ugh!
5,Wonderful Collection,If you can't get enough of Bugs Bunny then this is a must have for you. This is a great collection of cartoons we all grew up watching and at a very affordable price!
4,Nearly Perfect!,"I love the DVD. While I'm bummed a few of my favorites are here, I realize that they can't include everything in the first collection. I would have given it 5 starts, but the volume on the DVDs seems low. I have to turn up the TV much more than normal. Other than that, this is a must-have for any Looney Tunes fan."
3,Looney Tunes,"If you enjoyed these as a kid, they're fun to watch again. Our kids are enjoying them for the first time, however they are lacking in the Roadrunner, Wiley Cayote shows and too many consist of Tweetie and Sylvester."
4,Lots of Funny / Not a Lotta Money,"Excellent quality, color was beautiful, etc. Brought back memories of Sunday morning on my tummy in front of the old B&W. Also provided some therapeutic laughter. Money well spent."
4,Old School Toons,"This is exactly the video I had hoped it would be. I have been looking for ""The Rabbit of Seville"" and was happy to find this collection of old school Loony Toons with all the violence and hilarity I remember from my childhood!"
5,EXCELLENT JOB!,"I don't think they could have made Golden Collection (6 sets: 1-6) any better!PLEASE come out with more as a good sized collector's sets! there are 1,001 cartoons from 1929-1969 & we need to have this preserved & out for us to enjoy!"
4,Great fun at any age,I purchased the Looney Tunes-Golden Collection for my husbands birthday present. Among all the other gifts he received this was the one he has enjoyed to most. I love to listen to him laugh over and over again. By the end of the night we were all sitting in the TV room having a great time remembering these great cartoons.
5,People Please RELAX,"I happen to work at Warner Bros.DVD authoring facility and have been working on these DVD's for quite some time now.Do you really think Warner would release all the classics and all the Oscar winners in the first collection. Get real. If all the best ones were all in one collection, there would be no need for more boxsets in the future. Trust me the others are on the way.they take time and effort to restore the prints. I guess you could call WB greedy, but from a marketing standpoint it makes sense to spread them out.By the way, there were over 1000 'looney tunes' and 'merrie melodies' created. At aprox 56 cartoons per set, it would take almost 20 box sets to release them all. (ain't gonna happen)my guess (and it means more job security for me) is that Warner will release 1 or 2 collections per year if the consumer response is good. So please buy them. It's worth it."
3,looney tunes volume one,"very good quality on sound and video the material is uncut and uncensoredas it was originally produced. i like the option for a ""play all"" as with most dvd players will resume from last point if you shut it off before the dvd is done. only gripe i have is where is the episode of ""what! no gravy!""hopefully they may include that and many others in future releases."
5,This is the one to buy,"Twice as many cartoons as the Premier Collection, plus tons of extras! The choice is obvious: (...)"
5,Perfect,Everything was great with this product it was exactly what I was looking for plus it was shipped in a timely manor. Thanks for everything.
4,"Good Collection, but incomplete, to say the least","Any Looney Toons collection that does not include ""What's Opera Doc"" and ""Ali Baba Bunny"" is not complete so it cannot recieve a five-star rating. It does have some of my favorites: ""Rabbit of Seville,"" ""Bully for Bugs,"" ""Duck Dodgers in the 24 1/2 Century,"" and ""Drip Along Daffy."" For those of us who still have Laserdisc format, Warner Brothers released a total of 12 specialty laser discs containing Looney Toons. Each laser disc had 14-16 cartoons on them. WB also released on Laser disc five ""Golden Age of Looney Toons"" collections, including a lot of the ""banned"" cartoons. If you can, check them out. They sell on eBay occasionally."
4,Warners little excuse,"A quote from Dorinda Marticorena, WHV's director of children's marketing, in a recent CNN article is erroneous. Warnersays that the extended releases are due to the long amount ofrestoration time involved She says ""it's as fast as they can clean up the originals.""I watch many of these same cartoons on Boomerang or Cartoonnetwork channels and they appear to be restored. At least tothe level needed that DVD can support. I counter Warnersargument and say that most, if not all, of the popularcartoons have already been restored. It is a classicmarketing ploy to string out and gain interest in thedisc set that has been proven to work for those wanting tobe ""collectors"".That being said, I am happy they are releasing these. Idon't want to count on a broadcast company to see thesefor years down the road."
3,Wile E. Coyote?,"The first thing I looked for when I logged on to see this DVD was What's Opera, Doc? As other reviewers have written, it's not there. My next search was for Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner and it looks that they are not on this either. Guess I'll have to wait for Golden Collection II."
3,Are They Complete?,Are these the ENTIRE shorts or are they edited down versions like those being shown on TV? The ones on The Cartoon Network have been edited down from the original versions and things are missing. What is the status of these shorts?
3,What once was magical,"When some of us first saw these cartoons they were available only as a special treat before the feature film. In the 50's and 60's they came one at a time. The temptation to watch several at once when they are presented under one cover can lead to disappointment.The individual episodes are as great as ever, but try to avoid watching more than one or two at a time."
3,"Not ""The Greatest""","I snatched this DVD up as soon as I saw it and while the cartoons on the 4 disc collection are among the best, they left out some true classics that exclude it from being THE best. How can ""What's Opera Doc' (possibly the greatest animated short ever) be left off the inaugural collection. Missing also was ""Robin Hood Daffy"" and some truly great Roadrunner shorts. instead there were some shorts that left a lot to be desired, such as ""Porky Chops"".I realize WB needs to hold onto some of the Greats as bait for their next collection but this ""Golden Collection"" was at least slightly tarnished. Perhaps WB should have produced their colelctions instead by era."
4,Thank god for DVD's,"When did Bugs Bunny become Politically incorrect? You can not find these cartoons on any channel, not even the cartoon channel. I have fond remories of waking up on Saturday morning grabing my favorite ceral and being glued to the Looney Toons bunch. Todays children never even heard of Bugs Bunny because someone became ""Offended"" over a cartoon, People, wake up, its just a cartoon, When did America lose the ability to laugh at it self? These DVDS are great and I hope one day Warner Brothers put every cartoon made on DVD for us to charish."
5,looney over this collection,"i,like most people my age grew up watching these timeless bits of insane, inspired madness that was looney tunes.what we have here is the first of many(i hope) sets with all our old friends. this is a great way to spend time with your kids watching these timeless tales. my boys love them and so do i.so go on and get it,you can claim it's for your kids but you know it's for you also. enjoy and th tht th th thas all folks."
5,Love the Looney Tunes,"Excellent box set that brings back my childhood memories. Still love it,and trying to show my kids what real animation is like."
4,"I hope you re-a-lize, this means MORE!","Ok, ok, Warners didn't release all the cream of the crop on the first DVD collection. Just as well - a large portion of the country could be hospitalized if allowed to watch that many cartoons at one time.Yes, I love ""What's Opera Doc?"" and ""A Froggy Evening"" but I can run them in my mind's eye without effort (except for chortling, of course). I'm delighted they are scouring for some less well-known but equally clever shorts by Avery, Jones et al.These are, in an era where the term has become cliched, truly a joy for all generations. My 85-year old mother enjoys them as much as my 9-year old son.And the list of missing cartoons guarantees we've all got something to look forward to next Christmas, too!!Hossenpfeffer!"
2,This is a stop gap release.,"Why does WB's marketing department think that a Best of needs releasing before investing in series releases?They pulled this same stunt with Friends.Fox, universal, Sony, Disney, A/E, Bravo, HBO and others have had NO remorse in selling season box sets of their series. Only WB thinks that they need to ""test"" the waters with EVERY big box set they make.What is needed here is a CHRONOLOGICAL release of the shorts.Do that. Please.I would have rather never had these shorts be released than to deal with this garbage. I hope it sells well enough to justify a full release on DVD of everything.WB did this same junk with TOM and JERRY back in 1999, and there's NOTHING here yet. I had to go buy compilations from JAPAN to get T&J.; Why????Buy it if you have kids and you want them to see good cartoons.If you're an animation fan/collector, hold off... Don't be fooled that this is what you need.And We need some TEX AVERY TOO!!!!!"
2,"It's okay, but not that great","This is a very good disk for kids. It has some bonus material for adults too, but honestly, it doesn't have the best episodes that I expected to see.my 2 cents"
2,get serious,"no black and white, no wartime, no great piggy bank robbery, no historical organization. a scattershot collection omitting many crucial cartoons. when will warners realize the value of what they have and start issuing it in a way that makes sense for collectors and fans alike."
3,"Poor Transfer, No Logic to Selection","I was excited by this release--I've been waiting for Looney Toons on DVD for years! But the DVD transfer is ATROCIOUS! It looks like they ran the films through Kleenex! Dust and fibers are all over the cartoons, and it is VERY distracting! The idea of collections like this is to have the film as nearly ""good as new"" as possible! I hope they fix this problem before any more releases. Also, I found the selections have no rhyme or reason--I would have preferred releases by character or director, as they did on video about 12 years ago. This is just a mish-mash--you really don't know what you're getting."
2,Dust Artifacts Distracting,"I love Warner Bros. cartoons, but many of these are marred by dust artifacts in the background. The images themselves are sharp and well defined when played on a Blu-Ray player and I assume the same is true on a standard DVD player. The artifacts, however, are inexcusable and they're distracting. But they're the only game in town."
4,"Well worth owning, but...","First, let me say that I really do like this collection. The documentary featurettes are interesting and enjoyable. The cartoons themselves are glorious. But, like so many others, I'm mystified by Warner Brothers' choice of content. The omissions are as egregious as the inclusions are warranted. How can you pretend to a definitive Bugs Bunny collection without ""Knighty Knight, Bugs,"" which, after all, made him that Oscar-winning rabbit? How could you omit ""Robin Hood Daffy"" from the Daffy/Porky canon? Why leave out one third of the ""Rabbit Fire/Rabbit Seasoning/Duck, Rabbit, Duck"" trilogy? What a maroon!Obviously, if you're a fan of the old Warner cartoons, there is much here to treasure and enjoy. I only hope the marvelous works left out of this collection will soon find their rightful place on DVD in a subsequent release."
5,A Great Buy,"This collection is a must have for DVD Collectors and Lonney Tunes Fans because it has the best cartoons of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and the whole Looney Tunes Gang..."
4,Great,"I love these old bugs bunny cartoon's, the only thing was they had a lot of dust showing on the video from the original films."
5,"Finally, Lonney Tunes on DVD","I use to to see Lonney Tunes on VHS tapes. The bad thing about them is that they cut the cartoons. The best thing about this DVD is that the cartoons are uncut. The features are very cool, especially Toons Head: The Lost Cartoons"
4,This Collection Is Golden,This is a masterpiece of looney tunes cartoons. I've especially love the Daffy Duck series since. He's my favorite. Also the behind scenes footage is awesome. My only disappointment is I didn't see enough Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam. I hope another collection of Looney Tunes cartoons come out soon.
4,A good collection of Looney Tunes.,"I love these collections. I enjoy watching them with my children (8 and 11). They are timeless. The collections tend to have several classics and a few filler features. I would like to get one comprehensive collection, rather than many piecemeal collections."
4,Looney for Looney Tunes,Great DVD package with some classic favorites. Reminds me of my youth. Pick it up to see how REAL cartoons are done. Truly timeless and still funny after all of these years.
5,My girls love it!,I purchased this collection for my 3 and 6 year old daughters. They absolutely love it! And my husband and I also enjoy watching the DVDs because we grew up watching Looney Tunes on television.
4,shortage of the road runner,i really enjoyed the disc set of the golden collection but was extremely disappointed that there was only one short of the coyote and road runner. They were my favorites. I don't see why warner bros. didn't include much more of these two characters. I feel Bugs Bunny was overdone. But otherwise it was a good collection. Wish there was a set of just the road runner and coyote-I would buy it.
3,"Great, but still lacking","Overall, a great collection. The Warner Bros. commentary is very interesting, but there are some cartoons that I was disappointed didn't get picked to be in it: ""Ant Pasted,"" Elmer Fudd's best-ever solo performance where he's at war with an ant colony; ""Beep Beep,"" the second-ever Roadrunner/Wile E. Coyote cartoon with a hilarious mineshaft chase; and ""Buccaneer Bunny,"" one of the best Yosemite Sam/Bugs Bunny cartoons ever where Sam is a pirate. It's still a great collection, but review the list of featured cartoons first."
5,A THEOLOGICAL GEM,"William's short yet vivid essay on the events of 9/11 is a theological gem. While many clerics in mainline churches quickly jump on political bandwagons in crises like these, Williams offers profound theology which speaks directly to the soul. A must."
2,Does not live up to its promising title :/,"The concept of flying under the IRS radar, minimizing taxes paid while maximizing returns, etc, all sounds very well and good to a person interested in escaping Uncle Sams financial oppression. The title of this book suggests that it will instruct you on how to achieve this, but aside from vague and intermittent hints to this effect, the book is little more than an ongoing promotion for the authors newsletter, which you must subscribe to in order to divine any substantial tips he has to offer. With various personal anecdotes, hyped up queries about what you will do with all the money you *could* save, and tax techniques that are hinted at but never quite divulged, reading this book felt like a person who realized the motivation seminar he is attending is little more than a pitch for another product or service. Unless you are a devoted fan of Robert Carlson, I'd suggest trying a comparable book with more actual substance."
5,Unprecedented True Adventure,"This is a true story by a man who decides to travel, alone, in his old Toyota Landcruiser, from the very north of Africa to the southern tip. Absolutely phenominal. From Morocco through the sahara to the mountains and the jungles. Meeting the local people, not as a tourist, but as an interested friend. This was no Hyatt Adventure Tour; this was a face to face, in your face, communion with Africa in all of its diversity, hardships, and human spirit. That this was done by one man, alone, is truly unique in our age. If you read nothing else this year, you owe it to yourself to read this book.Oz Latrobe"
3,Israelische Pop-Queen,"an interesting mixture of pop and a more interesting, professionally made sound in high quality, than the earlier albums.otherwise typically Dana international-sound.I like it.It is a paperback-cd-package in professional sound an a nice inlay."
2,"It is not the book, but the short course notes.",I was expecting the complete book. It is not. This is a short course (one day) presentation complied in a booklet.
4,Russian Sambo Wrestling:Vol.2,These moves in this second volume are a little more complicated. But Nicholas Starks teaching style is slow and patient. You will learn the moves and there slight variations.
2,Replacing Eurocenturism with the Asian equivelent,"Andre Gunder Frank compells his readers to expand their view of how the West actually rose to the top of the economic world. He makes a nobel effort but, he lacks the evidence to support his often changing thesis. Instead he supplements it with a biased view of history, and challenges experts with lame assumptions. Frank neglectes to recognize key factors in Europes rise, including the industrial revolution. this book should be read with skepticism."
4,Sani-Solution,"Product works great.........has to, there's no alternative. Merchant stinks, though. At the same time, ordered this AND another box of granules. Products are expensive enough, and made assumption that since BOTH orders were placed at same time they'd combine & ship in one box at once. NO, they hit me up for shipping TWICE! To add insult to injury, never received the Sani-Solution! Stuff cost me $45 after shipping. Smarthome says it arrived & I say it didn't, but they're content because they've got my money. Complaint was filed with Amazon, but that's gone nowhere, either.Find another source like I had to."
1,Not for CatGenie 120,This cartridge is not compatible with the CatGenie 120. Make sure you are buying the correct cartridges for your model CatGenie. I made the mistake of trying to save a little money and bought the wrong item.
1,Glad this works for you guys!!,"Doesnt work for me.It gets hot enough, but the trigger doesnt push hard enough for the glue to come out.If I push it with a stick or pencil, that works!!I hate it when I spend money on something with such good reviews and it doesnt work!!!!I guess I got a lemmon!!??Glad to see it works for the rest of the world!! :\To me, its a POS!!"
1,Don't think its supposed to catch on fire,"So I ordered this figuring its a simple tool with a simple purpose, why pay more than $3 or so.... well, open the package, notice the plug doesnt quite look the same as your standard American plug. Plug it in, put a glue stick in it... after 20 seconds or so, I was about to pick it up, when sparks started shooting out of it. Sparks flying from the trigger and any hole in the plastic. I yanked the plug out of the outlet before my fuses blew or something, and the glue gun had smoke coming out of it. I threw it out the window before my house burned down.Please don't buy this. Its terrible crap made in terrible Asian factories and isn't compatible with USA electricity. Serious risk to buyers."
1,Terrible,It's made cheap and didn't work. The trigger didn't work and the plug in seemed to small. The chrome on the plug flaked off. The worst object that I have bought off of Amazon
4,Package was kinda crushed...,Product was great! The plastic container was crushed and glue sticks just loosely lying inside the protective plastic. Otherwise great :)
1,Garbage. Broke in less than 5 min.,"The cord for this glue gun is definitely not rated for a device like this. It's thinner than anything I've seen before.I took the glue gun out of the package, put a glue stick in and let it warm up. It produced a glue dot about the size of a quarter and then just stopped working. Unplugged and replugged, nothing. Complete piece of garbage.Silver lining: the manufacturer immediately refunded my money when I told him I wanted to return it. They told me I could keep the broken glue gun as a bonus.Sweet bonus."
2,Trigger broke too easy,"Even when the glue was very hot, the trigger spring broke right out of it. The item was then rendered useless."
1,Gone does not hold up!,I used the glue gun about 5 times and on the 5th time the gun overheated and blew up! It is cheap for a reason! You might as well spend the extra money to get the better glue gun!
4,Works Pretty well,The only complaint I have is that the cord to plug it in is so short. Thankfully I had an extension cord to use it.
1,Don't Buy It,"Where do I start? This product is garbage and worse, a serious safety hazard.-The cord is only about 1' long making it useless without an extension cord.-The cord is undersized for a heating appliance, making it a shock/fire hazard.-The product is labeled as containing cancer-causing materials.-The product has no brand-name and no rating/listing details. Typical a product like this would be list by UL, confirming it as safe. The blue label in the picture which appears to contain this data does not actually exist on the product. Borderline fradulent advertising.-Heavy duty? What a joke. The trigger broke after an hour of use.-The kickstand doesn't keep the gun up and the plastic nub holding it in place broke after 3 flips of the stand.If you value your time, money, and frustration level, buy something else.I've contacted the seller for a refund. We'll see how that goes."
3,It does the job...,well like the title says the glue gun gets the job done but I just hate that the chord is like the length of a ruler T_T thats way to short for me...
3,Good Enough to do the job,"Cheaply constructed, and takes longer to heat up than I thought it would, but once it does heat up it does the job. Just remember there is no on/off switch, so the moment you finish gluing you have to unplug it so it'll stop drooling out hot glue."
4,Fine glue gun,"I am not a super crafter. I use this to fix things like hair-ribbons, toys, etc. That said, it seems to be sturdy, safe, and well worth what I paid for it. I would purchase it again."
2,"Short Cord, Overflow of Glue","This hot glue gun does what it is suppose to do, maybe to good. The glue is melting at such a fast rate and the nozzle is too large so unless you are using it constantly it is dripping everywhere. Also the cord is only about 2 feet long so you should plan on using an extension cord or be very close to an outlet. On top of that, the cord is very flimsy and cheap. The wire protection separated from the wire after only about 1 month of use. I would not recommend this product unless you are simply looking for the cheapest glue gun for a 1 time project."
3,Cheap but works,"The gun works, but it feels flimsy. You also have to load in two glue sticks at a time, one will enter most of the way into the chamber to melt, and then the other one can push glue out. As others have said, the cord is really short and the gun takes a long time to heat up. Also, the gun is listed as using 7/16"" diameter (.44 in) sticks, but it actually takes .28"" diameter sticks."
2,Fragile,"This glue gun worked badly from the first time I used it. The glue would continually ""drool"" from the nozzle after getting heated up, wasting copious amounts of glue. Secondly, after 2 days of hardly any use, the product broke. The chassis of the glue gun is made of a cheap plastic that broke apart at the handle very easily, discontinuing further use.However, for the price, this is what one is to expect, however, the shipping made this gun a no-deal.In short, if you are looking for a glue gun for actual use, find something else.Also, there were no 2 free glue sticks."
2,Sheila & Shanna's Do-over,"Women Loving Women If you were excited to see a movie about love-making with beautiful women, this movie is not for you. Yes, the women are pretty, but the love-making is stilted and ruined by the men in the movie. So save your money and run away from the sleepover."
3,"Starring Maclaine, Lake, Fraiser and Fraiser!","A very cute story about a case of mistaken identity. A pregnant, single girl (Rikki Lake) meets Brendan Fraiser and his very pregnant wife on a train. There is an accident, and Lake unintentionally assumes the other girl's identity. Brendan Frasier is always a pleasure in any film, and is twice the pleasure in this film...he portrays twins! I thought trying to pass Lake off as an 18 year old was a bit ridiculous. Shirley Maclaine was very good. I don't know who played the chauffer, but he was excellent. It is an enjoyable film, but full of holes. Try and not think about the absurdities of the plot and you may enjoy it."
1,Beware--New DVD is pan & scan only,"Please be aware that Columbia recently ""revised"" this DVD. The prior DVD had both widescreen and pan & scan on the disc. This new version has only pan & scan. How's that for progress! Thanks Columbia!Amazon's technical details still show widescreen, which they had told me they would correct after shipping me two copies to try and get me the widescreen version they were supposedly selling. It's a great thing that Amazon is understanding about these things."
1,not happy,I bought this dvd for my mom. this dvd is not for the u s region codes.... and did not say otherwise when I bought it.. so now I have a dvd I cannot play
5,Amazing.,This movie is so cute and adorable. It definetly helps put you in a good mood. I bought this for my mim on her birthday and she absolutely loves it. I recommend people buying this movie or at least seeing it somehow!<3
4,Captivating Dark Comedy,"Ricki Lake plays a homeless/destitute mother-to-be who is befriended by a family of wealth and importance once they believe her to be the widow of one of theirs who has perished in a train wreck. Brendan Fraser and Shirley Maclaine dominate as her ""new family"", with Brendan this time out playing the stronger-family-member comic role to perfection and Shirley this time out playing the anxious/comic mother responding with an outsized emotional reaction to every little thing her uptight son does. Fraser and Maclaine play a classic 1930's Hollywood comic duo to perfection and keep the film rolling at a sprightly pace until its unexpected ending. All in all an absolute delight even if Ricki Lake, a charismatic television personality in her own right, does not have the spectacular ""superstar"" comic flair of Fraser and Maclaine at their best. This is a filming of a novel entitled ""I Married A Dead Man""."
5,*Enjoyable Movie To Watch*,This movie was excellent.I loved watching it.It had sadness and happiness in it.It definitely is a movie that will make you see that nice things can happen to people.
4,ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE IN THE WORLD OF LOVE!!!!,"VERY ENTERTAING AND ENJOYABLE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!Having been an unwed mother, I could feel Connie's pain at being dumped by a boyfriend, and left with nothing and no where to go. It was by chance she happened on that train and the chain of events that later ensued. Ricki Lake is very believable as the preganant Connie and Brendan Frazer is wonderful in the duel roles. I enjoyed the way Ricki and Brendan related to each other and I could feel the chemistry between them. Shirley McClain rocks!!! Athough my story didn't have the happily ever after that Connie has, nonetheless it gives hopless romantics like myself something to believe in."
1,Yikes!,"This movie is just terrible! Complete drivel and dreck! I forced myself to watch it as I had already rented it, but about 3/4 of the way through I just couldn't bear it any longer. Please do not buy or rent this movie, please . . ."
1,WHAT are you people THINKING?!,"This has got to be the WORST movie I've ever seen! Stupid,stupid storyline! TERibble acting! BADly Scripted! How Ricky Lake EVER got her own TALK-SHOW, I'll never know! I am SHOCKED and APPUALED by the good reviews people have been giving this!"
3,Brendan the Wonderful,I love Brendan Fraser he is my all time favorite actor!!! but I was really disappointed by this movie. first of all I think that Ricki Lake as a teenager was way to much of a stretch. and her acting was a little crued and I didn't feel as though there was any chemistry at all between Fraser and Lake I mean if you compare the romance and chemistry of this movie and that of lets say Barrymore and Scott in Ever After it REAKS!!! but it did have it's good points like well Brendan's on screen humor I thought that he portrayed it very well not like there's ever been a bad Fraser movie well any ways I give this movie 3 stars.
5,We want the DVD,Please if it helps of something here in Mexico are lots of people that loved this movie and we want it on DVD.
1,"Read the original, see how terrible the movie is.","Who cares about the quality of the DVD with such a piece of mindless drivel. I went out of my way to see this movie in the theatre, knowing it was based on Cornell Woolrich's noir masterpiece ""I Married a Dead Man"" This movie is the very antithesis of the work it was based on...a vile corruption of the dark, hopeless spiral into despair and miserable life-sucking unhappiness that was the original...(Imagine an Edgar Allen Poe tale recast with the Care Bears) Avoid this movie like the plague, yeccch! yeccch! yecch! -- And besides the acting is terrible."
1,MRS. WINTERBOURNE,"MOVIE RETURNED TO SENDER, REFUSED TO LOAD INTO EITHER OF MY DVD PLAYERS.COMPANY REFUNDED, INSTEAD OF SENDING ANOTHER REPLACEMENT.REV. MICHAEL J. MICHINI"
2,Disappionted,This disappointed me. An hour into this film it was obvious there was going to be a mad rush to the credits - and so it does with RL giving the occassional insipid sigh at BF (she got wind?) and no indication whatsoever as to what suddenly makes her so desirable - Bill falling for Patricia is just so unbelievable - there's not so much as a hint as to how it happens - hey if NOT doing a bad thing catches me a Bill.......BF is amazing as ever - if only that he actually manages to act the part of a man besotted with the insipid windy one (she CANNOT act!) - 10/10 - I've never known a face that can say so much...sigh (wind?)....if you are a Brendan fan you will sit through this once - then forward wind all the bits he's not in. I'd really really recommend renting this - buying it would be a step too far! which is a shame - it could've been a good film but poor Ms Lake is so bad - oh you just want to cringe!
4,good for the entry level clinician,"This is a fine book for a clinician who is not at the entry level of competence. I recommend it for neurology interns and advanced medical students, mainly because there is not a better one in print. I think it lacks many therapeutic details, is too long for the student looking for a quick read power review, too limited for the advanced clinician."
5,wonderful,"Silvio Rodriguez is different from anybody else. If you don't know his music, you should listen to some. Since you're reading this in English, you might not know that Silvio is a giant in Latin America. He can fill a stadium just with his guitar, reedy voice and poetic stories."
5,Wonderful tool for teaching empathy to young children,This is a wonderful book! David McPhail has done it again - written a book that will live in the hearts of all children who are privileged to be able to read it or have it read to them. I am a school counselor and purchased the book to begin a unit on teaching empathy to 2nd graders. The children were moved and the book encouraged deep thinking. The author does such a fabulous job of presenting the differences in the boy's world and the hobo's world and then unites them in a beautiful moment awash the recognition that they aren't so different after all. It brings tears to your eyes and warmth to your heart.
3,Interesting Insight,"Author's egocentric description and insights into the inner workings of Hitler and his entourage, both personally and politically, during the period of time between the two world wars. I found it interesting in parts, but often tedious and dull."
3,"Fascinating, but many incidents are questionable.","Hanfstaengl writes a fascinating story. My first reaction was ""methinks the man doth protest too much."" As one researches Hitler in depth he finds that many of the incidents as presented by Hanfstaengl are completely erroneous and others questionable. But it is a very well written book that is a good ""beginner's"" book on Hitler--but read it with caution, and don't quote him as factual until you check the ""fact"" out with more reliable sources."
4,A very good book.,This book from Ernst Hanfstaengl was very insightful. He was in close contact with Hitler and his innercircle for sometime. He discusses Hitler's behavior and personality. Hanfstaengl has much to tell since he was in close proximity to Hitler during the early years of the Nazi Party. Anyone that's interested in Hitler should read this highly informative and readable account. I learned quite a bit from reading it. I recommend this book.
1,Where's the rest?,This performance only has six of the eight movements of the Mass. It is missing the Offertorium and Domine Salvum. Of course I didn't bother to check track listings until AFTER I paid for the download and noticed it wasn't all there. So here's one more movement: Caveat Emptor.
1,Do not buy this drive. It's too slow.,"I have owned many thumb drive, and always from a name brand such as SanDisk and Lexar. The transfer rate has always be blazing fast with them. I came across of diskGo because it's cheap, and the specs look decent, so I gave it a try. The drive arrived, and I put it on a test drive, the read speed is great, just like SanDisk and the Lexar I owned, but when it come to write, it's so damn slow. Took like 20 minutes to copy 4 gb. I can do better with DVDR.Another bad feature is the drive is not clip to the cover. This is my first assumption when I see the picture, the cover and drive are one. Needless to say, I lost the drive."
2,"Wimpy, but it works.","I was hoping for something a little more rugged but this drive seems forever in danger of disconnecting from its shell. It works fine and seems quick enough, but does not inspire confidence."
1,I threw mine out,"I was looking for a flash drive with the capacity to transfer documents and e-mail from my Mac G5 desktop to my G4 laptop. Because my 2G SimpleTech was not big enough, I decided to try the 4GB DiskGo USB 2.0 Flash drive. What a mistake. Not only is it the slowest flash drive I have ever used, I can never get it to unmount from my G5 either.So today I just threw it out. For me, it simply is not worth the trouble it took to use this drive. Too many complications. I have always loved my SimpleTechs -- back to the 256 days. So I will see if they have something with enough capacity now to help me."
2,Free Trial Software - Where?,"When the product arrived it was in a small plastic resealable bag measuring 1"" by 2"". There was a small fortune cookie sized note stating that all reference material could be located on the URL that was provided. When I went to the site I found the basic information I needed to get up and running. There was also a statement that ""All DiskGO USB Flash Drives are shipped with Cryptarchiver Lite, a limited version of the encryption software which encrypts data up to 128AES"". Every time I tried to access this I got a message asking me for my password that was suppose to have been emailed to me from Diskgo. I called their tech support and they said no password is needed and the product ships with the software. After going round and round with their tech support I finally gave up. Cryptarchiver may be a great product, but if you can't install it how do you know???"
3,Cheap cover,"Yes, this little flash drive will do the job, but i was not impressed with the quality. The plastic swivel cover came off instantly, and is a poor design. Once you remove the cover, the flash drive works fine, but I've seen many of these for similar prices that are a lot better. If you're going to be using this a lot, you may wish to look at a different model."
2,Do not use for Vista Ram Booster,"I could not get this to work for MS Vista Ram Booster. Tech Support told me to remove and insert several times and it may work.I typically have to remove and retry up to 5 minutes to get it to work. That is much more than ""several"" times. It also seems to forget that it is a Ram Booster drive and I have to reformat and try again.Pass on this product for Ram Booster."
5,Fantastic,"It's a history lesson, a technical lesson, poetry, reminiscent, nostalgic, bittersweet, and poignant. Funny, realistic, and lots of footnotes - it's clear he's done his homework! I learned a lot, and enjoyed it thoroughly.A great read - I learned about some of the technical work, and some history and even learned about other countries, and I didn't even realize I was learning - my favorite kind of book.The pictures were awesome."
1,cheap little-Winning Over Weight-booklet,"I think for the price of this little booklet, it should have been much more. It could have been mailed in an envelope, so even the shipping was too high. I was expecting more reading material. It's just a bit more than a track that is left at the laundry mats. Whatever, we learn. Not happy, price too much!!!"
5,Your Kids Will Love This!,"I think this is one of the best children's books around. I have a 6 yr old and a 2 yr old - and we have MANY books - but this is my favorite, and my 2 yr old's favorite too. It is a wonderful part of a bedtime ritual!"
3,It's just ok.,"If you like softcore, wait till you can buy this one for $5 or less. There are a couple good scenes but one of the girls was a little weightier than you'd like to see, unless you like them that way, then this will fit your liking."
4,What the heck is that?,Jane's is the preeminent publisher of all things military and this handy little book is no exception. Most of the reference books on ships are fairly large and unweildy to take on the road. This guide has great pictures and summary information on most military ships operating in the world's navies. I use it as a checklist for my model collection to keep track of what I have. Nothing worse than excitedly buying a model you already have. It is also good for a quck reference in those heated naval discussions:)
4,Hilarious,"Don't be fooled by my 4-star rating; this video is truly terrible. Terrible, but entertaining. If you like to laugh at ridiculously horrid filmmaking, this one is great. My brother and I still pull it out once in a while for a few laughs.Raaaadical, maaaan!"
5,SEE 8th DEGREE BLACK BELT BOB FABREY,"Shatter 1,000 lbs. of clear ice!Break Baseball bats over his shins...Flying sidekicks into Flaming Cement blocks...Astounding reverse flip wood breaks...Robert Fabrey, an 8th degree black blet in Shorin'ji Kempo system is an internationally known, two-time world record holder for breaking 1,000 and 1,100 lbs. of ice with the knife edge of his hand in a single blow.Fabrey served as an official branch chief representing the Mas Oyama Karate System in Tokyo and is Director of Martial Arts for Gold's Gym in Niles Ohio."
5,an orchid lover's foundation guide book,"I have been an orchid addict for as long as I can remember. I started raising native orchids in the early 80's in my country of birth, the Philippines, using the trial-and-error method. My backyard venture was successful but it could have been so much better if a guide book, such as Ortho's Complete Guide to Orchids, had been easily available then. (There would have been less plant casualties.)This is a must-have guide book for orchid lovers, from novice to intermediate levels, who WILL benefit from its general information on orchid selection, cultural requirement, diseases, etc. I have given copies of this book to some of my family and my friends who have contracted my ""addiction"" to orchids."
5,Beautiful Book,"This book is great for beginners and those who don't have a green thumb. Growing orchids takes some patience, but with armed with knowledge beforehand, you too can grow these enchanting flowers!"
2,Fairly mediocre,"I'm not at all into the history of the man-made orchid hybrids and cultivars, for which the authors this book have a strong affinity. Expect frequent plugs for the AOS (American Orchid Society). This book has the same ""pretty picture and overly general advice"" formula that you can get in every other book for beginning orchid owners (or better yet, for free, on the web). I prefer Cullina's book in general, and something like Botanica's orchids as a reference for more species-specific care guidelines. In the end, I think its pretty unreasonable to make sweeping care recommendations about orchid genera, which often have 1,000+ species from a wide variety of habitats. But, I suppose this book is just as good as any other beginner guide- though others may be cheaper, and the web is cheaper (and better) still."
2,Complete Guide to this Seller,"Hey Folks - the Complete Guide to Orchids was listed as a new book, it was not by a long shot. Caveat Emptor."
5,Great insight into his classic songs sung live,"Having watched this video I have to say that it is excellent, All of the songs on this video have a different air to them when sung live which is often more striking than the studio versions. This is an excellent buy for either a hardcore fan or a vague fan."
5,Great book,This book is great. I am about half way through with it right now. I am really enjoying it.
4,Jewelry much lightercolor then picture shown.,"Jewelry recieved is much lighter color then picture show, but delivery time was quick and in great condition."
2,Only if you have a calm baby,"I thought that these would help during diaper changes for my little one. If you have a baby who moves around alot during diaper changes, these are useless. Much easier just to use a diaper or baby wipe. Novel and cute idea, but not realistic for the squirmy ones."
1,These are silly,"These things rarely stay on, and even when they do, once the pee stream starts, it pushes the teepee right off anyways. Unless your baby is motionless, or is a weak uninator, then don't even bother with these. You're better off just putting a dry wipe on your boy's junk to deflect the stream and soak up the pee."
3,take it or leave it,"product is ok, the teepee doesn't seem to stay covering the area it is supposed to alot of the time since baby is always squirming around! It's smaller than expected..."
2,Cute Gift but not Effective,"Our son is very squirmy on the changing table, so the teepee never stays in place. These are a great idea but don't work as we'd hoped. We've given up on them and just risk getting squirted."
3,Not bad but it could be better,"This item definitly has some advantages but the best way I can describe it is ehhhh. It's VERY small and while it does work exactly as described any force behind the pee will ""shoot"" it right off plus with the size any decent amount of pee will soak the item and it will drip. Now honestly, dripping is MUCH better than getting shot in the face by a stream of pee but since the item is small and light it can easily be shot off. While this item does have it's advantages, something a little bigger with a slight more weight to it would be perfect. Not bad but not good either."
2,nice idea,What a great idea! I loved the concept but they didn't hold up in the wash. The bag seams came apart and some of the little teepees came apart.Would recommend if they were made better :(
2,Shipping was quick but the product is no use,If your baby is a wax model this would work perfectly. Maybe I am doing it wrong but at 3 am in the morning need an easier solution. I now use a cloth over my baby's peepee works great!
4,I hear they're good,"I bought these for my boyfriend's sister. After hearing stories about getting squirted in the face and walls, I thought these would be a good idea. She said they work good, but I guess they fall off sometimes."
5,Does what it's supposed to.,These work as advertised. They do not absorb. So your safe from the stream but be prepared for the puddle.
2,Don't really stay on...,"Cute idea, but not really practical. They might work if your baby doesn't kick his legs very much when you change his diaper! My son kicks them right off. :("
1,Cute but they don't work,"This is a great idea, but they did not work. They do not stay in place and the peepee stream blows the teepee right off if it is in place."
3,Smaller then they look,"The tee pees are cute but smaller then I thought they would be, also they aren't that absorbent. They will keep you from being sprayed but still have to change entire clothing etc. Washcloth worked better but isn't as cute."
1,Not working as you wish for,"Regret not listening to those feedbacks of telling how useless of this product. I would never recommend it. Just waste of money. Should have spent that ten bucks on diapers. It seems 1star is the lowest rating, ow, would give 0 star."
1,Too wee Peepee Teepees,We were very disappointed with this product. In comes in the tiniest little bag and they are soooo tiny ... not at all what we expected and really only good for a laugh over the name ...
2,"Haven't used once, but man are they cute!",I bought these for my infant son. I thought they were adorable. Despite everyone telling me to save my money an use a cloth diaper over him I bought these. They are very cute and creative but not practical. They are very small and do not stay on my son. These would be a very cute gift to give at a shower or something but not to buy for yourself. I haven't moved them from the bathroom so no one has even been able to appreciate the cuteness of them and I haven't been able to appreciated their effectiveness because they don't work. Save your money (even though you can't resist how adorable they are)!
1,A Novelty but not Useful,"Weeeell...this thing is nothing more than a gag gift, if you ask me. An attentive parent will notice that the child pees in a pattern, not willy-nilly spraying the moment his nappy's off. My newborn has spaces of about 15' between pees. Add to that, there is the wake-up-pee that happens within 5 minutes after he wakes up from a nap, and the after-nursing-pee that is about 30' after a breastfeeding session. If we parents can notice the cues for when baby is hungry or tired, we can also learn the pee cues (the pinkle dance, nostril flaring, staring in the distance, latching on-and-off the breast), because Lord knows we ain't dumb. :)"
2,save your money and use a washcloth...,bought it as i really wanted it to work..... Use it as a gag gift for another but dont expect it to really work......
3,Form over function,"I would say these are ok if your kiddo doesn't wiggle around, but it always falls off my little man when he kicks his legs. But, it is good to have something over the wee wee and is a great, cute gift idea for those having boys. They tend to wad up when you wash them in the washer even when I put them in a lingerie bag, but that's a given since it's all cotton. The item arrive on time and in good condition"
2,Of Little use,"I agree with other reviews saying it is not very useful, except maybe in the very newborn period. Once my son started moving his legs it was pretty much the end of the peepee teepee use.. It does not stay on when u need it to. Maybe it it had a strap to keep it stable it would have been of better use. I wouldn't recommend it. I didn't use it more than a week."
4,cute baby shower gift,This is a cute idea for an inexpensive little addition to your baby shower gift. I didn't give it 5 stars purely because it really isn't something I think a new mom would continue to use regularly.
2,Can't handle the force!,"I would love to say that this worked out great for our son, but unfortunately the Peepee Teepee could not hold up to the strength of our son's pee, and served more as an interesting fountain moment followed by the need to still clean up. Even moreso since we were caught unprepared with the cloth we normally had on hand. Great concept, but would not recommend."
4,A Very Good Historical Mystery!,"Sharan Newman writes a very good medieval mystery. She does her homework on the historical facts for the time that she writes in (12th century France), and the authenticity of these facts, combined with her compelling character development make for a ""page-turner"" of a read. Catherine and her Edgar are the liveliest set of sleuths out their in the historical genre. In this outing Catherine's father have asked Edgar and Catherine to find a religious relic that has been stolen from Edgar's home country of England. Those following the relic's progress think it has made its way into France. Not only do we get to follow our protaganists in their search, but we get a clear picture of what relations were like between the Christians and the Jews in Paris in the 12 century. Ms. Newman's plotting is as good as her characterization, and this is a very enjoyable medieval."
2,Pretty bad,"I had to read this book for my history class but I found I couldn't even finish it. My professor warned us that it was ""cheesy."" Personally, I thought it was more unbelievable thus a boring waste of time. Sort of female sherlock holmes in 12th century France, I just didn't buy it. Definitely start at the beginning of the series if you're going to attempt this. I don't think I'll bother, since there are plenty more historical novels out there that are way more enjoyable than this."
3,No Steel wear strip as described,"According to description ""This model also features a steel wear strip for extended blade life and improved knock-down system"" There is no visible steel wear strip on the blade."
3,Second part of the Chronicals of Pedro Cieza de Leon.,"The service and the packaging was wonderful. The price of the book was too expensive for the information you get. The topic of the Incas as always is very interesting msterial to read.Thanks, I do enjoy learning as much about this wonderful culture! they were great!!"
2,Boring and hard to read!!!,This is a great book to be an autobiography but there is little information about anything other than her travels. She uses words that most common people would never use. It is almost like she tried to use every word she is has ever heard before.
4,Good so far,"While I have not yet completed this book, I have found it to be a very well-balanced look at the life of a person better known through legend than history. The readability is excellent. Gillingham takes a very balanced view of Richard, looking at him both in his own time period and from our own. I highly recommend this book."
4,"Not too bad, considering its a highlights CD.","I much prefer the full soundtrack over the highlights, but this one does a very good job of giving the listener an idea of the plot/emotion. This CD doesn't cover much background to the story, and presents a ""wham, bam, thank you maym"" presentation. overall not too bad though. If you can i reccomend you watch the musical too, either in person or on tape, but don't get an edited version."
3,Not the best cast but the complete one,"I give 3 stars for being a complete recording but not the best cast ever.. I enjoy the OLC and OBC and most of all the Tenth Anniversary Concert. TAC is best... star-studded and the best cast ever. Well, Dream Cast I suppose.. In this complete recording, I find most of the talents here are irritating and somewhat funny.. voices are too squeaky and grrrrrrrr.. who is that girl performing as Eponine? Can't they find much better? She's irritating me.."
1,Why? Why?,"Why? When they make a highlights cd, they usually take a double cd, or in this case triple, and make a single cd containing the best songs. However when their are so many different albums of les miz to choose from; why would they pick the one with the worst cast? I do not understand. This cd is not good at all for several reasons: the cast is bad, there are not many songs at all (only 17 out of zillions of other cool songs from les mis), and finally this cd gives you no idea of what les mis is about. Buy this cd for one reason: you are poor and cannot afford a double or triple cd version."
2,(Hestitation...),"This is the second album I heard on Les Mis, after hearing the Broadway Cast Recording. At that time, I had not start studying Les Mis yet. (To be honest, I didn't even know Colm Wilkinson was the original Jean Valjean when I listened to the Broadway Cast. And I didn't know it actually opened in London.) I started my usual music analysis process as I listened to the album. (Please be remined that I had no idea who was in it when listening. This is to avoid any bias it may cause.) I haven't noticed that all the remarks I made at the time correspones so much to the real world's critics until I started reading literatures on Les Mis. This recording has several great performers but it also missed a great deal in terms of casting. The Complete ""Complete recording"" would be worth while if you look for an ""almost at the show"" experience. Other cast recordings have a better over performance than this recording."
5,Great Music and Musical,I rate this has a great musical for people to see and learn from.IT has really great music and a wonderful message that weill touch your heart.
5,"Beautiful, Haunting, Lush",Thank you Blackmore Night for your Romantic Collection - BEYOND THE SUNSET. I purchased this CD to set the mood for Valentine's Day. I have pleasantly found this CD to be one of my newly favorite musical selection for quiet times spent at home. I'm looking foward to exploring more of the music of Blackmore Night. Thanks.
4,Cute pictures and up-to-date advice,"Dale Sigler loves guinea pigs. And he wants to let the world know that it's OK for grownups to have pets. You don't have to pretend it's for the kids- you're allowed to love cute, fuzzy little things without any excuses.The book contains wonderful pictures, useful tables of information. The Quick-start chapter is especially helpful. Learn why piggies love parsley, how baby guinea pigs are different from most babies, and why two guinea pigs are better than one.My only quibble would be that the book could have used a little bit more editing; sometimes the sentence structure is a little *too* much like talking, which can be confusing in print, without voice inflections and pauses. One would like a book that will be a permanent part of one's library to have been edited for grammar and punctuation. But that's a small quibble to a delightful book."
4,Good informaton on guinea pigs,"I was reading some of the reviews from the readers, and i just have to disagree. I'm 12 years old, and I have a guinea pig! I take ALL responsibility for her. I feed her before I go to school in the morning, and change her cage 2 times a week, by myself. So I have to disagree with a women who said in her review that parents will have the responsibility for taking care of them. Except of course the parents will have to take them when they go to the vet, because I can't drive. This book was very helpfull, but a little confusing on the grammer side. Good luck if you get a guinea pig!"
4,Good book,This is a good book for any guinea pig fan. I'm glad it's a part of my collection. Interesting read for kids and adults.
2,Guaranteed Results - The title is the best part,If you are a novice practitioner of financial planning or a new investment advisor you may get a little out of this book. The book is a random compilation of marketing ideas and tidbits that will work for some financial advisors but most of these ideas are basic common sense (marketing and sales 101).From an organizational standpoint this book is poorly written with no real main point or theme.If you are an advisor learning to grow your practice there are several other books more worthwhile; put this one at the bottom of the list.
5,Guaranteed Results,The book is easy to read with lots of practical advice that can be easily implemented without much cost and effort. A must read for all small businesses that are serious about their success.
3,Interesting concept but poor cinematography and weak dialog,"Being a fan of military films, I found this movie to have a novel story idea, but poor in execution. The cinematography was jerky and took me out of my ""suspension of belief"" when watching the film. I also found the dialog to be very simple and the characters are really just sketches with little depth. The viewer never really gets to know what is inside the the members of the scout squad; they are just tools for the action sequences. On the plus side, I did enjoy seeing how the scouts operate behind enemy lines, gathering intelligence. Overall, I would have to say I was a little dissapointed and am surprised how immature the craft of the Russian film is compared to U.S. or European equivalents."
4,"needed a little breaking in, but very cute shoes!","The straps on the right foot seemed a bit tighter than the ones on the left, so, I got some blisters when first wearing it. However, over time, the fabric stretched a little making them much more comfortable. They're great! So cute and yet so comfortable!"
1,Really?,"You have to take 6 of these every day, spaced out throughout the day. Who is going to remember to take 6 vitamins??"
5,You'll Learn Every Note,"The Hal Leonard's ""Recorded Versions Guitar"" series take you through an album note-by-note. What does that do for you?Maybe you just want to learn a song that you really like. Perhaps you're that guitarist who wants to study a particular artist or style. Maybe there is a lick or a turn-around that you just can't figure out. The accuracy of these books answers all of these scenarios. They are transcribed in notation for those who read music, as well as in guitar tablature for those who don't.I have several of these books, and I find them to be an outstanding tool for any student of music. Their transcription of ""Riding with the King"" is no exception. Accurately translated and clearly displayed, this book delivers exactly what it promises!"
1,Dead Lingo,"Received - 3/8/06Died - 3/10/06In between. - I was using it for German. The vocabulary isis small despite the ad claims. It only has theroot words.It would be much better to have it do one languagewell than 16 poorly. Obviously, it would havebetter if it worked more than 2 days too."
1,Lingo TR-1650 Travel Mate 16 Language Translator Review,"The translation is horrible. I am fluent in English and Spanish and out of 10 words, only 2 were correctly translated."
3,"Not bad, could use a revision.","I got this for my dad and it wasn't that good. It knows how to translate ""Thank you"" but it can't translate ""You're welcome"" so that was pretty lame. It needs a revision and then it could be more useful."
2,You must know greek to translate to Greek,This was one of the few inexpensive translators that would translate to Greek. However when you translate English into Greek it displays it in the Greek alphabet which I am no good at pronouncing. A phonetic translation would've been more appropriate.
1,Not working properly,I still have not gotten this Lingo to work properly.Can I call the Manufacturer to help me?Please advise. Thanks.
2,Short on words,"This translator should have been a comprehensive dictionary of words of a given language. Many critical words to help one translate signs, menus, and the language are missing. In fact, many needed words are missing. This is a half-hearted effort to sell a product. It would have been much better if they would have chosen fewer languages with a full dictionary of words instead of a scattered selection of words with a few phrases thrown in."
4,Great service!,"Came in time for Christmas, best price around, and my mother loved the gift! Would definitely work with them again."
4,Work Sandals,I bought these for my daughter and they are super comfortable without looking big and clunky. Perhaps because of how they are meant to cradle your heels the size is not true to fit. I got her a size larger than her regular size. My friend had the same experience she got a size larger just to get the primary benefit of this shoe the comfortable.So the only reason why it is not at a 5 is because the advert did not focus on saying buy a size or a 1/2 size up.
4,snow rake operation,"I haven't had a chance to use it yet but it seems sturdy, easy to put together, and I received it in an excellent time frame. I will give it a 4 star rating for now and will see how well the task of using it will be. I have purchased a number of things at Amazon.com and have not been disappointed yet. It has become my own shop-at-home net-work."
3,Its okay.,"Shoes is okay. i bought these shoes because i like really light shoes for running, they fit great but if you have fat feet or something maybe get a size larger or it gonna be really tight."
2,Life's too short for this book.,"Ian Frazier is a good writer--let's get that straight. The downfall of this book is not how he writes but what he writes about. I wasn't bored out of my mind reading this book, but it just didn't do anything for me. I like to read books that move me and this book had a cruising speed of 0-1 mph. This book is a generational playback/story about his family. I often thought how amazing it was that the author could write in a way to sound like he was speaking to the reader and to keep me (just barely) reading on to the next page. This was sllooowwww reading and I thought, ""with all the books out there, I am just wasting my time reading about something I really couldn't care less about. There was nothing too fascinating about his family story. (At least to the point where I finally quit---about 1/2 way) I would never ever recommend this book. I would recommend sitting comatose in front of the tv watching really bad sitcoms over reading this book."
5,A beautifully written family saga and history of the US,"This is a remarkable book. Frazier did a monumental job of researching his family history and produced an eloquent family history that parallels the country's history as well. The book can be read as a beautiful and fascinating family history, a meditation on the role of religion in U.S. history, and as a portrait of many memorable figures both within and without the author's family. His descriptions of his brother, father and mother brought tears to my eyes."
4,Lovely Video!,"This is a nicely done video that gives a great representation of Italy and Switzerland. I really enjoyed the culinary delights episode where they taste cheese in Parma, and Balsamic Vinegar in Modena. It really made me yearn for Switzerland, especially at Christmas time."
5,Good,Very detailed and thorough. This book is huge. The pages are really thin and highlighter bleeds through. Use a yellow highlighter. Gives a great background on Pathophys. Most chapters are long. Gives great scenarios. I enjoyed it but it is so freaking huge. But what would you expect for a Pharm book. I'm studying to be a Nurse Practitioner and it is very helpful.
4,Very good,"I received my book in a very good satisfying condition.It is a used book but for real it isn't look like that. This is the kind of book I have been wiling to own, but it was impossible because it was so expensive. I want to thank amazon for its great effort for assist us getting our needs with affordable prices. I recognize it doing very well because it ensures that you get your needs within your chosen period and address. For people thinking that AMAZON could be one of people stealing from people's accounts, I really disapprove that. Amazon is an honest company serving costumers interests. To people willing to get their needs with affordable prices feel free and feel safe with Amazon."
3,It's not DiPiro...,"My pharmacy class was switched to this book because our Therapeutics course master edited one of the sections. This book is okay, but it isn't DiPiro. I don't enjoy the case studies because they often encompass drugs and conditions that I still haven't learned about. I find myself reaching for DiPiro to fill the gaps."
2,Bit Flimsy,"I purchased 3 of these switches to install into Door Jams for a Security System. When installing and making-up the screwed terminal connections on my first installation, the terminal post became loose (in its mounting/insulator board) causing it to become inoperatable...no contact. On the remaining 2, I removed screws and soldered wire connections. They have been operating satisfactorley for the last month. I just hope that internal contactor components aren't as flimsy as the external connectors. Be very gentle/careful when making-up screwed connections! Shiny metal frabrication gives it a ""Durable Look""."
3,Good product,I got a few to light my kitchen cabinets and works fine. From time to time one of them fails and I have to press it several times to make it work again. To big for what I really need.
1,Not accurate in the least bit!,"Unfortunately, I had several problems with this book. First, the title says that the book provides information about the person's love life, special destiny etc. The book does not provide this information for most days in the book. I just read my friend's date of birth and it never mentioned anything about her love life at all. Secondly, I have read many profiles that were not only inaccurate but complete opposites of the people for whom they were describing. Needless to say, I am very dissatisfied with this book."
3,Compact and improvement over Nelson's Concordance,"I'm not crazy about this Concordance, either. But what can I expect? It's chock full of words in a small volume, therefore, the lettering is small BUT it is DARK so it's much easier to read than Nelson's Compact Concordance!! So, if you're looking for a Concordance that's possible to carry around that you can actually read AVOID Nelson's and choose Cruden's. Just make sure you bring your glasses if you need reading glasses!!! (By the way, this is good for the KJV which is the only version I'd heartily recommend anyway.)"
2,The print is too small and they cut the scriptures down to just a couple of words.,I have to say that this poor thing has been collecting dust in my room for months now. The print is too small but that I could have handled. The big problem is that to save space they cut the quotes down to just a few words and it makes it very hard to find the right scripture. In the end this will go in the garage sale. Not worth the money.
4,Ray Charles What'd I Say,This is one of Ray's first LPs were he rocks with the suggestive song for it's time. This is a great CD with the original version of What'd I Say and other gems. Ray was an inovator in the many genres of music that he sang over his very successful career. If you are a Ray Charles fan this is a great album for your collection.
1,Destroyed!!,My labadoodle destroyed this in less than 2 minutes. The rubber pieces came apart when she chewed it. To be fair she destroys just about every toy!
1,Not long lasting,Looks cool. Looks like an idea. The material is just not durable. Our Australian Shepherd broke it apart in a few minutes.
1,chewed it up in an hour,A real dissapointment. Our Golden Retreiver bit through the rubber in a matter of minutes. even ate a few pieces from it and then smelled like rubber! Don't waste your money IF your dog likes to chew her/his toys. Otherwise its a cool toy.
1,life span: 30 minutes flat,"My miniature dachshund DESTROYED this toy in 30 minutes flat. I thought it'll be cool since it has nice colors and twistie-chewable-parts, but it didn't even last an hour. Suddently my bed was completely covered with tiny little rubber pieces and my dog was still trying to swallow a small piece. I wouldn't recommend it for dogs that like to chew things to pieces (like all dogs do), once they separate one of the flower-shaped rubber pieces the whole thing comes apart and it's even easier to rip into a million tiny pieces."
1,Lasted 5 mins,My bull dog happily chewed this toy for 5 mins till I had to take it away from him for his safety. :(
2,not durable,I got this for my 10 week old dachshunds and by product descriptions figured it would be good for their sharp teeth but they tore this up in a couple days pieces were found all over the place they did enjoy chasing it but its not good as a chew toy
2,dangerous toy,My 25# BT chewed the outermost ring apart within 2 weeks' time. I was able to unravel the outermost ring and still use the rest of the product as a ball under my constant supervision but I cannot let my BT play unsupervised or she will tear it apart!
2,Fun but NOT long-lasting,"My dog loved this toy for about half an hour and then one of the twisted connections came loose, then another. PRetty soon I had to take it away from her :-("
2,Its fun and all......BUT......,"I am a recently instant step-dad to a 6 y/o rottweiler and thought I'd get her some fun new toys. This Nobbly Wobbly looked cute. Opened the box yesterday morning, and she was sooooo excited to play with the ball....BBBBBUUUUUTTTTTTTT.....DON'T BOTHER!!!! This ball lasted not even 24 hours, before it was torn apart. Kind of bummed I didn't read the customer review before hand. Sorry Charlie...we'll find you a new toy."
1,Nasty rubber smell,"My dog won't touch this thing, and I'm pretty sure it's because of the smell. I even tried putting peanut butter on it and he refused to lick it off. He hates this toy."
2,Not sturdy,"I purchased this for my terrier mix, thinking that it could withstand his play habits - unfortunately, he had it destroyed in less than five minutes. If your dog is chewer like mine, this is not the toy. It turned out to be a waste of my money... But, on the otherhand if your dog just plays and doesn't pull or chew on it, it may be alright. Good luck"
1,Destroyed in 5 minutes,Destroyed in 5 minutes by a rat terrier. Do not buy!Instead get a kong stuff-a-ball. Lasts at least 6 months with two intensive chewers in the family (about 30 minutes of chewing a day) - you can put cookies in it.
1,Not meant for strong chewers,I bought this product for a 2 year old golden retriever and the dog chewed it up within minutes. Not worth a buy for large dogs.
3,I had to throw in trash,Chewed up within minutes... Unfortunately for the power chewers like my doxy-scot there are no good toys that last long. She would rather have a stick from one of my trees in the yard. Which she gets now and then. Would not recommend for any dog small or large that has big chewers.
1,Did NOT Last!,Very disappointed in this toy... our wo dogs destroyed it within 5 minutes of having it. We were watching them and they were playing with it when all of a sudden they had pieces coming off of it... very disappointed.
1,cheap,"For a toy they say is durable, my lab had this destroyed in minutes and I was picking up little colored pieces for weeks. Do not buy!"
4,It depends on the dog,"One of our dogs is addicted to this ball. She will not let the other dogs near it, but we keep it up when there are other dogs around just to make sure it is not destroyed. Most of our other dogs are either indifferent to it, or will destroy it in a matter of minutes. But Jesse will carry this around all day and beg us to throw it for her. It really depends on the dog as to how long this ball will last. It is soft rubber, so it does not take much for one of the links to be chewed through. Once one link is gone, the rest will fall apart."
2,My dog wouldn't play with it,"It has a noxious rubber odor and she won't play with rubber toys. If your dog doesn't mind the smell, it might be fine. It's cleverly designed and colorful but mine has just been a good prop for photos until I donated it to the dog shelter."
2,Puppy liked it,"My puppy loved this toy and for one reason....he is a sheltie and can chew right into it. You have to really watch your puppy with this toy because he/she can chew off hunks of the rubber or whatever the material it is made of. Also, it is a very heavy toy as well."
2,Not much fun,"My dog didn't like this toy very much. He didn't play with it once, or even try to pick it up or anything. It might be a good toy but it definitely wasn't the right one for my dog."
2,nobody likes this ball,"I have three dogs. Two labs and a doberman and not one of them is even remotely interested in this ball. They will go after it if I throw it, but once they go get it, they generally leave it sitting there and grab a tennis ball instead. Save your money and buy more tennis balls!"
1,Not Designed for Heavy Chewers As Described,"I purchase this toy for my Weimaraner, who is a heavy chewer. It is hard to find toys that hold up to her chewing. I gave this to here and she had it is little tiny pieces in less than 20 min. If you dog is even a medium chewer I would say not the toy for them."
1,Shouldn't be advertised as a chew toy...,I gave this toy to my 7.5 month old australian shepherd (who i wouldn't consider to be an intense chewer) tonight and he had it chewed apart within 30 minutes. The rubber is not made of the same quality as other rubber chew toys (like a kong) so dog teeth can slice right through it.
2,It's the only one toy...,"...that my dog really doesn't like and truly never played with it.He really loves toys, from teddy bears to nylon bones, but this one never got used.I'm gonna donate it to our local shelter because it never saw use...Can't explain why, my dog never told me the reason... :o)"
1,Not for hard chewers,I was skeptical but had read a few good reviews for this product. It lasted less than an hour with our mastiff. This was also one of the few balls that he's been able to obliterate so quickly.
2,Great until it falls apart,"This was easily one of my miniature schnauzers' favorite toys until it started unravelling. The parts snap together like a puzzle, so it was not long until it started coming apart. My dogs are not what you would call ""powerful chewers"", so I can only imagine what a larger or more active dog would do to this toy. Please let your dogs use this toy only under direct supervision and discard it as soon as you notice it disintegrating."
1,Nobbly Wobbly Ball now Nobbly Wobbly pieces,I was disappointed. It didn't last 5 minutes with my 8 month old yellow labs. Now I have dozens of start shapes in my yard.
2,Not for aggressive chewers!,"Well, the concept is great, but the reality isn't. Our doxie loved the ball because it wobbled like crazy when she played with it. But within a few minutes she had substantial chunks of the rubber chewed away. Since she also eats most anything, we took the toy away from her immediately. This would be great for dogs that don't really chew on their toys, but if you have an aggressive chewer, this is a waste of your money."
2,indestructible? NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Re-name Easily annihilated!,"I bought 5 ""indestructible"" toys for my dog.. opened up a few.. gave them to him . i was in my office for 2 1/2 hours.. i walk out and almost every single toy is in a BILLION pieces around my house. Especially this one! he chewed thru this plastic with one bite, it was like snipping lines out of a rope knot with scissors. Leaving these plastic/rubber pieces literally scattered across my house. I'm STILL finding pieces more then a year later. People really need to TEST their "" indestructible"" product. Gunner, my dog, Is half Pit Half german shepherd. He is VERY smart, Tall but THIN.. and Can break out of one of those metal kennel things.. EASILY... i've had to cover them, trap them against things.. he has chewed/bent all the metal in it and squeezed out. ridiculous... But i would LOVE to find a toy that last longer then a day."
2,Great for 30 min,"This product is a choking hazard for pets. I gave this two stars because my Lab mix loved it. That said, he had torn it to pieces within 30 minutes of me giving it to him. He was able to swallow several of the pieces of rubber, and I was forced to take it away from him. If I were not supervising him, he might have been in worse shape. Please do not buy this product!"
2,This is a LARGE ????,"If this is a large, I'd hate to see a medium or small. It looks bigger in the photo.I have a year-old Blue Heeler coming home tomorrow and am apprehensive about how long this will last. I expected much more.Check this out in the pet store before you buy it here."
1,Lasted for 10 minutes,We have a Weimaraner and she chewed this up in 10 minutes into pieces. I do not recommend this for a Medium to large dog who is an agressive chewer
1,Lasted less than 1/2 hour.,This toy is dangerous in my opinion. It was in pieces and he just started to swallow so quickly.
1,KnobblyWobbly Pet Ball,"My dog is a chewer and also loves playing by himself with various balls, rolling and tossing then chasing them. Not this ball. He scoped it out when I first gave it to him but hasn't touched it since. Maybe because it smells so unnatural. This ball really reeks."
1,Not worth the money,My kids think this is a better toy than our dog. Wasn't worth the money I paid for it. Comes apart too easy.
1,Not For Little Dogs,"For some strange reason Mrs. Spudman bought a size large Nobbly Wobbly for our ten pound Bolognese who already has at least fifty other toys scattered about the house. Gabby has shown no interest in this toy, a weighty object weighing over half a pound and made of large, intertwined rubber rings. It's too heavy for Gabby to carry comfortably in her little mouth and hard for her to grip.Of course, you could say this is the buyer's fault for buying too large of a toy. True. However, we did have a smaller version that worked much better, but was eventually destroyed by Gabby and her two cousins. My daughter bought one of these for her hard playing Australian cattle dog who destroyed his ball in a day. Even for the larger dog, I think this ball is too heavy to play catch with. It does or did work for playing fetch with Merlyn the Australian Shepherd."
3,"One was awesome, one was not ...","We bought this toy almost 7 months ago and it is still going strong without any problems. So while making an order for some books last month I figured I would get another one just to have as a standby if the first were to get lost. To my dismay the new toy showed significant wear after only a day of chewing. This must be an issue with the batch of material that is used to make each toy, and an obvious quality control issue that Multipet has yet to rectify. I would still recommend this toy, but not as a chew toy. Buy this for the fun ball it can be, and you just might get the indestructible toy I have seen stand up to 7+ months of heavy chewing."
1,Disintegrates in 5 minutes!,"Tried this ball twice, in 2 sizes. Each one lasted 5 minutes before it was in dozens of dangerous pieces. Maybe okay for very light chewers."
1,DID not recieve,"I ordered this item along with another in November and I have yet to recieve it. It is past the expected delivery date and their is no other options on contacting the seller. Poor, poor service."
1,not a hit,"the Nobbly Wobbly Ball is decent, but neither of my dogs want to play with it. I dont think they like the taste of it."
4,my dog loves it,My daughter had one of these balls from a party goodie bag and my 2 year old German Shepherd got a hold of it and has not put it down!!! She is LOVES this squishy little ball so much I had to find a replacement. I read the other reviews of the dogs destroying them and all I can say is my dog did not. She chews it like a piece of gum almost carefully. It obviously is not made for occupying a dog like a kong or bone so yes if left to her devises she would probably ruin it but for play its wonderful. I plan on buying a few to have on hand for when she does eventually wear it out! Great toy!!
1,Didn't appeal,"I'm not sure whether the plastic has a bad taste because my terrier mixes, who normally adore toys, refused to play with this toy after mouthing it a few times. I've tried all sorts of games to interest them, but they spit it out and walk away as soon as they pick it up."
3,not as good as the original,"This latest version of this dog toy is not made of the same material as the one we bought over a year ago. This one fell apart within days....the original lasted over a year. The dog still loves it, but I'm disappointed that it isn't as durable as before."
3,didn't hold up,bought this toy for my son's giant puppy. The pup loved it but took a bite out of it within five minutes. Not near as durable as I had hoped. :(
1,Disappointing Toy,"I have a 6 month old dachshund who has begun chewing up all of his toys now that he has his adult teeth. When I saw the Wobbly Ball - billed as a Large Dog Toy I thought I had finally found a toy that he could play with and not destroy. Boy, was I wrong! I have to say that my dog loved the ball right out of the box. But within a mere 10 minutes he was able to chew large pieces off of it. How disappointing. This toy just does not stand up to any chewing if a 6 month old puppy can destroy it so easily. I'm sending it back."
1,Junk,"It took less than 1mn for my English Springer Spaniel to rip rubber chunks of rings.Definitely not a chew toy... Returned for credit, don't buy this junk !"
1,"Your dog may play longer with 7, $1 bills...","I'm one to generally look at reviews but for once, I failed to look at the reviews for this dog toy. I have a 2 year old, 55 pound, German Short-hair Pointer; it took her all of 8 minutes to destroy it. UGH!"
2,Flimsy,"Pretty put it did not last long at all, not very study for a dog to chew on at all. It only lasted about 20 minutes max or my medium sized dog."
1,TERRIBLE!,DO NOT BUY THIS TOY! I threw it away within five minutes of giving it to my 30lb. Beagle mix. She had chewed off large chunks of the rubber and was choking on it. COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY.
1,Not for large dogs,This toy only lasted about 5 minutes with our 10 month old Lab. Probably better for smaller dogs.
1,Destructible,"My German Short Hair Pointer had this torn apart in minutes. It should not be listed under ""Aggressive Dog Toys"". It was a waste of money."
3,"The Dog Loves It, but .......",You might want to buy more than 1 :) I gave it 3 stars ONLY because the dog really loves it and if he chews on this I can save a pair of shoes :) The dog I have is medium sized and usually has this thing starting to come apart in about 7-12 days. I throw it away as soon as he starts to get pieces on the floor since I know the next ones are in his throat. I watch him with it and he can play with it all day long and its cheap. I keep buying them but wish they could last longer.
1,already in pieces,"Dont buy this if your dog is a chewinator, my min pin had it in pieces in minutes."
1,I would give it 0 stars if I could here's why...,"An insider stated that if you want more of the looney tunes and avery toons to come out in box sets in the future, then you must buy the looney tunes golden collection. The premiere collection only has half, 28 as opposed to 58 total on the golden collection. There are no commentaries, galleries etc. Why would you want this piece of garbage? If you want Warner Brothers to release the older and funniest looney tunes (red riding hood etc) then buy the golden collection. I have background sources on this folks. The golden collection will last you months and is a better buy. If you want to learn how these toons were made buy the golden collection! I'm telling this for a reason! The golden collection is the best choice."
3,"Fun, But....","I know it's only the first volume in an ongoing series, but where is ""What's Opera, Doc?"" That's the most classic cartoon ever. (""Kill the wabbit! Kill the wabbit!"") I also would have liked the one with the ""Rabbit season, duck season"" bit on it, but noooooo. We get Foghorn Leghorn and those two ultra polite gophers (not that there's anything wrong with that.) I hope the subsequent volumes have a better mix of famous cartoons.If I had to do it again, I'd spring for the boxed set."
2,Why not spring for the Golden Collection instead?,"There are a few stand out classics on this 2 disc set, but they're all included on the far superior ""Looney Tunes Golden Collection."" In a shameless and misleading attempt to sell more Looney Tunes DVDs, Warners packaged this 2 disc set twice. I will say that the cover art and packaging for the 2 disc set is much more attractive than the clip art Golden Collection art. Save the extra few bucks and buy the 4 disc Golden Collection instead!"
3,Good but not worth 4-5 stars!,"Recently purchased Vol 1 and 2 and am enjoying these discs. They say they are remastered and restored, but the only thing remastered & restored are the title screens! Watching on BR I can see miscellaneous little dust particles and slight cuts(?) on the screen. Some of the top parts of the screens are slightly cropped but once you accept that you just try to enjoy. That being said I still enjoy seeing these gems."
5,Looney Tunes- Great!!,So impressed with the shipment quality and speed of shipment. I am also so impressed with the products.. I love the old classics and I am very happy! Thanks
1,If you buy this edition you suck!,"Why anyone would purchase this edition rather than the Golden Collection is beyond me. Some may say that it is a cost issue. If this is the issue, it is better to live without Looney Tunes on DVD than to settle for the (incomplete) Premiere Collection. Don't be lame and destroy future sets for the rest of us who care about complete non-lame collections. If you purchases the Premiere Collection you are telling WB that that is what you want; and if that is truely what you want you suck!!!!"
4,A Fine Introduction to Warner Cartoon Madness,"If you cannot afford the complete ""Looney Tunes"" volumes, ""The Premiere Collection"" is a good alternative. Among the highlights in this two-disc set are ""Fast and Furry-ous"" (the first Road Runner short), the Oscar-winning ""For Scent-imental Reasons"" and ""Feed the Kitty"" - plus underrated gems such as ""Frigid Hare,"" ""Baton Bunny"" and ""Putty Cat Trouble."" Solid entertainment for viewers of all ages."
1,AVOID THIS DVD AT ALL COSTS!!,"It is a watered down version of The Golden Collection with the same bareboned cartoons you catch on television every single weekday afternoon! The Golden Collection contains the exact same cartoon shorts PLUS many more and has tons of cool and entertaining extra features that will appeal to both children and adults - Dont cheap out on this, go with the Golden - you will NOT regret it!!! The value well exceeds the cost (which isnt too bad)."
3,Not for Enthusiasts; Perfect for Others,"The Premiere Collection is not for hardcore collectors, just folks who want a crisp, clean collection of 28 classics. Ignore those who accuse WB of greed -- not that I'm a fan of parent AOL, but they clearly offer this as an alternative, not addition or attempt to swindle. Only a maroon would think otherwise."
4,"This disc is good, but also in the Golden Collection","This is a good disc in it's own right, as it has some great classic Warners toons. Be aware that the Looney Tunes Golden Collection has this disc along with three others, and is a better overall purchase if you're a real Looney fan."
1,No thanks,"The reviewer ""Paulo Liette"" is completely wrong. This set might be affordable, but it is a RIP-OFF! You can get this stuff off of TV for FREE. Just buy the Looney Tunes Golden Collection, there is stuff that's not on TV on that set. The PREMIERE COLLECTION DVD is a waste of money, you will regret buying this terrible DVD set! This is one of the worst releases of classic cartoons on DVD ever."
1,Remastered???,"I bought this, it said remastered so I was hoping for some quality, it has none. There is loud buzzing throughout most of both dvd's the color is awful...carrots are not green. It would have been fine in black and white but that is not what is there. The quality is lacking, I am deeply disappointed with this product."
3,I love looney tunes!,The collection of shorts is a nice addition to any collection. But I was a little disappointed to find that the cover was a little disceptive. It wasn't blended very well. By that I mean it was more focused on one or two characters instead of a mix of all of WBs finest. This disc was primarily tweety and sylvester. But there are some good laughs anyway so I am still enjoying myself!
1,"Why, WB, why?","If the release of this DVD in any way demonstrates the path WB might take in bringing their vast animated short collection to the public, then this is harbinger of a great travesty to DVDs and animation alike! WB did the right thing with laserdiscs years back, releasing 5 sets of 4-disc collections. They have taken the first step with the Golden Collection available today. This is a potential step back! If you truly are interested in seeing these great cartoons, buy the Golden Collection, NOT this one. You'll be glad you did, and every fan of WB will be glad you did, too. BTW, the laserdisc sets have held their value for a reason! They are going on eBay for about $100 a box! This won't..."
1,a bad deal!,The Golden Collection is a much better Looney Tunes DVD purchase! This set has fewer cartoons and no bonus features. Why bother??
4,Looney Tunes is the Looniest !!!,"I have not purchased the Gold Collection, but I believe the Premiere Collection has a great selection of craziness. Over 10 years ago I purchased about 5 VHS tapes of various Looney Tune cartoons, the premiere only has a few of them included on the DVD. I still think the Premiere is a good choice for anyone who loves their cartoons as much as I do. I do think it would have been better if they only had put out the Gold Collection. Then you would not have a choice as far as price. Of all cartoons, Looney Tunes are still the best. For around $20, depending on where it is purchased, the Premiere would make a great xmas gift."
1,Awful!,What is Warner thinking? There are no special features! You can tape this stuff of TV for free. If you want to get your money's worth get the Looney Tunes Golden Collection 4-disc set.This set is an insult to buyers everywhere. Go Golden Collection! Don't buy this piece of garbage.
2,Go for the Gold,If you really don't want to spend the money for the Gold collection you may take a look at this little compilation. But if you are truly a Looney tunes fan than most likely you were compelled by the first time you saw Bugs Bunny. The Gold collection contains some of Bugs's most honorable tunes on disc 1 and basically disc 1 is worth the difference in Gold.
1,I don't understand the logic,"Sure the cartoons have been lovingly remastered, but they haven't even picked the best cartoons from the Golden Collection, just issued the third and fourth discs. So, not only are you missing the classic cartoons that they left off of the Golden Collection, you don't even get the classic cartoons (esp. the Daffy-related ones on Disc 2) that *are* in the bigger set. If you're even thinking for a moment about buying this disc, don't. Save up for a month or two longer and get the Golden Collection instead."
1,B E W A R E *PLEASE*!!!!!,"If you are obsessive compulsive like I am, and buy things without looking at them first, please be warned that this collection of Looney Tunes cartoons are ALL CONTAINED within the Golden Collection also released this past November 4th!!!I would suggest you buy the Golden Collection, but remember that if you do, that you do NOT need this collection."
1,Go for the GOLD!,"Whilst cheaper this DVD set isn't worth the saving - the gold set contains special features and 56 restored shorts - this set will be bare bones. Additionally, the sale of the Gold Collection will depend on whether Special Editions of Looney Tunes are released in the furture - buy this and you might be restricting the value of what we see in the future. Limited extras, limited value - GO FOR THE 4 DVD GOLD COLLECTION!"
5,I LOVE THE LOONEY TOONS!!,The Looney toons are the best! They don't show them on T.V anymore so the only thing you can watch of the looney toons are DVD's. This DVD has all of the best episodes. IF you really like the looney toons like me I would get this DVD.
1,WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If there wer an option for zero stars, I would have chosen that.If there ever needed to be any more proof that the DVD market is full of corrup, evil and greedy executives, this DVD is it.If you are a fan of the Looney Tunes, don't purchase this set. Buy the Gold Collection instead. All The Premiere Collection is is a simplified version of The Gold Collection. I don't know of any fan who would rather fork over their dough for this, instead of spending a bit more for the bigger and more comprehensive set.I haven't purchased this, and don't plan on doing so.Warner Bros is greedy. They percieve us to be overly-gullible idiots who will buy anything. Which, sadly, is the case with almost all studios.Please: don't give into their insolence."
1,Don't get this one,"If you want to see the classic Looney Tunes go buy the 4 disc ""Golden Collection"". It's much, much better."
3,Spotlight Collections (Looney Tunes) Tweety!!!!,"I enjoed watching all the Spotlight Collections from the Looney Tunes, however, I was dissapointed to find that there were a lot of Tweety Shorts. I don't like Tweety cartoons; they are not for me. I would definately recommend these series' to anyone that enjoys watching Tweety or can bare to. The choice is yours, is it worth buying and collecting the series' if you will only see about half of it in non-Tweety shorts?"
1,Don't Buy This,These are Remastered ? looks like your looking through a dirty lens who want's to see a bunch of dust spots. I got alot of DVD's and this is the worst one i got.Not Worth It Save You'r Money and get the Looney Tunes 4 disc sets.
2,A Few Good Laughs,"While looking for the 4 disc Golden Collection, I stumbled across this premiere set.The 2 disc collection as a whole I was disappointed in, there were many worthy shorts besides the one that were included on this ""budget"" set that would have made buying the Golden Collection even more attractive in my opinion.There are a few good ones on this, such as Bunker Hill Bunny, Sam the Sheepdog vs Ralph Wolf (funny stuff!)Marvin the Martian was not even the right voice :o(Save your money and buy the Golden Collection for you die hard Looney Tunes fans like I am."
4,Captain Sensible Captures The New Age Christmas Spirit,"I would rate this X-Mas compilation a 5+ on the strength of track #10 alone. Captain Sensible's 1984 single, ""One Christmas Catalogue"" is one of the best pop songs I have ever heard. It's synth pop intermingled with overdubs of sound bytes from distant Christmas movies of the past, create a nostalgic overload. I first heard this song on the radio in December of 1995 while attending Brigham Young University. And up until just recently I was finally able to locate this CD and buy it. ""One Christmas Catalogue"" is a classic 80's hit that deserves much more airplay during the holidays. It isn't every day you stumble onto a song this good! This is a must have single for any 80's alternative pop fan!"
5,Great Manual For Exercise Professionals!,This book is a must have for all exercise professionals. All of the guidelines for exercise in healthy populations as well as with certain diseases are discussed in this book.
4,Book,This book came in great condition with no marks. It was exactly what I needed for my class and cost less.
1,Not for beginners,"This book is not for anyone who hasn't done programming before. After a nice introduction and history report, the author suddenly starts showing you charts with things like ""ushort 2 0 is 65,535"". And says stuff like ""Using floats, you can represent the numbers 1.0 and 1.00000012, but you can't represent any number between."" What?! What does ushort mean? What are floats?! I must be just stupid, because when I read ""This book approaches the topic of C# for a total beginner"", I thought it meant it was for a noob like me."
2,Decent intro but outdated,"This is a nice basic introduction to game programming but, as mentioned before, there are mistakes. The version of Directx code is out of date.Usually, one can go on-line and get updates to the code from the developer that fix the mistakes and get the code working with later releases.Unfortunately the author has not updated the code and it doesn't look as though the web site has been touched for a couple of years. It is riddled with missing links and php errors. For that reason alone, I just can not recommend this book to people who don't have much experience as developers."
2,Not that good,"No. Don't buy/get this book. I have previous experience with programming (Programming I and II (C++ but just split in 2 classes)) and I thought I was decently familiar with C++, so I wanted to learn more. I thought, hey, why not C#. I heard many games for the Xbox are developed in XNA and they use C#. So I thought that I'd get this book. Yeah, no. Don't get it. If you were to buy a book for a beginning C# tutorial with examples, get ""Beginning Visual C# 2010 (Wrox Programmer to Programmer)"" This book teaches you a lot. This book teaches you how to output data on the screen correctly, how to do math for calculations, how to make if-else statements, and how to create classes for objects like cards and players from scratch. In the first 6 chapters alone I have covered almost all of what I did in Programming I and part of Programming II. I say if you want to learn C# from a beginner's stand point, get ""Beginning Visual C# 2010 (Wrox Programmer to Programmer)"""
3,"C# The future, THE FUTURE!!!!","C# is definitely an easier language to program in then C++ or Visual Basic, but the beauty of this book is that a lot of those codes are interchangable with C#. From 2d to 3d designing this book really is a staple, nay a foundation of information perfect for any skill set, I found I was a beginner to C# but was not a beginner to coding, it does help if you have done a few Hello world programs and some basic coding before but all and all this book is really easy to follow."
3,Not Good for mountain bikes,"I have a mountain bike with bolt on front wheel and I needed a lock to secure my bike when I'm in downtown Philadelphia. This Lock is really heavy and sturdy but does not expand enough to include the frame and front wheel of a typical mountain bike. I have to use it along with a chain.All in all, it is a nice sturdy lock and comes with $1000 theft insurance (except in NY). All you need to do is fill up a couple of registration forms."
