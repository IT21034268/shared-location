2,Over priced for what you get,"Over price for what you get. Got a bag which really cant be used. Two broken straps and a tear on the bottom. I saw better priced ones, but I'm the type that ""you get what you pay for"" so I went with the higher price...I guess it always doesn't work."
1,Two of these have both failed after a few months,"Product sounded great while it worked. The first one would take a while before connecting to the fm radio in my car. Had it replaced. Second one lasted 3 months and it started to lose power unless the main unit was positioned in a certain way on.(it had a swivel so you could position the LED readout.)It simply stopped working.Scosche never responded to either of my calls/emails. Amazon was kind enough to replace the first one, which was beyond the return date and refund the second one, also beyond the return date."
1,waste,this will drive you crazy. as the car speeds up so does the whinning in the sound. i sent it back
3,Need to use headphone plugs for some Ipods,"I bought the device for use with my 1st-generation Ipod nano. It didn't work so I took it back to the store for exchange. The second device also didn't work - I then discovered that it worked when connected with the headphone plug (not with the USB cable, which the instructions state is for all Ipods except Ipod shuffle).Otherwise, the sound quality is tolerable but not great, which seems to be the norm for this type of device."
1,The worst piece of junk I've ever bought,"Wow, not only did the device have poor sound quality, but it's poorly crafted. The spring mechanism that holds the unit into the cigarette lighter receptable was so rigid that once it was in, it didn't come out. After about 20 minutes of forcing it out, the device broke. I had to dismantle the dash panel and actually remove the receptacle. Thank goodness I knew how to do it otherwise it would have cost extra $$$ to have a mechanic do it. Be warned."
1,WARNING: you will not get the right product!,"I ordered this 2 times and both times received a universal HOLDER, not the FM transmitter they say you will get. There is a problem in the warehouse and I recommend you do not order this until they change the description to match the image and correct item."
2,Terrible sound quality & proprietary connector,"I bought this at Staples because mySoundfly SD WMA/MP3 Player Car Fm Transmitter for SD Card, USB Stick, Mp3 Players,iPod, Zunedied after three years. I didn't want to interrupt my audiobook, so I purchased locally at high cost. I am using this with a Kindle Fire, not an iPod.The sound is terrible. There's a lot of poor stereo noise and car frequency pickup. The noise I suspect is from the headphone cable and/or a very poor transmitter. Unfortunately the headphone cable is a very thin wire which will be prone to noise, but is not replaceable due to the proprietary connecction to the transmitter.I'll be returning this once my replacement Soundfly transmitter arrives."
4,Wish there was more music from the film,"Oklahoma! as a film was quite entertaining, but the record could include only small portions of some songs, such as Kansas City and Out of my Dreams. As presented in the film these numbers were great."
3,Awesome if you have the cabinet to fit,"I would buy four of these if they would fit in the cabinets where I keep my spices and oils and other cooking and baking supplies. Unfortunately, it appears it only comes 13.5"" wide and my non-dishes cabinets all have openings of 9"". I sure hope Rubbermaid, or someone, starts manufacturing in more than one size!"
4,Just as expected!,The product didn't get a five because I wasn't surprised by the quality. Don't get me wrong the product is fine and for the price it's perfect. The quality is more than adequate for a kitchen drawer but if you are using it in an industrial assembly machine to cut corners and save on your budget it won't hold up. Perfect for residential home projects.
3,"Not bad, but not as good as it's made to seem","OK, I'll admit it's nice to have a full color guide to every card, but it's really not as useful as it seems. It's an excellent one time read, but after that it loses it novelty. I have a subscription to InQuest, and I consider it better, with constant updates, as opposed to paying $20 every four sets, especially at the rate they're being cranked out now."
1,Doesnt work - Do Not buy,"I bought this phone because it looks great and allows up to 6 separate phones to operate on the same system. Unfortunately, the signal from the base is too weak so 2 of the phones only work sporadically and 1 never works. In addition, there is a long delay after you answer the phone before the caller can hear you speaking. All-in-all, only buy this phone if you want to look at it, not actually use it."
2,"great home phone, but display broke in a few months use",I liked this phone for it's size and that it works great without reception problems. The speakerphone is good also.The problem I have with this phone is that after a few months use the display text became too dim to read. Now I have no caller ID or the ability to access the stored phone numbers. The warrantee requires the phone to be sent to factory and wait 4-6 weeks for return.
1,Beauty is only skin deep!,I bought this phone because it was so awesome and modern and little. My little grandson fell asleep for his nap with the phone under him and crushed the lcd display and is was under warranty (two months old) but the ge people considered it misuse so they wouldn't fix it. Six months later the phone itself won't work. I have had better luck with cheaper phones and am very disappointed in this one.
4,Slim but effective,"Have had this phone for a few months with 2 extra extensions. Like the slim design and ""cool"" blue light. Best feature for me is the speaker-phone which plays quite loudly and can be heard by the rest of the family w/o trouble. I also like the fact that you can assign the ringer to other family members...when the wife calls me it is the ""William Tell Overture"". I come in with Bach's ""toccata and fugue in d"". In silent mode, the phone lights up in blue only...nice in the home theater room so as not to be disruptive. All in all, sound quality is fair-good and the units diminuative size is nice...just be careful not to sit on it if left on the couch!"
1,If you like listening to static in a tin can...,"My wife wanted this phone because of its small footprint. This is the worst cordless phone we have ever owned. ""Worst"" means that it doesn't provide clear sound. Do not buy this phone if sound quality is important to you."
1,this phone is not worth it buy something else,althouhg this phone is attractive i would not tell anyone to buy it. this phone does not hold charge and finding the batteries has proven to be a mission this phone has not worked correctly since i bought it. should have returned it. dont waste your money
1,"Good-looking, but no substance! Don't buy it!","Don't be fooled by this pretty face. It sounds like you're talking in a tunnel. Voice quality is better on the worst cell phone. I expect more from a land line phone. And, to top it off, the return process with AntOnline is turning into a nightmare. I am not a satisfied customer, and I doubt if I will become one when this is over. I think I have simply wasted my money."
1,"All style, no substance","I purchased this phone for two reasons: 1) the claim that it is interference free and 2) for it's beautiful design. When it arrived to my office, I immediately plugged it in to charge it so it would be ready to use when I got home. Once home, I plugged it in and it looked great in my living room. I then took it off its cradle and tried to make my first phone call. There was so much static that I could barely hear the dial tone even while standing right next to the base station. Because this is a DECT phone, there wasn't a way to switch channels as in other cordless phones. I tried relocating the base station to the opposite side of the house and encountered the same problem. I've since returned the phone."
3,digital phone,"I have a cable tv/phone/internet lineall digital my previous phone cuts out and sounds horrible.this phone is nice I like the keylock so I can carry it in my pocket.I love this phone I hate the ""digital"" phone but this phone helps."
2,Not that great,"I have read many of the other James Bond book, and this one seems very incomplete and follows no real story line."
4,Excellent watch sports,"Watch very nice, very light, it is both sporting and casual, very fashionable, I recommend it widely."
1,BAD!!!,"The examples (teaching portion) is saddly lacking, explainations are glossed over, worse yetto answer questions you'll need additional instruction formulas and steps from other books..."
2,There are better alternatives to this.,"The bad part is that I had to buy this book for my Probability course, and I will probably end up throwing it away after the course ends. There are exercises in each chapter I have covered so far which have little to do with the material in the chapter. I have also found material which is introduced with little or no continuity. The language is rigid, and the flow of thought is not linear. Overall, it makes the learning experience less efficient, and more frustrating; it increases the load on the student, who is forced to make the connections himself, instead of presenting them in the text, as appropriate, or introducing them via exercises which connect with the current chapter material.The good part is that there are books out there which, in my personal opinion, and using my understand-o-meter, are much better."
2,"Book is good, however missing pages",The copy I received was missing pages 319-366. I figure this out now that I'm halfway through my semester and need it for finals. CHECK YOUR BOOK FOR COMPLETION
5,Great!,"Roomy,good long handle... I'm 6' tall and it fits me well. Durable (so far), tons of storage, rolls smoothly, and it seems to be built with quality. I've had it for about 4 or 5 months and am completely satisfied."
4,Good bag,"This bag is very well made and nice as an overnight bag with space for 1 laptop and its associated gear. I was looking for something that would accomodate 2 laptops with lots of extra gear and this did not fit the bill. I feel it is a well constructed bag with room for files, a change of clothes and a laptop but I carry too much stuff for this bag. I would also like the handle to be a bit longer as it was a hair short for me (I'm 6' tall). If I didn't carry all the gear that I do, it would have been a great bag at a great price."
1,Could the requirements be clearer?,"I'm kinda annoyed at the fact that it is not compatible with Windows 2000. Most software makes that clear on the box, but this one does not. It says minimum 95/98..usually minimum means higher is better. I couldn't tell you how fun this game was because I frankly, couln't run it. Please be advised!"
1,Dino Crisis,"Dino Crisis? this game was a crisis, that's for sure. This had to be the worst game I ever bought. The controls are lousy, the characters have no dimensions. I threw it in the trash after a few hours of playing."
3,Missed the screws!,I like the table. I have the other tables that go with this series. But the plastic bag that holds the screws was empty. Searching through the box through shipping paper and such I found only three. I Like the table it will make a nice plant stand but I am missing a nut and screw. Lesson learned don't wait months to try out your product. I bought this months ago and waited till spring only to find it incomplete. The table is very nice just the quaility control wasn't there.
2,"""Just Awful but something keeps you tuned in""","I bought this for $3.00 at a drug store here in Chicago. Basically, I bought it because it had Jayne Mansfield and Phyllis Diller. I did enjoy the singing and dance numbers even if a few of the songs were just plain bad! The kids looked great and appeared to be having a fun time. It's just 78 min. of one vignette type of scene after another.It did do something positive for me, that is, it helped me fall asleep nocturnal creature that I am. If you like odd beach party flicks, but not the Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello franchise this movie is for you. This had a hint of John Water's brand of wry humor but more of an innocent vain; as I am a major John Waters fan- and Russ Meyer too!Julius-Allan HernandezChicago,Il."
3,For Camp Fun: The Fat Spy,"Unbelievable bad movie. However, movie is so unintentionally funny it is a must for people to see. The funniest member of the cast is not Jack Leonard, Jayne Mansfield or Phyllis Diller but Lauree Berger as one of the miscast teenagers with her awful singing and smerky dancing. Jayne Mansfield is cute as a modern day Daisy Mae trying to get Jack Leonard to marry her. Phyllis Diller is also amusing as Camille Salamander. Jack Leonard does well in dual roles. So, if you appreciate bad movies then see this one. Everyone do the Turtle."
1,Take Me to your Greenhouse Baby,"This film is a bunch of disjointed skits. Thy try too hard to be campy; however with not enough lead and no finish each disjointed sketch just leaves you wanting. There are a few made-up ersatz songs and Jayne Mansfield's accoutrements; aside from those everything else is flat.There are a few personalities but they never shine:Phyllis Diller (fully clothed)Brian Donlevy (storms the beach)Jayne Mansfield (always points north)The Wild Ones (People Sure Act Strange)The introductory song was the best part of the film.A final thought ""Love is a rose, but you better not pick it"""
1,"""The Fat Nothing""","Horrible movie, only worth watching if you are a Jayne Mansfield or Phyllis Diller fan. Movie looks like it was cheaply filmed and only uses about 4 scenes in entire movie. However, if you like cartoons, than you might like this movie. The singer Laurie Berger is the funniest when she sings and dances her solo. Save your money for a fast food burger."
1,Terrible,"I watched this because I heard Phyllis Diller died today, and I wanted to watch something in her memory. I've already seen ""Goodnight We Love You"" many times, so I figured I'd watch this. Bad mistake. Though ""the worse movie in the world"" is a bit over the top, this movie is SO far beneath her talent that it's not even palatable. I am sad she's in this awful movie. It's so boring.. I just kept waiting for SOMETHING to happen.. anything! Phyllis is great, but I wish she wasn't in this poor excuse for a film. Thumbs down.And, I agree: Amazon should let us give turkeys like this 0 stars."
1,Not Satisfied,I am not satisfied with PaloAlto's Business Plan Pro or customer support. I am using Business Plan Pro in a Windows environment. I am running into many bugs. I list some of the problems here so that you can carefully consider if PaloAlto is the software for you.a. Charts formats change without rhyme or reason and there is no way to correct the changes.b. The later versions of Business Plan Pro are not backwards compatible. This means that version 5.0 cannot read my 3.0 plans. PaloAlto charges $29.50 to make 3.0 plans compatible with version 5.0!c. PaloAlto will not support version 3.0 even though it is copyrighted as recently as 1998 and was sold up until late 1999. How long will 2002 be supported?
4,Master Planning,"Palo Alto Software has taken a complex function and made it relatively easy, even for a novice, to follow. By using the templates and information in the program, a business person can create a pretty impressive business plan from scratch rather quickly.The only drawback is that is doesn't run on all systems, so you have to be aware of what you're going to use it on before purchase. And, it's RAM intensive, with a lot of window-painting.Definitely worth the purchase price."
2,Light-weight,"If you're a beginner then this is your product although a very slow-running product with some bugs. It gets your thoughts together and coaches you through each section.There are a number of compatibility issues with their charts and Word export. Formating is locked and you are forced to reformat your complete document with new styles. Don't even think that you can use any templates like the Word standards. Charts allow some row to be added but that crashes occationally. Certain rows are locked and data that feeds cells is not clear about where it comes from.The other Research Data they provide is bogus. Industry insight information is horrible and not even close. When I called to get an explanation, the companay passed me onto the research company which in turn got me in touch with a newbie that had no idea and made up a description of the data."
5,Great product for the price,"After spending some time reviewing various software packages for preparing business plans, I settled on this one. I think this is a wonderful piece of software that is far superior to the rest on the market. It's exceptionally easy to use, and the look of the plan is great.I can't claim, as of yet, that I've used a generated business plan to seek VC funding but I'm certain that I won't be rejected on the merits of the ""look"" of the document. I guess that puts all the weight on my shoulders to write good content. But then again that's the point isn't it!"
1,Don't Bother,"To start a business, you DO need a business plan. You DON'T need this software.I bought the boxed version Business Plan Pro and found it to be a waste of money. The best thing about it was the outline of the plan itself, which was a checklist of the elements that make up a good plan. The software, however, was difficult to use, and seemed oriented toward manufacturing businesses rather than service businesses. The book that came with the package was ok, but similar books can be found at the library. Save the bucks and put them into your start-up fund."
5,Business Planning Made Easier,"Business Plan Pro 2002 offered me everything that I was looking for to create a business plan.This dynamic wizard-driven experience has the most extensive library of sample plans that I have ever seen. I selected a plan that best matched my business concept (and there is a very cool tool to help with that) and the wizards stepped me through the process. After I put in my sales and expense numbers in, the calculations were done for me complete with all of the expected pro-forma statements. It could not have been any easier and the plan looked incredible--better than I could have ever done on my own.Business Plan Pro 2002 saved me hours and, at this price, I got my money's worth and more."
1,Did Not Care For.,"My favorite mystery reading is by authors of the 1800's. They were the days of authors who could definitely write, not at all liketoday's so called writers(Micheal Connolly is probably the best).I had heard of Zangwill but had never read any of his writings.This one when it began I was intrigued; a real mystery..lockedroom then it begans to meander into labor relations, etc. of theperiod occasionally inserting something about the crime thenback again to other things. Angwill is sometimes amusing in thenames and description of his characters such as, Mrs. Drabdump.Another character was, Peter Crowl who evidently wanted to knoweverything about everything from the Bible on. This is a description of Peter Crowl: Crowl was a thinker or thought hewas which seems to involve original thinking' his hair thinningrapidly at the top as his brain was struggling to get as near aspossible o the realities of things. I am probably the only onewho couldnt quite get a grab on things.."
3,Nice debut...,"Nice debut album, with some cuts that have held up well... The cover of Smokey's You've Really Got A Hold On Me is the real gem on this release for me!"
5,Yeah!,"This is a quick review of the 2013 Rock Candy remasters of Eddie money's first four albums. This self-titled disc was his first album. Yes, these remasters sound killer! What more can I say about this particular disc?"
5,"AWESOME!!!...REALLY, REALLY GOOD!!!","Ok guys...this soundtrack is REALLY GOOD...it's very complete, there are two CDs,the music is awesome, because first they last about three or five minutes, not all of them but the music from the stages, and If you like the music from Castlevania, and it comes with a very nice booklet about 10 or 12 pages more or less, but it's a little thick... with illustrations from the main characters, also you'll hear sounds that are strange, I didn't hear some sounds in the game but they're here...I highly recommend this soundtrack, buy it!!! you won't regret it."
1,Problems,I don't normally write reviews unless pleased or disappointed. In this case - disappointment. We ordered 2 sticks and tested on 5 machines. In each case it showed up as 128 meg.This product (both sticks) are defective so we returned to Amazon. I would suggest using a name brand
1,Junk...complete junk.,"I've never had anything this cheap in my life. Any normal amount of pressure that you might exert on these handles and the blades will break off. Yep, that cheap."
3,Needs more points of articulation.,"I ordered this action figure because of the relatively good price compared to other Star Wars action figures. Just a tad over $5 with 2 day shipping, if you have amazon prime, which is a great deal. It's hard to tell from the pictures but the articulation on this figure is as follows: the legs go back and forth, the arms go back and forth, the arms rotate just above the elbows, the waist rotates, and the head rotates. I wish the arms could bend at the elbows, but it does not and so is stuck in the bent position. The gun seems to be glued on the hand as well. It is pretty well proportioned and the detail is nice. I'll post some pics later."
1,I HAVE NOT YET PURCHASED THIS ITEM,"THIS ITEM IS AT PRESENT IN MY WISH LIST . I HAVE NOT YET PURCHASED IT , THEREFORE , I CAN'T RATE THIS ITEM"
5,A movie for any Bergman fan,"When I saw the film, I was just stunned. What a great film! Full of deepness, thinking cinema. A great background plot, in a basic escenary, with just three actors, and just one place. I recomend this movie to any Bergman fan, and maybe not just them, also to any film lover."
3,"Not bad, fits perfect, only problem is, it collects a lot of finger print","Not bad, fits perfect, only problem is, it collects a lot of finger print all over it, the screen on my Note II never looked like this before I installed the screen protector, I have to clean the screen multiple times a day now."
4,"Not what I expected, but still good","I had previously purchased a BoxWave Matte screen protector for my Galaxy Note I ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006H0IJ5A/ ), which I loved, and when I upgrade to a Galaxy II, I went looking for the exact same product, from the exact same brand. What I got wasn't a true matte screen protector, not in the sense of the previous one, but still, it protects the screen and is very durable, and has no ill effect on the touch and pen capabilities of the phone. It's just shinier - not as shiny as a non-matte screen protector - but so much shinier than the one I got before for the Galaxy Note that it is the ONLY thing I can say I miss from it."
1,Useless product,"This product is impossible to use. My husband (the installer) said that every time he tried to pull the top layer off, it would pull the protector right back off the phone. Don't waste your money like we did. This is a useless product."
5,Another great one,"Alot of very well-done songs. My favorite is a ""Man Of My Word"", and this is definitely one of Collin's best albums. I am a ""Man Of My Word"", definitely get this one!"
5,Collin Raye,I had this on a cassette. I love it. It came quickly and in mint condition. (I need four more words.)
3,Good selection,"This is an enjoyable set. Its main virtue is the inclusion of many less well-known marches that are unavailable on other recordings. I was told that ""Daughters of Texas"" and ""Belle of Chicago"" were played at the Obama inauguration by the Marine Band. (For the disappointed reviewer ""Stars and Stripes does appear on Volume II.) The performances are not quite up to the standard of some other bands. I find the bass drum annoyingly obtrusive. For the more familiar marches I recommend ""Fennell conducts Sousa"" and Fennell conducts ""Hands across the Sea."""
4,Wild beer,"great book, and picks up where lambic left off. lamic is dated, and now you can buy mixed cultures, and therefore alot of its info is perhaps not useful. wild brews really takes it from there though. great discussions about how all beers were once wild and about how its the aging in wood that innoculates them. perhaps more attention on how to produce lambic at home would be useful to the small brewer, and perhaps some alternatives, like wort and mash souring (so as to get wild character without contaminating your equiptment) would be nice. very good though and worth buying if you brew these."
5,BLESS YOU MARTIN,"We saw Martin speak in Ashland, Oregon, and bought his books. they are nectar foods for the soul. nothing else like his writing, he will transport you with language to a place in your brain beyond language. Savory, delicious, honest, wildly reverent. but it and read it. then quit your job."
5,A glimpse of a loving and healthy world,"Prechtel's retelling of his life as a part of a society based on ancient tribal traditions. It gives a rare glimpse of mankind caring for its own. A tale of a culture striving for health and balance between neighbors, generations, mankind and nature. It is a beautiful tale of human beauty dashed by the motion of time in the hands of modern man. As sad as it is to see the outcome I find these people living within me as a reminder of what society can accomplish when it is rooted in respect, dignity and love."
4,Jujjuj Tijaax,Martin Prechel need to get in contact with the alive members of the music group Juljuj Tijaax to write and outspread the story. Especially Diego Tiney.
1,Many errors - Unreadable,"This book has many errors.I lose a lot of time in order to find the errors than to read it.Also it does not exist constantly in what is written, I have the impression that it is notes from different persons.All the graphs and figures have very low quality"
3,Missing dance tracks,"As is typical with the 1960's original Broadway cast recordings, they were edited for LP format and much of the material was cut. I was hoping with the remastering they would put more of the music on the CD. Alas, such is not the case. Boo!!!!"
3,Adequate though unremarkable recording of the score,"The only reason to prefer this version over the sumptuous film soundtrack is the voice of Barbara Cook in her Tony Award winning role as Marian. For the rest it sounds tinny with poor orchestrations and a rushed, unformed performance from Robert Preston. Stick with the superior soundtrack."
3,Where'd all the music go?,"That's odd. There was music here the last time I saw this broadway. I guess some of it was too good to be on this CD. That's right! I mean, who wants to listen to the ballet sequences in Marian, the Librarian and Shipoopi? Who wants to hear the Entracte at the beginning of act 2? WHO IN THE WORLD WOULD WANT TO HEAR ANY OF THE SCENE CHANGE MUSIC? You know what, I WOULD! But it's not here! There was a little more music in the new recording, but it is still not all there. But of course every one of the people cast in their roles was cast accordingly. The boy's lisp was very funny. I imagine he has to produce a large amount of saliva to produce such as drooly and spity sound from his mouth. Robert Preston was good (what else is new). The barbor shop quartet beat out the one in the new recording by a loooooong shot. The recording quality is good, and there's a cute little book to go along with the CD."
4,A duet of talent!,"Cook and Preston sing lovely in ""Till There Was You."" Plus the cast including David Burns and the Buffalo Bills provides entertainment. Pick up this copy because the sound is better than on the first issue."
4,"While not the best, Willson's score is a definite must!","Robert Preston sounds great, just like in the theater! The orchestra is fine and there's no reason to complain! Cook is fantastic in tunes like ""Till There Was You."" All in all, this album should be near the top of everyone's collection!"
3,Great movie packed with action and comedy.,"To my opinion this was a hugely exciting movie with just one or two unrealistic scene. Ajay Devgan in a serious role does a great performance.The movie has a good script about a Hospital with a few corrupt Doctors led by the man in charge Suresh Oberoi, who kills the poorer people and takes out their organs and sells them for the richer customers. Suhaag does have some breath taking amazing scenes which include Dalip Tahil using a Chain saw on Ajay Devgan and Ajay and Akshay using Dalips corpse as a witness in court. Sounds daft but has been executed tremondously.All in all Suhaag is a true blue everything-but-the-kitchen-sink BW romp through comedy, danger, violence, horror, I-love-Mom, prison & court room drama, and romance."
4,Hip Roc Soul is just that and then some,Great cd # 4 I just Wanna I've bet I listened to 50 times.# 8 is a good one too Who Knew.I just wish they would have had more air time.They are very talented.And Que is fine!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Great at first glance,"I am an intermediate player with 15 years of experience. I agree with many others that this book looks great when you pick it up and thumb through it. However, it is very frustrating. It says practice this scale/mode/pattern over and over but doesn't give you the next step. It is written for someone who already knows these things and merely wants to brush up on technique. I have a pile of guitar books a foot high and this is still the best.....I guess :("
3,Loud again!,"First, I must credit two songs on this CD. ""Alert"" is a good high-energy song. ""Blessing"" is a fun, more traditional reggae song. Having said that, this is another CD where Sizzla disregards the spirit-filled voice we know from CD's such as Black Woman & Child and Freedom Cry. Instead he (again) looks to appeal to the rude-boys and gals with his rough loud voice. The lyrics seemed to have lost the great wisdom that was so apparent in his earlier songs. It now lurks behind his sexual references and less developed expressions of insight. Sorry Sizzla fans but I remember that beautiful (and powerful) voice before the screaming and I wait for it to be resurrected."
2,Disappointing,"I visited Cuba last year and was amazed at all the wonderful American cars, so I really wanted to enjoy this book when I bought it. It has a few great photos, such as the cover photo, but mostly the photos are pretty dull and repetitive and don't really say anything about Cuba. The text, mostly by a Cuban writer, is boring waffle with very few facts and historical data. Where are the interesting anecdotes about Ernest Hemingway, or even Fidel Castro and other famous characters and their cars? The wonderful little pocket-size book on Cuban cars by Cristina Garcia is much more interesting. I'm still waiting for a really good photo book on the subject."
1,Buyer Beware,"This is a poor quality BOOTLEG. No matter how many times these things are reported, the same sellers just keep relisting them. Shame on Amazon."
2,Not impressed,"I saw this product mentioned in a woman's magazine & hoped it would be a product to help with my brittle nails. Well, as with most nail hardeners, it only made them more brittle!"
5,The best that's out there.,"I have tried many nail hardeners, and this is by far, one of the best that's out there. My nails have been soft and brittle and I had all but given up on trying anything else until a friend of mine told me about Daby. It is easy to use, and within about three weeks my nails were absolutely fabulous. In fact, my nails have grown out so much that I am wearing a French manicure week after week.My only hesitation for this review was that demand may drive the price point up. Seriously, it's truly agreat product."
2,Daby instructions are incomplete,"The Daby ""3-pack"" I purchased for $28.00 is failing to live upto expectations. It promises to 'harden nails'. The instructionsare ""shake well; apply to fingertips over very dry polish, every day""The first application, the second application and the thirdwere unremarkable and coated the fingertips, protecting them fromfriction damage I guess. After the third, the Daby peeled off.On 2 fingertips the peel took with it small split flakes of fingernail. That's what I wanted to prevent: the flaking fingernail tips. No such luck.The Daby company needs to print a small advisory, adddressingthe following:1. If there must be a bottom layer of fresh polish every day,2. If fresh polish undercoat is not needed each day, how long should the Daby last on the fingernails?3. How often should the Daby be removed, and what should be used to remove it?4. If the Daby is peeling off all by itself, what can be done to prevent that from occuring?"
2,No Video Functions for the Download Version! Crashes!,"I bought the download version last week from individual software's official site. After using it, have the following feelings:1. whenever i click the salary finder fuction, this program crashes. Also, there are only few salary reports in this program. Much of the salary trend charts are empty.2. Users or buyers are not properly informed that the download version is without the video function which is available in the Cd version ( I was not informed about this term until i bought the download and saw the Help file in the prgram. The retail and download version both charges the same price. Why doesn't I have the video function too!?3. I wrote an email to the company asking them to explain this issue to me and have never heard from them. Bad support.4. it does not have even popular occupation resume sample like flight attendant, ticket service agent.In conclusion, mediocre + not as advertised + bad customer support. -> wasted 40 bucks"
1,Useful as a coaster,"Running this program has caused me nothing but problems. Running under ME, I could write my resume, but couldn't use the post resume online feature. When I upgraded to Windows 2000, I did a fresh install hoping to cure the problem I had running it on ME. It refuses to even run beyond the menu screen, all choices causes it to crash back to desktop. Even after installing a patch for this program, I can't get it to work under 2K.I can't recommend this software to anyone as it is too buggy to work properly."
1,You get what you pay for.,Works great with no load and as soon as I hook up my travel trailer tongue weight 900 pounds the compressor starts running and the airbags go flat. So I have to pull the fuse to make the compressor stop running.
1,They should be more honest...,"This CD compilation wasn't all that it was cracked up to be.However, I realize that taste is subjective.But my main problem with this seller and other sellers on Amazon is this: when they say the CD is in ""good"" condition, they shouldn't be promoting a CD that's full of heavy scratch marks on the entire CD. They should be more up-front and just say: this CD has a lot of scratches on the surface, buyer beware.This way they can't be asking for more money than the CD is worth.I'm sure other buyers come across these spurious promotions from sellers on Amazon quite frequently.This has been my main complaint whenever I purchase CDs on Amazon."
4,Pearl Bangle Watch,"This is a very pretty watch, however my elderly mother, for whom it was a gift, was not able to read it! Even I had some difficulty with it. It is small and the crystal covering the face does tend to distort the numbers. So, it makes a nice bracelet, but not too practical."
2,"Passable Spenser, not Worth Going out of Your Way For","I like Robert Parker's Spenser novels, and have read almost all of them. The early ones are quite good, but the ones after 1990 or so are pretty much a mixed bag.STARDUST is pretty much a by-the-numbers effort, about Spenser's attempts to bodyguard an incredibly famous TV actress, who just happens to be the most neurotic, promiscuous woman on the planet. This book is mildly funny and entertaining, but not particularly original or exciting. It doesn't help that the TV actress character isn't the least bit sympathetic. The dialogues between Spenser-Susan and Spenser-Hawk are pretty much the same old stuff Parker has written many times before.There's little in this novel you won't find in other, better Spenser books. My advice is to try those books and forget about STARDUST."
1,StarBust,"I usually enjoy the Spenser books, but ""Stardust"" was really disappointing. I didn't like the Jill character at all, so it was impossible for me to care about her and/or what happened to her. Too bad Spenser didn't walk away from this case at the get-go.Also, is anybody else sick of Susan's perfection? And the way she eats - or doesn't eat, I guess would be more correct - makes me cringe.I'll go on to the next Spenser and hope it's better than this one, and also hope that Spenser and Susan don't go to any restaurants."
2,"If you want this book, read the print, don't listen.","Robert Parker's Stardust is a good book, but Burt Reynolds never becomes Spencer, he simply stays Burt Reynolds reading a book. This is a good book, but not a good tape. Mark Felderman, Emmetsburg, Iow"
2,"Well, at least he can write","Two stars because Parker is able to write, zero for plot (what plot?) characters(Puh-leeze). I tripped over this in the library needing an easy read. What amazes me is that this was apparently a popular series in the 80's. So much for the 80's. Spenser and Susan are so superior to the rest of the human race we should all be ashamed. They are witty, they are sensitive, they are honest, they are loving, they are perfect. As a natural offshoot of this they are tiresome, they are snide, they are racist, they are class-driven in their outlook and tastes. They are, frankly, very creepy. Anyway I guess something happens in the novel, I was too sick to stay around."
1,What is the attraction to this series????,"I finally picked up a Robert Parker book after seeing this author's name and all the books he has written - takes up a whole library shelf? I don't get it. This was one of the most shallow and boring books I have every read. If it wasn't for the fact I was bored and had nothing else to read because my husband was watching football I would never have finished it. In fact it didn't - I skipped to the last 20 pages just to get it over with. The characters are boring, the plot was straight from so-so has been TV show, descriptions of Boston and surrounding areas not needed and actually took up half the writing.Why do readers like these books, I will never pick up or waste my time again - but I guess I am happy to have finally stopped wondering what it would be like to read one. Forget reading these books unless you are satisfied with run of the mill TV story lines and do not seek any kind of mental stimulation."
4,Excellent,"Another great Spencer Novel with humor and mystery. Keeps the interest and with only one more Spencer novel to read I will saddly have to find another author as good, if pooisble."
3,A less favorite rad.,"I always enjoy the repartee that is ""Spenser"", that being said this was one of my less favorite episodes.There was too much perpheral action."
4,stardust review,Parker once again writes a compeling novel that is hard to put down until you have finished reading it. Once I finished I immeadiatly ordered the next Parker novel.
3,Bad Persona,"One of the amazing things about Parker is his ability to create a great story then ruin it was a petty, mean-spirited characterization. I understand Spenser has a problem with women because he is soooo very in love with self-centered Susan; this has caused him to think she is perfect and all other women suffer in comparison (why does this seem unreal). But, and this is a big but, Parker needs to stop portraying the damsels in distress as being so trashy and unworthy of being saved. Really. Between his strange attraction to perfect Susan and his attraction and admiration of the perfect Hawk, I'm getting the impression that Spenser is in the closet. Would explain alot."
2,Stardust: Where's Burt Reynolds,The man who reads this book is not Burt Reynolds. He makes Hawk sound like Tonto of Lone Ranger fame. Read the book because the tape will make you sick.
3,The very end redeems it,"The beginning of this book is really very average Spenser, which certainly makes it enjoyable enough but not at all noteworthy. Let's see ... Susan drags Spenser into a case he doesn't really want, Spenser wisecracks and offends everyone in authority, Hawk provides trustworthy and able-bodied support ... same old, same old. The story itself isn't very compelling or interesting until the end. That's when Spenser shows us what makes him special. It's his attitude toward Jill Joyce, the care he devotes to her, and the offhanded way he delivers it (as though it's just his duty as a human being) that I found out of the ordinary and very moving."
5,"Hey, that looks like a huge container of the kind you find lollipops in...","Length:: 0:33 MinsIt's not. The product is the same 74B connector. The container looks big, but it's a mere 6.25"" H X 4"" D X 2.5"" W weighing in 15.3 Oz.I have no problem with Ideal or its products. This just goes to show how expensive these connectors are for one to adjust the project quotes accordinlty.The container looks nice, though, and it's just large enough for all 175 connectors to fit. Once you get it, though, it does not look like those many connectros would occupy something rather small."
3,Broad introduction with a lack of depth,"...so if that's what you want, then this book is for you. However, if you're using this for your first look at contract theory, you may well be disappointed (as I am). I don't credit Salanie for leaving out the technical details of the models, because he doesn't effectively convey the depth of the models in his largely intuitive treatment. I'm all for intuition and simplicity, but his book leaves me with more questions than answers after reading it.I'm browsing around on Amazon for a better book, so I thought I'd write a quick rating so that other lowly beginners like me don't make the same mistake I made in purchasing this as my only textbook.On the other hand, I suppose if you want a concise overview with the sketch of most of the important contract theory models, then this might be what you're looking for."
1,"Poor resolution, not reliable, and poor customer service","I was disappointed with the image resolution once I get over the hurdle of setting it up. Even worse is when the image capture component stopped working in less than 1 year. When I finally mananaged to get around to figure out what was really failing (why no video), it's past the 1 year warranty, and when contacting D-Link Customer Service/Support, I was told that my only option is to buy another (no repair possible). You think? I vow to NOT waste my time and money again with any D-Link product given such a rip-off experience."
1,Caveat emptor,"Having spent hundreds of dollars now on trying to make this gadget work--and the jury is still out--all I can say is, you are on YOUR OWN for installing and using this piece of equipment. The customer service kids read the manual to me over the phone, the manual I was holding in my own hand. The sales people gave me no information whatever about what is required to make this product work, that is, until after I'd bought it, with no possibility of returning it. Make sure you have a TV that accepts input, a wireless router that you can open ports to (not possible with the service I have), etc. I'm sure there will turn out to be just a few more things I don't know!So far, a real disaster."
1,Get DVC-1000 instead,"I experienced repeated problems with its wireless networkconnection: connection was dropped after 2 or 3 days.Because I have a new D-Link 2100AP, I expected smooth operation.But NO. It did not help.I called D-Link tech support but they could not figure outthe problem, except asking me to reset my DVC-1100.I returned my 2 DVC-1100 to Amazon and purchased 2 DVC-1000 (wired version) somewhere else. My DVC-1000 works fine for the last 2 weeks. I hope Amazon sells DVC-1000 directly because Amazon has a reasonable return policy and price."
1,Total Garbage,"My father and I got D-Link wireless routers and the DVC1100 so that he could see his grand-daughter grow up (we live far away). Since we got these things, they have been nothing but trouble. My father has sent his back 2 times. I have had to call tech supprt every time I have tried to use the phone (except once...that was nice). I am by no means a computer genius, but definitely know a great deal about computers in general, wireless interent, etc.I would not recommend this product to anyone!!! Definitely BEWARE!!!"
5,Excellent Product,"I have family overseas and this device allows me to communicate with them using my internet connection (both wired and wireless) and a TV. The quality of the video and audio is pretty good. The only issue is the lack of WAP in the wireless settings, but other than that is a 5 star product."
4,Affordable videoconferencing,Pros: Very good video.Cons: Sound quality is not very good.We are using several of those units for telecommuters. It is excellent to have visual conferencing capability... however frequently we disable the sound and use (Polycom) phones for voice in the US. The sound for some strange reason works fine for intercontinental connections. Adding external microphone can be helpful in some cases.
5,"THIS IS STEVE MARTIN'S BEST MOVIE EVER...#1 ""SPREAD THE WORD""","I JUST SAW CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN 2, WITH MY WIFE & 2 TEENAGE DAUGHTERS...I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS MOVIE, IT HAS ""HEART"" IT'S INCREDIBLY FUNNY, AND BRING A BOX OF KLEENEX...MY FAMILY ALSO ALL GAVE IT 5 STARS...THIS IS STEVE MARTIN'S BEST SINCE PLANES, TRAINS & AUTOMOBILES. I ALSO LIKED THIS MUCH BETTER THAN THE 1ST CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN. PLEASE GO SEE THIS MOVIE, IT'S WORTH EVERY PENNY...CAN'T WAIT FOR IT TO COME OUT ON DVD, I'LL BUY 5 COPIES..."
3,Very Corny and sometimes funny,"This movie was pretty cheesy and very predicable. If you are just looking for a decent movie that's family friendly that can be funny at times, this is a pretty good choice."
3,First one is better like usual,It is a bit trite and predictable in the beginning. Yours mine and ours is better than this one.
5,Watch it and see if you don't like the Murtaughs better than the Bakers,"Eugene Levy makes this movie. While you watch it, you'll end up laughing at all the parts he is in. Steve Martin isn't nearly as funny as Levy is in this movie. The movie attempts to get you to dislike the Murtaughs (Levy) and side with the Bakers(Martin). As you watch it, you'll find yourself thinking ""The Bakers are complete slackers and screw ups while the Murtaughs are actually smart, funny, hardworking people"". The Baker mom is a complete moron. She is the worst mother in the world. Martin is the worst father in the world. So why are we supposed to like the Bakers? I'd rather hang with the Murtaughs any day of the week. Watch and you'll agree."
3,metza metza,"This movie was not so great because it wasn't as funny as the original. The original was a ha, ha, ho, ho laugh out loud movie because it was so funny.This one gets only three stars? Why? No one really knows."
1,OMG!!!,"I'm all for family movies, just not movies that target developmentally challenged infants. If a member of your family needs the overly simplistic, under acted syrupy sweet goodness of Sesame Street then rent a Sesame Street show. And Steve Martin, how could you!When Hollywood makes movies of this ilk and Americans actually lap them up, a creepy shiver travels up my spine. Movies like this and the people that buy them answer the question of how 'we' could elect a government of corrupt, moronic, simpletons. We have a fully representative government!"
3,As entertaing as the original,I found this filma s entertaing as the original. It's a good film for the whole family but it's not a great film to win any awards but it's a perfect family film. You know your not in for a great film but you'll watch it anyways and you'll enjoy it. The story is fun but not much happneds in the hour and half. The acting is good and there are laughs and corny moments. I actually enjoyed it as much as the first to make it a good sequal and I would actually like to see a third movie.
3,Good family movie(DVD),"I bought part one a long time ago and now I just bought two.I saw it in the theater and enjoyed it but didn't bought it for a long time.I just receieved and watched. It is not incredible but from time to time, I think I will watch this film. Good as part one.The picture quality is good.Nice DVD."
1,Actually painful,"I personally feel that Steve Martin is hugely over-rated and hasn't done anything worth seeing since Planes, Trains, and Automobiles (he was carried by John Candy in that one) That being said...I guess all ""family oriented"" movies must suck now by definition. Each night I stay up late and pray that Martin will stop making these types of films. If they come out w/ the 3rd Cheaper, I will move to New Zealand and become a Pigmy.Good day"
3,"Not as good as the original, not Steve Martin's best","Not as good as the original, not Steve Martin's best. This movie is pretty much family-friendly so I would recommend it for families who want good clean fun in a movie world driven by too much violence, sex and foul language.The original movie based on the Gilbreth family ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" and its sequel ""Belles on Their Toes,"" starring Jeanne Crain and Myrna Loy is still a much better and funnier choice. Steve Martin's portrayal of Papa Gilbreth was a little too over-the-top and the writing in the movie seemed to try to be funny versus being naturally funny, which is what the original movies achieve.While I have always loved black-and-white movies, even though they were long before my time, you may not. In which case this movie is the solution. Everyone in the movie plays a believable part but I still couldn't help comparing it with the original classics."
2,Painful to finish -- funny at times.,"This was a relatively clean family movie depending on your standards.It was very predicable and goofy -- almost painful to finish.There were a few funny parts, but the adult men (fathers) are cast as the typical immature, egotistical males -- nothing like ""father bashing"" in Hollywood. In the end, the men ""come to their senses."" It seemed a bit like a flashback to life in the '80's. Probably marketing to the parents in their 30's now--they had plenty of 80's music to go along with it.I'd would have rather sort through SPAM or organize my sock drawer, but may be enjoyable to some..."
3,Cheaply Made,"When this bed came, I was very excited. My grandson did love the bed, but he grew out of it too fast. He is three. THe 8 years old must be munchkins to still fit in that bed at eight! It was very hard to put together. The screw holes were off. One of the plastic sideboards broke off already. It was too small. My grandson kept bumping his head on the plastic sideboards.Not really a good deal."
3,If it's too good to be true...,"We should have trusted our doubts when bed was priced so inexpensively and description said that it was ""painted wood"". When it arrived it was obviously plastic. We considered immediately sending it back but our son had already fallen in love with the ""Cars"" theme so we had no choice but keep it. Fortunately, bed is adequate and inexpensive enough that we will be satisfied if we get a year out of it by the time our son either grows out of the bed or gets tired of it, whichever takes place first."
3,This is a trimmer NOT a Shaver,"This product is really appropriate only for facial hair. It will not give a shave or trim that is remotely close to the skin. It will not trim shorter than about a 1/4 inch. In addition, the charge does not hold for very long. It remains charged for about 5mins. so you have to work quickly. However, you will get longer than 5 mins. of use if you used it while it remains plugged into an outlet. I would recommend it strictly as a grooming tool for facial hair."
4,love'em,"i was expecting them to be just a little bigger, but the detail is still great so i have no complaints"
3,Cable does not carry sound!,"Be careful here. Even though this cable undoubtedly gives you the best video quality, it does not carry an audio signal, there for you will have to use the optical audio cable. If you have an older reciever that doesn't have an optical input, you won't have any sound. Also if the movie or game doesn't support Dolby Digital or DTS sound there will be no signal, and therefor no sound. Be sure your system is compatible before purchasing this cable!"
1,Do not buy this cable.,"I bought this thinking it was an all-in-one S-Video/audio cable, and it isn't. It has a separate digital audio cable, a feature not many people even use. Why it's like this is beyond me, but the product description doesn't do a very good job relaying this information, and as a result I wasted my money buying this product."
5,Monster Quality,"This must have monster cable is for all the people with small tv's that arn't able to read things well playing ps2 games.This clears it all up. And for all you that have bigger tv's, this monster quality cable will enhance your quality. This also makes the DVD quality better."
3,NO Audio!!!,"First of all this cable does not carry any Audio so be careful in buying this and also check behind your t.v and look if you have (Y,CB/PB,CR/PR) or else you cant use these cables. If you do want Audio you need to buy the Monster Cable LightWave 100 Optical Digital-Audio Gaming Cable for audio but you need a AV Receiver in order to use this, but it is the only way to get sound. This cable has great picture but no audio. I recommend in getting the GL 300 with this one you can use it on the old 1900s televisions. But the Gl 400 is only for the most recent televisions made. If you want the best picture this is it but i repeat there is no audio. Dont make the same mistake i did in buying this. It wasnt really good because it has no audio so be warned."
2,Not all that,"I bought this cable and didn't notice that much of a difference. I noticed more of a difference with the S-Video cable on a different television.If you want a Monster Cable, stick to S-Video and above. Just my opinion."
5,Brings another dimension to PS2 gaming!,"The difference this cable makes is immediately and drastically apparent. It makes the deep, rumbling bass as well as the high-end sounds crystal clear and adds a whole new dimension of realism to every game or movie you play on the PS2. This clarity also makes it possible to hear the highly-detailed, more subtle background sounds that are often not distinguishable when using a normal RCA cable.The PS2 is the ultimate entertainment console in terms of multimedia quality and capabilities. It demands a cable of the highest quality to take advantage of its maximum audio performance, and the Lightwave 100 is that cable."
2,Not as great as it should be,"The cable does offer superior picture and sound quality as the product claims. There is a flaw with the cable however. For almost [money] you would expect a better connector from the cable to the PS2 system. The monster cable connector is not quite a tight enough fit which causes it to make a bad contact. The symptoms you might get are flickering on the screen and slight loss in sound or sound quality before the connection is lost without warning while playing. Not only is this annoying but it is also frustrating when you hit a tense spot in a game and then have to pause it to correct the problem. I would have expected a lot more for my money! I should mention that my PS2 is ALWAYS stationary and is not moving at all when the connection is lost. This situation while aggrivating, is not all that bad but I would recommend a different cable for anyone who has all of their A/V equipment jammed in a cabinet and cannot get to the connectors easily."
4,Great for DVD's,"Similar to the component video cables, I found that this was great for DVD's and offered little improvement in games. However, I would recommend purchasing it if you do watch movies via your PS2."
2,Why pay more?,"I know its great to buy some gear from monster cable cause its so much better right!? Wrong I own a similar cable but i paid 25% less including shipping and tax. My friend the audio expert couldn't tell the difference between my cable and and his expensive cable. So I'd save the money look on-line for Accoustic Research. Search for 'accessories' and they could be '4 less' for these cables. Like i said its not worth the money, all my cables are AR and they sound great."
1,be carefull that you know what you are buying,this yes is a great cable for you ps2 to increase the picture quality but the pitfall is it does not transmit audio signals so that means you have to buy an additional fiber optic cable for sound this is an extra exspense that in the site info about this product it does not state even though it is clearly printed on the package but we online buyers can not view the package so be sure you check into this cable and make certain it is the right one for you
1,You have to be kidding me.,"Utter waste of cash right here. you pay twice the price of the sony cable for a cable that1) has no audio output2) tends to be way too loose of a connection when plugged into the ps23) has a lot of advance shielding that does absolutely nothing (yes I have done extensive testing on it. neither sony nor monster gets interference for the most part, but when you do hit those high levels, BOTH cables get interference just as bad)Monster is nothing but a name that people seem to be way too willing to pay for. their products are decent but by no means high quality. save the cash and get the official Sony cable instead."
4,Don't forget to turn on the water!,"Unnecessary high price knocks a star off of this one, but they work just as well as the Sony ones. Luckily I got these for free."
1,Did not work,"Purchased this to get a better picture, but it did not work. Suffered from making everything green, unplugged, replugged etc. still the green tinge. Bought the Sony component cable and it works great. Maybe I got a bad one, but I have read similar complaints from other people."
2,BUYERS BEWARE!!!,"I bought this cable to hook up my Playstation 2 with a Promedia DD-5.1 (Digital Decoder). The Problem is that the cable I bought didn't produce 5.1 Dolby Digital or DTS, just stereo. Read the reviews for the X-box Lightwave 100 cable; they are the same cable except for the color. Some people maybe haven't figured it out yet because they don't use a Digital Decoder, but all they are hearing is Stereo sound. Im pretty upset because I sent my Digital Decoder back to Klipsch thinking that was the problem, but it was actually the cable. By the way the customer service at Klipsch is simply the best, they produced high quality equipment, not like over at monster cable. So beware! If you are paying big $ for a cable shouldn't it at least work or do what it say it does?"
3,Its pretty obvious that Monster writes reviews...,for their own products. I'll never buy another Monster product again. Look at these reviews you can tell most of them are made by Monster. Bunch of crooks.
2,Might be a good product if.......,Maybe Im just a rock but how are you supposed to connect your system to both a TV and a audio reciever/decoder? There is not enough play in the end to allow the video cable to go to the TV and the audio cables to go to my sound system. So after trying to slice the individual cables apart with my kbar I finally gave up and just used regular AV cables.
2,"Great cables, until one of the colors goes out!","I bought these cables, brought them home and immediatly hooked them up. I set the PS2 for component and set my TV for it as well. And it looked awesome....for about 2 weeks. Then the short in the cables caused only the blue and green colors to work making everything look creepy. It would just fade back and forth until it just stop and the TV would have all the colors washed out in green.I found that I could stick a PS2 case under the cables at the base and it went away. But sometimes someone would move the case and it would come back.I have the PStwo (Small version) and the PS2... the small version has the problem, but the large one doesnt. So dont get them if you have the small version... The large one works fine."
2,Not worth the money.,"I bought these to integrate the PS2 into my home theater.However they don't work as well as they should.The the connector on the PS2 side is very loose and will move enough to make the picture on screen useless.This isn't tragic as you can get up and fiddle with it to get the picture back.Having to do adjust your video cable everytime the system is moved (such as inserting a memory card or pulling on a controller cable)can get very annoying.I should have known better when I bought these. Monster makes very poor quality cabling as far as durability goes.I used quite a few monster products when initially wiring my home theater and had several of them fall apart on me or fail to function.Picture quality is ok but nothing spectacular.My recommendation is to just use the Sony cables.They are cheaper,you will hardly notice a difference in quality and they will not be an annoyance."
2,Not worth the money,Honestly the cables that come with the system are fine. I wasted money on this one.
1,Problems,"When my PS2 arrived, I purchased this cable and installed it. Sadly, my picture was in black and white, and the surround sound didn't not work. I called Sony, and they informed me NOT to use the Monster cable, as it was causing the problem. I removed it, and intsalled the game with the cables included and everything worked fine."
1,GameLink 400 Backordered or Recalled,"GameLink 400 Backordered or Recalled?? First let me say that the GL400 is very hard to find, and if you read Monster Cable press they would Like you to believe they sold out. Yes they just blew out the doors at 50.00 EA. I don't think so!! I found the GL400 at Frys and had to return not one but five of them because they will not stay connected in the rear of the PS2. Every other cable out there fits well so no the problem is not with my PS2."
3,"Great cable, but no visual improvements over the others","The Monster Cable Gamelink 300 is really nice. Its a great feeling, and looking cable. HOWEVER, it really doesnt improve picture quality over the cheaper svideo cables. I just bought one the monster cable and tried it out just now. Visually, there is no difference between it and the madcatz cable i owned already. I love the look and feel of this cable, it has great connectors that hug the connection ports very tightly. But again.. its not really worth it if you dont have the money to spend. I'd say save it and buy one of the other brands, such as sony, or madcatz. If you want looks, and a dam good cable.. get the monster cable. But dont expect any visual improvements."
2,"There is a noticeable difference, but not worth the [amount of money]","I got this Monster cable for my PS2 because of the Monster name. And that's just about all you'll get if you buy this set of cables to replace the ones that came with your PS2. Yes, the image quality and the sound quality are improved, but not enough to justify the [amount of money] that you'll spend for these cables. If you got money to burn, then get these cables. Else, the ones that came with your PS2 are good enough."
3,"Fine for composite, but...",Let me start by saying that Monster Cable makes fine products. Their A/V cables are the best in the business period as far as I'm concerned. That said it is really a waste of money to get this kind of cabling for Composite Video. If your TV accepts S-video or component video then I would definetly opt for the GL 300 and 400 respectively. But at this level the performance doesn't justify the cost.
4,Great for DVD's,"If you plan on watching DVD's on your PS2, then this is a very worthwhile purchase. I have a nice Sony flat screen and while this did not make a tremendous difference for gaming, the picture difference was quite evident and blew me away when watching DVD's. If you plan on using your PS2 as a DVD player, this is a good purchase."
3,"CAREFUL, READING THIS MAY SAVE YOU MONEY!!!",These cables are great but the regular RED and WHITE coded composite audio cables are not included. ...
4,If you have component on your TV get this,"If you have component inputs on your TV your likely an enthusiest who will appreciate this hi-end cable. I originally purchased the pelican S-Video at launch, and then purchased the Gamelink 400 as soon as it was available. Its was well worth the wait. Performance is very good - the colors are more defined, especially red. The reds are no long ""glowing"" but are rich and controlled. It gets 4 stars because its a little on the expensive side, but I wouldn't want any other cable. If you have the money, buy it."
4,Monster Cable Gamelink 400,need to info customer that Optical sound cable is required for sound from PS2 console.
3,Whadayamean NO AUDIO?!!,"I did my best to determine if these cables included an audio signal but found NO MENTION of audio in ANY online literature except for the following copied and pasted sentence from the Gamelink 400 description: ""Monster's advanced audio technology delivers the full sonic performance of your PS2. Your PS2 is state-of-the-art in audio quality, but its sonic performance is only as good as the cable used to connect it."" This is at least very misleading and possibly a blatant deception. It wasn't until my package arrived that I discovered the tiny half-inch box that says ""This Cable Does Not Carry an Audio Signal"". Shame on Monster Cable for this one."
5,one word...amazing,"These cables bring out the BEST in the PS2. With these cables, pictures are so clear and crisp it isn't funny. It's SO detailed that in Ridge Racer, you can see INSIDE the windows of buildings! Tekken, has fully 3D looking Backgrounds. It's amazing what simple cables can do"
3,Use with i a HD Tv,"The use of this component cable with an HD tv is not very useful. I used it with a 36"" sony Hd tv and i did not notice a difference. However the sound with an optical cable is much improved. I used that on a Pioneer Elite receiver and Klipch speakers."
1,Don't buy this POS,"After just 2 months of use, the connectors inside the 3 component cables came off. The connectors are so fragile and delicate, if you sneeze on it, it will break. STAY AWAY !!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Not recommended,"I bought these cables because I have used monster cables and been happy with them. However, after a month or so of use, there was a short in the cables near where they attach to the Playstation. We had to tape the cables to the power cord in order to get a color picture. After about a week of this, they no longer would show a color picture at all. Save your money. The cables do an incredible job while they work but are not worth the money you spend on them when they break."
5,"Not really likely, but KASPER is indeed getting better","His first cd was a major revelation and this one is even better. May be a bit more experimental, but the jaw dropping tone and phrasing remain and if anything have gotten even more ambitious. No lift musik here, but a challenging and incredibly rewarding listening experience awaits any listener prepared to LISTEN. I loved FLIPPING TIME and couldn't wait to get this. I thought with talent like this, it is bound to be a good release, but just how good is way beyond expectations. If you are into the guitar, this mans musik must be in your collection.WHAT A TALENT!!!!!"
3,good price but the fabric is not good,it's not a high quality fabric but it's good enough for a younger boy if you just need it for an occassion or 2 but I would not recommend it for something like homecoming or prom (if it still comes in that size)
3,Not th best quality.,I found the material thin and it came very wrinkled in a bag. Had a hard time ironing. Would recommend for a wedding or one time thing like I used it for because it has the whole package. Saw a better quality suit at target for about the same price without shirt & tie & vest. Would have returned it and got the target suit if I had the time.
3,Contains some good music.,"This is the second solo album from Geoff Downes. It's not a favorite album of mine, but it's still good for what it is. My favorite songs are ""Tears"" and ""The Roads of Destiny."" The latter song is sung by a woman and she does a wonderful job. Geoff Downes has different vocalists on the songs (not just one singer the whole album). There are also a couple of songs by The Buggles and one from Yes that are on here as different versions. ""Moon Under the Water"" is also on one of the Archiva albums from Asia (I like the Archiva version much better than the version on here--the keyboards sound much more interesting and I prefer John Payne's vocals than the vocals on this Vox Humana version). On the whole, this is a decent album."
4,Vox Humana Geoffrey Downes & Co,"I enjoy this CD very much - a variety of styles and singer techniques, yet retains a consistent production. The only one I don't care for is Ave Maria since it doesn't offer anything unique. Vocalists include Glenn Hughes on Video Killed the Radio Star. I took a chance with this one since I hadn't heard it before, but I like Downes previous work with Asia, GTR, and Yes. Recommended for listeners of the groups mentioned. I play this often."
2,Savage Carry Bag,"Purchased this about 6 months ago, and it served as being alright. However the bag will only last you about 6 months before the strap and the structure snaps apart. The leather strap cover will literally rip right apart from your shoulder if you use it.I was holding 2 lightweight stands, my softbox, two cables for the strobes, and the strobes light hoods. It now serves as a item to fill my corner of my room before I send it to the trash. At least my hard earn dollars, has saved another from becoming a victim of purchasing this bag. Save up and invest in the calumet brand, they are durable, and comparable to tarmac."
2,Not my favorite,This was not my favorite. I wish that this brush had a soft tip. It's really stale and rigid. I usually love Wooster products but this one needs improvement.
3,Absolutely Beautiful,I didn't read the reviews until after ordering so I was very nervous about opening the package. There were two minor cracks but the $43 price tag on this beautiful product is far less than the materials would cost to make myself.
3,Would have given 5 stars for beauty but...,"Truly gorgeous. Frame looks like dark cherry wood. Easy to hang and install with a drill and a handy husband! Lovely workmanship...but as others have reported:Cracked in five places, all small cracks and knew the risk when we ordered. We took the philosophy that if we had found it at a flea market for $50 would we buy it...the answer was yes. So glad we did. The cracks are hardly visible and then only if you are really looking or very nosy.With more care in the packing department this would have come through unscathed. Why the poor packaging?We are Amazon Prime members (save tons this way!) so shipping was zip, arrived in 3 days. Amazon gets far too much of our income --- LOL!"
3,It's nice but damaged,"I certainly received this window on 8/25/06. It came with cracks, as I expected, from reading the other views. It also was broken in the lower right. Glass remained in the box, so I will just glue it. I asked myself, while looking at the window, if I saw this at a garage sale damaged as it was, would I buy it? Answer is yes; I think it's very nice even if not perfect for the price."
3,Cracked in 4 places but beautiful,"Happy with the piece but it came cracked in 4 places: packaged in just a card board box with bubble wrap. I ordered the other one, too ""lilies"" and it was also cracked in 5 places. i fixed it by purchasing some ""fake lead"" from the craft store (made by ""Gallery Glass"") and patched it up. I didn't return them because it wasn't worth it and for that price, I expected them to be cracked.True to the colours you see online."
3,Is what it's cracked up to be!,"Like many others who have reviewed this product, I received it cracked in several places. Luckily, they are not obvious when you first look at the piece of stained glass, but do become apparent upon further inspection.Overall, for the money, it is a beautiful thing. However, the manufacturer should do something about its packaging. I am assuming the piece becomes cracked during shipment because the shipping and packaging materials are a bit flimsy."
3,On the whole an informative book,"Yes, I agree with the previous reviewers that this book is an informative light hearted romp through the world of mathematicalmodelling of one of biology's most important topics: sex. But, I am giving this book only 3 stars since I find it very irritating to be fed with mathematical equations where no attempt has ever been made to explain the various variables or even a rudimentary explanation. This is just plain show and very very detracting!"
3,Doesn't quite work,"How do you make maths sexy? Write a book about maths and sex! Trouble is, this book doesn't quite work. If you are already heavily immersed in maths and mathematical modelling, then here are some thought-provoking models that can amusingly be applied to sex. However, anyone unmathematical will see this as simply turning life experiences into a set of gobbledygook equations that add nothing to understanding, and reinforce lots of negative stereotypes about geeky maths.The author writes rather too often about her sexual past, her personal views on orgasm, etc. It would have been better if she'd avoided personalising it altogether. Maybe she thought personal sex/relationship anecdotes would be funny, but if so, it didn't work with this reader."
4,"Captivating subject, casual approach","I [heart] Ms. Cresswell's premise: relationships and sex are approachable through mathematics. However, her approach leaves me either wanting more mathematics or a more formal voice. She doesn't skimp on the formulaic jargon, but does skimp on its explanation. You're teasing us Clio! Don't be so coy. If you're going to show us the nuts and bolts of how math can uncover the secrets of relationships and sex, then show us the full monty, and give me the details. Need the info. Yeah. Anyway, the ""number of 'bonks' to successful pair bonding"" tip is worth the price of admission alone but there are other insightful and perhaps instructional tips hidden in this work as well."
1,Hawaiian music from Canada,"If you are looking to be transported to the South-Seas Paradise of Hawaii for an hour, then please don't buy this CD. I gave this CD the benefit of the doubt when I saw that it was made in Canada, and gave it a spin. Boy, was I disappointed. If you want good Hawaiian music buy IZ, Hawaiian Slack Key Masters, or many others CDs by talented Hawaiians. But don't buy this CD."
2,Screen Protect-what...,I wanted this thing for all the right reasons. Putting it on was a pain and not only that it dissorted the clarity of the screen itself. It wouldn't stay in place. My skin isn't oilier than any body else and that combined with the distored clarity only made it worse. Not something I would get in the future.
4,screen protector,Product is very helpful just be careful of the sticky side as not to get smudges on it because it will not go away
1,Dear Children of the Earth,What you all seem to miss is that this book is pushing the Earth Charter which was written in part by Mikail Gorbachev. He believes the worship of Mother Earth should replace God. He believes in nature above man. And this book is promoting this philosophy. We in America must stop being so gullible. These people want to destroy our faith in God and replace it with their worship of Mother Earth. This book stinks of the dream of Gorbachev. Who is still very much a Communist. Gorbachev stated he would like to see the Earth Charter replace the ten commandments. These people are sick and they use our innocent children to mold their minds. Man is bad in their world. A letter from Mother Earth.....come on folks wake the heck up. This is why America is crumbling. Communists know how gullible American people are and they pray on it at every chance they get.
2,a mother of a kindergartener,"This book was used in an effort to teach the kids to respect and protect nature. Unfortunately, the most impressionable message my son remarked on was ""the animals are our brothers and sisters."" This book seems to promote more a spirituality than it communicates how we can protect the environment. I agree the illustrations are striking, however, I agree with the Horn review that they overshadow a rather confused text."
4,Wonderful....,"I would recommend Schim Schimmel childrens books highly. I have several, I have given many as gifts. The art is wonderful. The story's are simple and needed to teach our children how to save their plant. How to get along with all living things."
1,This position is unmanned,"When reading all the praise of Nicholson Baker's prose, on the dust jacket, and his ability to use the English language to create a satirical edge, I expected something more substantial. Apparently, this is case of reputation leading the book. There is nothing funny (except the Bush seeking Bullets), nor ironic in the text, and satire is checked in at another hotel. One cannot feel any emotional impact the ravings of Jay, as he plots to kill the bush baby in the White House. (Although, I suspect that if Shrub could read, the book just might make him catatonic.) This really is not a novel, but a one-act play."
2,Favors tirade over Baker's usual thoughtful examinations,"Like _Vox_, this novel is merely a dialogue between two people. One who wants to assassinate Dubya and one who wants to talk him out of it. The references to current events indicate to me that this was written quickly; it shows. This is the worst novel I have read by Baker: the dialogue is sloppy and the probing of individual reasoning is lacking. While I think there are some truly fantastic and thought-provoking points (some that will anger the left and the right alike) made in this book, I feel they suffer by being mouthed by a lunatic. Less a novel than an author's reaction to a president who he abhors, _Checkpoint_, like Fahrenheit 9/11_, brings up intriguing points but allows passionate sensationalism to override careful reasoning. I fear it fails as both a novel and political criticism."
3,"Interesting Book, Interesting writing style","This was the first book I have read from Nicholas Baker, and if you haven't noticed from the other reviews, he has a writing style all his own...Very easy to read, very easy to understand, and makes you really think about some of the decisions that have been made over the past 4 years.A recommended read for the curious -- i gave it 3 stars instead of 4 because i expected more substance from a writer who previously had been so acclaimed."
2,A rare disappointment from a hugely talented writer,"I love Nicholson Baker, and I hate George W. Bush, so I figured this novel would be a ""slam dunk"" (with no apologies to the late George Tenet). Instead, it's a rather dull rehash of Sunday punditry. Worse the dialogue, especially early on in the book, rings artificial. I kept thinking, ""no one talks like that."" Baker's great talent, in my opinion, lies in his ability to take the mundane and render it fascinating. This book is quite different from others I have read by him, and it truly falls short of his immense abilities."
3,Depressing.,"When a writer with the intelligence and abilities of Nicholson Baker produces guff such as this, it makes me wonder why he bothers to be angry. Mercifully, this is a short, well stylised, book, but it achieves nothing of consequence. It's time for the rant to stop and for the ranters to write meaningfully about how to improve things."
1,Insulting to anyone who actually worked to stop Bush,"Our book club reviewed this book last night. It received the lowest rating of anything we have read. Believe me this was noteasy.The book was a rambling mess that was a cheap way to make moneyfrom the anger against Bush. My husband and I worked long andhard to try to stop his assault on the constitution and to stopthe war in Iraq. You would think that we would have liked thisbook! It was just an insulting cheap way for the author to makemoney from an important issue. POORLY WRITTEN, NO PLOT, NO CHARACTERIZATION................DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
2,Horrible and boring,"I read this in 2 hours. It's a boring, short book (in script form). There's no real fowarding of the plot, and the character are annoying. Even if you hate Bush, you wont like this book."
2,Checkpoint: A Review,"The book is about two characters: Jay and Ben. Most reviews state that the book is composed entirely of dialogue, which is true technically. But dialogue suggests an equal exchange of ideas, and really Ben's contributions serve mainly as a foil for Jay's extended anti-Bush harangue. I suppose the theme Baker's going for is that violence only begets more violence-not the most original idea, and one that's not even very well fleshed out in these 115 pages. When you take the unusual approach of building your novel entirely of spoken exchanges (really it's more like a play without stage directions), you'd better be skilled at allowing your characters to reveal themselves through their dialogue, and Baker barely even tries. There's little here besides a dense barrage of disorganized political factoids. The effect is like reading a drunken Op-Ed piece."
2,At Least It Was a Short Read!,"A poor excuse for a book. Two people discuss assassination of the president as the culmination of feelings of helplessness, and of shame in having a former drunk as head of the country. There appears to be an obsession with the killing of innocents in wartime, shared by both of the characters in the novella, but there was no reference in the killing of American innocents on 9/11. If there was a point to make, I must have missed it."
1,Seething Fury,Why didn't Nicholson write a book when he had the powerless seething fury many Americans felt when President Clinton decided to take the nation to war.
3,"A novel in dialogue, subtle and funny","The is a sparse novel concentrating on two characters political conversation regarding the current regime. One of the protagonists wishes to kill the president. It is of course, a half-baked vague plan that is more to get attention and further one's egotism than a serious plot. This is the brilliance of the book that so many miss out on. The subtlety of the characterizations are brilliant. Like most people speaking about politics, some of the points are valid, others begin to drift into far fetched conspiracy theories. Baker walks the line brilliantly: he presents us with a character who we all meet in our everyday life. The language used and the forcefullness of the emotions are foregrounded, asserting a brilliant parody of armchair foreign policy theororists; if such a thing exists."
3,The Debate Wages On,"""Checkpoint"" is a political argument disguised as a book. No descriptive prose, no description at all actually, simply a scripted conversation in a hotel room between two friends, Jay & Ben. At the very start Jay informs Ben he is planning to assassinate President George Bush for the war atrocities in Iraq.Your reaction to the book will probably be influenced by your own opinion of whether you think Bush and his administration were wrong to invade Iraq. I don't know if anything new is shed in the course of the argument that hasn't already been said beyond a theory of why abortion should be outlawed. However, the book is interesting at the very least as an emotional response to what many people think is a wrong and terrible war."
2,I am all for saving a tree but...,"This movie is sooooo slow and boring. I thought an ""environmental thriller"" would be a little different and a bit interresting but I was mistaken. The actors even look and sound bored with the storyline as well as their roles. I have seen films by Kiyoshi Kurosawa and have found them enjoyable...until this one...So a cop wants to help an environmentalist save a toxic tree. He must fend off evil land developers who want to destroy the tree. However, he ends up becoming obsessed with the tree and looses his job over the tree. Normally, obsession would be a little twisted but again this is rather boring.The only thrill I got out of this movie was when the end credits rolled. I made it through in one sitting without falling asleep. And the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because it did have some potential...it was just untapped."
5,Apocalyptic Japan,"An awesome movie by auteur genius, Kiyoshi Kurosawa. Think ""Princess Mononoke"" meets Kafka. Enjoy."
5,Awesome and long lasting,"Ive had these grips on my Yamaha FJR for more than a year, and despite some heavy riding, they show no signs of tear or wear. Except maybe for a slight fade in color (too slight to tell really), they are as solid as the first day I installed them. They provide good grip, and also cut down vibration. The contour makes it easy to grasp and reduce tiring of my hands on long trips. I get many approving comments from other riders."
4,Highsmith ventures into more psychological than usual .,A chilling and haunting psychological biography. thoroughly modern in its insights. A believable look at a woman sinking into madness.
2,Nothing happens,Disappointing. Very slow reading and nothing happens much.The characters are underdeveloped and boring. Towards the end I started to skip pages. One of the worst books I read during the last 10 years.
4,What a read!,"This is my first Highsmith novel, after loving her short stories. And it is fabulous! As Edith begins to crack, Highsmith never describes her physical appearance -- until a line 3/4's of the way through about having her teeth pulled! Suddenly the reader realizes this woman must look like the town loon. The book is so well written and so finely crafted that it is haunting."
5,Pioneer- Soldier with a keyring,"The Pioneer is basically a Victorinox Soldier model, with the addition of a keyring. It provides the can opener/screwdriver, large flathead screwdriver/bottle opener/prybar, reamer, and large blade. The alox-handle knives like this one have stronger backsprings and thicker tools than the cellidor-handle models. The reamer is semi-sharpened and very effective. Nice sturdy, thin knife."
2,Wonderful recording of absolutely terrible music,Well-performed and beautifully recorded performances of absolutely sixth rate music. Awful..banal..lacking any kind of inspired musical arguement.The previous reviewer mentioned that these works were a 'throwback'---I agree...throw them back.
5,Boz is so Amazing!,"I got the Boz Dvd from my close friend for my 2yr old son to watch. I sat with him to watch the Adventures of Boz that very same day. I was so taken by the way the dvd captured his attention, by the way it was demonstrated through everyday life situations.The songs contributed tremendously towards getting his attention which allowed him to finally sit through an entire movie (dvd), which is very unusal for him. He wanted to watch it over and over and over again since then. The prayer at the end of each segment is truely inspiring for any family to encourage their children to be thankful to GOD's blessings.My son knows this dvd like his prayer book. The songs are programmed in his head like a broken record and has learned everything from shapes to sharing etc just by watching the Boz.The producers of Boz should be proud. This was well executed. Your money will be well spent. I AM TRUELY A BOZ FAN."
2,An acquired taste,I did not care for the taste or texture. I was able to get rid of these by sharing them at parties.
3,Crunchies Freeze-Dried Edamame,"Won't purchase these again. Fine for adding crunch to salads. These could have used a light salt or other seasoning, then would have been a better tasting snack."
1,Freeze drying doesn't work well with soybeans...,"I really wanted to like these because I love edamame and I'm always looking for healthy snacks I can keep tucked away in my office (for afternoon 'munchy' emergencies)! I bought this along with the 'Roasted Veggies' mix of which I will review separately because I had a much better experience with those.The flavor itself isn't bad but the freeze drying technique just doesn't translate well for these soybeans. It was like popping a handfull of sponges and dry chalk into my mouth. Chewing on a bunch of these will instantly dry out your mouth and the resulting texture/mouthfeel is uncomfortable and well... unpleasant.As another reviewer suggested, these might work well as a salad topping to add extra crunchiness assuming you like crunchy salads. I might consider using them as a garnish on top of a nice hot bowl of tomato soup. I would not repurchase this item or recommend this to anyone else."
4,Freeze-Dried Veggies,"The taste and flavor was very good, however they were burned black and did not look very nice. I suspect they sold them on Amazon since we could not inspect them before buying them."
3,"The kids said no, but OK by me","I bought Crunchies Freeze-Dried Organic Peas and some other Crunchies products in hopes they would be a satisfying, healthy snack for my children. Both of my kids (ages 5 and 8) gave me the thumbs down on taste, though. Same reaction to the other dried veggies and even the dried fruits. So, my desk at work is now full of Crunchies products, and they are a nice quick snack to keep me going between meals. I recommend them for this purpose, but I think most kids will probably say no to these products given the flavor of the snacks is OK, not great."
3,Only get the Corner of the Earth singles for the Mein Vain remixes,"I will combine the reviews of all songs found on the various COTE singles into one for purposes of simplicity.CD1 in a way shows how much Jamiroquai has diverged from its funk roots. The 2 live songs Bad Girls (with Anastasia) and Titan are more like electro dance songs than anything resembling Jamiroquai. The saving grace here is the Mondo Grosso Remix of Love Foolosophy. It is a gentle acoustic version much along the lines of Girl from Ipanema. A beautiful little song and well worth the trouble to hear.CD2 provides the 2 Main Vein remixes which are terrific, the Knee Deep Classic Mix is a very funky house feel to it whereas the Deep Swings Jazzy Thumper Mix has a very upbeat ibiza feel to it with the horns.Overall 1 cd is good, the other bad so get the jewel case version which combines both onto one disc."
2,looking for other muisc by candi staton,"hello i am looking for the song by candi staton ""he sees every little tear drop you cry. please help to find it. thank you very much. Marie"
3,Good Product,"When considering buying this knife, I thought that the lockback feature and one hand opening would be selling points. However, this is not a one handed opener or closer. That kind of negates the point over a regular swiss army knife. I don't think this is more useful than my swiss army camper. The saw also catches fairly easily and doesn't cut with a forward motion. On the plus side it looks unique for a swiss army knife and it has gotten a lot of positive reviews and is standard issue for the Swiss Army so something must be good about it. In comparison, I would go with the camper, which also has the useful wine cork."
4,Good Knife,"I got this knife because it was on sale, and I saw the guy on the show ""Man vs Wild"" use it.Pros:-Very Durable (even the ring that attaches to your keychain is tough)-Enough useful tools (saw, philips head, flat head screwdrivers, bottle opener...)-Main blade size-Blades lock, one handed use (even when opening)Cons:Due to the main blade size:-It's a big knife to keep with you all the time (eats up a lot of pocket space)-(possible con but not definite) the blade is over 2.5 in long; so depending on the state you live in, you may need to get a concealed weapons permit if you want to carry this knife all the time"
5,Perfect Combination,"I've had several and this one is the best; size, lockability, blades... I love this knife!"
5,Nice knife,"I like this design. It feels sturdy, and lock blades are safer to use. Its a little heavy to carry day to day. The Swiss Army insignia is only painted on. I hope it does not wear off with use."
5,Great Survival Knife Tool,This knife is a handy size for pocket. The blade is surprisingly large and useful. High quality and nice feel. Useful screwdrivers. Good can opener. And other features. I'd want this knife if I was lost in the woods.
4,Must have in evey car,This Swiss Army Knife is a must have in every car. I love it and works real good. It's a complete and full functional unit.
4,Great Outdoor Knife,"I bought this for my son to use and it has held up to tough outdoor use, rain, mud, sawing on branches and all of the abuse a boy can toss at a knife."
4,Weak blade,"I recently purchased this knife as my first swiss army knife. I found that the main blade was very weak, when stabbed into a piece of wood the tip quickly rolled 1/8"". However, if this knife is used solely for slicing(probably what it was meant for) it would probably hold up fine. Clearly the blade is not meant for heavy duty work. If you are going camping or hunting you would definitly need a secondary larger knife. The locking mechanism is reliable, although not tight, there is some wobble which is acceptable. All around the knife is pretty good as long as you know its limits."
5,Perfect Knife - Nice Locking Serrated Blade!,"This is my second one. Hopefully some TSA employee is enjoying my first one :(I really like the serrated locking blade. It's exactly what I wanted - I think it makes using the knife much easier in my experience anyway. I've tried a bunch of the Victorinox knives and keep coming back to this one as my favorite. It feels more substantial and solid than the others - I think it's a little larger as well over 4""It just seems to have what I need and not all the extras that I honestly do not need. If I lost it again, I would buy another."
2,NOT AS ADVERTIZED,THE PIX SHOWN ON THE WEB PAGE IS NOT THE ONE THEY WERE SELLING.HOWEVER THE COMPANY MADE GOOD ON THE DEAL VERY QUICKLY.GOOD PEOPLE TO DO BUSINESS WITH.THE KNIFE IS A LOT BIGGER THAN I WANTED..BUT IT IS A WELL MADE PRODUCT.
2,Mrs. Stevens hears Mermaids Singing,"A fast read, lyrical in places, but a rather strange, dated approach to lesbian/ bisexual experiences. Not a keeper for me, already donated to Goodwill."
4,A Landmark Novel not for everybody,"Fans of May Sarton and serious literary types will love this book in which very little happens except in the mind of the narrator. It's an important book, as she was an important writer. She was also a pioneer, daring to bring lesbian characters to mainstream fiction. She risked a lot to do that and lost some of her support. As such, she is worthy of continuing popularity, but her fiction probably won't appeal to a wide audience because of its old-fasioned style. It's very lyrical, intelligent, rich, the kind of writing you read slowly and savor long. Sarton's prose is beautiful for a limited, discerning audience."
1,Disappointed,"I read ""As we are now"" as a teenager and loved it. It has lived with me for years so I was excited to find this book and hoped for a similar experience. But I'm afraid I just found it dull and self-indulgent. A writer writing about what it feels like to be a writer. This was a suffocating experience for me."
1,JUNK...JUNK...JUNK...JUNK...JUNK!!!!!!,I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO THE OTHER REVIEWER...BUT I HAD TO SEE FOR MY SELF!! DONT WASTE MONEY ON THIS..THE SANDPAPER FALLS OFF IN ABOT 45 SEC ON USE...I CANT EVEN GET A FULL MINUTE OF USE!! ONCE IT FALLS OFF..IMPOSSIBLE TO STICK BACK ON!!! YOU WOULD THINK FEIN WOULD BE ABLE TO DESIGN SOMETHING BETTER ..I WOULD HAVE RATED IT LESS THAN ZERO STARS IF GIVEN THE CHOICE..DONT BE STUPID LIKE ME !!! TRUST THE REVIEWER!!!
1,"Glued on sanding pad falls off after five minutes, waste of money total junk","I paid about 20 bucks for just two of these sanding pads, and for the price I paid I got TOTALLY ripped off. Because the glue that holds the Velcro sanding pads onto the stainless steel backing, failed after about 5 minutes of sanding, rendering them totally useless. You would think that if Fein is going to place these accessories on the market, they would make the pads so that they don't fall off after five minutes, it's embarrassing because Fein is supposed to be a high quality tool company made in Germany. I have had better quality sanders made in Taiwan sold at harbor Freight than this crap, I expect better quality tools if they are made in Germany, I guess made in Germany is not worth the price any more, looks like they are getting beat out by Tiawan."
3,"Shadows Of Knight-'Raw 'N Alive At The Celler Chicago,1966'","Just love these lost recordings of a vintage gig they sometimes master for CD release.'Raw 'N Alive...' is by no means a perfect recording,but it is of pretty decent quality.Tracks that I thought sort of stood out are ""Oh,Yeah"",""Hey Joe"",their Monkees cover ""Tomorrow's Gonna Be Another Day"",""Everybody Needs Somebody"",""Dark Side"" and the encore,you guessed it,the six minute boot stomping version of ""Gloria"".All through the band's set,vocalist Jim Sohns sounds in top form and guitarist Joe Kelley displays some good blues harp.Good to listen to on a rainy night."
4,Let's hear it for the greasers!,"Yes, this is an actual vintage live recording of The Shadows of Knight of ""Nuggets"" fame. The Shadows are best known for their smash hit cover version of Them's ""Gloria"". They were a solid blues based garage band, but they had limited success, probably mostly due to the fact that there wasn't a good songwriter in the group. What we have here is a recording of the group playing at a teen club in late 1966. The recording quality is very good, considering the age. It was taped directly from the soundboard and is in mono. The performance is good, although it gets a bit sloppy at times. Singer Jim Sohns was in good voice that night, and the rest of the band is pretty solid. This may be the ultimate vintage recording of a 1960s garage band (not that very many recordings like this exsist). Recommended to fans of ""Nuggets"" type music."
4,Helpful book,"Overall, this is a good book. The author clearly understands the connection between healthy lifestyle choices and healthy skin. His advice is good, and the book is an easy read.I agree with the reviewer who suggested getting it from the library. The author's writing style is repetitive, and I found myself skipping paragraphs or pages often. The core information provided in the book is simple and doesn't take much explanation. If you're familiar with anti-inflammatory diets, you're probably familiar with the gist of this book. If not, and you plan to strictly adhere to the author's recommendations, you may want to buy this book as a reference."
1,The ripoff prescription,"This book is nothing more than a gathering of common sense plus recipes. The author provides little more to learn on how to treat acne than what can be learned by reading a brochure at a doctors office.

2,not a 2 pack,"I'm sure the air filter works fine, but I only got a single air filter. advertisement clearly states that it is a 2 pack."
4,"Barbra Striesand becomes a Broadway Star in ""Funny Girl""","One of the treats of this Broadway Classics edition of the Original Broadway Cast ""Funny Girl"" album are David Foil's notes on the traumatic birth of this musical. Essentially composer Jules Styne wrote songs specifically for Barbra Streisand's voice despite the fact Anne Bancroft had been signed to star as Fanny Brice. Of course, Bancroft could not sing the songs, obviously written for an extremely gifted singer, and backed out of the show. The end result is a great performance in a pretty good musical. ""People"" and ""Don't Rain On My Parade"" are obvious Broadway standards, but while Streisand gets the most out of the rest of the score, it is not especially memorable. Sydney Chaplin (Charlie's son), brings nothing vocally to the role of Nick Arnstein, which means what you already know: This is Streisand's show and Streisand's album. After all, this is where the word ""buddah"" gets associated with Barbra."
3,Young Streisand,"""His Is The Music That Makes Me Dance"" is a fine song that's in the B'way version, but unfortunately didn't make it to the movie version. Buy it for the Streisand cuts, and skip the other songs."
3,Barbra is brilliant but...,"A score that's lots of fun and the overflowing talents of La Streisand make this worth owning for the Broadway fan, but the movie soundtrack may actually bring you more listening pleasure. I think this one's starting to show its age and it may be time to keep it relegated to High Schools and community theaters..."
2,Blah,It was a good recording but i found the actual songs kinda Blah. They had no spice or spunk. . . Just kinda boring.
5,My Magical Night,"In April of 1964, I flew from California to NYC to visit my great aunt. I was 20 at the time, raised in New York and later in SoCal. I was a huge fan of Streisand, having bought her first album.I told my great aunt that I wanted to see Funny Girl. We trekked from Queens to Manhattan, to the Winter Garden Theater box office where we got tickets to the next matinee show, $9.00 for seats!That afternoon, I was all a twitter. Sitting there, listening to the orchestra intro, the curtain went up, and there she was! It was fun, in the Henry Street number, she was sitting there, trying to light a match for her cigarette. Over and over she struck the match, nothing. I think she gave up, and then sang People.Goose pimples, all over me. Watching a home grown genius from my home town. I will never ever forget this experience."
3,My least favorite by an artist I love,"I am a HUGE Sinéad O'Connor fan, and I think she's one of the most underrated performers of my generation (probably due to her political/social views, which conflict with much of intolerant America). Plus--she has been a little flaky--lesbian today, pastor tomorrow, etc. Still, this album leaves me lukewarm. There are some catchy tunes like ""Vampire,"" but in general the songs sound like a singer outside her element.Sinéad's hook for me has been her ability to elicit strong emotions: pain, injustice, love, longing. This collection doesn't do this much for me."
5,Reggae's new star is born,"What a great album! You have a set of reggae songs from Bob Marley's 'War' to the classic 'Downpressor Man' sang by the most beautiful and passionate voice to ever hit the rock/pop world, the voice of Sinead. My favorite are 'Y Mas Gan' and 'Marcus Garvey', you will dance to this record! Excellent production from top to bottom. There are no fillers here just pure top notch reggae songs. Excellent for your reggae themed party.Get it now!"
5,"Authentic Roots, top studio production",Wonderful Raggae Jams with one of todays finer voices from Pop music. Highly Recommended for any Raggae fan.
5,Great Rendition,"OConnor sings beautifully, full of passion and feeling. The songs are heartfelt. as a lifelong reggae lover, I can say in no uncertain terms this is a greta album"
4,My copy was COPY-PROTECTED!!,"This is a great reggae album by Sinead, who shines at pretty much everything she does. I don't know if this is true for all copies of this CD, but mine came copy-protected, meaning that it can only be played... and not installed into iTunes etc. to be part of your collection. Great album though... and great artist!"
4,Surprise surprise ... Sinead,"I didn't realize how talented a singer she really is. Putting her past deeds behind, Sinead has talent for reggae. Downpresser Man has me shouting in the car when that track comes on."
4,sinnead o'connor in reggae,"beautiful cd if you like reggae,sinnead was quiet for a while but this is a great work,good choose of the songs, all classics in reggae and sound very nice in her soft and mellow style.check it out, you're gonna love it! cool runnings! recommended...."
3,Well Done Or Auto Pilot?,"I've been a fan of Sly& Robbies since the early 80's and a fan of Sinead's since the late 80's and they're good at what they do, maybe too good if that's possible. The Rythym Twins deliver perfect reggae but it lacks the fire the original bands brought to the songs. And Sinead sounds kind of sleepy, 'Curly Locks' in Lee Perry's hands is kind ofa funny song, Sinead misses the humor. The original deliveries of songs like 'War' and 'Untold Stories' are so strong and passionate she's trying to follow in huge deep foot steps. I can only give it 3 stars and I think I'm being generious..... Wait!!!12/25/06, ok, forget the negative comments of the above paragraph, this cd has really grown on me over the past year"
4,perfect for what it is.,"it's performed and produced like an absolute charm.however, most of the songs don't move me personally (yet) ... curly locks and downpressor man are two exceptions. maybe it's the rasta sound i don't get. her lullabies grew on me though, so this probably will too. the record is perfect for what it is, and i love that it means something to her. one thing i really appreciate about sinead is that she doesn't sell out. she sings what she wants to sing -- what's important to her and what helps her get through. her voice will always kill me, even if it's to the sound of a fart."
5,New Life To The Old School,"Say what you like about the woman, her artistry always shines. In this day and age of Britneys and Ashleys it's a pleasure to hear something honest again. This record is a sing along, feel good, rocking and swaying triumph for Sinead. Brings new life to the old school."
3,Sinéad takes us back to Jamaica,"I'm not sure how many of us congregate at the corner of Reggae and Sin'ad O'Connor, but I like loitering there. O'Connor went to Kingston, Jamaica, to record covers of 12 classic Reggae songs for this album (surprisingly not one written by patron saint of Reggae music Bob Marley). The CD may seem low-budget (no jewel case) and the promotion non-existent, but the production, by Sly Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare (Grace Jones, Patra, No Doubt), is tight. My favorite is the up-tempo horn-heavy ""Marcus Garvey""."
3,Special edition?,"Can't find any info on the before mentioned special edition with dub versions, can any one confirm this one?"
2,bland reggae remakes,"I was not at all impressed with O'Connor's latest. I had been eagerly anticipating this release because I enjoy her other music and think she is a fantastic artist. I love reggae too. But reggae remakes by a white Irish woman seem sort of washed out and funny. I think the originals of all these songs are much better than anything she is done here. Die-hard fans might still like it, but otherwise, I'd stick to my regular reggae collection."
1,"If you like reggae, dub, roots etc...STAY AWAY","If you like reggae, dub, roots etc...STAY AWAYTake one look at ""Customers who bought this title also bought:"" and you can see why this album maybe great for some. Musicians like Tracy Chapman, Kate Bush and Fiona Apple have replaced normal associations like Marcus Garvey, Peter Tosh and dare I say Bob Marley.I realize that Sinead went to great lengths to go to the original studios in Jamaica and I believe what she is trying to do is sincere in nature.Housewives and lovers of female songstresses - buy awayAs for anyone who owns any of the original artists covered - stay away.My 2 Cents"
1,NOTHING HISTORICAL,"THIS CD WILL PASS INTO OBSCURITY EXCEPT IT WON'T GO KICKING AND SCREAMING MUCH LIKE IT'S MAKER - RATHER IT WILL GO OUT WITH A WHIMPER. NOT VERY PROFOUND AS I MIGHT HAVE ANTICIPATED - MERELY LOUNGE ACT MATERIAL. LATE ADDITION TO REVIEW... I SEE I'VE UPSET MANY PEOPLE BY MY REMARKS AND AS SINEAD WOULD SAY...I AM NOT SORRY. FURTHERMORE, SINCE IT'S RELEASE, THIS CD HAS IN FACT DISAPPEARED INTO OBSCURITY AS I PREDICTED IT WOULD. THE TRUTH HURTS, DOESN'T IT?! SINEAD O CONNER IS NOT, NOR WILL SHE EVER BE AN IMPORTANT ARTIST AND IT SEEMS THAT TRYING TO GET REGGAE IS GRASPING AT STRAWS."
5,"Sound for the 50s, performances for the ages","What memories are brought back by hearing the RCA Red Seal issues on CD of the old Toscanini recordings. We now have Vol. X, &lt ; Italian Orchestral Music> 74321 72374-2). All the pieces that fill these two discs were recorded at Carnegie Hall 1949-53 with the NBC Symphony Orchestra, making for a better sonic ambiance than that afforded by the notorious studio at NBC that Toscanini seemed to prefer. The first CD gives us the three "" The Fountains of Rome, "" and "" Roman Holidays. "" The Donizetti and Verdi, two pieces by Catalani, and Ponchielli's ""Dance of the Hours."" Detractors of the Maestro will of course find inflexibility of beat here and there; I find only thrilling music thrillingly played. Of course I could wish for better sound --but I maintain that with these recordings what we have sonically is part and parcel with the charm of the performances. This is a terrific companion to Vol. IX, "" French Orchestral Music. """
1,Slither.,"Not A scary movie just plain gross and tries to shock, the exploding fat woman who keeps on and on growing until...well you know. Not really a Horror Film."
2,Please don't make a sequel!,"Taken over by alien flesh eating parasites a wholetown is wiped out by crawly red slugs that belong to a hive mind.People become just extensions of the main personality ( Grant)that travels from planet to planet.The hero and the Grant's earth wife manage to stop the infestation( for a while). Sort of a cross between different alien movies,this one is just bloody and gross when it isn'tbeing slap stick funny.Don't take you kids to see this one!"
5,Tons of fun!,"There is just so much to love about this movie! Worms, aliens, bodysnatchers, and zombies! Fun dialogue, a clever script, and the beautiful Elizabeth Banks! It's just silly enough to have fun with while still being scary enough to give you chills. I can't believe I missed it back in 2006, but am so glad to watch it now. If you need something fun and scary then this is the best way to go. I was very impressed with the acting and overall big-budget special effects. The movie might have a silly plot, but it's done very professionally which made the whole thing absolutely enjoyable. Definitely check it out!"
4,You won't look away even if you want to,"Finally catching up with ""Slither"" on DVD, I found the film to be surprisingly and pleasantly horrific, much more of a straight-up horror movie than the trailer I had seen in theaters seemed to indicate. The trailer played up the several comic ""what the heck is THAT?"" double takes by the movie's various characters as they witness the increasingly gross permutations of the creature, but I found about 90% of the movie to be just plain scary, and effectively so. Good effects, too.The DVD features a clean widescreen print, great sound, and an absolute ton of extra features. Many of those features make clear that ""Slither"" is intended as a combination homage and modern take on the classic intense/gross out horror films of the 80's (such as ""The Thing"" and ""The Fly""), so if you have a soft spot for those films, you'll likely enjoy the intensity and gross out thrills of ""Slither""."
5,HORROR/COMEDY AT IT'S BEST!,THIS MOVIE IS AS FUNNY AND SICK AS A FILM CAN GET!AS VILE AS IT MAY BE..IT IS FUN TO WATCH!IT KEEPS YOU INTERESTED THROGHOUT AND HOLDS IT'S OWN AS BOTH A COMEDY AND A HORROR PICTURE!IT'S LIKE AN OLD STYLE MONSTER MOVIE MIXED WITH AN INSANE COMEDY!MICHAEL ROOKER GIVES A GREAT PERFORMANCE!ALL IN ALL... A GREAT WAY TO PASS 90 MINS!
3,The Worm Turns,"Always amiable Nathan Fillion heads a solid but underused cast in this comedy zombie horror. There are some nice in-jokes and one-liners here, but overall the film isn't that funny. The problem is that zombie movies, for the most part, are so ridiculous as to be beyond parody. Therefore a very sharp script is required to inject humour and Gunn's isn't quite up to the mark. It's still entertaining though, and didn't leave me feeling cheated. One thing I'd like to know though is why zombies always have such poor coordination."
3,NOTHING NEW UNDER THE SUN,"2006. Written and directed by James Gunn. Nothing new under the sun in this movie that gleefully sucks up the main themes and scenes of dozens of other sci-fi/horror films, from Don Siegel'sInvasion of the Body Snatchersto the George Romero zombie flicks. Good actors though."
3,OK,"This movie was not scary at all, in the least. You could always guess what was going to happen and it had minor humor as well. The part where the wolf attacked the guy was as fake as you could get. You could actually see that the wolf was stuffed with fake marble eyes, everything was very un-realistic and looked way too fake. I have seen several movies that have a fakeness about it to an extent but this movie took the cake of them all. More than anything this movie had two or three laughs and even a times where someone was dying you couldn't help but laugh. It was like everyone that would die it would be made out to be almost comedic in a sick way. The movie was kind of slow in the beginning and then picked up pace towards the middle but still had a very awkward feel to it. I would recommend to rent this movie if anything, because it is not worth buying!"
2,"Not scary, not entertaining, not for me","Yawn. A guy has a fight with his wife goes for a walk in the woods, comes across an alien that impregnates him with slugs that threaten to wipe out a town. Too bad they didn't wipe out the film crew first so I wouldn't have been forced to watch this disaster."
2,Oh dear..,"Well, what I can say about this film is that it's better than a Sci-Fi Original Movie. However that really is damning with faint praise. This film is very formulaic, no surprises, cliched, and I imagine was a straight-to-DVD release. Unless you're a mega-Nathan Fillion fan who must see everything he's ever been in, you should skip it. There are just too many better films out there that you should never work your way down your 'must-see' list and end up at this movie. Just don't do it!"
3,Lightweight homage to numerous sci-fi and horror movies,"If you're a fan of sci-fi and horror movies, particularly those that are heavy on gore and goo, then you'll enjoy ""Slither."" It opens with a sequence straight out of ""The Blob"" - meteor crashes near a small town; icky blob of alien goo emerges - and proceeds to incorporate scenes and motifs from a wide array of old movies. Among those borrowed from are Psycho, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Night of The Living Dead, Alien, Tremors and The Exorcist. This patchwork approach to plot development results in a fairly sketchy storyline, but if you aren't too concerned with such things, ""Slither"" will keep you entertained almost continuously.A couple of warnings, though: First, there's a LOT of pretty gross splatter and gore. And second, there's a lot of rough language throughout the movie. But if these things don't bother you, and you like this genre, have at it!"
2,Formulaic and boring,"I had high hopes fro this one because of the positive reviews and the fact that Nathan Fillion stars in it. While I loved him in Firefly and Serenity, he could not save this turd of a movie. There is nothing original to the staory, just another alien invasion/zombie movie. It wasn't scary, it wasn't funny, it wasn't interesting. HD DVD picture quality was decent, but noth breathtaking. Not even worth renting."
1,Yecch,"The point of films like this is to be scary, or thought provoking, or sexy, or a blend of all 3. This was none of them. It was disgusting without drama, pathos(sympathy), excitement, or anything. The plot was that this out of this world influence would make normal people into slithering creatures. It managed to gross you out(which some audiences like, no doubt), but for adults, this movie is a bust..."
1,So so so so Bad I'm writing this review while watching it!,"This is not funny at all!It's justing screaming and violence, I'm someone who LOVES FUNNY violent shows like Happy Tree Friends but this sucks. I love the South Park humor as another disapproving reviewer said they didn't so that has nothing to do with your opinion on this film.What is the joke?I don't like any of the characters.I hate all the SUPER-UNFUNNY animal cruelty.btw am at the bit where grant has all the people attached to him.This is SO unoriginal, if you are a fan of this, well.... YOU NEED HELP! sorry.Scary Movie is a far better horror parody, it atually parodies horror where as this just does horror but badly thinking that is spoofing.I'm sorry to sound so trolling but I hated this movie and maybe I am expressing a little too much hate.Please don't flam me!"
1,one of the worst movies I have seen,"It wasn't really worth my time to watch this movie. The only good parts was some of the dialogue but other than that it was incredibly stupid...one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. If that was a horror movie, then you should call the Men In Black a horror movie too. I've seen many horror movies, and Slither is just not a horror movie."
3,Old-Fashioned 70's Fun,"It's been awhile since I reviewed a horror flick. I've been viewing films regarding education lately with my family and I haven't found any decent horror flicks that got my attention recently until I just rented this one andAn American Haunting. I plan to buy both soon.Most of the other reviewers here got it right on this one. This is a fun comedy/horror flick that would have been comfortable being released in the 1970's or even 80's. This film is lucky to have actors who know how to do this kind of film, a screen writer and director who knows how to be both funny and scary, and is confident that he can pull off this kind of unique genre.I completely enjoyed this homage to the 70's funny gorefest films of that era. Nothing great here, hence the three stars, but it is fun. It's not nearly as gross and disgusting as it could have been and nor is it as silly or dimwitted as these kinds of films typically are. It's a balanced horror film that has plenty of scares and laughs."
1,It's a rental,"Wow, I love all the ""customer"" reviews. Seems like every movie has marketers that troll customer reviews and hype up their movies. I would give it a three but with all these stellar fake reviews I'll give it a one.This one is a solid rental, nothing more. If you are expecting witty dialog and lot's of scares and commedy then you wont find it here. It's got a few of each making it worth a watch, but not paying full price. If you want my copy I donated it to the local library. You can check it out for free."
2,Unleashing a monster and killing it with a stone,"Allways the same: have a great idea, bring people to see to your movie with this idea in mind, and after a good half destroy everything you said with arbitrary rules and a small, very small, end. A shame."
2,okay..ish,"this movie was average. it was plenty gory, funny, gross, and scary. the acting could have been better. it had pretty good fx. my main problem is the way that it was put together. i thought the script could have been improved, as well as some of the main scenes. but, in my opinion, it is ok. ish."
2,Not funny or scary,"This movie was stright out bad. The acting gives it two starts since it was the only part of the movie that i can possible say good things about. The story was just plain boring, the special effects might have been good about 15-20 years ago, and the whole genre of this being horror can't be taking seriously. I heard about this being a some what scary but supposily funny. I found it to be neither.Dont even rent unless for some reason you have to see this movie.And if you hear its good start questioning who you take your movie advice from."
2,"Inaccurate ""facts""","Schwerin apparently had a unique relationship with Mahalia Jackson, one that offered him insight into her actions and motivations. Unfortunately, he had his own agenda, and it seems to have precluded him from getting to the facts. For example, he comments on Mahalia's role in Imitation of Life, and one wonders whether he ever saw the movie. His inaccuracies make the reader question passages of the book about areas of her life that are not so well known by the public. His writing is careless."
1,Not same as pictured,Totally disapointed. The connector will not fit the older Creative Zen Mico as pictured which is why I ordered it. Wasted my money.
5,A Miss Somebody,I viewed the movie Miss Nobody two times to fully understand the movie. It was enjoyable and at times quite humorous. I did not know the stars but I would like the see more movies with the starring actress.
3,greatest hits,"Ray Price gives us his all time greatest hits, but without the vibrance he had in his younger years, especially in the song crazy arms, it seems his heart just isn't in it like it once was."
5,AMAZING FIREWARE INTERFACE !!!,"Excellent product.I had many doubts in the moment to choose which audio interface to buy. Finally, I decided on Yamaha Go46, a brand recognized throughout the world by the quality of his products of audio and .... I was not wrong. Incredible in everything: solid and light construction for a laptop, extraordinarily clean sound, preamps of mics excellent, very, very low latency and sign of noise. AMAZING!!!. Highly advisable.Para los hispanos, decirles que esta interface es extraordinaria. Yamaha, es Yamaha y se nota. Sonido limpio y profesional, bajísima latencia, mínimo ruido. Excelente para audio en vivo con una laptop, ya que es muy liviana, aunque su carcaza se siente solida. En fín, muy buena elección, que comparándola con mi delta 1010LT, se la come viva. Así de sencillo."
5,I LOVE THIS CD!!!,"THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE BON JOVI CDS! ""BAD MEDICINE"" IS DEFINITELY A SONG TO TURN UP! ""I'LL BE THERE FOR YOU"" IS ONE OF HIS BEST LOVE SONGS AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FAV. OF MINE. 3 GREAT ONES THAT I ALWAYS END UP PLAYING A LOT ARE ""BORN TO BE MY BABY"", ""LIVING IN SIN"", AND ""WILD IS THE WIND"". ALL OF THESE SONGS ABSOLUTELY MAKE THIS CD! THEIR ALL ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS, THEIR UPS AND THEIR DOWNS. ""WILD IS THE WIND"" IS A REMARKABLE SONG. A GUY LOVED HIS GIRLFRIEND AND WANTED TO GIVE HER HIS ALL, BUT HIS ALL WASN'T ENOUGH FOR HER... IT'S TRULY A SONG TO PLAY OVER AND OVER. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN RELATE TO THAT. I'VE LISTENED TO THIS CD HUNDREDS OF TIMES AND OF ALL THE BON JOVI ALBUMS I HAVE, THIS ONE PROBABLY IS THE #1 GREATEST."
3,"Great CD, Poor Production","This CD is a compilation of Frenzal's early vinyl and demo material. It's all very good and most fans will enjoy it. Unfortunately, whoever manufactured this CD cranked up the bass in post-production. I downloaded it from eMusic.com, and purchased it hoping it was just their copy was fouled up, but the retail CD is the same way. I have a Frenzal 7"" that appears on this disc, and it plays without the exaggerated bass. When I play this CD in my truck, I have to turn the bass as far down as it goes -- and that's still not enough.A great way to get ahold of some earlier Frenzal material, but because of the producution flaws, don't expect to listen to it much."
4,Here & Now / You'll Be Sorry - Another Steps single!,Steps return with their 13th single - and is possably one of the most grown up and uptempo songs they've done. By having more control on the album - the group release two dance tracks 'Here & Now' / 'You'll Be Sorry' which are the most popular songs on 'Buzzz'. Still sounding like ABBA??? Yes! But with more attitude!
5,Construction worker's dinner bucket,Great cooler for a construction worker's dinner bucket. Can hold food and drinks for those 16 hour days. Also is sturdy enough to sit on when there are no stools or benches.
5,Great cooler,"This cooler does the job. It's not too big, but it fits a nice amount of drinks and a few sandwiches. Ice stays cold for a long time. I have actually found ice formed in my water bottles after being in this cooler for a few hours. It's happened several times, so I know it wasn't just a little frozen from being in the cold part of my fridge before I put it in the cooler. I love this."
4,Works well for us,"We have used this cooler for shipping water samples on ice via overnight delivery. Half gallon samples are in the coolers typically 18 hours. In summer, half the ice is melted by the time it arrives, but the water samples are still <6 degrees C upon arrival, which is what is required. I also like that the top is flat, which works nicely for stacking. 2 half gallon jugs fit great with plenty of room for ice. Lid closes very snugly, so cooler doesn't leak, but sometimes that makes it hard to open the top. Would like to see an insert tray included for small items if I were going to use it for picnics."
4,Perfect for beach or backseat!,"Was exactly what we were looking for... very sturdy... great price and delivery service. Would be nice if it had a inside tray... none-the-less, it is definitely a keeper."
3,Not one of her best...,"When I read this I thought it was ok...Usually while reading a manga, I dread it when I'm on my last pages. That means I'll have to wait for the next volume, and there's always a cliffhanger.But in this manga I couldn't wait to get finished with it. I mean I was only half way through it, by an hour. When things go slow like that I'm not enjoying it.Perhaps I don't think it's that great because I'm comparing it to her other popular series (Ayashi no Ceres, Fushigig Yugi, Alice 19th) which I do enjoy reading.And in this one, there's no magic or any sorts like that. Ah well...I'm sure her next new exciting series will be good.Some manga readers may like it, and some may not."
3,Small,"1 pound a grout really isn't that much. I only needed to fill in some areas, but I ended up going to the hardware store and buying some grout in a tube that I applied with my caulk gun and it worked much easier that smearing this."
5,Another blot on China's human rights record,"Ani Panchen, the only daughter of a Tibetan Cheiftan was looking forward to a life of contemplation after narrowly escaping an arranged marriage. However, after the invasion of Chinese Communist forces & the death of her father, Ani is compelled to carry on the wishes of her father & help lead rebel Tibetans defending their homeland.For her involvement in the resistance, Ani spends the next 21 years of her life in prison. Living from day to day with the hope that in time she will meet with his Holiness the Dalai Lama. Her courage & spirit to fight & survive are astounding. This is her testimony for all the thousands of political prisoners still being held in Chinese prisons for 'crimes' such as 'waving a Tibetan flag' or shouting for independence.This book is another blot on China's human rights record. For similar reading try 'Fire under the Snow' by Palden Gyatso."
4,Great story but poorly written,"I gave this book four stars because this book is a story that people should know. It is the true story of an amazing Tibetan woman who shows strength and courage in unimaginable situations. My problem with this book is that it is poorly written. It could have been an amazing book as well as an amazing story. ""Autobiography of a Tibetan Monk"" by Palden Gyatso is still the best I have read on the Tibetan people."
2,Fiddling with the classics,"As an old Bostonian and Cape Codder I bought this book for the sumptious cover photograph. Sadly Ms Broder suffers from the common cookbook author disease of clever fiddling with classic recipes. New England Boiled Dinner with stout, brown sugar and molasses! Made a sickly sweet mess. And my favorite, Fried Clams, made with Japanese Panko crumbs! You get the idea. Photos are great though."
1,I really wanted to like this book but....,"I purchased this book, a signed copy, on an incredible trip to beautiful Cape Cod. I really, really wanted to like this book and it does make me think of my perfect trip. But it just isn't as good as some others you could buy. I've had it five years, and I'm still rather lukewarm about it. There are better Cape Cod cookbooks out there with great food- keep looking."
1,Patio Lights,My friend has yet to receive the product even though it was ordered on May 2 and charged to my account May 7.
3,Air Lift 57215 LoadLifters,"I'm giving a 3 star rating because of the missing 3/8"" nuts, it seems to be a pattern with products today. You pay for a kit and then you have to run to the hardware to replace the missing bolts so you can complete the job.Otherwise the air spring kit seems to be of quality material and will see how they work when we go camping in September."
4,It does what they say it will.,"The only real challenge is drilling the holes in the frame, make sure you have good quality drill bits and start with a smaller pilot hole then drill the 3/8"" bolt holes. Just make sure you read the instructions before you start and leave everything loose until mounting is complete. It took me about 4 hours total and I noticed a difference immediately."
5,AIR LIFT LOAD LIFTER 5000 SYSTEM,"IT TOOK ME A LITTLE LONGER THAN THE SUGGESTED INSTALLATION TIME TO INSTALL THIS SYSTEM. IT WAS NOT REALLY DIFFICULT TO INSTALL IF YOU HAVE SOME MECHANICAL APTITUDE. THE WORST PART WAS DRILLING THROUGH THE TRUCK FRAME. IF YOU HAVE GOOD DRILL BITS, THIS IS A FAIRLY EASY TASK. ROUTING THE AIR LINES IS VERY IMPORTANT, YOU MUST KEEP THEM FROM ALL ABRASIVE CONTACTS THAT WILL WEAR A HOLE IN THEM. THE SPRINGS THEMSELVES WORK VERY WELL. I ONLY HAVE 20 PSI OF AIR IN THEM AND THAT PRESSURE STIFFENS UP MY SUSPENTION AND MAKES THE TRUCK MORE STABLE EVEN WITHOUT A LOAD. I HAVEN'T HOOKED UP TO MY 10,000 LB CAMPER YET,, BUT I AM CONFIDENT THE SYSTEM WILL MAKE A TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE IN THE STABILITY OF PULLING THE CAMPER. THE SYSTEM IS ON A 95 DODGE 3/4 TON 2 WHEEL DRIVE TRUCK."
5,Air Lift company great!,"If you have any problems, even leaks years later, please contact the company. They were great about replacing ours recently!"
2,Different Songs Inside,"I'm an avid fan of the Los Panchos. I ordered this CD twice from two different sellers but I always get the wrong CD although with the same title. I mean, the ones they send contains other songs/selections. Yes, 30 songs but it doesn't have Historia de Un Amor and Besame Mucho which is the Classic of the Los Panchos. Could anyone look into this? Does this album really exist? I just bought mine from the Amazon Sellers. I live in the PHilippines and I send them first to my brother in the US. By the time I get the CD it's been 6 months after and there's no way I could change it. For those interested in songs with authentic Spanish pronunciation and songs that are really of the Continental Spain, buy Los Churumbeles de España, it'll take you back 70 years from today. Thanks. Still Los Panchos rule!"
4,Great Read,"Took on the plane to Hawaii. It is a very typical Spencer novel, and that means it is worth the time and effort. We should all be as cool as Hawk."
3,Good but not the best in the series,"I liked the fact that the story was written from two sides (Lisa's and Spenser's). It was a bit less violent than most of Parker's other Spenser novels, but it did have the usual amount of terrific humour and wit. The ending was predictable, but all in all it was still a pretty good read."
4,Runs large,"Very cute booties for my baby. I bought them for my 4 month old - she would wear a size 1-2 according to the size chart, however, these run very large so she kicks them off. I would say the run almost two sizes to large. Still very cute and well made. We will try just tightening the Velcro."
1,Disappointed,So disappointed in these boot. They do not stay on and the velcro is cheap and keeps coming undone. Would not recommend buying.
4,Love these shoes!!,"We just received these shoes and absolutely love them. I will say something about the sizing though, My daughter wears a 5 usually, but after reading the other reviews I decided to order a 4 and they fit her perfectly! Order a size down definetely. The velcro helps them stay on. I will be ordering more!"
5,Adorable toddler shoe,"These moccasins were purchased for our 2 year old granddaughter and she loves them. They are comfortable, not binding and come in a nice color selection. The size runs about a half size big but the velcro strap style makes it okay, as well as being a safe style for her to wear on any floor, and up and down stairs. She wants to wear them all the time."
1,Sizing is wrong- couldn't get them on,"I bought these for my 5 month old daughter who is on the big side (17lbs), but listened to the reviews that said the boots sized large so to size down. I got size 1-2 and they were way too small. I think they might have fit, but I couldn't get her foot in past the back of the shoe- it's like the stitching prevents you from putting them all the way on. I'm going to return these and get the ones that have velcro on the back."
2,I love these BUT...,I was so in love with these Mocassins and very excited to receive them. They definitely do run large so order down. Once my baby actually fit the shoes I realized that her heel doesn't fit all the way down in the shoe so they fall off so easily. Since I had kept them large and waited for her to fit in them I could not return--they have never been worn. I'm actually surprised that no one else has had this problem. I am so bummed but I do love the look. It is like the stitching in the back prevents her heel sliding down all the way. It is very frustrating and I'm considering another pair with no stitching on the back but I'm afraid all Minnetonka moccassins could be ill fitting.
5,Finally a makeup that works for me,"Thanks for providing this. I finally had found a makeup that looks good on ME and doesn't feel like makeup, plus is good for my skin providing ""Active copper"" and sunscreen including zinc oxide. Then, 2 years later, I couldn't find it in any store in my area (San Diego); fortunately, I was able to purchase it online. I don't know what Neutrogena is doing, messing with a good thing like this.PS I have bought other things from ""Beautiful Perfumes"" with good results."
1,Typical creationist apologetics,"This ""reference guide"" lists the generally discredited creationist ""explanations"" of flood geology, geophysics, polystratic fossils and the other typical creationist arguments.If you are a special creation beliver don't rely on this book to refute well informed scientists, but it is sufficient for typical ""lay"" persons. That is to say, people who don't know what's wrong with it won't have answers to it. Problem is, the book itself is fact-free. Nothing in it is right. Informed lay people or scientists will have refutation for each and every argument in the book.Pretty much, it's a waste of time."
1,Bogus Shmogus.,"Yes, evolution is a theory. Yes, there is not an infinite amount of seamless and perfect evidence which could allow us to ""know"" it is ""true"". Science is not about perfect knowledge and absolutes. It is only a system of thought, experimentation, and peer review which allows us to theorize and then act upon reasonable assumptions. Zealotry in science definitely must be scorned, but the actions of a few do not invalidate the process.In my opinion, those claiming natural selection is a fraud are ignorant of the science behind genetic mutation and reproductive statistical perpetuance, lack the required mental abilities to understand it, or are extremely biased by erroneous preconceived notions. Ankerberg and Weldon may choose which one they think applies in this case."
2,"Oops, my mistake","This was absolutely not what I expected and that's probably my fault. Definitely a little strange in places. Maybe I expected ""canned Zorba""."
5,te tale of custard the dragon,"Wonderful story in verse for small children, beautifully illustrated. Very popular with my younger grandchildren. I'd like to have the other story available for them I enjoyed it too!"
4,Custard the Dragon,"Cute story about how a dragon who is usually pretty timid suddenly turns brave in order to protect his friends from a mean pirate. Not too long, good for short attention spans!!"
2,Mean spirited,"Isn't anyone else bothered by how mean the other characters are to Custard? All he wants is to be in his own little cage, safe and sound, but they all make fun of him! He is ""teased unmerciful"" and constantly taunted by the others.Even when he makes his wonderful courageous stand, the others end up belittling him!Yes, the language flows beautifully and I LOVE the description of Custard. But, typical of Nash, the mean-spiritedness of the characters overshadows everything else."
5,Custard The Dragon,"This is a wonderful, wonderful book. The story is great for kids to adults, I bought for my grandkids and myself. The illustrations are fabulous. The language is smart, smart, smart."
4,Easily watchable low budget indie,"This New York Jewish couple try breaking up, but they have a hard time of it. She's bored with their sex life, but she doesn't quite see how dependent she is on him. He's willing to go along with a 4 night a week plan, but she is the one who ultimately doesn't get what she wants. I like these low budget indie films when they work, and this one does. Watch it."
4,Impressive reproduction of these old master recordings,"I was a huge fan of the Robert Shaw Chorale and hurried out to buy the Verdi Requiem when it came out on vinyl. Over the years, it became scratched and worn, so I was delighted to find the recording on CD. The reproduction of the old master recording is good; you can even hear the wonderful point in the Dies Irae where Toscanini yells at the trumpets! I cannot comment intelligently on the Te Deum and the Cherubini Requiem because I am not familiar with them as I am with the Verdi Requiem (which I have sung). I think they sound good, though."
5,Love's Soul Expression,"This Is My Beloved IS my favorite book of poetry. Walter expresses love so completely. The true depth of love when it is real, honest and free. I absolutely love this book. I feel his words. This book has touched my heart. I've read it a few times and it can still bring tears to my eyes and evoke passion within me. I want to be loved in such a way. So deeply. I highly recommend it....especially to all hopeless romantics."
5,Reaching into my heart,"Seldom have I ran from the truth. This book-these words made me run and weep that I had never experienced such completely transforming love. I so aprreciate the opportunity to live in someone eles's joy knowing that the pain that he describes will only be his. This is the greatest writing of passion and emotions to ever be rendered on paper and every one who would love should go by here first. ""... to be loved to sleep."" The appropriateness of the thought beads sweat on my forehead."
5,A book of poetry...a journey of love,"I have just purchased my fourth copy in 30 years of this erotic collection of poems. My first book was given to me in my early twenties by a lover, wrapped in a garland of flowers, along with a book by Rod McKuen. In all these years, I have bought this book for special friends I felt would appreciate and understand the beauty and pain, the joy and dispair in the description of his journey of love and disappointment. My favored lines are those that read, ""Your words are born, not spoken. Dimensional, soft-vowelled words, palpable to the eye or to the fingertip..."" With imagination and honest desire, Walter Benton writes of his lover, transporting the reader to that place where all those who have loved have been. Buy this one for a lover or a friend...how fortunate you are if they are both the same soul."
5,A book of a different color!,"Pretty cool book! I enjoyed the perspective (from the horse's mouth so to speak) and it was a good follow-up to his first book about this amazing ride. The first book is more factual and I prefer it, but I enjoyed this one as well. It's a book to read, and re-read, and eventually pass down to the kids!"
3,standard fare.........,"average western that didn't quite meet its potential. Hated the loose ends that tend to force you to read the sequel......but I'll pass. sorry EB. I've enjoyed your other books greatly, but this one wasn't your best effort."
4,Good history of J.E.B. Stuart,I am interested in Gen. Stuart's early military career and found this to be a good start. The book gives one a good base on what Stuart's life was from his birth to his death.
4,The cavalier of the Confederacy,"Fascinating look at this inspirational and egocentric cavalry leader, this is a warts-and-all account of the genius and the failings of this hero of the Confederacy, a really good book and a very easy read... but a few more maps would have aided the understanding."
3,Fautz,"Book rather good written, but as all books of the USA shipped, the printed paper and is of rather poor quality. In Europe we are used to recieve best quality. So also after many years you still can enjoy reading."
5,Their Best Achievement So Far,"Their 1992 album KEEP THE FAITH is the most favorite Bon Jovi material I have ever encountered. It may not so as catchy as megahit SLIPPERLY WHEN WET. This album is so serious and sincere and DRY COUNTRY, over 9 minute dynamic opus is the proof of it with aggressive guitar solo interlude somewhat close to that of NEXT 100 YEARS in CRUSH album. I BELIEVE is so thrilling opening which makes my expectation for the album soar and the rest do not betray us. Commercial climax comes when you hear IN THESE ARMS and BED OF ROSES. But what a waste if you just listen to these two tracks because the other heavier and country rock flavored materials heal our souls. FEAR is a bit of Duran Duran flavored power pop stuff.Recommended for true rock lovers."
2,FUNNY,"It's funny. A band that has no ""faith"" at all, just plays cheesy / bubblegum rock, call an album ""KEEP THE FAITH"". Maybe what they meant was :""KEEP BUYING OUR RECORDS, GIRLS"""
5,Hidden masterpiece,"Keep The Faith is the album that awakened me to Bon Jovi. I can clearly remember waiting for the first track ""I Believe"" to begin and being completely taken aback at Jon Bon Jovi's soaring vocals. This album produced very successful singles such as ""Keep the Faith"" and the amazing ""Bed of Roses."" However the song found later on the album is the true masterpiece. ""I want you,"" although sounding very simple turns out to be a very poetic ballad. ""I never wanted the stars, never shot for the moon...I like them right where they are, all I wanted was you."" This song has helped me through a number of hard times in my relationships. It alone is worth the price of the CD."
4,Keepin' On,"This guy just won't go away will he. Bon Jovi continually puts out good music and finds ways to plese their fans. ""Bed Of Roses"" was the big hit off this album, but the rest of the CD is just as solid. Should please all fans of Bon Jovi and fans of late 80s-90s rock."
3,Its ok,I really wanted to like this more. Jennifer is a good instructor.I don't think I dislike the practice but the editing seemed really disjointed.
2,Intermediate or above,"This was not for me -- I wanted core and stretching. She talks fast and does things that are way above my skill level. She balances her weight on her hands with her legs sticking out in space. I did not last 10 minutes. Plus, she speaks yoga-ese so I cannot understand her. I have not smoked from the yoga pipe fully enough to find this at all enjoyable."
2,Red Hot Yoga - Vinyasa Flow with Jennifer Buergermeister,The yoga moved too fast and it was difficult to keep up. It was not relaxing. I wouldn't recommend it.
1,Poor Scholarship,"This is one of the worst texts on this subject that I have had the unfortunate circumstance to waste time reading. The author's premise is historically wrong from the outset, relying on outdated information and even older theories of Jewish history. Just because it is well written (and it is) does not mean that the actual hypothesis is sound - it most defintely is not. This is, however, an excellent text illustrating what has become an alarming trend withiin written history that is long on personal agenda and extremely short on fact.Avoid at all cost - especially since the book is so expensive!"
4,Thule 822XT,I wish Amazon would list what model this was. There are more than one. I did not buy from them because I wasnt sure if it was the 822XT. This is important because Thule also sells add ons if you want to secure more than 2 bikes.
4,everything i was looking for,Easy install; took minutes to adjust and rack my bike. Bought for a '08 Tacoma short bed and had no problems with it becoming loose when I took it on the highway. It holds my bike securely and tight. The rack has a turn-key lock system that prevents anyone from twisting it off your truck bed and running away with it when you're out riding. The fork blocks you mount your bike on allow any type of cable lock to pass through them and give you the extra security. The fork blocks do not lock so I recommend buying a good cable lock.
2,Poor Design,Had to return for refund. Item end cap secured by c clip inside. C clip popped off and no way to get it back on inside the bar. Poor construction design.
3,Ugly but Sturdy,These shoes are ugly and kinda heavy but they did the job well on ice and mud. The topmost loops that hold the laces in place cut into my legs which makes it uncomfortable. Kept my feet nice and cozy.
4,Inspiring Story,"This is a book about an inspiring, driven, committed and inovative individual. Almost a ""Steve Jobs"" of his generation. It is his story that makes this book great. I give four stars because it could have been better writen, but don't let that put you off."
3,Very good story that could be written better.,"Not a difficult read, but the author could not decide how to best present all the facts for the story. No real development about business, no real development about personality or family, no real development about contemporaries. Lots of focus on early life and then breezed through mid life and later life."
5,My favourite biography.,"If you are a Christian and you are a business owner, then you must read this book. I am moved by reading this bio, teaching you how to be the salt and the light for Jesus in this world."
3,Umm not sure...,They sent me the instructor's edition which on back said that it was not suppose to be resold. Luckily my teacher allowed me to use this book but I am not sure I can ever sell it again. Did come in the mail on time though.
3,"An OK textbook, but oddly organized.","As far as geology textbooks go, this one is pretty middle of the road. Most topics are covered in a reasonable amount of detail for an introductory class, but not too much. Many of the concepts are ""re-presented"" in later chapters as needed (the interior of the earth, for example), but in varying amounts of detail depending on the topic (so the interior of the Earth is described is less detail in the discussion of the geosphere and in more detail in the earthquakes chapter).My problem is mostly with the organization: I find that many of the topics are not covered in the chapters I would expect (for example: hotspot volcano ""traces"" appear not in the plate tectonics chapter, but in the volcanoes and deep sea chapters instead). I don't really follow the logical flow of the text, and it's made teaching a course with the book much more difficult. I don't plan to use this particular textbook again."
5,Let's understand the planet on which we live,"I bought the book for an online Earth Sciences' course.I definitely recommend it as it is clever, well writen, not that complicated, and very well illustrated.It is not only for students but also for people who want to understand how our planet functions and what the interactions are between the atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and geosphere: absolutely essential."
1,Bad access card!!!,I bought this book at its price (high price) because it claimed to bring the access card. The code for the access card was DATA0123456789 which obviously is wrong and did not work. This to me was a rip off. I am very disappointed with this purchase. Book is actually in good condition but the fact that the access card does not work makes this a rip off.
1,pleasure? More like mint toothpaste.,Feels like rubbing mint on you body feels cold and gross. Like eucalyptus lotion with cooling/hot sensation.This is more like massage oil not for the lower region at all... Not reccomending this for intended use.
1,Didn't notice a thing.,"Decided to try this stuff out because my gf thought it would help increase our fun. I don't even know what this stuff is supposed to do really. I heard stories about it burning folks to giving a good sensation. We didn't experience any of that. Matter of fact I don't even know what it did really. This stuff is slippery and it smells kind of strange. Smells like olives or some kind of plant not to mention the color of the bottle we received was green and not blue like in the picture. I mean the gel/liquid stuff inside the bottle was greenish clear. As lube I guess it's fine if you need it but we brought it for the supposed effects it offers. Only effect I found was the money deducted from my account for the purchase of this stuff. It stinks literally and it doesn't provide any sensation, and the bottle looks like some kind of weird sex toy."
2,it's lube - it smells,nothing exciting about this stuff.. it's lube. and it smells. that's about it. forgot i even ordered it until i saw i didn't write a review of it. i don't even know what i did with it. maybe threw it away. it's been a while since i ordered it. i remember it smelling bad.
5,3 in a row,"This is the 3rd in a row of great recordings from the Outlaws. Hurry Sundown is sometimes regarded as the best of them all. It is Great, there is no doubt. This band is truely the most underrated bands in the history of music. There are no better albums than the first 3 from this band. Unfortunately, the band lost its way I believe due to bad producers that tried to mold them into something they were not. Diablo Canyon is their last cd as a group and is the Outlaws best work since 1977 Hurry Sundown. Do not pass this cd up. You will rediscover what music should sound like, any in todays world, its easy to forget."
5,Eccellente seconda prova per gli Outlaws,Dopo l'ottimo disco di esordio gli Outlaws si ripresentano con questo secondo lavoro in gran forma e con una prova decisamente convincente e probabilmente più matura del disco di esordio.Raccomandato per tuti gli appassionati di country rock .
1,Very Dissapointed,"Although the band was talented, this CD was not what I expected. The Outlaws biggest hits were NOT even included in this collection. Pity."
4,Sorely Missed,"One of the most underappreciated bands of their time. Not a bad song on the album. They slid downhill once Henry Paul left, but anything before that is tremendous."
4,Good for a Kundalini Beginner,"I like how this DVD started off slow enough for beginners to keep up. Once you recognize the pace of it, it's easy to follow along when the 5 Tibetans start. I enjoyed it! The reason for only 4 stars is because, I like to sweat more during my workouts. I've been doing pilates for 5 years and was curious about Kundalini. I think I'll use it more as a cool down due to the fact that it IS a more slow and meditative workout. FUNNY COMMENT: the background music they play on the DVD is kind of addicting. I did the routine again last night and that song has been stuck in my head all day..haha"
3,A little underwhelming,"I found this dvd to be clean and simple, but lacking in substance.It's definitely suitable (in difficulty) for beginners, although I'd caution anyone who is entirely new to Yoga not to judge all of Yoga by this dvd.The breathing exercises are enjoyably challenging, but I didn't find the session to deliver head to toe, as compared to the yoga classes I've taken and other yoga dvd's I've tried.The series isn't terrible, perse, but after trying a few sessions I felt it just wasn't worth my time.I think most who are accustomed to the more common Vinyasa flow series might want to carefully consider other options before trying this one.It left me thinking, ""That's it?...."""
1,Where are the poses?,"I'm slightly inflexible, but this DVD doesn't work at all for me. It's like a workout, as opposed to stretching and posing. I don't care for it, so have ordered other DVDs. Maybe after I'm better at yoga..."
3,Disappointing,"Alright, it looks nice and soothing. But it just shows you the movements in action. This is a beginner DVD. In my opinion, it is supposed to have some features to inform you more about the yoga you are doing in a written way or even in verbal narrative as a special feature. This is directly about yoga moves and little explanations about them while you are making the moves. I didn't learn anything about why the movements that I have done will be good for my body. This DVD is so short, and makes me feel like it is only produced to gain easy money from people..."
1,Not for me...,"OK, I'm a beginner. So maybe I just don't get it. I was very distracted by her teeth/smirk/flirtatious smile or whatever that whole package is... I wasn't sure if she was trying to do yoga or some porn moves... I don't get all the positive reviews. The sterile white background, despite the flower, is too boring looking after all. It's just not for me. I really wanted to like this DVD given all the ravings about the couple... but it just didn't work."
5,Great Introductory Kundalini Practice!,"This was my second RaviAna dvd (first was Journey Through the Chakras, my #1 favorite!)and I introduced my husband to Kundalini yoga upon receipt. We both love the fluid movement, the meditation and the easy flow of the video. We are both avid cyclist, so the exercises are fantastic for loosening up our tight shoulders and hamstrings! My favorite part of this video is the Five Tibetans; I had previously been practicing them for several years as introduced to me by a friend and through the Ancient Secret to the Fountain of Youth books, but really enjoy the way Ana demostrates them in this video - it makes them much more dynamic, and really gives me a great all-around quick yoga session when I am short on time. I have shared this and the other videos with friends who have enjoyed them and gone on to purchase for their own home practices as well... I definitely recommend this DVD!!!"
2,Too ridiculous to continue,"I am admittedly not a great yogi, and perhaps I'm just not clued in enough to appreciate all of the flailing and spasms, but this video was ridiculous. After doing it once, I felt like a fool. A fool that had not even been to the gym at that. I know it is the most popular pick for yoga videos, but I will need to look elsewhere."
5,Unique poses for a fun and effective workout for beginner yoga workout,"This dvd is actually great no matter your level. It will ease you gently from a beginner level to a more proficient intermediate level. Ana & Ravi are seasoned teachers and you can really trust you are getting a safe and effective practice! What I love most about Kundalini Yoga are the unique postures. You'll see poses in this video you won't see in most of the other Yoga dvds such as alternating from up-dog to down-dog, bridge to staff, flexing hero pose, moving camel, washing machine!!! (I feel clean as fresh laundry after this one!!!) and quite a few I don't know the name of yet. I own almost all of the Ana & Ravi DVDs. Everyone of them gets regular use but I have to say that this one is one of my favorites for what it does for my back and moods!"
3,Good addition to collection,"I have several of Ravi & Ana's Kundalini Yoga DVDs so I purchased this title for some variety.First I will say that I enjoy their ""Fat Free"" DVD the best. Even though I do not like this DVD as well, it will be good for changing things up a little.There are two main sessions to this video. The first session seems geared more for the beginner and is fairly easy and relaxing. The second session is much more advanced. With some of the poses that Ana was doing in this session I was unable to get my body to cooperate. But I am definitely not an advanced practitioner in kundalini yoga so the second session was rather frustrating for me. But this is a ""beginner & beyond"" video so it will definitely be effective for a wide range of people."
2,Can't get into this!,"I've tried this dvd twice & it is definitely not for me. The main complaint for me is the breathing...it feels like I'm hyperventalating!!Ana's breathing is VERY quick but they do mention to go at your own pace. Well, I tried to keep up & I was beginning to get dizzy. I can't understand how this breathing can be beneficial. I always thought that in yoga, breathing was supposed be slow & deep.Overall I found the video to be a bit bizarre. I'm not into the spiritual part of this dvd either, with all the chanting but I guess that's my fault for not doing enough research on kundalini yoga. Some people may enjoy it but I prefer a yoga dvd without it."
3,Not for Beginners!,I bought this video for my husband. I could not believe some of the gyrations and movements. Too fast for anyone just starting out. Maybe the description needs to define this type of Yoga. Definitely not for beginners!
3,Different Experience,"This is truly a unique experience for me. I did not expect this type of yoga at all. I gave it a try due to great positive comments by most users.Positive: Unique experienceNegative:1. I got a shooting pain at the side of my inner thigh the very next day - weird feeling - it's not muscle - I think it's nerve.2. Too much uncomfortable movements - I feel as if my body is not aligned (centered) at all - I do yoga and pilates every day and I never felt this uncomfortable.3. The purpose is to rid of toxins inside your body - great concept; however, the transition is too fast.I did not really get any thing from this video but pain in my inner thigh. Each section are too long. If is completely different from what you normally know about yoga. Like most of the reviewers mentioned - you might read about kundalani yoga first prior to ordering this video."
5,very nice!,"This is just wonderful!I had my leg broken and could not work out for two month.I made my first workour in two month with this video.It is extremely inspiring, easy to follow, very positive! And after doing this workout I feel alive again!!When I ordered it, I expected more ""traditional"" yoga exercises, but it is just so much more better than I expected."
2,Exhale........deflate,"I can't say how disappointed I was with this DVD. I have practiced yoga off and on for 30 years and thought I would start my daughter off with a well reviewed program. I have practiced Hatha, Iyengar, power and hot yoga.......this Kundalini is a total yawn. It is basically a breathing yoga and not physical at all. I would not recommend this for someone who is anything more than sedentary."
1,misleading!,I'd only taken a few yoga classes and wanted a DVD that would provide the basics for me to do at home. This DVD is comprised of a very specific type of yoga that includes none of the basics I've ever seen. It's very strange and includes panting and some really odd movements. Did not like at all! A friend tried it with me and we couldn't get all the way through it.
3,Unique Yoga Video,"I ordered this video because it was the highest rated DVD on amazon. I was hoping for a more 'modern' yoga video. If you are interested in the true practice of yoga, including chakras, then you may enjoy it. I've never tried a traditional yoga practice, so the first few times I did this video it was all just very odd for me. It's growing on me and I feel good afterwards but I dont know the video is the right fit for me overall."
4,Excellent for beginners,I enjoyed doing these exercises and poses after having two babies my back is weak and bothering my a lot after i get done doing these techniques i am happy to say my back is getting better I only gave four stars because some people may have a hard time following along and be unsure if they are doing everything right but i recommend you watch it first then try it and take your time I was worried I would be unable to do the camel pose but i had no problem also I had someone watch it while I work on it and they would tell me I didn't look like I was doing it right etc. but overall I love it and plan on buying more Be Happy!
2,kundalini yoga,the cd needs to be slower if it is meant for beginners . demonstrations should be slow enough the viewer can truly follow
3,It's Ok,I thought that this was going to be a little more than just breathing exercises. But I felt that this was a good way to relax after a stressful day.
5,Rocked My World!,I start my day with this and don't know what I'd do without it. It's perfect to get your exercise in with the added bonus of yoga. It has two 25 min. sets plus a meditation. The first set is Rise & Spine. The second is the Five Tibetans. KY with Ana & Ravi is the best!
5,Perfect answer for my back,"I am a regular at the chiropractor and because of low back and leg pain had an MRI and was sent to a pain management physician. The first thing they want to do is put me on meds and do injections, THEN try P.T. I decided to take things into my own hands instead and did some research and ordered this DVD. It's only been 2 weeks but I am sleeping better, my muscles aren't so tight and have noticeably improved pain levels in my lumbo-sacral region. I've recommended it already to other friends and think it's my lifesaver to helping me take my health into my own hands and not main stream medicine's meds and injections. My husband and I are doing the exercises together and it's helping him too. I was also pleased to see the 5 Tibetans on the DVD. The DVD has a design matrix where you can lay out your own workout. Many thanks Ravi and Ana."
5,I Never Thought I'd Be a Home DVD Person,"I always thought that the way to learn yoga properly was to take a live class but I have to admit that I was wrong. Ana & Ravi's instruction is so crisp and informative, that you can basically do the workout without having to look at the screen, although you will want to in order to see Ana's perfect execution of the exercises. I have tried other Kundalini Yoga DVD's but I found them either too easy or too hard. This was just right. I am now in the process of collecting all of Ana & Ravi's workouts. They have become my good friends who I see everyone morning on my tv!"
5,It's great!,"I had not done yoga in many years, and was sort of ""afraid"" of doing anything now, let alone ""kundalini"" which I had never tried. When I first saw Ana Brett I was a little intimidated by her youth, but this was soon put to rest because she is so completely open and competent, and fun to watch. The music, suggestions, and the routines are very solid. In fact, when I use this video I sleep very soundly, compared with another yoga video I recently purchased. Thanks to Ana and Ravi for getting me started again on the right track."
2,Most Boring Video I've Ever Done,"After reading the reviews for this DVD, I was so excited when I got it. I popped it in the DVD player and prepared myself for a good yoga session. I have never been more disappointed. This has to be the most boring yoga video on the face of the planet. If you want to practice breathing and just moving your spine then this video is perfect for you. But if you want to actually do yoga, I'd suggest buying a different video."
5,Best Discovery of my LIfe!!!,"Ravi & Ana's Kundalini Yoga Beginner's & Beyond is my favorite workout! I enjoy every second of it! I practice with this tape 4-5 times a week.I mostly do Ravi & Ana workouts. They are kind of pilates-like with some aerobic aspects as well. This is a very interesting type of yoga which I find very powerful.This yoga has benefited me in so many ways - my body feels more flexible and ""lighter."" My moods have improved and I am definitely calmer.Yoga has been the best thing that's happened to me recently. I have read a lot about yoga philosophy. I have experimented with many different schools of yoga. I seem to have a special affinity towards this approach. Practicing Beginners and Beyond on a daily basis keeps me feeling vital in ways nothing else comes near. Definitely adding Ravi & Ana workouts have made a huge difference in my life. Awesome stuff!!!"
2,More meditative than expected...,"I take the blame here for not spending hours of research on my next exercise DVD, but I wanted to share my experience anyhow, in case someone else is doing their research. This DVD is highly meditative in nature, and while I don't discount it's benefits, i was looking for something different. One of my favorite DVDs is Ellen Barrett's Superslim down Yoga/Pilates blend, and I was hoping for something similar. I wanted something less ""Denise Austin"", and I saw these rave reviews, so I went with it. But it is the other end of the spectrum- too slow and quiet for me. Ellen is the perfect blend- in between."
3,Good for beginners...that's about it.,"This is the first yoga DVD I'd bought and the first time I'd done yoga. I didn't realize how unchallenging it was until I bought a new one that made me really sore for two days after trying it the first few times. This one seems to focus more on the mind/body fluffy yoga stuff. Which is fine, it's just not really my thing. I'm more interested in challenging my muscles and feeling it the next day. I'll continue to do this yoga DVD on days where I don't really feel like putting much effort in to a workout but push myself to do at least something. However I must say that this was a great way to learn the basics of yoga. I knew NOTHING about yoga before purchasing this DVD."
1,Sure didn't rock my Kundalini,"My review has been erased from this site numerous times. But after reading some other negative reviews, I am posting this again (now for the fifth time - Amazon fails to catch the perpetrator) to share my experience.I did not like this yoga video from Ana and Ravi in the slightest. The tape shows a sequence of back bending poses which are repeated in rapid succession. Yes, there are pauses in between the exercises, but the movements shown are so rapid and jerky that my back hurt after doing these moves. I had not done Kundalini yoga before, so perhaps that was the cause, but I would warn beginners to be careful while doing these poses. I do not think this is a beginner tape."
1,Not your typical yoga video,"I felt compelled to write a review because I wish so much I'd read the one-star reviews. This is simply in no way what I wanted in a yoga video. I was picturing some core work, some downward-dog, etc. This is a strange, new-agey video of breathing exercises and odd body movements. This is not a workout.It may be good for stress relief, meditation, etc, but is clearly intended for ""Kundalini"" followers, not your average gal who just wants to tone."
1,Waste of money,"There is no yoga in this DVD at all. Let me save you some time and money, Sit in the floor and convulse spastically. I am disappointed in other reviews that enticed me to waste my money. You have been warned."
4,It is very interesting and hope to use it more and more.......,I haven't used it to much yet as I am still working on a regular yoga but have played it and it is interesting...
1,Yoga?,"If you call spinning around in a circle yoga, this one is for you. I did not get anything out of this video. It was not anything like any yoga class I have ever taken. Mostly the poses were sitting and thrusting your pelvis in & out rapidly. Not a very helpful video for stretching, lengthening and strengthening my body."
5,so glad i got this!,"As a runner, i was looking for some other activity to do to ""cross-train"" and decided to try this based on the many reviews.. i'm so glad i did. I am not at all flexible and this dvd makes it easy for someone with no flexibility to follow along and do the moves.. you definitely feel it in your muscles! I also like how it is seperated by 2 parts, so you can do either one if you are pressed for time. I also own Dance the Chakras and Fat Free Yoga which are good but i think i like this one the best!"
5,WOW!,"I don't usually get caught up in hype. But I did this time and what a payoff! This Beginners and Beyond really does live up to its glowing reviews. It is great for people like me who have been resistant to yoga. This yoga is more athletic and moving then most which keeps it fun and interesting, plus the great soundtrack makes this workout a blast!I find myself craving this type of yoga now.I am on my way to purchase more of Ana & Ravi's DVDs!"
1,Awkward and boring,"Given the enthusiasm of many of the positive reviews, I was initially very excited about this DVD. However, the product did not live up to my expectations. The production quality appears poor - lighting, sound, music, etc... The movements are awkward and so repetitious to the point of boredom. I tried this video solo and with some friends whom I work out with. I thought if I tried it in a group setting that I might find it more enjoyable. None of us liked it, and we didn't even complete the DVD. It was a big disappointment, and I haven't touched it since. Overall it seemed very strange, and I'm really perplexed that so many people think it's ""great."""
5,GENIUS!!!,"There are so many ""fusion"" type yoga DVD's coming out, this one incorporates the best of both worlds, naturally. I have a Pilates background and I've always been sort of a fitness snob. When I did this one I couldn't deny that Ravi & Ana are genius. They make yoga seem easy. But I guarantee you will feel this one the next day. By the time I get to the end - I NEED that relaxation!!!!! - my muscles are shaking (in a good way) and I after, am SO relaxed! I love, love, love this DVD! I own many, many yoga/fitness DVD's. This is the best. Do your self a favor and get this one. Also, the music is some of the best I've heard on a yoga DVD."
5,Great for beginners,"I had never practiced any type of yoga before, but after starting Kundalini Yoga for Beginners & Beyond, I can feel a difference. The rise and spine series is a great way to wake up in the morning; you'll feel a difference in your body for the rest of the day. I never thought yoga would be much of a workout, but the 5 Tibetan Rites will certainly have your heart racing. I would recommend this to anyone wanting an introduction to yoga."
1,Definitely not for beginners,"There is so much wrong with this video that it would take paragraphs to describe. Just know this: I heard not one word about proper breathing while doing the movements. For me, yoga is most beneficial when done in concert with proper breathing, and I don't think I'm alone in that.. And no beginner should attempt a number of these movements. There's nothing technically wrong with the instructions in this DVD --- they're just not for beginners."
5,Can't go wrong!,Great Product...I just got into Yoga and this is a great way to start getting into it.
5,LOVE IT,"This is a great TV, it is not a big bulky monster, it has a slim cabinet, and a great picture. I am very happy with it."
1,Waste of money,"My daughter bought this. Unfortunately, the only thing it taught her is that you don't always get what you pay for.The software does not run correctly on a top of the line Vista Home Premium system with a great video card.The company offered no assistance. The patch does not work."
2,A game better for younger children,"This game is a good starter computer game for children under 7. It's a simple game, where you feed the kitty, play a game with the kitty (move a toy mouse around and the kitty tries to catch it - if the kitty fails to catch it, you get money), buy things for your kitty like food, water, and accessories like collars. It's an easy game. You pick the breed of your kitty, the gender, and you type a name for your kitty. It's not attention-grabbing, like some other games. You'd have more fun with Dogz 5 for the computer, or Nintendogs for DS, if you're older than 7. They are attention-grabbing, and they have more activities for you to do. Or, even try Puppy Luv: A New Breed - I like that one better, and it has more activities for you. Before buying any Luv games, be sure to do an hour-long free trial at some sites like www.Shockwave.com."
2,BORING!!!,All of the Luv games are BORING!!! I have downloaded and played all the games thinking each one would be better than the last. You buy stuff and train then NOTHING! There is not much to do after that. It's also hard to make them do tricks.
1,Don't Buy,"I bought the game for my daughter. I have been unable to even get the game running although I meet and or exceed the requirements. I downloaded the patches e.t.c that were available but still all I get is a message saying cannot initialize video mode. Daughter is very diappointed and hurt as to she was looking forward to being able to play this. Even though game does not work cannot even get refund since it has been opened. Not worth the hassle. (Update)-Have written the company for about the 6th time since buying, first 2 responses were to simply download the patches(which I had informed then I had already done) now I get no response at all."
1,Dont Buy It,"Got this for my daughter. First it wouldnt work at all. It was missing drivers that I had to download off thier website. Then when I finally got the program ""working"" It was very bizarre. The cat ended up absorbed into a wall - strange. None of the activities worked the way you'd think they should. I ended up with my daughter in tears and throwing the program in the trash."
1,Horrible...,"My daughter and I came across this at walmart yesterday and were very excited about it, only to come home and have it crash on us everytime we try to play it. We can not change rooms and the patch doesnt work. I am very dissapointed in this game. I should have come here first. Do not waste your money on this game."
1,Runs on limited number of computers.,"I can't actually comment in the quality of gameplay, since it was bought by my daughter. But I can speak to the problems people are having:SIMPLE RULE (for those who don't know much about their computers):THIS GAME WILL NOT PLAY ON MOST LAPTOPS, regardless of whether you have the right version of Windows. It checks for two specific families of video card - which mostly are for desktop computers.MORE COMPLEX RULE: If you know how to check your video card, you need to meet all the requirements listed on box (Windows, Memory, etc). And your video card must be by Nvidia or ATI. Anything else is suspect and unlikely to work."
1,Kitty luv does not work,"I bought this for my daughter for her birthday. She was so happy, just to be let down as it didnt work. Since I have dial up, was going to take me over 2 hours to download the patch. Forget this one. Good idea but how can you possible market something like this that doesnt work. Dont they try out thier items before the put them on the market. I'm one very angry mom."
1,Crashes!!,This game is a piece of junk!!!It doesn't work even on a computer with 256 meg video.1.2 Pentium processor 512 meg ram.It freezes up all the time and re-boots the computer.Lost s*ck games website is down and you can't contact themabout their piece of crap software
1,waste of money,"My 5 yo daughter bought this game with her own money because she loves cats and the box was pink (her favorite color). It was a complete waste of money, unfortunately. The game frequently froze and it required way too many steps to do the simplest thing. Because I felt sorry for my dd, I eventually bought her the petz: dogz 5 and cats 5 game which is a much better game and I highly recommend it as an alternative to kitty luv. I would have given this product zero stars if I could have."
1,Zero stars,"I bought this game for my niece to play while she was here. After installing it in my brand new Gateway, all that comes up is a box stating that it cannot initialize video mode.Take the $20.00 and donate it to your local animal shelter. You'll get a whole lot more satisfaction."
1,worse than bad,"I would have given this zero stars if the program had that as an option. A really, really awful game. The graphic are awful, the game does not respond to the mouse. The hot spots to click on are vague and frustrating and often full areas of the graphics are missing and there is just a black square where the picture should go. I have written tech support clearly explaing the difficulites and have received no reply, not even and form email.I too am running this on a computer that exceeds the minimun requirements. Don't waste your money and until things improve I will not be purchasing any of Game Mills products, they are really poor quality. Find something else for your 20 bucks!!"
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!,"I bought this for my daughter for her birthday. It was a real disappointment from the beginning. Ok, so the graphics are not very good but she is seven and just wanted to feed and play with her new computer kitty. Everytime she changed rooms an error would pop up. So I went to the company website, downloaded and installed the needed patch and guess what. Now she can take her cat from one room to another but anytime she trys to play with the cat using one of the toys the cat immediately goes to the right of the screen, partially disappears in to the wall, and there is no way to get out of this glitch unless you quit and restart the game. If you are a parent looking for a cute game for you child this is not the one for you. The only thing this game has been good for so far is disappointing my daughter on her birthday!!!!"
1,DOES NOT WORK! Riddled with bugs!,"I can not beleive this company even released this game. Someone must had to meet a deadline before it was complete. It doesn't work. There was no quality testing because it is riddled with bugs. And quite simply, it just does not work. You cant use the things you buy. It's just all very very odd. My daughter used a gift card to buy this - and I feel she got severely ripped off."
1,What a DISAPPOINTMENT!,My son was so excited about this game and was entirely let down! Couldn't get through more than about 2 minutes before the game crashed again and again! How can software as flawed as this be available for sale! Absolutely a tease for children- do not purchase this game.
1,Complete Garbage!!!,"Whoever put this together should be ashamed of themselves. My daughter spent birthday money to buy this at a retail store. (I should have gone online and looked at the reviews, first.) I spent an hour trying to get it to work and installing patches. The game just simply does not work. What I could get to work did not look very interesting or fun. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!"
1,This Game is garbage Don't buy it,"I bought this game at wal-mart. It isn't their fault it doesn't work. All they do is sell it, not manufacture it. I have never had this problem from any game I bought at wal-mart. I get the error 'unable to initialize video mode'. I have a brand new laptop that exceeds any requirements. I have also emailed the manufacturers and no reply. Even if the manufacture fixes this screw up, I will never buy another one of their games just for the principle of it. They recieved their money and we all got the shaft. What a way to run a business. If this review had a way to put zero stars in it I would have checked it, 1 star is way too good for this game."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!,"My daughter bought this game at Walmart with money she had saved up. The ""game"" is absolutely junk!! It freezes up constantly and gives error messages. She got so frustrated she was crying, and was extremely disappointed that she wasted her $20 on this game. We wish we had checked here for reviews first!! Hopefully we'll save someone else from wasting their money. Walmart of course would not refund the money, and contacts to the manufacturer only elicited an email with a link to the ""patch"". I think that this company should make good on their junky game by reimbursing all of us who have wasted money on such a poorly-made game. Did they not check it out first before putting it on store shelves?!"
1,I agree with the other reviews - DON'T BUY THIS GAME,"My son purchased this game at Target with his birthday money and we got an error message.I haven't tried downloading the patches yet - and Target only allows replacement, not a refund.I wish we had come here first to check the reviews."
1,They have done this in the past...,"Kitty Luv does not work for my higher-end system either (workstation class dual core 3GHz, 2GB RAM, NVidia Quadro FX1400 128MB video) even after installing the newest video driver and latest DirectX controls.The game crashes randomly. Patch v1.6 (actually installed as v1.8) takes away all functionality of the original. You can't even feed the cat! I quit before the cat died of starvation.Gamemill has released other unusable software in the past (Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing), it looks like they are doing it again.I just finished writing a letter to tech support to see what they can do."
4,Read This Book...,"I really enjoyed reading this book...Wilcox weaves buddhism, politics, and technology into a very timely (and not so far-fetched ) story. The reality of the accelerated improvements and progression of computer design and function help ground this work of science fiction, and make the scenario he presents seem all the more plausable. This present age of war, political intrigue, etc. demands that we all consider how our own actions impact others--""Karma on Tap"" is a must-read."
5,Twp pack video set,Two tape set contains 8 stories in all in a deluxe box with tapes in standard picture sleeve cases. The two tapes are the same as available seperately: Clifford's Best Friends / Here Comes Clifford!
1,Got a used CD when paid for a new one,I just got my CD in the mail and was very disappointed. My CD came wrapped in clear plastic with no labels whatsoever. The CD case had a huge chip/crack on one side. When I opened the CD case it was dirty and looked like it was wiped down with a dirty rag. I will not buy from this company again.
5,Something to make you appreciate life...,"I have every CD David Gray has put out...This is one of my favorite's. ""Coming Down"" hit home and the heart. Every lyric, every line of words, hit home & the heart. Yes, Its deep, but it is a soul shiner!!!!!!!!!!!!! "" Loves old song"" a treasure."
5,BEST CD OF ALL TIME! OH YEAH.,"Don't be a sucka. Get this album! It is the bestalbum of all time, with the best song of all time, ""NewHorizon's"". I have to skip over about half of the tracks because they are so inspirational/meaningful that I feel I have to save them. This album has a little bit of everything-cynicism, joy, reality, love, clarity, hope, and promise.... To David and his fans, get into this album. This is his/your masterpiece. It is well worth the price tag and a best kept secret...."
5,His finest work,"I'm a huge David Gray fan, and this album was when I my first introduction to him a few years ago. I had read a brief Rolling Stone review saying this was good. Went to the store...that was the time where the CD store, would actually open up a CD and let you preview it before buying. I was instantly hooked. I have all of his other albums and seen him in concert several times.Sadly all of his subsequent albums, in my opinion, have come up short in comparison to this one. Love the rough edgy heartfelt sound of the songs and amazing lyrics.If stranded on a desert island and could only pick one CD....would pick this one."
5,Not just for Christmas,"Even though I recieved this CD after Christmas, I've enjoyed the music more than most of my recent purchases. There are only a couple of selections that would be considered Christmas carols, but even those, along with the others, are some of the loveliest music you could hope to find. Relaxing and uplifting at the same time. I'll be playing this all year round."
1,"Conservatism ""lite""","This book could not be any more useless. I can see why only a conservative press would publish it. What a weird little cult the Kirk cult is. Definitely avoid this condescending, yet unlearned author."
4,Insightful!,"Investment pro Michael J. Panzner offers an insider's guide to Wall Street that will appeal to investors on several levels. He starts with easy-to-comprehend definitions of stock market terms such as ""short-selling"" and ""equity-derivative products,"" and advances to more sophisticated concepts. With his down-to-earth approach, he demystifies the jargon, hype and superfluous data. What's more, he provides an excellent account of the historical factors and recent innovations that have altered global finance. His ""10 laws of the new investment universe"" are useful and comprehensive. Unfortunately, Panzner tends to glorify the past, glossing over well-documented foibles to focus on modern sins. Still, he provides a frank and insightful view of Wall Street's seductive lure. We recommend this book to investors who want to understand today's market."
2,A good starter book,"I bought ""Stock Market Jungle"" after reading some of the favorable reviews. The book is helpful for those who need an introduction to changes in the industry. This book does not shed any new light on current issues facing the industry. One has to question the credibilitly of any market professional that tells you that this book is excellent or insightful; either they are being deceitful (not to surprising when you consider the source!!!) or they shouldn't be in the financial industry because they obviously haven't been paying attention. I suppose the glowing reviews were more disappointing to me than the book."
3,Read description carefully!,"I ordered this storage case for my son's Melissa and Doug puzzles. However it does not fit them. The description states that it fits ""standard"" puzzles. It does not fit the ""chunky"" puzzles he has which it fails to mention. The Melissa and Doug website where this is also available clearly states that. Item was also damaged from the plastic shipping bands."
1,Useless as it doesn't fit all the puzzles your child will have,My son has some standard size puzzles with small pegs and some large chunky puzzles all by Mellissa and Doug. This case only fits the standard puzzles. So more than half of this case is empty for me plus I still have to look for another storage for the chunky ones. At least it would have been nice if they had a matching case for the chunky puzzles but doesn't look they have one. I hate this product as it's occupying space but is half empty and half of the puzzles are still lying outside!
2,Only certain puzzles will do!,"This is a cute product, but will only hold flat puzzles or ones with tiny plastic pegs. My son has many flat puzzles with various size wooden pegs on them. I just pile them all in it any which way they will go. The little racks are too close vertically for my son's puzzles, or too wide for his square wooden puzzles. I was disappointed, but at least they are stacked in something for now to keep them contained. I guess I could have just put them all in a cute square basket..."
2,Disappointed that M&D puzzles don't fit in their own storage case!,I really needed storage for our puzzles but am disappointed to find that Melissa & Doug puzzles don't fit in a Melissa & Doug storage case. Seems to be good craftsmanship otherwise.
2,Chunky puzzles dont fit,The case does not hold its own puzzles. I have the chunky puzzles by Melissa and Doug and they dont fit in the case. I had to return it because the wires racks are not wide enough. Its a sturdy case but not made for the chunky puzzles. I was disappointed.
3,Not all Melissa & Doug puzzles fit!,"This rack is very cute & durable. The only issue I have with it is that not all Melissa & Doug puzzles fit.When I bought it, I was under the impression that they all would. My son has Mellisa & Doug's farm puzzle & truck puzzle. Neither of these will fit without removing some of the edge pieces. If I put the pieces on top of the puzzles, then another puzzle cannot go in the next slot up. The puzzles with the knobs on them seem to fit fine."
3,doesn't fit their puzzles!,"I love Melissa & Doug products, unfortunately this one did not fit most of the puzzles I have by them! The pieces hit the metal racks on either side, requiring me to remove some pieces to make them fit."
1,Don't buy for storing Melissa and Doug puzzles!,"Liked the color and construction, but not one of the M & D puzzles fit in it!! And you will not figure this out until it is completely unwrapped."
1,Made by Melissa and Doug but hardly for Melissa and Doug puzzles!,"My kids are very much into puzzles and have ONLY Melissa and Doug puzzles in various forms We purchased this because it is manufactured BY Melissa and Doug, however, only one of the five different styles of Melissa and Doug puzzles that we own fit into the slots. This means we still have about 8 other puzzles that do not fit. This was an expensive item and disappointing because we'll now need to buy another storage rack for the other types of Melissa and Doug puzzles. I would not purchase this item again."
3,Excellent Product but damaged when arrived,"It is excellent storage for standard size puzzles. Puzzles I got from target also fit very well. Unfortunately, it is damaged when I opened package. Both top and bottom are bended. Painting on top is scratched a lot. I hope that Amazon will replace this."
3,Disappointing,"Knowing that this is a Melissa and Doug product, we figured that it would fit their puzzles. Unfortunately, that wa not the case. Most of the puzzles were larger and won't fit in the rack. Why make a puzzle rack that is too small for your own puzzle products, Melissa, and Doug??"
2,Bummed out,"I was really excited to have somewhere to store all of our Melissa and Doug puzzles and after reading a review on how this holder even held the chunky puzzles I thought it would be perfect. Sad to say it doesn't fit any of our chunky puzzles without taking most of the pieces out! Kind of defeats the purpose of organization, but we will keep it for a couple smaller puzzles we have."
3,teacher management lifesaver,"I think the colors are so-o-o- appealing. It seems to be very sturdy and will withstand the handling of little hands and big hands as it will be of a lifesaver for myself , the six-year olds,and the open space of a first grade classroom. I've been searching for just the perfect thing to keep my puzzles in tact and clean and most of all organized. I really hope I can purchase these soon. THANKS.......THANKS..../.a bunch!"
2,Doesn't even fit Melissa and Doug puzzles,"The construction and paint of this storage case is great. Typical Melissa & Doug quality, but the product doesn't even hold most of the wood puzzles we own, including many that are Melissa & Doug. The spacing is just not great enough to accommodate most wood puzzles that have peg handles are that have pieces that thicker."
4,"A must for writers, abonus for readers.","""The Science in science fiction"" effectively presents how SF is based in solid fact. It explains, often in detail, how SF ideas and technology are based on real-life scientific advances and cutting-edge research. Excellent colour illustrations and detailed examples from SF novels round out the no-nonsense links the author traces between fact and fiction, leaving readers with the impression that what many pass off as ""fantasies"" may one day be accepted facts. Writers, in particular, beginning writers of SF would find this book particularly useful in avoiding the impossibilities one all-too-often finds in new or lower-quality SF. Readers, too, will appreciate the simplicity of the layout and the directness of the subject treatment, and the non-technical layout makes it easier for the layman to understand. All in all, a very good book, although I was let down by the lack of speculation on possible future advances."
5,Love this metal,I purchased this metal to use to make jewelry. It works perfectly. Comes with a clear plastic film on it for protection from scratches. Make sure you remember to take the film off after you cut your pieces. It is difficult to tell it is on top of the metal!
4,Best book for Reservoir Engineers,"This book is very well written and would be a very useful on the shelf of Reservoir engineers who want to have quick look at the methods to do well tests on the available well pressure data. I found the explanations for the tests to be short, but then they are precise! You can use them to understand the subject pretty easily if you have a basic understanding.I'd not recommend this for a novice. You should have knowledge of reservoir engineering subject and maths (differential equations) if you want to purchase this book and use it. It is on the expensive side too.As for myself, i'd use this book as an when required as its difficult to remember all the tests and how they should be used (i'd not use the calculations myself - but its good to have).A nice purchase personally."
5,They don't make it anymore,"I love this product! I use it above my cheekbones to hide under eye puffiness!! It really helps enhance your cheekbones too! I now use Maybelline Instant Rewind concealer in the ""brightner"" shade!!!! It is great - I really am so glad they make a brighner!!! I am 41 and I absolutely need something really light to highlight and this does the trick!"
3,Great disco songs collection but some of it came short,"I am giving it three stars only because the 4 picture discs ""Disco Nights"" CD collection is still fine. It has great disco classics songs despite some misgivings. Some of the tracks are hard to find on CD. But one have to be careful and aware that this is a Canadian label import CD. The music was featured in a Canadian radio station by two Canandian DJ's. Some of the songs were re-recorded or remixed. Most of the songs however are in their original mix. One suppose that the remix tracks were for the radio station or for the Canadian Unidisc label. Nevertheless, the sound is good and the music is great. While most of the songs are in thier orignal mix you have to decide whether songs like ""I will survive"" which is a remix or re-recorded version your cup of tea. The brief liner notes are in French but the rest of the credits are in English."
5,Incredible,"Sondheim produces music that I can never get out of my head. I don't always catch onto the tunes and rhythms right away, but with time they become embedded in my mind. ""Follies"" is one of my favorites and sadly, one of the Sondheim plays I'm dying to see but think I have no chance. Too bad, because I'd love to see these songs come to life on the stage.My only real complaint is that since the original ambitious plans for a gatefold, vinyl double album were jettisoned for a smaller production, the ending especially feels cut off. Maybe the original didn't end with a big fluorish and refrain of ""Beautiful Girls"" but I can't imagine that being true. Despite being recorded in 1971, this cast album is lush and sounds more organic than other recordings of the same show. Excellent."
3,Too raw,"Follies is one of my favourite musicals of Sondheim.I truly admire his work both as a lyricist and a composer,but the realcharm of Sondheim is for me the combination of both. Follies is a wonderful example for his maestry.Still,this version doesn't reach the half of what reaches the London version with Diana Rigg.Everything is much more mature in the London version:The interpretation of the orchestra is more sensitive,much more flexible and supports so much better the singers,the soloists are much more interesting in the London version ( it shows especially in the songs ""IN BUDDY'S EYES"",THE RIGHT GIRL"", ""LOSING MY MIND"" ,""TOO MANY MORNINGS"" etc...).Besides,there were more numbers added later that are naturally not included here (among them the wonderful ""A COUNTRY HOUSE"" and ""AH, BUT UNDERNEATH"") .If it's the first version you listen to it's another story.I'm sure you'll find Sondheim's music,how to say it ... simply delicious!"
3,Not exactly what I expected,"I was expecting something different, but I will finish the book to try and understand the author's viewpoint. I wish though that I had purchased another Graham Hancock book."
4,"God Bless Eisner, America, and (last of all) Disney","This book is as entertaining and provocative as Bruck's `Predator's Ball,' Burrough's Barbarians at the Gate,' and, for that matter, the author's `Den of Thieves.' What could be better than a tale of greed, venality, hubris -- and Mickey Mouse?Advocates of unregulated markets and `self-correcting' corporations may want to read this book, which is as colorful as fiction. Those who own Disney stock might want to avoid it."
3,Great writing. Bad subject matter.,"If you like spending quality time with highly intelligent yet emotionally retarded multi-millionaires this book is for you. Very well written, well researched, no argument there, but honestly, after 100 pages you wonder why you're even reading this. There isn't a sympathetic character within 100 miles of Burbank. Everyone lies. Everyone's greedy. Everyone's unhappy. Everyone's earning a gazillion dollars. I suppose Roy Disney's got some integrity, but he unleashed these dogs on Disney in the first place."
5,Must read for all Disney Corp. shareholders....,and really anyone who has a deep interest in the Disney brand/art/works/etc. A compelling look inside one of our most beloved companies and at corporate politics and power structures.
5,Successful insight on all accounts,"I purchased this book to gain an understanding of the rise and fall of Michael Eisner in the Disney organization. Not only did I get a full overview, with some very interesting details, of Eisner's career (how he came to Disney, what he did to improve the company, and then his ultimate fall) but gained other invaluable insight on the Disney Company and its major players throughout the years. I learned so much about how huge companies such as Disney function in terms of public trading, leadership and politics. Stewart definitely did his research, and I believe he fairly presented all sides of the arguements with effective footnotes, endnotes and proper credentials. It was SO interesting and although I am a Disney fan myself, I completely recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about big companies in corporate America. If you are a Disney fan and think you know all there is to know about Disney, think again. READ THIS BOOK! I couldn't put it down."
4,ain't it the truth!,"wow, i was there when this drama was happening! i'm NOT a reader, but I am mezmerized with the facts."
2,poor customer service,"I ordered this book on audio CD from alibris. The audio book is on 20 cd's. I received cd's 11 thru 20 but NOT 1-10. When I contacted Alibris, they said they could not look for the missing cd's and they issued refund. I didn't want refund...I wanted the first half of the book...they couldn't be bothered...they just wanted to be done with me. Very Poor Customer Service...hence the 2 star rating...it would be a one star rating but they did issue credit for my purchase. I would look elsewhere for purchasing your used books and audio cd's!"
4,Precision writing. Spot on reporting. Nothing personal.,"The fireworks on the cover might lead you to believe there's a bombshell inside. Sadly, there isn't anything other than a smoking gun.The book is a critical examination of Michael Eisner's decisions at the helm of Disney. He reports on the outcomes of those decisions but it's like reading a book about the 4th of July from the perspective of someone who arrived after the show ended. Michael Eisner is probabaly a paranoid and he appears to be a pathological liar as well as a major control freak, but don't expect Stewart to explore those aspects. Unfortunately for the reader, by the time you get half way through the book, that is exactly what you are hoping to have answered.The book is worth reading, but don't be surprised if you put it down after Stewart reports, for the 100th time, that Michael Eisner stabbed in the back, another executive he recruited in the first place."
2,And I should care because?,"I'm not that far into this, but I'm quickly losing patience. In view of the very serious challenges faced by America (and American business), the backroom machinations of a bunch of overprivileged, petulant, egomaniacal one percenters are less than enthralling.I suspect the prime audience for this book is Hollywood executives, who will pick it up, flip to the index to see if they're mentioned, and if not, put it back down."
3,Mostly Interesting....,"I'm only about half way through this book so far. Mostly interesting...As I am interested primarily in the personalities involved I find I'm slogging through the business-speak of a lot of the book...I really don't care who bought how many shares of one company at so many dollars while trying to acquire a new company whose share was going for X dollars and is now Y dollars but would have been worth Z dollars in 1965 etc, etc, etc....I'm sure the chapters relating directly to Ovitz will be interesting!"
2,Does this book have a logical thesis?,"Beginning this book with the knowledge that it is a bitter account of a bitter affair, I was stunned by the lack of fairness or logic to the book's treatment of Disney's Michael Eisner.The only points I have come away with are that an aggressive CEO micromanaged his (successful) operation, and that in his position of power, Eisner grew increasingly distrustful of those around him. Who wouldn't, I wonder.Michael Ovitz, portrayed as both an innocent victim of Eisner's plotting and an ineffectual weakling unable adapt to Disney or to read the handwriting on the wall, is way too flat in this account to resemble a real or sympathetic person.The successes of Eisner, by and large, are attributed to his heads-up inner circle, while his failures are his alone; more often than not, his failures are attributed to a psychic malaise upon which never Stewart never sharpens his focus."
5,Behind the Disney Magic,"Disney War is one of the most thought provoking and insightful looks inside the company that has transformed American imagination. The investigative journalistic style brought to life by Stewart takes you on a thrill ride over the 20 year reign of Michael Eisner. Some of the industry giants such as Katzenberg, Roy E Disney, and Igar surfaced during this history lesson of the Walt Disney Company.Make sure your seat belts are fastened as you travel through history with a look back at Disney's humble beginnings, and then fashioned itself into a movie-making powerhouse that saw hits like The Lion King, Pirates of the Caribbean, and Lost while losing out on some TV hits like Survivor, CSI and The Apprentice.This rare look inside the Disney Corporation was eye-opening and a wonderful read. I would highly recommend this read to anyone who would love to peer inside what made Disney tick or didn't."
3,Greedy in The Magic Kingdom,"Certainly the author researched the book well and the reader felt a part of the inner machinations of the company, but after 200 pages, I felt thoroughly disgusted with all the characters, feeling little empathy or sympathy. After a while it was hard to get excited about millions, billions or zillions of dollars and stock options and I felt Walt Disney and the creators of Snow White, Fantasia and Pinocchio must be turning over in their graves at the current crop of Disney leaders."
3,to big,"After receiving the case I found it,much to large for what I wanted to use it for. A more accurate size discription might have helped me make a better choice."
5,GREAT MUSIC,THE cd has great music from the 50's & 60's. it has one of my father in laws songs on the cd. the song is why oh why. it is great to hear his song..............
3,"OUTDATED, VISIONARY THRILLER","When this book came out in 56, it must have caused a sensation. Thinking in 50's terms, the book certainly was a great and thrilling read, but audiences are more sophisticated today, and what was probable in 56 is not so probable today, and even seems a little dumb. But, if you've managed to hold on to your innocence and haven't plowed through a thousand illogical TV and Film mysteries, you might get a kick out of this one-time great mystery which spawned copies everywhere."
4,Excellent beginning and middle section. Weak ending,"The first two parts of this book are excellent. Part One is chilling because of its depiction of what is now known as Anti-Social Personality Disorder. The fact that it was written way back in the 50's long before American Psycho's Patrick Bateman makes this even more creepy. Part One manages to put the reader in the killer's deranged little mind and even makes us cheer him on a little bit.Part Two of the book is excellent because it is completely different from Part One. It puts us in the shoes of the victim from Part One's sister as she tries to discover the identity of the killer and narrows it down to two men, but which one?It's unfortunate that Part Three is so typical after the cleverness of Parts One and Two. The ending isn't nearly as shocking as the end of Levin's later masterpiece, Rosemary's Baby but up until Part Three you'll be on the edge of your seat."
4,"Lovely, dated suspense","A Kiss Before Dying takes one back to men wearing fedoras and languidly building suspense plots. This one keeps adding layer on layer. You know what's going to happen, but when? And how? It is refreshing not to conjure suspense by plumbing grisly details for effect, but rather by exploring characters. Can't put it down, yet won't become ill with gore. The campus atmosphere also evokes past times. Should have been a top film (was it?)."
5,Best Mystery Ever !,"I am reading this book for the third time. The first time was when it first came out, then some years later, and now I'm reading it again. Although I don't usually read mysteries, this one is so mesmerising that over the years I have always counted this as one of my favorite books, no matter what the genre. It is fast paced, not an unnecessary word. And the ending-- well, you have to read it."
4,Good Content... extremely Poor Typeface,"I found this book to be very interesting and a good overall vibes of the piecing together of the cosmic ladder. It is well suited for undergraduate reference. That said, this is one of the poorest Kindle formatted publications that I have ever read and given the cost even for a Kindle copy, it was a grave disappointment. The font appears to have been a poor choice and the impression shows missing parts of characters that I would not have expected at this price. Amazon needs to,step up and improve typeface quality to make things more legible."
1,unreadable,I looked at Zhang's book for an article that I was writing on Fitzgerald (I am a professor of English). The book is basically unreadable; Zhang doe not write particularly well--nor does he have any noteworthy things to say. Skip.
1,belaboring the obvious,"Re:""Enchanted Places"" 1. Disappointing, overall 2. Derivative work; belabors the obvious 3. Heavy-handed analysis further weighed down by cumbersome prose"
2,Contradictory,"This book is riddled with contradictions. Like one chapter will say, ""eat more broccoli"" then four chapters later it'll say, ""don't eat broccoli."" In the end, one is left where they started, no more certain whether eating more broccoli makes any difference in the quality of one's skin only certain that the cost of the book made a useless dent in one's pocketbook. Another efficient marketing propaganda tool feeding fear-based drivel to insecure women everywhere in order to convince them to buy Perricone products."
5,the Perricone Prescription,It is the second book I have by Him and I love it. It's just full of healthy ideasand easy to follow. Also beauty ideas andhow to achieve a younger look. The 28 dayplan is very interesting.
1,Over-Priced Snake Oil Salesman,"I'm a physician. I checked Perricone's peer-reviewed publications in PUBMED. There were only four, the most recent in 1996 which showed a miniscule sun-protection factor of 2.4 for topical glycolic acid. This is a far cry from his exaggerated claims, partial truths, and out-right lies in this book. The five-star reviews titled ""Fringe Benefits!"" and ""The Perricone Prescription"" read like shills for Perricone's incredibly high-priced products. Go to his website's store (http://www.nvperriconemd.com/), where he has a 2 ounce bottle of topical Lipoic Acid for $95!! This is typical for his products. Better yet, eat a ""Mediterranean diet"", skip this book, and ignore his advice on supplements. He's rich enough already."
4,Great Diet...,"I have to say that I became hooked on this when my 65 year old mother shed 20 lbs. after years of not being able to lose a pound. My husband and I just began the 28-day course and while getting used to a no carb diet, we feel great and have much more energy. I would recommend this book only if: 1. you can overlook his egoisim and self-serving attitude 2. overlook his contradictions (ie.,he suggests we eat only organic and non farm raised salmon, a great thing, but he then totes Proctor&Gamble and other animal testing companies...absurd)3. Get over the need to buy his products. Whatever you are doing now is great. He is not some guru, he just tells us that most of the world is pretty healthy and gives us a regime that is pretty easy to follow. Go for it, you have nothing to lose."
1,Pretty good as a diet book....,"This is a bad book -- mostly because it is just a long advertisement for Perricone's products. The ""research"" he keeps referring to is not peer reviewed, not published in any medical journal, not performed using scientific method, etc. His research is anecdotal. 2 or 3 of his patients liked this particular lotion, 4 of his patients saw improvement with this cream, etc. His ""diet"" is the only thing of any value -- he advises eating lots of fruits and vegetables and he encourages the consumption of salmon. A bit of advice: be sure to SMELL his products before you buy them....stinky! (that comment doesn't refer to the book....)"
4,"Response to ""what about mercury poisoning?""","Dr. Perricone is on the money with his dietary advice. As for the concern about mercury, consider that Salmon is not associated with mercury poisoning. Go to google and search on something like ""salmon mercury poisoning"" and find out for yourself, check the FDA sites. Any diet that recommends fresh wild salmon is starting out on the right foot."
4,So far so good,"I finished this book and am now applying what is in the book to my own body. I'm feeling alot better, have more energy, and folk say i look better. Perhaps it's wishful thinking, but maybe it works. I know one thing that is fact, I lost 10 pounds. Also, the guy makes sense and the book is an interesting read. I only just started the program so I can't as of yet let anyone know. All I can say is the first impressions are looking mighty good."
5,The doctorsecret is now out.,"Hi fellow antiWrinkle and antiagers!I wrote this before on a different book review. The book is really a good menu or instruction set. It is written well and very enlightning. I'm sure it was made to promote his products but I found several websites that sell the stuff at a better price. doctorsecret.com or even ebay. The process is the best one written so far. I often hear I look 10-15 years younger. At this rate I'll be 16 again soon. Dr Perricone is handsome and intelligent, that helps in the selling. The Glycolic acid treatment proceedure or Serum CEster described are the best.Thanks and good luck."
4,"Effective, but expensive!","I certainly recommend this book as it is truly effective. I have lost weight, improved my skin, and have more energy. I never feel bloated or lethargic. If you have the dicipline to stick to the regimen, you will see improvement.The only caveat is that the recommended topicals (most of which have to be bought online or in a specialty cosmetics store) and the vitamin supplements, which are numerous, adds up to hundreds of dollars yearly. This is fine if finance is not a problem, but for a regular working stiff like myself, it is a little overwhelming. That's why I took off a star."
4,loved the book--not crazy about the results,"I thought the book was very good, although I was a little confused as to what constituted the face lift, which products to buy, etc. I have modified my diet--but not totally--and started drinking water. Like many readers, I found much cheaper products through beauticontrol. However, I have been disappointed in the results. Back to the book--I bought it for the information, although self-serving and marketing oozed from every page."
1,LIFE IS TOO SHORT FOR THIS!,"I can't imagine how anyone could stay on this diet, especially if, like me, you are allergic to fish! Also, eating out, which, like it or not, is a part of our culture, is impossible on this diet plan, and the expense for the food, supplements and products is not for someone living on a tight budget. This plan might work for rich Hollywood types who have unlimited time and money, and can afford to hire someone to prepare meals, but not for middle-income folks."
4,Best Skin Book I've Read,"Clear and knowledgeable and covers a lot of ground. If you're serious about fighting wrinkles, this is a helpful book."
3,Seek newer publications...,"Dr Parricone's writings are all fantastic, but they improve with each new publication. I recommend looking at his newer items before considering purchasing this one."
1,Great book!! Definitely a Five Star book.,This book is awesome. I have been following the steps provided in this book and the results have been great. I even started taking the appropriate supplements and using the suggested skin care products in the book. This book informs us on the importance in eating the right foods to maintain healthy skin and body. The exercise plan is fairly simple and not overwhelming. Get this book!! You will thank yourself later.
2,Wrinkles not curable !,"If all this diet and cream stuff really worked, Hollywood would have no aging stars, for they all rather see a surgeon, and even then, they still look old. Aging is a fact of life. We were not meant to be everlasting. Yes, diet can give you a health body and better looking skin, but food does not get rid of wrinkles, only traumatic surgery which often looks worse than having lines. Moreover, look at Dr. Perricone himself. He has a lot of crows feet around his eyes."
1,Horrible diet restrictions and nothing much new......,"I bought this book out of curiosity. If you could actually stick with a diet this restrictive, then go for it. I have lost and gained all of my life and his diet isn't new. It's just another low carb diet with lots of salmon. My suggestion would be to buy some glycolic acid for your face and do the Atkins Diet instead of this. Not only will your face look great, but you'll save a ton of money.OK, now let's all attack Dr. Phil....he deserves it more than this bozo."
1,Nothing to learn here,"Perricone is constantly regurgitating information in order to sell his books and overpriced skin care products. He is riding his fame like a wave that is going to crash soon. If you have the Wrinkle Cure then you don't need this book or his newest book, ""The Acne Prescription"" Most of the information in his books is nothing new or revolutionary. I knew about the supplements he mentions and topical agents long before he started writing books. He is not quite as revolutionary as he seems to think."
3,Hard to swallow.,"Although its probably unintentional, this seems to be a retread of the Zone diet.What gets people's attention is that Dr. Perricone's suggestions do include some foods that people actually like to eat, like salmon and berries.That's the good news; now the rest. Say goodbye, not only to sweets and junk food, but also bread, rice, potatoes. Diet soda or regular? Neither. Butter or margerine? Neither.I tried the introductory diet and darn if my skin did not improve (a little) but if I have to live on protein and 12 glasses of water, I'll settle for less than perfect skin."
2,thee lastest fleecing of the public,I thought that this book was fairly well written in terms ofstyle. Substance however is yet another story.I am a molecular chemist and found most of the theoriesherein presented to be hogwash. I think this material is just the fad-of-the-moment with no scientific basis at all.It's just a matter of time until the next book in the series comes along: the perricone weight loss diet. Mark my words.
3,Confusing Errors,"This book is an entertaining read, and the program may even work. But did no one edit it?A few things I noticed: The shopping list for the 3-day diet calls for 8 oz. sliced chicken or turkey; the diet itself calls for 12. The supplement recommendation for alpha lipoic acid is 200 mg on page 78, but 100 mg on page 107. Most glaringly, the 28-day program calls for a bedtime vitamin supplement which is *never specified* -- at least not where the morning and lunchtime doses are listed!This author's last book was a bestseller. Surely they could have spent a few bucks to make sure this one checked out."
4,Book makes sense.,"Although I did not find any evident to prove any of Dr. Perricone's finding regarding this program. I found that most of which made a lot of sense. The idea behind imflamation causing most of skin problems and his ideas about how to reduce it made too much sense to not try it. So I'm trying it. I don't have the worst skin nor the best skin. It's too oily but breaks outs are very rare except on my back which happens more often than I prefer. My complexion is not even and line are starting to develop. So far, I've been on the program for a week and my skin is less oily and lines are slightly less visible. There is some weight loss as well but that's not what I'm looking for. [..]"
4,The Perricone Prescription,Dr Perricone has some very interesting ideas. He does a great job of documenting why his suggestions work and provides numerous diet menus and activity suggestions.There are times when he gets a littel over dramatic (a Snickers bar is better for you than a baked potato!?) but generally speaking his advice is sound.
3,It Really Works!,"This diet works....if you want to eat salmon for breakfast, lunch and dinner for the rest of your life."
3,Nothing new,"I bought this for my wife but I also read it since she told me that the book was like many others regarding diet and health. Well it just tells you the drawbacks of a poor diet. Yes, it does point out types of foods to avoid but, if you are into health and good eating it's nothing out of the norm."
2,Pseudoscience,"Much of the science in this book is questionable. Unfortunately there is also some good useful information in the book so the uninformed reader will have a difficult time separating the wheat from the chafe. But please realize that sugar containing foods do not cause a cellular inflammation throughout the body. Also the supplementation appears to be oriented towards doing no harm. That is good but much of it will not help either. Unfortunately this book appears to appeal to the desperate who are looking for the magic bullet any magic bullet other than good nutrition. Also, almost any book or doctor or health conscious person can tell you that drinking a large volume of water every day will do wonders for your complexion and skin. Eating a healthy diet on top of that will be even better. The use of supplements in addition probably does little or nothing."
2,"Good book, but no help for vegetarians or vegans","Having watched Dr. Perricone's PBS specials, I ordered and received the book a few days later. There is a lot to help in there, but he and his staff could have easily researched and presented alternatives to fish, chicken, meat, eggs, milk and other animal products which have clearly shown to adversely affect human beings.Getting the nutrition necessary to carry out his program can come from many other sources in the Plant kingdom.Lets get those Vegetarian Recipes Dr. Perricone! Until that time, your book will sit on the shelf."
4,It works!,"Well, I don't know about the vitamins and the skin products (though I bought them) but the book makes sense (almost too much technical detail) and I lost 10 pounds! Could use more recipies though..."
1,Cure wrinkles? Then why does he have them?,"Interesting special on PBS... but, why do people that promise methods to ""cure"" one of your ""problems"" still have the problem? Dr. Perricone has fine lines and wrinkles!!!The Dr. talks about curing wrinkles and has a whole line of products for a whole lot of money to cure them. If he could cure and repair wrinkles with dietary supplements, creams and lotions, his products would be classified as drugs and would have to be approved by the FDA. They are not.Freedom of speach certainly produces its share of crackpots."
2,Substance over Style,"His products have a lot of style, but not a lot of substance. Not working for my needs."
1,Fraud!,"This book is a complete fraud. The author states that the before and after photos are unretouched - which is true. But the models are not unretouched! In every photo, the before photo of each model is without any makeup. All of the after photos are of the models wearing makeup. Look at their lips and eyses. You can clearly see that they are all wearing lip gloss and eye liner in the after photos. Don't waste your money. The author is a crook!"
3,Need food lists,Tapes are alright but if you have the book you can see what is on the food list to eat and avoid. The lists are read off but its hard to keepup with it. They should insert food lists with tapes.
2,They Looked Just The Same!!!,"Is it just me, or did all the ""after"" pictures look exactly like the ""before"" pictures? Slight change of expression perhaps, or maybe a little lipstick, but they looked like they could have been taken at the same photo shoot. I'm not moved!"
4,Great Book for Health Conscious,"This is a very helpful book for anyone interested in health, feeling great, or looking great. I actually found the diet recommendations more helpful than any other book I've read on health. The 28-day program menus are not particularly practical, but together with the information in the text, they helped me formulate a diet that has worked to help me feel great all the time, slim down, and stay that way."
4,Life Changing,"Finally, a plan that makes sense and really does what it says it will. After many years of trying numerous diet and health plans, I had grown extremely skeptical. I was looking for something to put my body back on track after years of improper eating habits. And to reduce my cholestrol, in particular. This book did everything I wanted it to and more! Plus, my husband joined me in the Perricone plan. We both lost weight, reduced cholestrol significantly and gained an overall healthier feeling. We'll never go back to our self-destructive ways!"
3,If I won the lottery ...,"I don't doubt that eating alot of protein, mostly in the form of fish, is beneficial. But when add to that an astounding amount of vitamin supplements, skincare products, and electrical muscle stimulating devices as part of the regime, I'd have to win the lottery to be able to afford this diet! For me, anyway, it's just not practical."
1,Where's the replication of outcome studies?,"I gave this hype a shot; bought all the prescribed topicals and internals. After 9 months I saw absolutely no change at all. In an attempt to find peer reviews on his research I could find nothing. It comes down to this, stay out of the sun, eat a balaced diet and exercies for 40 minutes 5 days a week and you will be the best you can be without going under the knife. It would be wonderful if his stuff really works but objectively I know it does not and the lack of replicatable results is unprofessional. Oh yes his product list is long and very expexpensive - never trust a doctor who owns his own pharmacy!"
1,CORNIEST MOVIE EVER!!!,"The action scenes in this movie were horrible. The music is a joke. DO NOT BUY THIS. The special effects were the worst i have ever seen in my life. And the ending...no comment on that one, just bad. This makes the real delta forces look like losers."
2,"dirty, smelly and overpriced.","This cotton cover fits ok and functions pretty well. but! I thought I noticed the smell ofurine in the room that I had the garment rack and cotton cover. After doing some checking Idetermined that the odor was coming from the cotton cover.So I washed the cover in the washingmachine two times . the rinse water dumping into the laundry sink after the first washingwas filthy , so I washed it a second time. Now it smells clean and fresh. My other gripe is thiscover should cost about one half of its $66.00 price."
1,Where is My Canvas cover?,"I purchased this item september 8th. I have not received it. I received everything else that I purchased on the same date. I went back to check on my amazon account and it says this product was delivered on sept 18th. Where was it shipped, because it has not arrived at my home? Just wondering? I would like to have this Canvas cover asap. Or please refund my money asap. Thank you."
1,Don't buy this,I was fooled by the picture. it is just a cover for a wardrobe! while looking for wardrobes i forund this and belived it was good value for money. On reciept i have found that is is a cover and of no use without the frame. I would love to buy the frame if it was in the catalogue.Over priced waste of money.
4,it'll do,"not quite what i had hoped for, but its no fault of the manufacturer or advertising; it does do the job. wish the method of securing it was slightly more sophisticated for the price, maybe buttons or snaps. it could also use a grommet at the very bottom. all in all though, not terrible.to note, intermetro does make (or at least, made) a similar cover with a zipper, i saw one as a display in the store i bought my shelves, but they were sold out and so was everyone else, a shame."
5,What pop-punk should be like,"Consumed is a band that never got the attention and acclaim they so rightfully earned. They understood the dynamics of making a really great song. These songs don't lean too far to the punk side or the pop side, but they blend both styles equally with skill and precision that all these new bands wish they had. Each song is well thought out, well written, and super tight. As others have said, this isn't the typical Fat Wreck affair, and while bands like NOFX tend to accentuate speed and predictable riffs, Consumed add more emphasis and guts to their songs. Get the records while you can, because they've recently broken up, and they will be missed."
4,It works great.,"I did not receive this product. They have sent me the double waffle maker 1200 series. So, at first I was very disappointed, since I have researched the waffle makers very carefully, and I really wanted this waffle maker. But after I tried out the substitute I am satisfied with it. I am just hoping it will last and continues to work without any problems. I gave only four stars because I did not like the fact that they took the initiative to change my order without my consent."
4,useful,"I have used this tool occasionally for about 7 years to reach ""high spots"" that cannot be reached any other way.In fact, I just used it last week, and had no problems with the wing nut as mentioned by previous reviewers. However, it should be stated that I never adjust the wing-nut... ever. I have always left it locked in one universal position (a 45 degree angle), and only use it for 'reaching' with an extension pole.One minor complaint I have found is that the brush is so difficult to push into the actual holder, that I am afraid I am going to break something (probably on me). Don't know if this is normal, but at least I never worry that the brush is going to fall out. I like the ""push-in, pull-out"" attachment for the brush, better than having to adjust any bolt to hold the brush. I will probably never use anything else as long as this keeps working like it does.I would recommend for the above specifications."
2,Not Great,"I agree with the other reviewer. Wing nuts won't stay tight, takes too long to put the brush into the unit and to remove the brush from the unit. Too flimsy with a loaded brush, brush flops around making cut-ins very time consuming and, as the other fellow put it, Frustrating!PS I am also a professional painting contractor..."
3,works best with narrow handled brushes,"This tool works best for paint brushes that have a flat vs. rounded handle and that can slide all the way into the holder. Any handle thicker than 1/4"" to 5/8"" does not fit properly and can slip out of position while painting.With the right paint brush, this is a great tool."
5,A Great Tool!,"I bought this tool to paint a tall stairway that I can't really reach without a ladder. I also needed to repair the tape between my wall and ceiling and was hoping this tool would help, it did! I was able to hook my utility knife to this unit (although that wasn't a great fit) to help cut down my old tape. The tool was a good fit with the drywall knife for applying the mud. I was able to put pretty good pressure on the knife with a 5 foot pole with no slippage. The unit is adjustable for angle and rotation. This is a very handy tool, and a great investment."
2,SOOOOO FRUSTRATING!!!!,I have been painting for twenty years and this tool is very frustrating. The wing nuts never hold while I am painting and cutting in. It is always slipping out of place. Putting the brush in and pulling the brush out is very difficult as well. I do not recommend this product.
3,extender,handy tool but you have to tighten the finger nuts with a pair of pliers or it doesn't stay tight..it sort of shakes when you use it
5,Brush Extender,"I used this to cut in on a 15 feet ceiling that i did not have a sufficiently tall ladder for.I used a 2 1/2 "" Purdy brush (flat handle) with relative ease. The reach was about 6 feet. The most difficult aspect was dipping the brush into the paint tray (from atop the ladder) and the slow swing / movement to the ceiling. It was a slow process, but once i got it on the edge..control was good and the cut in (Sand dollar to Ceiling white) was clean. I had thought about renting a taller but for the price, it seemed like a good option. Very satisfied. Don't think you could use this where you need to exert force or a large brush, there was a little of slop in the wing nut. For the job..it was fantastic."
4,"cool, very cool (but I didn't care for Hello It's Me)","Seriously, I like this album a lot, and it is very good, as one reviewer already noted, to put on as background music. You can enjoy these bossa nova covers on several different levels, but I also agree with another reviewer who called Todd's treatment of ""Hello Its Me"" as ""weird"". I did like several songs that I was not familiar with a lot (Mated, Influenza). Never Neverland works very well in this style, but perhaps the biggest surprise is the uptempo treatment of ""It Wouldn't Have Made Any Difference"". I found the album to have an overall fresh feel to it, and I did think that the production was very good with nice vocals. ""A Dream Goes on Forever"" was also very nicely done. I don't think most fans will be disappointed, but I think that maybe a few more songs could have been covered on the album. I give it a good solid 4 stars."
4,As Catchy as the flu bug on the first day of winter,How can anyone not enjoy this revamp of Todd's delicious slice of Americana. Diehard music fans owe it to themselves to pick up a copy of this title at the first opportunity.
1,"A great concept, poorly executed.","For fans of Mr. Rundgren's music and wit, this is one of his worst efforts. Rather than attempt a true blend of American pop and South American rhythm, he does neither justice. Worst of all is his dry, passionless, offbeat vocal delivery. Either he doesn't understand the concept of Bossa Nova or he's trying to make a joke at our expense. It isn't funny! Save your money, or go out and buy the original versions of these Rundgren classics. This is pure trash, a disappointing, lackluster performance from someone who could have done a lot better."
4,"Could he have used a click track, perhaps?","I agree with the other positive things I have read here but I must say that in a lot of places it sounds as if Todd laid down the vocal track without the benefit of the instruments being present. How else can I describe it: His vocals are early on some passages and late on others. I know he is a talented guy and musician so it just HAS to be a part of his interpretation of this (unique) style. But it does throw me off a bit.Rushing is especially noticable on ""Can We Still Be Friends""Are you sure Todd didn't have a double shot from Starbucks before this take?""Influenza"" also had lots of rushing, but it fits the song. He is sick with ""facination"", as his ""heart, mind and will slips away"", after all. Unique style. Yes, and Artistic to the max. That's my take on it!"
5,"Love ""Hairy Maclary's"" adventures!!",Another wonderful book about Hairy Maclary. Well written and illustrated. Was hubby's favorite series of books as a kid in New Zealand. Purchased as a gift for Kindergarten teacher and she was thrilled! Highly recommend.
4,Quite a rumpus indeed!,Very funny tale of all the animals in the vet's office escaping one by one and getting into an awful tangle. We enjoyed Hairy Maclary from Donaldson's Dairy and enjoyed this too.
4,MIDWEST BOOK REVIEW,"I loved this book. It is a tale that soon we will be living. Perhaps not exactly as it is portrayed by the writing, but the basic idea will be in full bloom.The book is good against evil, the rise of theAnti-Christ, coming to rule the world in all hisungodly fame and glory. The code has been found in the Bible, a code that can be used for good or for evil, the race is on.I believe that Christians will enjoy this read and it might just get a few non-believers to dig a little bit in the Word of God to see what is about to take place in this old world of ours.Recommended!"
2,"Simple, yet stupid.","I saw the story in the theater, and was tempted to kill the projectionist. I had to remind myself it wasn't his fault. He was only acting under orders. Actually, the film was so dumb it was funny. I found myself almost laughing at the scary parts, and that's why it's destined to join the ranks of other rank films like Ed Woods' PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE. If it were an animal, however, I'd have to give it a mercy killing. And the book, as I understand, runs pretty close to the film.Besides providing proof that Christian filmmaking has arrived nowhere after more than twenty years, it also revealed the silliness of Hal Lindsey's ideas for the end of the world. Once you see them ""fleshed out"" on the big screen, the one thing that becomes clear is what a trite end for the world is envisioned by this whole concept. I suggest reading End-Time Prophecies of the Bible, if you want a dramatic look at biblical prophecies for the end of time."
4,Omega Code,This book is pretty asome. It is great because Paul did a good job taking Revelations and taking what it had and apllying it to life today. And the charicters can be some what related to alot of people.
5,The good old days on CD,"I bought this CD for an ailing relative in a nursing home....these songs were played on my grandfather's gramophone which is no longer functional. I wanted a way to bring these songs back to life ...so I was delighted to find John McCormack on CD.The quality is obviously not digital but that actually adds to the charm...the slight hiss of the gramophone record can be heard but it's not overpowering.I wouldn't say this is in my line of taste, music-wise ...but I find myself putting on the CD pretty regularly ""for auld langs syne""An excellent gift for anyone with Irish roots!"
2,Not What it Seems!,"I order this book because my math teacher recommend it to all the class but it was not what I expect it will be. She tell us that this math book will help us improve our math skills and abilities but its not true! Right now I still have the same skills that I have before I ordered and the exercises and explanations are complicated, simple, fast and hard to figure out. Beside I didn't like how it arrive to my house it was all folded out and it seems like it was already return before and used so don't expect to buy books here again. S_R_C"
5,Great Review!,"I found this book to be extremely helpful. I have never been very good in the math department and this book has helped me considerably. It is very easy to understand and it makes problems such as (6/2)-(8/9)=? seem very simple.The author first gives you a basic outline and then he goes into more detail, with many sample problems. This book explains basic concepts much better than any of my former teachers ever did. I am going back to college and I needed a refresher course, I could not have asked for or found a better book to get the math review I needed. I recommend this book wholeheartedly."
1,Not a great design.,"As my guitarist pointed out it was difficult to grab the slide in the middle of playing, it resting in a tube would be easier to put the finger in to pull out the slide and the picks tend to be the opposite hand as the slide hand so if the slide was on the left, and the picks were on the right it would be a better design.Thanks anyway, not worth returning."
2,This recording is very over-hyped.,"I have long been searching for a new recording of the Bach Mass. After giving this a spin, I was very disappointed. The chorus is nearly non-existant. I do not know if this is a recording balance problem or a musical problem. But this IS a choral work. One wants the chorus to have some presence. You will not find it in this recording. At times the nattering of inner woodwind parts is given more weight in the mix than the chorus. The result is that at times the chorus is more of an obligato than is is the primary focus (as it should be).If you are searching for a fine recording of Sebastian Bach's masterpiece, then this isn't it."
2,Not Good Enough,"This recording pales in comparison to Gardiner's magnificent percormance. The sound is muddy, the instrumental playing dull and blurry, and the choir lacking in attack and verve. Forget about it. (I bought it because I was so impressed with this group's work with the Mozart Requiem, which I still enjoy every much.)"
3,"""An American interpretation""? - well...","While not a disappointment, this new Pearlman recording of the mass simply cannot compete with other modern/authentic versions such as Gardiner, Herreweghe, or Christophers. Compare the present version with, say, Gardiner's. Neither of the two can be accused of sporting a ""Germanic"" sound. But while Gardiner provides the score's full glory, religious conviction, and texture without making Bach sound like Bruckner, Pearlman's recording seems to be devoid of spirituality. And this does not just apply to the choir, even though the latter is the main weakness of this recording. I am afraid that unidiomatical best describes Pearlman's approach.We should resist the temptation to rate music along patriotic lines as the earlier reviewer has done. The obvious problem is that doing so can backfire. Do we want ""American"" to be synonymous with ""playful""? Granted, Gardiner is a Brit. Yet, I'd rather spend the additional bucks--even at the risk of appearing unpatriotic."
2,Football Jersey from Amazon,"I ordered the jersey in a Men's Small which is the size my grandson wears. I wrapped the package and when my grandsonopened it on his birthday, it was gigantic. My husband who wears a 2XL, and it would fit him.When I tried to return the jersey, I find that I have to call Customer Service. I do not want to call Customer Serviceand go through all that agony. We are stuck with a $90 jersey..........Other than sizing, the shipping was speedy, etc.I turned around and ordered another jersey from Amazon in a Youth XL, and it fits him perfectly."
4,Love the pan...Lid could fit better,"I already had this pan that didn't come with a lid (and I loved it) so when I saw this one did come with a lid, I bought it cause I make lots of double cakes (2 cake mixes fits in here perfect). However, I am disappointed that the lid doesn't 'snap on' and stay on like it should. I actually had to tape it on all 4 sides, which is still better than using foil or plastic wrap and the icing sticking to it. However, for the money, the lid should fit better. I have a 13 x 9 pan with that type of lid and it fits tight. So should this one. I would recommend it cause it bakes nice and evenly."
5,Great music,"I bought this album for my mom and she totally loved it..Marvin knows how to get down..My fav song on the album has to be ""vasos in colores""....they don't make salsa like this anymore"
4,Daughter From AAfar,This is a good book for anyone interested in international adoption. It goes through her personal story and the process of adopting from another country.
4,As enjoyable to read as a conversation with an old friend,"having read the majority of Maya Angelou's work i am aas in ""LOVE"" with her work as i am with her, the person. She writes beautifully about some harsh realities. She writes in an easy laid back manner that creates an atmosphere of familiarity and ease. Maya Angelou's pen is as soothing as her deep raspy voice. I began my love of her books immediately following her appearance on Sesame Street. I remember thinking ...I need to get to know more about this person I figured any one who moved me to tears singing with Elmo ( hard to picture isn't it?) was worth discovering...a journey I have enjoyed and found most rewarding"
3,Disappointing.,"Although the words of Ms. Angelou flow as beautifully as ever, the message of this particular ""Oprah's Book Club"" reading seems to be a little late for the times"
4,"So many differences, yet so similar","The first time I heard Maya A. speak, I had the little hairs at the back of my neck stand upright! I was moved and in awe.I have read several of her works, all of which were cherished. However, after reading ""Heart"" I felt a deeper awareness. I am a middle class, white woman. I will NEVER understand the hate, fear, and anger experienced by anyone of color- no matter how much I learn, no matter how much I empathize. What I will share with all races is that emotions are emotions, no matter the color. Raising a child, falling in love and then realizing, ""Oops, wrong one""...parental love, fear, anger...all make us human. I feel closer to this world for having forced myself to think about past misery and hatred. I wish my children the grace and dignity displayed by a remarkable woman. Thank You for reaching my soul."
4,Phenominal Woman with a Phenominal Heart!,"As an English major at Alcorn State in MS, I have read many books, bur this book has really twisted my stomach into a frenzy. This woman has boldness and strength that a lot of women today do not have. Her words were so enticing and to the point. The book kept me on my toes and urging me to want to read it more and more. I can only say that although this book was a bit biographical, it is very instrumental to the Black Woman under- standing the meaning of her heart!"
4,Autobiographical . . .,"Maya has led an interesting life! I found this more autobiographical than I'd expected, but her life experience is very entertaining. . . especially her encounter with Billie Holliday. She views her life with such joy and appears to learn from the wrong as well the positive turns that she encounters. This is a good first-read for someone not familiar w/ Maya Angelou's writing."
5,This book lead me to become a Maya Angelou fan.,"The Heart of a Woman is simply excellent. I selected this book because it was part of the Oprah club. I read it (quickly) and since then have read all of her memoirs and had the tremendous privilege of seeing her in Ottawa, Canada when she spoke at our National Arts Centre in June 1998. I recommend this book to ANYONE."
5,Lovely woman with a special knack for expressing herself in written form!,"I've heard so many good things about this woman, so I went ahead and bought my first book of hers.So impressed with her manner of expressing herself - her sincere ways, her honest fears, her passionate heart, her personal struggles and unwithering determination, and the way she allows the reader to not only identify with her in such a unique way, but also to feel like a personal friend. Reading this book is like sitting down to a cup of coffee (or tea, if preferred) and reminiscing with a good friend you've known for years. Not only do I recommend this book, but I will surely be purchasing more of her work, once I am finished reading this one."
2,I can't help being disappointed in this book.,"I had just finished reading Maya's other book ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings"" when I started ""The Heart of a Woman"". I really enjoyed the first book in the series, so I was very excited to get started on this one. The moment I began reading it, I felt something had gone terribly wrong. Self pity seems to be the underlying theme of this story. I don't want to be forced to feel sorry for this woman who has lived a very incredible life. This story also lacks the small bits of sweet humor that I found so endearing in the first one. If you are looking for the same enchanting storytelling you have found in other Angelou works, you won't find it here. Sorry...."
3,Unable to relate,"I am a young white female, and I did not find that I was able to understand or relate to this novel. I was certainly privileged to be able to read Ms. Angelou's writing as she certainly is a wonderful writer. However I did not find that the book was able to reach out to those other than the ones living in her footsteps."
5,Celebration of you and what you are,"The Heart of A Woman touches the hearts and souls of women of all color. Ms Angelou never tries to evoke the sympathy of her readers, she encourages them to celebrate their obstacles and reach for goals which may seem far out of reach. Before reading her latest book, I as a woman of color, must admit that I considered obstacles I encountered to be indigenous to who I was. I now know that we as women are all the same color when it comes to what we hope to accomplish in our lifetime. Ms Angelou continues to teach the legacy which Martin Luther King started, that we all must come together as people and not as race. I recommend this book to everyone. It is truly a celebration of life."
2,"Lots of interviews, little proof","When I first saw this book, I was intrigued by the hypothesis but once I got into it, I couldn't help but notice the book is mostly just out-of-context quotes blended with some conspiracy theories, and loaded with venom. Hertsgaard is certainly unqualified to judge the press because he is so committed to his agenda it clouds his mind.Even though he's short on facts and lacks a basic knowledge of how things work at the networks and big newspapers, Hertsgaard obviously spent a lot of time interviewing people and there are some interesting quotes from people in the press and in the reagan administration. If you don't mind reading every few paragraphs how evil and stupid Ronald Reagan was you can get some interesting quotes from people."
2,Grounded Comments From Someone Actually Listening,"I agree with what some of the others have said. This CD is a pretty huge disappointment. I have waited ever so patiently for 15 years. I bought Against the Law on the day it was released and have been listening to them since 1989.I give one star for I.G.W.T., and one star for Open Your Eyes. Every other song on this record sounds either A) bland, mid-tempo rock music that could've been written and performed by any number of faceless studio musicians. or B) Michael Sweet solo ballads. Where is Stryper? Oz? Robert? where did you go? Where is the band that wrote ""Surrender"", ""More Than a Man"" or ""Caught in the Middle""? Where is the drumming that taught me how to drum when I was 12? Not on this CD. All you'll find is bland bland songs with horrible production and a good Stryper cover-song at the very end. I like the photo on the CD cover, and I would still love to catch them live soon, but this album sucks."
3,Forces Ain't Strong Enuff,Hmm!! How should I begin??? Was excited definitely!!! Stryper's new sound of course...but somehow somewhere something is missing...It's 50/50 I should say!!! Good and bad into one. It is great to see them after over a decade to resurfaces into the new millennium...However they should hit everyone in the face with a big bang!!!! This effort was only half the STRYPER FORCE. Chould hav done way better!!
2,My 2 cents . Skip this one,"Wow, I've always loved stryper but man this is a let down. you want to hear some great melodic metal with a puch check out starbreaker, TNT's singer tony harnells new project. now THAT is a must have CD."
3,So so.,"Overall, REBORN is okay, but sounds alot like any other Christian band. There are a couple of songs that I like, but3 minutes songs, no (and I mean no) lead guitar, and poor drum production.The new bassist interview really illuminates the CD. Michael had songs written and partially recorded for a solo album and he invited the guys over. The first track, Open Your Eyes, has drums that sound very much like a drum machine - the snare is dead and the rolls sound very programmed.The vocals are over processed with effects, and most of the songs have wah and autowah that distracts from the song. The only lead is on the remake of IGWT, where the dual lead is still cool and shredding.This is a commercially aimed comeback CD. It could get airplay in the current market, but don't expect super guitar."
2,A different STRYPER,"Very disappointed album for the STRYPER fans. We have been waited so many years for them to return but this is what we getting, a different sound of STRYPER. A lot of bands tried to change their style of music to capture the current listeners whom prefer the Alternative Music but I tell you what, it won't work. I don't mean that you can't change, yes you can but don't use your old band name. Form a new band or solo (side project). We are the listeners of the 80's sound and we prefer to listen to the old style. Look what WARRANT, SKID ROW, POISON and other band who changed their music did, we will never buy their album again."
1,Disappointing return for a once-great band...,"One of my favorite bands throughout the 80's, I was psyched to hear that Stryper was doing a new record after 15 or so years. But once again, these old bands (Ratt, Dokken, Def Leppard, etc.) don't get it! Why try and incorporate today's music trends into the style of music that made you popular? I don't want to hear drop D tuning, no guitar solos, monotone vocals, and that's pretty much all you get on this record from start to finish. My wife (who was a huge Stryper fan as well) just turned to me and said ""every song sounds the same"", and they do. Very Disappointing!!!"
1,Big disappointment,"When I first heard the news of a Stryper reunion I was very excited. Man, I loved that band. When the day finally came that the cd arrived I stopped all my activities and listened to it with my expectations way too high. (So I know now)I read a lot about the sound of the cd. Honestly, I haven't actually noticed. (How bad for a musician...). But the songs...uninspired and cliche from the beginning to the end. All chords, no cool riffs. No heavy and fast guitar solo's. A lack of choirs, what we love the band so much for. And maybe worst of all...Stryper easily messed up one their best songs. What a horrible version of In God We Trust! I have heard the cd three times and that is quite enough for me. So I can honestly say they delivered a very disappointing album. There isn't one song that I really like.It is a funny thing that I read a lot of reviews on this album and they are so completely different from one another. Maybe that's the power of this album."
4,Terrific Comeback,"This is really actually a pretty great comeback album by 80s Christian metal band Stryper. It took me a few listens to really get into it, and I thought it was great. I was really impressed by The Roxx Regime 1983 Demo, poking fun at their sound and image which I actually thought was really good. At least they can laugh at themselves. All the songs, each individual track is really good, with second and last tracks standing out. Stryper wisely chose to update their sound on their comeback album which went to number 111 on the charts, very impressive considering thousands of albums are released each week, so this was in the top 200. Sure, it might not go platinum any more, but the American charts are still sagging from 9 11 attacks. It's cool."
4,Stryper comes back!,"We've seen them in concert, bought all their albums, as well as Michael Sweets albums. This is certainly as good as past Stryper albums, and better than some. It's a more matured sound, in my opinion, full of rock n roll and very much one of the best rock n roll Christian bands around."
1,STRYPER MISTAKES,"ACCORDING TO MANY SOURCES THERE IS A MISTAKE IN THE ORDER THE SONGS WERE LISTED IN THE BOOKLET MAKING THIS A ""COLLECTIBLE"" CD MAKING THIS THE ONLY REASON TO GO A BUY ONE AND RESELL IT LATER ON EBAY OR AMAZON. I WISH THE MISTAKE WAS TO HAVE AN INVERTED CROSS. IF YOU WANT TO HAVE AN IDEA ON HOW THIS CD SOUNDS JUST LOOK AT THE ALBUM COVER, WHICH MEANS THAT IS HORRIBLE: THE DRUMS ARE LIKE THE ST. ANGER OF METALLICA INSTEAD OF PLAYING DRUMS, THEY SOUND LIKE CANS. ANYONE COMPARING THIS ALBUM TO ANY PREVIOUS STRYPER RELEASE SHOULD SEE A DOCTOR."
2,Please put this away,"Why does a band like this have to come out with this release in 2005. First off, the sound is poor to say the least. In the 80's this had bad songs but still had good sound. That is all gone at this point. Maybe if they realize that God is just pretend, they might be able to make a better CD. That will never happen. Most of the fans think the same way."
2,"Not bad, not great","I was one of the lucky ones to have access to the demo of Michael's new solo album from a friend of a friend. Although I was never a huge Stryper fan, I did like some of their songs back in the day.Because of that, I bought this CD when it came out, and what astonishes me is there really isn't a whole lot of difference between this and the demo. I really don't think there's a lot of Oz on there (since he was never on the demo to begin with), there are some extra guitar fills but that's about it, and for that matter, there's no real difference in the drums. I wouldn't be surprised if Robert isn't even on it at all.As for the mix, some people have complained, but I like it a lot. I thought Stryper had too much of that polished 80's sound, this has a lot more of a raw edge to it. I don't think it would have been wise for them to try to sound like they did in 1988. They would have pleased their hardcore fans, but the name of the game is to sell records."
4,CHASE THE MOVIE,"I REALLY LIKED THIS MOVIE! IT IS DEFINATELY NOT ""THE MAN FROM NOWHERE"" BUT THE ACTION WAS GOOD.IT IS ABOUT A SERIAL KILLER WHO IS SEXUALLY DISFUNCTIONAL.HE HAS AN OBSESSION WITH PROSTITUTES WHICH ATTRACTS THE ATTENION OF THEIR PIMP WHO BY THE WAY IS X-COP. THE GIRLS ARE SLOWLY DISAPPERAING AND THEIR PIMP STARTS TO PUT THE PIECES TOGETHER FASTER THAN THE COPS. THE JOURNEY YOU GO ON WATCHING HIM GO ABOUT SOLVING THIS MYSTERY IS NERVING. A REALLY GOOD MOVIE WITH A FEW TWIST IN IT BUT AN ENDING WHICH YOU WILL HAVE TO DECIDE FOR YOURSELF. IT'S A MUST SEE!! ENJOY!"
2,"Well made, but could have been better...","This could have been a very good movie, but IMHO goes off the rails in the final act. The tone of the film shifts dramatically in a way that jerks the audience around more than it tells a good story. First you are laughing, then you are elated, then you are horrified and sad. It's more manipulative than it is creative and to me it felt a bit condescending.On the upside the premise is solid and the performances are strong. If it wasn't for the final quarter of the movie I'd have given it 3 1/2 stars.I expect many people will enjoy this movie more than I. However to me there is little more here than a generic thriller."
3,"""Ending sucks""","The film was very well done up until the anti-climactic end, which made me angry to watch all the way through."
5,Worthy,This is an excellent gritty crime drama from South Korea that is very long and involved. The characters are notable and complex and the antihero is very anti. I loathe to mention anything specific about a movie or book because it may spoil the experience for the art consumer but this movie is easily worth a watch.
1,Utterly annoying and inaccurate,"As a curent MENSA member, I find this book completely irritating and inaccurate! It should by no means be held as a traditional example of an IQ intelligence measure, due to the complete innanity of some of the questions put forth. Please find yourself a better-suited test of intelligence that broaches the lines of a half-way normal brain."
5,A student's opinion,"I am a student studying architecture, and have found this book to be a very useful reference.The first time I used it, I was looking for specific examples of ""expressive"" architecture. In the index, I found a long list of qualities such as ""grounded"", ""light"", ""dynamic"" etc. with references to pages illustrating specific projects whose structure has those qualities. The clear, full colour photos really help you get the feel of the buildings.I don't know of any other book that I could have looked to for that purpose. Of course, the content is useful for numerous other reasons as well."
3,honky tonk attitude,what a great way to describe joe diffie that is joe on this album he has a great song john deere green which i think is one of his best songs other than that i give this album a thumbs down
2,"Drivers hard to get, poor tech support","I was fairly satisfied with my scanner until I had to obtain a new computer, switching from Windows XP to Windows 7. The scanner's drivers will not work with Windows 7. I have tried to download new drivers but, for some reason, Fujitsu does not provide the full set of drivers on its websites, only a hodgepodge of updates. I have been trying, for 3 weeks now to contact someone at Fujitsi about this issue without any response. This is a long time to be without use of the scanner and will probably need to retire the unit (only two years old) and look for another brand with more reliable and accessible tech support."
5,"Bought one for business, then bought one for home","I bought one for a construction office where they needed to scan and send 20 to 30 page PDFs up to the main office every few days. The first scanner we bought sucked. Pages took for ever and the file size was huge (20 megs +). Then we bought the Scansnap. It has met our expectations. Fast, easy to use and it comes with a full version of Acrobat ($200+ value). After it performed flawlessly on the job site for the past four months, I treated myself to one as a Christmas present. I am running Vista on my home computer and after downloading the Vista driver all was fine. I am very happy with my purchase."
2,installation and compatibility issues,"This scanner does scan nicely, but it was a five hour install due toa. corrupt disc in the boxb. call to customer service, can't access their downloads with firefox (although they didn't mention that at the time)c. call back, need to use explorerd. finally get installed ... only to discover that the scanner's not compatible with my hp printer, and that I have to unplug the printer and do a complete reboot every time I want to use the scanner.It does scan nicely for the price, however. I'd be really skeptical of buying this product if I was running Vista, given my issues. I suspect your experience will not be pleasant."
1,Do not buy any ScanSnap if you have Windows 7,"Please note that until sometime in 2010 (according to Fujitsu) there will be NO driver support for Windows 7. So, if you have Win 7, steer clear of these scanners until further notice."
2,"Great scan, horrible feeder","This product does a great scan, but the feeder is junk. It constantly jams and tries to feed multiple pages at once. Not recommended."
5,It's a snap!,"This scanner really is fantastic. I have owned it for a month, and I am using it to scan old records so that I can be pretty much paperless. I especially like its ability to scan both sides of a document at the same time and in color. This scanner was ""a snap"" to set up, and the software is very simple. I recommend it. Worth the price."
5,What more can be said?,"I am a long suffering PaperPort 11.0 user. A very unstable and unsupported product that I used with a Kodak scanner to go paperless. A friend suggested the S510 as an alternative. I couldn't be happier. After loading a few of the included applications, it works flawlessly. I was able to replace our old Acrobat 5.0 with the included Adobe Acrobat 8.0. It's sort of like getting a $100 discount on the S510."
4,No Driver Support for 64-bit XP Windows!,"It's the best/fastest scanner you can find at this value and I will just mention the bad here.No driver support x64 XP windows, I chatted with Fujitsu tech and he told me to try the vista driver for S300 at my own risk. He also said they have no plan making x64 driver at this moment. I'm glad my laptop is x32 but the rest of my stations at home are all x64 as well as those one at my office.>> UPDATES 8/25/2008 <<Damien White says:I spoke with a sales agent online and they said that x64 software is available after registering. I just purchased one, so we'll see how I make out on my x64 Vista machine."
5,It's all true!,This scanner works so well I wanted to add my two cents. I've been scanning my home office documents for two years and I know what makes this a time consuming chore: 1) slow scans 2) paper jams 3) slow software 4) software that tries to help you name and save your documents (but only ends up making it a brutal and tedious task). Fujistu did a great job with all of these. I could not be happier. (One note: Don't bother installing the free trial of Rack2-Filer - it's pathetic.)
4,Happy with the scanner,"I am very happy with this scanner. I have scanned hundreds of pages. It is really simple. It does great with uniform sized paper. It doesn't like odd sized paper, but it does okay. In all it is an excellent scanner for the money. The included software is great."
4,scansnap s510 review,I have been using this scanner at work for about 1 month. It has worked very well for me. It does have some problems when you try to scan two different sized sheets together. It has a hard time determining the size of the second sheet but it will let you rescan the last sheet. Otherwise it has functioned very well and is very fast. I would rate it a 5 star but it is not twain compatible so you have to use the software that comes with it. This is not a big problem since the software does a good enough job.
4,Fast but Slow,"I love this scanner. It's small. It's EASY to use. Easy to set up. Scans jpg's and PDF's. Scans both sides. I use the scanner in a small business enviornment. We are small manufacture that ships LTL and full truckload orders all over the 48 states. We scan every invoice, every POD, and every anything that relates to running the business. Me best guess is 60-180 pages per day. I have found only two problems with the scanner. 1.) Unless you are scanning crisp fresh paper, the autofeed will only work with 5-9 pages at a time. Anything that has been tri-folded for mailing, don't expect 25-50 page autofeed. 2.) Non-standard size paper. We have a couple companies we work with that send dot-matrix invoices. These are 6"" x 9"" pieces of paper. I have not found a way to scan multiple pages at once. I need to scan them one page at a time. Due to these two issues, it makes the process a little slow. But when you place 20 page fax in the scanner, it is beautiful to watch the speed."
1,Feeder is BAD!,"The feeder jams at anything over two sheets of paper. If a piece of paper has a staple hole, the feeder jams. If a piece of paper was ever folded, the feeder jams. The manufacturer will not take the product back, so if you get one with a bad feeder you are stuck. I see all the great reviews, but my experience with the product has been very bad."
2,No Vista driver,Everything about this scanner is great until I bought a new computer. It looks like the company can't be bothered to write a new Vista 64 bit driver!
3,Only pdf's,I dont think it's a bad product it just wasn't useful for what I needed it for. The office software we use has to be able to scan in JPEG format. This scanner only scans in PDF. So it wouldn't work for us.
4,One of the best desktop scanners,Excellent scanner. Scans quickly and in color - also hits both sides of the page. A must for every desk!
3,Not for anything other than sheets of copy paper,"For the price of the product, and the advertised speeds and functions, you'd think all of your printed material could be fed into this scanner. You'd be wrong. Snapshots will jam in this device. You are locked into Fujitsu's software for scanning. And, you do not get TWAIN drivers for the device, so you cannot acquire images from this scanner when inside a program like Paint Shop Pro. This is a single-purpose scanner: feed it all of your sheets of paper, and it will convert them to PDFs. If you have a lot of paper, then this is your scanner. If you have a lot of mixed media, this is NOT your scanner. Find another automatic document feed (ADF) scanner with TWAIN driver support.-C"
3,Only one feature short of 5 stars,"The is a great scanner for converting documents to pdf. However, only has color and b&w; options, no grayscale. If you have grayscale documents to scan, this is a major limitation.Pros: Good design, small, scans duplex, comes with Acrobat 8.0 Standard (must register), scan quality good with slow speeds, works with VISTA.Cons: No grayscale mode as above. Minor cons: Document feeder sometimes takes more than one page, must use a carrier for odd-sized or newsprint (only one supplied)."
2,Great footprint - bad quality AFD,"I have been using the ScanSnap S510 for well over a year at a low pace; 40 to 50 pages a day. After 9 month, the feeder started to jam. I called the support center and they told me to clean the small rolls. It seemed strange to me as I don't use the scanner extensively. My HP printers are well over three years and I never had any problems with the feeder. After cleaning the scanner, I still had the problem and the only solution is to replace the parts.When it worked it was great but as soon as the feeder started to jam it became unusable to scan large documents (40 pages).I am looking for a replacement right now."
1,BROKEN FUJITSU,UNIT WAS IN SEVERAL PIECES WHEN ARRIVED. I RETURNED IT FOR CREDIT THE SAME DAY. IT'S ODD I RECEIVED AN EMAIL ASKING ME TO RATE THIS PRODUCT. I EVENTUALLY PURCHASED A CANON SCANNER. I'M NOT SURE WHETHER DAMAGE WAS DUE TO SHIPPING OR MANUFACTURE. SO I WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO GIVE OPINION.
5,The best thing in our office,"If you do any scanning at all, this is the machine to have!! It's easy to setup, scans and saves super fast. I wished we had bought one a long time ago. The automatic double side feature works great and as a surprise, it automatically turns documents the correct direction. It's so compact! Their is no warm up time so as soon as you open the top, it's ready to go.Hits: Fast and easy to use. No warm up time. Excellent quality. Paper feeder works well.Misses: Almost none. After scratching my head, all i can think of is their are a couple of consumables that have to be replaced once a year (or at 50,000 or 100,000 scans depending on the part) IT does look like you can reset the scanner thereby replacing the consumables when you deem it necessary."
2,No that great...,When I was piping the henna on it seemed fine but it started cracking and drying very quickly even though I kept putting lemon juice on it. After around 4 hours I got a very light stain that is now fading after only a few days! I wouldn't buy this brand again:( I have a lot left so perhaps adding some lemon juice or some kind of oil to the paste before applying it will help the end results. There wasn't a problem with shipping or charging so thats not the issue just the actual henna itself (imagine that!). So I recommend not buying this paste.
2,beachcombers henna paste,i think it sucks i never had suck a poor stain in my life really bad i was hoping for a dark stain instead it gave me like and orange type color very bad.
4,"Antietam, a study in people","This book focuses on the experiences of individuals and regimental sized units, and describes them in great detail. Generally, the various battlefield locations (East Woods, Middle Bridge, etc.) are described in a well organized manner, geographically and in time line. It is an excellent example of war history from the individual point of view. One small detraction is the maps. Unlike many books there are plenty of them, but they are somewhat hard to follow, and too frequently adjacent text refers to units that are not to be found on the maps. Overall, however, this book gives an excellent feel for the horror of this most terrible one day battle in the War."
5,"The BEST book from the ""Soliders View"" I have ever read!","Wether you are a student of the battle or just a ""weekend warrior"" this book is a must if the reader wishes to grasp the scope of the battle and a feeling of ""being there"". Mr. Priest uses a combination of first hand accounts and excellent maps to relate a minute by minute story of the battle. This is the only book I have read that gave me a true understanding of the sequence of different actions that made up the entire battle. Mr. Priest demonstrates a ""second to none"" knowledge of this conflict"
4,MORE THAN I PAID FOR..beats gave way to songs...,"When I bought this review I was getting real tired of the whole neo-soul hip hop sound, but I figured that I would pick this one up just to have in the collection. Just to be real, I got way more than I expected. This almost gets daily rotation, its so hot. The beats are A+ on 90% on the album. Lyrics on point, keeps you listening. The sound has that authentic underground feel that heads love without going overboard. Think Perceptionists or Little Brother with equal, or better production. If thats enough, just turn on your radio and contrast.You wasted enough time, now buy the album..."
4,a nice find,"a very solid album from 2005 that i just picked up on a whim after reading a review, rooted in the aesthetic of early 90's hip hop. i guess these guys are called 'the ay-bee's' now or something. whatever the name though i'm definitely anticipating their next release. these guys are in the category of groups like CYNE, giant panda, psyche origami, starving artists crew, and others who just make good rap music and are keeping that early 90's spirit alive. a purchase you wont regret if you're a fan of this type of rap."
2,On The Book of Psalms,"The content is likely written by an expert, but provided commentary on only selected portions of the biblical Psalms book. This was admitted to as well by the author - but one must read within the book to see this revealed. For the reason that it did not encompass the entirety of Psalm, the book was a disappointment to me."
1,Warning: misleading picture; not a proper wakeboard rope,"Big disappointment... just received, and the picture of the product suggests that the rope is one of the thin, non-stretching types which is NOT the case. The rope is a plain-old ski rope, which stretches, and is not designed for wake-boarding.Very disappointed - be warned."
1,Trick Handle,The trick handle for the rope came apart where it connect to the main rope. I contacted the manufacture and they sent me the wrong rope for replacement.
3,family game night,"bought for family game night, teens and adults. had fun but got frustrated because didnt get very many answers correct"
4,A Good Time,"I got this game to play with 5 other people during spring break, and we definitely all had a good time playing it. We split into two teams, guys vs. girls. It wasn't stupid hard like the ""Friends Scene it"" version was. It was a little challenging, but we definitely knew a lot of answers. Without a doubt a great party game. If you've got a lot of people both guys and girls, you can't go wrong playing this! This is my first board game review, but I give it 4 stars."
3,Could be better!,"I like the game, but it was alittle difficult trying to figure out how you determine the male questions and female questions on the DVD. Also on some of the reading parts you can barely read the items because they are a bit small. Other than that I like Scene It! games."
1,cumbersome,You spend more time playing with the DVD controls than you do playing the game. Many of the questions are beyond the average player--like what was the name of the record album--for fairly obscure groups.
3,It's very fun... at first.,"At first this game is very fun, but then it sort of gets repetitive. The questions are not very wide spread. I mean how many questions do I have to hear about Sex and the City? OK, I have never seen it, so that means I'll never get any female question correct? Even some of the men's questions were not obvious to me at all. (I'm a former college athlete, US Marine, construction manager, and I now work in a prison... so I kind of know all there is to being a guy!) This game is fine and will pass the time, but I noticed other players getting restless after a while, and I can't really blame them. I love the concept, but the end product is a bit of a let-down."
4,Squabble,Fun with couples or mixed parties. Some of the questions are odd but that's always a thing with Scene It games.
2,Questions Too Hard,"We found these questions, both on cards and video, to be way too hard. Unless you are a TV and movie junkie, the casual person will find this quite difficult. We would love to see a casual party game of this nature with fun, easy questions about a variety of things, not esoteric movie trivia as in this game."
5,Delightful regency novel,This is one of my favourite Georgette Heyer novels. It never fails to lift my spirits with her often dry but witty humour.Her heroines are strong minded and intelligent and her heros are men that don't need rescuing but are equally intelligent and strong willed. This is a well written romance wrapped up in silk.
2,Kindle version flawed,"The Kindle version of Regency Buck is riddled with flaws. Many missed spaces, extra spaces, oddly hyphenated words, oddly unhyphenated words, and other strange goings-on. It was very distracting to have an error or two per page.If you cherish fluent reading, this is not the version for you.Shame on the publisher/amazon for inflicting this on the unsuspecting reader. Extra care should have been spent on the Kindle formatting conversion. At the very least, someone should have read this version on a Kindle and attempted to fix the formatting flaws.Shame."
1,Could not get over his arrogance!,"I love Georgette Heyer and am quickly reading through her entire works. Most I love and read over and over. There are a few that I just make it through. This is one that I could not even finish. I could not get over Lord Worth's arrogance and overbearing demeaning behavior. And that Judith would fall for him at all! Maybe I missed something. It has been a while since I read this book, but even after all that time, I still felt as if I had to write something. I did not like him and could not watch poor Judith fall in love with him. There are so many other wonderful Georgette Heyer books (try Arabella) that it is a shame to waste any time on this one. Or at the very least, save this one until last to read."
3,Not My Favorite,"I am a great Heyer fan but this was definitely not one of my favorites. It was not as light hearted as most, at times it was almost depressing. Judith was strong-willed but she never seemed to get the best of her guardian.....not once...and after a while it becomes annoying. One could almost pardon Worth's superiority if it was lightened with a sense of humor, but he seemed devoid of any sense of humor, fun, or adventure. It is a good book of course.......Heyer wrote it.....but not as good as many others."
5,Wonderful Regency Humor,"Georgette Heyer has no equal when it comes to that wonderful brand of regency fun and laughter. Her research is so true to that age I feel as though I am riding in Hyde Park with the characters, or on the battlefield at Waterloo, Regency Buck lead me to read ""An Infamous Army"" And many of her other wonderful books. I have had to hunt in second hand book shops, and garage sales for the books I now have. Most are really dogged eared, and faded, and have pages falling out. I can""t tell you how happy, I am to be able to buy NEW - UNREAD - copies..where I am the first reader to leaf thru the pages of these wonderful stories. I hope to be able to purchase all of her works. She was one in a million."
4,My First Heyer,"Nearly forty years ago I bought this paperback, after staring at it at Woolworth's for several weeks, for the whopping price of 75 cents. There began my love affair with all things Regency, and Georgette Heyer's Regencies in particular.I am knocking a star off this because, though Heyer's writing craft is divine, her two main characters, in retrospect, are not very appealing. Worth is overly arrogant and Judith is childishly temperamental.What I will give is props to Heyer who, with the exception of the immediate Worth/Taverner family connections, used historical figures as filler. What a tremendous amount of research she must have done! From Worcester to Poole to ""Poodle"" Byng, she used real people of the Regency Era to flesh out the rest of her tale.Brava, Georgette!"
3,It's a start... Again...,"Finally, Season 1 has 'Started Over' in releasing ""Digimon Adventure"". For a moment, let's forget the simple releases that have been attempted by Fox and Alliance Entertainment and look at what we REALLY could have. It doesn't surprise me that they've only been able to show the first 13 episodes of the Digimon saga (Fox). This volume shrinks it even more to only 6 or 7. So, what's the next volume going to have? Probably 7/8 to 13. I won't be even remotely impressed unless they can produce the episodes that have never made it to public copy: Episodes 14 and on through Seasons 2, 3, 4. The only thing I crave more than ALL the Anime series I've collected is obtaining ALL of the Digimon episodes (Season 1- 52), (Season 2- 50), (Season 3- 51), (Season 4- 51). There are a number of episodes that NEED to get to DVD as are availible all over the U.K. and Japan. (Complete Box Sets)"
5,Fabulous!,"I've had them a little over a week and worn them every single day. These are exactly the boots I have been longing for, for years. Every other boot I've had pales by comparison. Would wear them to bed if I could. And I don't even own a horse. Lovely!"
4,Love at first sight,I absolutely love theses boots! I haven't stopped wearing them since I received them a few weeks ago. They fit well and are very comfortable after breaking them in a little. My only complaint is that they squeak quite a bit when walking.
1,Sole is disappointing,"Only wore these boots 4 or 5 times and when I returned home the other day it felt like something had stuck to the bottom; instead, there was a square inch rip in the rubber sole at the ball of the foot. I thought these boots would be a lot more durable."
4,For certain tools,Picture is deceiving . You only get the shaker. But it's still a good deal and the shaker makes it easy to use.My husband uses it in certain plumbing tools to make them grip.
2,Tiresome!,"This book starts out in a very promising manner--good storyline, interesting situation, an intriguing main character. About halfway through, though, the story gets predictable & dull, the main character (Joop) becomes a cardboard cutout of a despicable human being who lives only for his own passion for making chocolate, and the story just goes downhill. I started skimming quickly through the book just to see how it ended. The book just ends, leaving you with a bad taste in you mouth. Chocolate shouldn't do that! This book could have been excellent if the level of writing had continued throughout & the author had not reverted to stereotypical characters and a plodding plot line. Maybe next time!"
3,"Not the ORIGINAL ""Original Cast"" recording","This EMI studio remake has been a source of confusion for buyers ever since it was first issued in 1959. While it does reunite the four principals - Alfred Drake, Patricia Morison, Lisa Kirk and Harold Lang - ten years after their original 1949 Broadway recording, there has always seemed to me something a little strained and slightly faux about this entire re-production. On the surface they are closely following the original arrangements, including the replacement singers who assume the minor roles; but the feeling they project simply doesn't match up to the original, which is still available on Sony/Columbia SK-60536."
5,The Broadway Classic!,"One of the greatest shows in Broadway history, Kiss Me Kate is complete with witty book, beautiful, memorable score, and a little dose of Shakespeare. A play within a play, Kate is about a once-married couple playing opposite each other in a musical version of The Taming of the Shrew. I am currently in a community theater production of Kiss Me Kate, and it's a thrill to be in. Cole Porter's score is a dazzling work of art. I own this particular version, and also made an amazing find in Virgin Records (NYC) and found a two-disc recording of the complete Kiss Me Kate. I also recommend the MGM film soundtrack, which I also plan on getting. If you've never heard Kate before, buy this or any other Kiss Me Kate CD!"
4,Great jacket,"This jacket is comfortable and wears well. It does run on the large size though, I had to send the first one back and get a smaller size."
2,NOT freeze-dried corn,"If you are looking for freeze-dried sweet corn, you won't find it here. This item is basically half-popped corn, coated in oil. It is not sweet. It tastes pretty much like popcorn. Though advertised as low in fat, it contains 7 grams of fat per 28 gram serving. I'm not even sure that this product has been freeze-dried, like other Crunchies products.For freeze-dried sweet corn, I'd suggestJust Corn. Admittedly, I haven't tried any other brands. However, it is leagues better than these Crunchies, which I am now stuck with 12 packs of."
5,The best tasting GREEN SuperFood I've ever tried!!!,"I love this stuff. In the first week of taking it I immediately noticed a difference in my energy level. Where before I'd be lagging at the office, now I can keep my sustained energy up without eating sugar or coffee. I swear by this stuff and am a loyal customer from here on out! Thanks AMAZING GRASS.....(p.s. I started off mixing it with juice, and now I mix it with just water to avoid the sugars. It's super delicious, taste like a naturally flavored juice)"
5,Best of the best!,"This recording is not only on my top ten list of recordings that I would take to a desert island, it is also one of two recordings of Indian classical music that I recommend unconditionally to friends and listeners to my radio show who want to get started in exploring the music of India. Hariprasad Chaurasia's recordings are all exceptional - most are even stunning - but this particular performance by Hari-ji enters into a realm of sublime magic that enthralls with each and every listening. It is doubtful that any other recording of bansuri (bamboo flute of India) will ever come close to this performance. Enjoy!"
2,Eydie y el trio los panchos en la navidad...,"The easy swing with which this combination of Eydie and Los Panchos approaches every single song it touches is reminiscent of the spirit of giving that we all associate with La Navidad. I have and adore Los Grandes Exitos and the Christmas CD has all of the feeling and all of the joy and sensuality, and it is in Spanish! I have to say that the Christmas tradition here in the U.S.A. emotes somewhat differently (generally associated with snow and coziness in the Ol' Home Place) than it does for our somewhat warmer neighbors to the south, but nonetheless, what a wonderful way to get to celebrate the most grande of celebrations!!! Enjoy..."
3,Thumbs up Thumbs down,"Egan's tail does well to capture the beauty of the Pacific Northwest and inform his audience of some important issues. However, I found the layout of his book hard to follow and this made me want to put it down and stop reading. I also think that some of the chapters were overly long and repetitive."
3,Bias,A good book if you can filter out the evil white man vs Noble Red Man and Mommy Nature bias. To read this book you would think that no indian ever used a nylon gill net and that every inch of Western Washington outside of the National Parks is barren clear cut. He never mentions that most of the half of all available samon taken by the indians are gill netted. He never mentions that there are more trees growing in Western Washington now than there were at the time of Lewis and Clark.
4,"The prose can be excessive, but the subject is fascinating","As someone who was born and raised in the Northwest, I found this book to be a fine and insightful look at the region. Gossipy enough to tantalize, but grounded in a real understanding of the state's culture and history. My only beef with the book? I'm a fan of lean, but expressive prose and I felt that Egan too frequently used twenty-five cent words when a ten cent one would do. Still, this book is high on my list of great gifts for friends who live in the Northwest."
4,Great story! not boring!,"This book was a fun book to read. Unlike most history books, this actually told one man's story about his life growing up in the Pacific Northwest. He tells tales that he heard from his grandpa, and begins by finding the perfect place to lay his grandpa to rest in his home country of the Pacific Northwest. This book grabs your attention from the start, and it makes you want to keep reading because of the historical ""stories"", not historical information. I highly recommend this book to someone who does not necessarily enjoy reading large, history books, but they must enjoy fun stories about history."
4,A great western novel by a classic author,"I don't read westerns very much, usually I find that they have the same basic plot, no matter who the author is. However, I have always heard of Louis L'Amour because my brother used to read his novels. When I heard that John Wayne did a movie based on one of L'Amour's characters in a novel he had written, well first I saw the movie, which I liked, then I read the novel, which I really enjoyed.Hondo is a very entertaining novel. It has vivid descriptions of the harsh desert life where Hondo lives. It describes the tough life of a woman who is surviving on a desert ranch along with her young son. The novel also tells about the true desert warriors the Apache Indians. Mix all of these together with a very tough yet tender cowboy such as Hondo and you get a great novel as a result."
4,Another good LAmour western,"I like the directness of his writing, simple, to the point, but also full of description so you learn many true things from the stories. I always get pulled in quickly and hate to put it down."
4,Hondo,"I have seen movies based on the books by this author over the years but I am sorry to say that I had never read this authors work. I enjoyed this book very much. The characters were well fleshed out and the writing appeared to be faithful to the lore of that period. I appreciated the character of Hondo Lane, to me he epitomises the true western character. A loner, but a straight shooter with a gentle side. I also liked the fact that the author did not show the Native American in a stereotypical light. I am also a sucker for the friendship and regard for a man and his dog, and horse.The only true negative that I could put forth is that the author did write a largely static,romance between Angie and Hondo but still I found it to be an easy read, strangely compelling. I can see why there are so many fans of this author's work."
5,An American Classic,"Whether L'Amour wote this book from the screenplay, or vise versa, doesn't matter. This book is an American classic. This is my favorite of L'Amour's books, and the one book of his that will be remembered one hundred years from now. If you have any interest at all in frontier literature, you should read this book."
5,A great book and a great movie,"Hello, folks, I'm James Drury. I used to play the Virginian on television. I say this only to add a little authority to this review. If you haven't read Louis L'Amour, and particularly this book, you ought to build up the fire, sit down on your couch, and kick back. You are in for a treat. John Wayne brought Hondo to life, but he couldn't have done it without this book to build from. Wayne said this was his favorite Western novel, and in the world of Westerns we all trust the Duke! Make sure you read this book if you get the chance, and if you haven't read L'Amour and you take a liking to him you might also want to try Elmore Leonard, Elmer Kelton, Mike Blakely or Kirby Jonas."
5,Great Collection,This book contains a good cross section of Walker Evans' work. He has a great body of work and I could study his photographs at length.
5,Lindsay Wagner Does it Again,"Wow. Lindsay Wagner shows her talent once again in this movie. She makes any role she performs seem effortless. She must have done this one shortly after making the last season of The Bionic Woman. What a transformation!Jane Wyman is right on cue, too, with her acting abilities. One of her finest performances as well.The development between the two characters is inspiring. The movie is well written and even has it's warm and comedic moments. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in knowing something about those ""old mountain folk"" who aren't as backward as you might assume."
2,Hillbillies or Cavemen?,"As a hillbilly, I'm not offended by that term. I am offended by this movie, though. This collective group of hill people make the Beverly Hillbillies look like Albert Einsteins.The production values and writing are poor. The plot is predictable and cheesey. Don't waste your time. Just turn on the Hallmark channel and watch a couple of episodes of Little House instead. They won't be quite as ridiculous, but they'll hit ya in the same place."
5,This movie will steal your heart away.,"Beautiful scenery - the epitomy of dedication - Lindsey Wagoner is outstanding as a young doctor who goes back to the ""hills"" to bring modern medicine to the ""hill"" people who ""don't take to outsiders."" Jane Wyman as the ""Granny doctor"" is wonderful. James Wood as the ""sin-eater"" is spell-binding. This movie gives a wonderful glimpse of life in the ""back woods."" Heart-wrenching at times. A true classic. Get your ""hankie."" If you watch it, it will steal your heart away. It's one you won't forget......."
4,"Interesting movie...Modern medicine vs. ""Mountain"" cures","I saw this movie on tv years ago, and finally was able to purchase it on DVD. There were several very short pauses in the dvd when it appeared a commercial may have been inserted. Also, there were a couple of areas when the dvd briefly ""broke up"". But, I didn't think it was significant enough to warrant return. If you're into folklore of the ""blue ridge"" mountains, I believe this movie would interest you. Basically, a young doctor (Lindsay Wagner) suffers hardships when she tries to bring modern medicine to distrusting mountain families that were only accustomed to the natural cures given to them by their ""mountain medicine woman"" (Jane Wyman)."
3,British Zombie Women,"In case you hadn't figured it out, the ""zombies"" of this film are all the women of this little out-of-the-way town in Britain they have been infected with some drug/chemical and have attacked and killed all the men... along come these guys on the hunt for a good time and to cheer up a mate going through a divorce.Although not as funny asShaun of the Dead, it is still a pretty good zombie comedy.I give credit to the makers of this film as it's hard enough to make a good Zombie film. A Comedy as well is very hard to pull off. Bravo!If you're not a fan of the ""zomedy"", you should probably avoid as it's not meant to be taken too seriously.Saw it in HD on Netflix.It's not a laugh riot, but worth a view."
4,small tables,"I am pleased with my purchase of the two stack tables. It fits my need perfectly. I use one for a small lamp, and the other for a bedside table. I was also pleased with the price."
1,much over-hyped!!!,I am researching the field of faery wicca and was assured that this book in particular and anything by RJ Stewart in general was basically the best source of information. It couldn't have been more wrong advice. The book is an empty promise. It suggests that there will be more info lster in the book and then refers you to his other works (some of which I've read and they are no better!) Don't waste your money!
1,horrible book:(,This is the worst fairy book that I have ever read and believe me I've read lots of them. Kisma's book is a million times better then this one so you are much better off buying hers instead even though it is out of print. This book is boring and it is not worth the paper it was printed on. You will just waste your money if you buy it!
4,Good stuff,"There's lots of good stuff in this book. It's very sturdy and has a poem for every mood.But sometimes, it felt like it was missing some of the classic poems I was looking for, but I'm not a hardcore English or poetry studier. Maybe it was okay that it was like that.I positively loved the original sections that Palgrave chose, which are in the beginning, rather than the more modern poems.I liked it. I recommend it as a good starting poetry anthology. =)"
5,A Treasure,This is a beautiful collection of poems from many eras and includes some very well-known favourites as well as a few more obscure ones. It is one of the most comprehensive anthologies and an old favourite for returning to again and again. Beautifully compiled and so much more uplifting than many modern anthologies!
3,Delicate Wine Glasses,Over Christmas holidays I accidently broke one of my sister in law's wine glasses. I searched several websites and got the best price from Amazon to replace it. They can only be purchased in twos. These glasses are very thin and delicate. They do break easily but since they don't have stems they are easier to hold.
5,A Must-Read For Serious Students of Irish History,I am not sure why the previous reviewer only gave this book three stars when the review was quite positive.This book is really essential reading for any serious student of Irish history. It does a wonderful job of laying out the main historiographical debates over the last two or three decades. It should be the first stop for anyone writing an Irish history paper or conducting research. It is certainly geared towards the academic audience.
3,Competent recording of live TV performance.,"As with R&H's CINDERELLA, this was a live television event in glorious black and white. Once seen, (almost) lost forever. Both remain with us in cast albums and in kinescopes of the final dress rehearsals. This is a competent recording of the score, in no way remarkable, but also not bad. For those video enthusiasts who bemoan the fact that the 1950 MGM film is not on video (due to the Berlin estate withholding the music rights for video transfer as they dislike the film), cheer up - the black and white kinescope of the TV performance IS on video. An obscure company named Hen's Tooth Video released it in 1989. Probably not still being produced but worth trying to find through video rental companies - the performance is fresh and delightful and packed with musical numbers. If you can't find it anywhere else REAL TO REEL in Walpole, N.H. has a copy."
5,Perfect Version of AGYG,"Not to take a thing away from the original, but I think this version may be definitive, certainly better than the MGM film. It is perfectly cast, Martin, small town Texas gal..or Merman, loud mouth girl from the Bronx. Hmmmmmm. Merman was terrific, sure, but Martin is perfect, I think the best role of her career. Raitt is also perfectly cast and the recording is true to the original and is fantastic.!!!"
3,Not bad,"Well, I can't say much for this version. Mary Martin isn't very livley. She isn't really fun to listen too. I would sugest getting the Ethel Merman version of this CD."
2,Not the best,"I can't say much for Mary Martin. In the song ""Doin' What Comes Natur'lly"" she has no expresion. I sugest getting the Ethel Merman version or waiting until the cd with Bernadette Peters as Annie comes out."
4,Great gun,I recently wrote a review on this giving it a 1 star rating i take that back i just wasn't using properly. this is a great gun very accurate very heavy and good quality. This is a single shot but i found out you can do multi shot by pumping it 2 or 3 times.the one problem is the fact that when you get down to about 5 shots in a mag it wont fire. so a very good gun for cheap 4/5!
5,This Gun is Great!!,"This is da best shotgun 2 by. It has da best accuracy eva. It is lightweight,realistic,and cheap!!"
5,Great Gift,"This was a gift for my son and he loves it. Of all the gifts under the tree this year, this was the most coveted by all the grownup men in the family."
4,Very informative as well as entertaining.,"This book is a ""must have"" for the serious NASCAR fan. It chronicles most of the great drivers, car owners and crew chiefs from the humble beginings all the way to it's multi-million dollar days of today. The book documents the lives of such greats as Richard Petty, Curtis Turner, Dale Earnhardt, ""Tiny"" Lund, and many others. From humor to tragedy, the stories of many great men of NASCAR are compiled to give the reader a broad range of insights into the lives of these legends of the sport. I highly recomend this book to anyone who enjoys stock car racing. Whether the are new to the sport, or a fan of the legends, this book has something for everyone."
5,Great Book,This book was in great shape for a penny. I have not finish reading it yet but so far it is very good

4,veryinformative ideas for tax savings,this information saved us a lot of legal work and had excellent ideas for complicated exchanges.
2,Better Than A Sleeping Pill,This one of Lashner's lesser efforts. Dull and slow paced. Very disappointing.
4,What a sens of humor.,"Great writing, hilarious portrayal of Dr. Bob and his nurse. Give a copy of this one to your dentist"
2,Good untill the ending,"Good story, with good twists... until the completely awful, unrealistic, STUPID ending. Its actually annoying to have wasted so much time to come to such a completely fabricated and totally contrived finale. Its so utterly dumb."
3,Lacklustre patchwork attempt at a cast recording,"Froman and Stritch perform marvelously but the rest of theshow is rather a disappointment, suffering from performances,orchestrations and tempi that do not better the 1950 studiocast recording from Columbia. Here you have a slapdash shortoverture and two songs not on that recording (the forgettableCHICAGO and the melodic THE FLOWER GARDEN OF MY HEART). If youwant the extra material, go with the excellent recent studiorecording with Peter Gallagher and Patti Lupone. This hasthe supporting cast of the stage revival but not the leads-they appear in the 1950 studio recording. For Jane Fromanand Elaine Stritch fans only."
2,THE BOX CONTAINS 2!,"There are two filters in the box, not 1 as per the description. The Nissan Titan requires two filters so I ordered two boxes.The order has been shipped abroad and hence I have wasted about 40usd including shipping and handling for something I don't need..."
4,Love this album,I borrowed it from the local library. The kids didn't sleep though. They just wanted to dance.
1,Better than Ratt!!!!,They're better looking too! Sweet bunz on the singer........ohh baby! Chix dig 'em! They rocked my punjab! Hundefresh numberdynia.......gunjabi nacimentello
1,WHY! WHY! WHY!,"How could they do this!?They made Mena Suvari UGLY!How could they turn someone so georgeous into a trashy redneck!This is a weird movie that turns the most georgeous actresses into drugged up psychos! Yeah, I really wanna see Mena take a huge dump and get drugged up! The plot is stupid and it has no conclusion or turning point. It's just a sick movie about people staying up for days drugged up on Meth! Brittney Murphey and Mena Suvari should not have done this to themselves! Mena or Brittany, if you ever read this please stick top playing the sex symbol in a film!This movie flunked big time!"
3,out of my league,This movie isn't bad at all. To be honest I was liking it. But I have boundaries and limits and this was just something that disturbed me.
3,"solid at times, but takes character of a user","That is the movie filters the perspective of a methamphetamine dope addict and that is a detriment to the film's cohesiveness. That may be the point, but the film did make an attempt to tell certain storylines in a satisfactory way and I felt that it just didn't nail that down hard enough. In going for realism the writer's neglected to find a statement to be made about the behavior being presented. It's not that I feel every film needs that, but this one does. This film is a very dirty, rude, and lewd presentation of the life of drug dealers and their clients and it doesn't glamorize that lifestyle, which I credit the movie for doing. I just don't know why they decided to tell this story, to make this art. I know that this particular drug abuse is growing among kids, but this film doesn't have the kind of cautionary tale kind of vibe that other recent films have concerning this subject. This movie just makes me scratch my head."
4,Stylish,"This film was a big surprise for me.(Read above for the film summary).The film was well acted by all, especially Brittany Murphy, and the film was very stylish and imaginative (excellent use of animation during hallucinations). Directed by Jonus Akerland (who directed Madonna's Ray Of Light video), you can see he has a trade mark style -face paced, sped up imagery.Really enjoyable, gritty, funny and stylish."
3,Not as good as requiem for a dream,the movie showed u how sad and trashy the lives are for some drug users. the people in this movie made me sick. the way they lived and looked and acted and stuff but i guess it's true for some people. i didnt get what the movie was about though. it didn't really have a plot. it was just like a big trip for a bunch of druggies. requiem was better cause it was more serious and the acting and story was better but they used the same kinda camera techniques.
1,0 out of 5 stars,"A few words to describe this movie are: completely sick, demented, distrubing, nauseating, inhumane. We all know drugs exist and that people who are addicted to them live in messed up dark worlds of their own. But to make a movie about that, with no real point is completely stupid. This movie consists of no plot and no conclusion. A bunch of people stay awake for days while on Meth and the movie ends with them all asleep. If you like watching people crapping into tiolets, or getting strapped onto beds and left there for days to suffer, than this is your movie. About half way through this movie I felt completely sick to my stomach and couldn't even look at the cover afterwards. In my opinion, anyone who likes this movie is seriously messed up."
1,one of the worst movies of all time,"Jason Schwartzman (rushmore), John Lequizamo (collateral damage), Mena Suvari (American Pie), Brittany Murphy(Just Married), Eric Roberts(National Security), Mickey Rourke (Once Upon A Time In Mexico), Patrick Fugit(Almost Famous), Deoborah Harry (lead singer of Blondie) and Peter Stomare (Happy Campers) are among the cast wasted in this pointless and ridiculously stupid drama about scuzzy white folk with drug problems. None of these characters are worth it and the everlasting cocaine snorting, animated cartoon footage and gross out scenes, is just not worth it. Man what the hell was everyone thinking about when they signed up for this crud, ""uh I think I should destroy my carreer"" Requiem For A Dream was better then this and I liked that better then this. Ackerland is a horrible visionary and the writer is a horrible story teller. Horrible to the world horrible"
1,Blech!,"I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this movie.2 HOURS, I will never regain! I'm not sure what this movie was trying to prove or accomplish, but if it was to irritate me, it succeded. Tweakers, are some of the biggest piles of sewage in the world. Why someone had to waste money, time, and film that could've been used to make a good movie, to make a flick about them is beyond me. The only thing this movie proves, is that Britany Murphy should not be on any screen, anywhere, at any time. If you want a real life acount of these people, go hang out at your local auto parts store or 24 hour discount retail chain and observe."
4,Spun is worth a look,"Three complaints I often read about this movie is that it's dull, empty, and plotless. In that case it's a realistic representation of hardcore drug use. The meth addicts I've encountered really do lead dull, empty, and unexciting lives. If you want a glorified, over-the-top drug movie where the stoned main characters become action heroes, rent Pineapple Express. Spun tries to depict reality, not fantasy. The characters are stuck in dead-end lives and have little to no chance at salvation (despite this dreary outlook, the film is mildly amusing.) Great acting. The entire cast was very convincing in their roles as hopeless junkies. The unrated version is recommended."
3,Not the same movie I remember when I was in high school...,"Maybe I've grown up a bit, but when I watched this movie the other day, it wasn't nearly as enjoyable as I recall it being back when I was in high school. It does a great job with the way it's filmed to make you feel like you're experiencing the crazy high that the characters are. Yet, now that I'm older I guess I just find the story line unredeeming..."
3,not as good as you wold think,"I love John Leguizamo and Brittany Murphy both so I thought this movie was going to be really good. Although both of them act well in this movie, the movie still isn't the best choice for either of them. It is kinda of funny and a little crude. they are all spun out and they tried to show it with tricky camera work more than with the acting, you know... with bouncing eyeballs and stuff like that. It is fun to watch, but I wish I would have bought a different movie. It is good for a rental, but I can't see myself ptting it in to watch again."
4,Holly ****,"Short and Simply...This movie is is awsome.It's extreme hardcore addiction,pornograph,and crazy as ever cartoon scenes and just freaky,off the wall stuff.This movie will totally make your head spin."
4,images,"This film is filled with great short flashes of images...Good detail in set dressing for this genre...I suggest you just put on a good Pink Floyd album, and watch the movie in mute...Be a casual viewer, and let the scenes, and images just cascade over your mind...have fun..."
3,Honest look at the life of a tweeker - besides the free dope for rides.,"very honest, does not romanticize the drug like so many other movies do. heavy if you have a past drug history. If you don't it's probably ok. Will be funny to those who are still using speed."
2,What a joke,"A couple of warning signs should detract you from first off the movie stars Brittany Murphy. The other is that Jonas Akerlund directed the movie (Jonas' past experience with directing is with music videos.) If that isn't warning enough that you that this is a horrible movie the terrible story and the cartoonish characters (John Leguizamo apparently lives in a meth den, yet he manages to wear stylish gucci leather pants through out most of the flick) should be enough. There is also have the camera effects that Akerlund uses in this film in a similar fashion to those used by Aronofosky in Requiem For A Dream but only half as effective while being superficially glossed over.To sum it up it is just dumb, in the same fashion as most music videos are. There is little here to satisfy your head."
1,Mature Audiences Only,Parents Don't Rent This When There's Kids Around. I'm 18 Years Old And I'm Still Pretty Shocked. It Was Okay Till One Particular Scene With John Leguizamo And That Scene Just Turned Me Off. Rent It If You Must But Consider Yourself Warned.
5,"even the ""tweekers"" can relate",i love this movie. it's picture perfect in a life of a tweeker and their enviroment.WHERE IS THE SOUNDTRACK TO THIS MOVIE??????
2,Disappointing,"Don't let the intriguing cast and plot fool you- this movie is not worth your time. I found myself more interested by the music than the actual film, thanks to Billy Corgan, who did an excellent job(as always)and even makes a cameo appearance. If you're into the likes of movies such as Requiem for A Dream, definitely don't waste your time on this. It's not funny or realistic, nor does it keep one's attention. It tries too hard to disgust the audience and make them think it's fast-paced by using cheap camera tricks. Not to mention the characters and script are horribly underdeveloed. I still can't figure out why so many successful and talented actors and musicians actually opted to be a part of it."
2,crazy,"This movie is seriously ""SPUN"" unless you had a drug addiction to crank you would not understand this particular movie. the people in this video played their roles very well."
3,"""Requiem"" without the heart and soul (or realism)","OK - so speed freaks and junkies aren't one and the same. Still, these people (with the exception of Mickie Rourke, who is worth the entire movie), came across as almost cutesy. In the end, everyone falls asleep happily ever after, with their eye make-up on perfect! Come on, how realistic is THAT in the crank world? Enough said, the movie was highly entertaining, nonetheless. The lesser characters helped out a lot (Deborah Harry, Patrick Fugate, Eric Roberts and, of course, Rourke). Billy Corgan's soundtrack was perfect. If they just hadn't been so cute and cuddly and had such a happy ending, but, it was all right if you're looking for a little more ballsy American Pie."
1,RENT THE UNRATED VERSION,"The rated version is totally worthless. This is a good movie, but the editing on the rated version is so terrible, not to mention why would you rent a movie about Meth addicts anyway, if you wanted the PG version.RENT THE UNRATED VERSION!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Unoriginal, overdone, and S-L-O-W","I was visually nauseated throughout this film-yet sat through 75% of it because Mickey Rourke and Britney Murphy were interesting characters. Unfortunately, this film lost all credibility with me because it was trying way too hard to be ""Requiem for a Dream"".I was irritated from the beginning with the obnoxious noises and constant close-ups. It had many well-known actors and actresses in it-but this did not make the film any more interesting. The storyline dragged on- and became incredibly uninteresting after about 25 minutes. My boyfriend asked me why I was still watching it. He had to leave the room b/c it was driving him nuts. As far as the director, he needs to find his own style.Don't waste your time with this film."
2,not really how the addiction is,"So yes, like everyone else complains, this movie does kind of have a Requiem rip off to it. It does have some really good actors that do good acting and the filming is very decent. Kind of one of those movies worth seeing once. Basically it's about the lives of people addicted to Crystal Meth. HOWEVER, the movie fails to mention that the way these meth addicts act are the way that someone would act after using for long long time consistently AND they would have been sniffing a MUCH larger amount, not little bumps here and there. Spun does capture some of the aspects of what it's like to be addicted, but, in my opinion, it's obvious the writer/producer/whoever has never been on meth or addicted to the drug. SO IN A NUT SHELL, if you like movies, check this out, for the sake of it, but if you want to see a better movie about meth addiction and the way it effects people, check out Salton Sea."
3,Different,I thought it would be a little different but over all it was a okay movie! I don't regret buying it even though it wasn't what I expected.
3,awe crap,"AWESOME MOVIE...AWESOME ACTORS AND ACTRESSES, However.....DO NOT BUY THE RATED VERSION! This movie is absolutely pointless...every scene there is bleeps and parts being blurred! Take my advice and buy the unrated version, this movie is ANNOYING when every other word is being *bleeped* out, especially the speech on *bleep*...... ;) 3 stars because..hey, its still a kick *bleep* movie!"
2,Scratched badly,Didn't know it was gonna be so scratched it barely plays.. I did get a good price but I will have to resurface it to work right.
1,A drug film with nothing to say,"I usually don't write reviews about products. However, I feel that I should take a few moments and warn others about this film. Spun is a movie that should have been great considering the pedigree of its cast. But all the big names in the world could not save this dreck.The plotless film follows a bunch of meth heads as they snort drugs and act stupid. That is really the entire film. 90 minutes of the filmmaker showing us what we could already guess; that people who do meth are not only dumb, but become increasingly ugly and unbearable to be around.Sometimes a movie doesn't have a point per se, and I probably have liked certain movies like that. This is not one of those times. Spun has to be one of the worst, annoying films I have ever seen. Save your money and watch something else."
5,Right on the money...,"If you have ever tweeked or know someone who has, you will thoroughly enjoy this tell it how it is movie.. excellent...."
3,Walk on the Wild Side,"All I can say about this movie is it will definitely keep you awake and on the edge of your seat. (Think GO with a bunch of real drugs) The characters were a great mix and showed a rougher side to the female actors. I especially liked the raw way everyone was portrayed and nothing was out of bounds for this film. This was another example of a decent story line with the actors making it fun and edgy. If you don't like cussing and drugs, stay away. This film is definitely NOT a chick flick. It is for the serious film watcher who enjoys dark drama/comedy."
2,What Happened to BOC,I picked this up recently and was hopping to find more songs like Don't Fear The Reaper and Nosferatu - instead I heard songs that sounded a lot more like Asia... Sappy Pop Rock...If they included Godzilla and songs from Fire of Unknown Origin this would be a worth while collection.
5,perfect size and functional,"This is a perfect size and is very functional. It is also very attractive. I love everything by Le Creuset. I cannot believe all the complaints about the size...what did you expect for 10 OZ and how big does a Mortar and Pestle need to be? It is for herbs and spices, garlic etc and does a wonderful job for what it is supposed to do. I love it and encourage anyone interested in purchasing this item to ignore all the complaints . Buy it and you will be glad you did."
4,Nice But Small...,"I wanted this Le Creuset Mortar and Pestle set in Caribbean, for a little while. I finally ordered it but I didn't notice in the description that it's only 10 ounces in size. I was a bit surprised when it arrived. It was much smaller than I anticipated. I'm keeping it because it is fine for small quantities of spices, which is the reason I wanted it and it also matches the rest of my Le Creuset but it is very small. The upside of this is that it does not take much storage speace in my kitchen but I now have a Mortar and Pestle for those rare occassions when I need to blend (or crush) a few spices!"
3,Mortar,"I wanted one of these for many years, finally broke down and bought it. It wasn't as easy to use as I thought/expected. Garlic was hard to crush. However, it did crush the ""rosemary"" easily."
3,Small but pretty.,I can't say this is misrepresented. It does hold 10 fluid ounces at it's capacity. It will not hold 10 oz. with the pestle in it. I bought it for making pesto and it's not going to be big enough for that. It is pretty and for grinding spices it will be fine. I wish they would make a larger one and I would buy it.
2,Looks good; not functional,"This mortar and pestle looks great, but it's not really functional. The interior surface of the mortar is not adequately coarse for grinding herbs or nuts. In addition, the pestle is too short to provide adequate leverage."
1,Can't seem to get it to work,"This is very frustrating. I love UNIX and I wanted to get a little taste for it on my home computer since I only have access to it at work. Unfortunately, I cannot get this darn thing to load on my home computer. The OS is Windows XP. It starts to seem like it is going to load but I cannot use my mouse and a little bit into the loading process it starts to ask you about erasing your hard disk and without a mouse...it gets a little scarey. At least that is what I am dealing with."
2,Wasn't as convenient as made out to be.,"Not only was there a number of inconsistencies between the installation manual and the actual installation process, making you feel like you might be doing something wrong throughout the entire things, but if you install it on any drive except for your C drive (Or first partition, whichever) the bootloader can't find windows. I suppose if you wanted to use a boot disk for Windows it would be okay, but that's not quite what I had in mind when I bought it. I don't recommend this product at all."
3,"A much needed addition, now needing some revision","A New History of Florida has been a vital contribution to Florida history, especially in light of the extreme age of Charlton Tebeau's classic book on the state's history. The essays from a variety of scholars add much needed insight and perspective on Florida history from ancient times to the present, including most of the major trends of the twentieth century, when Florida really came into its own as the state it is today.Neverthless, this book has its shortcomings. First, the format tends to give an uneven, disjointed effect if reading this book like a textbook.Second, it contains material that can be found from other more extensive works. This is a good start for someone looking to increase their knowledge of the state, but only a start."
4,Overall a wonderful history of the Sunshine State,"Overall this was a wonderful history of the Sunshine State. Having have lived in Florida for 10 years dating from 1990 through 2000, I had the chance to witness a lot of economic, cultural, and developmental change. The final chapter of this book was more along the lines of what I was looking for...a history of modern Florida (1920-2000). While I did enjoy the book and it was very informative, I was hoping to hear more about recent events. Development and change in the State of Florida has happened at such a rapid rate since 1950 that about three quarters of this book seemed to be about another place! I guess what I was hoping for was more detail about land development and the growth of cities: Orlando, Miami, Ft. Lauderdale and the fall of the Everglades."
2,ungrateful,"This book made me quite angry. In the most general critique, the writing was mediocre. On the subject, the author complained throughout the book and was incredible ungrateful. For someone who was provided with two healthy twins on her first round if IVF, she had many things to complain of including the comment ""I will always resent my children being born via IVF."" I purchased this book as a resource and a means to help me through the choice of IVF and instead found a woman who cannot count her blessings and fails to see the beauty in what she and medical science has given her."
4,A personal account of In Vitro,"I found this book very helpful up until I was given then news that I did not get pregnant. In this book four couples became pregnant the first time out. One couple eventually gave up. Another couple was introduced off the cuff as the ""try again"" set they were not even given names, but referred to as wife and husband. It seems that a good quarter of the book is devoted to the pregnancy, which I never got to. I am glad that this book is out there. It covers the process and is helpful for positive outcomes. I did not find any solace in the negative outcome here. Also, all the couples are childless before IVF. As a person with secondary infertility, I would have liked the book to cover children during IVF."
4,Excellent Sermon Resource,"For the Pastor that need resource material to help in preparation for sermons, or Bible study on the Second Advent this is a wonderful resource. For the average lay person it is most interesting reading."
3,"Needs work, but not THAT awful","I'm teaching SAT math, and am finding these quick quizzes and problem sets helpful as warmups.I just had to put this for the record:While there are a number of errors, the situation isn't as dire as previous reviewers have painted it. Some of these are typographical errors which can be corrected easily from the context. The errors do not seem much more frequent than the errors present in the answer key in the appendix of your average high school math textbook (sad to say).The laundry list of errors compiled by an earlier reviewer has some errors itself. A sampling: The reviewer has confused ""subtract"" with ""subtracted from"". (Page 18, Page 149 #5) Page 133 #8 is actually correct. (You can check this by using FOIL.)"
1,This book is horrible!,"I saw this book in the store and thought I'd give it a shot. When I started working through it I began to notice blatant errors on nearly every page. At first I thought maybe I was losing my mind, or just a little tired and foggy-minded. But then I looked on Amazon to see if anyone gave it any reviews and I found that I was not the only one to notice these errors.I didn't think it was the responsibility of the reviewee to proof read and edit the material of the reviewer. This is despicable."
2,"Main math strategy: ""Plug it in"" (ouch)","The 2nd edition of this book seems to have fixed a number of the typos that other reviewers noted. But while the problems are nice (although far too few), the explanations are very poor.Algebra is a very rich subject, with a great many tools for solving problems, yet the author seems to think the best strategy to use is ""plug it in.""If the five multiple-choice answers have values, then the author recommends plugging them into the problem (essentially wasting up to 4x as much time as the problem really needs). If the answers don't include values, she recommends making up values off the top of one's head, and (you guessed it), plugging them in, THEN checking the result against the five multiple choice answers.On an actual SAT, the student does not have the luxury of wasting so much time! Plus, resorting to plugging it in demonstrates little mathematical mastery, which is what I'm wondering about the author of this book."
3,Character Actors Central,"One of the last entries, ""Mr. Moto's Last Warning"" (1939) remains the most widely seen due to its public domain status. Peter Lorre's formidable sleuth is matched by an impressive array of character actors: Ricardo Cortez, John Carradine, George Sanders and John Davidson. How can you go wrong? Despite its methodical pacing, ""Last Warning"" is a reasonably diverting mystery."
3,Quite different from her other books,"I read this book right after Ms. Martin's other book ""The Hampshire Hoyden"", which I enjoyed very much, unfortunately I found this was quite gloomy, timid, and slow for the first half of the book; The latter part was much improved, but was rather drastic at times, therefore, the transition wasn't smooth enough; it also lacked the wit and intelligence that I enjoyed from Ms. Martin's other characters.I do, however, appreciated the issues that author brought out, such as: the snobbish and shallowness of the aristocratic society, lack of recognition of the poor soldiers, and the disparity of the master and workers...The writer presented readers a romance from different angle which made this storyline unique. Like Ms. Martin's other stories, this also had some maddening schemes, but too bad, the spark just wasn't quite there."
1,elements 2 piece nested plant stand,"this came with the ceramic tiles busted, but since i was going to put a plant on it anyway, i never complained. however, i would never buy this product again. Warning to all who do buy this..."
3,somewhat boring,"This is written in your typical historical style. Which if you love history is great, but to the other who do not, it is somewhat boring. Hard to read."
3,Slow reading with topics not well linked together.,"This text is slow reading and the topics are not well linked together, however the repetitive nature of the writing style allows the concepts to be revisited and helps reinforce each topic. A strong class room instructor can manage the material, helping the student link the topics together. There is a wealth of information in this text for an undergraduate couse in aging."
4,social forces,"I used this textbook while teaching a college course, Social Gerontology. It was appropriate for students who had never taken any Social Work related courses before."
3,"Good, but not as good as her first novel","Gothic novels are difficult. The spooky surroundings cannot overshadow the romance, and that's hard when romance novels are typically character driven. Ms. St.Giles first novel, The Mistress of Trevelyan, is one of the most outstanding romance novels I've read. Her second and follow up novel, His Dark Desires, was a disappointment. Alas, I love her voice, so I bought her latest, Midnight Secrets. While it came very close to her first novel, it didn't quite capture the mix of eerie, ghostly suspense and strong characters. I've noticed she has more books coming out and I will buy them as I have faith she'll recapture the magic of her first novel.She is a talented writer with a beautiful gift to string words together like a fine piece of music. I'm a loyal fan."
3,This book is very difficult to read.,"This book is very difficult to read, not because of it's scientific content, which is very great, but because of the wordage, and style that is used in writing. All the charts are there, but it would take alot of study to make sense of all of it.If one wants to make a deep study of this subject, this book would be an asset to your library, however, if you don't want to have information coming out of the pages, this is not the book you want."
5,First Rate,"I've taken this knife on a number of trips through the White Mountains. Compact, sharp and versatile. Just the the right mix for the trail. M."
5,Best knife ever made,"This is a perfect knife. It is small and very practical, the combination of the blades is very good (blade, screw driver, can opener, and hole maker-carving tool). The size is perfect I have an old champion but is too large and you almost never use any of the tools but the knife and the screw driver. I like this one better is the perfect pocket knife. Plus the silver aluminum is far better than the traditional red plastic and it won't get scratch that easily."
5,The Soldier,"This is a GREAT knife. I won't go into any detail concerning the features, quality, size, etc. because that's been amply covered by other reviewers. The reviews here are very helpful, and certainly contributed greatly to my decision to buy this knife. I've never owned a Victorinox knife before, so I wasn't quite sure what to think about them.Let me just say that I HAVE owned dozens of pocketknives over the years, virtually every one of them more expensive than the Soldier, and I believe that the Soldier will now be the knife that I carry on a daily basis. It's THAT good!!! The features, quality and size are perfect in my opinion. All this in a $22 knife! Unbelievable!"
5,The Essential Swiss Army Knife,"This knife is the real deal! Most of your pocket knife/tool needs will be met with this knife and it exceeds all expectations. The quality can not be beat, as well as a fantastic lifetime warranty. The Swiss are master knife builders and this is truly a work of art in design too!"
5,Brightest and Best::Stories Of Hymns,"Father Rutler is a very great writer and uses language beautifully.This book is wonderful not only for its historical value but also the inspirational, it will give you a great insight into the true meaning of ""Sacred Music"" and a desire to investigate further the great treasure of church music, which has sadly been ignored, suppressed, and replaced by cheap TV like jingles. The History of Western Music begins with The Catholic Church. Father Rutlers command of the English language isun-equalled and may I add is a lesson in writing as an art form."
3,Industrial metal from the L.A. rock scene,"This 1994 5-track EP was the debut offering from Red Square Black, an industrial metal band from L.A. that featured Ozzy Osbourne drummer Randy Castillo and guitarist John Lowery (aka John 5). I'm not a big industrial music fan, so I'm probably not the best person to judge this album, but it strikes me as being less abrasive than Ministry, and less interesting than Nine Inch Nails. Still, for an early 90's L.A. band, they were definitely ahead of the curve.Square was the band's only release. If you're into industrial metal, by all means check this one out. It's certainly priced low enough to make it worth taking a chance on."
3,It's okay,"It's okay, but I found for it to be tight enough to use without counter balancing with a bag on the hook, that I had to have it on the part of the handle right where I want my hand to be because it's thicker there. Plus, it only fits on a horizontal bar so it's no good for an umbrella stroller. Only plus over others is that it's insulated and cute."
1,Not what I expected,I admit I've been out of the loop for a while on the Hip... I loved Up to Here... one of my two most favorite albums of all time... Road Apples was great too... this one... just seems hard to listen to... Maybe it'll grow on me... just very... chaotic...
3,Who knew lugubriousness could seem pretentious?,"I'm a big Hip fan and this is my least favorite (this may change, but I've given it about six listens and my interest has flatlined). Certainly, it's a world away from Phantom Power, one of the best records of the late 90s...Reading the lyrics to ""Music@Work"" enhanced my appreciation for it--there are some gems as usual--but TH's weightier references seem to be shameless bids for yearbook-quote posterity, and the music is remote: the vocals are generally buried (as often with TH, yes) and they almost seem to be caricaturing Jethro Tull, King Crimson or themselves.I'm torn over whether the absurdly gawky John Cage references in ""Tiger The Lion"" are unbearable or endearingly earnest. Three stars represent my hedging."
3,"Good, if not great album","I like a lot of this album, but overall, I'd say it's not quite as memorable as much of their last few albums. The title track is one of my least favorite Hip tunes ever, with its annoying, repetetive refrain ""my music at work, my music at work"". ""Lake Fever"" is a classic Hip song, but the performance and sound seems a little stale on the recording, especially compared to some live versions I've heard, and Gordie's voice is very strained during the outro section. ""Putting Down"" is very catchy, and I like other songs like ""Train Overnight"" and ""The Bear"" quite a bit, but many others seem a bit meandering and ho-hum. If you're not a long-time Hip fan, you may want to start by listening to Fully Completely or Trouble at the Henhouse, or their last album, Phantom Power, all of which are better overall, IMO."
3,Really big in Canada,"The Tragically Hip are really big in Canada. Their albums routinely go straight to the top of the Canadian charts, and deservedly so. They are endlessly creative, passionate performers of their own special brand of rock and roll. Sometimes, however, they can be a little dense. Okay, a lot dense. Music @ Work has some great tracks and some tracks that make you scowl and say, ""huh?"" The lyrics are often inpenetrable. Despite this, there is a special something about this band and lead singer Gord Downie. They are infectious and appealing. I give this album three stars. Check with me after another dozen listens; the rating may be radically higher."
4,"Song-for-song, their best work","The fact that this altogether excellent album suffered from relatively underwhelming sales confirms one of two theories: either listeners have begun to take the band's dependability for granted, or the multi-faceted system in place to promote quality rock music has faltered though sheer laziness and indifference. Music @ Work mirrors the structural strides made by the last release - producer Steve Berlin has been a godsend - while imparting significantly more aural interest. Variety is the key; a quick spin through the disk exposes straightforward rave-ups (""Freak Turbulence"", the tilte track), moody devastation (""Sharks"", ""The Bear""), big-guitar bombast (""Tiger the Lion""), and acoustic tenderness (""Stay"", ""As I Wind Down the Pines""). To be blunt, everything impresses and nothing disappoints"
4,A strange step to the side,"Each record by these guys sees them go in a different direction, but none has been such a wide leap as from the rocking Phantom Power to the laid back Music@Work. The end result is a laid back more rthymic record with much more of an acoustic feel to it then any previous Hip record. Take Lake Fever, one of the bands most unique treasures. The song starts out with an upbeat dance drum sound but then seamlessly enters into an acoustic melody without skipping a beat. Throughout Music@Work the Hip experiment with different sounds and textures creating not their best but perhaps their most interesting listen."
4,The Hip Come Through,"The hip have come through again, with another great album. Although personally I enjoyed Phantom Power better, that may just be because I haven't listended to Music @ Work enough yet.The title track is great, and listening to it once gets the tune caught in your head. ""Tiger the Lion"" is.... well different, but I found it cool because of that.Before I ramble on about all of the tracks, here is what everyone is reading this review for: The short answer to the obvious question is that Music @ Work is a great CD, and I would suggest any Hip fan buying it. As for non-Hip fans, if you didn't like the Hip before, you're not going to like them any better now. All in all, a great disc."
5,SUPER Album,I think that Music @ Work is the best music album all over the world but you cannot buy it in stores in Germany.
4,"So Hip, it almost hurts","In a week, when I have all the songs memorized, I will bump my rating up to a five, but on the first few listens, a solid four. A Hip album for Hip fans. As someone said, if you don't like the Hip, you're not going to like them any better after this album -- this is not entry level Hip (for that, might I suggest Fully Completely). But for a Hip fan, these 14 songs are incredible -- even the denser songs like Tiger The Lion and Wild Mountain Honey tempt you with the promise that, eventually, you'll get them, and you'll be humming along. Stay and The Completists are fantastic songs. Treat yourself. Enjoy."
3,The worst of human nature,"When I met C. Henderson, she said the book was a quaint portrayal of life in the area with a slight mystery and was very appropriate for all ages. Therefore, I was not prepared for such a depressing novel full of the worst of human nature: incest, rape, polygamy, kidnapping and baby-selling. When finished, all issues are unsettled as this book is to-be-continued. This book isn't for everyone. And I hope it doesn't depict the area in which I live."
1,Trash,"I've never felt strongly enough about a book to write an online review about it this book however deserves a comment. I'm an English major and for my senior thesis I'm actually writing about this novel. I'm a proud West Virginian and I'd like to say that this book is complete trash. As another reviewer stated there are numerous beautifully written novels about West Virginia that are based on facts that reflect the people that live here. I was shocked and appalled after i read it to see that the writer was actually from West Virginia. She should be truly ashamed not only for producing this piece of trash but for so horribly slandering her homestate. Breece D.J. Pancake, Pickney Benedict, Jayne Anne Phillips those are true West Virginia writers. Lee Smith or ""The Dollmaker"" if you like the Appalachian feel."
1,Read Jayne Anne Phillips Instead!,"As a proud native of the great state of West Virginia and a professional writer myself, I wholeheartedly agree with Ms. Shook from Morgantown that Ms. Henderson has only magnified the worst stereotypes of Appalachian life. Her subject matter is unsavory and her writing style very poor. To anyone who wants to read fine writing by a skilled West Virginian with fascinating stories to tell, I recommend the novels of Jayne Anne Phillips."
2,West Virginia stereotypes,"As a resident of the lovely and badly maligned state of West Virginia, I always look forward to reading a new West Virginia author. C.J. Henderson, a native West Virginia, took what could have been an opportunity to dispell the myths of the mountain people, and reaped profit from it. It was laughable, the prejudice and stereotypes this woman created with her charcters. I was extremely offended. The book should come with a label, ""Stereotypes galore! Come laugh at my state!"""
5,The best novel I've read in a long time!,"This author has such a nack for making the chractors and places seem real, that I was immediately absorbed in the story, which is what I look for in a novel. If I can't get absorbed in the story right away, I don't feel the novel is worth reading. I could not put it down. I will buy Cabin two as soon as it comes out. I'm that sure I'll love it. I hope CJ writes more novels in the future, she has a life time fan in me. I look forward to cabin two because I can't wait to see what happens to everyone next."
1,Who edited this?,"The subject matter of this book is appalling, but it was so poorly written I kept reading it to see if it would get better. It didn't. It sometimes seemed as if the author sat at her keyboard each day and just started out without checking whether she had written this part already or not. In a way, it is inspiring--if she can make a living writing this stuff, I can too, though I don't want to turn my own stomach.Yuk."
3,"Decent, but not on a par with King, Evanovich, etc.","The basic premise of this novel was good. Henderson especially does a great job with the ""mountain"" dialect. However, my opinion (and it's only my opinion) is that her ""city"" characters did not seem real. Their dialogue was quite stilted. Also, although basically a good story, the connection between Jacob and Jeb came as no surprise. I will probably purchase at least one more Cabin novel to see if the ""city"" characters become anymore realistic."
3,Cute but not a good fit,"These shoes are very cute and well made, however they are not a good fit for my child. Even though they are wide width, they still left a red mark accross the top of her foot. Her foot is thick at the ball of the foot, not wide in width, and these were just too tight. If your baby has the same issue I would HIGHLY recommend the brand See Kai Run. They fit wonderfully and are well made. Amazon has very good prices on them as well, just do a search for See Kai Run."
5,"Nice extension, no wobble","Installed this hitch extension on my 2"" receiver, and put a 2"" bike rack on this. Since this extender has anti-wobble device, and the bike rack also has anti-wobble, there is almost no wobble at all on the bike rack. This is the most important since the worry is always there that adding an extension will increase wobble, but in this case there is no problem.The anti-wobble consists of a plastic insert with a metal nut, which I was able to tap into the second slot so that the extension does not stick out of the vehicle as much. In this respect it is quite flexible.Definitely recommend this hitch extension to mount bike racks."
4,rack your bike around your spare tire,"Heininger's hitch extension is intended to provide you with a bit of extra room so that you can use a bike rack on vehicles where a spare tire (or some other obstacle) is mounted to the back and is not intended for towing purposes. It is more than strong enough to handle your rack and a full load of bikes and since it is relatively vibration and ""wobble"" free, it should perform extremely well during extended or long distance trips or even over more challenging terrain. It would be a great attachment for many trucks as well as RV campers, etc. Installation is simple and straight forward and fits a 2 inch receiver."
4,"Good deal, come with a wobbling stopper","The label on the box clearly says ""Not for towing"". This is used mainly for bike rack.Easy to install and quality is OK. It comes with a bolt and washer for securing the extension to your vehicle. The bolt and washer work together to prevent hitch extension from wobbling. So, it's like getting both the hitch extension and a wobbling stopper in one good price.In summary, it serves the intended purpose well with the addition of wobbling stopper. Good deal."
4,Works as advertised,"Extender provides enough clearance to accommodate the Rav4 spare tire and open the rear gate. The drawback to this item is that 1.) absolutely ""zero"" instructions included. I was confused as to whether the plastic anti sway insert was to be removed or not. Also, it leaves you to your imagination as to how the main mounting bolt the to be secured. I finally figured that one out. So overall it worked as it should but please, include some sort of instructions..."
1,misleading advertisement by Apex Batteries,"This seller advertises a kit for a price on Amazon but when one logs on to the external site, the price is for a battery only."
4,Not a bad deal!,"This is not a fancy, fabulous little gadget. It is more like a basic alarm clock radio with the cd feature. I like it mainly because it stores 2 alarm times and you can choose to wake up to radio, cd or the regular alarm sound. You can also choose the volume level of the alarm. The cd and radio sound quality isn't top notch, but it is acceptable. That is the only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars. I have had mine for 6 months without any problems and I use it almost every day. Maybe the other reviewers got faulty models."
2,Noisy in CD mode,This CD alarm radio is a nice looking unit and has all the features I wanted on it. The only problem is that when you play a CD there is a loud humming noise that is quite annoying. Try to listen to a CD at a low sound level and the humming will drive you crazy. If you just want an inexpensive CD alarm then go for it. If you want to listen to CD's as you fall asleep forget it.
1,What time is it?,"This clock does not keep time. It frequently jumps back to 12:00. At 4:45 one morning, it read 3:00. I'm certainly glad I had a back up alarm set. I am now having one heck of a time trying to contact Amazon about what to do with it."
1,Horrible Radio,"This is a horrible clock radio. When the radio or CD player is turned on, the device has a terrible buzz. It is so loud we can hear it through our baby monitor (this radio is in the baby's room). In addition, the clock does not accurately keep time. It runs fast. Within 2-3 weeks it is 2-5 minutes ahead."
2,Not worth the price,"This shoe rack is made of heavy particle board, not solid wood. I got something similar, but larger and made of solid wood for about the same money. This rack was harder to put together than the solid wood rack and isn't as attractive."
4,Mountain stream insects of Colorado,"This is a nice little book. It's not exhaustive and it is limited to mountain stream insects of Colorado (just like the title says!). However, there is an excellent introduction with some guiding principles of ecology and the illustrations throughout the book are excellent. I find it a useful compliment to other, more technical books - especially for teaching newcomers in the lab about insect anatomy. It's worth every cent, but it won't answer all of your questions."
3,Poor sound,"This DVD has poor sound reproduction, and does not have subtitles in English to help make out what is being said."
5,Fun,"My 3 year old little girl loves all these Dora toys, I have been looking for the baby twins for a long time, they are fun for make beleive."
5,Diverse and Interesting history of Japanese individuals,"Much has been written about the history of Japan from the point of view of society and group dynamics. This is understandable given Japan's interdependent culture. Mark Weston's Giants of Japan is one of the first that covers Japan from the point of view of it's great individuals. The subjects of the book range from well known industrialists (Konosku Matsuhita) and leaders (Tokogawa Ieyasu) to lesser known writers (Fukuzawa Yukichi) and directors (Ozu Yasujiro).The book is good for many different types of people. Those with a deeper knowledge of Japan can pick and choose from the individuals they wish to learn more about. Those newly interested in Japan can read the book cover to cover to gain a broad knowledge of the history and people of Japan.This book does not attempt to provide a comprehensive Japanese history, or in depth view of any aspect of Japanese society. There are other more suitable books in those genres."
1,"Poor navigation , buggy software with expensive updates.","I have owned this for about 2 years, and paid far more. Even at these lower prices, I strongly recommend against this product. Although the screen is beutiful, the interface is clunky and slow. The navigation does not direct you to the destination with great acuracy, often times saying that you have arrived when you still have 1/4 mile to go. The GPS location itself is not as good as even the cheap protable units you can get for half this price. The NAV-Traffic option displays the traffic information correctly, but does not route around traffic jams. The software is buggy, and the database is old. Updates have been non-existent despite numerous bugs, and when they are available, they cost hundreds of dollars. I've switched to a cheap Garmin portable GPS and it navigates much better. I suggest you look at one of those."
2,It will get you there if you have a lot of Gas,Routing on the Pioneer units really needs some work. I have a $400 Garmin that works way better. Mine will have me pass the road i should have turn on only to have me make a u turn and back track on the same road i was on and for a few miles only to turn on the road i passed 10 minutes before. This happens about 40% of the time. If you don't care about Navigation i would give it a 5 star rating for all the other feature. The only way you will be impressed with the pioneers is if you never owned a Garmin or just don't care about the navigation part.
1,"Avic D2, a total waste of Money!!!","I purchased my Avic D2 in 2006 and by 2007 I started noticing the touchscreen would not respond when inputing certain letters on the right side of the screen (R,T,Q). Then the space bar would not respond either. In time I could not use most of the characters or letters on the entire right side of the LCD. Now the ""OK"" is completely nonresponsive on the touchscreen making the unit completely useless. I regret purchasing this unit and having it installed in place of the stock unit that would have come with my YukonXL. I thought I was purchasing a better nav.system by choosing Pioneer's Avic D2 but instead it was a complete waste of my money! I've also read in different reviews that newer Avic models still have this touchscreen issue. Buyer beware, read all of the reviews you can find before investing your money on Pioneer Avic Nav. systems."
3,Keep or return?,"This would be a great shelf if I was able to put it together. Basically this shelf comes in three pieces. BUT it doesn't fit together. I think it would be a great shelf if only I can get it together. I'm not sure if I want my dad to sand it down to make it fit, or if I should just send it back..."
3,Over the counter sink,"Not very sturdy at all. Hoping to put a couple of small things up there as a decor holder, but my items were too big. Much thinner and flimsy than I thought it would be. It is still attractive though."
2,Kids not that interested.,"I got this for my girls, they did it once but didn't like messing with it. THey just weren't interested much with it."
3,"Good products, questionable delivery method","Products arrived on time and in good condition, and work as advertised.However, I have a major issue with how these two turkey fryers were delivered.They were delivered in the showroom boxes, not wrapped, and placed on my steps in clear view of a busy street in front of my house. I was very lucky they were not stolen, as I was not home at the time of delivery."
1,Are you kidding?,"I don't know why everyone is giving this product such a high rating. I guess they all work for Cendyne or something. This burner didn't work in my computer. I tried really hard to make it work by messing with the jumpers and IDE cables but it didn't work. i spent hours trying to make it work before i realized that this is just a cheaply made product. my friend suggested to me that i should have spent $50 more in order to get a decent burner. i realize now that if you spend at least $150, you'll get a burner that's easy to use and you won't have to go through the trouble of returning an inferior product. In short, i learned that you get what you paid for."
5,Good drive....,"This drive installed easily: just set the jumper to master, plug it in like the instructions say and boot up the computer. It worked 1st time out of the box, no drivers to install. Mine is reported as a TEAC CD-W58E drive in the device manager. Cendyne obviously gets these from a variety of makers. The included software with mine is NTI CD Maker 2000, similar in function to the Nero software. Cendyne has a forum for Tech Support on their website and also has helpful FAQs. My first test was to copy a CD I made on another burner, and it took about 15 minutes using the harddrive to image the CD. If you have another CDROM it would speed up the process to about 9 minutes. I recommend the Cendyne highly as a budget burner."
4,"Easy to setup, use but beware Hard drive Speed","I bought this unit three weeks ago. The install instructions were pretty clear, and the software drivers loaded right up. The Nero software is better than Adaptec for music because you can drag and drop songs, and re-compile them more easily than CD Creator. Beware, though your CD write speed may only be 1x or 2x if your hard drive cannot keep up with the music burn youll get ""CD Buffer Underrun"" errors. Cendyne recommends a separate disk partition for music. Overall very good for the money."
1,Lame,I was disappointed. It looks like it was created by an amateur on a desktop PC. It was hard to sing with. The family did not like it. Don't buy it.
1,Yet another Lear compilation,"I LOVE Amanda Lear, but lately all she issues it prerecorded and reissued stuff.What about her NEW song Copacabana, does that ever come out on CD, and her duet Paroles Paroles?This CD is great if you dont know Amanda Lear's work, and is a real pleaser, but for fans its old news, sorry"
1,How bad can it get?,"I love her, but this disk is absolutely horrible. The voice went years ago, and this is a poor attempt at music."
5,kylie does it again with another amazing album!!,"this album is amazing, she does it again. i have to admit it sounds alot like the material dannii's (her sister) album sounds like, you know that 80's dancey sexy sound. im just wondering why they chose slow as the first single, its kinda plain and doesnt give the rest of the album justice. she has definately gone away from Disco and has become this more sofisticated ultrahip 80ish with a touch of jazz sound thats different but good. its just to bad that she collaborates with cathy dennis on only 1 song ""after dark"", cathy produced almost half of fever. all i have to say is that if your a true kylie fan then this is a must buy!!!! im lucky that i got this cd first when i was in england, cause it wont be released in canada(where i live)till febuary. enjoy!"
4,A grower....,"I bought this CD as soon as it was released - I was excited at the propect of another glorious Kylie CD. That excitement soon turned to disappointment as on the first few listens it failed to make an impression on me. Boring elctronic rubbish I thought - over produced and just plain bland.Over the following months - listening to the singles released, I once again put Body Language in my CD player and slowly but surely the wonderful sounds hit home.Funky, hip, cool, retro. These words describe how I feel about Body Language. Shame the CD wasn't as impressive on first listen - if it was then it might have been more commercially successful. But for those Kylie fans who persevere you will come to appreciate the magnificance of Body Language.Kylie took a bold step with this CD. Whilst not the biggest commercial success of her career, it will certainly go down as one of her most daring. And for the most part, it works."
1,Terrible CD!!!!!!!!!!!,"This CD is soooooo bad. If you're expecting all the songs to sound like ""Slow"", you can forget that idea. I don't even know what type of sound she was going for, but all I can say is that it was a total miss. Don't wast your money!!!"
1,rubish,"im very good given to this album one star, only bcos is Kylie, but the album please if Kylie keeps doing this is better if she starts to do something else in different area like dancer teacher or something like that.BL is weak, all song sound the same... nothing different... boring .....xxx"
1,Bad Worse Worst!!!,"This album is plain boring and luckily it flops in the chart. Slow is officially the lowest-ever selling No.1 single in the UK. I thought Obsession kicks off with a good saucy start but it is then trash into another boring region of album-fillers. How can everyone keep comparing her to another Aussie popstar Natalie Imbruglia? She is a talented songwriter with deep thoughts and nice voice, and Miss Minogue is just a singer with no creativity. It shocks me real deep when I hear that she is releasing Chocolate as her third single. AND Gosh, how can she even get a Grammy for Come Into My World?No wonder Slow is the only single charted in Top 40 and stayed for 2 weeks before it dropped off the chart. AND covering (...) up this time is not the reason that your album flop in the chart, Miss Minogue."
1,if i could give this less than one star i would,"i should warn you that listening to kylie may give you the hives,anaphylactic reactions,boils, rashes, deafness,heart attacks,breathlessness and much more. So please take my honest and sincere advice and dont listen or buy this awful cd from this middle aged woman who just wont call it a day.avoid.minus twenty stars."
2,I'll pass on the Body Language!,"I'm not at all convinced about this new album by Kylie Minogue. I expected so much after her ""Fever"" album which was so pop-induced,with so many dance tracks. Kylie is trying to broaden her musical horizons a little bit too far to where this sound on the new album does not fit her at all. Don't worry though, her sex-driven image is still present but her good looks don't make up for the music here. When i heard the first single i was just heartbroken at how awful it sounded. So for any of you that are looking forward to buying this album, you're not missing much and that's only if you're expecting the same quality music Kylie has put into her other albums."
2,There are a few good songs......,"But overall, this album is very weak. ""Red-Blooded Woman"" is AWESOME, by far the best here. ""Slow"" is very weird but fun, ""Chocolate"" is her best ballad, and....well....that's kinda it. This album is overflowing with filler. Fever was better. James Mason OMG u should be a comedian dude....God I CRACKED UP when I read his review.....his description of Kylie's poses in the booklet's foldout are CLASSIC.....hysterical....and yet very true (read his review, it will make u LAAAUUUGH.....XD). He masterfully bashes Kylie where and when she deserves it. Anyways, ya, Kylie, you can do better. So do it!!!!"
1,pretentious piffle,please dont buy or even listen to this lousy cd from this middle aged woman who just wont retire.this album is an aural disaster which you should avoid at all costs.get any cd from the greatful dead instead.
4,Gonna Take A Few Listens,"I totally enjoyed Fever, and Body Language is another sultry, vampy release from this sexy Australian. Good dance tunes, a tight unit of music, all with a balanced theme throughout. I haven't found anything quite as intoxicating as ""Can't Get You Outta My Head""... but perhaps with another few listens, I'll find another fave on this release.."
2,nooooooooooooo,"been a fan of kylie's for years, and i couldn't have been happier than when she had success in america last year. she more than deserved it. but if she's looking for that success to repeat itself... i dont see it happening with this album. this album sounds like one loooong song. there is no oomph to it at all. ive had the import for months, ive listened to it several times but it is not clicking with me. no, i was not expecting fever part 2, but i wasn't expecting this let down either.boring!"
3,Eh,"I really, really, really liked Can't Get You Out of My Head. I think it was the best single of 2001 bar none and bought Fever. I was somewhat dissappointed in that one as well. Kind of bland pop that sounded a little outdated. Then, pop forward two years and I start hearing this brilliant song called Slow. Who does that I ask? Kylie Minogue, the bartender says. Oh, I'll have to get that one. Once again, the rest of the album is subpar when compared to the lead single. It's not totally bad, a couple of songs are good. Two stars for the album, about 8 stars for Slow,the best song again I have heard in awhile. FYI Neon Nights, by her sister Dannii, is extremely good and much better than this. Much more clubby and dancy."
2,Fever is much better !,"I was turned on to Kylie with the Fever album. Fever is glossy pop, danceable and slick with great melodies - addictive! When Body Language was released, I immediately bought it - what a disappointment! It sounds overly simple and filler-ridden. The single 'Slow' is a sweet minimalist grind, but that's pretty much it. If you're looking for a great intro to Kylie, definitely check out Fever."
2,This is not Kylie's best album-I Feel For You the best song,"This is not Kylie's best album.I would say probably the best song on there is""I FEEL FOR YOU""There are others that I like on there.I will still purchase the album because I am a Kylie fan and as a Kylie fan you can't seem not to buy the album and keep it for you other collections.I will still support Kylie with this album even though it is not her best album."
1,is it possible to give this less than one star,goodness gracious this album is plainly horrible from this aging woman who just wont retire.this lousy album from this awful woman is a classic case of no style or substance.avoid.get any jethro tull album instead.

2,Every Song Sounds the Same,"I like Kylie and I believe she is a talented singer, but this album is not very original or good. The songs all sound the same in my opinion. ""Slow"", ""Red Blooded Woman"", ""Promises"", and ""After Dark"" are the only really good songs. I wish she would return to her ""Light Years"" and ""Fever"" stuff and abandon the R&B- a white Australian woman really shouldn't sing that."
1,I have a new coaster...,"I bought this cd for ""slow"", and hoped the rest would be the just as kickin'. After being brutally disappointed, I offered to give the CD to some guy working at the McDonald's drive-thru, but apparently he had taste and refused."
1,THIS CD WILL MAKE YOU THROW UP,"THIS IS ONE OF THE LOUSIEST ALBUMS RELEASED IN THIS MILLENIUM FROM THIS CHEESY AGING WOMAN WHO IS A CLASSIC CASE OF NO STYLE OR SUBSTANCE.THIS AWFUL CD IS FILLED WITH STALE,CRAPPY SONGS WHICH YOU SHOULD AVOID AT ALL COSTS.GET HIGH VOLTAGE FROM AC/DC INSTEAD."
2,Not that great,"I just bought this CD, and I was pretty disappointed. I actually only liked 2 songs out of this whole CD, and after listening to them a couple of times, I just got tired of it. Overall, the songs all sound alike and are not that great. I would ask for a refund."
5,hooked once again,"I discovered the Euro Kylie Minogue when the single ""Confide In Me"" was being played on MTV in the U.K. in 1994. I immediately bought the CD and have never turned back. It seems like all of her CDs have longevity in my 6-disc changer, and Body Language is no exception. Highlights for me are ""Slow"", ""Still Standing"", ""Promises"", ""Red Blooded Woman"", and I am mesmerized by the oozing ""Chocolate"". Of course having seen her in the Money Can't Buy video currently on satellite Freeview just reinforces my love for some tasty chocolate. (If you think the red dress in the CGYOOMH video is sexy, you should see the one for Chocolate)The entire album is heavily influenced by smooth R&B, and although it won't please everyone, her continued growth in music will keep me happy."
2,It sucked!,"I'm not gonna lie I tried to give this a chance, but didn't think it was that great. I thought they picked some decent beats but other then that there was nothin there. I thought most of the songs were boring, too girly, and not that great. Compared to Fever, i thought this album was awful! And can see why it tanked in America. She really should have had some really uptempo tracks on this cd that would have made it alot better. Chocolate, boring. Red blooded Woman, ok. I mean seriously? when you have britney spears, gwen stefani, and countless other carbon copies in America that actually sound decent this stuff doesn't really stand well in the us. If there was a dictionary word for bad pop music this album cover would be on it!"
4,A Great CD!,"Wow! this is very different from Fever. She has now gone into a more dance territory. I love it. She has grown over the past 4 years! I loved the cd, but i didn't love all of the songs. My favourite songs from the disc were Chocolate, Promises, Secret(Take You Home), Red Blooded Woman, and Loving Days. She has proved to have more emotions than her previous album, and she has grown even more into a more mature woman, and you can tell that through her songwriting. She talks about her past with James and her present boyfriend, Olivier. The songs prove to be more sexy and they are all very upbeat. Great job Kylie!"
5,BETTER THAN FEVER...,"if that's possible and it is. Only this is a slow burn with lots of heart and Oh so sexy. It may well take a second listen to let these complex little gems sneak up on you. But believe me they will! CHOCOLATE and LOVIN' DAYS are truly Beautiful Tracks, just outstanding!!!! PROMISES, the infectious SLOW, RED BLOODED WOMAN-this record will knock you out and when it's over you have to spin it again. Don't know what it is about Kylie, you just want her to win whatever she does. This record does not disappoint those of us cheering for her. It's something to be proud of for it is a most excellent follow up to the incredible fever record. This is Pop For The grownups. Kylie has never been sexier with so much heart! Buy It. You won't be sorry."
3,Not terrible.,"Not great either. I'm a big Kylie fan unfortunatly this album is just OK. The material is slower than her previous album (FEVER) and not as catchy. The album does have its good moments, the very sexy CHOCOLATE, the upbeat SECRET, the very erotic SLOW and and the catchy RED BLOODED WOMAN. The fact that this album is so so doesn't change my opinon of KYLIE and i'm still a devoted fan. EP"
1,crap,"This is the biggest load of crap evermore, it was forced on me by my manager when we were restocking our shop.It sounds like a deranged chipmunk on helium moaning along to a casio keyboard.(...)1 star for animal impersonations."
1,Boring Language,"She can't really sing, but when she gets good songs to sing that is only when she shines. She's got some really dud ones here however, sounds like its a game of trying to keep up and stay relevant instead but there's no substance to this album, it sounds like she's trying her damned hardest to relive past glories but her thin whiney voice really spoils it. If kylie could actually sing I think I would change my mind.No matter how many of her fans try to turn me on to her they won't ever succeed in making me her biggest fan. She's had a few ok songs but she hasn't got anything special that makes her stand out. The CD cover also put me off, because at first I thought she was a drag queen. Gasp!"
3,OK....NOT ONE OF HER BEST....,"When I first herd the song ""Slow"" I imedintly fell in love whith it and rushed off to the store to buy the albem.Its ok,It wasnt as good as some of her previos work but I think the people who mixed the albem could have put a little more efford in to it.Is sounds to POP-ISH.It kind of reminded me of Janet Jackson,but never the less,it is still a good albem,and the vocles are exilent-a kind of Britney Spears-Cindy Lauper-Madonna feel to it."
5,We Will Not Lose Kylie To America,"This is one of the best albums ever released - fact!I cant help worrying though though that her American label are trying to ""Yank"" kylie up a bit so that she makes them a few dollars in the states.In the Uk we have loved kylie since the 80's. We supported through her though times, then all of a sudden Fever does something wonderful in the US and they all love her -WELL YOU CANT HAVE HER - KYLIE IS OURS SO GET USED TO IT"
1,Kylie Needs Body Armour for Body Lanuage,"Word of mouth could kill this release. I dont know one friend who likes this album, and we are all long time Kylie fans. At the height of a magnificent and joyous career, when Kylie can choose to work with probably ANY songwriters, we get this. The gorgeous electro of the opening track Slow fizzles really quickly into soulless filler. Red Blooded Woman is catchy but pure sub-Destinys Child, Chocolate is virtually unlistenable, Obsession, I Feel for you, Someday, After Dark should never have been recorded. There are just so many filler tracks, and the rap on Secret (Take you home) is embarrassing. Do yourself a favour and buy the Australian release of the new greatest hits (and DVD) and Light Years and Fever, but avoid this."
5,fabolous,"Having gotten reaquainted with Ms. Minogue a couple of years ago when Love at first sight was all over US radio, I started getting her albums that were not released here in the States, in anticipation of the Fever follow up. Yeah, Body Language is not as poppy sounding as Fever, but it works. Best of all is Slow which sold me on the album even before it was released here in the US. While you are about getting this, also pick up the Hits Plus compilation.Peace out."
2,Diffrent album,"Good songs - Slow, Red Blooded Woman, ChocolateThe rest is bad very bad. I hope her next is like she used to be."
3,Expected More,"I bought ""Fever"" after downloading a few tracks (yes I will admit to downloading them) and thought it was an amazing CD, and I couldn't wait for this CD to come out. But even though ""Body Language"" is a good CD, I just don't like how most of the CD is not-quite-as-cheesy-sounding 80s dance. There are different styles on it(Kylie even raps on one song) but since I am not a fan of 80s music, and this CD has retro 80s all over it, I can't give this higher than 3 stars. Kylie Minogue does seem comfortable on this album - then again, she became a worldwide dance diva with this type of music. The first single ""Slow"" is a catchy song but if you are looking for a ""Can't Get You Outta My Head"" or ""Love At First Sight"", you will be disappointed. On the other hand, if you like retro dance music with more sophistication than most of the crap that was out back then, you will love this CD."
1,shoddy language,"word of mouth could kill this cd, and it isnt selling well in the uk or australia. 'slow' is a great electro opener and then it is downhill fast to filler after filler. 'red blooded woman' comes from the sub destinys child template, and the last 2/3 of the cd should never have been recorded, rapping on one song (dire) and the hyper helium breathy vocals on 'chocolate' are overwhelming, and not in a good way. if the usa needed new music from kylie, why not release Light Years in the US and save us from this A&R driven soulless filler. cant wait for the NEXT kylie album when she goes back to doing what we love her for, which isnt this. buy 'light years', buy 'fever', take a trip on the new greatest hits dvd, but dont bother with this release"
5,Kylie is HOT,"Kylie has returned from Fever with Body Language and this is her best cd yet. Very big risk to take as it is sooo different from Light Years or Fever but this is the album to make Kylie a Superstar in america. This album is destined to be number one in the USA and produce a string of #1 singles which is what we need to keep Kylie releasing albums in the US and hopefully tour here someday. I was worried about this album upon reading several reviews from long time fans but once I purchased this I was Blown away, yes it does take a couple of listens to fully appreciate the album but once you give it a chance it will not leave your cd player."
4,THE RETURN OF POP MUSIC,"For those of you who are wondering what happened to pop music. This is it. This album has a refreshing lack of duets withJay-Z and Jah-Rule. In fact, not a single appearance by a rap artist anywhere on this album. This album is light, fun and easy to listen to. It's a shame that in the U.S. it is so difficult to find variety. Hip-Hop and R&B have their well deserved place. It seems if you want something different, you need to look elsewhere."
3,WHAT'S UP,"Half of these songs sound like they are not finished. All breathy vocals and goofy lyrics. ""Slow"" is the best song, becaus it acutally sounds original. But the rest sound like they came straight from the 1980's. In fact, this cd sounds a LOT like Danni Minogues's recent cd ""Neon Nights"". All you fans that are on the fence about buying the import version of this should think twice. I'm sure when the cd hits stores stateside it will be 9.99 at places like Target or Best Buy. Much more worth the price. Don't worry about the extra song that won't be on the US version."
3,If you don't have Fever and are thinking of this...get Fever,"Don't know what she was thinking on this one, Fever really re-peaked my interest in Kylie since the 80's, CD was top notch, almost every song was enjoyable and brought something new to the picture. With Body Language, it seems Kylie has been influenced by the bigwigs, I really wish she had kept with the Fever feel. ""Slow"" reminds me of a Britney Spears song, and the rest is not much better. She tries to add some soul but it comes out sounding quite generic.Kylie, I love you... make me want to jump up and dance to your pop style next time... I'll be waiting!"
5,HOT!!!!!!!!!!!,The petite Aussie's best disc so far. How can anybody not like this gals beats and vocals.Very Highly Recommended...Ciao
3,Body Language hmmmm,"Well I'll come out and say that I have been an avid fan for anumber of years now and have stuck with her through all her changes during her career but this album is not the greatest she's done.By no means is it a bad album but there are no stand out tracks that would make this a must have purchase. Light Years had Spinning Around, Fever had Love at First Sight but Body Language just doesn't have it. Slow which everyone in the UK raves about isn't an amazing song and I think had any other artist released it as a single it would been a spectacular failiure but she manages to pull it off.If this is your first Kylie purchase then I recommend the album Fever or the album simply titled Kylie Minogue with the excellent Confide In Me and Put Yourself In My Place. Great Popular music is something Miss Minogue does very well but this electro pop album sounds similar to her sister's Neon Nights album by Danni Minogue."
2,HER FEVER HAS MOVED INTO A BORING BODY LANGUAGE.,"Minogue is back with ""Body Language"". Too funky, and no beat.The songs just muddle into each other from song to song. With the first single ""Slow"" which barely peaked into Billboards Hot 100 Singles at No.93 and fell fast, was slooooooow and boring.Her next single ""Red Blooded Woman"" is a little more upbeat, but this funky sound that Minogue is trying to do doesn't make sense.An Australian white woman trying to be Superfly doesn't bode well.She should of stuck with her ""Fever"" roots doing more dance songs like ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"", she would of had more American pop success. She had her chance coming of a Top 10 smash, but ruined it trying yet again to change her style and become Sly and the Family Stone.Not very good at all. I give her 2 instead of 1 stars because she is Kylie Minogue, and has lasted many years in this business, however listen to this album first before you buy it, it is not at all like the Kylie we know."
4,Body Language - Kylie Minogue,"I was surprised at how much I liked listening to Kylie Minogue's latest CD. Although it may not win any song writing awards (tongue planted firmly in cheek!), it IS great background music, as one of my friend's noted.The music is great for when you want something with a fast beat, to keep you awake.This is pure, saccharine fun!"
4,Is Slo Motion worth double the price??,"This import version is double the regular US issue CD and has only one bonus track instead of the two the US version has. However, the track Slo Motion is excellent and probably twice as good as either of the two US bonus tracks. Out of the slower songs on the CD, this is definitely the best one.You can't fault Kylie or this CD, as it's got your hits, near hits, and misses. You like an album to be at least half good, and this one is exactly that. Slow, Secret/Take you Home, Sweet Music, Red Blooded Woman, Obsession, and Slo Motion are the best of the CD, with the rest being decent, but average at best. No real turkeys on here, as with her last CD Fever. In my opinion, Red Blooded Woman is the best track on here, with Slow being 2nd."
3,"The problem with ""marketing""...","Simple. This is what happens when marketing becomes a bigger part of the album's content, than the music itself.Don't get me wrong, I own all but 2 albums of Kylie's, being from the UK originally, but find that this,while being ""different"" for Kylie, doesn't sound that different, minus Slow and Red Blooded Woman, than any other US based, pop/dance female recording artist.When playing with 5 different friends, at different times, the question was ""Is this xxxx?"", instead of ""who is this? It's great."" the latter of which, has been the response to the previous two albums of Kylie's."
4,Adorable Kylie!,"La bella Kylie Minogue nos sorprende con un material fresco, fusionado en ritmos con tonos electricos y con tonos de blues, es una produccion digna de admirar; y aunque esta lejos de sus anteriores producciones Fever y Light Years, promete mucho que esta adorable cantante pruebe nuevas tierras y se anime a continuar su carrera por diversos rumbos. Para los que no aprecian las evoluciones y cambios simplemente no escuchen este disco, y para los que saben apreciar la musica y sus variantes y ritmos disfruten Body language y vivan de cerca una produccion personal y especial de Kylie."
4,"dont want to rush it, let the rhythm pull you in...","body language takes fans on a funked out electro bliss r&b excursion that only Kylie can do.the album is less euro house dance grooves and pop hits a la light years & fever and heavy on subtlety and seduction. Kylie takes us on a sophisticated and very sexy journey. She raps, she whispers, she sings, and the music is awesome.Anyone who can get the chemical brothers(slow) and narcotic thrust(red blooded women) to remix her singles,have both hit #1 on the dance charts simultaneously in the usa & uk and get scritti polliti to sing on a song(someday) is doing everything right!"
1,uggghhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!,as sais by many previous reviewers this is one of the worst releases of this millenium.this stinker of an album from this aging pop poseaur is even worse than her other cd's and i would strongly recommend you to stay far away from this and all her other cd's and dvd's.no stars for such crap.anyone who gives this bimbo and her album more than one star is a crackpot
2,no no no no nO NO!!!!!,"I bought this album for 20 bucks as an import in December, thats how much I wanted this album. It sucks. Plain and simple. Apart from SLOW, it sounds like songs left over from a really baaad '80's album. She wimpers and whispers her way thru song after song that sound like one another. Not long after, I bought a 2 cd disc of KYLIES Greatest Hits, which is much better than this crap. FEVER was also much better. Too bad. I really want to like KYLIE."
1,This is a huge disappointment,"Words cannot describe how dull and boring this CD is. I expected another great dance CD from Kylie, instead she decided to do more of a bubble gum pop CD. ""Slow"" is the only good track on the CD. Other than that, all other tracks are just awful with the exception of one ballad. Just like the name of the song, this CD is just that....SLOW! Don't waste your money on this if you are looking for her to have anything reminiscent to ""Fever"". If you like bee bop....then this may be for you."
1,deplorable,i can bet a hundred bucks that my dog makes better farting sounds than her singing.only a loser can give this piece of crap more than one star.all the songs are bad and do not merit a listen on this cd.throw this stupid coaster in your trash can.get any album from the grateful dead instead
1,h-o-r-r-e-n-d-o-u-s c-r-a-p,kylie is without a doubt one of the worst singers in today's music world along with jessica simpson and britney spears.this album is awful and even more terrible than her previous crappy album fever.avoid this old woman and her cd's and dvd's.get any cd from the allman brothers band instead.
1,exile this awful woman!!!!!,will somebody exile kylie from the music buisness please.it is a aural torture to listen to her albums which are full of filler material songs.all the 16 songs are cheap with terrible beats and banal lyrics which would not be appreciated by mature people.avoid this like the plague.get ghost in the machine from the police instead.
2,Subpar Kylie,"With no lead single quite as spectacular as ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"" (from Fever), Body Language is a much less impressive effort. Although tracks such as ""Slow"" and ""Chocolate"" offer solid beats and grooves, there is very little lyrical or melodic substance. Most of the album is a pleasant collection of mood music, with a retro 80s feel and a fabulously glossy package. Sometimes style compensates for substance - and it almost does in Body Language."
4,It's Just Fun Music,"When I purchased this CD, I thought ""Slow"" would be the only song I would like. I was pleasantly surprised. I am not a big pop music fan, but this CD has opened my eyes to a new style of music. It has enough variety to keep the listener interested. Most of the songs are upbeat and fun. They do not sound repetitious. If you want depth and meaning, then this is not the CD for you. However, if you want fun, upbeat music that makes you want to dance in your car, then buy this CD."
1,Fairy Tale Macho,"With two tours in Viet Nam, 3 years teaching at the Naval Academy and experience ""fighting"" kites in Borneo, I feel qualified to say that the author wrote this drivel without even the most rudimentary research. He has no idea what he is writing about, waxing eloquent in his ignorance to fill pages with stereotypical ""macho"" nonsense. If you like shallow, macho fantasy set in a setting you have heard of but couldn't recognize from the book, this may be for you."
2,Horse Play,"The plot line, story and characters were good I just couldn't get into the book due to the writers (Diehl) style of writing. I had first read 'The Hunt' by Diehl and noticed it then but I thought I would give Diehl another chance especially with the plot line which interested me enough to try it. Diehl goes off on tangents and has very long sentences.Very tough to read. I will not read another Diehl book."
5,Interesting read,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, it was well written and the plot kept me interested. Having lived through the Vietnam ""War"" and it's stateside aftermath, the character's actions and attitudes seemed quite believable. I definitely would recommend it to older readers who are familiar with our conflict in Vietnam."
5,THAI HORSE,A great read. From beginning to end it just kept picking up speed. Couldn't put it down and sad to see it end. This is three for three with me with William Diehl.I rate The Hunt and Eureka as really terrific reads as well but Thai Horse was best.
1,This book is lousy,"My hunch is this is a cheap sequel. Not a lot of discussion, just a lot of (regression) results reporting. Extremely repetitive. Moreover, given that this often verves into being fairly social science (as opposed to pop), the causal linkages seem pretty poorly established. If you want to read this for professional reasons (social science or urban planning), most of this could be ignored; if you want to read this for personal (i.e., recreational) reasons, it's really boring."
1,Good Voice - Weak Material - Bad Production,"As www.cdbaby.com only publishes ratings with at least three stars, here's the chance to tell the world that this is really a bad album! OK, Kelli has potential and she's really good on albums by Incognito, Philippe Saisse and on the early Count Basic albums - but her solo efforts are a real pain in the ears. Who the hell is responsible for the production? Poor girl got screwed if she paid a dime for that! The songwriting isn't much better. And the arrangement... horrifying!!Save your money on this one. Neo Soul at it's worst..."
5,I LOVE THIS CD!!,I Love Kelli's music and blast it everyday...as my neighbors can attest...she injects joy into her music...which brings smiles to everyone. Buy her CDS...she is on the verge of global STARDOM!!And check her out live when you can: kellisae.com
4,"Rent it, Buy it, but definitely See it.","The underlying premise is simple: HOW do we know we are real, or WHAT precisely IS reality? This movie can't answer that and after careful consideration it is obvious that NO ONE can. The safest thing to do is to fall back on Descartes' ""I think, therefore I am"". The alternative is lose oneself in a lifelong search for truth or possibly getting trapped in an endless loop of thought.Although there are better movies (even sci-fi movies) to watch this one is highly entertaining and well worth seeing more than once. My personal preference is in WIDESCREEN format."
4,*Makes You Think*,It was a very thought provoking movie.Not a movie for everyone.Sometimes its nice to watch a movie that gets you thinking.
5,A Pleasant Surprise! Much Better Than Advertised...,"I didn't even intend on renting this movie until I saw a favorable review in a Home Theater magazine. My impression was that the movie stunk after seeing the way it bombed in the movies and the way the critics ripped it. However I was very pleasantly surprised by the movie. It created an eerie environment that drew you into the flick, and is definitely worth seeing if you are intrigued by the thought of simulated worlds. Most people disliked it because of what it is not -- it is not an action flick like ""The Matrix"". So to some it will be boring because no one is dodging bullets. I really liked the concept of the movie and would recommend this as a rental."
4,If You Loved The Matrix....,"....you'll love this movie as well. I saw this movie only by chance after watching The Matrix, and I enjoyed this movie more.It's a spellbinding plot from beginning to end. And the ending will blow you away. I always love a movie much more when I cannot figure out the ending, or the direction that it might be going in. This movie will make you question your own reality.See it!"
2,No chemistry,"Slow, dull, and dark with a poor sound track. No chemistry betweem the leads. Special effects are rudimentary: at best."
1,awful,"This movie was a huge disappointment. It takes a wonderful concept(the idea that what we perceive as reality is actually an illusion created by scientists), and ruins it. The acting is mediocre (especially the detective, who is thoroughly unconvincing--at first I thought the character was bad, but then I realized that the actor just didn't suit the part), the representation of the technology is stupid (come on, didn't we get over talking computers years ago?), and the vision of the future with huge golden spires and whatnot is ridiculous. When the main character discovers that his world is an illusion, it should be horrifying, but it simply isn't, because it's badly directed. END"
1,Uhh no...,"This is your wannabe Matrix remake. With no-name actors and a bad story line. Some guy realizes that the computer world he ""visits"" is actually the real world and the one he's in currently is fake. Sound familiar? The special effects are sorry and the ending stinks too. Don't even rent it. The Matrix is much better. 1 star."
1,STAY OFF THIS FLOOR!,"This movie was the biggest piece of uh..ah..cake I have ever seen. I went to see this movie with a couple of my friends and not one of us could understand why we just paid to get in to this movie. It's like they took every thing that was cool about The Matrix and removed it,leaving a steaming pile on the cutting room floor. However if you are a big fan of this type of movie...you still won't enjoy it, STAY OFF THIS FLOOR, as a matter of fact DON'T EVEN GO IN THE BUILDING. HEADS WILL ROLL."
2,Rubbish,"First of all, no computer programme can create REAL people. You need a nervous system to feel anything. In a virtual world, there are no nervous systems. Characters in a controlled universe may act like they feel or know, because that's how they may be programmed. But they will never actually feel or know anything.That's the obvious reason this movie is a pile of self-important but impossible-to-even-consider-taking-seriously crap.Add to that the mindboggling extreme silliness about a character from the virtual world taking the place of someone in the real world, and you really must question: How the hell did this Matrix craze catch on outside of mental hospitals?3 out of 10 just for the crime mystery."
1,Incredibly predictable,"This was without a doubt one of the worst films I have ever seen. Incredibly predictable from start to finish, poorly written and acted, I found this to be a real waste of my time. I saw ""Comparable to the Matrix"" and ""Better than the Matrix"" reviews, so I had to see it... don't bother. ""The Matrix"" was a very good movie prevented from being great by Keanu Reeves' complete lack of any acting talent. ""The Thirteenth Floor"" was a poorly written movie bogged down by bad acting and poor characterization (although I'll admit there is NO ONE as bad as Keanu). Even cute-as-a-button Gretchen Mol couldn't bring this one higher than one star.I'll trade you my DVD of ""Thirteenth Floor"" for a used rental VHS copy of the ""Pokemon"" movie."
1,incredibly boring,"I'm all about action movies, and this is nothing like what I thought it would be judging by the preview. I thought there was gonna be action like the matrix. I don't know why people compare it to the matrix, it was about as exciting as watching one of those ""mattress giant"" commercials. So if you're gonna get this movie, I would also recommend Battlefield Earth and Galaxy Quest."
4,theres another world ontop of this one,"a man is murdered and a cop suspects a techman partner for his death, but what happens next is astounding and the finale is great too. the theory in here is that theres the real world set in the future and they create a game world of the real world which is todays world and then todays world creates a game that goes back into the old world and you can be who ever you want to be, plus theres a killer on the loose. hang on tight. D'Onofrio, Mol, Stahl, Haysbert and Bierko give nice performances"
3,Not bad...,"A friend suggested this movie to me and said that it was like the ""Matrix"" Unfortunately, the only similarity to the ""Matrix"" seems to be that it's science fiction, and it questions what reality really is. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the film because it kept my attention and was thought provoking. If you really feel like a suspenseful, thought-provoking science fiction film, then the thirteenth floor is worth it."
3,"Good, but could have been better","A very worthy sci-fi film, slightly let down by inferior acting and direction. The story is very interesting and the special effects are quite amazing - though 'The Matrix', both as a film and for its SFX is in an entirely superior league.However, this is certainly worth watching - especially if you enjoy sci-fi. The plot is fascinating, the twists and turns unexpected and clever and the film really is a brave attempt at a totally different kind of 'sci-fi' thriller."
3,DVD wasn't in th greatest shape,"Interesting movie, but wouldn't play all the way to the end. If I could have seen the whole thing, I might have given it a higher rating."
1,the DVD was damaged and won't play,"We saw a portion of this movie on TV and really wanted to see the whole movie so we bought this one as it was very cheap in the amazon listings.If we had any idea how damaged it would be upon arrival, we never would have started this whole thing. They should have thrown it out instead of offering it up for sale.Yes, they gave us a refund but it did not remove the disapointment after waiting 2 weeks for it to arrive and the additional upset of screwing around with the DVD as we tried to find a way to watch it.I would have paid much more to just have a copy of the movie that worked. Period.So I will never use this seller again as they probably have other cheap DVD's for sale that are trash. I do not want to go through the whole emotional roller coaster again. They are not worth the risk.Just getting a refund was not enough, there is no satisfaction in this at all."
5,Imaginative & super well done,"It's my favorite sci-fi movie. All story, no fluff. Loved the depiction of the edge of the virtual reality: woah!A box within a box within a box. We all need our minds expanded and to think out of the box."
4,A Thoughtful Virtual Reality,"Here are a few elements of this movie that might appeal to some people:Firstly, it presents a clearer, more sensible idea of how virtual reality works than its 1999 movie siblings ""THE MATRIX"" or ""eXistenZ"". And it does it thoughtfully, without mind-numbing action scenes and special-effects.Secondly, the virtual reality world of L.A. in the 1930s is visually rich, yet doesn't stray too far from a realistic look.Bonus extras are Armin Mueller-Stahl's, Vincent D'Onofrio's and Dennis Haysbert's performances, Gretchen Mol's lusciousness (also enjoyably down-to-earth as a grocery clerk), and exquisite direction and photography (Josef Rusnak, Wedigo von Schultzendorff)On the DVD, director Rusnak makes the accompanying commentary in the way I like -- he comments on what we're watching with relevent and interesting behind-the-scenes info.I rewatch this film (and film with commentary) frequently for these reasons."
3,"Great Movie, Disappointing DVD","I love the movie, but was really disappointed in this DVD! When I purchased it, I didn't notice that it was only the full screen version. Coming back to check on Amazon, it seems this movie is not even available in wide screen! (At least not in region one.) So many of the special effects shots are wasted in a full screen version. You don't really get the full effect. If they ever do a widescreen version I would buy it but this DVD does not do the movie justice.Another disappointment in this DVD is the lack of special features. This DVD is listed as a ""Special Edition."" Seeing that, I was expecting some good special features, but all it had was the trailer, a few still shots, and a VERY brief one-screen bio on the actors. That is not what I would expect from a special edition!I get the impression the DVD version was rushed together with very little thought. Sony, you can do better than this!!!"
4,"If you liked ""the Matrix"", this movie is much better!",It's a really good movie that for some reason did'nt do well in the theatres. I think that it is a must see. It's sorta like the matrix and dick tracy combined.
3,Who dunnit,"Skewed reality, or is it schizophrenia?The line between the real & the imagined is criss-crossed & blurred countless times in this well-acted sci-fi movie. It's interesting, fun, and quirky....but with Vincent D'Onofrio in it, could it be anything else?!"
1,"WOW, Don't Buy this one.",You really need to buy the Blu-Ray version of this film.What you get here with this old dvd is a cut-down-zomed-in version.Get the blu-Ray and you'll get to see the actual whole Movie Film.:D
3,Interesting But Confusing,"Other than raising some philosophical questions (that I think will escape most viewers) this film is really nothing much more than a curiosity. The ending raises questions all its own. Is it just sort of tacked on as a Hollywood type ending or what? A watery world & everything is quite peacefrully resolved for these characters after all the confusion? The film is technically well dome, but the story is a hodge podge. So many loose ends that the ending just ignores."
3,"This is still a good movie, but not up to today's standards","That said, I saw this in theaters when it first came out. Maybe a different decade, maybe a hot woman, maybe never seeing the lead actor in end up in scary movie 4. Something really hit home with me. Now, I see what terrible acting was involved in this movie. If you like movies for the concepts they deliver, you will like this one for going deeper into the sci-fi end of the matrix concept. Drama galore, film noir. Probably already seen it yourself or you wouldn't be looking at it on Amazon. Reminder, Vincent Denofrio is the only good actor in this movie... no brainer, right. And you should know not to purchase the 1.33 aspect ratio version like I did."
4,A quiet cyber-mystery in the land of the Matrix.,"Not an action movie as the trailers might suggest. More a cyber-mystery with a surpprise turn and an upbeat ending. A quiet Matrix-like movie combined with Murder, She Wrote. If you think there are internal inconsistencies it probably means you were not paying close attention to details and the theoretical construct, which you just have to accept. A new movie genre really. Seemingly predictable but not. Don't watch the trailers before the movie. DVD extras are weak compared to others, however."
4,Highly Engrossing and Entertaining!,"I don't know about other country's, but in Australia this movie was bagged by Critics and Audiences. It seems people either love it or hate it. I love it. It has the perfect mix of Sci-fi, Murder Mystery, Film Noir, Action, Special Effects and Plot twists. It has a brilliant story line and The acting in sufficient. An all-round great movie."
4,quite entertaining,"Requires some thought to enjoy, good plot, great film noire - much better then the Matrix, though I enjoyed that also. Reminds me in parts (just the ambience) of my all time favorite Dark City. WAY better then eXistenz."
2,Puts You Out,"I really enjoy Sci-Fi films and the whole cyberpunk genre, but this movie just didn't do it for me. The trailers for this film looked compelling, so I rented it on VHS, but after about 20 minutes I was out like a light. I found this film so dry that it put me to sleep. Look for your Sci-Fi elsewhere kiddies, this one is more potent than Niquil."
2,Horrifically disappointing,"The premise of the movie sounded good, the opening scenes were interesting and built what seemed like it was going to be an interesting premise, but the film quickly devolved into complete junk, with a twist ending so weak that it made the already mediocre film into a truly bad one."
2,Good Concept,This movie had a good idea behind it but it was poorly executed. That acting and directing was some of the worst I have seen. To my dismay that downfalls made it almost unwatchable.
2,"An interesting concept, but not very well done...","I found this film to be utterly boring and overlong and when I was watching it, I paid more attention to the 'Briteny-Spears-like' conversations going on behind me. It's not necessarily a rehash of the Matrix, but it's not nearly as good as that film either. It had an interesting idea, but the filmmakers couldn't keep your interest with it... There's just TOO MUCH ANNOYING DIALOGUE. Avoid."
1,"entertaining, but it's been done before.",If you've seen the matrix or Dark City then you've seen this movie. The story is slow and predictable. The film seems to rely on special effects which it has very little of. Character development is kept to a minumum. There isn't even a villain until the last 20 minutes and you learn little about him. This was supposed to be a straight to video release which apparently tried to capitalize on the success of The Matrix
4,Slow burning future cult classic,"It seems that many have compared this film to 'The Matrix'. I don't think that this is very valid as the actors in 'The Thirteenth Floor' earned less money and performed better. The special effects were more subtle than the crash, bang, wallop of 'The Matrix', and it seems from the other reviews published here that the the plot was a little too complex for the average viewer, so they have dealt with that by writing that it was lacking in story. This is far from the truth. The plotline sets those who can to think.I feel confident that it will become a cult classic with time as more see and appreciate it."
3,more than just the floor,"Despite the fair ratings that the people think of this movie, I would have to say that it actually wasn't all that bad. I think that the concept of a virtual reality within a virtual reality is great and sometimes more frightening than the world of the Matrix. Personally, I think that the acting held up better in this movie than Keanu Reeves' neo. Everytime I see Keanu I expect ""dude"" to come out of his mouth. In this movie, there is actually a more intelligent dialogue that allows the audience to actually think (Imagine that!). Gretchen Mol was perfectly cast in this movie and I think that the darkness of the film really enhances her beauty. All in all, I enjoyed it."
3,Good Movie- bad encryption.,This is a good movie dealing with reality on several levels. The scenes are recreations of Los Angeles from the 30's and are quite remarkable.This DVD does have another of Sony's odd encryption schemes designed more to frustrate the user than to protect the movie.
3,I'm not sure why people like this movie,"but they do. I didn't. story is kinda there but it just never did anything for me. a couple of mediocre effects and mediocre acting, maybe I was just in a bad mood that day- you decide."
1,"""Warning"" ""Don't Order From This Company!""","The video is faulty as there is static all the way through the video (No picture), and was not able to watch it at all? However I was very pleased that Amazon refunded fully the cost including Postage and Handling to me. Thank You, Amazon.I will not be ordering from this crowd again."
3,Very Predictable...,"I am a huge fan of Sci-Fi, but this was a little weak. The movie was beautifully done, and fairly well acted. But it was damn slow. Ther only good thing was the plot twist, in the middle of the movie, that I didn't see coming. But the ending was SO predictable a child could have seen it coming."
3,a little ripped off but still good,This movie was pretty good but it ripped off the movie strange days(which is definitly better). The basic plot in the movie is that this guy finds his boss dead and then goes into the thirteenth floor. I know it sound confusing but its not all that hard to follow if you keep in mind its a sci-fi movie. But if you want something similar to this movie go with strange days or the matrix there better.
4,Nice; not essenttial,"This typical RPG accessory contains a pad of character record sheets; a copy of the character generation scheme (with tables); a combat action summary; a magic summary (arcane and divine-no dark- lores) with name, casting time and number of spells; and a grimoire form for 16 spells. There is also an extensive name generating table for all four races, and ""inspirational Character Portraits""-read line drawings of old world folk.None of these are necessary, of course:(one could easily make up one's own tables) but they are convenient and well done. And the pack does add to the atmosphere of the game. I might have added a few more grimoire pages. The names are fun."
3,Bought it for the map,"I bought this product entirely for the map. The map is good. The rest is ok, but the GM screen is missing a few key tables. The adventure is decent but doesn't really tie into any of the other published adventures."
5,A new beginning,"This supplement contains the GM screen (very usefull) and a bunch of material that seems to be reprinted from the original version of this game from oh so long ago. So if you don't have the old main book, this is new material as well."
1,Poor Craftsmanship,I bought this pendant around Xmas and I was quite disappointed when I received it. It was poorly constructed.The Black Onyx is stuck on with glue to a base made of silver. The first fault I noticed was a crooked cross. This was because the Black Onyx wasn't aligned properly when it was stuck to its silver base. Traces of glue were left stuck on the sides of the Black Onyx which I had to clean off. The silver at the back also had some stain spots. It looks much better on the net than it does in real life. It was it bit embracing to give this cross as a gift hoping the person didn't recognise the faults which were quite obvious to me.
1,Beautiful Item but cheaply made...,I loved this cross its beautiful. But after 2 days of wear one of the onyx bars fell out. All I did was wear it and it fell out. Which tells me it was made very badly. For beauty I'd rate this cross a 5 out of 5. But overall because of poor craftsmenship I have to rate this a 1. I wish this was a better made product because I really do love it. I hope this helps someone to not waste their money unless they plan on only displaying it and not wearing it.
4,Unusually fast air flow,I installed this about 2 weeks ago and recently took a 3 hour road trip. The speed I was driving at was about 70mph and the air was flowing out of the vents as if the fan was on at about medium setting. I am not sure if this is correct or not because in other cars I have had in which I changed the filter the air did not flow out as fast. I am going to give it 4 stars because I don't know if this a problem or if the filter just works that good. I would give it 6 stars if it IS designed to let this much air flow through.
1,Zero Stars for What is Certainly One of the Worst-Ever Books for Children,"If you're even slightly intrigued by this book, I would really ask you to carefully read the other reviews with one or two stars. The ""poetry"" is vile, and the images are worse. The graphic depictions of a dog dismembering and disembowling a mailman were enough to make the adults in our house sick. The kids wanted the thing destroyed. The book ended up in our house as part of a book exchange; definitely not something anyone around here would've paid for.Worst children's book we've ever read and/or seen. The author and illustrator, a couple of cabin-bound Canadian sisters, appear to have some serious social problems. Doubt they've ever even been around children."
4,like it !,"Keyboard is great , like the looks of it ! The only thing I dont like , but is not a big deal is the usb plug , only one I had available on my tower was in the front , so it is in the way . But all around pleased with the keyboard !"
1,Utter garbage,"Keyboard misses keys, and has lag. It's difficult to type fast on. The keys are wobbly and mushy. Keyboard keys should not move until you actually press them. The keyboard doesn't even have any lights for caps/num/scroll lock.Mouse has those stupid tapered sides, not very comfortable. Feels sluggish. Weight balance is off.I don't know if this is common but my mouse also had a lot of glue coming out of the gaps. Every time I used it, I was rubbing off dried glue from it. Disgusting.The scrollwheel completely broke after only a few months of use - like its support snapped. Amazing. I wasn't rough with it.I don't feel comfortable even reselling it so that it can make someone else want to murder. Unfortunately I think it's just going to be tossed in the garbage to add to the endless pile of s*** the peripheral industry seems to like churning out as of late."
5,Love It!!,"The wireless keyboard and mouse were just what I needed! Now my desk is more organized, my typing speed increased with this keyboard, and the mouse moves well. The wireless range is great and the batteries last forever! Awesome product overall!"
5,My 1st HP purchase in a long time...,"...And I am here to tell you that this was an excellent buy. When I found myself needing a wireless keypad and mouse I had no idea which way to go, or how much to spend. For starters I'll confess here and now that I got my wife's hand me down system when she got her new sweet new gear. Although her's is ours, I grabbed up the old computer, an 03' Dell running XP and in need of a total mop job before I placed it in my Bomb Shelter in the basement. Hence the need for wireless, it sits across the room from me and my Kegeratior where it is shows me the world thru a Sharp 42 inch TV/Monitor with a Bose surround 7.1 speaker set-up. and then some...but the real winners are the wireless keypad and the wireless mouse. They have performed as well if not better than any set up I have worked with to date. There have been no lags or type0's. I strongly recommend this keypad/mouse combo, you can spend more money, but why?"
3,OK but not great,"Mouse sticks and I've only had it for a month or less. Slows everything down and very frustrating. I don't want to spend more money on another wireless mouse and keyboard right now so am just dealing with it, but I am not thrilled with this product."
3,"Interesting, informative, not very entertaining.","Very interesting information about corruption and politics in India's educational system. Unfortunately it's rarely an involving or entertaining movie; it never goes beyond polemics. Too bad, a good movie about the subject could be amazing."
2,Ok songs,"Not as impressive as we had hoped. My son loves the Cars soundtrack, so i thought he would like this, but it never gets listened to."
3,Kids liked it eventually....,OK songs....kid liked it after a long long time of sitting in the glovebox and as a parent one can stomach.
4,A PRETTY GOOD SHOW.,"So it's not ""The Music Man"". It's still a great little show with some wonderful songs, written in traditional Broadway style. Remember, this was 1960. Some of the previous reviewers who were so unfair and cruel probably don't understand traditional Broadway style. They undoubtedly prefer shows like the stultifyingly vacuous ""Phantom of the Opera"" or the perfectly dreadful cacaphonic ""Rent""."
3,unsinkable molly brown review,"i am disappointed with the dvd of ""the unsinkable molly brown' because it is coded for use in usa, not australia.i cannot play it on my player.is the supplier not aware of the coding restrictions that prohibit a dvd coded for use in one area being played outside that area?"
3,A British Molly ?,"The music to this show is very close to my heart having performed it in the spring of 1999 as J.J Brown. I was very pleased with Harvey Presnell's performance here but I was extremly disappointed with the casting of Molly... along with her heavy British accent. Although it does not include the song ""Colorado My Home,"" and Molly falls short of my expectations, this is a wonderfull recording with some great music."
3,Exciting book for young readers,I really enjoyed this book. My summer school students really had a lot of fun reading this book.I recommend it for all young readers.
2,"Well sourced, but a chore to plow through...","Authoritative, but pretty difficult to read. Instead of a linear narrative, the author breaks down each 20 year period by the political, economic and religious factors contributing to the overall situation. While this provides granular clarity to the subject, as a narrative it makes for mind-numbingly intricate reading & memory. As a research tool, this is top-notch. As a vehicle for the average person understanding the period (which was my intent) I can't recommend it"
1,Why would you pay $100 for this?,"You can get this exact same material FOR FREE. Legally, because it is public domain. Just take 5 seconds and Google ""FSI Spanish Programmatic."" Tada! I just saved you $100."
5,"YES, it works!","Aaaaaaah I wish I had a way with words so that I could do this product justice. This program is superb. If you are serious, yes you've heard it before, IF you are serious, this is the way to go. The negative aspects about this course are outweighed by the benefits 20 to 1.I have gone through this course and the 2nd one and now I have an excellent foundation to build on. YES you still have to work after the courses, but it's worth it!!!! When I talk to people time and again I am told ""I like your accent, it's not.......well it's not American"" or I am asked by confused faces ""Where's your accent?"". It will teach you to talk with little to no accent. I'm serious! And it will give you an excellent understanding of grammar making it easy to take on new words. Get this product and work at it! ¡¡¡¡Vale la pena!!!!"
1,Old material and horrible audio.,This is just a re-mastering of freely available material from the Foreign Service Institute. And it's not even the good FSI material. You can learn with this but the audio is very bad by modern standards and the material is very dated. The method is also down right annoying compared to more modern methods.[...]
3,"Being generous, not for everybody...","The songs on this cd are quite good. However, it is a cheap hits collection designed just to make some bucks. This one does not include ""Heaven"" but rather some slightly more obscure tracks (Train Train, Quicksand, Sure feels good to me). You can find this in most places dirt cheap (5 or 6 bucks brand new) but online merchants sell it for up to 30 so be careful. No new songs, just old stuff from the first three cds. Nothing new here and it is only for a casual fan who didn't like ""Heaven"" but may want to check them out. If you've never bought any Warrant, I suppose it is a brief and diverse introduction. There are better songs on the original albums but give this a chance if you are on a budget!"
2,same old stuff,"Every song on this disc is a five star number. But how many times are you going to release the same old thing? It's like Kiss Alive I, II, III, Greatest Kiss, Kiss MTV live, Kiss You Wanted The Best, etc., etc. You get the picture. Save your money and buy the original Dirty Rotten, Cherry Pie and Dog Eat Dog (which is exceedingly good). If you already have these, then wait until they actually put out new material."
2,what is the point of this?,"this album is a replay of what has been replayed. i listened to it once. it has good songs and all but why they would even release such a waste of time and money, i don't know. buy greatest hits, its much better."
5,East River - Sholem Asch,"wonderful book re: New York City immigrantion stories, re: cultures attempting to maintain their own ways of life from 'the old country,' while integrating into 'the new world.'"
5,A must-read in order to understand other u-boat litterature,"This book is great. here's why:1) Great disposition. Eases the reader into the subject. From basic to advanced stuff.2) Thoroughly researched. Based on original sources.3) Great pictures and u-boat layouts4) Contains tons of facts, yet it is still extremely reader-friendly and har to put down.This book has really helped me a lot when it comes to understanding every aspect of the uboat and the uboat war. A great aid when reading other uboat titles."
1,VERY POOR QUALITY,"I have owned this product for 2 years. I have replace it under warranty twice. The one I have now stopped working also, due to a loose or bad wire for the power to the unit. A lifetime warranty means nothing if you have to keep sending it in at YOUR expense. This has been a repeated problem with each unit that I have owned. They simply stop working. I recommend the Sennheiser wireless head phones that I purchased a year ago that operate on a better wireless system. You can buy them from Amazon. Good luck!"
2,Recording History,"Anna, A Friend of Mathias will be an inspiration to many others who have stories of their ancestors (particularly those who immigrated to the United States in the 1800s) that ought to be recorded for future generations. Such sturdy, courageous people as those in this book deserve to have their adventurous undertakings recorded with such care and admiration."

4,Classic review of industrial applications of LP,Dano is a key reference for those who are interested in the history of the application of linear programming to solve the problems of a variety of industries. The survey of applications primarily covers up to the 1960's. The information and sample problems in this book are hard to find elsewhere.
5,Epic music for my car,"If you've ever watched a movie with Charlton Heston in it, you've heard this music! Lovely stuff - they don't write scores like this anymore.I can drive AND pretend I'm in a chariot race!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"Won't hold posters, paper posters from teen mags, die-cuts using cardstock...to tell the truth, I haven't found anything it will hold. Too bad, because my daughter & I were really looking forward to her being able to 'decorate' her walls without making permanent marks in them. BIG waste of money! Plus, the liquid makes it wrinkle light weight paper and won't hold heavier paper. So, for scrapbooking it's useless as well. Great concept, but doesn't even come close to doing what it advertises. If negative stars were available for rating I would have given them -5."
2,This game stinks!!,"This game stinks, the body parts are all shaped like boxes, it's impossible to beat, I give this game 2 stars because I feel so sorry for it, people who are going to buy this I advice you not to.And being a megaman fan I am very dissapointed."
5,The spirit of anime distilled into wonderous CD form.,"Megaman Legends is probably my favourite Capcom title and a contender for favourite PSX title. It's a little bit RPG, a little bit action, a little bit puzzle...Capcom's developers DO know innovation, though you wouldn't know it by looking at whatever Resident Evil or Street Fighter Hyper Alpha Pink Mongoose 4 sequel is splattered across the market at this time.The game scares a lot of oldschool Megaman fans. These people do not want something new, they want linear level design with a cute little boss and a victory pose. Megaman Legends isn't really about getting to old Doc Wily or Sigma or who-cares-who and pounding his face until he stops being evil. The plotline is ""whimsical if kidsy"" as opposed to ""kind of a loose frame for murdering robot dudes"". It takes very nearly the whole game for there to be anything serious.Purchase this game and love it. Only a gibbering fool would hate a Megaman game for not being the same as the thing before."
4,Its fun...Depending on your view of it =P,"I liked this game. No, actually, I loved it. It was great to be able to play a MegaMan game in 3D but if your like me, you beat it in a day or two then get sort of bored of it. It was great that they tried making the game longer by giving difficulty settings after beating it but it just wasn't enough. If you really want to play a good game, this is one of 'em...but be prepared to finish it in a few days. After playing this game though, I realized that MegaMan games aren't meant for 3D. It just can't beat the original side scrolling MM games. Im really fond of the X series. I wouldn't mind seeing a MMX in 3D just as long as it has alot of the original concepts to it. Well...Thats enough from me =P Later! ^.^"
4,Good one.,"The product was good. It works like an actual microwave. My 2 1/2 year old daughter has set up her kitchen and this toy is a major involvement in her meal preparation routine. It was difficult for us to find a microwave toy in a store, but this was worth it."
2,Too short,"I'm not sure what this was designed to organize, but a sweater won't fit in between the shelves and not very well below unless you force it. You could put a folded t-shirt in each place, but not really more than one unless you force them. So I'm not really sure what the point is.It is made of plywood and the back and bottom of the sides is unfinished. I used this in my office for stacking papers, which it worked pretty well for. I've recently decided to get rid of it since it takes up more space than it saves for me."
4,"A good value, though obviously not as well-made as more-expensive pieces","I bought two of these to stack as a shoe rack and they work well for this purpose. The panels are not perfectly aligned but they're close and for the price, these are a great value."
1,This book is quite insulting to Mr. Wright,"When I first saw the book listing and read about the ""latest in pop-up engineering"" I had high hopes for this book. However, that hope quickly turns into disgust the minute I opened it. The book is poorly designed. The pop-up buildings are designed with some cheap software that fills trees with cheesy moire patterns, buildings with tastelss line arts and washed out colors. The binding of the book is so poor that it began to fall apart before I opened it. The paper engineering part is also mediocre. Most buildings don't actually pop-up. Instead it's just got some poorly die-cut panels that ""float"" in front of flatly printed images. With the recent dramatic improvement to pop-up books such as Harry Potter's Howart Carassel and the pop-up book of phobia, this book is mundane and boring. Publishing such a ill-conceived and executed book on Frank Lloyd Wright is an insult to our country's architectural history."
3,Large fine book,I think Dominic has panned the book needlessly. It is not that bad. It is a large book and yes the popups are not the best but they are not bad either. It is definitely a book to have in ones collection. Couple of the pops are large and deserving of attention.
2,Disappointing...,"I had high hopes for this books based on the high customer reviews and the publication date (2002)--which is in the date range of the modern high-tech paper engineered pop up books. I had seen some other architecture pop up books, and being an admirer of FLLW, I bought this one. Wow...what a disappointment. It's okay if you've never seen other pop up books before, and it's probably interesting to children, but I felt like it could have been so much better. The pop ups were simple, the old-fashioned kind. I didn't feel they did justice to FLLW's work at all. I would much rather have just seen good photos of the work."
3,Won't get a ticket,"Sort of lame, it works somewhat, but at least we won't get a ticket. They are not very adjustable, and a bit flimsy. But they stay on well."
5,Fascinating,"A great read about greed, politics, corruption, ineffective government, and of course, the heinous act of slavery. A must read now that the 150th anniversary of the Civil War is upon us. This would be a great movie!"
1,Initially great...,"This mouse pad is very smooth, and on the first few uses was a delight to use because of this - it tracked evenly and the mouse flowed over the surface lightly. However, after only a few uses, I began to have major problems because of the smooth surface - the light from the mouse would bounce back in odd directions, causing my pointer to jump around the screen. Returning to my old, course mouse pad corrected the issue."
4,Excellent Mouse-Pad,I bought this mouse-pad because it was the only plastic mouse-pad that wasn't a small circle pad or cost 50 dollars(how anyone can spend that much on a mouse-pad eludes me).However I have to say this is an excellent mouse-pad it sticks to my table perfectly without budging and it really does improving tracking.
2,Only works for a few minutes,"This mouse pad starts out great, but after a little use the mouse starts sticking to the pad and when I hold it up to the light I can see shiny areas on the mouse pad, also it seems to have scratched my new mouse feet too. Yes, I bought new mouse feet because I thought maybe it was the old mouse feet on my mouse, but now I'm confident this mouse pad had something to do with it. After a day or so of use, every time I go to make little movements with the mouse it sticks at first and I have to push to compensate, and then once the mouse unsticks from the pad it shoots off and I have to bring the mouse back, which basically makes fine movements impossible and frustrating.If you want a smooth glide mouse pad I wouldn't recommend this one."
4,Tourettes S/T CD,"Sydney metal band once described as a mixture of hardcore, nu-metal and other elements to create an apoplectic and eclectic noise. Also called Post Thrash/Groove/Industrial Metal. Female fronted band that is way heavy, aggressive and almost psychotic at times.Tracks:1. Once in a Lifetime2. Kill Em All3. Chair4. Allergic5. Cancer6. Face it7. Deep Hole8. Ped9. In Me10. Prayer"
5,DVD- Coffin Rock,"This is as true to life personal disaster as you can get. Although some movie enthusiasts tend to pan technical aspects of this movie it does portray very well the perils we all face in life when confronted with inexplicable problems. Infertility is the problem,a not understanding husband the angst,a woman who wants to be a mother the victim,and a psychotic interloper the terror. Chilling and scary story. This is an Australian movie that follows the usual Australian pattern of leaving the ending somewhat ambiguous but very realistic unlike USA happy ending movies. You won't forget this one soon."
4,Great Thriller,Coffin Rock is a great Thriller from the producer of Wolf Creek . Check it out !! Great acting and good story .
5,"Great show, great music: Fiorello! Original Bway Cast","It's wonderful. Lots of fun and joy. The perfect New York Broadway musical, it's a delight. I play it all the time."
2,A new York-centric non-hit,"This never rose to the level of a 'hit'. At this time (2006) it is datedtechnically and artisticly. It didn't win in '59, there is little hope that it will be remembered fondly in '06.In the end I bought it for archival purposes only and I'm being kind."
2,not as good,"this isn't what ul espect, the buttons on this controller and hard, you realy have to press them realy hard, and if your planing to get 2 of this controllers to play online DONT...when you have 2 controllers conected at the same time, they work good but when u turn on the headset it works ok, but when u turn 2 of them on, theres a problem the mics get cracy and it botters the other players and it keeps making noise....dont gett them i bought 2 of them i i compleatly regret getting them..."
2,Teether tablets,"This may work They are supposed to dissolve in water, but don't you have to smash them first andeven then it's hard to and they go flying"
1,Active Ingredient - Belladonna?,Is anyone concerned about the active ingredient - Belladonna? I've read that it is a toxin.
1,kind of sad.,"I am upset becuase i am trying to find the best natural safe remedy for my baby but i also want one that is EFFECTIVE. these pellets do not dissolve very easily, annd they did not work at all.. it was a pain to give it to him , and was EXACTLY LIKE I WAS GIVING HIM WATER! I think cold water would have worked better.. BUT I ran out of camilia teething relief (which seems to work better and does not have coffee or sugar in it) so i have melted 2 pellets in each ice cube and hopefulle will get better results since it will be on his gums while he sucks on it for a while.. hope it works and isnt just a waste of money.."
3,"Works great, takes forever to use","I really like this product. It seems to work better than most on my little guy's gums, but it takes FOREVER to use. Unlike most homeopathic products, it doesn't dissolve in his mouth. You have to dissolve it in water (or formula, or breast milk, or juice,) first. The directions tell you to dissolve it on a spoon with water. this can take up to 3 minutes to do and you end up loosing half the water (and I would imagine the medicine) in the feeding process. I generally end up putting it in his bottle and letting him get it that way. But it does work...well."
3,Okay so far,"These do not dissolve quickly at all! I have to put warm water in a teaspoon and drop 3 pellets in there, wait for 10 or 15 minutes and even then they wont be dissolved. I wont buy these again. They seemed to help him but with a crying baby who wants to wait that long! I like the hylands colic tablets, even for tummy pains and teething these work better."
2,Wasted time and money,"The Humphreys Teething Pellets are not super user friendly. It was a pain to dissolve the pellets in 1/2 tsp. of water (with an inpatient infant near by) and then trying to put it on my baby's gums wasn't really easy either because it was like rubbing water on them. I would have hoped for more of a pastey solution or at least something with substance. After ""applying"", there was no noticeable difference in my baby's pain. I should have listened to some of the other reviews. What a waste of money."
4,Very enjoyable,"This series of books is great. I enjoyed reading this one a few times. If you've got any love for drinking or brewing Belgian ales, this will get you mentally stimulated. I'd recommend buying a few classic Belgian beers to drink while you read it. Bliss!"
4,"Good information, that I haven't used yet","This book is for people that are into ""whole grain"" brewing. Not so much for ""extract"" brewing. I will be taking the leap into whole grain brewing in the future and this book looks like it will be very helpful in brewing one of my favorite styles of beer."
4,Fun read,This book is a really fun read for those who are interested in Trappist and non-Trappist Belgian brewing and marketing practices. It gives some good insight to how the different breweries brew and even gives some insight to how the ingredients differ. I would recommend this book for someone who is interested in brewing like a monk
5,A trip in belgian brewing world,Very interesting book for hombrewers because it teach the tricks used for many hundred years by belgian monks and brewers.
4,"Interesting reading, even for non- Belgian beer brewer","I'm a long way from trying to home brew Belgian beer, but I do like drinking it occasionally and learning about its history and variations (including American versions) and thinking about how I'd brew it. This book was ideal for those. Good discussions on basics like yeasts and sugars and the techniques used by the different Trappist brewers. Even some good photosIf I decide to attempt brewing it I'll need more step-by-step information, but I'll already understand the background and some important concepts. Perhaps more important, after reading it I'll appreciate more the ones I drink!"
1,NOT GREAT,"I DID NOT WEAR THIS COSTUME. I ENDED UP MAKING MY OWN, YOU COULD SEE RIGHT THROUGH THIS AND IT WAS WAY TOO SHORT.. DID NOT LIKE AND I COULD NOT RETURN.."
5,A new understanding of the concept of food.,"This book offers a new and complete understanding of soy, as an excellent example of the ultimate concept of food. Soy provides nutrients and phytochemicals. The phytochemicals of soy help to prevent the most common diseases, as heart attack and cancer."
4,Great but not 5*,"This is a very good drive, thanks to the Nero 5 software. Once I learned how to use it I never had a failure. However, the ""IN-CD"" program suggests that a CD-RW is a ""large floppy disk"" It is not. Use the Nero software to copy your files, not your windows explorer like I did. There is no such thing as a perfect CD burner... Yet. Always record music at 1x and with an image file(unless you have 3 EIDE ports on your MB) On-the-fly(CD to CD) is useless unless you can put the recorder on a separate EIDE port. I placed my CD-ROM and CD-RW on the secondary and my 2 HD's on the Primary because you cannot record your HD if it shares the same port as your CDRW. Twin dilima. But you can do a better job from an image file anyway(so is suggested by Nero 5). I recorded Geddy Lee's solo and it(seemed) to have as good highs and lows as the original(using image file)."
4,Don't count on ever seeing your rebate,A quick gripe about a great product. I purchased this drive in April and installed it myself in about 3 minutes. Not a single problem ever.It writes at up to 12X on even the cheapest blank CDs. A fantastic drive at a fantastic price. I'd give it a 5 out of 5 except that the rebate from Cendyne was supposed to arrive in 6-8 weeks- ha. Appparently the rebate is handled by a third party that is uninterested in customer satisfaction. They do not answer emails or phone calls. So keep that in mind - but it's still steal when it is on sale (7-27-2001 it's 50% off - WOW). ...
1,Cendyne - Don't trust it!,"I purchased the Cendyne drive and it will not work in any PC's for either reading CD's or buring. It reads incredibly slow and failed at 6 burn attempts across 2 PC's on it's own IDE channel.Before purchasing a Cendyne product, check out their web page and see the tech support bbs. Many, many unhappy users with complaints going unanswered."
5,Excellent Deal,A great drive that also happens to be a great bargain. Easy to install and use for this first-time CD burner. The Nero software is great. Drag and drop use that even I could not mess up. The drive is quiet and fast. I thought about paying more for a 16X drive and am glad I didn't. This one burns CD's in about 7 minutes. The two minutes you would save with a 16X drive is hardly worth the money.The drive came with a 4Mb Buffer instead of the 2Mb that was advertised. I cannot say enough good things about this drive. Buy it.
1,Cheep Junk,After a couple of uses this blower would not run. I put it aside and ended up buying a stihl for about twice as much money. Today I took this blower apart to find that the flywheel had sheared the key in the keyway. Next I found weed eater used a aluminum flywheel with a molded or casted in key. It is not replaceable and I will have to replace the whole flywheel. Why they use a aluminum key is the question and then to not make it replaceable? Sad. I will look into a new flywheel or maybe epoxy the flywheel on the shaft or just toss the whole mess in the garbage.
2,"Second one died, too","I believe in second chances, but this one didn't deserve it. Just like it's predecessor, the pull cord has seized and the machine is not worth the repair bill even though it's only about a year old."
2,You get what you pay for...,"And I didn't pay much, but that's no excuse for the workmanship in this product. After just 18 months on the job (and only using it weekly for the front walk and driveway), it ended up in the trash. The handle was never it's strong suit and finally broke free. But that was only the last straw. It's always been a little difficult to start and over the last few weeks has been running for a few minutes and dying. After restarting, it would run a minute or two and die. The fuel filter came loose in the fuel tank, but I couldn't replace without tearing apart the whole thing. Wasn't worth taking it in to get fixed. Rather went out and bought a new blower (different brand and not a 'cheapy')."
1,Pull Cord Seized After First Use,"Second time I tried to use this machine, the pull cord seized and would not retract. I had to disassemble the whole bottom unit, and rewind the metal wire, and reassemble the unit. The design in the inside is poor, I had to bend and fasten the metal wire in order for it to work properly. Pull start mechanism needs to be redesigned. I would expect this to happen to all of the units eventually."
1,Don't buy this item!,"I bought this because I have pine needles that cover my driveway on a weekly basis. It worked fine for the first 4 months. The pull cord got stuck and would not retrack itself. I called Amazon and they told me they only cover the first 2 months? So I had to call the manufacture. The manufacture is only open M-F. Once I contacted them, they recommended a place to take it to. This place kept it for 3 weeks! It worked fine for about a month or so then the same thing happend. So unless you want to keep calling the manufacture and taking it in every 2 months save your money use a broom."
4,Weed Eater FL1500LE 23 CC 150 MPH Gas Blower,"Ordered in February 2007 and am on the second tank of gas. Except for being a little [...] when starting initially, I have no complaint about its operation. In the 50+ years I've done my yard work and 20+ years using gas operated 2-cycle engines on many different devices, I only use 8-Oz of common 30-weight motor oil in a 1-gallon can of gas for them and have not had the frequent failures that other users have had with such devices -- I repaired small engines for the past 20+ years and know this from experience."
1,Perhaps the worst lawn and garden product I've ever owned,"This blower had bad starting problems from the beginning and they simply got worse over time. Once started it never seemed to warm up and run at full speed, and never produced much power. It was always sputtering and shutting off. Before long, various plastic parts began to deteriorate and fall off. I'd guess I got about 30-40 total hours of use over 5 years before I finally gave up and pitched it after the gas supply tube cracked in half and fell off one day."
2,Steer Clear-- Low quality product,"Cheap shouldn't necessarily mean low quality. If you're looking at this you probably want an inexpensive blower for a small yard, but don't want a power cord to lug around, and don't want to pay $300 for a backpack blower that is overkill. That's why I got this blower.Unfortunately, this unit is low quality. I used mine for 18 months and it's dead, the pull cord has completely seized and the handle has always been loose/cheap feeling. There is no fix given on the Poulan/Weedeater website for the pull cord, so I will either need to: 1. Take it to a shop and pay more than it's worth to repair it. 2. Open it up, lose parts, and not be able to put it back together 3. Take it back to Lowes and see if they will replace it, which I doubt, or 4. Buy something new. All actions you shouldn't have to take after very moderate use- 10 minutes a week in the summer and longer during leaf season.I think people will regret going low budget on this purchase."
1,Broken again,The second time I used this blower the pull cord mechanism failed. The cord would not retract. I dismanteled and rewound the pull cord. Next time I used it failed again. I am ver displeased with this unit and it is now unuseable. Can't start it without a pull cord. I do not recommend it.
1,I used it 3 times,"The third time, I ran it for about 5 minutes and shut it off. When I ripped the cord to start it a couple minutes later the handle broke."
2,Worn out before three years,"I have one of these that is not even three years old. I also had to fix the starter rope because my kids yanked it out. No big deal, that's the kids I figure. Now it won't start and its because the compression is low. This thing wasn't even used that much."
3,"Power OK, but could better, otherwise cheap, but OK for price","First of all, if can deal with an electric, get the TORO electric. Much better.This is OK. Pretty cheap quality, but for $69? It works ok, but there are better. Save your money buy an Echo or a Sthil.OK power, bordering on weak. Hard starting. Blows OK. Again there are much better out there, but this will do."
1,Piece of Junk,"I bought a Weed Eater Featherlite blower just like this at Lowe's. Lasted less than 2 years after moderate use. The handle attachment came loose. It was connected to the body of the blower by a very insubstantial rubber piece, so of course it failed. It was meant to fail, and to be sent to the landfill with the billions of other discarded pieces of junk that these cynical, greedy companies produce/import to foist off on us. I am old enough to remember when American companies took pride in the workmanship and durability of their products. Not any more. Now they take pride in how efficiently they can rip us off."
4,a classic in the field,"This is a good book for understanding the mathematics behind vibrations. The book initially contained basically everything known about the subject at the time it was written (1930s). Its only deficiency is its age. It does not cover modern developments such as the use of computers, numerical methods or FEM/FEA in vibration analysis. It also relates how the equations derived can be used for electromagnetic vibrations, providing nice insight into the power of the mathematics it discusses."
4,Very well written book,"I found Hartog's descriptions of vibrating bodies on moving bases very helpful in the class, and as a supplement to both the lectures and the assigned reading for the class out of ""Theory of Vibrations"" (Horrible book by the way), the class ended up being not that bad. Hartog though doesn't include many examples which made really understanding the concepts straight from his book a bit difficult."
3,more useful to engineers than laymen,This book is heavy into equations and offers little practical guidance. Familiariztion with greek alphabet is recommended.
1,Lifestyles of the Rich and Infamous,"Fergie's ""Glamorous"" is one of the worst singles around. It's Fergie's ode to her wealth, and that sometimes,like the common folk, she enjoys fast food. At least Madonna's ""Material Girl"" is a fun song,parodying pretentiousness.In this song, Fergie praises all her favorite things. And being marvelously rich. It's snottiness in song. To top it all off,she spells the word ""glamorous"" to help kids who haven't been hooked on phonics. There's a guest rap that REALLY DOESN'T HELP THE SONG ONE BIT. It's ludicrous..I mean,Ludacris.""Glamorous"" should be titled ""Pretentious."" Fergie should enjoy her wealth, kick back with Josh Duhamel, and spare Top 40 radio listeners. Retirement from music isn't always a bad thing!"
4,Great Figure for Jabba's Palace Alien Lovers,This is a great figure for Jabba's Palace Alien lovers. The only gripe i have is the fact that the weapon is made of a disappointingly soft plastic. You are almost afraid to break it trying to fit it in his claw. The body sculpt is very similar to the J'Quille body sculpt. ...
5,Always the charmer!,"This collection of essays from Frazier's work at the New Yorker is pure delight. First published in 1979, the material dances on the edge of ""dated"" without ever falling in. The content of his essays range from a trip to Oberlin, KS to an interview with rather eccentric Russian artists in New York. Frazier has a gift for making the mundane somehow sublime, a gift for picking up the previously unnoticed detail, turning it over in his hand, showing the facets to the reader. If you have enjoyed Frazier's work before, this selection will not disappoint."
2,Easy to backup; hard to restore,"Maybe impossible to restore. I bought this product and did a backup to my CD drive. Tried to restore several times, but the program cannot read the data it wrote. It does the backup quick and easy, but could not restore one single file."
2,Try the demo version first,"I bought this software and just cannot get it to run on my computer with Win2k. Althought the computer is very new and teh CDRW is supposed ot be compatible, the backups just don't work. Moreover, the software ruins the CD-RWs so that you cannot reformet them again.Tech support only tells you to buy better CDRWs and does not reply any more when you tell them that you use already the CDRWs they recommend.For me it was a big waste of money!"
5,They kissed in a shadow.....,"I love 'The King & I'! Deborah Kerr is great and Yul Brynner made the perfect King! I liked Rita Moreno as Tuptim. My school did a production of this musical just last month, and it was great too. Marni Nixon has an incredible voice, and I never realized until recently that Anna Leonowens and Eliza Doolittle's singing voices were identical. The original Soundtrack is definitely the best!"
3,"Mediorce Recording of ""The King and I""","This recording of The King and I is certainly not the best I've seen or heard. First off, only viewers who saw the movie would say ""What is 'My Lord and Master?' or 'Shall I Tell You What I Think of You?' or 'I Haved Dreamed?'"" The movie cut these songs and these in my opinion were actually the best songs on the CD. I WHISTLE A HAPPY TUNE and all the songs that Anna sings(except SHALL WE DANCE?) are horrible. Marni Nixon's voice was not made for HELLO YOUNG LOVERS, one that I've seen a 17 year-old do better. Yet, even though Rita Morneo's voice was dubbed, her and Rita gave the best performance. The high notes in MY LORD AND MASTER and WE KISS IN A SHADOW and I HAVE DREAMED were excellent. Lun Tha was very good and Terry Saunders as Lady Thiang was awesome. If you want to buy this CD it is really only good for being the movie recording and Rita Moreno and Terry Saunders."
5,"VERY GOOD WORK, but no MUSICAL NOTES","EXCELLENT WORK... However, we wanted to play this songs by ourselves, but there are no musical notes. That is the only missing part."
4,Musical and Memorable,"Love this CD, which is a replica of the movies' songs. Brings back memories and great to sing along with (in the car, of course). I love show tunes, so this fell right in line."
1,Where is the Mummy ?,"Jeff and Debbie are the two main characters. Thier trying to find a old mummy, but they get stuck in a blizzard. They end up stuck in the house. They find Anubis. Anubis is the god of death. He has been after everyone who has looked for the mummy in the story. You should read this book because a cool book and it's by Joan Lowery Nixon."
5,A Screaming Pleasure,If you haven't read The House on Hackman's Hill get to a bookstore and buy that book. I think every kid should read The House on Hackman's Hill. It's a mysterious book about two brave adventurous kids Jeff and Debbie who go on an adventure to find a mummy who everyone said disappeared but they think it's still there. Why'll looking for the mummy someone is trying to stop them. With a giant mansion and one mummy to find and someone or somthing looking for them it should be a bone chilling adventure. Get The House on Hackman's Hill by Joan Lowery Nixon. It will rattle your bones.
3,The Spooky House On The Hill,"This book is pretty good. The genre is mystery. It's about two cousins named Jeff and Debbie. They find a house on a hill then they thought they were being watched. They go to their neighborMr.Karsten that told them the story about his experience in the house when he was a kid. After they hear Mr. Karsten's story they go in the house. Find out what happens to Jeff and Debbie. You should read this book because it's a great mystery and at the end of every chapter it makes you want to read more.So get it, it's a good book."
5,Only I Know the Secret,"The House on Hackman's Hill is a fabulous book. When you start reading it you can't put it down. It's about two kids Jeff and Debbie. They're looking through an old haunted house looking for a mummy and ""Only I Know the Secret"". This is a must read book!"
4,The house on hackmans hill,"I think it is for people who like scary stories. At the end it is kind of boring but sort of bad. It ruins it by ending the story there..... It would be cool if you just make your own ending. Then read it you will find out your story at the end is better than the author's. The author did use all of his ideas in the other chapters, he should have changed it. ..."
4,The Best Book,I give this book a four because I didnt like the ending but I liked the rest of the book. I like how they left every chapter with a cliffhanger so you would want to read on. I recommend this book because I promise you will like it. You will like it because it is a mystery and a good book. Actually the best book ever! Also you will want to tell all your friends to read it and you would want to read it over and over. So that is why I recommened you read The House on Hackmans Hill. -Shocked Reader
4,Cursed!,"The House on Hackmans Hill is a great book. I would recommend this book to anyone! It's about two kids trying to find a lost mummy for a reward of $10,000. Thats a lot of money! A character in the story named Jeff is a smart adventurous kid who finds himself face to face with someone who I dare not say, Anubis. The Egyptian god of the dead. So pick up this book and start reading."
4,Only I Know The Secret,This book is a pure thriller!It will blow yourmind!It's about two characters Jeff and Debbie.They set on a adventure for a reward.They go to an old house with a mummy and a statue of an Eyptian god named Anubus.They find some creepy stuff.This is a great book and I recommend it to anyone.

Debbie and Jeff aren't scared they just want the reward.They find out that they aren't the only ones in the house. They don't know what there in for."
4,Only We Know the Secret,"The book The House on Hackman's Hill is a great book. It is about two kids named Jeff and Debbie, and how they see a haunted house and suddenly get interested in it. They then find out a rumor about the house and that theres a mummy in it and there is a reward for finding the mummy. They go on an adventure to get the mummy. While they're in the house they face very hard obstacles. Such as Anubis the Eygptian god of death. It is a bone chiller and it is the best book you'll ever read. You have to read the book to find out.booooooooooo!!!!!!!!!"
1,Garage Sale Special,"This past summer I found Joan Lowery Nixon's book The House on Hackman's Hill at a garage sale. In the fall I read the book to my son and daughter ages 9 and 12. My son could not stand the suspense. He would read chapters in advance and still enjoy rereading them with my daughter and me. What a fun, frightening book. We are still not sure who Anubis was. I was surprised to read it was no longer in print. My good luck was finding this book at a garage sale. I will keep it."
5,It was great,I read this book when I was in elementary school. I completely fell in love with it. I am now about to graduate college and want more than anything to find a copy of it to keep.
4,Best Book Ever,"I think the House on Hackmans Hill is a great book, for people who like cliffhangers at the end of each chapter. Also for people who like mysteries a lot.I liked this book because, it has two times in it. It had a lot of characters in this book, it also had a cliffhanger at the end of each chapter. I didn't like the end at all becauseit didn't end with a mystery. It ends with a happily ending story. By: Angel"
3,Courante from Three Lutes Dances,This CD has wonderful music but if you want these selections played on a live instrument be careful. There is no sheet music available for some of these. This is distressing because the happy couple in search of a perfect wedding are set up for disappointment when their musician cannot provide them with the piece they want.
4,A Nice Collection,"This album provides you with some good reference materials on planning the music for your wedding. Many of us sit around wondering what on earth ""Prelude to Te Deum"" is. Well, with this album you will wonder no more. This is a pretty good compilation of some wedding favorites set in order that they would appear in your ceremony (prelude, processional, ceremony and recessional). Even if you aren't planning a wedding, this album provides you with some really good classical music to relax by. At a good discount, this CD is a nice addition to any collection. I would recommend this disc."
3,ok,This was an OK CD. I would have purchased something different if I had planned things better but I simply ran out of time. It did the job that's what matters.
3,Very Helpful,"We were glad to find this CD so that we could review the music we wanted our ceremony musicians to play. It was very helpful.For the special reception songs we used the CD ""New Wedding Traditions Volume I"" It had ""A Song For My Daughter"" for my father bride dance ""A Song For My Son"" for the mother groom dance and other special wedding songs.Thanks Amazon for helping us with our wedding music.The Bride and Groom"
4,A Nice CD,"This is a very nice CD.Our daughter used some of the songs on this CDand some of the songs that are on the""Classical Wedding Traditions"" CD for the wedding.She also used many of the songs on the""New Wedding Traditions Volume I"" CDAmazon is a great place to find good wedding music"
2,No Index,"This book could have been great. The information is well written and well laid out.BUT:IT DOESNT HAVE AN INDEX! What was the author thinking when he wrote an ""Encyclopedia"" and didnt include an index????It also doesnt name the techniques, so imagine a class where you are discussing ""Technique number 37"" this does not lend itself to learning or teaching.Frustrating to read"
5,Great book!,"Volume 3 in a great series, this one focusing on takedowns and throws, attacks and escapes from the back, mount, north and south, and breaking the grip. History, intro, and rules for competition sections are continuations of what is in volumes 1 and 2. Plenty of black and white photos, as in the first three volumes, with 13 - 38 techniques in each section. Great techniques, in huge quantities, with many linked into ""if he resists"" chains. All gi, although many techniques can be used no-gi. Suggestions are similar to other volumes: explanations can be a little spartan, and no details on how to maintain positional control. Also, as a whole, the series does not cover escapes from submissions. On the whole, though, outstanding value given sheer quantity of great information, compared with BJJ VHS/DVD techniques/dollar."
5,A fantastic book in a great series,"This series is an essential addition to your Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu library, if you don't own it you should."
2,Shoot-and-see Targets,"The picture for this product is incorrect, what I received is a single large bullseye, rather than the 5 bullseye sighting in targets."
4,Good reference book,"I purchased this book. I have become interesed in gemsstones and this book gives a lot of information on the formation, origin, make up of Natural Gems. There is a excellent section regarding synthetics,lab created,and treatment of various gemstones."
5,gemmologia per curriculum al gem-a,"ho già la versione cartacea, ma la nuova versione per kindle mi permette di studiare (gem-a student) senza l'impiccio del libro. Un libro essenziale per chi studia gemmologia"
4,Wow,Very Interesting To Watch A lot of history and alot of vents that I had not heard of what a treat
3,Good but,"It was to much like a documentary, not a comedy. I would not watch this one again. Did not find this funny."
4,Love Jeff Dunham,"The Jeff Dunham parts were good, some of the other parts were the same old dummy talkingLove Walter and Peanut"
4,I'm no dummy,"I'm No DummyThis is very good to watch and I did enjoy it.I thought it would have more of Jeff in it,but was not extremely disappointed"
2,I'm No Dummy,While the tape itself is good we found it boring compared to others because it tells about all the past ventriloquits and the history of the art rather than being a show. It just wasn't what we expected but would probably be on interest to someone into studying the topic.
3,More a documentary than I was expecting,I am a HUGE fan of Jeff Dunham and was looking forward to the new release. There are small bits interspersed with interviews throughout. Would much prefer more of the acts.
5,Jeff Dunham,What can I say! He is one terrific ventriliquist and great commedian! I think we have all of his tapes.
1,Worthless,"You buy a Jeff Dunham tape to see Jeff Dunham, not have him interview a bunch of other ventriloquists! I want my money back!"
2,I was a dummy,"I did not like this at all. I was so disappointed. I am a huge Jeff Dunham fan and when I watched this to only find out he might appear in it 3 very short times, I really wanted to send it back! If I would have known that it wasn't one of his shows or that he wasn't gonna hardly be in it, I would not have bought it. I would recommend NOT buying this DVD. It's advertised as him being in it and he isn't really. Wait and rent it if your a fan. I would recommend any of his other DVD's for sure!"
1,Where's Jeff Dunham?,"I watched ""I'm No Dummy"" at the Seattle Film Festival and was expecting to see more Jeff Dunham and at least more stand up! Jeff is only in the film for a tiny bit! Not much stand up comedy and not much Jeff. I'm glad there's a documentary on ventriloquism but I was a bit disappointed."
3,Curb was subpar,"I received a copy that was low quality from Japan, not HD, not clear. Seemed like it was video taped from a camcorder or VHS. Also the 1st couple of episodes skipped. Seller told me he was going to send another copy and didn't. I am extremely disappointed in my purchase. It is new but made on the black market instead of those bought at Best buy or Costco."
5,Interesting historical theology,"A book by Thomas Hughes, a historian and theologian, about the masculinity of Jesus. It is an argument against the ""feminization"" and pacifist view of Jesus, in art and theology, and argues for a more masculine understanding of Jesus and his message.This may be of interest to the theologian, historian, student, pastor, group leader... especially in light of the recent ""Wild at Heart"" movement.An interesting old book. It gets lots of attention on my bookshelf - due to its age, it's unique binding, and the unusual topic. I'm still not sure what I think of it, but it provides an interesting perspective."
2,Adaquate,There are four movies in this series and I thought this was the one I liked the best. It isn't. I do thank the seller. The movie is okay but later I will order one of the other numbered Death Stalker movies. I just wish it could have been in DVD form too. VHS cartridges wear out faster than DVDs.
2,Boring,This movie is one hour and twenty-one minutes long and was released on January 1984. As for a plot there is none. A few breasts scenes and some sword action but that is it. The only thing that it has going for it is that it has stars Barbi Benton and Lana Clarkson. Rent it; don't buy it.
4,A diverse follow-up to their debut album.,"These guys have the most beautiful harmonies in country music. The only problem is...they don't use them to the full effect on this album. The songs are diverse and well-sung, but Ricochet can do better. ""He Left a Lot to Be Desired,"" ""Connected At the Heart,"" and ""What a Woman Can Do"" are probably the best efforts on the album, but ""You Still Got It' and ""Don't Forget to Feed the Jukebox"" are not that good at all. Overall,this album is a pretty good listen, but their first attempt was definitely better."
1,how fast can a speeding bullet???,I'll tell you how fast a speeding bullet can go. It's probably a little slower than the time takes for me to scream and hit the stop button on the cd player. I see lack of maturity and thought in this album. Here's a hint guys: Become unprettyfied and sing real stuff.
3,DTS 5.1 My A$$,"My review is based on the picture and sound quality, not the movie itself which I love. Scarface has been reviewed enough since its release and it is a great movie. That's why I am so dissapointed in this release of it twenty years later. If you own a 5.1 sound system like I do, you should wait for a blu-ray to come out cause this edition sounds really bad. The claim of DTS 5.1 is b.s. and even the Dolby Digital sounds bad. The picture quality is alot better and the music sounds alright. The extras are not anything great. Overall it's a mediocre release that is decent when played with a 2.0 system. It really deserves better considering how popular it is."
4,Dated but good storyline,"I watched this film on cable recently. I mistakenly thought it was a Martin Scorcese movie, so I looked it up on Amazon to see who the director was. It turned out to be Brian DePalma. Even though this movie is so old, the script was pretty strong. The photography was good, although it can't compare with today's films. I'm not really a fan of Pacino, but he was convincing in this movie as a Cuban immigrant. I did not like the Michelle Pfeiffer character, she was really shallow. There was alot of violence but compared to Scorcese's recent films such as ""Gangs of New York"" and ""The Departed"" it was not really shocking. Hollywood seems to be losing the ability to shock us with violence and language, they need to shock us with better written scripts and more in-depth character development."
5,An unfortunate association...,"This is a brilliant film, and it's great to see it finally getting the full dvd treatment.My only gripe is that, most unfortunately, the movie has been embraced by the denizens of so-called 'hip-hop culture' and crack-slinging gangstas. These clowns have stolen enough from popular culture, and it's really sad to see Universal pandering to them for a few extra bucks. Most of these 'gangstas' will meet the same end as Tony Montana, and they're not even smart enough to see the irony.Nonetheless, this is a masterwork for de Palma & Pacino; both times they've worked together (Carlito's Way being the other film) it's been pure magic. Is it too much to hope that they'll work together again? Buy this movie, ignore the street trash, and enjoy its wretched decadence."
1,DAMAGED,I HAD PROBLEMS THE DISC KEEPS COMING OUT OF MACHINE. HTIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. I ORDER ALOT OF PODUCTS AND RIGHT NOW I WILL BE REURNING THINGS AND I HOPE TO NOT HAVE ANY MORE PROBLEMS.
5,CLASSIC MOB,"THIS IS A CLASSIC MOB MOVIE, KIND OF BRUTAL BUT ENTERTAININGNOT FOR YOU IF YOU HAVE PROBLEM WITH THE VIOLENT SCENES,THEY ARE PLENTY OF THOSE."
5,My favorite movie!,"Scarface is a movie of its time. It depicts a violent era with unsurpassed realism, in an entertaining but shocking way. If you like your mafia movies with attitude, blood, story and more attitude like Goodfellas, you will love and hate Pacino in this one of his classic roles. Be warned, it is violent, and full of profanity (maybe a record amount). This is The Godfather of Disco Mafia at its best!"
3,"Universal, how could you?","First, this is the greatest film, known to man, al pacino's strongest role,and charactor, aside from carlito, in carlito's way, another film i'd recomend, anyways, this film, is amazing, the extras are great, but universal, did a horrible job with the picture quality, get the widescreen edition, on v.h.s. for the best picture, it's THX, this transfer is sorry,and it brings tears to my eyes, I got dvd, so I could see pacino, light the screen on fire,and this, sadly I can't recomend this version, because pacino needs to be seen, in a digitial transfer, this has alot of artifacts in the picture, be aware if you purchase, but I can't say it's horrible either, your decision, but this is the movie, to see it was the movie of the millenium, right alonside carlito's way, if you wan't to see some films, that will make you love, film,and life itself, these are it."
3,Scarface? Scarresolution,"I've had a lot of recent HD, Blu-ray version letdowns and this is certainly one of them, I won't review the movie because I assume any would be buyer is already a fan, but you should check this out since it does come with the old B&W classic original. Basically many of the scenes simply look BLURRY and out of focus, it's unavoidably noticeable and made me CRINGE in agony upon seeing such scenes in the movie. To me this is an overall letdown and I don't know if they can put out a better version... maybe it's just the nature of the source material that cannot be enhanced without also enhancing original problems with those certain camera shots?"
5,"""Say Hello To My Little Friend""","Fantastic movie. Fast paced and riveting, non-stop action packed which I am having trouble getting hold of in a VHS Australian format. Can anyone help?? (jlm@anzsec.com.au)"
3,NOT Pacino's Finest,"I guess that I am going to disagree with everyone else who reviewed the movie. This movie was NOT THAT GOOD. I guess that if I had seen this movie when it first came out, I might think of it as a ""classic"". Also, at that time, I wouldn't have been comparing it to Pacino's performances in Carlito's Way, Donnie Brasco and Scent Of A Woman. However, since I DID see how great Pacino could be in those other movies first, Scarface just seemed overly long, contrived and - in the end - just plain stupid.I know that I won't change any of your minds, but maybe someone who has read all of your rave reviews will read mine and think twice before plunking down the cash to see ""Pacino's greatest performance ever"". Get the other movies I mentioned first.I would be giving this movie 2 stars, but I DO really like Pacino's accent in this movie - so he gets another star.Jeremy"
5,THE WORLD IS YOURS,"SCARFACE IS BY FAR THE GREATEST ROLE THAT AL PACIN0 HAS EVER PLAYED. I RECOMMEND ANYONE WHO IS BIG FANS OF ""THE GODFATHER I,II,AND III"" AND ""DONNIE BRASCO"", ADD THIS ONE TO YOUR COLLECTION TOO. OR IF YOU DON'T WANT TO, THEN JUST ""FORGET ABOUD IT."""
5,the best ganster movie EVER,"dont listen to anyone who reviewed this, a few of them are idiots. if you liked gangster movies, this is THE gangster movie to own. if u dont like them, then buzz off, you shouldnt be here reading this review anyways. the only people who rated this movie low, are the people who dont like this genre. Al Pacino is great, as usual. This movie is a classic, and many other movies and t.v shows have used numerous quotes from this masterpiece."
3,in my opinion the most over rated movie of all time,"a while ago everyone told me this was such an amazing movie and that if i wanna become a director one day i should watch it and i watched it thinkn it would be amazing and i was let down, i mean great acting and stuff yea but its not much differnt then any other mobster movie and people over exaggurate that its great so much, in my opinion pulp fiction blows this out of the water"
3,Scarface- An epic that will never be forgotten,"Scarface- one of the most intense- yet compelling view of a selfish gangster/cocaine dealer. Al Pacino gives a standout performance and should have been at least nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, of which he was not. This movie will probably never be forgotten, especially the violent chainsaw scene and the famous phrase, ""SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND!""Orginally, Scarface was rated X (in that time that was the NC-17 rating) due to extreme violence and profanity. But, director Brian De Palma took the MPAA to court, and it finally got an R rating (thank god!) The reason why I am giving this movie three stars is because the story is depressing, but depressing in a way everyone can understand. Overall. it's a good movie, and I recommend it to mature viewers only."
2,Possibly the most overrated film of all time.,"You may or may not want to admit it, but if you've seen your share of movies, you'd know that ""Scarface"" really isn't that good. Sure, it's decent, but is it the greatest movie ever? No. Is it a great movie? No. Sure, it's decent. The original '32 ""Scarface"" was definitely great, and I might even add influencial. The '83 ""Scarface"" remake had to have it's writing dumbed down, and throw in unnecessary violence and drug content to appeal to the group of morons that wanted to see this."
1,Not socially redeeming; for those with too much time on their hands,"The 1932 version was better. Someone already noted the inconsistencies of this movie. This is as useless as Bruce Willis's ""Last Man Standing."""
1,Word.,"The movie is about this midget who likes to yell alot. He eventually marries a crank whore, and then since he's such a douche, he pisses this terminator wannabe off, and that guy blows him away."
2,Not Enough Cheese...,Although I found this movie rather enjoyable (What with the guns and stuff). It suffers through lack of cheese usage.TUT TUT!
