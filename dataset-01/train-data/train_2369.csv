3,Not my favorite,"This is the second Sesame Beginnings video we have purchased. We have Moving Together which I absolutely love. I don't like the dynamics of the host, Brandy and her daughter in this one and I don't think the songs are as good although they get stuck in my head quite a bit! Not our favorite. I would like to try some of the other ones."
1,rehash,"If you have her first book, save your money. This is a re-hash with a little extra thrown in, definetely not worth it."
4,Case broken.,"I received the sax I bought, but the case is cracked along the side. This does not make a good gift for my son on this 2nd of July.Not happy with the purchase."
2,Fun...I guess,"This game isn't a bad game, but it isn't nearly the same as NFSU 2 on the consoles or PC. They cut out quite a bit from the bigger screen versions, cutting this down to a rather bland, though solid, racing game, with the only interesting feature being tha tyou upgrade your car.If you are looking for a hand-held racing game, this one is decent, though there are better ones out there. If you are looking for a pocket sized Need for Speed Underground 2, don't bother, this shouldn't even share the name it is missing so much."
1,DO NOT BUY. YOU WILL WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! I REPEAT DO NOT BUY,do not buy this game. it is a total waste of money. i bought it yesterday and it sucks!!! if you want a good game do not buy this one. rather keep the money and buy a nintendo ds. one last time: DO NOT BUY!!!
3,Diamond-cut Chandelier Post Earrings,"The earrings are just beautiful. The offer a very dainty, delicate feel to them giving you just an equal a charm."
2,Record of Indeterminate Origin,"This is certainly a great video, but this is NOT an official one. This can be easily obtained through sharing groups and sites through the interet."
4,Nice!!!,The video and audio are not perfect but enough quality to appreciate the show. The live audio is charming compared to the highly maked up mixes.I'm happy to found it!
4,Female Christian Rocker,"I am not much of a female vocalist fan. But when I heard this cd, I became a Charity Von fan. She has a comparitvely deep as well as strong voice. I randomly receive several cd's a year. Only a few which have females to begin with. But only two have I liked. Plumb and Charity Von. She co-wrote most of the songs on this cd. And delivers a fabulous version of Collective Souls's ""Shine"". If you like the Pretenders, Pat Benatar, Joss Stone, or Sheryl Crow, you will like Charity Von."
1,Sleepy Tosca,"I have many recordings of Tosca, inevitably some are better than others but there is usually something in each one to make me want to hear it again. This recording offers nothing. The voices are passable but the real killer in this disc is the conducting. Michael Tillson Thomas(who I usually like) conducts as if he has just taken a sleeping pill is is trying to ward off the effects. Pacing is so slow you want to uger him on with a ""Speed it up!"". The pace picks up once in a while but the overall tone is lugubrious. Too bad as the disc is quite lengthy for highlights and could a been a welcome alternative to listening to a complete recording."
3,"Great for nails, but very messy","I tried this stuff as the reviews were very promising. The flavor is strong, it lasts, and the nutrients are excellent for your nails. I stopped using it after about a week, though, because it's very messy. The cream never really absorbs in like a lotion and I couldn't touch anything for at least 1/2 hour unless I wanted it covered in white dry paste. I would leave marks on my steering wheel, keyboard, mouse, clothes, desk, etc. It became so annoying I just gave up."
4,Works great!,"Thanks! The product leaves a bitter tastes, but works well. I don't bite my nails, but I clip and pick at them and this product helps heal the skin and cuticles."
3,Not as good as it was,"I've used this product for a while and it is great, certainly does its job and very well.(I now use it on the kids) My only niggle is that the consistency of it has changed. It used to be really nice to use, not the taste haha, but now it seems very sticky after applied. It is now more opaque than before so I don't know if they have changed something in it. I told the company and they thought I had a bad batch so sent me some more but it is the same. Their customer service is very good and I will still use it as it does beat anything out there."
4,Chewing nails for about 40 years! Hindsight (usually 20/20?),"For those frustrated parents out there with children that bite their nails? From one that has gnawed his nails down to painful levels (Not even the PAIN, stopped me!) The first thing I have recognized is that the individual MUST WANT TO STOP! That one psychological hurdle has stopped me for 40 years. Neither Mother nor wife has been able to dissuade me from my mission of nail biting.Once I decided for myself that it was time to quit, I got this treatment. It works nearly TOO GOOD!!! Only problem that I have now it that I have to make sure that I do not get this stuff on anything other than my nails. I had this on the finger side of my fingertips (opposite of nails...) and tried to eat popcorn and other finger foods. Only took about 3 bites to recognize I could not take the taste (maybe a new dietary tactic?)So in conclusion, this stuff REALLY WORKS! Just be careful to only get it on those items you DO NOT WANT Near any taste buds!!!"
1,Don't waste your money,"You have to constantly reapply this cream...and who wants that cream all over your fingers. It was messy and it didn't stop me from biting my nails. Save your money, buy the nail polish instead."
1,Didn't work at all!,"This product is expensive and doesn't work. It washes off really, really easily. it is also sticky. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. I have been a nailbiter for my whole life, 38 years, and this did not help me at all..I am very dissappointed and will now reorder the Mavala Stop which definately works while using it..!"
1,Control It,This product was very expensive and did not stop my 5 year old from biting his nails. I am very disappointed in this product.
1,Didn't work at all!,"Put it on my daughter's fingernails, telling her it was a healing cream instead of a solution to stop nail biting. This way we wouldn't have to struggle. She was very willing. Within ten minutes I saw her biting her nails. I said, ""doesn't the healing cream taste bad?"" and she said, ""No, not really... a little bit a first but then you get used to it really fast."" I continued putting it on for a week. Didn't make the slightest bit of difference!"
3,Tastes bad but not horrible,It definately makes me aware that I am biting my nails but I would prefer something stronger tasting to really deter me.
5,Omega 3 solution for nail biting,This stuff is awesome. It has such a bitter taste that I am starting to NOT bite my nails as much. Even when you wash your hands and try to bite your nails you still get a bitter taste. The only downfall is that you can't eat finger foods because it will taste bitter from the cream. Other then that I love this stuff and highly suggest that those with nail biting problems try it. It's all natural which is why I purchased it rather then the nail polish stuff that has toxins.
2,Ew.,"I never tasted this on my fingers, but I did taste it on my food. I don't know how I finally stopped this bad habit, but I know I gave up on this cream when I could no longer enjoy hamburgers because the taste made its way onto the burger. Yuck!"
1,Hard to Keep On,"I bought this for my 8-yr-old who started biting his nails. Unfortunately, every time he washed his hands the cream came off and would need to be re-applied. Since I am not with him during the day while he is at school, he can bite his nails all day! There was no hope of him re-applying on his own at school. I'm sending it back for a refund. I made another purchase of the nail polish-type product instead and hope that will work."
3,3 years old nail biting,"Taste is very bad. My son hasn't stop biting his nail, but is aware that if he put his finger in his mouth I will put the cream on his nails."
1,Did not work for us,"It did not work for our daughter who is 3 and bites her nails because the product makes her throw up. The taste itself is not as bad as it could be (you barely taste anything at first), but then it kind of coats your mouth and makes my daughter throw up instead of deterring the nail biting habit."
1,Disappointed,"After reading the reviews, I had high hopes for this. It's only plus is that it arrived earlier than expected. I got this product for myself (nail biting) and my 8 year old son who cannot stop sucking his thumb. It doesn't taste like anything at all to me, and doesn't seem to bother him much either. The Hoof nail polish stuff from Walmart tastes worse than this. (The nail polish stuff is too easy to pick off and remove.) I wouldn't recommend this product. Save your money, try something else..."
2,Not so Great,"I was optimistic after reading the mostly positive reviews, however I was highly disappointed. If you don't apply the product several times in heavy coats you don't taste anything and it needs to be reapplied frequently (at least daily). Also, while using the product it seemed that the taste would happen several seconds after going to bite my nails which made it rather ineffective as a control mechanism. And when eating or drinking anything if you just so happen to touch or lick anywhere near your nail it gives your food what seems to be a more bitter and effective bad taste compared to your nails themselves. I started to use a similar nail polish product but did not like the shine and how frequently it needed to be applied but it was much more effective and much cheaper as well. I suggest the nail polish over this product."
1,Apparently I'm Immune?,"I've been biting my nails for nearly 20 years and I've tried everything to stop. From the nail paints, to filing them so low you'd think I couldn't bite them, to soaking my fingers in cayenne pepper solution. Nothing worked. I was really excited when I saw this online and it had so many high reviews. It had worked for so many people, but it didn't work for me.I can't taste the stuff. I thought that I had not put enough on, but I ended up just putting a good amount on my finger and then deliberately licking it off, and it didn't taste like anything for me. So it was really expensive and doesn't work, I'm quite disappointed. I tried all three containers (which are much MUCH smaller than I expected) thinking one might have been defective, but none of them tasted like anything.I guess just use caution since it's a good hunk of money and I noticed other people couldn't taste it either."
3,It's OK,"These jars are tiny, slightly bigger than a quarter in diameter, but they do last more than a week if you want it to - The taste is bitter, but I kinda got used to it and unfortunately it doesn't bother me that much anymore."
3,WEAK,this is a 666 remix so that is the only reason it's good.ville valvo's voice is way to high-pitched here!all i could hear was noise!him at it's worst!
5,"Finally, some depth to evil...","This book does a very good job of delving into the motives, methods, and manners of the darkest beings in the World of Darkness: Infernalists. Covering the gamut from adherents to dark pagan gods to satan-worshippers to bane-possessed fomori to nephandi, this isn't really a Mage-specific book, or even a Renaissance-specific book. Instead, it is a good general guide to servants of darkness and corruption, useful for games set in any era using any of the supernatural races.What /is/ Mage oriented in here is very good. Light on mechanics, heavy on paradigm and subjective perspectives. It gives a look into Nephandic seekings, infernal faith, dark tass, and qlippothic spheres."
3,i love this doll but it has serious scratch on the face,"I am not sure it was from which seller, but was quite upset experience, the doll has two big scratch, I tried to contact the seller, but seems he/she just responsed once but no follow-up any more. I am currently out of the country, so it is impossible to return. I think mattell provides really poor quality on this gold label."
2,Shocking!!,"I found this book to be very distubing. Shocking. NOT for the weak of heart. I live around the Amish and not in my wildest dreams would i have imagined such perversions! And to think that this man admitted to doing all these things!! I sure would like to know the ""rest of the story""."
3,Amish Confidential: The Bishop's Son Shatters the Silence,"Well written details. Easy to imagine the settings. Hope there will be a sequal so we know how the author overcame all the stigma, feeings of confusion and discontent he felt which led to his decision to run away from the community."
1,Grossed out and disturbed!,"I can't believe that this guy is a good representative of the Amish people. Rather, it seemed to be an odd account of child abuse mixed in with sex with animals. Bizarre, disturbing, and something that's better left alone."
1,Don't waste your time,"The book was poorly written and repeatedly informed the reader of ""doing it"" with farm animals and beatings by his father. More details about daily life beyond sneaking out, getting drunk, and brawling would have been more interesting."
3,Everlast Neoprene Shorts,"I bought these (3) Items for My husban and my son, 2 XL 1L. But they are both do not like it, because too sort.. It did not pull up to hips, and when he sit or walk it's slipping down. Trere for I return it back 2"
2,Product to small,"I purchased this product, it was not fitted for size. Eventhough it was an extra large product, it's actual fit was much smaller."
4,pretty good,i liked it. im a big fan of this series and this one was great. can't wait 4 the stowaway solution
4,Kids on the Run to Free their Parents!,"Gordon Korman's series of Aiden and Meg Falconer who are on the run from the law and foster care when their parents are in prison. Aiden and Meg believe that Frank Lindenauer is the only man who can exonerate their parents and free them from prison. The FBI is hunting the kids down. In this part of the series, Aiden and Meg are in California.It's an easy book to read although the running around of two young kids is a little unreal at times. The parents aren't that solid or developed enough even with Meg and Aiden's recollection of freeing their parents. I wonder more about what the crime sent them away in the first place.This book is fine for kids and for easy reading."
5,"A must for every ""Bankie"".","Meg Henderson has given a wonderful insight into what happened in Clydebank during and after the Blitz. Anyone associated with Clydebank in any way will relate to it. A wonderful story, keep the tissues nearby."
5,"I have used everything, and this is hands down the best on the market!",LOVE.It is NOT for removing eye makeup. It is for oily adult acne prone skin only. I have old skin but sill have acne. This was the ONLY thing that worked!
5,Great for the skin...,"I love this face wash and it's affordable. I'm not one to be cheap with beauty products, but found that this product works great. It's gentle yet cleans well. I've been using it for over 5 years now and am sticking with it. In fact, I think it's great that my husband uses it too and I don't need to buy any face wash specifically made for men."
5,The ONLY face wash for me!,"I'm in love with this stuff!I spent years trying to find a face wash that worked for me, as literally everything else has broken my skin out in pimples.This gentle wash works wonders, I finally found it at age 16 (I'm now 24) and I've been using it every night (sometimes only every 2 nights) and its kept my complexion clear. On the rare occasion I've run out of it, I break out with in 3 or 4 days, I try my best to make sure I'm never with out now!A trick I've found to really help it work (though not necessary) is to pump out two or three pumps, rub it all over your face in small circles, and then relax and allow it to sit on your skin while counting to 60-90 seconds, then rinsing well. Washing my face that way removes even my super-tough 24 hour foundation and water proof mascara. I cant recommend this product enough!"
2,Made my entire face breakout,"I bought this face wash (and the little lotion too) because I love Aveeno body lotion. I've always had clear skin, but after a few months of using this, I started getting little zits all over my face. My entire forehead was bumpy and oily; I've never seen so much acne on my face. I switched back to my old face wash and they went away after a few days. It is pretty good for removing makeup, so I'll probably just use it every now and then for that. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone for daily use though"
1,Terrible. I hate this product with a passion.,"I bought this product because aveeno has some pretty awesome stuff. The first couple of days using this product I really loved it. The texture was nice and it did a good job cleansing my skin, but within two days my face had a terrible reaction. My whole face was red, itchy, and full of burning hives. I'm still recovering and it's really painful and itchy. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I've read about 5 other reviews of people having the same reaction! I wouldn't risk it if I were you!"
1,Doesn't work on EU consoles,"Doesn't work on EU consoles, Doesn't work on EU consoles, Doesn't work on EU consoles, I'm stuck with a sexy game in a box."
4,"Good, Dirty, Fun.",Nobody buys this game for the volleyball (though it is quite fun) this game is fun for anybody who just simply wants to admire and take in the 3D art (yes art) of the DOA ladies and the beautiful environments they are put into. While the game can get old fairly quickly due to its multiple team combos and expansive mini games it's sure to satisfy the fan in everyone.
2,Don't buy it. Achievements are hard and gameplay is awful,"I have only sold two games in my lifetime because they were so bad. Guitar Hero World Tour and this game. This game however is probably the worst I have ever played. I mean at least world tour I got 20+ hours with and got half of the achievements but this one..I put 10-15 hours in and got nothing out of it.The achievements in this game are quite difficult and they require hours and hours of dedication and time.I got this game assuming it would be like Rumble Roses XX. Fun, good replay value, and grab some achievements along the way. Granted Rumble Roses achievements are hard too and require an ample amount of time to get but its no where close to this game. The only good thing about this game is that because it was so bad it was fun to show friends how bad it was and make them go down the terribly long and hard water slide."
2,Alittle of the same game.,"DoaX2 was just like Doax except somewhat harder. You competitors are harder, the suits are more expensive and the graphics are better. It's basically the same game, with more mini games included, that's all."
2,Just a little upgrade from the first,"This game is the same like the first one for xbox. The only new thing is just jet raceing the rest are the same, they could had done more then just put partial nudity cause this game got boaring quick. When i first heard this game was comeing out i thought their was going to be more fun and exitment but when i played it i thought i was playing the first cause their was nothing really different exept jet raceing and some new music witch i did'nt really care for. The jet raceing was a little fun it was'nt that great but the rest was just the same. The same stuff include vollyball, pool hopskotch, relaxing near the water, buying new clothe's and figer and nail polish, and that's it they just added jet raceing. So this game was no good they should had done more in this game."
2,DOA - Junk,"Okay, I picked this game up because the first one was so much fun and the graphics were awesome. This one however was a let down. They changed the game play of the volleyball so much that I don't enjoy playing that part of the game. They did however add jet skies and that takes up all my time on this game. They tried to do too much and changed what wasn't broken. Overall it's a let down."
2,Just doesn't work,"Don't bother. The best part of the game is the intro movie that leads up to the title screen. It goes all downhill from there. The controls of just about every game just don't really work all that well. Trying to get these girls to be your friends is just not worth the aggrevation as they always get mad and leave you for seemingly unknown reasons. And then you need to have friends to play volleyball, so you end up stuck just lapping around a lake in a jet ski.I will be honest in that I only gave this game about an hour of playtime. If there is more to unlock if you stick through the annoyances, I don't know... it isn't all that clear. But I can't see anyone actually giving this game the time to really progress in the game."
2,don't be mislead......,"Missed potential is the word here....awesome graphics, and hardly any fun... a bad combination...the worst part is the fact that this could have been a great, no, FANTASTIC game.... so frustrating to see that happen..still, it's got merit.... pick it up cheap if you can"
1,"Very poor game, I expected more but received less.","I loved Dead or Alive for the regular Xbox. However, this game is just a piece of garbage. First of all, this might not be a big deal to most people, but if you love to earn achievements, YOU WILL hate the achievements for this game. I cannot begin to explain how hard this game is. Yes it is fun to watch these beautiful characters dance around but there is NO nudity in this game. I was very sad with my purchase because personnaly, I thought this game had nudity. But there is none. There are no instructions for when you start the game, possibly your only option is to research the game online and watch youtube videos how people play the certain types of games in DOAX2. I have to tell you all, the racing games this DOAX2 has to offer are very challenging. You will waste your money if you purchase this product."
3,"I collect games, but I'm not sure if this was worth it.",I love the dead or alive series and I found it to be fairly challenging. This game however wasn't as good as the dead or alive games even though it is one. I reccomend this only to people who are kinda pervy and like watching the girls of dead or alive play ridiculous games half naked... Butt battle... I want some fist battles.
3,"Edit: I made it fit, but. . . .","I initially rated this 3 stars because I couldn't make it fit on my bike with the parts supplied. I bought a 2.00 clamp from my LBS and now it fits just fine. However, the way the adjustable clamp is supplied on the left side of the rack interferes with panniers. So I had to reverse it, which then causes interference with the disc brake cable. So for me it required a certain amount of engineering to fit. Partly issues with my bike lacking a right side eyelet, and partly the bad placement of the left side adjustable arm thing. It should include mounting instructions because there is a definite order of operations in getting it to fit.Mounting issues aside, the rack is well built and sturdy, and I'm glad that I chose it, overall. I would probably up my rating to a 4 if I could."
4,Works well but could be better.,"The Journey Disk rack is made not to interfere with the rear disk brake assembly. It works quite nicely, but it could be improved by having the factory make the adjustable support rod 20 mmm longer. This would make it possible to have it attach to the mounting hole on the frame instead of the disk brake tab."
1,ABSOLUTLY AWFUL!!,"Welded rack construction is sturdy & well made however-does not mount correctly to ANY disc bike frame!First of all, the so called ""adjustable strut"" that supposedlyMounts to the disc brake tab requires a longer bolt (not included),The strut arm is pre-bent incorrectly to fit most frames becausethere are other mounting bolts for other components in that same area.This rack is well constructed however, the stationary arm welded into the rack,is TOO SHORT to reach most frames on the right side of the bike.The soft flat black powder coating (?) is not durable enough to survivethe hours of fidgeting in a failed attempt to get this thing to work!The ONLY disc brake rack that will successfully attach to the bike id the Delta Disc Rack, and that isn't saying much in the way of a disc rack because it is ALSO flimsily!Although Axiom rack price is very reasonable, it too is a gamble, because chances arethis rack won't fit MANY bikes!"
3,The book stayed with the title,As rated it was okay. I have read all of Joy Fielding's novels and it appears with Trance she has changed her genre a bit.
3,omron hj-720itc pocket ped.,"I am happy with the ped. except it doesn't count stairs and I do a lot of stairs. I work at Mt. Rushmore and try to walk the trail everyday but with all of the steps you do not get a correct count of time for arobics. Even though, you are moving continusly the ped. stops counting."
4,Dr. Recommended,"Easy to use, unit download to PC via software included and works with vista. Small and works in pants/shorts pocket, so no one knows you are keeping track."
4,Works pretty well,"My wife wanted a pedometer that could track steps be downloaded for analysis. This seemed to fit the bill. The software is fine, and it works. My wife is not too happy with the holster that comes with it. The clip is very weak. It's designed for belts and jeans, I think. Yoga pants, stretch pants, shorts...it doesn't hold very well."
3,"3 Years, Still Works Gret - Eats Batteries!","I don't want to overburden anyone here with a lengthy review. All you really need to know for this to pay off is that 1) you don't have a defective unit, and 2) what a pedometer is used for.You also need to know that this think goes through a battery in roughly 3 weeks time whether it is being used actively or not. It is cool to link it with the software, but there are others that do this just as well without making you go broke buying batteries (Coin Cell CR2032)"
4,Omron G Walking Pedometer,"This pedometer is one of the easiest units to use that I have ever had. The readout is clear and bright and once you set the units information it is no longer necessary to make additional settings. Each morning it is reset and ready for use with all the previous days readings available for display at the push of a button. The safety cord attached to the unit keeps the pedometer safe from loss and from falling to the ground or elsewhere. Without question, one of the best pedometers, regardless of price, I have ever owned.Omron HJ-720ITC Pocket Pedometer with Advanced Omron Health Management Software"
5,Not your run-of-the-mill junk pedometer,I'm really pleased with how well this pedometer functions. It's easy to use and seems pretty accurate which is more than I can say for other pedometers I've used. I like the fact that you can download the information to the computer and track your activity. It certainly has made me more conscious about how many steps I take. I've started trying to add steps where ever I go!
4,Bad Belt Clip,Unit is outstanding and accurate. Major defect is belt clip that doesn't stay secured (clip is too small and doesn't catch bottom of belt). Lanyard is only saving grace. The unit I had a couple of years ago was lost because it wouldn't stay on my belt.
5,A Worthy Investment,"I have tried other pedometers in the past and usually wiped out the memory by bumping into things. I decided to give this one a try especially since I am a tech junkie. I have loaded the software onto my laptop and can't get over how easy it is to track progress. The pedometer resets itself at 12am each night so no way to accidentally erase the memory. It also tracks when you are taking your steps. Sure enough, it very accurately accounted for my AM treadmill time. You can also set goals. Don't worry, you don't have to load the information in each day. It can be done every couple days which is a plus. Another good feature is the sturdy belt clip. I don't have to worry about knocking it off. I love it...I wish I needed two! The price is also reasonable compared to cheaper models. Happy stepping!"
5,Awesome Pedometer,This is an awesome little pedometer. I had been buying (and breaking pedometers every 2-3 weeks for the past six months. I was buying the little cheep ones from the local store. When I decided to buy this one I was nervous about spending the money. It works great! I have now had it over 2 months and it has not broken and continues to work great. I love the computer program too. This pedometer has already paid for itself in my book! I also find it to be very accurate in my pocket when it is not clipped on....That's an extra bonus. I give it a full 5 stars!
4,Keep track of your day,"If your doing a lot of walking and you want to keep track, this is a great pedometer, i slip it in my change pocket in my jeans and check it at the end of the day. it's not to big and pretty accurate. I did a lot of research and even talked with several of the people who make somewhat competing products (Fitbit, gowearfit,bodybugg, polar pedometer watch) and they all say that this is the most accurate of the cheaper.It does hook up to the computer and can use the software which is ok, i give it 4 stars mainly because it could be a bit smaller. and it's mainly for walking. For those who like the have the latest and greatest i would highly recommend the Fitbit."
4,Pedestrian activity recording,"I purchased this item to clock my activity (or lack of) at work. A sedentary job that I need a reminder to get up and move around the office every so often. I set the alarm on my calendar and at mid day and end of day I check my pedometer. I try for 3 - 4 thousand steps per day. This unit is excellent for keeping daily information and each Saturday I download it to the PC with the software that came with the unit. I do not expect to use the aerobic feature, but I felt that the capability to distinguish between riding in a car, walking, and jogging was pretty good technology."
3,"alright, so far...","so i've only use this for 7 days now, but i've already noticed a problem. i usually walk approximately the same route which is about 2.5 miles, & i usually walk this lap twice. today i walked this route once, plus 6 times around a 1 mile track, & it registered 5.97 miles. i'm no math whiz & maybe i'm missing something, but i'm pretty sure that's at least 8 miles. on the plus side though, i'm really impressed with the Omron Health Management computer program it came with so far. also, it measures several different things so that's nice, considering the freebies i've aquired over the years measured steps alone. as the description says, it measures steps, aerobic steps, calories, distance, time, & fat burned. my findings this early on, if you don't expect perfection this is worth it just for the monitoring program."
5,The Best Pedometer EVER!,"Actually I was looking for a bodybugg when I spotted this pedometer and I must say, its MARVELOUS. It tracks my total daily steps, my daily aerobic steps (love this), total aerobic time, calories and distance. All info seem very accurate. I measured with a GPS system. The companion software is GREAT. I just download my data (using an USB cable) and like magic it creates charts and makes the calculations to show my average over time (weekly, monthly, yearly) and the current day. I've been using mine for a month now and I love it. I can event print out my data before heading to my doctor (we are monitoring my progress - trying to lose weight naturally). So far so good - it works, it keeps me motivated and I feel in control over my destiny. Wow such a powerful device for its size. You won't be disappointed with the pedometer or its software."
4,Omron HJ-720ITC Pocket Pedometer with Advanced Omron Health Management Software,"Great Product. I where it every day, helps me track my activity for the day. The only thing I don't like is that it falls off my waistband on my pants, pretty easy and doesn't seem to be accurate if the item is not vertical i.e. sideways in a pocket. I like the software, but haven't played around with it much."
4,"Great little gizmo, but...","I've had this in my pocket every day since I got it over a month ago, and I love it. I think, however, it could have a couple more features for the money that would make it even better. It's really nothing I can't do with a little math on my own, but it would be nice if it was built in to the pedometer.I would like to see it give the total time spent walking in a day, not just the time spent walking aerobic steps. I think it would make it easier to know how much more time one would need to dedicate to getting to one's target step count.I'd also like to know the average mph I am walking. Because it gives the total amount of miles walked in a day, and then only the time walked in aerobic steps, it is really difficult to know how fast you are walking. Thus, it is hard to know how accurate the calorie counter is.Other than that, it is a neat little device. I found it very easy to set up initially, and I like the 7 day memory feature."
2,"Fantastic Idea, But . . .","On March 23rd, I received this little gem with the 30-day warranty and immediately programmed it into my computer. For a month, it gently prodded me into walking a bit more, smiling when I reached goals and frowning when I failed. Tracking progress online was a joy -- and a great incentive to try to exceed previous activity. On April 26th, I looked forward to uploading data from an extra-good day only to see a ""0"" in the window. I didn't even try to connect it to the computer, but wore it for the two following days. Still zeros. Having heard the little pendulum sound in the unit, tonight I decided to see if it recorded steps anyway and found that it showed lots of data -- incorrectly. Active days showed few steps, while a relatively sedentary day had unaccountably high numbers that didn't tally right, hour-by-hour. I have not dropped or otherwise damaged it, so can see no reason for it to suddenly malfunction. This is an excellent idea that should be a lot more durable."
2,omron hj-720ITC problem,"This pedometer was very accurate and worked fine until I attempted to download info to my computer. It would not download to the Omron software.I contacted Omron customer support and was told to send it in for replacement. I am awaiting the return of the new unit.Also, my wife has the non-downloadable version of this pedometer. It has a reset button on the front that allows you to check mileage on a walk by setting back to zero which this unit doesn't allow. It is slightly smaller and less expensive."
2,Waste of money,"I bought this product hoping to get a better idea of how much walking I was actually doing. What I got was a stupid instruction manual that doesn't mention how to manually turn it off short of unscrewing the back with a tiny screwdriver(included) and then putting it back in and screwing the back on. Because of these complications the battery didn't last very long and I didn't have the patience to keep removing the battery. When you purchase this product it mentions this ""slight"" difficulty but again no mention of how to overcome it."
2,Compatability Issues,"I enjoyed the pedometer until I acquired a new laptop with Windows 7. The software no longer recognizes the pedometer or blood pressure device. I also discovered that the Access database used by the software is password protected and can only be accessed from the software. If direct access to the data is important, you'll have to process it via CSV files. After several tries over several months to get things working, I'm looking for an alternative device."
5,"Love it, but missing battery.","This is my fourth Omron pedometer. My first was a gift for my husband from my mom. It was the simpler model, that does not sync to the computer. It came without a battery, but since I didn't order it, I didn't complain.My husband loved his so much, I bought one for me. It had a battery. My husband's accidentally went for a swim, and is probably in a water treatment plant now. So, we ordered another for him. Came with battery.Last, I wanted to update mine to the computer sync type. This one came without a battery, but I love it. It stores weeks' worth of info, and when downloaded into the computer, it not only tells you your daily totals, but also your averages, and monthly totals."
1,Not that happy,"This item never shuts off! I actually purchased two from the same company, just different models and neither one shuts off. It says that after 5 minutes of non-use it will automatically shut off...it NEVER HAS. I'm not happy with that because the battery ran out. Now, neither of us are using the ones I purchased. I don't recommend it."
3,Good... but not perfect.,"Really enjoy the software used with this unit. However.. there should be two separate settings for walking / running stride. Also, wish there was a timer to activate on the unit itself to time my runs and view on the unit itself. All you can really do is look at the clock and time it that way.One last thing... my unit never turns off! It states in the manual it is supposed to turn off if left alone for 5 minutes. I can't wait to see how often I'm gonna have to replace my battery!Any suggestions anyone?!"
2,I've Found Better,"I was really excited to try this pedometer, but once I tried to load the software, nothing happened. I tried the special instructions for when auto install does not run and still nothing. The CD was accidently sent blank. I tried to download the software off the OMRON website, but that file errors in the middle of download. Customer service has not been very helpful thus far. In addition, this pedometer is so sensitive that it will not calculate steps that I make without shoes on. For someone who likes to take their shoes off when I get home, it does not lead to an acccurate step count for the day. Just about the only thing that's great about this pedometer is that it stores your information for 7 consecutive days and it has a great clip to stop it from falling. Other than that it hasn't been the greatest experience. Sometimes cheaper is better. I miss my little one from Target."
1,NO MAC SOFTWARE!,"I just received my HJ-720IT. Looks great and may very well deserve the high stars others give it, but I may return it. THERE IS NO SOFTWARE FOR MAC COMPUTERS. Amazon's description must be absolutely clear on this: saying there is PC software implies all Personal Computers. By the way, the model I've received (HJ-720ITFFP) isn't actually listed at the Omron website - apparently it is just the same as the HJ-720ITC and differs in its being packaged differently. The operator at their Customer Support line said they may be working on Mac software."
2,I have yet to meet the ideal pedometer,"It's probably just me, but every pedometer I have tried has failed me in some way. This one was so highly rated that I thought I had finally met ""the one."" However, like all the cheap and free ones I've had in the past, this pedometer also disappointed. Things went well for our first few dates, but on our fourth day together I accidently knocked it, and it fell off my belt loop. The blasted thing lost not only my steps for the day, but all the programmed info, and it's no easy task setting the thing. So I packed it back up, and now it occupies space on my desk. I plan to donate it to Goodwill.Maybe a less clumsy and technologically challenged person will have better luck."
2,Very disppointed,"At first I was delighted. As advertised the Omron not only calculated the walking actvity on the unit,the software gave you the abilty to see on my PC a graph of my daily,weekly and total progress. After 2 weeks however, the Data download would not function. Despite several attempts to fix and uninstall,the data would download to 50% and then an error message would occur without explanation.I will be sending the unit back to Omron and hope that their customer service is better than their product has shown to be. I am keeping a manual log, but that is not what I envisioned when I ordered what I thought was a reliable product. Disapponted!"
2,Okay pedometer,"I landed up returning it...it was not accurate in my experience. It was sporadic during my walks. As someone who just had a baby and needs to fit into a postpregnancy bridesmaid dress soon, I'd rather find one more accurate and dependable."
2,Very disapointed with this pedometer,"There are two things I really like about this product. The software works great and it is nice to be able to track your progress. I love the resetting itself at midnight.There are many things I do not like about it. It seems to ""stall"". It will not record steps and then suddenly takes a jump and adds lots at one time. You cannot track your excercise on a stationary bicycle no matter where you place it. If you are on your riding lawnmower, it adds steps like crazy.The size is too bulky. It is very awkward to wear. I wish I had not given my other pedometers away. They were much less expensive and I liked them better."
1,No Software,"This item did not come with the software. It looks new, but I have purchased 3 of the HJ-720 models with different letters and this one didn't have the protective plastic on the face. I have a feeling that this is a factory refurbished model. I have only used it for 2 days, so I can't attest to how long it will last."
2,NO MAC SOFTWARE = NO SALE!,"I did not look past the Windoze(tm) only tab.Too bad, it looked good up to that point!"
2,Ok. But bad size and belt clip,I already know I will lose this pedometer one day. It constantly falls off my belt. I have tried clipping it on my belt but the clip only goes down half way. I have tried clipping it on the loop. Either way it comes off whenever I sit down or get out of a car.It is too big to wear around your neck too.If they could fix this the rest of the features of this device are awsome
4,Great Product,I purchased this product for a survey being conducted at my job and I love how easy it is capture my results. Plug it in and upload. I love it!
2,Missed Steps,"I had been using a cheap pedometer for a while and bought this one because I liked the uploadable tracking functions. The first couple of times I wore it, I periodically tested to see whether it was counting my steps correctly because my step count seemed really low and found out that it was missing a LOT of steps! It didn't count any steps when I went up or down stairs, and no matter where I clipped the thing, it counted steps inaccurately. I switched back to my $5 pedometer which never fails to count correctly."
5,Worth the money!,"I bought this item even though there were others that cost less available, because I was intrigued with the computer application (it will download your personal information onto your computer).I haven't used that feature yet, but I can tell you that this is clearly a really high-quality device that even got me to do more walking - I hate leaving it at home!"
1,Pedometer,THis product does not shut off and I have had to remove the battery and now I am not using since each day I would have to put the battery back in (which entails removing a tiny phillips type screw) and I don't want to do that every day.
1,Might be a great pedometer if you don't lose it due to poor clip design,"I am extremely disappointed with the Omron company. The clip that comes with this pedometer is of extremely poor design. It falls off of your waist band. The second day of use, I lost it. It was a busy day and I have no idea where it fell off. I contacted the company requesting a new one be sent or at least some sort of credit towards another one, explaining what had happened. Well, if you can't return the product they will do nothing for you. Of course it is impossible to return an item that has been lost due to poor design. I have no idea how good the product is. If you buy it, do not clip it to your clothing. Put it in your pocket and make sure it will not come out otherwise you too will be out $30."
2,Belt clip sucks,Took me about a week before I lost the pedometer. If I ever find it again I'll stick it in m pocket rather than use the belt clip.
1,Omron Pedometer a NO BUY!,The only pro thought concerning this pedometer is that it does accurately measure your steps.BUT:1. Clasp is terrible. I am currently looking for this device as it fell off of my belt. I have had this device come loose from my belt and fall at least 10 times and I haven't owned it a month yet.2. Software is limited. Just good for downloads. Limited info.3. Thank GOD it was only $32. Not even worth that much. Just bought a FitBit One to replace this device.
2,Was not the happy with the pedometer,Was not that please with this pedometer hard too keep and steps correctly and you can't back to dates I had to go back to my old one
5,Great product,I spent quite a bit of time looking at pedometers and gps units before I bought this item. I love the pedometer but cannot get the pc portion to work on a 64 bit pc. The pedometer resets daily at midnight and keeps one weeks of steps in history Very easy to use except for the pc portion. Highly recommend the item. The other bad thing is there is no on off button but for the money a great buy and product.
5,Great pedometer,"This is a really nice looking and easy to use pedometer. The software you can use to track yourself overtime is a nice bonus, but certainly not necessary to give this product 5 stars."
5,Great Pedometer,"This is a great pedometer. This is my second one. NOTE: They are NOT waterproof! I was cleaning the pool with it on and I heard a bloop...looked down, and saw that my Omron had fallen in the pool. I fished it out, and while it still turned on, the mechanism no longer recorded steps"
4,"Great product, seamless syncing...","This is a great product. It syncs seamlessly with my PC, and I've had no issues. It's CRITICAL that in the beginning you set up your step correctly, or all of the tracking will be incorrect. Take the extra time initially to do this, and it will totally be worth it. Would have loved for the Software to also include a heart monitor tracking as well. I purposely bought an Omron Heart Monitor as well hoping there would be some way to coordinate the two to track my workouts on my PC, but no such luck. Still a GREAT pedometer! Love how it tracks both non-aerobic and aerobic steps, mileage, calories burned, etc. best pedometer I've come across!"
4,2nd pedometer,"Love this pedometer even better than my first Omron. Unfortunately it was washed in the washing machine 3 times, hence the purchase of the next level up. I like that I can download the information on the computer and set goals for myself. It is still easy to use and I feel it has been the most accurate of all the brands of pedometers I have ever used."
3,Review of Omron Pedometer,"Directions and use are not particularly intuitive. Modes are written in font so small that it is extremely difficult to read: it is hard to determine if you are in ""Mile"" mode or ""Step"" mode because font is way too small. Would have liked a rotating clip to make it easier to keep the pedometer upright (which is necessary) when wearing. It would be great if you could register two modes of walking when guaging pace, one for exercise and one pace for normal walking."
5,Pedometer,Very easy to set up and calibrate the pedometer and the software is very user friendly. The unit stores over 40 days of readings and displays the past 7 days. Downloading the data to the computer is very straightforward and the software allows the user to track the data in a variety of ways. My wife was impressed enough to ditch her old basic pedometer and take mine so I had to order another one! Even her trainer was impressed with the functionality of this unit.
4,Pocket Pedometer works!,"On the advice of a friend, we purchased two pedometers. They are working very well. I like how you can shift between displays and see not only how manys steps you've accomplished so far, but also the miles. One concern -- we had a hard time putting in the length of our steps. The unit jumped numbers and we wanted one number inbetween. Still, we are very satisfied with them. It's made us more aware of when we can easily add steps each day. I work at a high school and during passing periods I now walk/pace and that alone has added 1,000 steps to my day. Great!"
1,Did not work,"I ordered this for my dad since he walks everyday. It will not take a setting so itdoesn't work. I am going to keep the battery, and toss the Pedometer..I would not buy this again..."
2,Doesn't connect to Microsoft Health Vault,"I bought this product specifically because it claimed to connect to Microsoft Health Vault and it does not. Plus the packaging read HJ-720ITFFP but the back of the pedometer doesn't. I had already sent back one of these and this time decided I would just give up the Health Vault uploading options for step counting. I'm still not sure whether the wrong pedometer was put in the packaging (it was made in China) or whether it just doesn't work as advertised. At any rate, this reached the point of diminishing returns and with this review I have officially given up!"
4,Works Great,I love this product. It's very accurate in both running and walking. I would recommend this product to anyone who wanted to keep track of their distance anytime because you don't have to wear it on your belt the whole time. You can stick it in your laptop bag or purse while your wearing business clothes and nobody knows it's there. The only drawback is that I wish there was a patch to upgrade the software to be compatible with Windows 7.
3,"Some Good, Some Bad","I bought one of these about 2 years ago and have faithfully worn it almost every day. I run and I walk. I started using it while running about 3 months ago. The pedometer is very accurate during a walk, but only counts 50 to 70 % of steps while running. I wasn't too concerned with that as my stride length probably had something to do with that. The strap broke after about 4 months and yesterday the pedometer stopped counting steps. There was no apparent reason, I tried to switch out batteries and to no avail. The product worked reasonably; but the life of the product was a disappointment."
5,everything it is advertised to be,This pedometer is everything it is advertised to be and more. it is as accurateas possible and so so comfortable because you can put it practically anywhere on your body and it will keep track of all of your steps without any problem. i highly recommend it.
1,So Disappointed with Omron,"I was so excited to receive my Omron HJ-7201TC Pocket Pedometer. My Dr. recommended I get it for my new workout program. Went through all the set up, did my walking for the day and was ready to hook it up to my computer. The software does not download to a MAC!!!!! I can't believe the manufacturer wouldn't have software compatible for a MAC! What a waste of time and money. Their download information states I can manually enter the data into their program. Are you kidding me?????? What a waste. I'm probably going to send this thing back. It's useless to me. Amazon needs to state the software is not compatible with a MAC since OMRON keeps it a secret until it's too late!!!Omron HJ-720ITC Pocket Pedometer with Advanced Omron Health Management Software"
3,Would have gotten a 5 if...,"It had software that worked on a Mac.The display is good. The unit is easy to use. Checked the accuracy of it by counting steps. Accuarcy was good. Only downer is I am not sure how I am going to clear the memory when it gets full since I have a Mac. Guess I will just have to reset it with a paper clip. That will require me to re-enter all the settings i.e., stride length, weight, time, etc. That kind of sucks."
1,HJ-720ITC pocket pedometer,"Loved the features advertised. However, recently up-graded my laptop and installed a new hard-drive. The computer assigned a different drive name to the main hard-drive. When I tried to re-install the Omron pedometer disk, it got to the part of do you want to change drives, I click and it FINISHES - does not continue to install. It does not change drives!!!! I contacted Omron via email through their Customer Service. It's been a couple of months with no response. Guess we'll have to invest in another brand, very disappointed with this company."
3,Good product if you walk exclusively,"This product would be great for a person who walks only. I walk and jog so the pedometer is only accurate for one or the other. I assume this is the way all pedometers work but I had not had one before so I was disappointed.Regarding the software, I would have liked some suggestions for goals. For example, I have no idea how many steps should be aerobic each day and some general guidelines would be helpful. Maybe this is located deeper in the software but I did not find it."
5,Omron Pedometer,"I have been very satisfied with this pedometer. It seems to be accurate in recording the steps I take; converts steps to aerobic if appropriate, kcals burned, miles and has an accurate clock. The greatest thing is that it has a strap to attach to your belt loop so that you do not lose it. I would highly recommend this product."
5,A Handy Little Gadget,"I purchased this pedometer earlier this month and have yet to be unsatisfied with its performance. Like all of the previous reviews, the documentation is definitely something lacking. Other than that, it's accurate and comes with software that helps you compare data across several days, weeks, months, and years. This is a great gadget if you want something with a few more features than the average basic pedometer."
4,good pedometer,"4.4 stars. I think overall, the Omron HJ-720ITC serves its intended purpose very well. It is very sensitive and records steps even when it is in my pants pocket. I appreciate the fact that it automatically resets every day. I did not give it 5 stars is because I had to change the calibration of my stride length after the calibrated distance changed for no obvious reason (maybe my stride length changed). Also, when you wear it in the belt clip at your waist, it is still larger, bulkier, and more conspicuous than the more traditional lower tech pedometers. I would have preferred something about half as big. I do, however, love the additional clip that attaches the pedometer to your pants by an attached string, which works to prevent the pedometer from getting lost in case it falls off. I would have already lost it if it weren't for this feature."
1,May destabalize computer,"Paid a little more for this particular pedometer as I was interested in syncing it and creating computer logs. When I attempted to install the software ( Windows XP Home Edition) I received an error warning "" may impair or destabalize the correct operation of your system immediately or in the future. Microsoft strongly recommends that you stop this installation now and contact the hardware vendor"".Should have bought the cheap one!"
2,Don't Purchase,This was a great pedometer for as long as the warranty was valid. Mine stopped downloading the data one week after the warranty expired. It still works but I bought it for the downloaded info feature. I would not reccomend this.Customer Service was not helpful or understanding. I will be purchasing the Fitbit next. Hope it lasts longer than this one.
1,Great Buy.,Just what I was looking for at a very good price. Just stick it in your pocket and it tracts your steps and aerobic steps. You can keep track of your step online. I was very happy with the product until I had to call their Customer Service. The Aerobic Steps stopped working (it stayed at 0). The Customer Service was not at all helpful. They told me I would have to buy a new battery and if that was not the problem I would have to send it back to them at my cost. Both sending and them sending it back. If you buy this and you have a problem just throw it away because there is no warranty.
4,This is a really helpful tool,"I really do like this pedometer. The other reviewers have done a good job of outlining the features. I found it to be very easy to set up, and I really enjoy that I can download my progress to my laptop. This is a great tool to assist in my healthy living journey.My only gripe is that the clip doesn't fit as snugly as I would like, and I have dropped it several times. I wish that Omron could make one just like this in a watch style (still with the USB port) and add the heart rate monitor to it. That, I think, would be a perfect little device. For now, this one works well."
5,So far so good,"So far so good. I like the ability to down load your performance. It is a bit bulky but when you attach it to your belt, it does stay in place."
3,"A Great Pedometer, but...","I concur with all the good things said about this product. However, after about 7 months, my pedometert also stopped uploadinbg data to my computer. I changed USB ports, the USB cable, uninstalled and reinstalled the original software, and finally upgraded the software to the latest version. The pedometer still will not upload data. It seems to start the upload and part way through stops uploading and gives an error message. This message says the upload failed, try again. Repeated tries produce the same result. Also, the battery life of my unit is only about 1/2 of what the manufacturer claims. Otherwise, the pedometer seems to work fine. My time is too valuable for me to record the data manually, so the pedometer is no longer of much use to me."
1,Worked Only for a Week,The product worked fine for the first 6 days then stopped recording aerobic steps. I have contacted Omron by email and have not received any support. $35 wasted.
4,"Very accurate, bit bulky",I find it a big large for an small/medium sized woman. Very bulky at the waist and does not clip to a pocket securly. Has popped off several times.At least i haven't washed it in the machine as I did the Fitbit (twice). Big enough to remember.
2,New Pedometer came Used,"I ordered this pedometer and was so excited about it. However, I was extremely disappointed when i received it and it was not only used and already turned on, wasting battery life, but the manual had someones writing written all over it to calculate their stride and personal information. I am extremely disappointed that i paid for a brand new product and received something very used."
2,i guess you get what you paid for...,"It's a nice product but it is hard to caliber and it is not really meant for aerobics. It may be OK for walkers, but you have to caliber it correctly otherwise it will not record every step you take."
2,Software Install Problem,"When I attempted to install the software for the HJ-7201TC, I received error message 1327 (invalid drive F:). I attempted install from the provided CD as well as from Omron's site. I rebooted computer. I tried install with pedometer connected and disconnected. I tried with my firewall deactivated. It didn't matter what I tried, I continued to receive the above error message. I reviewed the Omron FAQ's both in the book and online. I called Omron - they had no other suggestions. I've done a google search and have not located any resources regarding this error. I'm going to try on another computer, but am very frustrated to seem to be the only one with this experience and no assistance available as I'd like to keep the pedometer and track my results."
4,Best pedometer I have had,This is by far the best pedometer that I have ever owned. It is very accurate. The software makes it very easy to track your progress. I highly recommend this product
2,updated review that used to be a 5!!,"Okay, you can read a good review to see how this thing worked for me for 1 month.. After that, it just stopped working. It is stuck on November 1's data and will not budge or reset. I have tried pushing in the reset button (actually several times) and all it will do is reset the time. The weight and stride remain the same. I have even tried taking the battery out and putting back in, just to have the exact same numbers I ended up with at the end of the day on November 1, 2009. 6.4 miles etc. I have no idea why it would do this. Up until now I was having a great time with the device. I never had one problem with the software like so many other owners. I plugged it into my computer while it was stuck and it logged in some outrageous amount of steps which was impossible since I was at work all day and did not walk around a lot. I sure wish the rest of you better luck!!"
5,GREAT PRODUCT!!!!,"This pedometer is just AMAZING and so much fun! The readouts on your progress, steps, calories burned, etc it so interesting. It is much better than I expected!!!!!"
3,pedometer,This product works great. I especially like that I can use the software to see how much I have been walking on a day to day basis. Very nice product.
4,Other reviewers are correct the belt clip is poorly designed,"I, too, have a problem with the pedometer inadvertently falling off of my belt. I am very careful to place the clip over my belt and not over my pants as well. Still if it gets jostled at all, a-bouncing down the pavement it goes. So far after a half a dozen bouncing episodes, it still is working well. So it is pretty durable. I find that it is especially susceptible to getting loose when I get out of the car. Just a word of warning. It needs a tether or a longer leg on the clip to effectively hold it in place.In spite of my complaint about the clip, the pedometer works extremely well, is very accurate and is an inexpensive fun little device to use to help with exercise. I find myself walking up and down the steps at airports and shopping centers now instead of taking the escalator. Gotta get those 10,000 steps a day. It is easy to calibrate and use. I highly recommend it."
2,dissappointed,I have had a pedometer for a few years...Sportbrain....loved it! I lost itand ordered this as a replacement. Doesn't count all steps and is nowhere bear as motivating. Sportbrain rocks!
4,"It's good, but the clip...","This thing really counts steps well, but unfortunately, the belt clip won't stay attatched if you bend over or sit down or just move around. I must have dropped this thing 50 times in the week that I have owned it. I will have to do some personal modifications to the clip so the dang thing stays put. Other than that the thing works well, a little big to have on your belt, but if you don't want it seen, put it in your pocket."
3,What's up with the battery?,I have changed the battery 2ce in the last 6 months. What's up with that?Otherwise I like this pedometer
3,Omron HJ-720ITC POCKET PEDOMETER w/Advanced Omron Health Management to download to computer,I received my unit 9/30/09 and yesterday the security clip already broke when I was clipping it to my waist band. Now I have to tie it up to use it. It's made of plastic I feel that it should have been made of a stronger material.I also feel that the computer program where I download the information should allow me to type in notes.It keeps track of steps well.
3,Good product but belt clip poorly designed,The product in itself is high quality and performs better than expected. It only falls short when it come to the belt clip. The clip regularly comes off the belt during the day... hitting the ground is prevented by lanyard clip attached to a pocket.I personally have fixed this problem by inserting a small wood screw in the end of the clip. The tiny point of this screw now secures the product to the belt with more confidents.To better hold the screw in place I also applied a small amount of epoxy so the screw would not back out. In reality the clip should have been at least one maybe two inches longer to help compensate for toughs of us whom wear larger belts.Good product...poor belt clip design
3,Pedometer,"I was very excited to get my pedometer. The instructions were straightforward and easy to follow. The unit worked well for about a week and them i began to experience problems. The unit would ""forget"" big peces of time 1-2 days. Soon the unit no longer recognized or registered aerobic steps. Looks like a great package if they could keep it running. Troubleshooting was weak and technical help was an imposible maze. I have simply had to settle for what it wanted to do."
2,Disappointed,"FOR THE NAME BRAND AND THE DOLLAR AMOUNT, I EXPECTED A QUALITY PRODUCT. THIS PEDOMETER HAS REQUIRED SEVERAL NEW BATTERIES AND CONTINUES TO BE A PROBLEM. TOOK IT OUT OF MY POCKET YESTERDAY AFTER WALKING AT LEAST 2 - 3 MILES AND IT TOLD ME I HAD 713 STEPS!! VERY DISAPPOINTED AND I CANNOT RETURN IT AT THIS POINT BECAUSE IT WAS A CHRISTMAS GIFT LAST YEAR FOR MY HUSBAND."
2,Obtrusively Bigger than HJ 112,"The Amazon page gives inaccurate Production Dimension description for this item. Compared to Omron HJ-112 which is 0.6 x 2.1 x 1.4 inches, the HJ-720 is too big (0.6 X 2.7/8 X 1.7/8 - my own measurement,without the clip) to wear on your body 'unobtrusively'. Coupled with the bad top-heavy (clip too low on the unit) design, it is huge and heavy. When I wear it, the top always tilt outward since I only clip it to the pants waist or pocket (I do not wear belt).Returning it without even putting in the battery and will get HJ112(lighter, smaller and less obtrusive) or maybe the HJ151 instead"
3,Simple but good,For the price I couldn't complain at all. Today they have much more detailed technology so this is kinda an old thing now. You can get pedometers the size of a thumbnail.
5,the best!,"The ONLY downfall is that the belt clip is too short.All else is very well done. It keeps good track of distances travelled.Caution, when setting length of step, test your distance in at least 3 different locations and in different conditions. Just average the 3 readings and use that number."
5,Omron Pocket Pedometer,"The Omron pedometer is a great way of tracking my ""movement"" during the day. A much better, and more healthy way of keeping me on track with my health & fitness goals rather than always stepping onto a scale. Also, with the software for the computer, I can visually see my progress, compare active days to more inactive days, and have great feedback when seting new goals. The additional saftey hook keeps it in place & from accidentally loosing it if the clip comes unattached. I wear it everywhere, and the only down-side is that the distances I ride when I'm on a rowing machine or bike is not measured into the pedometer accurately. Guess I need an odometer for those activities!"
1,Like features but can not get all to work,"It is too large, the battery was not included in the package and customer service was not helpful - had to buy a battery, can not get the downloading feature to work. I like the ability to carry in pocket and I like the functions."
5,Great pedometer,"Very happy with the pedometer. It just plain works. I especially like the USB/download capability. The software is pretty simplistic, but is sufficent to keep track of your walking history."
3,Omron Pocket Pedometer,"The pedometer itself is very useful and user friendly and works great. The software that comes with it is however another story. I downloaded the software on my machine running XP. It ran great and downloaded all of my data for about a month. Then I kept having to put the disc back in and repair the software, EVERY TIME I closed the program and tried to re-open it, whether it was the same day or the next day. I had not added or done anything to my computer, so it was not that. Also, several people I work with also bought the same pedometer and some couldn't even load the software on their machines running XP also."
4,informative,I like everything about this product except the carrier or holster. It comes free fairly easy and I've almost lost it a few times. It contains a great tracking program and is affordable.
5,Best pedometer ever,"My father in law purchased one of these for me for christmas and i loved it so i purchased on for my wife. I love the hook up to the computer portion. this thing does all the math for you and makes it easy to set goals for yourself. battery last a little shorter than 6 months, but if the battery goes during the day you loose your steps for the day. overall, i love this product."
2,Wonderful- for a short time,"Great software, great idea... not greatly accurate counting my steps, regardless of hip placement. Software was a fun feature, but it just- died. Replaced battery, new battery was dead in a week. Replaced that battery, just would not work at all. Started ""going black' several times a day. No matter what, eventually would not come back to life. I went back to cheaper, simpler pedometers. This one did not last more than 3 months."
3,Good pedometer,I think the pedometer is sturdy unlike other flimsy ones I have owned that count a step when you sneeze. But I am having a hard time getting it to measure my stride accurately. I have adjusted it up and then down but still cannot get it to match a premeasured distance (both on the treadmill or on an outdoor walk.) Part of the problem may be I walk then run so it isn't working as well as I'd hoped to track that.
3,Just OK,It was complicated and I still haven't quite figured all the features out. It doesn't always seem to add up the steps the same.
3,Too slippery to handle!,"The surface is so smooth that it slips out of my hands. As a 68 year old male, I would not recommend the Omron to anyone who does not have a normal amount of oil on their fingers."
5,Great Product,Purchased this to keep track of my steps each day. It is extremely accurate for both regular and aerobic steps. It also lets you know the number of minutes it took to do your aerobic steps so you can figure your walking speed. Entered my stride length and walked 4 laps around the local HS track. Gave me a reading of .99 mile. Have downloaded data several times and have experienced no problems. I've only had it a month but have had no problems and I'm looking forward to many more. My last 2 pedometers purchased from my pharmacy provided very little data and didn't last very long.
3,Management Software didn't work,"Great device, but worthless without management software working correctly. My data fails to transfer to my computer."
2,stopped working 2 days past return window :-(,"This thing was pretty cool for about a month. After that, it began resetting the count over and over and flashing a low battery sign (even minutes after a new battery was put in). Of course, this happened about 2 days after it was past the last day I could get a refund. Very unhappy and would not recommend. Just get yourself a plain old pedometer. If you have a calculator, you can figure out your mileage on your own, and save your cash for something else."
2,Too big and bulky,"I really liked the idea of this product, liked the upload, liked the added clip thinking it was a good idea, but I really wouldn't need it. Boy, was I wrong! Everytime I bent over the pedometer popped off my waistband. It slips very easily out of the waist clip. It may be great if you wear pants with pockets everyday, but with ladies wear it was conspicuous and too much trouble always reattaching it. I used it two days, and if the packaging hadn't been destroyed in opening, I would have returned it."
4,Great!,"This is the best pedometer I've owned. Particularly appreciate the large type display and different modes. The process of downloading each day's stats is simple and quick. The online smiley faces for achieving goals is a little simple, but I do appreciate knowing daily, weekly and monthly exercise stats. Would recommend this product for anyone!"
5,wonderful product-wish I would have gotten sooner!,"The Omron pocket pedometer is wonderful!! easy to program, easy to download and seems to be accurate. Makes walking fun and I wish I would have gotten this sooner!"
2,Omron has some issues,"I have 2 of these pedometers. Or I should say I had two of them. The leashes are not good and they break, the little plastic clip is not well made and I've broken 2 of them in about a years use. I called Omron and they promised to send out two leashes. Never happened. And you can't buy them.So one of my pedometers finally fell out of my pocket and is gone. And another phone call and I'm told that there is only a one year warranty on the pedometer and that they don't expect it to last more than a year, so it's lasted far beyond what they would have expected. I feel that something I pay this amount of money for should last longer than a year, but evidently I'm wrong. So they wouldn't send me out another leash, so I guess I might as well toss this last pedometer out and buy another one, and you can bet it won't be an Omron. I'm off to do some research."
1,Stopped working after 3 days,"The Omron HJ-720ITC worked great for 3 days. Then it would get stuck and not count any steps, or it would jump huge spans of numbers going from 40 to 80 to 100. It has also started resetting it self back to zero randomly.I do give Amazon support 5 stars. I called them and they are sending me a lable to return the item and I should have the new pedometer in 4 days."
4,Still Walking,I had to re-order when I accidentally went swimming while wearing my first Omrom pedometer (same model). I am addicted to the easy to use features and the downloading of my information. This little product has really kept me motivated.
4,Digital pedometer,"Compact, durable, attractive and technologically advanced pedometer. And, no clip necessary; it goes in your pocket. I'm still not convinced, though, that it's that much more accurate than an ""old school style"" pedometer. I count steps in my head and never get the same count on the Omron. But, it does seem to be a bit more accurate than a normal pedometer. Also, the fact that it syncs to a computer is cool, but it would be easier if it did it with a self-contained USB plug, rather than having to use a separate cable."
3,Omron HJ-720ITC Pocket Pedometer with Advanced Omron Health Management Software,The pedometer itself was super. I returned it because the software with it would not work with Microsoft 7. I talked with Omron and they had no solution for the problem. I had bought this particular model so that I could keep track of exercise on the computer.
5,Motivates Me,"This item is just what I wanted and more. Once I entered the time and my stride length, it was ready to go. Viewing the graphs on my computer at the end of my day is both rewarding and motivating.I really like that the pedometer works at different angles. I just put it in my pocket and go."
3,Easy to lose,"The device seemed like a great tool to get the 10k steps a day recommended, but be sure and double attach it as the clamp that holds it on is faulty."
2,The fell apart in no time,My husband and I each bought one. Lot of trouble to set up and understand. Lots of online tracking materials to fill out. Turned out not to be worth the trouble. And it fell apart so easily.
2,Software problem,"Paid extra for this version so I would have the software to track my status... no where in the description does it mention it only works with window based computer. I have an apple so can't use the software. I like the pedometer, but i'm considering sending it back and getting the less expensive version. Why pay for something I can't use>"
3,Good for walking,"This pedometer is excellent when walking... but if doing other cardio work such as on an elliptical it may nopt be accurate. During a recent workout in which the machine recorded 10,000 strides, the pedometer recorded 8400. I have never had issues when walking."
5,Best Pedometer Ever!,"I love this pedometer! I wear it everyday and it's awesome. Fits in my pocket, it has a belt clip too, and lets me know my progress as the day goes on. Love that it also counts aerobic steps as well! Download the software and see the graph of your achievements! Just awesome!! Easy to use and set up! I recommend this item 110%!"
2,A little bulky,I like all the features and find the steps to be accurate but it is bulky to wear. The clip secures low making it top heavy and it leans forward and shows under clothes. I am use to a very small unintrusive clip-on but this is big. It pops off as it leans and if not for the strap I would have dropped it a few times. If you can just put it in a pocket (which is a great feature) it may be good but I don't always have one so I quit weaning it after 2 weeks. Good device just to big for me.
1,Difficult to set-up,"For the life of me, cannot figure how to set-up this pedometer. The instructions are not good at all. I will have to resort to someone helping me set-up who already has one of these. I'm usually good at these things, but the instructions for this pedometer are not very good!"
3,Metric Version,When I bought the Omron HJ-720ITC I thought it would have both the metric and imperial distance measurement. To my dismay it does not support metric measurement. I had to buy another cheap version from Amazon U.K. which does show metric measurement.
2,I'm very disappointed in both,"I really enjoyed this for the first several months I had it. Then the software stopped downloading, then the pedometer stopped working. I tried changing batteries, uninstalling & reinstalling the software. Nothing. I thought perhaps I had dropped it too many times and bought a 2nd one. Same result. Worked great for a couple months, then software stopped working, then pedometer stopped working.While I enjoy the Aerobic count that other pedometers don't have, I would not buy this one with the software. Will try the other one without the software. If that one flakes out after a couple months, I will stop buying Omron products."
4,Nice product,"I have had the unit a month and it is a motivator! Like the simplicity. Like the software upload. Like the graphics. My only dislike is the ""skimpy"" manual. Very light on features description. A good product and I would recommend to a friend."
5,Good for older person,"As a retired engineer, i love gadgets of this sort and feel most comfortable when I can measure my fitness. Moreover, the tracking software provides motivation to not miss a day. I hate to see a break in the data."
3,good except for download software,I love the way it helps me keep on track of keeping healthy. The only problem i had was the download for the software never worked i had to use a friends cd for the same product.
3,Omron Pedometer,I love the pedometer and would give it a 5 star rating if it had a clip that worked.I had my pedometer for 4 days and lost it because my pants did not have a pocket and I had to clip it on. I only had it on for an hour before I lost it. You just can't tell when it comes off.Omron HJ-720ITC Pocket Pedometer with Advanced Omron Health Management Software
1,2012 and STILL not mac compatible,"Get with the program Omron...I can't believe it's 2012 and I STILL can't use my omron with my mac. I got this as part of a work promotion and I""ve had it for 2 years...unable to use it. What a useless product for about half of all computer users. Fitbit it is then..."
2,Fun While It Lasted,"The Omron HJ-720ITC was more money than I wanted to spend for a pedometer, but the PC link software inspired me to go ahead and give it a try. The idea of monitoring your results on your computer daily seemed liked a good one, and to its credit, the software is fine. The unit itself, however, is typical junk. It worked fine till the first battery change then, the device that detects movement, i.e., counts your steps, just quit working. The display is just happily telling you as you walk for miles, that you are remaining completely motionless.Save your money. Just walk for a specified time everyday and the money you save will buy you a lot of smoothies."
2,Packaging was poor,"Although the actual pedometer is fantastic (I have bought them before and highly rate their accuracy), this particular item arrived without any Omron packaging - it simply came stuffed in a small brown cardboard box with the shipping labels attached directly to it. This is not really a problem unless you are giving it as a gift - which I am - which means I need to somehow get all the shipping and custom labels off it to make it look presentable, or put it in another box - either way, it makes the item look second hand. In short, Dodgy Packaging"
3,Omron pedometer,"I can't really rate this product a this time because it is a present for a December birthday. I like to get my shopping in early. I would be glad to review it after the first of the year. The delivery was excellent, howeve."
2,"Reliable but if you can't carry it, what is the point?","My complaint is that the clip to attach it to you is too short, it is always falling (once almost in the toilet) it may be very accurate, and the best, but when you can't carry it, it becomes worthless"
2,Not impressed,"Does not accurately count steps and can be off by as much as 20%. In addition, it does not count steps that I do to an exercise video, which is stepping or marching in place. You would think it would count those but it does not count accurately. Also it is kind of bulky and not very comfortable when clipped to waist band or belt."
5,FANTASTIC!,"Omron HJ-720ITC Pocket Pedometer with Advanced Omron Health Management SoftwareLove being able to track my steps. Still haven't hit the mystical 10,000 steps but the tracking capability keeps me motivated. Highly recommend. Very easy to use."
5,Totally love it! What more can I say?,"I love this pedometer, and I feel as if I am a bit of an ""expert"" when it comes to pedometers. I have had probably a hundred in my lifetime. This is by far the most effective and accurate. The computer software only adds to the benefits of this pedometer, giving me a full picture of my entire workout. I wear it all my waking hours without any difficulties, and the fact that it fits in a pocket is great. I highly reccommend it, and will never purchase another brand."
1,omron fails to function for long,The omron pedometer worked from mid June to Late September. Then the interface stopped functioning & it no longer works. I won't get this again & my advice is to avoid it or budget to replace it quarterly.
5,Miles add up when using the Omron HJ-7,It is easy to set up and use and is accurate. It helps keep me on a walking schedule and helps define aerobic walking as opposed to casual walking.
2,Fantastic Until the Battery Died,"I bought one for my mom and one for me. We both love it. I haven't had any problems at all. Although, I do recommend using the strap and clip to keep it from falling off.Edited - 11-21-12This was a great pedometer until the battery died. I replaced the battery a few times and couldn't any of them to last."
2,Love it / Hate it,"I love the accuracy of this pedometer. However, it has some major drawbacks. If one does not offload the data, it stops working. Moreover, if it is given as a gift and one has a Mac, the software is useless (and one cannot download the data and the item stops working). Another problem is that the software uses MS Access as a back end and Access database files of the vintage are highly likely to become corrupt (which it has several times over the last four years). By the way, it has been four years and they are yet to update the software, which should say something as well. So while I would say that it is a great pedometer, the promise behind the software is not worth the cost. Buy the HJ-112 and a notebook and use along with a standard spreadsheet and you will be better off."
3,They are right - the clip doesn't hold well,Lost the clip but the tether held the equipment. Now to hack a better clip...
4,Omron Pedometer,Love this product. Like the fact I can download this meter and take it with me to the doctor and we can review my exercise program. Only bad point is the clip. It will come loose from your clothing very easily.
4,Best Pedometer !!,"I walk every day for at least 45 minutes and never owned a pedometer until now. I just love to have thepossibility to get so much information. It tells you the mileage, the steps walked, the calories used andthe aerobic steps. Great product !! Would recommend it to anyone who enjoys walking."
5,Great pedometer!,This pedometer is the best one I have ever used. It's extremely accurate and the daily/weekly/monthly/yearly tracking function is great. I had now purchased a second one for my husband to use.
5,Great Product,I love the pedometer you can download your daily activity to keep track of your progress the only fault is the clip does not stay on your waist with constant movement you have to use the strap to keep from losing it
4,Nearly Perfect Pedometer,"I upgraded from theOmron HJ-112 Digital Pocket Pedometer, which I had found very satisfactory and posted a review. But I wanted to have a permanent record of my walking both on the computer and on Microsoft's HealthVault website. This does it all. My only complaint is the lack of an audible alert when the pedometer is full and won't count any more steps (it holds about a month's worth of data). Only a blinking small...very small...symbol becomes visible on the pedometer screen. It is easy to miss. Otherwise, this pedometer has all the good qualities of the HJ-112 and then some."
5,Washing Machine Tough!,This thing is tough! Earlier today it was in the pocket of a pair of pants and went through a full wash in the washing machine. I then carried it in my pocket for a few hours and now it is fully functional. I am very impressed!
5,Love it!,"Love this pedometer so much ... I bought another one to give as a gift for my sister. By far the best pedometer I've ever used ... and I've used quite a few. It's so great to finally get an accurate step count. Also, the fact that I slide it into my pocket, or purse is great. You don't have to worry about having it clipped just right on your pants. Also, there's not a button that can accidentally get pushed and put you back to zero; it just resets itself at midnight every night, and stores the previous days. Great product ... buy it now!"
5,Love my Omron,"I started out with various free/cheap pedometers. Then I bought a $20 one from another store. It broke in under a month. I heard about Omron and started with the HJ-112. I loved it. After using that for over a year, I upgraded to the HJ-7201TC. I LOVE IT."
4,Omron HJ-720ITC pedometer,"This is a nice pedometer which accurately measures distance, and records number of steps taken, and the proportion of those steps taken that are aerobic. So, just walking about at work does not cut it. You have to do some extended walking before you see that you are doing some aerobic walking exercise. The software is PC only, but it will work in Windows running under bootcamp on an Intel Mac. It will not run under a PC emulator such as Parallels. This pedometer seems to work well whether you put it into a pocket, such as a shirt pocket or on your belt. Highly recommended. I only give it four stars, rather than five, because the software will not work on a Mac."
5,Fantastic,"the product works just as stated, software and hardware are perfect. I highly recomend it to anybody who is looking for an item like this. I would buy from this company again."
5,Love it!,"After purchasing one for my Dad, I bought two more for my husband and I. It's convenient to have the choice of wearing it or carrying it in a pocket or purse. And I love that it stores both regular and aerobic steps, then displays them in a neat graph that shows, daily, weekly, monthly and yearly progress.The only drawback is you need to get a tiny screwdriver to open the case when you replace the battery (a standard watch battery that is inexpensive)."
5,Best Pedometer I have found,"This pedometer is the best I have found and keeps a very accurate record of the daily steps you take. When combined with a great deal from Amazon, ability to upload to the health management software, and ability to print for your records... its just a great product. Battery life is just as discribed - mine was almost 6 months to the day.Highly recommend."
3,Don't they have Beta Testers?,"Amazon offered a package deal with the Omron HEM 670IT Wrist Blood Pressure monitor.that also uses the Advanced Omron Health Management Software. You can store your exercise readings alongside your blood pressure readings. So, I ordered them as a pair.Here's where things go awry. You'd think that Omron would've designed both units to use the same cable, but you'd be wrong. I anticipated being able to use the same cable on both units, leaving one cable at home and the other cable at work, so I didn't have to constantly tote a cable. Well, since the don't use the same cable, I have to tote both cablesThe pedometer uses a Lithium ""coin"" battery (who ever has the right replacement on hand when they need it?) and requires a miniture cross-point screwdriver to change it.I give this combo 3 stars, but with a little forethought on Omron's part it could'a been a 5.A+"
3,"Good for walking, slow to register aerobic","This is a great pedometer. The software is wonderful and shows alot of details. In order for the pedometer to register aerobic steps, it does take at least 15 to 30 minutes of aerobic work-out before it starts counting aerobic steps so that can be misleading. Otherwise, great product."
5,Excellent Pedometer,"I purchased this pedometer about 1 month ago and so far it has worked wonderfully. The holder and belt clip are sturdy and I appreciate that the pedometer comes with a safety strap also. The strap has already kept me from losing or dropping the pedometer several times.The pedometer measures the number of steps taken, distance, number of calories and fat burned, and separately measures aerobic steps taken and number of minutes. Aerobic steps are those that are at a rate of more than 60 steps per minute and last more than 10 consecutive minutes.The ability to download the information from the pedometer to your computer is also a nice feature, especially if you are electronic geek and enjoy seeing your fitness efforts visually represented in graphs. The included software program allows you to set goals for all six of the things measured by the pedometer for multiple users.Overall, I'm very happy with this pedometer and it seems to provide accurate measurements."
4,great pedometer,"Easy to set and love the 7 day memory of steps, calories burned, etc. Its can be put in your pocket or attached to waistband and keeps accurate records."
5,Love this pedometer,Love this pedometer - use it like a pocket watch - great info! A+++ Nice computer upload option!Been a big help to me with my weight loss.
3,Short life,"I've been wanting to write about this product because I've bought three of them. Not because I'm so happy that I want more, but because they die after 1 year.....almost to the day. I'm frustrated that this company can't make a product that lasts longer than a year."
3,worth the price,"At the price, which at the time I purchased it from Amazon, was about 50% less than retail, this pedometer is reliable. It falls from the clip easily; use the attached safety clip to insure that you don't lose it. Software had to be reinstalled; the software kept referring to the blood pressure unit, which is not a part of this item. Appears reasonably accurate, altho these items are not meant to be rocket science. Gives a general summary of walking effort. Prefer this mechanism to the ""pendulum"" devices that are generally cheaper, though some are as much or more than the cost of this item."
2,Uses batteries like crazy,"The pedometer itself is OK. It tends to overestimate steps, but I don't think a perfect pedometer exists, short of attaching sensors to your legs. As long as you use the same one, it will presumably overestimate all the time, meaning you can at least compare measurements across the same pedometer.My main problem with this pedometer, and the cause for its low score, is how often this thing goes through batteries. I go through a battery every 3 weeks, so in a year, I expect I will go through almost 20 batteries. Yow! The pedometer itself may be relatively cheap, but 20 batteries a year for a glorified wrist watch is an amazing feat.I am not surprised to see that the Omron sometimes gets packaged with a set of replacement batteries. That's not a very good sign ...Anyway, buyer beware."
5,Excellent Product,"Each day I have a goal of 10,000 steps. The Omron pedometer keeps me on track. I appreciate being able to down load the information into my computer. Furthermore, seeing how much effort I have to put into burning calories, helps me stay on track with my eating habits."
4,Awesome product,This is an awesome product. I love the fact that it doesn't have to be on your hip to count your steps. I also enjoy that the program keeps a running total for you and you don't need to plug the unit in each day to upload the data. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 rating is because it is a little on the large size. I wear it on my hip for the most part and have had it fall off a few times.
3,"Satisfied, and not","Love the unit, but the belt clips lacks grip. If it weren't for the provided lanynard I'd of lost the thing everytime I wear it. Response from their customer service is very SLOW and not encouraging."
4,Excellent Pedometer / Poor Belt Clip,"I really like this pedometer and the data it feeds my PC. It seems extremely accurate. The setup is a bit complicated, but if you read and follow the manual, it's not horrific. I do have a problem with the design of the belt clip. I find either the clip disengaging from my belt, or, the unit leaving the clip. The tether has saved me a few times from loosing the unit. Currently I'm using it by storing it in a small pouch that is attached firmly to my belt, but I continue to search for a bit better mechanism. It's the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars."
2,Planned Self-destruction?,"I bought my pedometer in February 2008, and worked fine for about 20 months. That's when it chose to stop downloading any data, using their software program.I called Omron, who suggested that I try downloading the pedometer's data to Microsoft HealthVault. I tried, and it failed there, too. The site's diagnosis was a faulty memory in the pedometer.I called Omron back, and the cheerful lady observed that my one-year warranty had expired, and that it would probably be cheaper to buy a new one, rather than repair the one I had. She even gave me a phone number, where I could order a new one. I didn't."
5,Omron HJ-7201 Works as Advertised,"Easy to use and the most accurate ped I have owned. When running, accurate within 2% based on 10 or so validation runs. Desktop software allows you to analyze your daily routine. If you only sync when the device's memory is full (41 days) makes analysis of daily routine more difficult."
1,omron pedometer,"This product is worthless, a waste of money. It is impossible to get an accurate reading in spite of many different settings and trial walks of a measured distance of a quarter mile. Wish I could get my money back.Donald Clawson"
1,Not Mac compatible,"I had another Omron pedometer which I liked very much but it broke and I was looking for replacement. I loved the idea that this pedometer came with software to track steps, etc. I tried to determine if it was Mac compatible before purchasing it but I couldn't find the info, so assuming most all software is now made Mac compatible I purchased it. I was greatly disappointed to find it isn't so I returned it. I'm sure I would love it (based on my other Omron pedometer) if it was could be used with an Apple computer."
4,reliable,"This pedometer is great. It is accurate, easy to read and use. The software management system is good too - helps track progress and monitor exercise goals. The only down side is that the pedometer is a bit bulky."
5,SUPERSCOWEN,I bought this one for my husband so we both no how much we walk every day. He seems to really like this Pocket Pedometer.
2,Great pedometer but...,"It counted steps perfectly and I had no trouble downloading, but the clip isn't long enough so it's not secure. I walked from one end of downtown to the other one night and discovered that it was gone. I wasn't able to backtrack at the time so I'm out $33. The pants I was wearing didn't have pockets or belt loops so the strap wouldn't have solved the problem. It did work well when it was in my purse, but I wasn't carrying it at the time. I'm not sure whether I'm going to bother purchasing another one since the same thing may happen. I can't exactly afford to throw away money like that although I really did like the device itself."
2,Omron Pedometer not worth the money.,"The pedometer does keep track of steps from even inside pockets. This is good as the belt clip is worthless. If I had not tied on the strap, the pedometer would have been lost many times. Also, this pedometer is only compatible with older versions of Windows, not Vista, nor is it Macintosh compatible. The warranty runs out in 30 days, just 5 days short of the internal memory of 35 days. So I have no idea if it will continue to track my daily steps or will just stop working."
1,omronHJ-720ITC pedometer,I would not have bought this more expensive pedometer if I realized the software is for a PC. Mac users of which we are many forget about paying the extra $s for this
1,Disappointed,"I bought the Omron Pedometer to replace a Fit Bit which has quit working. I could not get any support from FIt Bit so decided to try the Omron. Very disappointed. The title states, Comes with software. No software is included in the package and upon review there is no software for a Mac. Now I have this wonderful Pedometer with nothing to track it with.Buyer beware."
3,Omron HJ-720ITC Pedometer,"I've used Omron pedometers for a few years and I've been extremely happy with them. I purchased the HJ-720ITC in order to upload the data to the internet. What I especially liked about my Omron pedometers is the convenience of just slipping the pedometer into my front pants pocket and forgetting about it, even when working out. I don't get this convenience with the HJ-720ITC. When working out, leaving it in my pocket it skips a lot of steps. In order to capture all my steps, I must use the plastic belt clip which has worked so far, but I fear the risk of it flying off if my workout gets too um, energetic."
4,Very nice,"I purchased this pedometer for my husband, beleive me my spouse is very hard toi please. He loves this pedometer, it is everything it claims to be and then some. My husband is impressed with it's accuracy and detailed information given of your progress"
4,Just started walking,"I've just started walking, due to medical concerns, and I purchased this pedometer because my sister has it and she absolutely loves it. She loves how accurate it is and that her progress can be followed on the computer. I haven't used that part of it yet, but as of right now I am very pleased with my purchase."
4,"Good, accurate pedometer","This is a great pedometer - it's actually an acceloremeter, so more accurate than a pedometer. It has motivated me to increase my everyday steps. Easy to use and data downloads to a computer program. Does what it says, seems accurate. Would prefer it was slightly smaller, but the size isn't too bad. I put it in my pocket or clip it onto pants that don't have pockets. I did quite a lot of online searching and thought this on was the best value for the price - and still do."
1,DO NOT BUY IF YOU NEED TO USE CLIP!!!!,"So, I finally got around to hooking the Omron pedometer up to my computer and using it. Easy set up and seemed great in my pocket, but had to switch to the clip today. It's fallen off and been lost as very expensive yard art for someone within the first hour of use. DO NOT BUY this if you intend to use the clip. It's a horrible design with a weak spring and the pivot point is too low to sit snugly on the waist band. As much as I loved the pedometer I will never buy this again!!!!"
4,Easy to use.,This pedometer is easy to use. The instructions were clear. I tried to download the software but was unable to.
5,Pocket Pedometer,"This is a great item to help you get into the groove of exercising. You set it with easy instructions, clip it to your waistband or belt, and forget about it.Once you start wearing it, you quickly realize how many steps you actually take in a day."
2,Omron Pedometer,"I bought this device in June 2011. I have been using it since. About a week ago it started to malfunction. I call the manufacturer and they were able to provide very little help. It has been showing data full signal and nothing I have tried helps. I changed the battery, I downloaded new software, and I tried to reset set it. The manufacturer said I could return for a replacement device but would have to pay to ship to them and send a check or money order to pay for shipping back to me.Overall - this would have been a nice pedometer IF IT WORKED.Go Smart By Omron HJ-720ITFFP Pocket Pedometer with Advanced Omron Health Management Software"
3,"Omron HJ-720ITC Pocket Pedometer, PC Version","This pedometer is a real gem. It is the third pedometer I have owned, and is by far the most accurate & reliable. It has never reset itself. The size is perfect to fit in the watch pocket on blue jeans. The safety lanyard is a great idea. I have had it for two months & the unit has never ""hit the ground"". I would buy it again in a heart beat. The included software compares actuals to targets to see how one is progressing, and the data can be downloaded in a csv file to import into spreadsheets. [Update; the unit stopped updating to any computer after two years. I tried everything suggested on the tech support page, so I downgraded it from 5 stars]"
3,Great for Shorter distance...way off on long distance walks,"I bought this pedometer based on the fantastic customer reviews. Followed all of the set up instructions and got walking. The reason I purchased the pedometer was for the 60-mile breast cancer walk training. Training walks varied from 3 to 18 miles and some back to back long walks (~30 miles over a weekend). For my shorter walks, up to 5 miles, the pedometer was pretty darn close. Once you hit around 7+ miles, the step count is WAY off. I would double check the pedometers accuracy through mapmywalk.com, consistently; the pedometer would be off by upwards of 5 miles! The difference occurred on an 18 mile training walk - said I walked 13.5 miles. This lack of accuracy helped when I participated in the 3-Day, but not great for the psyche during training. To prove my point one more time...I wore the pedometer during the 3-Day/60-Mile walk...Day 1 22.3 miles (pedometer 18.4) Day 2 22 miles (pedometer 17.9), Day 3 15 miles (pedometer 13.3)."
3,"Good pedometer, bad clip","This pedometer did a fine job for me, but I found the clip was not strong enough. It was constantly falling off (and is now lost as a result)."
3,Beware,"This is a very nice pedometer and I feel that it is very accurate, but just be aware that the software will not work with Windows Vista. Fortunately, I have a PC with Windows XP as well, and was able to download the data on that PC. But forget a PC running Vista. The data just won't download. So if the software is important to you, hopefully you have an XP machine.I contacted the company, and they apologized for this inconvenience. They did not mention how long it would be until they would have Vista-ready software."
5,Review oedometer,I am very happy with the pedometer and it works just like Amazon said it would. I always trust Amazon.Alan Bernson
2,"Doesn't work, picks up less than 50% of steps","This looks like a decent product, but we are finding that it only registers 50% or less of your steps. We've tried repositioning it, resetting it up, nothing seems to work. Steer clear if you really want to know how many steps you are taking in a day."
4,Reliable Pedometer,"I purchased both the Omron HJ-720ITC and the ACCUSPLIT Eagle AE1691M17 pedometers when my 20 year old Radio Shack unit finally quit. There is no comparison in the reliability of the units with regard to actually counting steps. It is difficult to stop the Omrom from accurately counting whereas the ACCUSPLIT is critically sensitive to orientation, placement on the body and being dislodged during activity.The ACCUSPLIT has been returned and is being replaced by a second Omron unit."
3,Big and clumsy,"Yes, this pedometer is accurate and helps with motivattion but honestly, it's larger size and the fact that it pops off every time I bend over is a nuisance. (Yes, the little leash keeps it from landing in the street or toilet each time.) I got onto this site with the full intent of returning it but because of all the praise for it's accuracy, I decided to keep it. However, I can see that it may end up in a drawer because of it's poor design though. I hope the designers get the message and fix these things since it's obviously got some real advantages over it's competitors."
4,Walk to health,I have found having purchased cheaper pedometers that owning this one is far more rewarding. It keeps very acturate track of the daily as well as weekly active in your life when it comes to taking steps. I knows what kind of walking you do not just the steps you take. It allows you to make the necessary changes to your life style that can improve your health.
5,Best Pedometer EVER!,"This pedometer is amazing! It's very accurate, small enough to carry in your pocket and easy to use. The fact that it resets itself everyday is great. The software is easy to use too and even tells you how many steps you walk each hour of the day, not just for the day total. You can set your goals and then when you plug in the pedometer and load your information it tracks it against your goal. If you've met your goal you get a smiley-face and if you haven't you get a frowny-face...it's funny how a frowny-face can motivate you to do better!!Overall, this is the BEST pedometer I've ever used and the price is fantastic for all it does."
3,Great pedometer -- softwear download issues,"First off if you are looking for a great pedometer, then this is the right choice; HOWEVER!!!, if you want it to download the information, this is NOT the right choice. I purchased this pedometer because of the ability to download to my PC. It worked great until a couple of days ago then the softwear download quit working. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the softwear with no change. At first I seriously thought about sending the unit in for repair as requested by the customer service rep until I read that the other reviews -- this sounds like a design flaw. Therefore, I am ordering the Oregon Scientific PE830 pedometer that has the capability of downloading to my PC."
4,It's the best!!,I have used other pedometers and they were hard to understand and figure out. The Omron has been an asnwer to my prayers. Thank you so much!!!
4,Great for tracking,"This product is tough, durable and excellent for tracking steps, and especially arobic steps. The only problem I have had with it is if you wear it to work, and you have any pudge at the waist, it get puched off your slacks or skirt. But small price to pay for watching your steps and getting healthy."
5,Great way to count steps,"I've really found this pocket pedometer to be the solutions to all the problems I've had with other pedometers. Although I've never lost a pedometer down the toilet (which people in my walking program have done), the belt pedometers have fallen off while hauling brush, sawing logs, and even while hiking. With the Omron pedometer in my pocket, those problems are non-existent. Secondly, with other pedometers they reset themselves, often half-way through a walking session. This has never happened with Omron. Lastly, I wasn't very good about remembering to reset and record step counts every morning. The Omron does this automatically for you and not only resets, but keeps a record of the past seven days (visible) and more days in its memory. Having the ability to down load step counts to my computer is a great advantage. The price to utility value is very high and I've gone through many pedometers of varying costs to arrive at this point."
5,Pedometer Is As Advertised,"I bought this pedometer from Amazon for my wife at Christmas. It's an item that she had on her generic want list. I also bought the little leash for it to prevent loss. I thought that the leash plus separate shipping was a bit pricey for what amounts to a piece of string to tie the pedometer to oneself to prevent loss. However, I had the money and it was a Christmas present that I wanted to arrive fully equipped and nice looking. (Leash reviewed separately)The pedometer is better than expected and more or less reasonably priced (though that's intuitive; I did no research). My wife is tickled with it. It does all she wanted from the gift and more. She's now been using the item for nearly two months and has not had any malfunction or other problems with it. I recommend it."
1,JUNK,"I bought it from AMAZON on March 30, 2012. It stopped working completely on September 25, 2012. It is now in the trash. Perhaps I'd have better luck getting something made in this or a European country because I've had too much trouble with CHINESE products failing prematurely!"
5,Just Perfect!,"Everything about this pedometer is exactly what you need, insuring you will get your 10000 steps in per day! Easy to conceal, set, and read. It can be worn under clothing or securely attached just about anywhere; belt loop, purse, pocket, etc. It is silent too. No constant clicking! Should I ever need a second, I would definitely buy this again!"
2,Omron Pocket Pedometer,"This pedometer is more than 5% off for mileage, time, etc. I know how far it is from point a to point b and the pedometer says I walked .50 miles when I know I walked over 1 mile. That is 50% off how far I walked."
5,Love it,I love this product and even moreso that it connects to the computer! I am able to view my steps and aerobic steps on the computer! I use it everyday and make sure to either keep it in my pocket or I attach it to my clothes but it is the best and I would recommend it to anyone!
4,Excellent choice,"I love this pedometer. It tracks everything I need tracked (steps, aerobic steps, miles, calories, etc). Love the fat grams burned display in aerobic walk mode. The included software is simple an easy to install and track your walks. I highly recommend this model."
1,"Good pedometer, Just hope everything works and you don't have to return it.","I used this pedometer for two and a half weeks without any problem. For me the selling point was the USB connection. I was able to download to my computer and keep track of my activity level.Couple days ago I plug my pedometer into my computer to download the data and received ""The (sic) data transfer failed, please try again"" and from then on it refuses to upload data. I tried rebooting, reinstalling the software, reset the pedometer, and even did a clean install on my notebook and it would not work.I called Omron today and the lady wants me to send it back to them PLUS five dollar for the return shipping!! It seemed ridiculous that I should pay for shipping both ways for a product that lasted a couple of weeks!I will not be sending my pedometer back since the shipping both ways will cost around half of it's value. Rest assured with that kind of return policy I will not buy another Omron product again."
1,Not reliable,"Within two months the data transfer failed. No fixing it. This is a common problem. If you take a look around, you will see I was not the only one."
1,Software is Garbage,"Pedometer itself is decent and seems to work well. Software worked for a while and then refused to download any more data. Eventually, the unit will fill up with data (after 35 days) and no longer works. You cannot reset the data in any way by removing the battery or using the reset button on the back of the unit. Uninstalling and reinstalling the software has no effect. Based on some of the other reviews this seems to be a problem with how the unit interacts with this software.Once the data transfer fails the pedometer has 35 days of life left. Mine no longer works and has went into the trash. Do not buy this product; it is a total waste of money."
1,"Do not count on the software, 2nd unit stopped working too","After 30 days of use the software gives an error during uploading and never finishes. Seems a number of people have experienced this problem. No solution offered. I would get the cheaper model and NOT rely on the software. I mailed it back to the company to fix it, they just mailed me a new one. Product must be defective with software. The second one stopped working after 2 months.Do not count on the software, but the pedometer works as a pedometer."
5,love it!,I really like this and the software is awesome because I can set goals for myself and it uploads data from the pedometer to tell me how I'm doing. It's easy to use and I've had no problems with it. This was a great buy!
5,Omron Pedometer is an excellent purchase,"Excellent product and features, very easy to set up and use. Very accurate and the new PC data downloading capabilities--and the resulting graphs the data produce--are a terrific motivator!!Now, if they could only add a feature in which one could compare and ""compete"" online with other Omron HJ-720ITC users."
5,pocket pedo,This is by far the easiest pedometer I have ever used. So much better that the ones the clip on to waist band. It doesn't make that clicking sound like so many others do fits right in your pocket. I will be ordering 2 more for family members. Thanks again
2,Pedometer,"Pedometer works fine for readouts. THe computer hookup, no. Initially it worked, and did for a day or two, then it no longer imported data. I reloaded, still didn't work."
4,I keep coming back,"My husband and I both use the Omron pedometer that downloads information to the computer. I find it to be pretty accurate. My husband and I have worn out several with my husband going through about twice as many as I do. I have to replace about once a year, my husband about 2-3 times a year. That sounds like a lot perhaps, but other brands he has tried only last about 60 days for him. He seems to be very hard on them. We both wear them all the time. This last one I am replacing because it quit downloading even though it still works fine. I just missed the downloaded information."
3,Its Ok but isn't for everyone,"This is Ok for what it is. Only complaints are the stride length and unable to reset when you want to. It doesn't go below 1' 08"". Being a shorter person, nothing is accurate except steps. Resets at midnight only. I need to calculate distance and time several times a day. Not compile them. Customer service is a joke. Questions posed in an email are "" too difficult and time consuming to deal with in an email"". Spend your money somewhere else."
2,Not very international friendly,"Typical American attitude to global markets - I.e. Ignore them! The product does not work in metric only miles, calories, etc.Such a pity when most of the world is metric. It would have been nice to know this limitation before buying."
1,poor carry design,The holder and waist clip are so poorly designed that it is offensive. I have lost 2 of them. they are so top heavy that they cannot be used much. They even include a lanyard to clip to your belt. This is because they know it will fall out as soon as you bump it. the program is nice though.
2,Cable Interface Problems,"The pedometer seems to be pretty accurate although it would have been nice to have 2 stride modes (walk, run) to accurately track mileage. My biggest problem is that I get errors uploading the data. It get about a third of the way through and gives me a red X - Error try again. It failed on 2 computers so there is a cable or pedometer error."
3,"satisfied but no metric, only us unit system (miles)","product fine, i was just dissapointed because it did not have metric system.i wanted to use it with KM and not with Miles.on the other hand, I have not installed the software with the PC yet."
2,disappointed,"There is no way to reset or shut this thing off. I have to remove the battery every night, that is the only way to turn it off. It does not reset every time. I have had 2 separate occasions where the data from two separate days were combined and there is no way to fix it. I walked for 1.5 hours yesterday and it only logged in that I walked for 14 minutes...and I cannot get yesterdays data from displaying as today's. So far I have taken 5871 steps, but I haven't put it on yet...you figure that out, because I can't.It's all good in theory, but in reality, not so much"
2,Omron HJ-720ITC Pocket Pedometer with Advanced Omron Health Management Software,"I don't know what I was thinking... If you walk the same distance every day it is totally useless product. The distance and calories are measured based on the wight of your step...No accurate. Also, you can only walk, not run. I would not purchasew or recommend this product again."
2,lasted less than a month,"I have used this brand of pedometer before and loved its features. I gave my old one to a friend who wanted to start walking knowing I could order another one on Amazon. What a mistake! This one arrived and I immediately started wearing it at the gym. Within three days I noticed that it needed to be reset so I had to go through the time set up and the stride calculations. ABout every day or two the screen would flash off and again I would reset the numbers. Within a week after this, it bummed out completely. I changed the battery. Still nothing. It is now sitting in the box. I am not willing to pay shipping (again) to send it back. The shipping here and back is more than the price of the pedometer. Mine was a dud."
3,Short life span,I was disappointed and should not have purchased. The pedometer did not even last 3 months. When I replaced the batteries for the first time I was no longer able to set the correct height.
2,This didn't work out for me,"I purchased this in 2008 hoping to track my steps and get 10k a day. But unless you where this really high (on the belt), it just doesn't work. And even at the belt, it didn't seem to work well. It would count small movements as steps. In the end, this was a waste of money for me."
3,A Typical Pedometer,Works as advertised. Not too big. Fits in front pant pocket although not convinced it works as well as wearing on your belt. Easy to upload results to PC. Would recommend to anyone who needs to count their steps.
1,Okay Product for for the price,I still have yet to figure out how to download the information from my unit to my computer. Hopefully someday I will be able to figure this out. But the counting part of it is fine!!
3,omron pedometer,pedometer did not come with the management software. you need this software because the pedometer has limited memory and you need to upload this to a computer
4,"Omron Pedometer, Very Good","I recently purchased a Omron pedometer. It works very well and the 42 day memory/history is a real plus. It actually works in your pocket (as advertised) should you wish not to clip it on clothing. Initially, I found the set-up instructions somewhat difficult to follow. But, with a bit of effort I soon had it operational. For the price, it is the best pedometer I have found. Would recommend it only for the serious athlete. It is over kill for the occasional once-around-the-block user. For the record, I am way, way over the age of 13!"
5,omron HJ720itc pedometer,"I bought a cheap pedometer at a disccount store for $4.99. it lasted 2 weeks and broke. it was not very accurate. I bought the Omron HJ720ITC and used it for a week and bought my wife one. the distance is very accurate and easy downloading of daily results on the computer keeps track of our progress and challanges us to do more. The only down side is the belt clip, its to small and comes off our waistband. we use the lanyard thats included just in case it falls off the waistband.I highly recommend this pedometer for anyone on a walking program"
2,"bought for running, can be used for walking only","I got this piece to measure mainly the distance and the calories burnt during my runs. It doesn't work this way. The maximum step is 4 feet, when my regular is 5 feet long average. It's showing incorrect data, i.e. when I run longer distances than a day before, it'd show otherwise.The software is not user friendly. It took me quite a while to find out how to switch from one screen to another. I am about to give it away to my kid to play with it. It is useless for me."
5,It Works!,"I've had 3 pedometers and this is the best one yet. I love the software, it's easy to use and I like seeing what I've done in the past. I put the pedometer on the minute I wake up and take it off when I go to bed. It's accurate, the directions are easy to follow, and the software is easy to navigate. I'm thinking of getting the blood pressure monitor and linking the systems through the software."
5,Fitness motivator!,"This is a great product for anyone who is trying to monitor and increase the time they spend on daily cardio activity, or just plain keeping track of how many steps you take every day. It is very accurate and the software is easy to use."
4,Pedometer,"It's my first pedometer to measure my daily walking activity, to keep in pace and set goal for better well being. The software that come with the product was helpful in plotting your progress and what day was the weakest. Im ipmpressed of its sensitivity despite its frequent fall-off during jogging. but in general it was a good and accurate pedometer."
5,EXCELLENT!!!,"This item is fantastic!!!Small enough to fit in my pants pocket.Very accurate.Has been dropped many times and been chewed on by my cat, yet it still works very well.The fact that the data can be downloaded is wonderful, I can compare how much I walked with previous months.Simply put, if you want to start a walking program and don't want to have to make your own graphs or what not, this is an excellent tool to do it with.My only problem is that I couldn't find this product in Canada - and Amazon wouldn't ship it to Canada either, so I had to get it mailed to a friend in the US and pick it up next time I visited. Oh well, they should be available on our shelves soon."
5,Great Purchase,Been using his for several weeks and its everything I wanted and more. Just wanted something to track my steps and log them onto my computer which this unit does but it also tracks how many of my steps are aerobic and how many miles I've walked just to name a few. I am very happy with this purchase.
5,Good product. Very accurate,Could be a little more user friendly but overall more accurate than any pedometer I've ever had. Easy to wear.
5,The Best!!,"This is the best Pedometer!! I had the older version that is pretty much the same except the this newer version can download onto the computer! It keeps all your stats and records them with excellent accuracy! I love being able to just plug in the USB and download my info!! Excellent for a busy mom with 5 kids who walks the treadmill everyday!! It is very durable and the clip with the lanyard is really smart! It takes a lot for the Pedometer to detach, but a really nice not to worry that I will lose it, due to the heavy duty clip! Excellent product!"
3,Omron Pedometer,Nice product. Received quickly. Product was missing CD-Rom and I am unable to log my progress online. Other than the missing CD the OMeon Pedimeter is great. Just wish I could log progress.
4,Nice unit,"The Omron unit seems to be more accurate than ones I've tried in the past. My wife wears hers on her belt. The tether that comes with it prevented it from being lost when it falls of, as is what happened with her last pedometer. I always keep mine in my pocket. It works fine there and I really didn't want one that was belt mounted, as I already have two belt mounted devices. If I had one complete, it seems to count about 10-15% high on the steps function. The midnight reset function is also a nice touch."
4,Omron Pedometer - Advanced,"I can't say enough good things about this pedometer. Although I've not installed my software just yet everything else about this pedometer is great. It took a minute to get my strides logged but I got it done. I think that logging your strides prior to utilizing any pedometer is crucial in order to increase the accuracy of any pedometer. No two indvidual's have the same stride and therefore, calculating ones steps will always be different from the next person. I would recommend this product to the next individual looking to get serious with logging steps accurately. I've also found that this pedometer will calculate aerobic steps accurately along with the length of your aerobic workout. It will also log your elliptical workout under your aerobic steps which is what I was looking for in a pedometer. Along with your aerobic time."
4,Omron HJ-720ITC Pocket Pedometer,Very good pedometer for cost. Software is a nice tracking tool; but not too advanced. Pedometer provides a variety of information. I like the fact it stores 7 days on the pedometer. You can download up to 41 days I believe from the pedometer itself via the software. Definitely a good investment and I highly recommend.
4,Omron Pedometer,"This pedometer has good and bad features, but for the most part I really like it. The problems I have with it are that it is a bit bulkier than the other peodometer I owned prior to this one, and it comes unclipped fairly easily. The feature I like most is that you can download the information to the software that comes with it, which tracks how you're doing against goals and stores historical information. I also like that it tracks aerobic steps."
5,Onron Pedometer,Great device! My wife has it around her neck on a nice black neckless and wares it all day. We down load to the computer every few days and it gives a nice readout we can compare. Easy to use and works perfectly.
5,Outstanding everyday fitness tool,"I've used my Omron HJ-720ITC pedometer a couple of months now, simply slipping it into my pocket each day as I head out for work. It works very well, counting my steps as a walk several blocks across downtown from my parking garage to my office. Watching the tally, I can easily add extra walking to bring my total daily mileage to an ever increasing level.The unit seems to work well in my pocket; no need to clip it to my belt like more basic pedometers. So far it's holding up very well with no signs of wear and tear.The software is easy to use and provides a handy record of daily walking however I find that simply noting my daily walks gives me sufficient feedback to keep me on target for a walking exercise program.I'm amazed how well the device works and recommend it to anyone seeking a straightforward, accurate method of keeping track of walking exercise."
5,An excellent pedometer,"I have been using a pedometer for about a year and have had about five! The last one, from Wal Mart for $5, told me I had done 5,000 steps during grocery shopping. I wanted something reliable and finally gave up on the cheapies and went with Omron.I have had an Omron blood pressure monitor for fourteen years and it still looks and works like the day I bought it so I knew that Omron was a quality product.The pedometer doesn't dissapoint. It doesn't just track your steps... it keeps track of the steps you make each hour so you can see patterns. It also calculates the steps and time you spend aerobic walking. Best of all, if you don't want to wear it on your belt, it works just great in your pocket.The software is easy-to-use and very informative.This may be a lot more expensive than the pedometers at Wal-Mart but it's well worth the money."
4,Great product,"This is my first purchase of a pedometer - I bought 2 to help my husband and I track our daily activity and get more active. Easy to activate and setup, and tracking the week's steps with the ""history"" function is a snap. I have not used the computer transmission function, but plan to this summer. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the belt clip needs to be a little longer/tighter, in the event that you wear it on a waistband that isn't extremely sturdy. I have dropped mine SEVERAL times as a result of it slipping off my waistband from a sitting position (I wear it all day). When I wear with jeans or belted pants, its fine, but if I have on cotton running pants or some other light material, the belt clip is too loose to do the job. However, I suppose the good news is, even with all those ""drops,"" it still works great. As a bonus, I wasn't even sure my husband would use his, but he tracks his activity daily too because he likes it so much. Would recommend it to anyone!"
3,Omron HJ720itc pedometer,"The product works as advertised. It is not 100% accurate in counting steps, but it is pretty close. Would I buy this product again? Yes, I would."
3,It's adequate,"I bought this pedometer as a replacement for my smaller Omron pedometer which cost less than half. Although this does everything it says it does, I don't use the software program and the pedometer continually falls off my waistband. If it didn't have a safety strap, I would have lost it on the first day I wore it. If I have to replace this pedometer, I will definitely get the smaller model and purchase the safety strap. I can't figure out why this unit has a case/holder. The clip should be on the pedometer, that way it would be less apt to fall off the waistband."
2,"Good Device, Dumb holder","Nice gadget, but does not come close in presentation to that of fitbit or gruve. the real killer on this is the design on the holder for the device. this is a much larger device then than the others. in fact, almost as large as a glucose testing meter, whereas the others are much slimmer and not as easy to lose. This device shows plenty on it's digital display, but the holder is poorly designed and in the 5 days since i have had it, it has fallen off my belt twice. the company provides a tether for the unit that you can clip to your pocket in case it falls off, but to me that is a band-aid and a bad one at that. the holder plan and simple should have a deep enough clip to sit over your belt or pocket instead of on top of it. that would minimize the danger of losing it. also, it comes with the tether which didn't seem clear since amazon noted that others bought a tether available separately (as did I only to find out i didn't need it since one was in the box)."
2,While it worked it was great --- then not so much!,Everything was fine and it worked as stated. After 3 months it started skipping steps. I got a new battery and that didn't solve the problem at all. Hmmm look at other options.
5,Simply The Best,"Easy to use, accurate and addition feature: data downloadable to PC with software to chart your progress. I highly recommend it. Buy, along with it, ""Pedometer Walking"" by Fenton & Bassett"
3,"Liked it, but it quit working after only FIVE mos :(","I bought two of these, one for a Christmas gift for my BF and one in 02/2008 for myself. Mine quit working after only FIVE months. Just quit. Changed battery (even though low battery warning was not showing before it crashed), but apparently the battery wasn't the problem. My BF's is still working, but needed battery replacement after about six mos. I really liked the Omron pedometer; easy to use and it seemed quite accurate on number of steps. I just ordered a Lifestyles NL-2000 ($59.95+Shipping) to replace my Omron.Omron HJ-720ITC Pocket Pedometer with Advanced Omron Health Management Software"
5,walking tall,"My new Omron pedometer is all I wanted it to be...only one thing to be careful about...it needs to be secure in its placement, and not angled outward (no clothing bunched between it and the body). Definitely a good perchase!"
4,Pretty Solid Across the Board,"I owned the previous edition -- I bought this version because it promised new utilties -- intrusion detection, admin tools, ... for the most part, I have been happy. [The old edition provided the tools on a CD -- the new book has a companion Web site] -- trying to download the tools through my firewall can be challenging -- especially anything that has to do with viruses ...That said, however, the new content is good.The book has a definite slant towards Windows. But then ..."
5,Hacker Proof: The Ultimate Guide to Networking Security,This book was detailed and concise. The online companion is an excellant compliment as well!
2,A thriller that never thrills,"Limp, lackluster plot with uninspired acting and uninteresting characters. The only possible point of interest is Marcia Gay Harden of 'Miller's Crossing.' She hasn't had many good parts other than that film, and this isn't one of them."
4,A great CD to listen to.,I would recommend that this CD be an addition to anyones collection. Curtis has a Joe Satriani/ Eric Johnson feel. This is an up comming artist that will go far. I also like the fact that half of the profits go to cancer charities. This is someone who is in touch with that around him.
3,"The best piece in this set, but the set as a whole sucks","This oven mitt is the least crappy element of Typhoon's Capsule set, but the set as a whole is really frustratingly bad. The dye fades significantly when you wash these pieces, but it doesn't fade evenly between items so it looks very bad. The oven mitt is like any oven mitt - a little awkward, a little helpful - but it's not as heat-resistant as some of the new-fangled insulated ones, and the magnet is often not strong enough to really hold it up, so that's irritating. Overall I would recommend you away from this entire line."
5,"Great map, durable and well made.","I love the Easyfinder laminated maps from Rand McNally. They are extremely durable, meaning I won't have to repurchase a map that gets torn, spilled on, or just plain worn out. Even better, I can mark my routes & destinations on them with dry erase marker, then just wipe off when no longer needed. Map detail is top notch, as you would expect from Rand McNally. Great for local tag sale bargain hunting or longer trips. 5 stars, definitely my favorite maps. From the Big Dig to the Museum of Science, this is the one that goes in my pocket."
4,desperate crossing,"this movie brought the past to our present by being a drama and also a documentary,this makes you see the begining of our great nation,how Christians"
3,Desperate Crossing: The Untold Story of the Mayflower,"I was disappointed. It did not cover the subjects that I hoped it would. Several family names weren't even mentioned, John Howland and John Tulley for instance. If I knew that there was no mention of John Howland and others, I would not of bought it."
3,Modern History,"On the whole, this is an above average film. The naval scenes are riveting, the costumes are authentic, and the acting is passable. The largest problem is political correctness. Those contemporary Indians interviewed about their forbears at Plymouth, for example, are often just silly. When the white men landed, ""We saw them but they didn't see us. We were one with nature."" And the like. Moreover, the theology of the Puritans and Separatists could have been discussed at more depth; the distinctions are critical to the story. But perhaps that's asking too much of the History Channel. According to the iron rule of PC, Christianity must almost always be mere supersitition."
5,Facinating loved it!,"This Video was absolutely fascinating, highly recommended for history buffs. Tells the story really well of the plight of the crossing then the actual settlement, really well done. I had no idea this is where the American Thanks Giving came from, it gives it so much meaning to me now! I am from Australia!"
2,Disappointing DVD,"I'll save space and say that I agree with the other posts that laud the show for it's quality and usefulness.Unfortunately, the DVD is seriously flawed. Amazon lists the aspect ration as 1.78:1 but technically that is not correct. Just as the History Channel did with the Dogfight series, the DVD is actually letterboxed 16:9 matted into a 4:3 frame. Why the History Channel continues to use this outmoded format for their DVD releases is a mystery. Even cheap direct to video DVD releases are in anamorphic format. I can author a disc in anamorphic format on my home PC so it can't be that hard or expensive to do.If you have an older home theater system, this disc being letterboxed may not matter to you but if you have a HDTV with your DVD player connected via HDMI, it is likely that you will not be able to watch this in other than letterbox format without lowering the resolution of your system.Come on, History Channel, move your DVD releases into the 21st Century."
4,Good telling of a compelling story...,"As a history teacher I am often amazed at the lack of knowledge that many people have about the real hardships that the Pilgrims faced. This History Channel production brings those hardships to life without slipping into hagiography. The settlers of Plimouth Plantation were, like the settlers of Jamestowne before them, ordinary people who faced extraordinary hardship."
4,"Great, Except for the Brief Periods of PC","This is a compelling story of people who seek to trust God for their means and sustenance. There are several brief periods of ""political correctness"" which are both self evident and self contained. Other than these (brief) obligatory sidebars, it is first rate."
4,Babyface is in supreme loverman mode...,"This may well be Babyface's best solo album to date, and one of his last projects with partner L.A. Reid, who would go on to focus on executive duties. Face is the definition of COOL throughout the album, starting with the album's title track. His second single, ""Never Keeping Secrets,"" further escalated his popularity, as it became a top 10 hit. His next single followed in that format, ""And Our Feelings,"" which featured his wife in the music video. The album's biggest hit, ""When Can I See You,"" drew rave reviews with the use of simple acoustic sounds and smooth vocals. Definitely a must own for contemporary R&B music lovers worldwide..."
5,One of the best ever in RnB!!!!!,"With the number of successful albums he has produced, the number of songs he has written for others and the fact that he can play the piano and guitar so fluently....It is very well possible that many people would agree that he is one of the best ever to come around in RnB. His album ""For the cool in you"" Is simply off da hook!! With hit songs such as ""For the cool in you"", ""and our feeling"",""rock bottom"",""a bit old fashion"" are songs that exemplify the beauty and fine work of Babyface. This CD is a must have, as is all of his albums!!!!"
5,the sound man of the decade,the baddest writer&producer of the 90's nuff said.he has lasted longer than the Timex watch he just keeps hitting&hitting. this album is my personal fav of his. it's the last one of his i liked all the way thru. The Day&Mtv unplugged were okay they had moments but they felt to industry to me like a private party. but for the cool in you is a record that gives so many moments and thoughts and it still holds up. how many prolific artist can write&produce at an alarming rate and still hit with a solid great record like this? i also recommend Tender Lover.
3,For the Cool in You,"I found this to be an easy listening copulation of old and new tracks. Very enjoyable overall. The bonus tracks were a nice extra. If you are a Babyface fan, this is a must to add to your collection."
5,"One of the best albums of 1993, and makes mincemeat out of all his other albums","Contrary to what many people say, I think this album makes a good argument against the accepted belief that Babyface makes better music for other people than he does for himself. ""Never Keeping Secrets"", ""And Our Feelings"", ""When Can I See You"", and the title song were all over urban contemporary radio in 1993-94; just as good were ""Lady Lady"" and ""A Bit Old Fashioned."" I bought the cassette back in '93, and the first time I listened to it was in the car one night when my mom and I were on our way back from eating out, and to this day, whenever I'm in the neighborhood where that restaurant used to be, I always think of this album."
5,tight Album by Babyface,"along with R.kelly, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder and Lionel Richie, Babyface for me is in that list of the Most Important Living Artists. not only has he left a lasting mark as a Songwriter and Producer for others,but his solo career was also banging as well and this Album is tight and is my last Fav Babyface album. the title track was smooth as was ""Lady,Lady"", when can I see you again"", and Our feelings. Babyface truly showcased his versatility as a All Around Artist. Babyface was tough in the 80's and 90's. this Album along with R.Kelly's 12 Play were my two most played albums that i grooved to back in 94. tight album by Face."
3,"Good story, stilted dialogue","I thought the story was pretty good. It kept me reading. I was constantly distracted by the stilted dialogue, though. People talked to each other using Victorian English rather than the way Americans (even rich New Englanders) talk. When a common verb or noun would suffice, the author uses a longer word. That's fine enough for prose, but not dialogue. I kept saying, ""who talks like that??"""
2,Mary Higgins Clark has lost her intrigue!,"I used to look forward to every new offering by MHC; however, in 'I HEARD THAT SONG BEFORE', she seems to have lost her ability to inspire.She only seems able to write about an 'elite society' that is foreign to most readers. The Carringtons are filty rich but her rambling on with familiar modifiers and boring details has finally taken its toll on this reader.She might only be able to recapture my interest IF she were to write about some 'ordinary folk' like those offered by the alphabet mystery heroine, Sue Grafton.This book was a waste of my time and, I suspect, that of many of her previous loyalists."
2,Could have been better,"I think the fact that I found the heroine, Kay rather vapid and her husband Peter Carrington, one dimensional, turned me off on this book. There was some suspense concerning who killed Susan Althorp and Grace Carrington and what happened to Kay's father. Kay was rabidly loyal to her husband arrested as a suspect for murder but there was little shown about their relationship and what led them to marry in the first place.It's a page turner but there are some long stretches and also the conclusion left (at least to me) some unresolved issues for Kay."
4,SHE'S BACK,"I have read almost all of MHC's books. I enjoy romantic suspense stories, and was disappointed with the last one, Two Little Girls in Blue. I decided to give it another chance with this book, and was glad I did. It was written in the style of her previous mystery stories in which you keep guessing throughout the book who might be involved with the murders. I couldn't put it down because each clue just made you want to keep reading to find out who it was. This one was really enjoyable."
1,Heard that Song Before,I've read all of MHC's books and this is pure drivel. I started reading this book back in March and probably won't finish it. I even went back to see if it was written by someone else and she just put her name on it. The characters are barely one dimensional. There is absolutely no interest sparked in finding out more about them. What I've read so far has been a total waste of time and certainly not in keeping with MHC's style.
4,I heard That Song Before,"I have not listened to this story as yet,but I have no doubt that this Audio CD Book will of excellent standard as usual."
2,No thanks.,"In the past, I have generally enjoyed reading Mary Higgins Clark books, but this one fell short of my expectations. The characters were unlikeable as well as unrealistic, the plot merely pieced together, the switch from first to third person annoying, and the ending abrupt with your typical ""happily ever after"". She has written other excellent books, but this is not one of them."
5,Heard that Song Before: A Novel,"Mary Higgins Clark is wonderful. Her books are short enough to read a chapter here and there, yet keep your interest. Until the last 15-20 pgs, I didn't have a clue as to who the culprit was. She obviously did a lot of research on the topics in the novel. Great book and look forward to more."
4,Not a house I wish to be in.,"A first book that I have read by her. I normally dont often go astray from the few usual authors that I pretty much only read their works,but while at Borders I wanted something different and after reading this book I was glad I decided to pick it up. A well written story from the first page to the very end,was a hard book to put down. Loved the characters,and was fooled abit thinking that the real Protagonist of the story would be the Antogonist,needless to say I was shocked with the ending of the book. I may check out a few other books of hers."
2,Disappointing,"I'm a huge MHC fan and have read all of her books, but this one was terribly disappointing.All the characters were unlikeable, none more so than the two leads, Peter and Kay. Their relationship was unrealistic and never developed past what seemed to be blind adoration over nothing. The PI everyone kept hiring seemed to pull theories out of thin air and then suddenly they were exactly what actually went down. This book was just totally not believable.A very disappointing effort by MHC."
2,Could have been better edited,"This is the first book I have read by Mary Higgins. I am very fond of suspense novels and was eager to try one of her books. But I was left unsatisfied by the flow of this book.The plot, though straight forward, seemed convoluted for the purpose of audience. The story moves from a first person commentary to third person speech so fast that one needs to make sure to read the next line to realize who the speaker is. The biggest disappointment though was that the novel did not maintain integrity/continuity with the facts mentioned just a few pages earlier. A better proof reading needs to be done before publication.Although I have to admit that the suspense was taut, the above mentioned points kept spoiling my enthusiasm and I just hoped that Mary's next book will be better and crisply edited."
4,I Heard That Song Before,I enjoyed this book a bit more than my last by Mary Higgins Clark. I like a mystery that keeps me guessing and this one certainly did. I never did figure it out until they explain it in the book. The plot line was intriquing and the story moved at a decent pace. A good read.
1,Horribile!!,This book was one of the worst I have ever attempted to read. The characters were flat. The plot was lame. I tried to read it but gave up after the female character married an older man without the author ever describing the romance. There are so many things wrong with this book.... Don't waste your time or money on this one!!!!
1,Might have been a short story,"I have read all of Mary Higgins Clark's mysteries and found this one a huge disappointment. I found it almost totally lacking in the kind of tension and suspense that made her other books page turners. In fact i twice skipped 50 pages just to ""get on with it."" I was curious who the real killer was but that question was raised at the beginning and resolved at the end with very little in between."
3,am I the only slightly bored reader?,"I'm a long time reader of Mary Higgins Clark. I found this novel singularily unengaging, saw it as predictable knew who the ""bad guy"" was early on and continued to read to find out the details."
1,"Boring, No Depth, Easily Forgettable","This book was awful. There was so many characters in the book it was hard to keep up. The book was just one big investigation with a different person being ""interrogated"" in just about every page. There was little on the relationship between the husband and wife. They just off and got married, there was no discussion of their dating and the true bond they supposedly created. Thus, the relationship seemed artificial and stupid. The whole book was just lame, the ending was just disappointing and the characters are easily forgettable. I'll never read it again"
3,DISAPPOINTED,"I HAVE READ MANY MHC BOOKS AND THIS WAS WAS CONFUSING, BORING, WITH NOT MUCH SUSPENSE. OF COURSE, THEY FOUND PETER NOT GUILTY AND HE AND KAY LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER. BAH. MHC HAS BETTER BOOKS OUT THERE."
2,Not Her Best,"MHC tackles the subject of sleepwalking in this one - as well as sundry themes and ideas she has traversed extensively in her earlier books. This one is surprisingly unengaging. I never connected with the heroine at all. On one page, Kay Lansing tells us the cloud of suspicion following mega-rich Peter Carrington, the man she has met once.On the very next page, they get married.Huh?I am wondering if Clark was sleepwalking herself when she wrote this. I knew by page 20 who the bad guy was because she telegraphed it.The plot never really came together, but still I kept reading. Why? because I couldn't quite believe how bad it was.If she was a new writer, Clark wouldn't get past the publishing house's initial slush pile with a book as bizarre and half-baked as this."
5,A Song Worth Hearing,This was an excellent MHC Novel. Peter Carpenter who has been accused of the murdering of his late wife and Susan Althorp and Kay's father. Even though Kay believes her husband to be innocent. Even she has some doubts. This has plenty of suspense and plenty of suspects. You will enjoy getting to the bottom of this mystery. I highly recommended it.
1,very disappointed,"I have read several of MHC's earlier works and have enjoyed each, but this was a very disappointing piece of work! First of all the author switches from past to present tense many times throughout the book even within the same paragraph! Next, the story unfolds in the first person perspective, yet switches to third person unexpectedly in multiple places. Thirdly, the author does a poor job of using antecedents before the pronouns, which makes following the story without rereading nearly impossible! I found this book to be very predictable, with poor character development, notwithstanding the difficulty I found with the constructive errors mentioned above. I found myself constantly comparing this novel with her earlier works, and wondering if MHC had actually written this piece or if she used a ghost writer. Perhaps her editor shares some of the blame!"
4,I am a fan!!!!,"I am a big fan of Mary Higgins Clark. The first section that I visit in the library is where her books are shelved. I am always looking for a new one. I think I have read them all. The nice thing about MHC is that her books are never smutty or improper and she doesn't use strong language, but the stories are still gripping and wonderful. I appreciate that!!! This was a page turner. I was hoping for a happy ending and it didn't disappoint! I am not a big fan of 'first person' dialog though. I prefer to read the novel from a third person point of view, but the story was still good. Different angles of the story really kept you guessing.....yeah, he's guilty...no he's not, yeah, he's guilty, no he's not!!! Kept me on the edge and up reading until I fell asleep with the book in my lap!"
3,Better than the other MHC novels I've read...,"To be truthful, I only ever read MHC's (or her daughter's) novels at my mother's suggestion, and this one was no exception; however, I was a good deal more pleased with this particular novel than I have been with the others I have read by her. I really enjoyed the story line of Kay being the only one who believed her husband was innocent, and that she continued to believe this even when all the odds were against him. This mystery also kept me wondering who the real culprit was a lot longer than any other of the MHC novels I have picked up, which is, of course, a plus. I still believe that Ms. Higgins Clark has a bad habit of overly describing characters who are not that important; however, at least in this novel she did not do so to the extent she usually does!"
4,Page after Page kept my interest,"My close friend knew I was a fan of MHC and gave me this book to read. She insisted that I would truly enjoy it. I have a number of Mary Higgins Clark's novels and I enjoyed most of them. I didn't think this book was one of MHC better stories, but still it was a wonderful read. The descriptions and the personalities of the characters were a bit thin and it would have been nice if the author had included more descriptive characteristics, especially the main character. The plot was interesting and about half way through the book I was antsy trying to digest one clue after another and each time I thought I had discovered the villain. Overall, it was an easy read and there were a few surprises. A good book for the beach."
3,"A light ""read""",I typically listen to the John Patterson genre. This was not as interesting as I expected it to be compared to some other Mary Higgins Clark novels.
2,Boring,"Sorry to say I am not thrilled with MHC's books anymore. Years ago I thought they were riveting. But lately, they characters are very flat and don't develop much at all. I didn't find the characters to be believable at all. It seemed Kay somehow found herself married to accused murderer Peter shortly after meeting him without witnessing how they became close enough for that. I got bored, put down the book to read another, came back for a second try but found I just had no interest."
3,"I Heard That Song Before- or, maybe, I have heard it!","I know that Mary Higgins Clark seems to be fond of using the titles of old standards for book titles, and with no copyright on titles, that is no problem. However, this title is not really a song title. It is strange grammar, since the correct response to the ""same old excuse"" would be to say, ""I've heard that song before!"" And aren't we grateful that Jule Styne knew that when he wrote the song! I keep staring at the book cover on my table and continue to be annoyed at how it makes no sense not to use the present perfect. It's distracting. ""I have"" implies not only the past but the present as well; in other words you're conveying that something is both past and present - hence present perfect."
3,Good but not great....,I seem to be the only writig a review that thinks this way but i just thought the book was ok. I thought it was very predictable and not her best. I have read every one of MHC books and will continue to!
5,Great for Small Kids,"In Brazil I bought a copy of the Portuguese language edition of this book to read to my daughter, so when we moved to the United States it was only natural to seek it out in English. Since she's now seven I don't read out of this Bible to her any more, but from age 3-6 it was great, and I'll read it to my little boy once he's old enough to sit still. We read it cover to cover many times, and I'm convinced that this has helped to to establish a deep familiarity with the fundamental Biblical narrative. Buy it and read it to your kids or grandkids."
3,A good reader for preschoolers.,A good reader for preschoolers. May not be age appropriate for the 4-8 age group as indicated. The child's knowledge is assumed and the some stories aren't explained well. Illustrations are bright and simple - attractive to the young.
3,Nicely illustrated; oversimplified Bible stories,"I find that my young sons pay better attention when I read Bible stories from a book with good illustrations. This book's illustrations are colorful and engaging. But the stories are simplified, sometimes to the point of diminishing the story's intended message."
1,Unacceptable,"The bible is a very complex book written in a language that gives users latitude for interpretation. This book seems to focus on simplifying the language to describe the violence and makes it overly explicit with little focus on the message itself. This book is not for children or for adults - It misses the entire point of the bible. Also, extremely surprised by so many positive reviews."
5,Wonderful young children's Bible,"My children ages 2 and 3 love this!! The pictures are especially toddler friendly and colorful. Beautiful little first Bible and pretty accurate. We just purchased our second because the other was falling apart from so much use. Great way to engage young children in Bible study, and I enjoy reading it too! I highly recommend to everyone."
3,Awesome illustrations!,"I got this for my daughter when she was 2. She's now 3. She LOVES the pictures! She will sit and look at it by herself for 20 minutes at a time, even at the age of 2. However, I'm not crazy about way they tell the stories. I find myself telling her the stories in my own words rather than actually reading it to her. Perhaps when she is 4 and falls into the age group it will seem more appropriate. Currently, when I read it to her as written, I get the ""what???"" look from her. Absolutely fabulous illustrations though!"
3,"Critical, gossipy look at the Wall Street Journal","This book is heavy on the criticism. Page after page, author Francis Dealy goes after the Powers to Be. He throws out comments, slights and insults without any hestiation-- and in some cases without any back-up. the most impressive aspect is that Deally interviewed hudnreds of people, and many of them were willing to be named. Still, the book is disappointing; too many quotes; too many charges, too anti. If Dealy had been more balanced, he might have written a better book."
3,not as stated,i ordered a hypnosis cd to take you to your past lives this is nothing but meditation cd i used to own a past life cd it was great they need to change the name this has nothing to do with past lifes if i could return i would
5,A useful read!,"Understanding the changes that friendships go through is the first step to helping them last. This book helps you to do that. It gives the reasons behind why friends act and say the things they do, and how to handle shifts throughout the course of life. I wished I had read this book sooner-it may have helped me understand my own friendships more.And the advice here may help you to make an educated choice on whether to continue a friendship or end it. A great read and highly recommended."
4,Friendship Takes Work,"Dr. Yager's thoughtful and encouraging book about relationships and their complexity is oblviously the result of important research and an ability to synthesize information and take the step to original thinking. This book is not a rehash of old homilies about making friends and keeping them. It is an examination of our deepest desires and motivations in regard to friendship. It reveals to us the ways in which we can make friendships happen, helps us to understand why friendships fail, and almost certainly makes us better friends. I recommend this book to anyone who has questions about relating to others and hopes to enrich their lives and their friends' lives."
5,Very Comfortable,I like to wear slippers in the house and have a difficult time finding ones that retain their cushioned feeling. These meet those expectations and more! They also wash well!
3,Runs large,Nice slippers but not really the quality expected..much too large but pretty comfortable. I would size down for proper fit.
5,Wonnnderful!,"These are the best slippers ever. I should know as I'm always in search of something comfortable to wear on my feet since gravity has taken over my body. These slippers are soft, the foam is fantastic and can make any sore feet feel better. After putting them on it is almost impossible to resist saying, ""Ahhhh!"" They hold up quite well even after numerous washings. My first pair is well over 2 years old and still going strong. Remarkable since I have worn them every day for the entire two years except when they are drying from being washed. I'm only buying another pair for a change of color. You can't go wrong with a pair of these slippers."
2,Not as good as they used to be,"I bought a pair of these several years ago and they have been the most comfortable slippers I've ever owned. I wear them all the time and only just now are they starting to fall apart, still as comfy as ever but the material has split open. I ordered a pair to replace them, same style, same size, and they are made differently now! The toe separator has moved further down on the slipper making it less comfortable. The strap laying over the foot is much tighter and the top edge of the strap is digging into the tops of my feet which is painful. They also have a funny smell to them and look and feel as if they are made more cheaply. For example, the seams do not look or feel as well put together. Even the foot padding, which was my favorite thing about my old pair, isn't as comfy and fluffy as before. I am quite disappointed and wish I would've tried these on in a store before buying online."
5,Great Slippers!!!!,These are great slippers that are worth the buy. They are very comfortable. These were the fourth pair and all are great.
3,"even though wide, still very tight","I can go in Payless and buy their wides and they fit fine, but to buy the slippers in wide, they are still very tight. I will try to stretch them by wearing them, and see if I can make they fit."
3,okay,These feel good. They do not have good support though. The white color also stains very fast. Not worth the money.
5,Extremely Comfort,I love these slippers! I wear them and throw them in the washer when they get dirty. I have given them to all my friends and family members as gifts. My daughter asked for another pair for Christmas. I gave my daughter-in-law a pair when she waspregnant and she was so pleased with them she started giving them to her pregnant friends as a shower gift. I keep a pair packed in my travel bag. I hope they never stop making them.
5,Love them!,I love these slippers! They are perfect for someone that lives in a warm climate like AZ. Great for around the house and even outside. I want more!
2,Not it.,"I was excited to get these, only to be disappointed.They were soft, but they were too tight around my toes. I wear a size 6.5 or 7 and got the size within the higher bracket, but still too small. I returned them."
3,Slippers,"Very comfy, would probably be more comfortable if I wasn't pregnant and had extra weight bearing down on my feet."
5,Love...,"When I first put on thought they were too tight on my foot, but after wearing for the second time they felt a lot better. They do stretch out and form to you foot and now are my favorite. I love to put them on right after I shower!"
2,I would have liked them if....,"I was so wanting these slippers to work for me but when I tried them on the first thing I noticed was pain between my toes on both feet. I wear a women's size 8 so I got the medium and the length was perfect but they seemed a little tight across the foot, even though I wear a B width. I would expect them to loosen up with wear however they would still hurt between the toes.If Acorn would put a little padding in the thong that goes between the toes I think it would make a big difference but there is only what feels like a hard cord with a very thin terry cloth covering it.I will give them 2 stars because the padding on the bottom felt good and soft and they look nice.Too bad. I will now try the Acorn slippers that wrap around the foot."
5,Soooooo Comfortable!,These are super comfortable slippers. I have had several foot surgeries and am not allowed to walk around my house barefoot. I bought two pairs of these slippers and I live in them while at home. I have put one pair in the washer and dryer with good results.
5,Absolutely wonderful!,"These are the best house shoes I have had in my life! They are like walking on marshmellows. Except without the stickiness, of course. ;) I love them, they feel so wonderful when I come home from work and then have to stand in the kitchen cooking and cleaning. Totally delighted with them."
5,Oh so comfortable!,"This is the most comfortable slipper I've purchased in a long time. It's soft and well cushioned yet, because it's open, your foot doesn't sweat as it does in closed slippers. I followed their sizing chart and recommendation and the fit was perfect. I would purchase this slipper again."
2,"Disappointed: Cute, but not comfortable","I loved the way these looked when I ordered them. I wear a 7.5 and ordered the 8-9M. The length is perfect. However, as other reviewers have mentioned the band across the width of the foot is tight and thong portion is uncomfortable. I would return these shoes but don't have the energy to deal with packing them up and shipping them, so I am keeping them. I am hoping that they will loosen up. Be warned, unless you have a narrow foot, the band across and thong portion of this slipper are likely to be uncomfortable."
4,Great slipper but sizing not right!,"Go ahead and order this slipper; it is extremely comfy and well mail. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that it runs large. I'm a size eight, and the 6.5-7.5 M just fits. I took this tip from one of the previous reviewers."
2,Not worth the money,"I was NOT impressed with the Acorn Spa Thongs. The ""memory foam"" is very hard and does not ""give"" with wear. The material rubs the bottom of my feet making them sore. The price is way too high for the product. I would definitely not recommend this product to a friend, or anyone else for that matter. Will not purchase again. I had a pair of memory foam thongs that I bought at WalMart for $11.00 made by Spa Sensations. These were like walking on a cloud. Unfortunately, they came apart when washed and I could not find them in my size at Walmart again, they were sold out, or at all online. So, I decided to give the Acorn thongs a try at 3 times the cost. Just a waste of money. I'm still wearing the coming apart ones I bought at Walmart."
3,Truly soft,"Slippers are the most cushiony slippers. I'm sorta glad I got the same size as my shoe, size 8, but it is a tad long. If I went smaller to actually fit the length of my foot, the height of the instep would have been impossibly tight. As it is with the longer foot bed, it's still tighter than I'm used to in a slipper. NO arch support that I feel - I have high arches with plantar fasciitis. This slipper meets the requirement of not going barefoot but doesn't help my arch."
3,Stretch out too much,"I really wanted to like these, especially at this price. They came and felt very tight, but I knew they would stretch some. Well, they really have. I ordered a M (I am a 7.5 size) and in a few weeks, they are not probably at an 8. Also, my foot shifts in them so that it hangs over the edge and I often trip ... I bought them because I wear flip flops all yearlong in the house and I wanted some warmth and also some safety because of the sole. I got the warmth, but the safety is not there - I slip in them all the time!"
2,Can't wear them,The left foot is too tight and constricts my big toe. I can't wear them! I tried using a shoe stretcher but this didn't work.
3,like them but...,"They just aren't as wonderful as I expected for the price. I expected to feel like I was walking on clouds and these aren't quite there. Also, I expected more of a ""memory foam"" experience meaning molding to my foot but that hasn't really happened. Even so, I like that they're washable. Mine have been through the washer and dryer multiple (3?) times with no problems so far. They are comfy...just not over-the-top comfy. Also, one of the main reasons I got them is because my feet get too hot in fuzzy slippers, especially in the summer. My feet get hot in these too!"
5,Like walking on clouds,These flip flop slippers are so comfortable. My pregnant feet are achy sometimes and when I put these on it helps alleviate the achiness. So soft and comfy--I LOVE these!
5,So comfy!,"I really like these slippers! I'm one of those people who live in flip-flops, but I want to wear slippers around the house - this is the best of both worlds. These slippers are very well padded on the sole (not thin, like so many slippers) and the furry material is very comfy.If you're in between sizes, I'd recommend sizing down. I normally wear a 9 1/2, and the 9 was perfect for me."
4,Nice but too expensive,"I had been looking for thong slippers FOREVER and could not find them. I finally found these, and although they were a bit pricey I decided to get them because the reviews were so good and I hadn't been able to find anything else. They are very comfortable and exactly what I was looking for. However, I have the ""natural"" color, and even when washed they do not come out looking clean. I also think they are horribly overpriced. Just a week or so after I bought them I found thong slippers in Target for $7. They are just as comfy as the Acorn's, though they are more ""fuzzy"". If you don't mind spending the money, these are good slippers. But I would not pay this price again."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE,"Read the reviews and had high expectations which were met! I am addicted to these and wear them 99% of the time I am at home. In fact, I was so addicted that I didn't put them in the washer for a long time, just because I couldn't stand the thought of giving them up for a few hours to launder. But once I did wash/air dry them they turned out great. Didn't have many color choices for a low price, so got the lime green...but think they're fine in any color.They do leave a slight indentation mark on the top of my foot but I don't care. I literally cannot wait to put them on every morning when I get up out of bed and then again when I get home from work."
5,MOST COMFORTABLE SLIPPERS EVER!!,"I absolutely love these spa sandals. You feel like you're walking on clouds, but also provides very nice arch support. I wish I could find shoes that were as comfortable as these slippers. I sprained my ankle recently and strange enough, the only time my ankle did not hurt was when I wore these sandals/slippers. I also tend to suffer from foot pain due to my weight and again, the only time my feet don't hurt is when I wear these slippers. Its my first time purchasing an Acorn product and I'll definitely be back for more. If I could give it more than 5 starts, I would."
3,too big,the sizing on this product is a little big in length. if you have a low arch you may want to consider the size down. I have a high arch and the product fits in the band going over the foot but not in lenrth. it is about an inch too long in front and back of the foot. there is also a embroidered seal on the heal that rubs the bottom of the foot and rubs the bottom of the foot. but the slipper is comfortable to stand on for extended periods.
2,Way too tight.,"I looked at several review in purchasing these slippers and saw only 1 bad review. Well, here is another one. Sorry, but the thong on these slippers are way too short. This slipper will need to go back."
5,The best new band in years,"I saw these guys at a recent concert and they were amazing! They are unique and yet remeniscent of several of the best ""old school"" bands like Sting, U2 and others.They put on a great show. They are truly talented musicians and have a fun show. The album is excellent and I recommend it strongly.Don't Download it! Buy it. . .Drue"
1,this is mis-leading,Understand this is the Deck Only This sucked expecting what the picture shows. WATCH OUT!!!!
5,Awesome,I've been using this cologne for 10+ years. It is still my favorite. I highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't tried it.
4,"Great Fragrance, Great Find...","I am new to the Polo Blue Cologne line and I really like it! I haven't received any compliments yet. However, at 65 I have noticed a lot of the gals like to be close to me lately. The cologne arrivedfrom the seller as promised. Packaged well to prevent leakage and damage."
3,Bumble and Bumble styling creme,"This product is light and does not weigh down your hair or make it ""crunchy."" I would rate the hold factor as fair. This is more than I normally pay for a hair product and was expecting a little more performance from it. I think you need a lot more than the suggested amount to get results. I do love the smell."
4,"keeps its hold, thickens the follicle","The styling creme gets 4 stars because it is not easy to predict if you can manage the styling with dry or wet hair. My experience has been favorable with adding it to towel dried hair and then scrunching the ends, if you want that effect, while blow-drying. It also works well if you use a styling brush while blow-drying. If you want the wet look, this cream is good, but may be too heavy for thin hair. A little goes a long way!"
2,"It's better than nothing, but I don't love the formula change","This used to be a miracle worker. I don't really use much hair product because my laziness far outweighs my desire to look presentable. The old formula was light but still super effective and took a whopping 2 seconds to force my hair into submission. The new(ish) formula is so light that I'm convinced, much like the emperor's new clothes, it only works if you believe in it. It's inspiring me to sell empty bottles to people and tell them it's a new super lightweight formula called ""Nuthing"" (you have to spell it that way otherwise no one will believe you). I won't be reordering this styling cream...I mean CREME."
1,Been using since 1998 - but no more...,"I've been using this product since 1998, but have stopped. The new formula just doesn't cut it. I have very fine hair and this doesn't provide anything like the hold it used to."
1,AWFUL,I have tried many hair styling products---both expensive and cheap and this product has to be one of the WORST products I've ever used!Frizzy dried hair----that's what I get when I use this 'creme'...and my hair is healthy...and this product still manages to make it look like I stuck my finger in a socket!!
5,Love the product!,"I've used this product for several years now, I wish they hadn't changed the fomula but the new stuff works ok! It works well for giving your hair body and helps hold the style well."
2,Thinner than Before,"I've used this many times before, but purchased it in a store. This is thinner than the original version. I don't have an explanation for the change."
2,Not great- many other better choices for less,"I bought this product about a month ago after reading about it in a few magazines as a wonder product. The marketing buzz was the wonder, not the product. It leaves my hair feeling 'crisp' rather than soft even when I blow dry. My stylist recently recommended Moroccan Oil and used it before a blow-out. Loved the way my hair looked and felt after that product. I'd recommend it or a few other cheaper products over this one. Feels gloppy out of the bottle and stiff on the hair. Too bad I wasted $20 on it."
5,This product is great! Bumble and Bumble Styling Lotion,This lotion is great when I want to blow dry straight or let air dry curly. My hair looks good and not frizzy.
1,"the cream in the bottle is NOT B&B Styling Creme...wrong color, wrong texture",I have been using this styling creme for years and love it. But the product in this bottle is not the same color or texture as it should be. B&B; is expensive and worth the $$$ BUTthis is definitely not what is in this bottle.
3,Functional but not the best,"I bought this after watching the videos on Bumble & Bumble's website, and I do not think that it is worth so much money. It has the texture of a runny gel and only gives moderate hold (but the hold has great memory). It smells like tall grass and plastic (not pleasant in my opinion). I can brush my hair after using this and have both hold/memory and volume without flakes, BUT even though my hair still looks natural, it feels like it's coated with something synthetic and very lightly sticky. Before brushing my hair it has a fair bit of crunch to it for sure. I could see this being handy only for certain looks, but not for everyday - ergo, not worth the money in my case. Should have bought the 2oz version (or just something else)."
5,great for fine hair,I have very fine locks and this is the perfect product. It gives my hair volume and hold without looking greasy or weighing it down. Holds styles all day (I work looonng hours) but hair is still touchable. It smells nice too!
5,Bumble and Bumble Styling Creme,"I love Bumble and Bumble Styling Creme! My hair is thick and difficult to control, but the Styling Creme makes styling my hair a breeze. I'm so glad that I discovered the product, and I've been recommending it to friends as well as my hair dresser."
1,What did I buy?!,I have thick shoulder-length hair. The first time I used this product I used about a tablespoon total - and noticed NO difference at all. I tried again and used more. Still no difference. Maybe this is better for fine hair? And my thick hair just weighs is down?
2,Not what it used to be,"I used to buy this product religiously until mysteriously the formula changed about a year ago. For some reason, it doesn't have the hold that it used to. The package didn't change at all, but it seems so different now. I have shoulder-length layered wavy hair and like to have soft hold that's not crunchy and that can stay all day. This won't do that anymore."
2,hmmm...,"this was my first time buying B and B products from anywhere but B and B and I won't do it again....it works ok to hold the curl in my hair which is why I gave it 2 stars, but not as well or for as long as the bottle of styling creme I bought directly from B and B... The creme itself has a different texture as well, hard to describe except to say when you I look at the cremes side by side it has a look and feel of conditioner rather than the B and B direct styling creme which is slightly more tacky and gelatinous....the bottles themselves are different too (both in text and design)."
1,alternative to bumble,"HEY EVERYONE, I KNOW IT SUCKS THAT BUMBLE REFORMULATED THEIR USED TO BE AWESOME STYLING CREME BUT I FOUND A GREAT ALTERNATIVE! The brand is called Arrojo. it's their stlying creme. check it out!"
2,Less than mediocre,"I generally really like Bumble and Bumble product. I thought this would be the grooming creme with a little extra hold--it is NOT. While also a creme, this one is stickier and actually holds up less on my short, textured (male) hair. I do not like/recommend this product. In fact, I just saw it at a retail store for $6 (YES, SIX) and passed on it."
2,Old Formula at Big Lots,"I bought the old formula from Big Lots for $6. I'm still playing around with it, but so far it hasn't impressed me. My hair is thick, 4c and loves creamy stylers. This isn't doing it for me."
1,Hate it,"Made my medium-thick wavy hair very dry and almost crunchy. Also, did not help with frizz- actually made it worse. Very disappointed. Definitely won't use again."
5,Love this styling creme,A great styling cream...it doesn't weigh my hair down but provides a good medium for styling and also minimizes frizz.
1,They changed the formulation. It SUCKS.,"I've used bumble and bumble's Styling Creme for eight years, and it was the best product ever. In early 2007 they changed the formulation, and now it does absolutely nothing. No hold, no added texture. It feels like the original product when your hair is wet, but once it's dried, it feels like you have nothing on your hair...and I don't mean that in a good way.I've compared the new bottle with the old, and the ingredients are dramatically changed. The list of ingredients is also much shorter.Anyway, I requested a refund, and bumble and bumble sent me a prepaid envelope to send the product back. In fact, I just received my refund today, so at least they're honest. But I hope enough people tell them how their product sucks so they go back to the old formulation."
1,they changed it for the worse,"I could kill them. They changed the ingredients and didn't change the packaging, so now I'm stuck making a trip to UPS to return what I bought. If you've used this product in the past, you'll find that it's completely different now and pretty useless. Isn't there a law against changing your product but not telling the consumer on the bottle that it's ""new""?"
1,Polaris is right - New is Not Better,"Got a bottle myself and this stuff is really useless. It's totally weightless going on, which means you better have some pretty fine hair to really make it feel manageable. When it dries it provides a minimal amount of control, but firm hold it definitely isn't."
3,Very interesting companion to movie,"I picked this one up on a gamble (reduced price) and read it pretty quickly. I was surprised at how well it was done (although the writer made the Aliens and their technology a bit too organic to suit me). I can't think of just what I'd change but felt that some spots needed something. I do really appreciate the continuation of the story, if a sequel is ever made to the movie this is the only practical type of story to do."
4,Fun for adults,"I don't have kids of my own, but when I heard the controversy around the Sesame Beginnings (you know, how some doctors believe kids under 2 should not be exposed to TV), I wandered into a local store and picked up a copy of this title. When I was a kid I was totally crazy about the Sesame Street gang. Anyway, this is a really fun DVD to watch, esp. when you're cooking or just plain bored with life. The music is upbeat and it really makes you feel good about life. And the baby muppets are so cute! I think, with the adults' approval, I'll get this and other Sesame Beginnings titles as baby shower gifts in the future."
2,Not for me,"My son didn't care too much for it & the high pitched, squeaky voices were too much for me."
3,"NOT AS GOOD AS ""BEGINNING TOGETHER""","After my daughter fell in love with ""Beginning Together"", I decided to purchase another DVD in the series--""Make Music Together"". However, this one came up flat when compared to ""Beginning Together"".After reading that ""Make Music Together"" features Wayne Brady and his daughter, I anticipated a lively and humorous performance, but Wayne's interaction with his daughter was flat. She was a shy and nonresponsive young girl--which is OK in the real world, but made for a bad DVD.""Beginning Together"" featured singer, Brandy and her daughter. They interacted well together, and her daughter was very outgoing and laughed alot, and loved the Sesame Street characters. Aside from the muppets' singing, this made the DVD entertaining.Wayne's interaction with his daughter fell short and made the DVD less enjoyable than ""Beginning Together"". If you don't have ""Beginning Together"", get it instead of this one."
2,Disappointed...,I was excited to buy this DVD because I like Sesame Street's educational philosophy. I was disappointed because the songs weren't very engaging and the dialog was worse. My nine month old loves Signing Time and Baby Einstein and good music in general and wasn't at all interested in the Make Music Together DVD. I didn't enjoy it either.
5,Still enjoying it,"My 21 month old is still enjoying this DVD after a year. Also, I like that the scenes with the parents motivate you to watch and play with your child. This DVD is not like other DVD's that you just plop down in front of the TV to watch. The songs are catchy and very interactive. We especially like ""Bump Baby"", ""Ma-ma-mama"", and ""Twinkle Twinkle."" My child doesn't like the regular Sesame Street DVD's and we haven't tried watching any other Sesame Beginnings DVD's because she's so happy with this one. I would definitely recommend this. My child's other favorite DVD's are ""Swingset Mamas"", ""Baby Moves"", ""Letter Factory"", and all the ""Signing Times"" DVD's."
4,Beginnings - Good DVD Overall,"The DVD is only about 5 songs long. All the songs have motions that are interactive with the kids. I only gave it four stars because two of the songs are about taking naps (which I did not think fit in an active video). Also the narrator gets a little preachy. I could have done without the lecture on how music and songs help children learn, etc. It just did not fit. That said, my 16 month old likes the songs and dances along."
5,Great for kids who love to dance,"This is my 23-month-old's absolute favorite movie. He anticipates each scene and even tries to play along on our piano (well, bang along anyway). He bounces and dances with the characters. Definitely worth buying - we could play it every day and he'd still adore it."
2,Boring,"This video was very boring compared to the ""Elmo's World"" videos that my son loves. I guess if you are looking for something low key and relaxing for a baby to watch it is a good choice. It is not good for a baby who really loves fun music and action. My son was 10 months old when I played it and he wasn't interested at all and neither was I. The song choices were dissapointing. It was tedious to sit through, but luckily at only 30 minutes long it was almost over before it started."
1,Needs some pictures,"This book might be packed with information about the various paddling techniques but takes at least three readings to understand what the author is trying to describe. The narrative would be helped tremendously if some pictures were included. Simple things like showing the proper wrist rotatation during strokes, even body positioning during the stroke are not illustrated.In addtion, the authors writing style leaves a lot to be desired. The author wants to imagine he is right next to us while we sit in the kayak. Things like, '...go ahead and pick up your kayak while we walk down this hill together....' UGH!!!!Just describe each technique and some illustrations to go with each step would do wonders for this book.As a novice to kayaking I can't recommend this book"
2,Lacks discriptive diagrams and photo's,"I agree with Mark-from-DC; there is WAY to much verbage and WAY too few diagrams. Verbose ""how-to"" passages must be read several times to get the gist of what the author is trying to describe. I actually ended up diagramming my own sketches as I re-read sections. I too, would not recommend this book, and for the same reasons. I found it a big disappointment."
3,Sea Kayaking primarily,"I would have given this more stars had I wanted a book that was primarily about sea kayaking. I was looking for a book that would tallk about streams, rivers, and lakes too. Good for sea kayaking, not good for the gamut."
4,"Good Book, even better price!",This was a gift for my fiance's aunt and uncle who recently started kayaking. It is full of basic info to help you get more comfortable with the great activity of kayaking. I would recommend it to anyone!
1,Not good,"I attended a lecture of Mr. McCauley at the London School of Economics (fancy name but rotting buildings). He really has no understanding of the country I was born in , the Soviet Union, or Russia today . I made the error of believing he might know more about Afghanistan. I was wrong"
5,Who knew??,"LOVE her honesty. You GO girl! A really fun read. Honest about the ups and downs, not only about her career, but about the love for her son and the hard choices she had to make in life that kept them apart sometimes..."
3,"Good, but read almost like a resume of her work","I love the Golden Girls and as such, picked up this book to read more about Rue. The book was really informative, but at times I would skip over paragraphs that were basically just detailing who she played in what play and with what other actors. Maybe if I knew more of the names she was dropping I would've enjoyed those parts more, but I wanted to hear more about her LIFE than the plays she was in.Also, she finally talks about the Golden Girls near the very end of the book, and she did have some less-than-flattering things to say about the actresses that played Dorothy and Sophia. I felt it was a little crass to talk about the actresses that way.All in all, you will learn a lot about Rue McClanahan from reading this book."
5,From the lips of Blanche!,"Ms. McClannahan has written a terrific book, and I couldn't help but think of her character from the Golden Girls many times while reading it. This is a very witty, fun, emotional rollcoasteresque novel which I finished in just a few days of receiving it as a gift. I found myself both laughing out loud one moment, and with tears in my eyes the next. My admiration for her has increased 10 fold, and I only wish there were more professional actors like her nowadays. 3 Cheers for Rue McClannahan!!!"
5,So much to love!,"As someone who is 21 years old, I'm sure a lot of people are wondering why I'd be interested this book, but I absolutely adore Rue McClanahan and always have since I was little girl watching Golden Girls. This was a wonderful book. I enjoyed hearing about all of her experiences and revelations. She has a brilliant writing style and as someone mentioned before it is definitely like listening to great girl talk from one of your girlfriends! This was such a fun read and I'm sad I finished it in two days. I wish there was more to read!!! It deserves more than 5 stars. Thanks Rue for making me laugh for the past 18 years of my life!"
5,Fabulous and fun,A great story of Rue's ups and downs in love and trying to make it as an actress. She is so funny- you will laugh out loud!
2,The sad story of a self-centered woman,"For years, I was a fan of Rue McClanahan in her role of ""Blanche"" on the Golden Girls and really, I hate to speak ill of anyone that has passed on but my goodness this was one self-centered woman. She hardly raised her son, instead pawning him off on her mother and God knows who else. She asked her therapist to loan her money (boundaries?). She chose to work instead of visiting her dying mother and not making it there before she did. Her lack of commitment to marriage depressed me. Sure, she was successful...if you define success as becoming rich and famous. But if you value family at all you might find it difficult to like this woman after reading this book. It definitely changed my perception of her and dare I say, lost my respect?"
1,I dont believe anything she wrote.,"I love Rue. However, after page eight when she remembers what happened to her when she was only ten months old I don't believe any other part of her story is true either. Who can remember when they were ten months old?? Not sure I will waste my time finishing the book."
2,"Mediocre DVD, Mediocre Films","This release is the kind that you would find in the 1.99 or less bin at Media Play. The picture and audio quality is poor, and the films themselves aren't the cream of the crop when it comes to kaiju movies. ""Gappa the Triphibian Monster"" is a laughably bad movie, but I recommend buying the Media BLasters release instead. It has the original Japanese audio and the dubbed version, while also being of a better picture quality. The Gamera films are not as fun to laugh at, but rather just annoying. They are, however, great for the younger kaiju fans. These releases are in horrible condition, as the print is very grainy. So to be blunt, the films are bad and the DVD's are bad. I suggest that if the buyer wants some better, more serious kaiju movies they check out the Godzilla movies from the 50's and 60's as well as the newer ones, which have great special effects and much better acting than this trash."
3,Mystery boxed set!!!,"This box set is mysterious, because Amazon and several other dealers listed it as ""out of print"" before it was ever made available. You cannot order it, but it does show up in bargain bins. I believe, and this is just my theory, that a legal problem arose over the inclusion of The Sandy Frank owned versions of Gamera Vs. Gaos and Gamera Vs. Zigra. The earlier, and superior, version of Gamera vs. Gaos called ""Return of the Giant Monsters"" is apparently in the public domain, but Gamera vs. Zigra was only ever distributed in the US by Sandy Frank. If anyone out there knows the story behind this box set. Please comment."
5,Century Optics .55x Wide Angle Adapter on Cannon HV20,No edge distortion. Good adapter. Single step down ring available for the HV20 to keep it close in.
3,Not What I Expected,"Southern Soldier Boy is a wonderful collection of authentic tunes from the time of the War Between the States. However, I was somewhat disappointed in that three quarters of the songs are purely instrumental. I expected to hear stories accompanied by music, but vocals are in short supply on this CD."
3,Too weak connections,A bit disappointing. Too many digressions. The connections between Zoroastrianism and later currents that MIGHT possibly have been influenced by it are just too weak. Scientifically it is on the speculative side. But it gets better towards the end.
5,A great cleaning guide!,"Okay, I'm not one to read, pick up or collect books, but this is a must have for anyone who likes a clean home.These two Brits give simple ways of making cleaning easier and fun, plus there are many tips on making cleaning products from common household items that really work.I have to say that one of my favorite shows on right now is ""How Clean is Your House"" on BBC America. Kim and Aggie are fun to watch clean really dirty houses.Alright I admit it, I'm a clean freak and this is my bible, but buy it and I guarantee this will help you keep your house clean."
4,"Great info, too noisy design","I liked the information that this book has. Very useful advices on how to keep your house clean using simple handy products such as baking soda, ice cubes, even banana peel.The design of the book, however, is not that ""clean"", but very noisy. This makes it hard to read - white font on pink page (p.55), white on dark yellow (p.58), white on brighter yellow (pp.62-63), white on colorful photo (p.150). To make a long story short - I would really like the designer of the book to be less creative. May be the book would look more formal, but much easier to read. Something to think about when/if the book is going to be reprinted!"
4,cleaning tips,"Wonder for anyone to own. Especially if you want to save money or to use harmless cleaning items you find in your house without having to use alot of money, and keep the enviroment safe."
2,Yes to Kim & Aggie,"I have mixed feelings about this book. I bought this book after watching their BBC show ""How Clean is Your House."" I will be honest and say that the notes I took while watching the show were more helpful than this book. In other words, I learned more by watching than by reading this book.The newest season is not as good as previous seasons as it seems they are using more --- modern --- cleaning ""tools."" Its very discouraging as they have some great home-made concoctions that are made from some very basic ingredients (laundry detergent, vinegar, lemons, tea tree oil, etc.)If you are a fan of the show I would say you could hold off buying this book. If you have never heard of Kim and Aggie before I say this book might give you some new inspiration - to clean. :D"
5,How much happier a clean house makes you.,"Kim and Aggie change lives- If you have never seen the TV show, these women go into homes that should rightfully be condemned, clean them from top to bottom, and return them to the owners with stern warnings to ""keep it clean"". The book is an extension of this fantastic show that literally transforms people's lives. One can easily underestimate how much cleanliness and order contributes to a happy life. This book is a great guide to achieving and maintaining such order. The cleaning tips and methods are smart and easy and the cleaning solutions they use made from borax, salt, vinegar, baking soda, lemon to name a few are ""cheap and cheerful"". Cleaning made fun."
4,"Hip, Funny and Helpful","Gotta love these two old British biddies with their ""Oh my gawds"" style of speaking. Their show is grand and the book is not bad. One of my peeves is on the show they use the term ""biological powder"" but never tell you what that is. A friend says it's ""Fab"" but that's just detergent, right? The girls don't mention what biological powder is in their book nor own their website. This is frustrating. Other than that, it's a good romp about how to clean your house - start in the bedroom first! - and move to the front (or bottom) of the house. Super advice. Good writing. Nice presentation. Lots of colorful photos."
3,Good little tips but light on details,This book is for those that love to clean and perhaps are clean freaks like me. I loved some of the little tips inside but wished there was a bit more to the book. It was more for those who have let their homes fall into utter disrepair.
5,"Healthy, Helpful Hints","The television show by the same name was my guilty pleasure. It doesn't appear on any of my stations anymore so I had to get my ""fix"" by buying this book. I'm glad I did because all those cleaning solutions the gals showed being used on their show are now at my fingertips. I appreciate any cleaning aids that are non-toxic and readily available (and it helps if they're already in my pantry). This book is a helpful, as well as enjoyable, guide to keeping a home clean and healthy. The less chemicals we can introduce into our enclosed environment, the better. These gals make it easy to keep your home clean and much less toxic."
5,Very Helpful,"This book is so great for giving you solution for cleaning. I have had problems with pet stains, but no more."
3,An OK buy,I can't fault this book but I can't say I love it either. It has all the tips you need from the tv show but it just hasn't inspired me like the programs did. It would benefit from before and after pictures or something to make a person want to pick up the duster. It is a useful source of information on how to keep you home hygienic but thats about it.
2,Not as shown,"What I received contained only the piston and cylinder. It did not contain the resevoir and hose as shown. I requested a replacement, was told it was on backorder, so I held on to the first one just in case. I received the replacement identical to the first about a month later, still missing the resevoir. I'm keeping one and just returned the other as it's still a competitive price. My main complaint is that I didn't get what was shown."
3,Disapointing - and not terribly informative,"Donald's book ""Lincoln"" is incredible. So maybe I was unfairly expecting too much.But I didn't learn much from this book. He makes the point that Lincoln did not have any very close friends and therefore there was no one that could truly speak of what Lincoln was thinking.Much of this book discusses the relationship Lincoln had with each of the people involved. And it then talks some (not a lot) about that those people wrote or said.But to me, Lincoln did not come out of what was said. I didn't find myself seeing anything new.Get his book ""Lincoln"" instead."
3,Some value,"Two weeks after reading it I can barely remember any of the friends descriptions or characteristics. Of course the point of reading it was to learn more about Lincoln, and I did that—such things as how friendless he felt during most of his life. It felt a little bit like a secondary or tertiary reference, about which the professor said ""If you have time, you might want to read this."""
3,Interesting read but disappointment overall,"The book was easy to read and not very lengthy, but I got the sense the writer wanted to focus more on Lincoln's bedroom habits (Is he gay or not?) rather than anything else. We learn very little about his relationship with his wife. Maybe the reason for this is Abe Lincoln's friends rarely got along with Mary Todd Lincoln, and book is told through the eyes and experiences of Abe's friends or former law partners. Lastly, I felt the writer didn't tell us enough about Lincoln's children. Why was Abe's relationship with his eldest son so horrible? Was Abe never around when the kids were being raised or did he not show any interest in the boys? Some clear explanation would be helpful. In short, the book is interesting but a disappointment when all is said and done."
2,Adjustable Desk Lamp- Steel,I like the features of it. But it is top heavy and if you are not careful the arm will swing down. I like the fact you can adjust the bightness of the light however I have to leave on the low setting otherwise the light flickers and then goes out.
3,"Works fine, but dangerous",I have had this desk lamp for years and it operates fine. Too bad I have burned myself several times because the top near the handle gets extremely hot.
2,Barely Legal,"This collection is a disappointment. The overall quality is poor; the come on of the ""big names"" is a farce. Two pages taken almost at random and out of context from John Grisham's ""The Partner"" do not constitute a ""legal thriller."" An incident (not even a courtroom incident) from Scott Turow's ""Pleading Guilty"" is almost meaningless without background on the characters.Irwin Shaw and Louis Auchincloss had good selections, probably because both have excellent reputations as short story writers. ""Speedball"" by Brian Hedge was excellent, but it had everything to do with the death of John Belushi and nothing to do with lawyers, court, and legal matters.I am a fan of courtroom drama, and ""Legal Thrillers"" did not provide me with even one clever lawyer. This book seems hastily put together and lacked focus.-sweetmolly-Amazon.com Reviewer"
5,Love it!,Best moisturizer I have used that has kept my skin from being really dry and helped keep my breakouts under control.
4,satisfactory,"moisturizing & fragrance are meet my expected. I am using the product now, and expect its moisture in the coming dry Spring season."
2,Too oily,"I brought this as a last resort because I was waiting for an oil free moisturizer in the mail.This stuff is just way too oily. It claims to be oil free yet it just sits on your face & doesn't moisturizer & just makes my combo skin have that SHINY effect that I hate. & my cheeks would flake ...so it's too oily AND not moisturizing enough? mehh idkk...since I brought it I thought I may as well just use it all & I did & I guess I have to admit it got better over time but I'll stick to African black soap ...it's literally an ALL in one cleanser,toner,moisturizer! Amazing...this stuff is a dud -__- not for me (acne/oily/dry skin)"
2,A little too geasy and the pump got to be improved,"My husband is able to find a suitable moisturizing cream for his eczema condition from Aveeno, so it leads me wanting to find a facial moisturizer for myself.After reading a few Aveeno product review, I picked Clear Complexion, hoping it is non-oily and will improve my occassional acne problems as well.This is my review after 1 week of trial. I have combination skin (mainly oily around the T-zone area) staying in a topical country. It is a little too oily for me, and the pump size is a little too big, each pump is way too much for my face and I practically have to apply the excess onto my husband.I haven't yet to see obvious improvement on my complexion yet, but I'm still hoping it will show me some results. It is a little too oily for day use, perhaps I will continue to use it as night cream. I think I have to keep my product search going again."
1,did not work for me,"I purchased Aveeno Clear Complexion (no fragnance, natural...) I thought I made a good choice, but I was so mad- my face started to get worse and worse- meaning more pimples. I did not wanted to throw away the products (mousterizer plus cleaning solutions), so I used the whole bottles, but all the time I was using it- I can say that product did not help at all, made it just worse every week... I was very unhappy with the results- my skin did definetly not like itI switched to Neutrogena Advanced Solution (pack of 3 procucts) not only it costed me less, but works great for me."
3,Okay- nothing great,"Great moisturizer, but caused me to break out. had to stop using it. I think that Neutrogena is a better product."
5,Rad,"I love all of Aveeno's products. I have very sensitive skin and Aveeno is the only brand whose products - from shaving cream to moisturizer - have never caused my skin any irritation. Ever.This moisturizer is a little bit pricey compared to other drug store brands but it's the best thing I've ever bought for my face, hands down. About four days ago my face was extremely red and splotchy and I had a lot of pimples on my cheeks and around my mouth. But within a few days of using this my face immediately began to clear up, and now the splotchy redness is nearly gone. The other small dots of ""problem areas"" that I still have I use a different drug store topical acne cream, but the irritating feeling and the bumpiness have disappeared. My skin looks good again.It's just awesome. It's a moisturizer, sunblock, and blemish clearer-uper/preventer all in one. Totally sweet."
5,Perfect Cream for the Young,This is the best face cream I've tried and I've tried a lot!! I've been using this one for about two years now and will never try anything else. I'm only in my early twenties and my skin gets really dry in the colder months so this is perfect. It's thick without being heavy or oily. All other creams I tried were either heavy and oily or so light that I had to reapply in an hour or two. I put this on in the morning and before bed and my skin looks and feels great. It's also nice because it's geared more towards the younger demographic. So many creams now are anti-wrinkle or age reverse or anti-aging that it seems these companies forgot some of us just get dry skin. I love this product and recommend it to all my friends!
5,Awesome!,"a friend had given me a small sample of this before, and I could never find it in stores, found it here on Amazon, and it came in shorter time than expected and it's great! I use it every morning after i've cleaned my face and skin has cleared up, and is much more toned"
2,Beautiful but nearly impossible to watch,"Such a shame, this BluRay is full of beautiful high-res images that are paraded before you at such a speed that by 5 minutes I had a serious case of motion sickness, and had to turn it off after 10 more minutes. Thinking I just needed to sit a bit further away, the next night I tried again but nope, same thing happened. It's so frustrating, all these amazing shots but not one is one screen for more than 2 seconds before it fast cuts to another. What happened to watching a gently unfolding natural drama? Why can't we linger a while to drink in the beauty of a scene?This is documentary for the ADD generation. If your child has a problem concentrating on anything for more then 0.5 seconds, then this disc is ideal. Anyone else should stock up on the Dramamine and get ready with the pause button before watching this deeply flawed disc."
4,Magnificent!!,"It is a wonderful series of documentaries!!! Magical!!Lovely landscapes, sounds and narration!!I'd prefer though all National Geographic documentaries to have English Subtitles for the non native speakers!"
2,script fail,"The content was good, but like other reviewers mentioned, the narration is ridiculous. There was also a lot of repetition, and some pretty outlandish statements. There were a few good moments of lava/water explosions. So if you're really bored with nothing else to do, meh, give it a watch I guess."
2,"It's too bad, really.","The excellent footage in this program is, sadly, presented with unbearable narration. It seems to be an attempt to make a nature show exciting, but instead... comes off with the personality of a second rate magician trying to sell up a bad act. The script really reminds me of the character ""Gob"" in the short run series ""Arrested Development."" I've got to say, I'm disappointed with National Geographic for this one, it sure did have promise. Note: My review is based solely on the first episode, as I could not stand to watch any more."
2,Horrible narration,"The narration is horrible, sounds like it was made for elementary school children to watch in class. Stick to Planet Earth."
1,HORRIBLE FILM EDITING - THE USUAL NEW ERA OF N.G. JUNK,"HOPEFULLY, National Geographic is reading this for they seriously need to wake up and stop this non sense with film editing that looks like someone addicted to Heroine got a hold of. ITS A NATURE DOCUMENTARY, not a skateboarders documentary - let people's eyes focus on the one last thing that is natural to us...the planet.Recommendations, watch most of what BBC is doing for nature documentaries. (like the 'Planet Earth' series or 'Yellowstone HD'). Those videos have nice easy panning, articulate narration, useful information, and the series allows you to enjoy earth as it is.I ended my subscriptions to National Geographic Magazine on the basis of how POORLY their documentaries (nature and animal coverage) have become. Its ""rock n roll"" meets ""drugs in the film editing room"" meets ""nature""....ENTIRELY UNACCEPTABLE!!!"
2,Lame,Seems like it was intended for a Grade 3 educational video. Nothing in the first 5 minutes for anyone with a high school education. (5 minutes was all I could take) The narration falls well short of the high bar set by David Attenborough's work in similar BBC productions like Planet Earth. Pretty pictures got it two stars rather than one.
2,Unwatchable,"My wife and I love nature documentaries, but we couldn't finish this one. After 3 or 4 minutes of the third episode we gave up - the constant rapid camera movement and cuts were just too painful. Not recommended."
3,Amazingly loud soundtrack,"If I didn't find the subject matter so interesting I would have turned this off in five minutes. The background noise (some may call it music) in the soundtrack is so loud that you can barely hear the narrator's voice unless you turn the volume up to pain levels. I just watched 15 minutes of it and my ears are still ringing!That said the the perspective of our planet presented in this documentary is quite captivating and the cinematography is first rate. If you can stand the noise it's well worth watching, but if you want your hearing to last long enough to hear your grandchildren's first words then you may want to avoid watching this one too often.(Note: this review is based on the broadcast version of the show, not the DVD release.)"
3,"Decent, light on actual information","National Geographic is targeting the average, scientifically uneducated with this show. Routine viewers of deeper, more informative documentaries will probably want to pass on this one. This is entry level popularization of science; its effort isn't spent on trying to inform the viewer, but rather to make them marvel at the natural world in general. They slip in the science when they can, trying to keep the viewer enthralled with ostentatious narration and (dodgy) CG.I liked the first two episodes for what they were, and would suggest it to someone that has only a passing interest and education in science. A person that's not quite ready to read Carl Sagan, but would pay attention to a scientific documentary long enough to absorb some useful information.For the rest of us, there are better options in my opinion."
1,Worthless...,"Loud music, thriller narration instead of documentary narration, more loud music which makes it hard to hear the awful narrator, and all animation... The pictures that you see on the cover have nothing to do with this documentary since this is animation not nature. Both the producer and the director must have been on a very strong cool aid on this documentary... worthless."
2,Melodrama spoiles an interesting show,"Spectacular footage and interesting information. However, it is almost ruined by the melodramatic, fatalistic narration. Depicting the earth as something with ""weapons and bombs"" loaded and ready (volcanoes) marching us all to our demise. Perhaps the creators felt that earth on its own is not exciting enough so they needed to add Hollywood drama but for us, it caused us to turn the program off after a while."
2,For the young and easily excitable,"The narrator is a well known actress who shouldn't have stooped to such blatent hysteria-mongering and pandering. I thought this would have the class and educational value of some of the similarly titled documentaries. Instead, I spent so much time sifting through the overblown language, immature metaphors and doom and gloom cliches, that I didn't take away anything beyond a refresher of few small facts I probably learned in elementary school. Felt more like the trailer to a Giant Killer Wave summer blockbuster than anything else. Can I have this hour of my life back please?"
3,Meh,"Clips were too short and moved too fast, narration was sophomoric. I like The Dog Whisperer. Why bother? The movie"
2,Too much fluff to fill time.,"Like most Discovery Channel, History Channel offerings, it tries to stretch 15 minutes of materials to fill an hour. Watch similar shows on BBC instead if you value your time."
1,Producers: don't cheap out on the music!,"I would really love to watch this series, but literally couldn't keep it on, due to the absolutely terrible music playing in the background. Too bad, because the graphics and videos seem ""amazing."" David Attenborough's ""Planet Earth"" is a far better choice if you're in the mood for this kind of docu."
4,A little over dramatic,The beginning is a bit over the top in an attempt to get you to watch I suppose. This film has some interesting information on the destructive forces of nature and is worth seeing. I watched it for free with Prime
1,Visually impressive but ruined by hyperbole,Unforgivably atrocious writing and narration have turned a potentially excellent documentary into sensationalist pablum. I barely managed to sit through the first episode. I can only hope that there's an alternate sound track version available (a la the Planet Earth series.)
3,Disappointed,"I bought this DVD after VERY careful research. My children had video cassettes when they were little of a program called Amazing Planet by National Geographic that had 4 aliens flying around the planet on missions. I enjoyed the shows as much as my children and when I saw that I could purchase multiple shows on one DVD, I did. This DVD clearly stated in the description ""starring Pat Cashman"" who was the ""Captain"" on the show. However, I was more than disappointed when I discovered this DVD was not the one I had wanted. If you're looking for the children's program ""Amazing Planet,"" this isn't it. Regardless, this was a great program even though it was not what I was looking for.Whomever is responsible for the mistake in the credits ought to correct it."
2,Here Nature is Ruined by Writing,"Well, we know there is a lot of magma, lava, etc, but ""Hell""? Really? That seems to diminish the fascination that is Earth. It's a sad attempt, not worth watching with the sound on, and like the others said in reviews...over dramatic. The writing doesn't support the title of ""Amazing Planet""."
4,Good,Liked the presentation. Don't necessarily agree with all the theories but still gives a lot of insight into the current geographical scenario.
3,Hidden Creek,"It was very well written, but the story is a bit 19th century.In contemporary writing the girl would have been raped by the men in her life. Interesting to read however."
2,Good Work Poorly Printed,"There's is plenty of good work in the book and the introductions by Carter and Horton Foote are both interesting reads. Unfortunately, this is one of the worst printed books I've seen in a long, long time. I'm uncertain if it's just a few isolated copies or if the entire run is like this, but it pretty much ruins the viewing experience."
5,A great inspiring book,"This is a remake of Keith's first book, but even better. D J Stout redesigned it, and Pat and Keith added more descriptions about the images and details about how the project got started. An added feature I really like was the printed contact sheets in the book. You can see that Keith doesn't belabor the shooting, but seems to know exactly what he wants. No 20 rolls of film to get one shot! Also, the printing is beautiful. I read another review posted here, and the person said it was printed terribly, but it is not true. Keith tones and split tones his images, and they are reproduced very close to the originals. I think maybe the reviewer thought these tones were unintentional. Keith has made maybe a dozen books, and has been very experimental. This book shows us again, in a refreshing way, where he started. The book is inspiring because it shows a good idea completed, a photographer who can make art out of any subject, as well as a love story between a man and his wife."
1,Not a Good Lesson for Children,"After hearing good things about this book, I decided to buy it to read to the young children at our school. When I received it in the mail, I read it immediately. While the illustrations were good, it was an extremely disappointing story. The story shows that unkind behavior and words should be returned with more unkind behavior and words. I don't understand why this book has so many good reviews, when it teaches children such bad behavior and feelings. I found it to be a very negative story, and I threw my copy in the trash."
5,Beautiful on the Inside,"""Charlie the Caterpillar"" is a wonderful learning story for childern. Charlie, through encounters with other animals is made to feel inferior, and ugly because he is a caterpillar. After transforming into a beautiful butterfly and meeting another caterpillar he discovers that true friends don't judge you by your appearance.The illustrations are bright and cheerful."
5,A childhood favorite,"My all-time favorite childhood favorite. Every night, my mother and father would read this book to my brother and me (by request!) Twenty-five years later, I'm still taken back to those quiet evenings every time I read it. I hope to read it to my children one day."
5,Great Book for Little Ones!!,"My children ages 2 and 4 love this book. It is a cute story about a catapillar exploring his new world, but finding out others aren't always nice. Curtis then becomes a beautiful butterfly and everyone wants to be his friend. The story teaches kids about being nice to someone no matter what they appear to be on the outside, but in a very simplistic way. We read it every night before bed."
4,great book about friends,"My children and I love this story. It teaches us what a true friend is. The illustrations are very colorful and cute. My 3 year old enjoys saying with me ""Now I gotta giddadda here!"" It may be slang but it's the meaning of the story that is important."
2,Not what I thought,"I purchased this album hoping for the rich sound of a classic song. If you are an Edith Pilaf fan, you will probably enjoy this CD. I will continue my search because I don't like the grainy vocal quality of this person. If you are someone whose French is a little rusty...don't look for a translation in lyrics. There are none. Edith Pilaf fans..enjoy! All others...steer clear of this one."
5,Must-read for everyone writing ads,"Shorter than I expected, but very informative and well worth the money. Everyone who writes ads should read this book."
4,Una buena historia sobre El Salvador,"Respeto a los que comparan cualquier cosa que leen con las novelas de Isabel Allende, pero les recuerdo que la Allende escribe basicamente sobre Chile aunque su influencia se deje sentir en las novelas femeninas del resto de latinoamerica. Hay que leer sobre otros paises tambien! Esta novela sobre El Salvador esta bastante bien.Cuenta la historia de una familia, al estilo La Casa de la Laguna de Rosario Ferre, pero el hecho de que la historia transcurra en un pais centroamericano, cuya economia gira alrededor del cafe, le da sus diferencias.El lenguaje es sencillo y claro, de facil lectura."
4,"This edition is small, make sure to get the bigger one","This book is very small. Comparing with the bigger version, the white space surrounding the graphics are trimmed off. It lacks room for the tabs and flaps to move nicely. However, if you like a compact version that's ok."
1,Once Quality ---- Now Cheapo,"I remember the days when the Flexible Flyer was a thing of quality. Made in the USA out of solid oak and steel. A sled on which any kid could do a belly flopper and never worry about the sled withstanding all the abuse. Now the sled, still called the Flexible Flyer is made in China. No longer made with oak, but another kind of wood. (Not sure what kind.) It is a very unstable sled and I will rework it to make it more stable before I give it to my grandson."
1,Piece of Junk,Purchased two flexible flyers for my kids. After very little use 4 (aluminum)rivets snapped. If I paid $25 for these I could understand them using cheaper materials but these were expensive sleds. I have tried to contact the manufacturer but have not been able to find any contact info. Save your $$ and buy anything else. These sleds will not last!!
1,Junk,"I ordered this sled for my daughter in 2007 (from another seller - not Amazon) and this is the first year we have been able to try it. After less than an hour, she brought it back inside missing one of the aluminum rivets attaching the front wood frame to the metal. The other side's was detached, but the piece had not yet fallen out. It is worthless, since as a single mom, I am clueless as to how to re-secure it and I question it's safety. I am disgusted by the made in China 48"" Flexible Flyer and am surprised I cannot find any recall information or data on how to contact the manufacturer. I would not recommend - it was a total waste of money."
1,FLEXIBLE FLYER SLED,"cheap thin wooden slats. the middle slat had a crack down the middle. we super glued it ,trying to make it last thru the season .the company should be ashamed of itself ! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
5,Great book for food buying,"This book gives you clear and concise instructions on what foods to buy, what combinations to buy, and what foods to avoid. While some of the foods may be a tad difficult to acquire, most stores have the majority of foods she recommends. This is not a diet book. This is a book that makes you look at food as fuel rather than comfort or rewards."
1,Too difficult to obtain these superfoods,"I find that it wil not only be a big hassle, which is to be expected, but also expensive and too difficult to find these superfoods"
1,Living Food for Health,"I began to question some of the claimed internal results of eating certain foods while reading the book. Reading some other reviews on the web confirmed my opinions. Dr. McKeith (questionable qualifications too) may have some opinions but offers no real proof and some real questionable ways of analyzing deficiencies. She claims research backs her ideas but gives no proof and uses questionable sources. While we are offered video accounts on TV of her results but these are skewed subjects. They are astounding garbage eaters, almost any diet of nourishing foods would probably achieve the same results. The book is probably a sham.Allan Hammer"
5,Best Punk EVER,"Buy this album and you wont be let down. This is absolutely the best punk ever, hands down! Buy it now!http://www.myspace.com/threekindsofirony"
4,coolness,dis is a cool album. de young and de hopeless is such an awesome soung. But i would by de album the young and the hopeless cuz it has lots of other cool songs like the anthem and lifestyles of the rich and famous and girls and boys
1,Not to put to fine a point on it...,"but this book is worthless. The one key phrase in the book, ""with passion,"" is obvious. The rest of the book is meaningless filler about the author's experience looking at things. It's just devoid of content."
5,Are you smarter than a 5th grader???,"Goes on fairly easy if you don't try to hammer in crooked. Make sure you tap it in straight and you shouldn't have a problem. If you get it started crooked, and keep hammering, you will have problems because then the housing gets distorted; almost like putting a square peg in a round hole!Go easy, watch what you are doing and its a piece of cake.Good product, well made, and half the price of the other guys and is nearly as good.I'm using this on a utility trailer so it won't be in the water. If your using on a boat trailer, (especially saltwater) you might consider a stainless steel version from another manufacture."
2,1/2 price and twice the effort,"I would give these one star, but they do work and work well once you've actually installed them. However, I bought a set of these and set of the traditional bearing buddies; bearing buddies install 40seconds or less; these 10 minutes of wiggling and jiggling to get them perfectly fit into and stay in. I will spend the extra dollars next time for two sets of bearing buddies!"
4,"A real relaxing, easy read","This book was a detour from my usual murder-mystery reading, and an enjoyable detour it was. It was a relaxing, easy read, easy on the mind and spirit, a nice book to read when you want to wind down and visit or revisit, in your mind, the times and years of the Depression. I found the author's characters interesting, enjoyable and real. I was disappointed to have the book come to an end when it did, and look forward to a sequel, hopefully."
5,love these things !,"I have used these body scrubs for years. Have been unable to find them anymore at the store, so went looking online. They make your skin feel so refreshed. Just remember - do not squeeze them to get the water out, just shake downward. They will last longer if you do this ! Very invigorating !"
5,Love it!,"I absolutely LOVE this body scrub. I have had trouble finding them and couldn't remember the product name from the last one I purchased. I got lucky and found one in the discount aisle at K-Mart (for only a dollar). I am happy to know that I can get them whenever I need them instead of combing the aisles at Wal-Mart with my fingers crossed.The body scrub will last much longer if you do not squeeze the soap out of it, instead run it under the water until the soap is gone then shake the excess water out and let it air dry."
3,NOT pack of 5,"The title says pack of 5 but you only get a single pack. Product was fabulous at first but after the first couple of uses, it flattens out and shrinks. Won't last long.EDIT - seems they changed the title. It no longer says pack of 5. Thanks!"
3,Okay for the price,Price was good but the product didn't last more than a few uses. I used it for self-tanning exfoliation and it shrunk within the second use. Rec. buying more than one if you use them a lot. Other than that good product.
3,Body scrub,"The product was good except, that when I placed my order, I had to email you notifing, that you were 1 product short, but I did received in a timely fashion, I will be ordering more in the future.Martina Esquivel"
4,This was a gift to someone else.,This was a bought as a gift to someone else so I really can't say much about it.
4,Intrusion Prevention Help,This book was really helpful! Our company really needed a solution for a prevention/response system. We already had an IDS system but needed something for the attacks. Once our company was under attack we had no way of stopping it. This book really helped us to make an intelligent decision and the company went with the Interceptor.NET from Network Intercept. They were found on www.networkintercept.com. This book explains all about how these kind of systems work and was really knowledgeable. Highly recommend!
4,Very good,Just sit in from of the tv and peddle away. Very good way to lose those extra lbs. Didn't want to pay for a bicycle so this was the next best thing.
3,Broken on delivery,"It seems that 2000 flushes have been replaced in most stores by their own store brands but I prefer 2000 flushes. I was glad to find a place to purchase them but was disappointed when they arrived broken up. Broken tablets disolve much faster, therefore not lasting as long. I do not know if the problem was packaging or delivery."
2,X-Files season 2,"I ordered the second season of X-Files. I did receive my order quickly, but one of the discs would not play. :("
1,Can't believe they're missing the season 2 finale,I can't believe that this set of discs is missing the last episode of season 2 which continues into the first 2 episodes of season 3. Now I have to save my video tape of the episode. How could they not have corrected this?
5,The Abduction,"With the future of the X-Files in doubt at the end of season one, Christ Carter and co. introduce new characters to the conspiracy. Agent ""X"", a new but not-so-willing informant for Mulder, the infamous ""Agent"" Alex Krycek, and the shape-shifting Alien Bounty Hunter. The Cigarette-Smoking Man takes on a much larger roll as does A.D. Skinner. A surprise abduction leads to the re-instating of the X-Files, and Mulder and Scully begin to learn of the plans for colonization as well as a surprising secret about Bill Mulder's past. The season finale will leave you stunned and on the edge of your seat.Mythology episdoes include: Little Green Men, Sleepless, Duane Barry, Ascension, One Breath, Colony, End Game, and Anasazi."
3,GOOD BUT...,"Things to consider about this product:- Image and sound are not so good, especially because it's an old programme.- It's 2.1 and not 5.1- The package (the boxes) are too thin.- It's much cheaper than the collector's edition but it does not include something important for collectors, the 7th CD with the extras!!- I still do not understand why FOX overprices the collector's edition and makes it impossible for us to buy it. I think it is too expensive!! Besides if they want to save money in packaging, why did they eliminate the 7th cd? How much money can it cost to add that CD? Please!!!- The series is excellent and worth watching."
5,WOW,"This was incredible. I wasn't expecting this much plot development/charachter development/story/action/sheer brilliance when I bought this. I LOVE the x-files, but I never got to watch it when it was running on tv. This was great. A definate five stars and a good reccomendation to anyone."
4,Good stuff,"I didn't really catch on as a fan of the series until the third season, mainly because when it began, it was on Friday nights and I was either working or out somewhere. So, it was great to get the second season, as it contained episodes I'd never seen before."
5,barbaraH,My order came faster than expected and was in great condition. I would definitely order from this company again.
2,Can be skipped,"this episode is not very interesting. If you are going through all the episodes and seasons and don't want to waste your time, this is a good one to skip."
2,missing episode,"I was very happy with this product, but I also realized that episode 25 was missing. I didn't realize this until I got to the end of disk 6."
2,Missing episode!,"BEWARE!!!! As of March 2008, there is still a problem with DVDs being sent out with the season 2 finale missing! The episode ""Anasazi"" was missing from disc 6 that I received just recently. Amazon says they will replace it, but I am not convinced the replacement won't have the same problem. I've seen comments about this problem going back over 2 years. I'm disgusted that the bad DVDs haven't been removed from the shelves by now. Terrible. BEWARE!!!!"
3,now the real versions please...,"These DVDs are great in that we can now own on DVD all of the original episodes from all of the seasons. Having said that, when X-Files is shown on TV, it says: ""presented in Dolby Surround"" at the beginning of each episode. Any dolby surround track is nowhere to be found on these DVD's. Why is that? Also, where is the widescreen presentation that the episodes are filmed in? These episodes we get on DVD are pan and scan...Fox should re-release these box sets as widescreen verions with the proper surround sound."
3,"Disappointing second season, but buy it anyway!","I found season 2 ultimately disappointing. The first season on the XFiles was filled with exciting and new stories many of which were loosly based on actual unexplained incidents or phenomena. The second season went a little off the rails in this sense, not seeing the need to flesh out it's main characters further, and I guess not helped by Gillian Andersens pregnancy which made her absent from episodes and less prone to leaping about in action sequences! Nonetheless it does have a few redeeming episodes, and any X-phile who has the first season on DVD knows this second season can only be something very special to keep for future viewing. You finally have a good reason to tape over those episodes you recorded to keep off the TV!"
4,"A very good, must have book for all web designers.","This is a great, much needed, update from the past version of Creative Html Design. HTML Design is a very important subject to know as a web designer and developer, simply because not everyone is capable of seeing media, such as Shockwave Flash. This book covers everything from Layout to Effective Design techniques using new HTML programming improvements (DHTML), always keeping the readers' attention and interest using a unique style that you can notice in most of Lynda's books. If you are a web designer you definitely need this book, not only for a souce of learning, but also for a great reference. Knowing effective design techniques and having good layout skills is totally going to affect the effect and impact of your multimedia designs. I recommend this book if you are looking for an easy to read yet effective approach at creative web design with HTML, from a web designers' point of view."
4,A Good Book to Own,"I didn't really read this book because I didn't need the information yet, but I think it's a great book to have in your collection."
4,Stabbing Westward...History...,"Man, I love this band. If they could only sell more things...if only they could come back...good all rock of the 90's..."
5,Ungod - Stabbing Westward,"Stabbing Westward is absolutely phenomenal on this disc; WBBP and Darkest Days are equally incredible, but the self-titled disc doesn't have quite the bite as the previous three.Regardless, I highly recommend anything by Stabbing Westward if you like industrial/alternative rock that actually carries a message - the lyrics combined with the music give you no choice but to scrutinize and reflect upon your life: ""When I've reached the end, will anything I've done mean anything?""Stabbing Westward is not merely a charismatic band who has hastily assembled a collection of catchy percussion, good riffs, and meaningless, unintelligible lyrics; Stabbing Westward is music with a message."
5,Raw and powerful,"This is not an album to blend into the backround when with friends. This C.D. is envolving of the listener, because of the emotion that Christopher Hall puts into all the songs in all the aspects that he does. The music is brutal and raw, so if you like that sort of thig this C.D. is an excelent buy."
3,For Comparative Purposes,"Listen to this album and Filter's SHORT BUS back to back and hear the similarities. Particularly on ""Hey Man, Nice Shot"" and ""Ungod."" You see, Stabbing Westward started with a guitarist, I forget his name, who would leave after UNGOD and join Filter just in time for SHORT BUS. It appears he took his riffs with him."
3,Good.,"Frequently compared to Nine Inch Nails--who are themselves only a shadow of the true industrial genre cast on the pop world--this band is pop-industrial at best. They're a band for the 13-17 age group who are consumed by self-centered angst.""Ungod"" is unquestionably this band's best release. The quality of their albums has steadily diminished with each release, until finally reaching the abysmal nadir of their self-titled CD, which is utterly unlistenable. Still, their first effort shows some true creativity and a glimmer of the uncompromising, challenging ideal that is industrial.The rest of the reviewers need to be educated on the definition of 'industrial'. The fact that nobody has ever posted a similar denunciation here is evidence that people who know what industrial is do not listen to this music. Needless to say, you see my comments here because I have a soft spot for this worthy attempt at something big."
4,Give it a chance,"The first time I listened this CD, I had just gotten off a big all-night Nine Inch Nails bender. I thought, ""Well, Stabbing Westward is ok, but they lack a certain charisma..."" Then I promptly put the cd away and forgot about it for a month or so.Then I listened to it again with fresh ears. My opinion has changed considerably. I now listen to it at least twice a week if not more and I've just bought Wither Blister Burn & Peel. I plan to get Darkest Days soon as well.The music is dark, yet accessible and melodic. There are driving guitars and drums but there is an underlying harmony that holds it all together. I wouldn't call it industrial, really, and I sure as hell wouldn't call it pop. It's hard to categorize, actually. It's just good music."
1,Lame psudo-industrial pretty boys!,"I would give these cheese-eating gymps negative five stars if I could. Where NIN opened industrial up to MTV, these chumps make it mall-safe. This latest offering is more of the same junk. Save yourself the cash and go out and get a 'Back Street Boys' CD."
1,"Please Buy Darkest Days, not this album","Honestly, I am nuts about stabbing westward, but this is easily their worst album. When I got Darkest Days, I could not stop listening to it, Darkest Days might be the best album i have ever bought, but Ungod is a mistake. This album does not even sound like stabbing westward. I mean you dont need to take my advice, but I would steer clear of this one if I were you."
1,Exceptions,"I like their works, but Ungod is not a good name. Please keep away from such antichristian things. Thank you."
2,However not bad film is poor DVD.,"This is not bad movie. but It has been routine story-line, mediocre musical drama, above all things poor quality. How? Awful! English caption? No, Unavailable! I was very disappointed with it's clearance."
1,Terrible Performance,"This is the worst misreading of this fine, but underplayed and underappreciated symphony I've ever heard. Jarvi clearly does not understand or care about the music and his orchestra doesn't help. Awful. Stick with Previn, Ashkenazy, or someone who knew and worked with the composer, Ormandy. Pass this one up."
1,you can paint your own masterpiece - but not with this book!,"the authors use pictures of original masterpieces and try to copy them.if you expect to read about techniques that were used in the original paintings you are wrong. if you think the authors would explain the styles of the original paintings and how they achieved it, you are wrong again.in fact there is nothing in this book which could help you with painting in any way. all the explanations go like: first paint the background, then paint the face. now put the highlights on the face. never anything useful at all!the only reason why it earned this one star is because the pictures of the famous original paintings are fine and there is a small biography of the artist for each of them.anyway - if you want pictures and biographies, please buy another book!"
3,"Okay, not a real distraction","Our pup enjoyed a few segments of the video, like the cats, and the turkeys. He ignored most of it and I can't see this being a big enough distraction from chewing on books when left alone in the house."
1,dont waste the money,If my dog could she would have left the house and moved out. This is terrible. Bored me and the dog. She paid no attention to it at all.
3,Dog Alone time,"My dog is recovering from separation anxiety and we are still working on her issues. This video appeared to be very entertaining for my dog and my mom's dog. They loved the noises especially the bird scenes. I won't say they even noticed the pictures, but definitely the sounds. I left the two dogs alone for about three hours while I worked in my garden. The dogs were not friends before this point, and when I came back inside, they were lying on the couch side by side asleep.. So I will say this had a very calming effect on them..."
5,Love it,"My chihuahua absolutely loves it. I think her favorite is the squirrel. The sounds are great, I wish the animals ran though, my dog loves to bark at the tv when animals are running. She watches it for 2 hours before she gets bored. She can't take her eyes off the tv. The cat loved the mice, the cat ran behind the tv looking for the mice. You can play it continously in the loop. Great product."
3,"Decent enough. But I wish they'd spent less time on small animals, and more on the larger ones.","We'd noticed some time ago that our two rotties always get a thrill when a dog or larger animal shows up on the TV. So we purchased this, intending to sit back and watch our doggies have a really good time.It's not bad. But it focuses too much on small animals (mice in cages, squirrels) which for some reason our dogs had zero interest in.But hey -- it was cheap. And if you have dogs or cats that like watching smaller animals like mice or squirrels, it's probably a winner."
1,Very Disappointing. Period.,I have been looking forward to purchasing this video and decided to get Vol. 1 and 2. Me and my doggies waited for their arrival with anticipation! What a disappointment. I decided to watch the DVD's with them so I could see what they were like...horrible! Sorry but I could have done a better job. THIS IS OF NO REFLECTION ON THE SELLER OF THIS ITEM. DVD's were new and of good product quality. The DVD's content were just horrible.
5,RufusChrist,"Jeffro from San Fransisco (Another review) says it, all these guys are just simply amazing! If you can make a show you must go. I saw them from front row in Des Moines (Val Air Ballroom). At first I had no idea who this band was but the energy and the sound they put off set the crowd alive, I had to find out who they were. I loved them from the first song on."
4,forget comparisons,"zappa, beefheart, waits...yes, one can hear those artists present, but really, how many kids today know about all that? this is a weird record. and this is why i like it. they are not afraid to take chances. now if they could only concentrate on writing better ""songs"". i know the focus is on the manic live shows, but ultimately an act is remembered for their actual audio product. this is all that lasts. was big star a great live show? was neu!? who cares! they still matter thirty years on. why? the songs. that said, give this twisted effort a chance and you may just be singing like a drunken viking by morning."
1,didn't work for me,"This is mostly plastic and wiggles way too much - the hole saw caught on the first door I tried, and walked away from where it should have been (the plastic isn't strong enough to keep it in place). The centering function on the end of the door is poor as well. I threw mine in the trash. Look on ebay - you can find old models (From other manufacturers) that were made from metal."
3,Good valuable tool for door lock installations,"This little gadget works very well in helping to install locks in standard-sized doors. Simply screw the guide onto the door edge and drill the two holes for the locks with the included hole saws. However, the hole saws supplied are not that great. They will dull pretty quickly. Anyway, for the inexpensive cost this set is a pretty good value."
1,Garbage,"The center drill portion of the hole saw was so far out of true that it could not be used. Some careful measuring and shimming got it near true, that's when I realized the hole saws were both oval, not round. The shaking due to being out-of-round made the face jig wander 1/4"" too low during drilling (it is free to slide up and down even with the jig screwed down!). Because of the shape the saw cut a hole bigger than it should have, and because it wasn't round it had to cut a lot more wood than it should have. I got a hole the wrong size in the wrong location and it took me a long time to do it. Then I cut the 1"" diameter edge hole and things went from bad to worse. The ""self centering"" jig cut a hole nearly 1/4"" off center, too far off to mount the strike plate. It took hours to fix the door after using this tool.I threw this thing in the garbage. Don't throw your money away on this."
1,Don't buy...,"Let me admit up front that I did not buy or use this device. I considered it, but after taking a close look at it, I decided I would not risk my 80 year old, just refinished, irreplaceable Dutch door (the existing hole in my door was too small, so I needed to enlarge it, which is considerably more difficult/risky than drilling a hole in the first instance). This model is clearly too flimsy, screwing it into place won't hold it taught, and it is just not worth the risk. I spent a little more ($25) for a similar contraption made by Blu-Mol on sale at my local Home Depot. You apply it to the door with a built in vice clamp; it comes with spacers to perfectly match the width of the door. It provides a guide on both sides of the door so when you saw halfway through, you only need to flip the door over and go the rest of the way. The hole saw that came with it is not top notch, but what do you expect for $25. Regardless, it went through my door like butter, as they say."
3,Saccharine,"I liked Jeanne McCann's first book even though it was clumsy in places, so I was willing to give her another try...Sad to say, she hasn't made much improvement in her writing style. Her heart is there, but the characters lack all depth. They are just too good to be believed. Their hearts are always full, their heartstrings are always being tugged.In fact, the word heart is overused throughtout the book.I had a problem with the resolution, too. As a parent, I of course put my children first when their health, safety and education are at risk. But otherwise I must balance my needs against theirs, understanding that if I sacrifice too much, my generous parenting will eventually suffer. These women didn't nurture themselves enough. Sooner or later -- if they were real women and not such sweet fakes -- they were going to burn out.I'm not sure I'll read another McCann book. I like a little depth in my sweets, and this book left me with a sugar headache."
3,A little too big,"Nice and wide on head, but needs a longer Velcro band to fit a little more securely. Also stretches out a bit."
1,Light constantly on after the first two weeks,The light stays on constantly and won't re-set. If I had wanted a patio light I would have kept the one I had
3,Accessories not in package,The 150 watt halogen bulb was not in the package. It was supposed to be included. I finally purchased one rather than return the entire package.
4,Outdoor security.,"Works great. Only weakness is the intermittent on-off when windy, but I guess they all do. Easily to install and set up."
2,Bendy but sketchy,"I wanted to use this wrest to bend around all of my desktop products. The bendability is solid, but the wire inside the ""foam"" starts slicing through the side of the wrist guard after too many bends. So try and bend it right the first time.Not bad for the price though, you can always find a use for it somwehere. I have it protecting a sharp edge of my desk right now, with a better other wrist guard."
4,Matches the price,"Paid six bucks for it and it is most definitively a six dollar product. You can see the metal stick coming out of the bottom, but like I said, it was only six bucks, so I'm not displeased with it."
4,Collect the set,I like having the volume around for reference and find it a good addition to the series.
4,Clash of the Sax Titans Now Remastered For a Better Sound!,Two greats of the tenor saxophone together in a battle royale! Now we get this classic encounter digitally remastered for a great sound and also in a neat mini-lp replica sleeve packaging too. The best version of this classic that's out there at the moment if you don't mind paying the premium. Recommended.
5,"Not just a fine first novel--a fine novel, period","Geoff Becker's novel is a subtle, warm-hearted, funny, observant treasure of a book. I only wish I'd read it when it first came out. Rarely have I found a novel by a young writer with so little cynicism in it. Every sentence is handsomely, expertly crafted, and the story gathers emotional force with clarity and resolve. This is the best father-son novel I've read in years, capturing all the nuances of that difficult, misunderstood, treacherous, holy bond; what Cheever called ""my future and my doom."" It made my summer."
3,RD Klein? Huh? What ever happened to Philip Kerns?,"Philip Kerns wrote ""Fake It Till You Make It"" in 1982. He was featured on the Phil Donahue Show and 60 Minutes. His book allegedly sold over 1 million copies and reportedly caused a 30% drop in recruitment for Amway. Is RD Klein a psuedonym for Philip Kerns? If Klein wrote a book about Amway with that title, then he was not the first. There is no US Government Copyright Office record of Klein's book being copyrighted. A new book, copyrighted, will be published either in December of 2002 or January 2003 that is a 20th anniversary follow-up to Kerns' original book. Stay tuned..."
5,Touching story of a man and his dog,This is a very touching story between a man and his dog....if only everyone could spend time with their pets as Joe has. I wonder how Nellie is doing now?
3,OK,Its ok but I didnt enjoy it. Seemes like some unauthorised company not Motown made this and maybe they were allowed to by them. But its really bad I am sorry I bought this
4,great doc - bad title,"This is a really well made doc on a single motogp race weekend. The problem is in the title of the movie. The title shoud've been ""Hopper, the tornado and the kentucky kid"". Doesn't really have the same ring I guess. John Hopkins is featured more than almost any other racer in the film, and rightfully so. He's a good solid racer. But I was mislead by the title into thinking Rossi would be featured more. Nonetheless, this is a really entertaining and informative film on motogp. The bonus disc is really good too.Really good interviews. The on board camera on Rossi's M1 is great! But I think that's for the more serious of race fans. If you are just becoming interested in motogp, buy this DVD!"
4,Liked it,"I like it, however, there is not enough about The Doctor in it to justify that being the title of the movie."
3,"Ok, nothing special","If you already saw Faster by Mark Neale, (which is excellent), this is a bit disappointing. Interviews are OK, but the race wasnt one of the better MotoGP races that year."
2,Hated it,"I love motogp, but when i watched this, i found it very slighted and biased toward American racer Nicky Haden. who cares, just because he won once. it says ""the doctor, the tornado and the kentucky kid"" not just the kentucky kid, which was all this film was about.lame."
3,Does It Translate?,"I love motorcycle racing and have attended the MotoGP at Laguna Seca several times. It's one fun, sensory-overloading blast as well as a total ""scene"" off of the track. Doc, Tornado & Kid was very watchable for me, primarily because I'd just as soon watch motorcycling of any kind as anything else.Still, I wasn't knocked over by it although I'm not sure I could blame the production itself. It simply may not be the best subject matter when the ""real thing"" is so mind-bogglingly outrageous."
4,"The Doctor, the Tornado and the Kentucky kid",The DVD was delivered twice to me but both versions were for region one so I could not use it in Europe. Meanwhile I bought it via a European channel and found the content great!
2,The epic that never was...,"A sequel to Faster (ibid). It's about a rivalry that never was (the title refers to the nicknames of Valentino Rossi, Nicky Hayden and Colin Edwards), at a racetrack woefully hyped and out of date, on an occasion (the return of MotoGP to the US) that no one except some die-hards cared much about. Mark Neale, who managed access to the riders on an intimate scale in Faster, here goes for inane comments and filler. Neale tries to create an epic out of a very ordinary GP race. It's all rather tiring. Good race footage, though. Skip it or buy it used...there should be plenty about."
4,A little long.. Nice behind the scenes look .. MotoGP.,"The Doctor(Rossi) The Tornado(edwards) & The Kentuck Kid(hayden) Not much Kawasaki(other haydens different series) coverage of course I know they are not popular as others. Good Behind the scenes motoGp Stuff. Lots of action,Good Soundtrack."
4,Great stuff if you're a fan.,"A great in-depth look at what happens at a MotoGP weekend. Very interesting if you're already a fan and could make some new ones. McGreggor does a good job narrating this one, as he did on the first."
3,"Don't Expect Much ""The Doctor""","I went to the USGP in 2005, and it was a spectacular event. The event itself was more exciting than the actual race itself, where Hayden totally dominated. I was excited to get this DVD in the mail and see all the behind the scenes look at the USGP but ended up disappointed. The quality was very bad, and you can see all the pixelization. They should have included all the bonuses on the 2nd disc and left the first the pure documentary by itself. That way they could have preserved the quality of the footage instead of trying to fit too much onto one disc. Don't let the title fool you. If you are expecting a lot of valentino Rossi footage and interview, you will be let down. There is about 5 minutes total of Vale on this disc. They should have named the movie ""The Tornado, the Hopper, and the Kentucky Kid"" since the documentary focuses on those 3. Guess if they had put that on the cover, Vale fans wouldn't even blink at it, but they got us!"
3,Where's the Doctor?,"Overall, the movie was done well. I just haven't figured out why Valentino Rossi was bypassed for interviews when his name is in the title of the documentary, yet other motorcyclists that are not in the title received plenty of air time. Since Valentino Rossi is the biggest name in MotoGP, how can you leave him out?I do, however feel that there was a lot of pertinent information given, especially for a newbie like me that is just learning about this competitive sport."
4,flatware storage,I was looking for a minimal space storage for silverware we inherited from my mother in-law. I wanted to be able to access it easily as well as have it not tarnish. I am very pleased with how this product works. I can put it in a closet out of the way yet get to it easily. This was a great transaction!
1,Misleading Item Title,"The title line on this product (""Healthy Origins Vitamin E 1000 I.U"") is very misleading! This is not a 1000 IU softgel capsule. I didn't notice that the photo indicated that these are a difference strength."
3,A good little introduction,"If you consider the target audience and the size of the book, it is OK and by no means intends to be an authority of the subject. The recipes seem toned down in terms of chilli use but is pretty authentic and full of simple recipes anyone can make and little to no use of hard to find ingredients such as various chillies.This is available in places as a PDF so look around and get yourself a bargain rather than the expensive hard copy book (I have the entire library of these books)."
1,Very disappointed in the book for the price.,I think the book is over priced. I expected more recipes. I am returning it.
5,Not Just a Yoga Book!!,"A Woman's Book of Yoga isn't just another yoga book. It's an amazing, insighful, meaningful guide to health, well-being and happiness for women in all phases of life. As a yoga student I found the photos and instructions easy to understand and follow. (I loved the photos of women of different ages and body types that were used to illustrate the yoga postures.) This book simply and elegantly offers methods of dealing with life issues such as diet, stress management, sexual relations, menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause. Also whatever philosophical, religious or spiritual path the reader is on, this book has something for everyone.A Woman's Book of Yoga isn't just a guide for women either. Men should read it to get a better insight into women. Much of the content is applicable to men as well. Which brings me to a question for the authors, Seibel and Khalsa, where is the companion volume for men? I hope it's in the works!"
5,"Beautiful, Extremely Insightful","This book is beautifully written, and easy to follow. Touches upon some great topics pertaining to woman's health and overall enlightenment. A must read! Something I will keep forever, and revert back to."
4,"Nice enough for work, cool enough for play","I'm very happy with the watch, it seems well constructed and the design is very cool. It fits in with business clothes but also is 'cool' enough to wear with casual clothes. The metal clasp and around the watch face is dark, almost a gunmetal color, which is nice if you are like me and don't like shiny, flashy metals."
3,Montage Film Industry Contact List Bug,"I'd like to give this screenplay writing software a perfect 5-Star review, but it has a bug that limits its use once your screenplay is ready to start making ""contact"" with the film industry. It's supposed to download a list of industry contacts, including email addresses. This feature doesn't work and Mariner is unresponsive in getting it fixed. The screenplay writing features are otherwise pretty cool and function intuitively as advertised. I'd sure like to have that contact list, though."
1,Unexpectedly quits,"This software is garbage, at least for the latest version of Lion. Several times now, in the midst of a project, I have lost half a page or so of work because this software keeps crashing. What a piece of junk. If you don't save after every letter, you will probably loose a lot of what you do. I can't think of a single writer who appreciates having to re-write because their software is unreliable. Mariner, you have lost my business."
5,marinco 12vpk works great!!,easy installation and it works flawlessly!!! i put it on my motorcycle to run my gps and couldn't be happier.
3,Beginners Only,"If I knew nothing about chess, then this would be an excellent tool to learn basic moves and rules of the games. However, I was mistaken in the level of chess instruction that this tape offered. The expectation of a slightly higher level of chess instruction left me disappointed. I would suggest that you only buy this tape if the viewer of it will know nothing about chess before viewing; otherwise, disappointment and boredom will be the result."
5,Excellent Resource,"Last Fall I used this video to help teach chess to a group of kids in a poor community rural Louisiana. Several took an interest in this video and began to play chess among themselves. The video is a quality production and lacks the cheesy camera work, bad sound, and stiff presenters so common to instructional videos. Overall this is a great example of education via video."
2,Disappointed with the lack of pictures,"To be fair, I have not attempted any recipes in this book, but after going through it, I am very disappointed by the lack of pictures. I like my cookbooks to have a picture of each recipe so I can see what I am making and to ensure that the results are as intended. This book has some pretty complex sounding recipes (such as making birds out of chocolate) with no pictures to give you an idea what your finished product is supposed to look like. In my opinion there are many other chocolate cookbooks out there with the same types of recipes that do give you pictures of most every recipe."
5,The art of chocolate,"Love the book, is full of easy to follow techniques and good recipes, a good addition to a chocolate lover library."
1,Incredible but I would appreciate explanation,"Like many thousands of Morse's fan,I like the TV serie very much. I bought 2 of the 6 volumes set of VHS .The video and sound is very good , but there is a big problemI have , and I do not know if my fault, or problem with theVHS editions: the problem is that they are withoutclosed caption!!!!!I tried before buying to find specs in the Amazon view;but not finding information about that, I assume theyshould have closed caption, like almost any TV programThanking in advance to anyone that advices when VHS..with closed caption.. are available. ThanksA Morse fan"
5,Excellent Cookbook,"I use this cookbook all the time and have many favorites from it. In many cookbooks I find that I only like a few of the recipes, but this one has many excellent recipes. You can see some of the ones I've made on my food blog, http://fruittart.wordpress.com"
5,John Carpenter rules!!!,"One of my old time favorites! Rusell's most intense interpretation of a character on the silver screen. I read the original story ""Who goes there?"", and I imagened Kurt as Mac. He lived that character, and the work of Carpenter is exquisite. I felt chills during all the ... flick!!! It's the perfect movie. No flaws. You gotta see it, folks!With the THX sound technology, the fear factor increased! If you wanna get scared, turn off the lights, and pump up the volume! Enjoy!!!"
1,Watch the original 1951 version.,"I remember when I first watched the original version when I was about five years old. My brother and I both came off the couch several times in the course of the film, so when I heard that a re-make of the movie was going to hit the Silver Screen again, I was first in line. Needless to say all the suspense of the 1951 version was gone, being replaced by special effects in the form of a multitude of transforming creatures. Get the original version, it does come in a colorized addition and watch a true classic."
3,Hitch Adaptor,"Works OK, only problem is that it does not fit ""tightly"" into my 2"" receiver, so when I turn corners with bikes on my rack, they swing from side to side moreso than I'd like them to."
2,Very Loose Fit,It is a very loose fit. I'm going to have to shim it to keep it from moving a lot. This is a very poor design - try a different brand.
4,In-depth look at the business of the Great Northern,"A meticulous and scholarly history of the Great Northern, from its Minnesota origins in the 1850s, to the turn-of-the-century Empire Building decades under James. J. Hill, to the 1970 merger with the Northern Pacific that created the Burlington Northern. Well illustrated with vintage black and white photos, this book--at 360 pages--is nonetheless more of a business case study than a pretty coffee table book, reflecting the Harvard Business School connections of its authors and publisher."
2,Railway Decendant,"This book is a rather dry account of the financial conditions and a listing of the upper administration of the GNR. It would have been more interesting if it contained more information about the human side of the railway--that is its interactions with its various employees; e.g. the engineers, conductors, trainmen, middle managers."
4,Insightful Comparison Between Then and Now,"It was refreshing to see that there are some ""people of color"" who see things as they really are. Too many ethic groups (including blacks) are being led like sheep for political power of the elites. I hope these (black) leaders can have a positive impact on the rest of their race to become people who stand on principles."
4,Could Have Condensed Content,"Answered a lot of my questions about why the Democrat Party dominates the black voter bloc in the US. Very interesting stuff but somewhat repetitive. That being said, I would strongly recommend this film to anyone interested in race and politics in America. Early in his tenure as Attorney General, Eric Holder was quoted as saying that America has displayed cowardice in regard to discussing the race problems we face. OK, let's have the discussion! I would love to debate AG Holder regarding the thesis of Runaway Slave."
4,very Edaucational,"Everyone should watch this movie, and should be covered by all major networks. It is amazing how our history has been rewritten by the progressive. And why do you think it has been? Watch and learn!"
5,For everyone,I did not expect the reaction I had watching this movie. It brought tears to my eyes. Someone felt the same way I did! I will do my best to share it and hope others do the same. EVERYONE that should see it. I thought it was excellently done and in a manner that can be understood.
5,Amazing documentary!!,This is by far the best documentary that I have personally ever seen. I feel it is one for the history books as it is capable of making amazing changes in our country. Every single person should watch this film.
5,Wake up America! RUNAWAY FROM TYRANNY!,Well done Rev. Bryant. A much overdue dialog that ALL AMERICANS need to participate in.May we NEVER STOP FIGHTING TYRANNY IN ANY FORM.5.stars might not be enough.
5,An All-American Experience,This is an excellent movie. It is filled with new information and develops a common sense perspective that should be adopted by all of us.
5,Uplifting,My wife and I watched this last night. The truth will set you free. I highly recommend it and i hope many of the contributors are embraced by their community!
1,not what it used to be,"I Started buying this for my husband for 30 years and a bottle would last a long time because it was strong smelling a little went a long way and once on the smell lasted nicely all day.I was able to get it locally up until a couple years ago. Then my Mother in law found it in one the catalogs you get in the mail. She paid $40 for 4 oz and we were surprised when we received it it was in the wrong bottle it was in a Royall Lyme bottle and had very little smell. So I thought that I would try Amazon and see it if it was a fluke . Received it today and again its in the wrong bottle and hardly smell it, this is not amazons fault. But the company that bottled it have changed the formula this is a real disappointment."
2,Made in USA - Not From Bermuda,"This item is made by Royall Fragrances in USA under license. The original Royall Spyce is still made in Bermuda by the company Royall Lyme. This item is not the same as authentic Royall Spyce from Bermuda.I just finished my old bottle (that was made in Bermuda) and opened the new one I had purchased from this listing. This one does NOT smell the same to me, and that is probably why some reviewers say that it is not what it used to be and smells different.The listing should disclose that the item is made in USA.I am going elsewhere to buy the real thing from Bermuda, which will run about $50 but is well worth the additional cost to get the original scent."
3,Good Smell..Royall Lyme is better,"This stuff has a pretty good scent. Kind of like Old Spice if you used real ingredients instead of the fake chemicals they use to get the smells. Personally I prefer the scent of the Royall Lyme...that stuff sticks w/ you all day (in a good way) and smells wonderful. If you are looking for a specialty aftershave, give both of these great scents a try."
3,Beware,"Ordered four bottles, the first isn't like what I'm use to having in this product. When I splashed this on my face after shaving the burning was more intense than usual and it did not stop burning for tem minutes....this has never happened before with this product. I open another just to check and the second bottle is great doesn't burn for ten minutes and works like it always has. The first bottle has been mixed incorrectly somehow and is not going to be used. So I would have to say the product is not as advertised and not the same."
3,Not like it use to be.,I have been using Royall Spice for 15+ years and love it. However...this new batch is not as spicy and does not last nearly as long. I have a few remaining ounces left from an older 8oz. bottle so I was able to do a honest comparison. My guess is Royall reduced the amount of clove and added more alcohol. It's still a good fragrance but not like before. Frankly I would rather pay more to have the great scent and the longevity of the classic. Another fine product to go down hill for profit sake.
5,A GREAT BUY!,"This book is an excellent buy! This proves to be worthy of purchase simply for the practical, useful advice for Internet marketers. Ted has outdone himself with this book! A great read and MUST HAVE advice for all Internet marketers...or those who want to be successful on the Internet."
5,Wonderful messages & melodies!,"All kids should have this CD that makes learning to love the environment fun!A special note for CYNDI LAUPER or THE HOOTERS fans: They sing the eponymous track with as much zydeco style and substance as they can muster!For more of Cyndi's work in the Zydeco genre, check out 2004's romping compilation ""Creole Bred."""
4,Great for just a few uses,"The whole idea behind an inexpensive lock boring jig is that you (an amateur) use it once or twice and then throw it away. I got this jig because I wanted to add a dead bolt lock to a side door. I got the door drilled out in about 15 minutes, and even with some minor wiggle and the hole not being perfect, it still worked great and the lockset covers up any errors, though I did not end up with any.This is a good tool for any DIYer who has a general idea of what they are doing."
1,doesn't work,"This is mostly plastic and wiggles way too much - the hole saw caught on the first door I tried, and walked away from where it should have been. The centering function on the end of the door is poor as well. I threw mine in the trash. Look on ebay - you can find old models (From other manufacturers) that were made from metal."
4,An oldie but a goldie,Straight forward basic turn based game but I love it ... just wish I could play it on my new computers.
5,"It's not magic, just good horsemanship!","When I started riding, I asked an old cowboy to teach me to ride. He told me, ""Keep one leg on each side of the saddle, and you stay in the middle"". Lesson over!In those days you forced a horse into submission. They had to be BROKE.Anderson teaches how to listen to your horse, and understand what they're trying to tell you. Instead of making them, you make it possible for them to want to.Oh! There's alot on teaching your horse to be repectful, and keep yourself safe. Remember more folks are killed, or injuried by horses than any other animal.If you want to be able to have a conversation with your horse,and become a bettr rider buy the book it's worth it!Ride safe pard ............"
2,Videos (DVDs) are better,"I'll admit that I actually purchased this book at a show where Clinton was giving a demo. I had purchase several of his videos (before DVD's were the norm) and they were so good that I was able to start my 2-year old myself. His videos were very well done and easy to follow. However, the book is just a basic overview of what takes hours and regular practice to accomplish. Unless you already know what you're doing (and then you probably wouldn't need this book in the first place), I would not recommend this book to anyone as a useful tool in working with horses. Get one of his DVDs instead."
4,Good tool,Clinton's instructions are well described and easy to follow. His method seems straightforward (i dont have a personal horse to try them on). I liked the advice from the two riders he was working with - it was nice to get their input.
5,It works,I bought this for my brother who has not ever trained a horse before. He LOVED it and told me it was the best gift he got for Christmas this year. He is using the techniques and says it is easy to apply the concepts in real life and that they actually work!
4,easy to understand groundwork,"Clinton Anderson has a way of making things easy to follow and explains the reasoning behind the ground work that he does. I like his no nonsense approach in working with horses. He takes you step by step through the lesson, answers what if questions, and talks you through other problems that may arise from the horse and the person working with it. I found his book to be simple, easy to understand, and once you get the hang of the basic concepts of what you're working towards, quite effective."
5,Love this book!,"Clinton's instructions are very easy to follow and the tips from the two horse owners are very helpful. I am new with horses so not only am I training the horse, I am having to learn at the same time. Clinton's methods work and provide me with a step by step progression of how to train my horse."
5,Great book,The book is very easy to read and Clinton's techniques and principles for horsemanship are very useful to deal with horses.
3,Horsemanship,"Clinton is great with horses, I just didn't like the way the book was set up. He has some great videos, better than the book."
5,Good job Clinton!,My trainer suggested Clinton Anderson's book and it has really been very helpful for me. He is very clear in his instructions and possible problems one may encounter with various horses and issues.
5,LOVED THIS BOOK,"This book does a great job explaining simple concepts that - even being a horse person my whole life - I would never have thought of. I haven't finished learning all the exercises, but the book has already made a big difference for me and my green horse!"
5,I LOVE CLINTON!,"This is a great book with many exercises in it that you can do with your horse using his ""Method"". Clinton Anderson is always the source I turn to for all horse training issues."
5,Excellent horse training book,This is a very clearly written book with many illustrative pictures. The non-professional horse owners that Clinton use to show how his techniques work for real people serve well to show the effectiveness of his method.
5,Amazing debut album!!!,"Seriously, these guys were like 16 years old when they recorded this! One of the best debut albums I've ever heard. One of the only CD's that I can consistently keep coming back to over and over, and never get sick of.Truly AMAZING song writing capabilities. Their newest album, ""Entitlement"" is even better, check it out!"
2,Two Stars for the fact that I liked there old demo...,"My friend and I had been waiting for these guys to come out with a full length CD for a very long time. We rushed over to tower records and grabbed ourselves two copies. I'm sorry it just let me down. I was really disspaointed. The songs all sound the same and nothing sticks out in my mind as a musical accomplishment. Sorry guys, I just dont like this record. Buy Houston Calls.. that CD is amazing.<3ME"
4,Always on Cable,"These three movies are relentlessly on American Movie Classics on cable. As if AMC only has the license to show these, as opposed to the vast amount of Hammer films, which are infinitely better. Asylum and Now the Screaming ..., are good, not great."
1,Misleading photo,"Other brush rod kits just show the rods. This one shows the picture of the brush attached, which it doesn't include as part of the ""kit."" Definitely returning."
1,does not look the same,"I just got the hand mit and foot mit. They are very cheap looking. They do not look at all like the picture of the product. Would not buy this, if I had known."
5,Great Book,This book is a must for anybody interested in using Stata to examine categorical and limited dependent variable regression models. I've been keeping this book within an arm's length while writing programs and estimating models for my dissertation and it's been extremely helpful.
1,Misleading and Shallow,"Rarely does an author trash his own title. This book is well written and concise, but misleading on many levels. There are nine essays in this slim volume, and only one is on topic. On page 131, the author finally warms to the alleged subject. There he breathlessly informs us that ""The cause of the Civil War"" is a poor question. The causes of the war are many and nuanced. He has discovered something called ""deep contingency"". In other words, one thing leads to another. Yes, quite.This is a fascinating and important subject. The war was fought between two constitutional democracies. It was staggeringly bloody and vindictive. The issues leading up to it had been in contention for centuries. Why and how did this war happen? This text panders to the usual suspects, and adds nothing."
1,About as interesting as my grocery list...,"""I was born in the South, BUT I went to Yale, okay? Okay? Do you respect me now?"" Really bad book, does not live up to its title. Author is in love with nuance (""On the one hand this, on the other hand that, but let's not forget...and then there's...but really, in the end, it's hard to assign a single..."" Yawn. This book is a pastiche of essays on miscellaneous topics, and the one on computerizing historical research is particularly tedious. Only one short essay talks about the causes of the Civil War and it comes to no conclusion at all. Also, who but a pretentious academic would start a chapter with ""On The Simpsons, a popular animated satire of American life, ..."". Like you never watched it, prof? This from a guy so provincial that he is amazed to find a McDonalds in the Netherlands.Avoid."
1,Abraham Lincoln caused the Civil War,"Folks, I feel compelled to sumit some ""comments"" regarding this topic since I have read a number of books about Abraham Lincoln. I have NOT read this book and probably never will based upon the negative reviews provided so far on this web site.I now believe that Abraham Lincoln was the worst president the US ever elected. He used the ""slavery"" issue as his political platform to gain the office and thus ""led"" the country into a Civil War which accomplished nothing but killing thousands of Americans in the North and South.Slavery was already on the way out in this country and we didn't need to fight a war to put the blacks out of work with no re-employment plans. A problem that still haunts the US today....."
3,Interesting Academic Question,This book is interesting for academics only. It is a good discussion as to where civil war literature needs to go in the future. It is a reflection on why the southern perspective in the war has not been undertaken and it outlines Ayers efforts to develop this history further. The title DOES NOT REFELCT what is in the book. Overall though for academics of the civil war this really is a must read.
5,Asking the hard questions,"A few years ago I read Ayers' book, ""In the Presence of Mine Enemies,"" and was deeply impressed by his learned refusal to bow to the prevailing orthodoxy of what this war was about. ""What Caused the Civil War?"" takes up that theme again, though in more compressed essays. In the one on ""Worrying "" about the War, Ayers takes us off the grand boulevard of easy explanation, and shows us the little side roads, crooked lanes and byways that we hadn't glimpsed before. Some of the reviewers complain that the title is misleading. It is, but only if you're looking for a ready-to-wear answer. If you're looking for something more intricate, that gets you actually thinking and appreciating how difficult the question really is, you could do far, far worse. Judged by that standard, the book earns 5 stars."
4,I liked this book,"If you read it you will come away with insights on Reconstruction and the impossible century plus arrogance of our Northern friends.Dr. Ayers touches on some verboten topics, way out of the mainstream of standard knee jerk explanations for the Civil War. He doesn't hit you over the head with it, but it's there.As for the admittedly tedious essay on his digital endeavors, don't read it if you aren't interested in computers. Historians in the future will read it and understand Dr. Ayers as one of the pioneers in digitizing historical source documents.(PS - For what it is worth, my name is Ned Foster. My wife Lynn, who has the log-in/password info., has nothing to do with this short post)."
4,This for that,"I have read this book and I have used some of the recipes and substitutions for years. The heading "" when your out of..."" is easy to understand, such as if your out of eggs, milk and shortening you can still prepare a dessert that will taste good; such as the spicy mayonnaise cake. Don't judge. It is good! This is a book for those who are in a tuff spot and short on time; can't get to the store in time or tight on money until the next payday; and you need a replacement that will make your dinner or dessert taste good.I will always keep an updated version of this book; especially one that makes updates using a microwave."
5,Radical Happiness,"With its simple suggestions and exercises Gina Lake's book, Radical Happiness, enables the reader to easily drop into the experience of an awakened life, perhaps never to return to the egoic state of consciousness. Its hopeful message is that our natural state is available to us whenever we place our attention there rather than on the contents of the mind. I wholeheartedly recommend this book for seekers who have tired of the search and are ready to become finders. If I had read Radical Happiness without knowing who authored it, I could have readily attributed it to Eckhart Tolle. In the genre of books on self-realization, it stands unmatched."
2,glad I only paid 3 bucks,"It is obvious that the author writes from a place of knowledge and some personal insight but what doesn't come across is a knowingness of the truly Transpersonal. Some sentences appeared to be almost direct quotes from Adyashanti videos on Youtube but I cant be sure without wasting a lot of my time. The book contradicts itself from one section to another without clarifying how opposing statements are actually compatible (perhaps they are not). Mooji and Adya both have a large number of free materials. use those. Not hand me down explainations. It may not seem so but IMO this little book is chock full of to-dos for the ""seeker""."
4,Exceptional Insights,Love this book and the spiritual teachings are very helpful.. The book however did not download properly to my Kindle Fire and there are pages and the whole of chapter 3 missing. Hoping to get this corrected but so far have not found a way to do so. HELP
4,Great taste while it lasts,I hear this is the issue with most xylitol gum. It's got a nice taste but it fades super fast.I did fine another brand of xylitol gum made by Xyloburst that lasts longer and I bought a bottle of 500 pieces at a reasonable price.
4,The Kids Like It,"I bought this gum because I was looking for something for my kids that is sweetened only with xylitol, no artificial sweeteners. We also try to avoid mint since we use homeopathic remedies, so we tried the fruit flavor. My kids like it. It actually does taste more refreshing than I expected and I suspected it may have some mint it it but when I called the manufacturer, they confirmed that there is no mint. On the downside, it's a little pricey and I wish I could get a larger quantity packaged in a paper bag or something instead of a little plastic tub that I keep having to throw in the trash."
2,Not very useful,"I'm not interested in reading this book from cover to cover, but there isn't any other way to get information out of it.1 - The table of contents doesn't list the chapter subsections, making it hard to figure out what chapter contains the information I want.2 - No table of cases! Every law reference book should have one - there's no excuse for it being missing.3 - Pathetic index - only 2 pages long. I almost never found what I was looking for.If you are interested in reading the entire book front to back, it might be useful. If you want to read a bit at a time to supplement your casebook as you go through the semester, you will be frustrated."
2,Below Standard,"I love the Examples and Explanations series. The book on Civ Pro was perfect. The Contracts book was very good. This book disappoints because it doesn't provide explanations.This edition refers students in almost every paragraph to look up a portion of the UCC or refer to a statute or case. Instead of explaining Sales and Leases, this editions tells us on every page to look at a provision of the UCC and discover the truth for ourselves. It might be fine as a supplement to online law school, but given the huge amounts of text law students have to read, it is almost useless as a concise explanation of the subject."
3,It's okay but frustrating at times,"This E&E; provides good, clear discussions of UCC Article 2 provisions. It would be a five-star product if it wern't for one fundamental problem:The answers are long, rambly, and not very straightforward. Most of the examples call for short answers, usually a ""yes"" or a ""no."" For an explanation, you get about a page-and-a-half of reasoning and NO CLEAR ANSWER so you have no idea if you're right or wrong.That defeats the purpose of getting an E&E; in the first place.However, the discussions that precede the questions are quite clear and useful, and that's what saves this book from getting only two stars.I see there is a new version coming out in March 2009. I hope that this will be improved in the new version."
3,Very interesting and refreshing,"I found this album in the used bin at a record store and decided to pick it up. At first I was put off by her voice and ""strange"" music, but I have grown to love this album. This is the only Kate Bush album I own but I will definately check out her other albums. This album is perfect for any Kate fan or for anyone who wants to listen to something different and refreshing."
4,Kate Bush -- More Direct Than She Typically Is,"While still her quirky self, Kate used simpler orchestration and more accessible lyrics on this one. The results are not as awe-inspiring as, say, ""The Dreaming"" or ""Hounds of Love,"" but it does give some wrenching and beautiful moments -- e.g. the pain of breaking up (""You're the One"") and bittersweet memories (""Moments of Pleasure"")."
2,Very disappointing after a long wait,"This album is very weak, perhaps even more so than Lionheart. There is one excellent, truly ""Kate Bush"" song (Moments of Pleasure), a couple of OK songs (Eat the Music, You're the One) but rest of the songs are uninteresting and the album doens't hang together. It appears that Kate wanted to break out of her insularity and bring in some folks from the real world (Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Prince) but their presence is intrusive and detracts from her magic. The Prince collaboration would make a decent Prince song but is a mediocre Kate Bush song. The entire album has a profoundly unsatisfying feel to it. For hardcore fans only, and even then just buy it for Moments of Pleasure and to complete your collection."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"First of all I think Kate Bush is a great talent. However, this album is definitely not one of her best. The production tricks and musical layering (does this make sense?) that made albums like Hounds of Love and The Dreaming so amazing, just seem overdone and pointless on some of these songs -- like for example Big Stripey Lie. However, there are some stand out tracks -- Eat The Music and the Red Shoes are very fun and danceable, Song of Solomon is beautiful, and Lily comes close as the song that scares me the second most (after Waking the Witch), some songs like Constellation of the Heart and Top of the City took a while to grow on me, and a few I could do without. I still think this album is worth buying, especially for a Kate fan, but it doesn't come close to her earlier work."
1,Sorry; but this is a really bad album,"Kate Bush has produced much glorious music but The Red Shoes isn't one of those efforts. What's the problem(s)? Boring drum machines; uninspired singing; uninteresting songs. Sounds like a bunch of misshappen outtakes from Hounds of Love. Rubberband Girl is almost listenable, but the droning monotone drum machine kills any flexible sparkle it had. Sorry, Kate.I'm writing this to save you from buying this album. Don't. Here's what you should own instead: The Kick Inside, Lionheart, The Dreaming, Never For Ever."
2,Her least impressive effort,"If I wanted to listen to Prince, I would. It's so strange to hear a Prince album from Kate Bush. So many of these songs sound like she's trying to sound ""produced"". I'm a fan of Kate's as much as the next critic on this site. But to love this album compared to the others is almost delusional. It doesn't hold up."
5,1 of her Best,"The Red Shoes"" was a huge pleasant surprise. I really like ""The Sensual World"". But I love the concept of this album along with the beautiful lyrics & lilting voice. It all ties together. I think it's her most fluid album to date. Kate's been accused of having childish lyrics. These aren't child-like. They're smart & sometimes her music comes off to people as easy & simple. Easy, simple, brilliant, lyrical, lovely, & entrancing sometimes come together. Kate Bush brings all that together with The Red Shoes. If you ever get the chance to see her video of this, ""The Line, The Cross, & The Curve"" Do It. The few videos in it really come together for a great short story."
1,Kate Should Stay Away From Pop's Influence,"Although this cd was disappointing she still can salvage her magic. It isn't lost too much. There are some nice fun songs like Rubberband Girl but has a definite Cheese factor that drags u through the whole album. If it was just her voice without the overrated guitar riffs and tribal mumblings this album would have been superb. Their are some great lyrics like poetry in songs like The Song of Solomon, and the subject is good in Eat The Music (which would have been a good sog with just her voice), but the whole album seems plastic. I love all of Kate's records previous to this one and I am a big fan but so far this cd just stands as completing my collection. Maybe it takes some growing to but it never was like that with Kates other albums. Whoever looked for meaning in Kate's music or just her input shouldn't buy this album."
4,COCAINE LIP GLOSS EXPLOSION IN YOUR BRAIN,"You know what you get when you put KATE BUSH, TORI AMOS, JONI MITCHELL, CAROLE KING and FIONA APPLE in your CD-player at once. One helluva nice jumbo pack of sirens. I love Tori's music and I heard that Kate Bush, who came before here, was an inspiration. You bet! Kate rocks this house down. Quircky, playful, loving, sensual, biting and down right acid-trippy, this album is not only quintessential ""lesbian suicide"" music (you know, the personal sturn und drang) but a ride to ether world just on the other side of the galazy. Nice work."
5,Red Shoes -Kate Bush,This was an international transaction and the CD arrived very quickly and was very well packed. Very efficient service. Great CD! Thanks.
1,Buy ANY Kate Bush Disc but this one.,"Sorry, but I can't let this disc get by with four and five star reviews. Don't buy it. I bought it used for about half the new price and I traded it back in. I love Kate Bush and I have all her other albums on vinyl or CD, but this one barely deserves one star. Buy ""The Dreaming,"" ""Never Forever,"" ""Hounds of Love,"" ""Lionheart,"" ""The Kick Inside"" or even ""The Sensual World,"" but definitely not this one."
2,Her only disappointing release,"I am so accustomed to raving about Kate Bush's recordings that it really pains me to write this one. This CD, while not horrible, is very disappointing. It seems she got sick of making interesting, quirky music and decided to just make some money with this one. It is very commercial, ridiculously over-produced and just could not have come from her heart. If you are a fan, you already own this. If you are looking for an introduction to Kate's music, buy ""Hounds of Love"". That CD is her masterpiece; ""Red Shoes"" should be veiwed as an asterisk in her amazing career."
3,it's hard to tell....,"It's really hard for me to write a review on this album! I ownend it when I was in my early 20's and remember being fascinated with Kate Bush and fanatical about all of her works. Admittedly, I still am. The difficutly with reviewing this album comes from the fact that I'm not able to owing to the pathetic condition the disc was in when it arrived. The seller of the item rated it Very Good when in all honesty it's Very Bad (the disc, not the album, I mean)."
1,Kate's low point,"Let me start off by saying that Kate is among my favorite female artists and has released some of the most daring and expressive material throughout her career. Sadly this doesn't have any. It seems like she's trying become more commercially accessable while still remaining Kate (""The Sensual World"" was more daring). The songs are uninspired and the collaberations fall flat (""Why Should I Love You?"" springs to mind). The only interesting track is ""White Stripey Lie"" where she plays a rather twisted guitar solo (pretty good for a pianist).Kate is at her best when she takes risks and challenges her audience (I'm talking ""The Dreaming"" and ""The Hounds Of Love""). The only challenge to ""The Red Shoes"" is how long it takes you to hit the eject button.If this CD was released by someone like... Oh... Pat Benetar, it would be considered an artistic triumph. But as it is we don't expect much of her. We do have a right to expect more of Kate Bush... Much more."
4,Another eclectic shock from Kate Bush.,"With an opener like Rubberband Girl, nobody can help sitting up and taking notice. A Kate rock song at it's best, in total contrast to the gorgeous Moments of Pleasure, a worthy bookend to Wuthering Heights, and Top of the City. Her Irish influences appear again in the title song, reminiscent of Jig of Life from Hounds of Love, and the artist formerly known as Prince makes a wonderful appearance on Why Should I Love You?, a perfect choice for the song, not to mention Nigel Kennedy on Big Stripey Lie and Top of the City. Other stand-out tracks include The Song of Solomon, with the Trio Bulgarka making another appearance and Lily, with a haunting opening narration. If music be the food of love, eat the music!"

1,Foot Scrub,"Not what I thought it would be, way to soft, not hard enough for feet. More of a hand scrubber. I would not reccomend this product."
2,poly panels,seem to be just stirafoam was a little disapointed but for the price I will use them any way thank you
2,Babor classic lip pencil in Mauve,"I was not happy with this product. It came fairly quickly, but, I was not happy with the color. That's what you get when you order makeup online, I suppose. :( The reviews were pretty good, so I thought I was safe. The color, had an orange tint to it, which I would not associate ""mauve"" with. It gave my teeth a sort of yellow tint. :( Plus, the color was not very vibrant, or even noticable at all, really. It was a very ""matronly"" color. I think that a lip pencil should both outline and compliment your lips. It didn't define my lips at all. They looked sort of ""messy"". Now, it will go in the garbagae, since, it probably won't be worth sending back."
1,"mundane, borring","This type of book is so rediculous to users who just start learning java.I really don't recommand it because you might find this so hard and borring even from the begining. I am using this stupid book in my class. Without teacher's direction, I couldn't even understand what the hack is going on on the book.In another word, don't buy this stupid item. authors whom made this are bunch of dumbers"
2,I didn't care too finish this book,I felt I wasted my money buying it. Wasn't that exciting and they barely paid much attention to Miller who was the gymnast that really won them the gold since she was the highest scorer on the team. Don't buy it.
5,Quality Product,Solid construction and easy to install. Provides choices for wire entry making a change out go quickly. You can use either a standard or quick connect lock ring.quality
5,Lovely book,Karla's books are so pretty. I love her illustrations as well as what she writes. The books make really nice gifts.
4,Worked on my small convertible top,I see that some reviewers stated this is a very small brush and takes a long time to use on larger spaces. That is true. For my application however it performed well. I have a small 2 door convertible and I was able to scrub the top in under 10 minutes ... Quality is great for the price and only a few bristles came out (to be expected)
4,simple & sweet,"Adults & children alike can relate to a child losing a cherished toy, which is what happens when Ernest & Celestine go for a walk in the snow, & Celestine inadvertently drops her stuffed bird, Gideon. Ernest buys an assortment of appealing substitutes, but none is adequate. Ernest meticulously recreates Gideon from Celestine's vivid recollection, resulting in the perfect happy Christmas gift. This story was appealing to me & my 7 yr old daughter entering 2nd grade. She has played countless hrs w/various special dolls & stuffed animals. Countless times I have been called upon, not to recreate lost favorites, but to mend damage, or create new costumes, etc. Gabrielle Vincent's Ernest & Celestine series is appealing for the endearing young & old characters, the relationship between them, & the simplicity of the tales. The illustrations come alive."
3,Decent but not great...,"I honestly didn't know what to expect from this book as I didn't know anything about African music. The music itself is very upbeat and with a quick tempo. My beef is with the lack of depth of the music (as it only covers a handful of styles) and the audio on the CD is midi instead of guitar (which seems odd considering the title).I've used a few of the ideas and incorporated them into my own music, so for that fact alone the book is worth looking at but I don't know if I'd pay full price for it."
1,BEWARE the audio CD with this product,"Alas, while the text has great examples, the audio CD is totally worthless. The guitar music is demo'd with programmed keyboard samples. Where and how the notes are played on the guitar is just as important as the pitch and rhythm values of the notes. So instead of hearing a guitar playing music, you get cheesy keyboard demos that lack the most important element of music in guitar."
3,The book reads easily but has several problems.,"Revisionist biographies continue to poke through the well turned turf of the nineteenth century like brightly colored weeds. No one can deny their freshness; yet for all their vigor and excitement, they are still weeds. They serve only their own purpose. Mary Lovell writes and researches well. She has created her Richard Burton to evoke our sympathy. It's a shame there's any need for this at all. Larger than life individuals like Richard Burton don't need our sympathy. It's a waste of water on a superbly toughened desert shrub. She believes we want our legends (and he is one) pruned and prettified, ready for admiration or, oddly emulation. What we admire about Burton are the vigor of his intellect, and the physical endurance to satisfy an extraordinary curiosity about the world. He doesn't need softening or explanation. It takes a hard man to push his way into history. That is enough."
4,I liked it!,"A comprehensive story of an incredible man, his controversial wife and their relationship, and a revealing glimpse of Victorian society. What a remarkably talented man! There are so many great stories-within-stories in his complex life, it is just amazing to me that most Americans regard Richard Burton the actor as the famous one. The book would benefit from more maps and more pictures, and maybe a chapter on how his work influenced others, such as T.E. Lawerence. For an entertaining fictional account of African explorations, pick up T.C. Boyle's ""Water Music"""
1,A Rage to Live:A Biography of Richard and Isabel Burton,"I never received the book, instead I received 1000 Restaurant, Bar & Cafe Graphics. Disappointed with this service, My first time to receive wrong material."
4,None,"Excellent/Complete book, greatly written.Hard to put it down once you have began reading it.I would recommend it to everyone.I have actually ordered a few of Sir Burton's books after reading this as he was such an interesting man."
1,Mama grizzlies explained,"One would think from this sort of awful offal that men are not a gender but a conspiracy. Is it really necessary to explain why people with wombs might think that these wombs serve some purpose other than providing abortionists with something to abort? She talks about Republican women. Hey, why not explain why Natalie Clifford Barney supported Mussolini, or why Eva Braun married Hitler, or why Ingrid Rimland married Ernst Zundel (the holocaust denier)? How about Nesta Webster? The list is a long one. Didn't Attila the Hun and Genghis Khan have wives? Talk about right-wing women! But I think that what Dworkin is really getting at is that any woman who isn't a pinko radical is a traitor to her gender."
2,"Sadly, a disappointment","I very much wanted to like this book, but it was so undisciplined! Andrea does not pay enough attention to the facts, and she lets her emotions run her life for her. I think she should have paid more attention to her teachers in school!"
4,Defying Logic...the Kindle way,"I love my kindle, it goes everywhere with me. And I am a person who rereads series I love often. So I was disappointed that the Blood series was not available on Kindle and click the little button to put in my ""request"" for it to go to Kindle. But WHY oh WHY are they charging 7.99 for an electronic copy when you can get TWO books in a single paperbook format for 8.99?? I mean seriously, with a paperback you need paper, ink, a physical building to create the books, a trucking delivery service to ship the books plus all the folks that involves. An electronic version, you make ONE single copy of the appropriate format and send it out on the internet, how can that POSSIBLY be equal costs? Boooooooo once again on the overpricing of Kindle version!!!!"
4,Very good,"This is the first in the series featuring Vicki, Celluci and Henry Fitzroy. I read these a little out of sequence where I read the third one first - so I will say again that it is best to read these in order. In reading Blood Price it gave me the background of the main characters and how they all met. I was not looking for a detective novel, I was looking for pure entertainment where the real world could be suspended for awhile. And I found it. I really like the three main characters and am looking forward to reading the remaining three books. Tanya Huff does a really good job at describing the many emotions and thrills in the book - from horror, fear, despair, happiness, love, desire........I think she did a great job."
3,"Interesting premise, but mostly groundwork","The storyline is different, and lightly entertaining. I wouldn't call it a page-turner, but it is a nice diversion. It also does a good job of laying the groundwork for future ""Blood"" novels."
1,"Very simplistic, no points for writing style","As someone says below, ""This is not an Anita Blake story.""Nor is it good PI narrative. Weak dialogue. The backstory of Vicky & her cop ex-boyfriend laid on the page looking cardboard. Within the first dozen pages they are re-hashing their former relationship: in public, at a crime scene, in front of other cops, bellowing ""okay, the sex was great!""Far easier to believe in vampires.Henry the vamp was potentially the most interesting character. But he felt like a historical fantasy with no masculine pulse. And his writing excerpts could have been sharper.The nerd character might have been painfully scary. One of many missed opportunities. I am puzzled that there are numerous followups in this series. Seems like a low writing standard to me."
2,Boring!,"It's rare that I don't finish something I start. I tried to force myself to finish this book, and only made it halfway through. The characters are childish, flat and unimaginative. The leading vampire is overly dramatic and silly. The plot is horribly boring. This is NOT a vampire thriller it's a cop/vampire romance novel."
4,Loved this book...,"My introduction to the series. I've read the book 3 times so far. It's a fire, hot chocolate, cloudy day kind of experience. Unfortunately, won't be able to say the same for the audible version. Listened to the sample and the readers voice just does not match the character (tough, smart, PI) for me. Not by any stretch of my imagination. That saddens me...I really wanted to listen to this one on my next long drive."
3,book ok editing bad,"Good Book, editing on my kindle version was horrible though detracting from the read. (miss spelled words and wrong words causing me to have to stop and decipher what was being said.)"
3,Typos,This story is good but I am distracted by the large number of typos! Where were the editors. This is very disappointing. Wondering if her paperbacks are riddled with typos also. I won't be buying another kindle book from this author. I see one to six typos on every page! Disgraceful! This book should be free . $8 is to much.
4,Great start to a great series,"This is the first in a series by Tanya Huff. The characters, Vicki--private investigator/ex-cop, Henry--450 year old vampire and Mike--cop and Vicki's friend/lover/ex-partner, are all introduced well, and it's off to a wonderful start. Very good book. Make sure to read the other books in the series, Blood Trail, Blood Lines, Blood Pact and Blood Debt. You won't be disappointed. :)"
3,"Not on a par with the Anita Blake series, but entertaining","Reasonably entertaining and suspenseful, but lacking in much of the detail & characterization that makes the Anita Blake novels so believable. It's not clear why Vicki, the main character, a former police detective now working as a private investigator) feels compelled to be so snarly with her on & off lover, Cellucci, nor why she is so cold to her mother (who may be boring, but still seems to be a loving mother, which ought to earn her at least a little affection from her own daughter). But Henry Fitzroy, the vamp who helps her catch the murderer in this book is a fairly interesting and compelling character. I plan to read the next in the series."
2,characters very one demensional,Vicky was not a very life like character. There seemed to be more depth in Henry the vampire than anyone else in the book. The relationship between Vicky and the other detective wasn't believable at all. I couldn't feel any connection between the two of them. This was no Anita Blake stroy.
2,The Book that Helped,"After my aunt's demise several years ago, I was the recipient of some odd pieces of old china. I wondered as to the age of the pieces, and so I went to the Internet. What do you think I found. You're right, my china was listed in the book that I purchased through Amazon.com.Thank you very much."
5,Must have for CP fans,Not only is Chris Potter a wonderful actor but he is a great singer. The music (songs) are ones that you can sing along with and also a few love songs in the mix too.
2,Book is good but poor image resolution on Kindle,"This is very good hiking guide book. We are looking for hiking course for our 4 years old son. It categorized difficulty and easy to find hiking course for each level. We are very happy with it contents. I would give 4 or 5 stars for paper version.Problem we have is image resolution on Kindle. We bought Kindle edition and resolution of map is too low. It is hard to read letters in the map. Be aware, Image you see in preview is from paper book not from Kindle. Kindle book doesn't have resolution of preview image. Since this is hiking guide, map is very important and I wouldn't recommend kindle edition."
5,very good,"Very clear guide,but spending only few days in the aerea, I would have loved one photo for each road to figure out what you see"
4,Pretty good overview of the Teons,"This book gives a pretty good summary of the hiking trails in Grand Teton National Park. My one complaint would be regarding the trail for Granite Canyon/Rendevous mountains (Chapter 3). The elevation map showed the trail being flat at the end. You actually ascend a bit at the end. I wish I had known that before because I was pretty tired at the end. Other than that, I found the book accurate, and a a great guide to hiking in the area."
3,Beginner's only,"This book is not what I expected when I bought it. It is not for advanced users - it has some memory tips all right, but most (if not all) target the beginners (like tips on how to remember that the sequence is Club-Diamond-Heart-Spade etc).It's the only one I found in the subject, so if you want to have a completed library, you may select it. Do not expect to gain a lot from it though."
1,Disappointed with Krups product,The toaster worked fine for a week or two then the problems started. The stop button no longer worked and more frustrating was the only way to get toast out was to unplug toaster.Called Krups and they told me to send it to a repair location. Good thing I called the location first since Krups representative never told me what had to accompany the toaster when mailed to service center.Still waiting for the return of the repaired toaster.So unhappy with the product and even more unhappy with the Krups service center.Wouldn't recommend buying it.
1,charlie-cook and business owner,"the only good feature is the high lift toast lever--that's it.It doesn't toast the toast evenly or efficiently. My white bread took over two minutes, darker breads even longer. I kept it for one day and returned it. I have went through 17 toasters in 30 days in my quest for a toaster that just toasts good toast---I wanted a toaster that was made in America---no such thing anymore, China is all I found. I paid from $148.00 to $19.00 for a black and decker incinerator---I ended up on Ebay and bought a 1951 toastmaster and a 1949 sunbeam radiant ---I paid $46.00 and $63.00---they are not only pieces of work-good old fashioned chrome--they can make a wonderful piece of toast from edge to edge in under two minutes---and the mechanics are beautiful---1250 watts and it says''''MADE IN UNITED STATED AMERICA''' it gives me the chills..and the great toast warms me up--God Bless America and bring back the toaster."
2,Average Toaster,Decent looking toaster. Standard size toast does not fit properly. Toasting capabilities are ok.
3,Great Toaster Most of the Time,I bought it because of the Consumer Reports review of the lesser non-LED model. It makes great toast. I like the way it easily handles odd shaped pieces of bread.My problem is that that the toasting times do not stay the same for a given setting. Example: for setting #6 the time is sometimes 2 minutes 10 seconds and sometimes it's 1 min. 44 seconds. Of course the toast is not done in the lesser time.Maybe it's just a flaw in the unit I have. Otherwise it is just fine.
5,Beautiful,"I LOVE THESE SHOES. True sized, just right, my foot is on the wider side of medium and they are just perfect. And beautiful. Yum."
2,a bit thin,"I was a little disappointed with this product. Though the construction looks really good when you take it from the box and it has nice felt on the bottom, the material was a bit thin. The problem is that when you put it on your card table, then put your elbows on it it sags slightly. It seems like it should have been made with a more rigid material."
1,This movie has a man wearing a plastic ninja outfit.,"Seriously, this is one of the worst movies of all times. I know people say that all the time about movies but this time, it is the truth. this movie for you if you like ninjas in terrible fight scenes, bad acting, bad dialog, a plot that can only be followed if you were on crack, a lame twist at the end that really does not make sense, background music that is louder than the already to quite spoken dialog and crazy effects that really do not work. oh yeah, did i mention that the main character sells real estate by day and runs around in plastic ninja suit pretending to be from Ninja Gaiden by night? If you can sit through the whole movie, you find out there will a sequel,God help us if this is true."
1,Not worth it,"This book claims to have over 600 photos of EM - I counted, there aren't even 400, and yes, the quality of the pictures is awful in many cases. Newspaper clippings are shown, but only headlines or cut off paragraphs. I can do without these. Also, there is a lot of typos that should have been edited, some paragraphs are repeated word for word, and the bibliography is improper, just a list of magazines and other sources that the author used, and even some of them are listed twice. (...) As a long-time Elizabeth Montgomery fan, I was looking forward to a real biography on her, with new information that can't already be found on the internet - exclusive interviews with people who knew her, newly discovered facts, original reviews of her movies, etc. - things that normally make a biography worth it for fans to buy. This book is simply nothing new ... Doesn't change the fact that the book is not very good.(...)"
4,OK,"There isn't another book out there on Eliz. Montgomery's life, just the show Bewitched, so I'm grateful for the book. But it has no color pictures in the book. Some of the pictures are poor quality. Even the author apologizes for her book. Grateful for the book, but not worth the price."
4,Our Elizabeth,"Elizabeth Montgomery is one of my idols and I'd always wished someone would write her biography. Now we have one...although I wouldn't call this book a biography in the traditional sense.Elizabeth's story is told here in quotes, magazine articles and interviews previously given by Elizabeth and people who knew and worked with her. There are a great deal of interesting bits about Bewitched, especially obscure trivia that even diehard fans probably don't know, and some details about Elizabeth's ill-fated marriage to the odd actor Gig Young. This book also includes a lot of excellent photos of Elizabeth, many of which are from early in her career and before she became synoymous with Samantha.I did learn a lot about my idol in reading this book, but because Elizabeth was a very private person, there are understandably a lot of holes that may never be filled.Overall, I'm pleased with this book. True Elizabeth fans will like it too."
3,Nothing too new/interesting; poor selection of photos,"This chronicle has some interesting information I hadn't seen in other EM-related books; however, it mostly reads like a coffe table book on EM that was patched together with existing EM material.And most of the EM photographs the author chose to include, in my opinion, aren't among EM's best."
4,She kissed me is the best track here,"I remember this CD coming out in 93 and at the same time as Lenny Kravitz 'Are you gonna go my way' and TTD music on this one got overshadowed by Lenny.She kissed me may not have great lyrics, but this song doesn't let up, and a great vocal by Terence (as always!) Honestly, this CD is worth buying just for 'She kissed me', it's that good. Other highlights are 'do you love me' 'let her down easy' and 'delicate.'Last I heard about TTD was when he sang with INXS in Australia back in middle of 1999, and back in the late 80s he was even considered to be joining the Rolling Stones!I'd like to see more solo work from TTD, cause the song 'She kissed me' is as good as any song I've heard. Come back Terence!"
4,Underappreciated,"Great collection of songs, easy listen, the sequence is remarkably smooth especially T.I.T.S into Frankie and Johnny. Other highlights include ""She Kissed Me"", ""Do You Love Me Like You Say You Do"", and the unforgettable ""Let Her Down Easy"". An underappreciated collection of songs from a underappreciated artist."
4,good disc,Terence Trent D'arby is one of the Most Underrated artists.he is very Talented.great Writer&his voice is Soulful.Delicate with Des'Ree is a great Song.he is badly needed now.he can do so many styles.he is a solid Instrumentalist&Producer.his Horn charts are tight.His album titles alone deserve a Look.you can tell just by the titles that the Brother has Madd Talent.he deserves to be Heard again.
4,Another tour de force from the master,"The man is brilliant! Pay special attention to the lyrics on this album. Some true poetry. Creatively, I can't even begin to imagine how he comes up with some of his compositions. And compositions is what they truly are not just songs. The juxtapostions of instruments, rhythm and time are beyond words...There are however, a few lighter cuts so the album as a whole only rates an 8 (most performers would never even get a 7 from me) Still a definite purchase."
2,Well....,"I can't blame Mr Darby for his musical ability or his voice, but i cannot understand why we need 16 songs on this effort. So many artists fall into this trap, they put out a few good tracks while we are forced to endure 30 minutes of meandering tunes to get anywhere. Tracks like Delicate, She kissed me and castillian have an appealing mix of rock, soul and R&B, but the album is long, loose and I have difficulty staying tuned in all the way.I can understand an artists craving to be adventureous, but more than often it comes across as overblown and incohesive as is the case with this album."
2,vague and unorganized,"The statistics department of my university recommeded this book for professors to teach out of since one of the authors is a lecturer there, but since then, some of the professors have stopped using this book and moved on to better ones. This book is a terrible text book, in the sense that desciptions are very short, examples are unrepresentative of the concept, and concepts are not presented in an organized fashion. The book also lacks minor things like solutions to problems included within the text of the chapter. I had taken AP stats in High school before and the book I used then was a lot easier to understand and follow. In fact, some of the professors at the university are beginning to use it."
1,An Insult,Someone should have told the authors that simple concepts don't need to be elaborated. Insulting a student's intelligence in no way helps him to learn.
1,Derivative,"Look, it's all subjective, but to me this stuff is mostly boring and derivative. There's definitely a few killer tracks, but it's really uneven and nowhere near the level of Nuggets, Nuggets II, No Thanks, Loud Fast & Out of Control, or One Kiss Can Lead to Another..."
5,Children of nuggets review,"The previous 2 nuggets were incredible. Fortunately, the 3rd edition does not disappoint either. A treasure trove of great pop ditties and well worth the purchase price. These 3 editions are the best compilations ever."
2,BAIT AND SWITCH...,"See Fran Fried's comprehensive review for the real lowdown on this collection: he NAILS it. Calling this ""Children of Nuggets"" is highly misleading, and even the producer hedges his bet in his liner notes. Too much stuff that just doesn't belong here and too much stuff left out that should have been included. Very disappointing..."
2,Children of Nuggets is minor league comp.,"This sophomore collection holds no comparison to the more influential Nuggets collections-- Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965-1968; or Nuggets II: Original Artyfacts from the British Empire and Beyond. Those two box sets highlighted some unknown and early punk and pop rock influences and proved as influential as Harry Smith's folk collection. Not so here. I counted about an 1/8th of the songs decent, but have to ask how often will you return to these novelties? Not much."
2,A REAL RUSH JOB,"Judging by the fact that a LOT of great bands that would have actually fit the NUGGETS profile were left out and the fact that some of the bands on here were given multiple tracks,It seems this compilation was pretty much just thrown together to make money. Examples of GREAT bands that should have been on here are The Cheepskates, LORD JOHN and MOD FUN (who were very active in the 80's NYC garage scene)from NYC and the surrounding area.The list goes on but at least these bands had some great rockers as opposed to some of the sleepers included on this compilation. There is some really good stuff on here but also some not so great stuff."
5,EXCELLENT SET... if you love rock'n' roll.,"Forget the ""half-loaf"" commentary, this set of 'off the radar' progressive rock music is excellent. I've been listening to Nuggets collections since the original two record set was released in 1976. This particular collection of music from '76 to '96 is flawless in recording and content. Each cut is a hit in and of itself. If you loved college radio through the 70's, 80's and 90's, this is THE collection that brings it all back. You'll find no filler, no 'top 40' garbage, no tricks, just plenty of guitar, hooks, blues riffs, rhythm and vocals...'three chords and the truth' is what it's all about. Check out ALL the Nuggets collections, they're all really great, but there isn't enough stars for this one."
2,"Mahna-tonous, doot doo dee doo-doo!","How appropriate the set stops the canon in 1996 since those coming of age in the 1990s were concerned with not being able to live at the same standard as their parents. This does not measure up to the first Nuggets boxed set, mainly because a lot of this, isn't really all that garage-ish.If you bought the Post-Punk Chronicles and DiY series, or the Left of the Dial boxed set Rhino put out, you have a fair amount of these songs. Licensing fees must be getting ridiculous as this is the third appearance of ""Tell Me When It's Over"" by the Dream Syndicate on a Rhino release, and others fare similarly bad in terms of repeat appearances. Too much British stuff here falls into the canon of college rock.I really wanted to like this, and if you haven't been a big fan of this genre and the genres it sprang out of, you might find this boxed set useful, but I am, and I don't as I already have a lot of it and most of what I'm lacking, I don't want.Signed,epsteinsmutha"
3,"Byou-The Hot New Dance Workout-""Right""",I purchased this item for my eleven year old daughter and she really likes it except the moves on the DVD are much faster and harder than either of us expected. It is a good DVD but I wish they would have taken the steps slower.
1,TOO FAST,The video as far as what it is for was great. The only problem was it went in fast speed. My granddaughter is 11 yrs old and took dance lessons for 2 yrs. She loves to dance and also needs this for weight loss.This video is not very well set up. It gives you the step by step for each dance/workout but it is very very fast.You would have to wait the 1st part for 5 mins. a day each day to just get the 1st steps down and continue. It would take forever to ever learn the steps at this speed. In future they need to slow it down. I don't recommend this for adults or dance pros.
5,THIS LOOKS REALLY FUN,i dont have this game yet but it looks really fun you can leran really fun dance moves and work out or watever but the only put down i thik is that once you learn all the dance moves there arnt any more thers only 3 that might get borin after a while. but hey i dont haveit so im just gonna say it looks fun so im goin to go buy it sine i senn the commercial.IF ANYBODY THAT HAS IT PLAZ WRITE A ACCURATE REVIEW
1,Dance moves are way too fast for kids under 10,"I've never felt inclined to write a review before. My daughter saw the ad for this on TV and HAD to have this DVD. After reading all of the reviews that accurately stated that the steps were too complicated for an 8 year old, I didn't follow my instincts and I ordered this product. Bad mistake. All I heard tonight was ""it's too hard, it's too hard"". I sincerely doubt she will bother trying it again.She started with the ""one on one"" lessons. At times they zoom in on Ms. Bryan's face, and you totally miss the foot work necessary to execute the dance move.It's a shame because the music is good & the moves aren't trashy - a rare combination in this day and age."
2,Fun to Watch,"Fun to watch but my 9 1/2 yr. old daughter could not follow the moves. Neither could I for that matter. We tried to learn the moves through ""breaking it down"" but there is just not enough repetition. Too complicated."
1,Is this the Cheetah girls tryouts or something?,"First, this is only for people with a serious dance background... there is virtually no instruction. You just watch the girls do the moves a couple of times and then go on building from there. And there is no instruction in how the moves are done either.I also like to watch people dance facing away from me, wathing them from behind (if I am learning full blown choreography). That way I am doing the exact same moves of them... not mirroring them, which is a much harder way to learn.Anyway, if you are a serious dancer, who is up on all the hip-hop moves, this vieo will work for you... otherwise you will end up being totally frustrated. This is not the mother/daughter workout I hoped it would be.Thanks ""Byou"" for taking $10 I will never see again. Not!"
5,Byou is Byou,Im actually 17 and i have this aswome work out dvd it's fun and a great postive work out i dont care how old iam its for all age's besides if your little like say 10 or 9 i dont think it will be best for little girls if your the kind that will not use it i used it tiwce i just do it to have FUN and not give up like sabrina bryan says byou and have fun. DONT GIVE UP
2,too hard for little girls,"My 6 year old daughter saw this advertised on tv and wanted it so badly that she emptied out her piggy bank and bought it for herself.She is SOOO disappointed--the dance instruction is WAY too fast. Even the ""break down the moves"" section is too fast and short. There is not enough instruction or repetition--this video is for those who already know the dances.For anyone with younger kids, Bella Dancerella is MUCH better. My daughter's friend has it and they both enjoy THAT one."
1,Impossible to follow!!,"If you want to learn dance steps as a fun way of exercising -don't buy this DVD!! There is hardly any instruction to speak of. It's more of a performance DVD than a teaching DVD. After 2 minutes of the warm-up I gave up and watched. If you don't have dance training, forget it! If you do have dance training, forget it! Very disappointing."
2,"Nice idea, but....","Way too hard to follow. My 4 year old refuses to bother, and my 9 year old is getting very frustrated. It goes very fast, and there is no step by step instructions. Even *I* tried it, I do aerobics on a regular basis and am familiar with the format, but I couldn't keep up with this video either. I hope that she doesn't give up on it, because it could be really fun. But she's going to have to watch it two hundred times for her to be able to catch on to the steps."
2,too fast,"i bought the video for my niece (age 10) to get some exercise, but she can't stick with it because it is going too fast for her."
1,Don't bother,"I bought this for my daughter thinking she would love to dance along with one of her favorite ""cheetah girls."" After being very excited to try and up on her feet for the first 10 minutes she gave up. This video would be fun if it had more breakdown of the dance moves and was slower paces. Even I after years of dance and cheerleading had difficulty keeping up. Don't bother buying this video if you looking for something your child can actually follow along with."
4,Speedy,"I thought that the viodeio was great. It is a little speedy and I wish saprina added a little longer time to practice each move. What i did and recamend others do is not rush. Go over the first step many time untill you could do it on you own almost. The viodio is fun expecaly once you colpete the entire thing and do the full speed. The shoe savy is dissapionting, I waish she had done somthing else. Also I do not think anone who is begginer or young sould do this."
1,To hard,I bought this for my 13 year old daughter thinking it would be good exercise for her but it is way to hard. Very fast paced and very hard to keep up
4,Very happy,"I really like this dance workout. Sabrina is a great teacher and she goes through each step so you can keep up! I didn't know what to expect, but I'm glad I got it!"
5,great!,my 8 year old absolutely loves it! and she has no prior dance expereince..it is a little difficult in that they move fast but she still keeps trying!
2,Too hard to follow -- even WITH dance training,"I bought this DVD so my daughter and I could dance along together and get some exercise -- however it is far too difficult for a young person to follow, and get this -- even with my many years of dance training, it was too difficult for ME to follow! The moves are NEVER broken down by count, and the instruction is incredibly poor. Virtually every dance class I've ever taken - including Master classes - broke down moves by count, so you can be on time, ""on"" the music. Not so here. It felt muddled and confusing. Additionally, in the ""instruction"" segment, the moves are shown just once, from one angle, so if you aren't already familiar with the move shown, the guidance is inadequate.It gets the two stars only for its appeal to teens & tweens, an underserved group when it comes to mixing exercise and fun. I'd like to see more dance/exercise videos for this age group, but PRODUCED BETTER."
1,Horrible,"Two minutes into the video and my daughter as already given up. The moves are way too fast for anyone, who isn't already a trained dancer, to mimic. There is absolutely no instruction, and like another reviewer said, the dancers face you which is also hard to copy. I feel like it was a waste of money. A dance video marketed for girls shouldn't be so complicated. My daughter has wanted this video for a while and I am sad that she is so disappointed with it."
2,It's cute--but not for a beginning dancer,"I bought this for my niece who is 10 years old. She's so into the whole cheetah girls thing so I mainly bought it for that reason. Overall it is well-put together and very cute choreography. However, they do a *terrible* job breaking down the routine and actually teaching it. My niece was getting really, really frustrated, as they move lighting fast. I would expect with any of these type dvd's you would stop and start the dvd as needed to get the moves. However, I had to stop the dvd player, chunk the routine out myself and teach it to her just to keep her from crying, which is something I think a dvd targeted to kids should do on its own. If you have a dance background and plan to be around to help the kid learn the routine, I would recommend it. Otherwise don't buy it for a kid unless they have a good amount of dance/cheerleading experience."
2,Byou,"My 11 year old daughter found this too hard to keep up with. I think it is best for those with a dance background. The music is good, though."
3,Would be... could be...,"But it isn't. I was looking for a dance workout to do with my children around. They seem to think that getting on the floor to work out means it's time to play!? *smile* So I thought I'd take the dancing route. WEll not with this one! She doesn't take enough time to go through the dance moves before moving on to the next move. I had to stop and do the play slowly so I could try to learn, even that didn't work. It looks like fun though if you are already a dancer!"
2,Dance or exercise? Too fast to learn to slow to burn.,"I don't like to write negative reviews in general so please don't think I'm one of those people who has to find something wrong with everything. That said, I think this video is a great concept but fails in function. In order to be considered an exercise video it keeps moving and adding new steps too quickly to learn them before moving to the next sequence. On the other hand it still tries to ""teach"" the steps so it's too slow (and overwhelming) to keep up any kind of aerobic benefit. If your child isn't talented, experienced and/or willing to rewind the video to death to get it down you may fair better with another video. Read my review for Urban Jam with Laya Barak. She gets it right!"
3,Time Out DC,Great general overview but I have found many a hole in the wall that is really fabulous that was not in this edition of Time Out so perhaps we need a new edition? It is good for when you have absolutely no clue about the DC area though and just need a pointer in the right direction. If you then go exploring its like a treasure hunt with lovely little gems on the way.
4,But where's the rest of season four?,"It's odd that a set like this does not contain the complete series. There are thirteen episodes from season four which have not been released on DVD yet. As far as I can tell, there's nothing new here.Hopefully we won't have to wait much longer for the rest of the series, but the lag between the release of season three volume two and season four volume one was nearly 18 months.I also see that MGM is listed as the producer of this set. Fox released the original movie, the TV series, all the DVD's up to this point. So while this doesn't quite make sense, I'll be happy if it gets the rest of the series released."
5,Fantastic,"I loved the latest edition to Cole collection. Merrick and Alexandra were a perfect match for each other. The chemistry between these two was sizzling. I loved how the family continued the tradition of spending Christmas and New Years Day together after all these years. I have read all 12 of the books, and I look forward to the next book. Keep up the good work Rochelle."
4,At last Hideaway is back,"Renegade was not the best way to end the series so glad its back and with a stronger storyline, glad that the story of Alex and Merrick hinted at in Renegade gets its own title.Hope to read more about the Cole's et al. This title stands alone but its best to read the whole series starting from the beginning in Best kept secret which is really book 11 but sets the scene for the whole series."
3,Poor customer service after the fact,"I would never buy another baby trend product. I have this unit and it was basically impossible to put the handle down on the infant carrier. I called the customer service number and was told that the handle was put on too tightly when the unit was put togther. The only way to get it fixed was to send it back to the company and they would fix it, however, the process would take a minimum of 2 weeks. When I told them that I could not be without a car seat for 2 weeks and asked if they could send me a replacement while mine was being fixed I was told ""no - sorry that's all that we can do for you"". PS - WD 40 fixed the problem. The stroller is sturdy but pulls to one side and takes up alot of room in the SUV."
1,Terrible purchase,Save your money. This stroller is just too damn big to manage. The wheels don't turn well while navigating it either. We spent about $180 on this stroller and only used it a total of 3 times! We bought a little $20 stroller that has worked more wonders than this big piece of junk!
4,Easy carseat and Great stroller,"What I like about the carseat is that to adjust the straps all you have to do is turn a knob. No taking anything apart! I had a premature baby and had to have a carseat that measured just right - with this knob to adjust the straps it is no problem getting her fitted right.We got this system because of the stroller. This is our 3rd child and the strollers we get never hold up at the ballpark. This stroller is not made to manuvear in the mall and stores, no jogging stroller is. I thought it was very easy to put together and it is easy to fold up and put in the car. It is bulky with the wheels.What I don't like about it is that it clicks when I walk. The locks that come down to lock the back wheels hit against the wheels when I walk. That's my only complaint!"
4,The Expedition is like the cadillac of strollers,"Great stroller and car seat. Stroller is easy to fold and unfold. Works great on grass and dirt roads, where I live. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I wish the front tire had the option of moving/swiveling or locking instead of just not moving/swiveling at all, but it turns pretty easily and even my husband loves driving it."
4,comfy but bulky,"This is a great stroller IF you have room in your vehicle for it. Otherwise you end up having to take off the rear wheels just to get it in. Once you get the hang of opening and closing it, this stroller is a breeze to use.The only downside is the bulk. Not a good stroller for travel that involves public transit of any sort. I'd have given it five stars but it took a bit to get the hang of getting it open and closed quickly."
4,"Great quality, exept for a watermark...","This collection contains all of Chaplin's shorts, only it's missing five Essanays, and The Pilgrim. If you'd like to see Charlie's early work, this is a must-have. You won't find much better picture quality anywhere else. There's only one problem that I can identify, there is a watermark playing through all of the shorts. For those who are unaware of what a watermark is, it's like a telivison station logo. Most of the time, you can hardly see it, but when the screen is dark, it's quite visible. I wouldn't mind the watermark if they only had spelled his name right. It reads ""THE CHARLIE CHAPLEN COLLECTION"". . . aside from this flaw, great set. And, even if I knew about the watermark, I'd purchase this anyway with no hesitation."
2,"Fascinating content, but Kindle can't handle Unicode.","The content of this book is wonderful, providing a thorough discussion of vulgarity in ancient Greece. Also has an excellent discussion of why exactly we use profanity. However, being a book on ancient Greek language necessitates having contents that are in ancient Greek. The kindle has considerable difficulty handling this. Highlights don't work right, words are broken in half by random spaces. The price is much too high for a such poor quality transcription."
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED - WRONG HEADING ON THIS,"This is NOT HP Premium Plus High Gloss Photo Paper. Instead the package says it is HP Advanced Photo Paper. Instead of being 80 lb, it is 66 lb. I have both and it is not the same quality. The printed part number on the package is Q7852A and someone stuck a label over the product code and stuck another label on to SAY it is HP Q6568A Premium Plus. Not nice."
5,A must read for all women!,"There is no book written better than this one to teach women how they are seen by men and how they should be seen, and why!"
1,Dressing with Dumbness,"Colleen Hammond's book, dressing with Dignity, is the most poorly written book of it's kind I have seen. It destroys the entire purpose of old-fashioned dressing and Catholic way of life with slang words I will not repeat. It copies most of the exact same words of the superior book, ""Immodesty, Satan's Virtue"" by Rita Davidson (available at http://www.lffa-ollmpc.com ). Mrs. Davidson's book is much more informative, with sewing tips as well for making modest dresses. You can also buy modest dress paterns at the excellent above site. Hammond's book is trash which, if I were a mean old colledge professor, I would force my students to read for punishment."
4,"Hard to accept at first, but worth it","This book is written beautifully and is so easy to understand and relate to. If you don't know already, the pope's rule or reccomendation for modesty is shirts with 3/4 sleeves to cover elbows, no more low cut than 2 fingers width, and skirts that go past the knees. This is pretty difficult to comprehend at first because it seems so strict, but she supports these reasons so well. She gives a checklist on how to know if what you own is modest, which i liked also. This book is very much worth it."
3,this is lovecraft,this is a good portrait of lovecraft by someone who knew him personally however i must stress the letters are edited so that was a disapointment
2,Could've Been Better,"I like Kristy McNichol's acting, but this movie was boring. There just isn't enough depth to any given character or scene for the viewer to connect with the movie in any way.The dance scene where Kristy and Patrick Cassidy dance is suppose to ""symbolize"" the main character loosening up. Instead, it's just goofy dancing to bad music, even for 1984 standards.I think the actors did their best with the material they were given. Sorry Kristy, it just wasn't enough."
1,"Wow, can you say CONTRIVED?","I can usually go for a romantic, feel-good movie but this movie was ridiculously contrived in the ""love"" department. This character had every man she ran into (and even her message takers) falling for her without any real motivation. In the real world, men don't fall at your feet or as this movie seemed to portray -- THROW themselves at your feet! I can believe that two men might fall for this character in the same timeframe but this bordered on ridiculous. And when she finally does get laid -- she says, ""That was much better than fondue."" OMG -- pretty lame.And the soundtrack -- monotonous. Same musical phrasing played again and again. Uh, two ABBA songs at the dance party does not a soundtrack make! As for the person who recommended this as a rental for a date -- I have to disagree! Try SERENDIPITY if you want a fun romantic film for date night."
5,Classic Romance,Came within a couple weeks. This was a classic...loved the movie. Nothing like a good ending. Would recommend to anyone who loves a loves a fun movie and good happy ending.
4,I enjoyed this movie,"I have seen this movie more than once. Besides Kristy McNichol, there are many other great actors in it, such as Robert Carradine. I also really like the soundtrack (ABBA!) There are many cute moments in the movie, such as the dance scene and her ""wonderful way of speaking french."" It is a good movie to see on a lazy afternoon."
3,Kind of nice,"It's fairly large, and the black and white part in the middle is really strange to me...not sure why it's there. Nevertheless, this is a nice nightlight. I have several other lights made from shells, so this fits in well with that theme."
5,LIGHT,"It is soothing and makes me feel like I'm at the beach all year. It was very carefully packed, promptly shipped and well constructed. Thank you so much."
3,A Solid Effort!,"Paul Postma explains marketing strategies based on new technology. His strongest material emphasizes using information age technology to learn about consumers' behavior. New technologies, he explains, must be adapted to actual human behavior, because technology has changed quickly, but the human mind has not. Postma cites successful applications of these techniques, mostly from the Netherlands. A few concerns about the book: There are many good insights, but they sometimes get lost in the academic writing and extraneous detail. The basic marketing discussion is very basic. And, rapid change has already slightly dated some material though the book is only two years old. We [...] recommend this book to marketing managers and company owners who use the newest technology, and to academics teaching college classes on marketing methods."
2,Disappointed no new revelations on how to market given.,"This book may be more suited to someone that never has been in business before or someone who lives in a third world economy. No insights on how to market in this new digital age with all the various types of marketing media.Its too bad with all of the author's background he did not give us one example of how any corporate business is using each ""marketing media"" and with what results. While his remarks on how our brain works were interesting, it didn't reveal any startling revelations. This book only speculates that something never changes. The coverage of this topic was more suited to a lunch hour discussion than a whole book. Unleasing the Killer App,by Larry Downes, while not focusing on marketing, at least made us aware of the importance of the customer in marketing, with more compelling insight."
1,"Choppy read with little insight, a poor investment of time.","""The New Marketing Era: Marketing to the Imagination in a Technology-Driven World"" was a very difficult read and didn't come close to meeting my expectations. Rarely do I come away from a book feeling that I have gleaned very little - yet I found this text far from profound and even more distant from enlightening. This would possibly be satisfactory if I were seasoned or an expert in the profession of marketing; but I am new to the ""game.""The first four of the five chapters simply didn't flow. It is almost as if the author had started four separate books and decided he could combine his works and call it one. How else could the lack of continuity between the chapters be explained? Maybe the essence of the book was lost in the translation? Wish I could be more complementary. Postma undoubtedly is knowledgeable in numerous disciplines - he just failed to come across as an authority."
5,Best pork rinds I've found,"Anyone on Atkins diet knows that pork rinds can provide a much-needed crunchy snack. The ones I find at Kroger's usually have some hard, tooth-cracking pieces in every bag. I haven't found any of them in these bags. I first tried the case of variety flavors and definitely prefer these Hot Barbecue ones."
4,Strong but good,"This was a very strong scented balm, but it worked well. I used it at night because it smells so strong I didn't want everyone around me during the day to smell it too."
5,MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!,"HEY, Robert, where are you????? More Books!! More Books!! I have searched high and low for more Robert Holdstock books. Specifically The Fetch and The Bone Forest. This is one of my most favorite authors. I don't just read his books, I happily devour them! (Multiple times). I really enjoyed everything I have read, I just need MORE!"
2,cheap at half the price,"Starts out good but loses it half way through. Becomes pretentious, rambling, overreaching. The second half was very hard to finish. Too much explanation and citing of Jungian whatsit. All the action becomes just so much silly shifting and shaping and changing, and it collapses under its own weight. Stick with Mythago Wood, don't bother with this."
2,No conclusion and a lot of confusion,"I've just finished the italian translation of this book, that I bought just hoping it would have explained something of the mysteries left by the previous ones. But I have found no explanation of what happened before, no complete end for the present plot. It stops and you don't know if somebody is dead or alive, nor if the heroes will escape the forest. Moreover, a lot of speculative theories borrowed from the worst Jung and the worst smoky psychology and anthropology. It is confuse, foggy, ununderstandable and I really can't understand why somebody can like it. Even though some good ideas are spread here and there (the myths of Jack, Jason and Sarin are the best part), they are like flashes in a dark night: soon lost without trace."
3,Strange Yet Good,"I don't normally read this type of material, but I found this book quite interesting. It begins well, but begins to drown towards the end."
4,Book # 3 of Mythagos is better than # 2!,"The Hollowing was a much faster paced book than it's predecessor, Lavondyss. Where Lavondyss stagnated after a little over half way thru, The Hollowing kept going onwards.A father's search for his lost son in the woods of mythago is a tour-de-force read. From primal man to Jason and the argonauts - how could you go wrong here?If you want a different sort of read than your average fantasy fare - look no further!Characters grow and adventure bounds in this intensely harrowing adventure the likes of which I'll continue to discover. From dream-like sequences to horror-filled creatures - this was a thrill ride read.Now, which book is number 4??"
4,the hollowing,"I found this book to be incredibly interesting and in some ways insightful. Holdstock has a wonderful imagination and talent for combining what is very close to if not an original myth to the subconscious perspective of his characters. I learned from his mythagos, and his view of the human mind or being. I met soldiers from ancient Rome, the Argonauts and legends I never even knew existed. Even though I was somewhat disappointed with his ending, it left me thinking about the determination of his characters, his wonderful mythagos, and imagination itself."
4,Another pearl from Robert Holdstock...,"...well it truely is, I can't really see it in a bigger picture since I have not read all his books that takes place in Ryhope Wood, also known as Mythago Wood, but it takes place in the years after 'Gate of Ivory'...I really enjoy all the strange things that appears in this book and I haven't been able to find it anywhere else, by any tother writers, which isn't so bad, since it makes Robert Holdstock to stand out in the mass.Enjoy it!!!!"
4,"Actually OK, but could be stronger.","I think the story is interesting, for this is both a murder and history book. Comstock and company murder the ship's captain and management. Then the murderers murder one another. Then the natives murder the murderer, plus most of the innocent crew. It also shows the history of the whale oil trade and the business of the Nantucket whalers. For those reasons, it is a good yarn, but I agree with one of the previous reviewers that the author threw in other material.I thought this a good and interesting read. Toward the end of the book, the author throws in the stories of the Comstock's innocent brother, and those that recovered the two ship-wrecked crewmen.A good read."
3,Not what I expected,"I bought this book on the reduced rack at Barnes and Noble. I like to read about history and sailing so I thought for $4.99 why not. I would say that it is not the best book you could read and would recommend looking for something different. Try ""Ship of Gold"""
4,Swiftly Flowing Narrative Equals a Good Summer Read,"Thomas Farel Heffernan has all the elements of a swift and exciting summer read in Mutiny on the Globe (The Fatal Voyage of Samuel Comstock). The author pares the story down to its essentials, the bloody mutiny and its aftermath. Some historical context is lost in the rush (for that readers should consult the excellent In the Heart of the Sea by Nathaniel Philbrick, a wonderfully detailed book covering the same historical period). What may be lacking in context is replaced by breathtaking, and often bloody, action. This is the perfect summery beach history book that provides thrills without sacrificing intelligence."
4,Horror On The High Sea,"I read this book while sitting on a beach on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. As I gazed at the ocean in the direction of Nantucket, the bloody horror of this mutiny sent chills up my spin. Mutiny On The Globe is not for the weak at heart. It's a graphic and telling story of life, death and survival. Heffernan brings this horrifying story to you full force. The Fatal Journey Of Samuel Comstock is for most New Englanders interested in our old whaling history and tales of the high seas. Fine Job Heffernan!"
1,Poor Quality product,"When i first saw this t-shirt i thought it was perfect for a gift, but when i receive it i realized that it looks really cheap compared to other options in this price range. i would not pay US$5.00 for this product if i would see it in a store.Definitely i would not buy this item again."
4,Cool.,"Well, that was weird, but still fun to look at. The graphics are awesome! Tons of pictures, its like a whole museum! I didn't get some of the pictures, but thats what art is about, right?"
4,I liked how it was like a battle of self vs. evil.,"I liked the climax. It was slightly different from the usual three little pig story you always read. My 10th grade English class had to do areport on their favorite children's book, and my book was the only one that used a lot of foeshadowing. An example is when the mother pig boils a big pot of water, it eludes to the wolf's defeat. To make a long story short, I loved it."
5,Easy to follow - practical.,"I have no interest in learning a martial art and wanted some easily learned steps to apply, should I get caught up in street crime (I am going to a country, for work, where street crime is high).I knew a few of the tactics listed in the book (go for the eyes, groin, larynx or carotid artery / jugular). These were taught to me by an OTC instructor in college. This book is practical advice that can be learnt fairly quickly. The chapter on the winning mind is great.The book is easy to follow, has enough illustrations, and gave me just what I wanted. Great book."
4,"review of ""dirty dozen"" self defense","I would say the book is helpfull on the getting back to basics of self-defense.It does not contain rocket science, but is very realistic,in My opinion.It is basically a ""hit-hard"" and get away type of system,it is not about the sparring type of ""martial arts"".I think even the experianced fighter will find something helpfull in this book."
3,"Save your money,","Just use common sense as long as you aren't a plain fool. Has a lot of thought provoking articles though so, if your like me and sense isn't all that common this is a great book for you, to have."
2,Not that great,"The techniques presented in this book are simple, easy to learn, and would seem to be very effective. However, the actual techniques take only a few pages to explain and it seems as if the rest of the book is just filler to justify the price of the book. This book would be worth borrowing from the library, but not worth purchasing. Most of the techniques simply rely on grabbing the opponent's hair and striking vital areas such as the throat, side of the neck, eyes, or temple."
4,A decent robotic song.,"The song gets 3 stars, and for adding Punk from the live at Spundae mix (the best track on that CD), it gets another. It's a pretty decent techno robotic vocal song. Not that big a fan of robo-vocals, but this one plays out fine. One note to the other reviewer, the vocals are ""let's ROCK, I wanna Rock your body Rock""... and no, it is not the f-word as much as you'd like it to be."
4,A Must For Teethers!,This is my 6 month old daughter's favorite teether! It is the easiest teether that she has for her to hold onto.
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PLAYER,"After less than 18 months of ownership, my player, which I had treated with exceptional care, began putting large, arc-shaped cuts into random discs. I gave the player the benefit of the doubt at first, but after 4 discs were scratched in the same manner, in different slots, I knew this player was the problem. Then, to add insult to injury, the player stopped reading discs entirely just this week. I now have a huge, worthless player that I spent $600.00 on just last year. I wish I could say this was the first problem I've had with a sony product. From this moment on, I will never buy any sony electronic equipment."
1,This is so ridiculous,I'd really like to buy this season but I'm not paying that for such a short clip. I actually think ATHF is only 11 min. Amazon should bundle shorter episodes when selling them.
3,Weather-tech is better,"I exchanged this through Amazon for the Weather-tech version and now I am more satisfied. The husky liner never laid flat and was made from a cheaper, more plastic material."
3,Lots of information,"Sufi Martyrs of Love by Carl Ernst and Bruce Lawrence is a travel through the history and practices of the Chishti order of Sufism from its beginnings to the present. The book did a good job explaining how Sufis of the Chishti order have reconciled being Muslim and a Sufi. The book also discussed how many Muslims particularly Whahbbis do not see Sufism as part of Islam. The book touched upon many interesting concepts such as these and it was obviously well researched. However, if you are looking for a basic introduction into Sufisim this is not it. It was a very slow read and at times very dry. There were many times when I found myself skipping entire paragraphs that seemed to just be filled with the names of Sufi masters. There were far too many names to keep track of and their significance within Chishti order. If you have a good foundation of knowledge of Sufism and want to learn about the Chishti order then this is the book for you. If not, then try your luck elsewhere."
2,"Low resolution, low video quality, nice customer service","One thing that has has not been included in any technical description of this frame grabber is that, it supports a maximum resolution of 320x240 for video. I was not satisfied with the overall video quality either. However, I felt inclined to give a star for their good customer service and fast response time to my e-mails."
2,woodywalt,Order took two weeks (14 business days exactly) to receive and arrived damaged. Now I need to return the damaged book that arrived after I needed to give it as a gift and wait for a credit. Never heard back from vendor if they were going to try to find a replacement. Less than thrilled with this vendor / shopping experience.
4,They really work,"My son is four and in Pre-K 4. His teacher told me he was falling behind because he couldn't recognize the numbers. Well, I started searching around for learning tools for counting and I found this set of tapes. I got them and started playing them for my son and they are really catchy tunes. He has improved 100%."
4,Great fun,"My daughter wanted the ""complete"" set of Barbie and her family...we've got Skipper, Kelly, Ken, Barbie (of course) and now Stacie. She was SO excited to receive it AND this Stacie particular Stacie is a gymnast (as is my daughter) so Stacie is now a favorite."
5,Great scoop!,"I am very pleased with this purchase. The scoop feels like a good quality item, even though the packaging makes it look pretty cheap. It does scoop a smaller ball, perfect size for a regular cake cup but if you want big scoops to fill waffle cones or such, you better look for another scoop. From what I understand there is something contained inside the handle which keeps the scoop from frosting up, making it difficult to get your scoop off of it. Whatever it is, it must work because I haven't had any ice cream balls stuck to it yet. I just rinse it with warm water after each use and wipe it dry."
1,Mainly fluff here,"I was very disappointed in this book, as there really isn't much detail. The entire book basically walks you through installing MPS and ICA Clients WITH THE DEFAULT SETTINGS!!! In short, it is mainly just screenshot after screenshot of default settings and ""Click Next to Continue"".Even the chapter on ""Configuring Policies"" is mainly just screenshots with some text below each one repeating what is displayed in the screen capture.Definitely not worth the price; spend your money elsewhere.Also, one of the 5 star reviews is by ONE OF THE AUTHORS (and I would bet that the other is a friend of one of the authors) therefore that is the reason the the number of stars is as high as it is."
2,Lots of fluff,"This was not what I expected. So far I have read 400 pages and have not gained very much. There is a lot of procedures on how to install each component. Do we really need screen shots of every license agreement? Lots of filler here... If you're looking for something with technical detail, then look for a different book. Was not worth the money."
5,A must-have for any teen!,"This book is an awesome must-have for any teenager! The story, as well as being touching, has a funny side to it. It deals with the problems most teenagers or young adults have with their parents. The names of the chapters are cool as well. Rosie Rushton's books are wonderful and amazing!"
3,Over-rated aural pleasure,"I heard this CD at a resturaunt in Marrakesh this summer and I fell in love with the music. Unfortunately, when I bought the album I was disappointed, somehow it did not sound the same. For those of you expecting to hear New Age/ Middle Eastern melodies (like me), it does not come close. Actuallly, it is more appropriately classified as New Age- Indian groves. Nonetheless, the CD 1 is quite good. The instrumental rhythms and melodies are very pleasant. There is a nice blend of synthesizer and African-Asian instruments (tabla, oude etc..). The CD2 is predominately electronic and has a techno-electronica flair (not very ethnic). There is a stark difference between the two."
2,Pompous cheese,"I've heard a lot about Claude Challe, and being a fan of downtempo music, I forked out the extortionate price for Nirvana Lounge. I was expecting to be taken to new heights of musical ecstacy- but what a disappointment. Two CDs of dated and frankly cheesy music. Cheesy beats, cheesy vocals and cheesy instrumentation. Cheese can be a good thing, but not when it takes itself so seriously. I have a feeling that this may appeal to US listeners, but I would not recommend it for UK consumption. Check out some of the Hed Kandi comps or albums by Lemon Jelly or Kid Loco instead."
1,GHASTLY & APPALLING,"This atrocious cd is a grave disservice to the Beatles. The reggae arrangements of the songs is harsh and horrendous. The songs deviate from the Beatle ""norm"" or standard as to be appalling. There is no pleasure to be derived from this ghastly collection. The creators of this dreadful collection should be brought up on charges of song slaughter and cruelty to classics.If you get this CD as a gift, use it as a coaster. It would also make a good miniature frisbee. That is the best purpose this wretched collection has. Skip this one and treat your ears to something good like the REAL Beatles!"
5,Sandra Rocks,I caught her show in San Fransisco and when the Cd came out I was the first to get it. She will leave you rolling in the isle and lasughing until you cry!!
2,Disappointment,"A friend recommended I try this author as I am a great fan of Donna Leon and her Italian mysteries, This was unfortunate as I found this Inspector Montalbano Mystery poorly written, shallow of plot and generally a very second-rate book."
2,Cheap Knock-Off (Select Series Compac Facial Scrub),"I, too, have used Buff Puffs AND several generic brands and this generic brand lasts a very, very short time. I've used it now maybe four times and it has already lost all its firmness and a lot of its exfoliating quality. It maybe half the price of a Buff Puff, but it lasts 1/10 of the time. If you want a decent knock-off that lasts, both the Walgreen's and Long's (now CVS in my area) brands (Regular) are very decent and comparable to Buff Puff (Regular)."
3,facial scrub pad,I was a bit disappointed with this pad. I found it to be rather abrasive. It probably would be good for skin that is not too sensitive.
4,Good supplemental text on local government and zoning,"This makes a great required second book in a local government/administration course. As a matter of fact, it should be required reading for city councilmen all over America.Fischel does a good job of proving the ""people vote with their feet"" hypothesis, but more importantly, he ties property values to virtually every local government action (and inaction). Virtually everything that city government does is capitalized into property values -- sometimes with negative effects and sometimes with positive effects. Americans are extremely mobile, moving every 4 years, so we really do vote with our feet to a greater extent than most city governments care to accept."
5,SO CUTE!!!,Such a cute book...It has great pictures of cats...any cat lover will enjoy this book..being an animal lover myself (cats are my favorite) this book was purrrfect for me...
5,Hans Silvester's Cats in Love,"Hans Silvester has a phenomenal ability to capture cats in their natural environment on film. He obviously has a great understanding of and empathy with these cats. This particular book candidly illustrates cats and their complex relationships with one another. If you love cats, you will love Cats in Love!"
3,Lovers of Pictures of Cats -Rejoice!,"If you love pictures of cats, you will love this book. Many of the same cats appear again and again, mostly roaming free at some sea side location. If you only like the occasional picture of cats-beware! You will hate this book!"
1,More ideology than history,"The author makes use of ideologically motivated platitudes throughout the book, such as ""it was never the destruction of Nazi Germany per se that was the American war aim; it was the prevention of any one power from dominating Europe and limiting American access to it."" (p. 37) The thousands of Americans who gave their lives in WWII would probably beg to differ. A bunch of neo-Marxist Wallersteinian mumbo-jumbo. Its a shame so many impressionable minds are forced by their professors to read this junk."
2,Inaccurate - resolution of 4 lbs!!!,"What a great scale, I thought, until after a few days I noticed that my weight was either 150.4lbs or 153.6lbs. Please, give me something in between! But no, alas, it can't. I even tried carrying small weights onto the scale with me to, but no joy. Avoid like the plague, especially if you're into weight management."
1,don't buy this,"The body fat reporting never worked right.On the weight measurement, you can get on & off the scale and get readings that vary by 2 pounds. Also, over the past month, the scale reported I was gradually losing 10 pounds. Great! I decided to confirm this on my old analog scale & found that I had instead GAINED 10 pounds. I changed the battery, but still the same result, off by 20 pounds. Avoid this product."
2,Excited with My Christmas Gift,"At Christmas 2003 I was very excited with the $50 scale my family purchased for me. It worked as advertised for about six months. Then it displayed the ERR message more and more. We replaced the battery. Then it would not permit any function buttons to perform. We just sighed and used my expensive gift as any $7 bathroom scale. When it went completely blank this week, battery of no use, I hopped on the internet to see what anyone else's experience is. To be fair, I will contact the manufacturer and see if they can make it right. I hope they can. If not, I will see what the Weight Watchers scales is like. Sigh ..."
1,It really doesn't work,"After reading several comments I tried to proof my scale is working properly. However, like someone else wrote the scale is not consistant. I weight myself several times and noticed very considerable diferrences in readings. Like some one else I even tried placing an additional amount of weight in my hands. The scale gave me several readings for the same amount of weight. Now! A digital scale is supposed to be percise..."
2,Scale is okay. B.F. analyzer doesn't work. Plus the NOISE,"It works great as a scale. Comparing what it reads to friends' scales is accurate. However, the body fat analyzer is crazy. Giving extremely different measurements within a 10 minute period. Plus it is so LOUD. Is next to impossible not to wake someone up when I weigh myself in the morning. As a scale it works, but for less money I could easily have a regular scale to tell me the same information."
1,Deceptive warranty,Warranty:Original purchase receipt + original packaging (I have not seen this packaging requirement in extended warranty - who keeps original packaging for life ??Deceptive practice.
3,It was made in China,"It was made in China, so it probably is only accurate up to about 150 pounds or so.They probably didn't have you 300 pound American fatties in mind when they built it."
3,Okay for weight,"I bought this scale in August because I am more concerned for my body fat percent since I am trying to get lean. I do know that some scales arent always accurate so I figured maybe it was a little high at 33%. One late night after 8 hours of work with no AC in 100 degree weather I came home weighed myself and it had gone from 33% in the morning to 26% at night. Then in November it went up to 38 and even once up to 48% and I know that's not true. In one of my classes we got the chance to see our body fat with a caliper and a hand held body fat checker. I had weighed myself with the scale at home after not eating for 12 hours and no drinking, it said 38%. I checked it with the hand held and it said 25% and that I have 36 pounds of fat. So I am disappointed with this scale because I bought it for this reason. The pounds are right but not the body fat, at least for the one that I bought, and apparently from another review I read."
1,Junk,Nothing but problems with unit since I received it. Either it did not work when I went to use it or it had lost its memory and had to be recalibrated all over again. Never had the same weight reading twice! The only reason I rated it with 1 star is because it would not let me enter anything less!
1,Shuts Off Instead of Computing BF%,"After several tries, I have yet to get this thing to show me my BF%. I have gotten it to show me weight -- although not on every try. In most cases, when I step on the scale it turns itself off and will not come back on unless I unplug/replug the 9V battery. This happened in appx 3 out of 8 tries with just the weight mechanism (no personal data stored), and each of about 4 tries after programming it with personal data. Seems like bad software to me. Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but I'm not sure what else to try...guess I'll return this useless thing and look again at the Tanita models."
1,Look elsewhere,"This is an inexpensive scale for measuring weight and body fat. The only problem is it doesn't do either one too well. The weight measurement gives a different answer every time you step on it, even if you weighed yourself just a minute before.I was never able to get the scale to measure my fat percentage or give me any other reading besides an error. Maybe my skin's too thick, or maybe the electrical charge it tries to send through your body is too weak.It's also inconvenient to use. To get your weight, all you have to do is step on it. To get the weight and fat reading, you have to hit the power button multiple times to cycle through all the settings, then step on the scale within 5-10 seconds to avoid it turning back off."
1,Look elsewhere,My scale stopped all but the weighing functions after 4 months.Target had them on clearance and I had no receipt any longer and they only gave me $9.99 credit:(
5,Perhaps the most influential book of my entire life!,"I feel obliged to acknowledge my gratitude to Ben Bova for this book. My parents were strict Southern Baptists, and my father a minister, and yet they bought me this book before I could read. This book first exposed me to evolution (though it was many years later before I accepted it!) and saved me from the nonsense of believing that dinosaurs and humans could co-exist.A writer never knows where the seed he sows will fall. Thank you, Mr. Bova, from that young boy who was exposed to a whole different mode of thought by this book."
4,"An enjoyable read, if a little predictable","Interesting concept and well laid-out story, I enjoyed reading about Yelena's adventures, although some parts were easy to predict.I'm very interested to see how the story continues in the next book.Note: I also posted this review on Goodreads."
5,Enthralling!,"Wonderful book, I could hardly stand to put it down and barely slept, but it was worth it! Can't wait to dive into the next one!!"
5,"Loved this book, one star reviews make me wonder about the people...","..who bought it.What were they expecting?This book was great, original, kept me reading.Someone mentioned this was more ""Romance than fantasy"". Yes, that's why it was the in the Romance/Fantasy section of my Borders. Yes, Luna is part of Harlequin.. I figured that out really fast as well just by keeping my eyes open."
1,Need serious editing!!,I picked up this book because it came highly recommended however I was pretty disappointed. There are continual awkward phrases and plot holes that could have been easily fixed with a good edit! I don't usually write reviews and I am often oblivious to prose that others might find objectionable but I just had to comment on this particular book because the issues were so glaringly apparent even to me! I found it almost unreadable. The story has potential but the whole book feels unfinished.
4,Great fast read.,"I just finished this book & found I couldn't put it down. A friend gave me a copy a couple of days ago and I was riveted. There were some fairly transparent moments, but overall well crafted. I was a little frustrated by the glossing over of the Yelena's past, but perhaps that is another book. The author begins to explainn, then fails to follow through. Overall a fantastic fast read that will keep you entertained for a while and appeal to your inner romantic."
2,Mediocre,"I don't understand how so many people can give this book a 4 and a 5. I was really excited to read it, but when I did I was so dissapointed. The plot was simple, the characters simple, the setting was simple.I mean get this, The only picture I have of Yelena's world is a castle, a couple of roads leading from the castle, a forest. I picture...I can't even rememer the country name, but all I can picture is a bunch of square Sectors divided up. EVERYTHING IS SO GENERIC. Besides the lack of world building, there is really not even a substantial plot to carry the book. The start was promising, but the book did not deliver.I don't think I'd read anymore of this series."
5,Wonderful!,"I will be the first to admit that I stayed up until one in the morning reading this book. I just couldent put it down! There are a few minor flaws (such as one almost complete reversal of a characters personality), but the plot is so good that they are easy to overlook. Yelena is a good example of a strong female character, and most of the other characters are very easy to like. I wouldent really recomend this book to anyone under 13 or so, but to me it was the perfect book for young adults who are tired of juvinile fiction, and for adults who still like a touch of magic."
3,Good with a few faults,"This book has a wonderful plot and is reletively well written. There were a few problems, however.The first is that the characters had a bad tendency of talking as though they were living in a modern age. This broke the feeling of age in the book. (The comparison of a room's smell to ""disinfectant"" didn't help that, either.)Also, the main character, Yelena, is almost a Mary Sue, what with her being intelligent, rather pretty, and magical to boot. (I feel I should note, however, that Yelena is still a fascinating, well-drawn character. She just happens to be borderline perfect.)Some of the characters are flat, especially Valek, and the villains are evil with no redeeming qualities to make them seem human.Besides these complaints, the book was very good. I stayed up late finishing it. (The exciting climax alone is enough for me to urge you to at least get it from the library.)"
4,"Good book, Bad series","This first book is the best of the series. I wish it had been a stand alone book. Unfortunately, there are two other books in the series, and they get progressively worst. I was so disappointed with the final book, I was wishing hadn't even started the series. I would recommend THIS book, but not the others in the series, but it is really hard to start a story and not find out how it ends."
4,Painfully Predictable,"I enjoyed the book largely because the main characters were well constructed. The only poorly thought out character is the Commander. But, the review loses a star because the plot is painfully predictable. Being something of a student of history, I was a little put off by the improbability of society so rigid it would put Hitler's Germany to shame let alone it's economics but I believe that's within the realm of a reader's responsibility of suspense of reality."
5,Amazing First Novel,I cannot tell you how much I loved this book! It was one of the best novels I have read recently. The character development was amazing and the story was fun and believable. 5 stars all the way.
3,going for a ride?,"I bought this as a ""Tweener"" while my wife finished the book i wanted to read next. 3 books later I had read the whole trilogy non-stop. But that does not make it a great book or series. The entire series is wall to wall action and Poison Study, the first in the series introduces us to the heroine. She has about every form of good and bad fortune that can be crammed into a shortish novel. Despite the over the top strains on our willingness to believe, she is an engaging girl and the whole story is fun. So if you are traveling and want some non-stop action, this will do just fine."
4,Pleasantly Surprised.,I thought this book was going to be a bit boring being about a food taster because what could possibly be interesting about a food taster?...It wasn't boring at all. I enjoyed every minute of the book and can't even remember any areas in which the story became dull. I was pleasantly surprised and purchased the next book in the series immediately.
5,One of the top YA I've ever read,"Yelena accepts her fate and feels no remorse for the crime she has committed, even after being locked away in prison for so long. The story begins with her emerging, expecting death. Instead, she is offered reprieve. But, she must be the food taster to catch deadly poisons and works for Valek. Valek is intelligent and mysterious in the beginning. His character is beautifully written as the story unravels.The story builds and grows, pulling the reader deeply in. An amazing young adult fantasy that is one of the top books I'd recommend. The only downfall is that the reader should stop here and not try to finish the series. Even though this story is amazingly written and easily one of my favorites, the second book falls flat. The writing quality and story falls so completely, it leaves the reader wondering how the same author wrote both works. There is even a third book but I've yet to find the desire to purchase it."
3,"Interesting premise, not very fulfilling","Next in line to be executed for murder, Yelena is instead offered a chance to live - only by accepting the potentially lethal position as official food taster for the Commander of Ixia. Rather than face a more certain death, she opts for the only slightly less dangerous choice and begins her position recognition training under the tutelage of Valek, the Commander's Second. She's a quick study, but it becomes clear early on that someone is trying to get rid of her.Although I enjoyed it, this book didn't quite live up to the potential I thought the premise held. I still intend to read the sequel, though."
4,well done!,"This book was a treat , believable, well developed characters, exciting story and written in a style that makes it a pleasure to read. Magic did play a role in the story, but it was more about the characters and their relationships, which is a nice change from fantasy where magic dominates the story. One minor complaint, I didn't believe that Valek would have accepted the Commander's order to execute Yelena at the end of the story, it really seemed to me that he loved her too much for that. Of course, we never find out what would have happened if the order was actually given to Valek, but it is implied that he would have carried it out. This was just a very minor flaw to me in an otherwise wonderful story. I will definitely be reading the sequel, ""Magic Study""."
4,"Good story, wanted to read the next as soon as I could",I decided to wait to review this until I had finished all three titles in the series.The premise of the story was compelling. Mysterious Valek gives Yelena the choice to die or become a food taster for the General. The subplots were also interesting. I had a sense of the book being more for young adults; the tone of the writing seemed slightly juvenile. But the story was good enough to look forward to the sequel.
5,#1 favorite read,"I've purchased hundreds of ebooks, and this is my favorite book (and series) that I keep coming back to.... It's got action, suspense, and best of all mystery. There are so many yummy twist and turns! The female character is strong, though she's the last person to see it in herself, and you come to love her through her own self discovery. Maria V Snyder is a GREAT writer, you will not be disappointed with any of her books!"
4,Poison Study Review,"I usually don't read novels like Poison Study, but I'm glad I did.Yelena is a likeable and real character and her challenges focus on her skills and intellect rather than some submissive female charms. To that point, at times, the author had Yelena poised weaker than her male counter-part, Valek, which I found disappointing. Valek is created as the infallible, strong ""protect the damsel in distress"" male which romance stories rely on, and the reason I shy away from these stories.Nonetheless, the twists kept me engaged and the subplot of ""Criollo"" had me in stitches. I wonder how many readers realize that Criollo is a type of chocolate bean. Too bad it had evil powers.I wish Poison Study ended here [I hate series]; I think the author could easily write stand alone material that readers like me would seek out. Way to go Maria, I will be looking for more from you and will recommend this book to friends."
3,promising,"I don't understand the 1 and 2 stars -- I really enjoyed this book. For my taste it was a little ""light"" -- characters and situations could have been more developed, and a few plot issues should have been better explained, but as a first book I thought it was very good. I liked Yelena, I thought the plot was well thought out and pretty good, although it slid over precisely what it was that Brazell had been trying to do to Yelena. I liked the fact that the Code of Conduct was not All Good or All Bad -- we didn't have a ""bad country"" and a ""good country"".Am looking forward to the sequel."
4,Solid story and characters with a promising future.,"I have to say I love the world-building that went into this story and all the details about the various poisons that Yelena learns about. That, along with great pacing and characters, grabbed me and I read this book in one sitting.I also fell in love with Valek's character and was pleased when I saw him and Yelena grow closer. The only thing that I found absurd was the setting in which Valek and Yelena decided to confess their feelings for, and sleep with, each other. It amused me, but probably not in the best way."
3,Not My Thing,"This book was a book club selection and not something I would have selected for myself. Since I was able to check a copy out of the library I decided to give it a try. I slogged through the first 30% before finally connecting with the heroine. There were interesting twists and turns in the plot and the suspense builds to an interesting conclusion.Castles, poisons and fighting are not my thing but in the end the book was an enjoyable read."
4,Refreshing fantasy,"Yelena is saved from execution with the choice of becoming a poison taster. A role that takes her from one danger to another as poison is only one of the many ways she might be killed....A refreshing first novel. Many reviewers seem to be female, but as a middle aged male, I confess I enjoyed this a great deal and ploughed through it in one sitting.The author provides an interesting setting - mediaeval but with a semi-benign military dictatorship. Then we have plots, assassination, magic,loyalty thrown into a fast moving and interesting novel. Many interesting characters abound and the plot unfolds out in a way you don't quite expect.As an aside, the UK cover is far more interesting, I would never have picked this up based on the US cover which seems aimed at female readers, this is good fantasy and should appeal to a much wider audience.Very enjoyable indeed."
3,Good First book - like the Kushiel series,"While Yelena is no Phedre, she is intelligent and stubborn. Her flaws are not highlighted, but she is still interesting. The romantic lead is someone I would like to read more about, but poorly fleshed out. I would have preferred if the book were longer - the author has good ideas and her characters intriguing - so much so that more would have been better. As mentioned below, the ending is compelling, and (while a bit pat) still enough to make me anticipate the sequel."
3,"teen girls, female empowerment","the only concern i had was the sex scenes with a 10 yrs or older man who has power over the girl...at first....at least not too graphic, but were they necessary in an uncommitted relationship?"
4,Worth reading,Fun with a good lead charector and interesting supporting charectors. I hope the sequal is as good.This book is worth reading more than once.
3,Has some promise,"The story is not quite what I expected from the title. I was expecting a more elaborate study of poison, but the training to be a food taster lasted only about 1/4 into the book, in the span of a few weeks. There were more focus on her learning other non-poison related things like martial arts and lock picking.I also agree with some of the other reviewers about the lack of world description, good character development."
5,Recommended highly without spoilers,"Best read without even looking at the cover blurbs, this book grabbed me from the first paragraph. The writing flows easily; the characterization is good; the situations are intriguing. The closer I came to the end the more I hoped for a sequel. Fortunately, the sequel is already published. I have recommended this book to both my 18-year-old daughter and my 87-year-old father. Enjoy."
2,"Decent plot line, but . . .","The basic premise is decent, but the characterizations are cliche, the love story is very bad romance novel, the world is undeveloped and unclear, the protagonist wins too easily, and the text is filled with colloquialisms that jar the reader out of the story. *** SPOILERS *** The antagonist is using theobroma to drug the Commander? Has the author been reading a little too much Kage Baker? If the magic is like a blanket surrounding the world then are untrained magicians like CO2 and flouro-carbons waiting to eat up the ozone . . . I mean . . . magic blanket?In all fairness, Ms. Snyder had moments of truly fun writing, especially when Yelena was all by herself and working things out. But Valek, Ari, and Janco were characterizations and not real. And why do the bad guys like Rand always have some physical flaw that tips us off? Sorry, but I can't recommend this book and won't be buying the other two."
4,Danger and adventure,"Yelena is given the opportunity to avoid execution by becoming a food taster for the ruler of Ixia. Although her mind is always half on escape, she finds friendship in her associations with the cook and, oddly enough, Valek, who's the head of security and also Yelena's boss. Tasting food that could be poisoned is dangerous, but so are the intrigues of the palace, and Yelena finds herself caught up in some dangerous adventures.Exciting tale of action and magic for older teens. Some violence and a little language."
2,Same old Luna,"I am disappointed that luna books does not recognize that there are other motivations for fantasy books starring women than sexual assault. Frankly, they present a story that is dark and un-satisfying, though it really did have potential. From my understanding, the Luna imprint was supposedly created to address women's interest in fantasy and romance. At this point, I actually hesitate to buy a Luna book because they have neglected the romance aspect, and honestly, any description of rape makes me very angry. Fantasy is about interest, and impossibility, something that is unreal, but desirable. I can't think of a single thing about this book that is desirable, and it seems a waste..."
2,a little tiresome,"The story wasn't a particularly bad one, but neither was it good. A few plot twists, nothing unexpected. Pretty typical. The characterization wasn't enough to rise above the mediocrity of the plot. Still, I would have given it three stars except for the writing. The author was exceedingly fond of using subject-verb-object (he did this, she said that), with very little variation. After a while it becomes a little monotonous to read.If you're not very picky about what you read, this one isn't bad. Otherwise, I suggest looking elsewhere."
3,A Fun Read,"I really enjoyed this book. An interesting world is created here, but the plot concepts are better than the exectution. Not too many fantasy novels are written in a first-person female perspective. This is not a really heady read; the plot is a little predictable, but I like the story development anyway. I look forward to seeing this author develop her style, as this is a great start. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will certainly read the coming sequel."
2,Great idea - mediocre writing skills,"I got this at the library and was glad it was free. I liked the plot and world the author has created, but her characters and dialogue are somewhat flat. Better execution would have made this a great book. I'll read the sequel - from the library as well."
1,Disappointed,I was interested in the plot until half way through I came across a rather graphic rape scene. I couldn't take it and didn't finish the book.
5,Hard choices make for an exciting read!,"""This book is a fantastic start to an exciting series! I loved the characters and the many plot twists. Also, having extensively studied Soviet Russia, the political and practical aspects of Ixia were fascinating. It struck me as what a young Lenin had hoped for, before things became corrupted. Order, efficiency, everyone with a purpose, not a perfect world, but not necessarily a bad one either. Wonderfully imagined!"""
2,"Great Idea, Weak Writing And Story Development","As Young Adult fictional reading it might pass the test, but I'm afraid the novel ""Poison Study"" lost what little imaginative creativity it had going for it. The story became predictable and the characters came across as cardboard cutouts placed on a medieval stage with contemporary language. The author definitely has some talent for conceiving a story as there were glimmers of hope for a fantastic confrontational ending. Unfortunately, the creativity had run its course early on and the story ended with a harlequin romance whimper.The great thing about books is that one person's Poison can definitely be another's Medicine. Many reviewers seem to have found the antidote. Not I!"
3,let-down,"well-written and riveting from the first sentence. halfway through, the plot unwound and became cliche. too bad."
3,ITS JUST OK,"Not sure where the great reviews come from, it was ok, especially since it was listened to at work otherwise I would have turned it off I think the romance was lacking and the story was not very fun. The writing was not bad in that it flowed just not my kind of story. Maybe the second will be better since I bought it onsale in the set."
5,CHARACTERS WERE RIVETING!!!,"I search and search...read and read, hoping to find an author that can spin a tale worthy of my attention. I have only discovered a handful and I have bought and pre-ordered all of their work. Maria Snyder fell into that category after I read Poison Study. It held me under a spell from the very first page until the last, leaving me with an emptiness at the end because I had finished the masterpiece and I wanted more. I believe that any book can be good with the proper character development and Snyder hit that ball right out of the park!"
3,To much of a title for what's in the book,"One would expect to see how implementing C or C++ robotic applications using real time Linux embedded devices, or inexpensive hardware, would be. Instead, the book guides you on how to build a robot using a PC running Linux (mini-ITX format). All the code is in Java which is not an open source platform, and its downloadable listing takes about half the book. Nothing is covered in depth. More than half of the other book's halve presents information you may already know before purchasing the book, and the rest is easy to get from many robotic sites on the internet.If I could have picked the content before, I wouldn't bought it."
3,Open Robotics...,"Robotics is an area that is still poorly defined, but this book helps to start getting us there.The mechanics are a comparatively easy hack compared to the logic and getting it to be useful.As a project book it is doable and useful, even if not building this exact robot the author does,but it does allow a framework.Since this area doesn't stand still, you can also look at [...] where youmight run into the author of this book too!This is a good TAB style project book. Easy enough to read and written by a builder, not an academic."
5,Excellent,"This book is an essential guide to any one wishing to have a wedding ceremony that is as rich as the Catholic faith itself (also applicable to all faiths). It describes the why's and how's of all components of a beautiful celebration of the sacrament of matrimony and enables a couple to be the fully active, informed, hospitible ministers of the sacrament that the Church calls them to be."
4,Can not feel the effects of the magnets,"I got this to see what extra the magnet would do (nothing) and because it is wider than the other ones I have purchased. THEY DO MAKE YOU SLIMMER. I have to put my belt in another notch now. I think it may be all water weight. They make you sweat a lot, but I love to use them. If you have a long torso this is the one for you. I can feel that my abs have been worked after wearing this all day."
2,Makes you sweat!,I am disappointed in this item. I thought it would make me look slimmer but it doesn't hide my fat rolls. It does however make you sweat like crazy and maybe people can lose the weight that way. When the day is over you can still see my fat ass. Of course that is what I get for leaving the barn door open. He really is a good ass.
3,Larger than I anticipated,"The belt works, though it is much larger than I thought it would be. It almost wraps around me twice. Better suited to men and/or large women."
1,Piece of....,"I was using this slimmer during my gym session, it took two sessions to break it apart, don't waste your money, don't buy this"
1,Sucks,It wasn't the item in the box. The item did not come with magnets. I wouldn't recommend this this to anyone.
2,Neverlast,"I've only used it for a few weeks yet the material started tearing off, I checked it earlier and there is a hole already on the rubber material. This item didn't outlive my older waistband."
4,An Inexpensive Workout Tool,"I purchased this belt not long ago in an attempt to cut away another pound or two while working out. I have used it several times and it looks almost as good as new. It does seem to help lose a pound or two extra of water weight while working out as well as slightly molding the stomach muscles. I've also discovered that the belt seems to help support my back and wear it around all day when I don't have somewhere to go. Overall, the belt seems to do what it's supposed to do."
5,Everlast Slimmer Belt.,"I was quite satisfied with this belt, it is doing everything I expected from it. I was serprised how fast it was delevered to my door."
4,exercise belt with magnets,Belt is made well. Don't know if the magnets do anything but my back seems not to be as sore as it did before the workout. The belt does make you sweat around your waist and the belt is wIder than most belts. I would recommend this product.
4,recommended,"bought this for my husband who is trying to lose weight and he loves it, says it works perfectly ... it's comfortable and not cumbersome."
1,"Didn't you mean ""blue?""",Looks like Hewitt got the color wrong: his prescription is relegating the Repubican Party to the areas of only *part* of the former Confederacy.And even that part is shrinking.
1,How'd that work out for you?,"So, Hewitt, how did those 2006 elections turn out for you? Just a macaque away from controlling the Senate!"
1,Great Book - Did wonders in November 2006...,"Shallow, poorly written and ultimately wrong. Just what we have come to expect from this author..."
2,Good only for the sample problems,"This is not a good book to learn chemical engineering from, nor is it particularly good as a review of engineering for the practicing engineer. If you are planning to take the Professional Engineering examination in chemical engineering and you have good chemical engineering books from your college days, I would encourage you to use the old books to review the fundamentals.Where this book comes in useful is in the many problems it gives at the end of each chapter. I found working these problems to be the best preparation for the exam. If you buy this book, I would suggest you to also buy the solutions manual for the problems. This manual is also available from Amazon."
3,Beauty Marred by Agenda,"Drooker's one conceit here is the beauty of his work. Every page of the book features woodcut scenes with colour for mood, and is accomplished and aesthetically pleasing. Praises can end there, however.Blood Song is supposed to be a wonder to read and behold for the fact that there is not a single word balloon - no dialogue, no narrative. And though Drooker certainly propells his story forward through the pages of silence, one might hope that he could offer better than the overly simple tale of a hapless, honest, and beautiful native girl and the vile, oppressive, and censorious authority figures. Really, if there's one cardinal sin a film or book can commit is that of making me feel as if I've been preached at. Blood Song is a textbook example of this.This is the work of a freshman in college who has just discovered politics - unfortunately for Drooker, college was well over twenty years ago."
1,Disc 5 is BAD,"Disc 5 will not LOAD/PLAY. Long story made short: I'm stuck with it, and only recourse is to deal with the manufacturer, for which I can't find any direct contact info.Enjoy my money Fox DVD"
4,Something's missing,"After 8 years of being together, you miss having Scully and Mulder together on screen in every episode. If you are a true fan, you'll still like season eight and will look forward to nine."
1,great if dvds werent defective,"having bought all the seasons, watching them every so often, i was shocked to learn my season 5 disk one was totally defective, it would just freeze after the fbi warning section. tried to get to different chapters, would just freeze."
5,A great buy if you can get it under 20 bucks,"Season five was when they finally started using good quality film stock and got away from that grainy 80's TV look. The story in the 5th season is really good, starting and ending, of course, on ""draw you back next season"" cliff hangers, but this season the over reaching story and the individual side episodes were exceptionally good.I believe they moved the show to LA during this season and really amped up the look of the show. The picture and sound are great. Great slim case design where the disks don't fall out of the multiple, flip holders."
5,X-Files equals sweet Sci-Fi action!,"Another fantastic season of the best scifi based TV series ever. With great episodes including redux I and II, as well as the critically acclaimed Post-Modern Prometheus and Kill Switch written by William Gibson. One of my favorite seasons."
5,Best Season,"This is the season when I began watching the show, and by far it has been my favorite season. There was always something new going on, with a good balance of comic episodes and serious episodes, and the occasional one that makes absolutely no sense. If you are planning to buy any set of X-Files, this is the one to choose."
5,Great!,This was a birthday gift for my daughter...a huge fan of X-Files. Didn't take her and her fiance long to watch every episode.
2,Don't like Season 5 anymore,"There are some good episodes in X-Files- Season Five, but there is too much unrealistic ideas communicated by Mulder in it. One example is when he says, in ""Bad Blood"", that vampires are very compulsive, counting seeds or nuts they find on the ground. From who's book did Mulder find that out? The viewer is supposed to take everything Mulder says as a given fact throughout the X-Files. WRONG.Many of the episodes in Season 5 are too outlandish for me, too out there. I gave my just-bought copy of SeaSON 5 to my local library."
5,X-Files,I sent this DVD set to my daughter as a gift. She is an X-Files fan and enjoys the show very much.
5,End of Vancouver...,"For the first five seasons of the show, they filmed in Vancouver. After that, they moved to LA. Even through all that, the show remains incredibly well done.In this season, we have a cure for Scully's cancer, we find out what really happened in the Season Four finale episode, and we learn just how deep the conspiracy goes. We also learn more about what happened when Scully was abducted in ""Christmas Carol/Emily,"" and more in ""Patient X/The Red and the Black."" The latter two-parter also expands more into what the aliens are really up to.The season ends with a decent finale, although not as good as last season's. But that's ok, because a month later we got the movie!Great season, great DVD."
3,The Turning Point...,"This is where the series begins a downward trajectory that lasts until the end. Some very good episodes, admittedly, but not as great as the preceding seasons. My recommendations: Pine Bluff Variant, Folie A Deux, Minds' Eye, Travelers (even though it is a riff on sci-fi classic 'The Hidden.""), Bad Blood (One of the best funny episodes of the show.), and Chinga (co-written by Stephen King and DISTURBING AS HELL!) Do yourself a favor and go no further, it's all downhill from here. Goodbye, X-Files, it seems we hardly knew ye..."
3,comment,i have been using it for almost 2-3 weeks. i have not seen any progress yet. i guess you have to use it at least 12 weeks to see to progress so it is early to say anything. i hope it is worth it..
4,Too Early to Tell,Comb is expensive but easy to use with good directions. Shipper was timely. Results will take 4-6 months to see if it actually does the job.
1,Did absolutely nothing for regrowth,"I bought the original HairMax Laser Comb for $650, and stuck with it for twenty five months. Although my hair looked a bit fuller, it did absolutely nothing for regrowth. Since giving up on it, I've read far too many reviews from people with the same experience. I'd advise doing your own Google research. Read the posts from the countless numbers of disappointed users before spending your hard earned money. Nevertheless, HairMax's website shows convincing evidence otherwise. I sure wish I was one of those people. Needless to say, I'm sorry I bought it. Especially at the inflated introductory price."
4,may help to thicken hair and regrow few,"this lasercomb most probably will not regrow much hair, i have used it for about 14 months. i have seen my hair become thicker and looks like they stopped falling, i have even seen some thin hair regrow, after about 6 months very few new thin hair started to thicken and that was it. after 12-14 months people who had not seen me for a year -- said that my hair is thicker. so others also notice these results. if spending 500$ is not much for these kind of use, then this lasercomb may be helpful, it will be more helpful for those who are just starting to loose hair."
2,Product did not work for me,I'm one of those people who bought the hairmax and tried it faithfully for 2 years without any noticeable results or hair growth. The FDA approved the product for safety but clearly any clinical experiments and data need to be repeated independently to validate the manufacturer's claims. I think it's NOT worth the money they're charging.
1,"Waste of time, waste of money","I'll make this short and sweet. My father and I used this comb for several months and it did not do a damn thing. While the mental willing of the hair to get thicker and continue to grow while using this product was fun, it is not effective whatsoever. It's ironic but I also used laser treatments for hair removal and that did not do a damn thing either. Just another way for tons of men to spend their money on hopes and dreams of avoiding the inevitable process of aging."
2,Junk,"Spent $500 on this piece of crap. First comb lasted 6 months then died. Customer service insisted they try sending me a new charging cradle and power cord. That ate up two weeks of lost treatments. They finally had me send the comb back and I got a new one shortly thereafter. Total of about 3 weeks of lost treatment. The second (replacement) comb has now died within a month. Customer service, while polite, seems to now be implying that this is somehow my fault. Here we go again. I have handled this comb VERY carefully and they just keep breaking. Junk."
2,Hair Max is working for me.,"I saw it used on the Rachel Ray Show on her Human Lab segment a couple of years ago, but kept putting it off. Hair Max instructions were easy, and what they said the Hair Max would do it did for me. You use it 3 times a week all over your head. After about 2 weeks my hair was not as flat, had more body. After 3 months my hair is thicker, I can see the little short new hair coming in, can't see my scalp when it is wet now. They said it may take up to 6 months to notice a change. I had used generic Minoxidil for women, it worked for me , but I did not like the feel of it on my hair and it made my hair dull, and it has to be put on 2 times a day.UPDATE 5/2012: I have to say that it seemed to work for the first 7 or 8 months, but my hair started to get thin again. I went back to the minoxidil and in about 3 months my hair started to get thicker. Using the Hair Laser still seems to give my hair more body and using both makes my hair look better."
1,does not work at all,yeah stay away from this i payed $1200 to buy it in 2005 and didn't work at all it may work for some but not in my case so i think stay away and save your moneyGary Buontempo
3,Great concept but here is what I found.,I had purchased one of these devices back in 2006 it is designed on the scientific basis that lasers regrow hair however finding how simple and common the lasers were in these devices I found I could build a more powerful device with about 10 times as many lasers for about 100 dollars. The lasers are 350 Nano meter that just means they are red and they have the power of a laser pointer so you could build this device for about 100 bucks and a trip to radio shack. Do your homework it is easy other than that great product.
4,Let's see what happens,"I just got this thing (professional series) and will be using it in combination with rogaine to see if it helps. I still have a good amount of hair and was previously on propecia but decided to get off the drug. As if 2/23/12 I will track my progress, my temple/crown hairs have been thinning a bit before the propecia (and was mostly restored by it) so I am hoping this thing can at least maintain what I have and perhaps grow some back hairs on the temple.Ill give it 4 stars for now and continue with updates every few months..."
4,"WOW...so far, so good.","After seeing the DATELINE review of hair growth products I decided the HAIRMAX LASERCOMB would be the one for me. I've tried both the other OTC hair growth products (Propecia & Minoxodil) to no avail. If this doesn't work I'll go w/a transplant. But I have to tell you, this product IS working. I've had it about 60 days and used it every other day religiously. I've had many comments about my hair looking fuller. My only concern, and I've seen this on other sites, is headaches the next morning if I do a treatment @ night before bed. I'm still unsure if it's even remotely related, but as I stated, I'm not the only one. However, I plan on just using it in the mornings from now on. So far, so good!"
1,Waisted my money and time,I have waisted my money and time.I had been using this comb for past 2 years....NO USE!!!Now I stopped to use that.I believe all the good reviews are written by the manufacture itself..please don't buy this..don't waist your money and time.
1,Do not get!,for the price don't waste your money. I been using this for a little over a year now and the only thing it has done is make my hair feel better and smoother. Even with that. I did feel it was harmful to me. My head would hurt after using it and the cord broke. I am not sure why this is FDA approved. And the price? What a waste. I spent 490 dollars at the time and I wish I had that money back.
1,not good customer service,"well, what can i say my item came and after the first day it worked one minute then turned off the next , i checked all my electrical sockets and they were fine i had to wait for my return notice and paid to have the item returned which i didnt find fair as it didnt work , its now been a month and i still havent had my money back"
2,Didn't work on me,I bought this the summer of 2007 when i was interning and had spare cash. Figured it'd be worth the investment BEEEEEEEEEEEP. yeah total waste of money. I used it regularly (3 times a week) for over 5 months straight and noticed not even the slightest bit of difference. I continued using it once a week after that but am yet to see any results. I still have it lying somewhere. The only reason i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because it didn't burn my scalp or cause my hair to fall out or smth :)
1,This model NOT FDA APPROVED! Unsafe???,"[...]The HairMax LaserComb Premium and SE models differ from the cleared Hair Max LaserComb in dose rate, method of delivery, and/or treatment parameters. Specifically, the device cleared under [redacted] uses a single light emitting diode and divides its light into nine (9) separate beams to deliver treatment to the patient. The Premium and SE devices use [redacted] and [redacted] light emitting diodes, respectively, which deliver their light energy individually to the patient. These changes could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of these devices and therefore, pursuant to 21, CFR 807.81 (a)(3)(i), new 510(k) submissions are required in order to legally market these devices."
1,No good ... DOA,"While the 1 star may be harsh ... it did arrive DOA. This was a gift for a family member and they said that it would not stay on for more than a few seconds and that it felt/sounded like something was loose on the inside. Item was returned and that process was 4/5 stars due to the ease of working with the seller and the Amazon return process.While I would love to comment on how the product works, I cannot ... hopefully others will have better luck.Of note, this is an older model too, there are newer (cordless) ones by the same manufacturer that are likely (hopefully) better."
2,I have this comb for over a year.,"If you want to buy this comb for regrowth, forget it. It does not regrow any new hair. But it does offer some benefits:1) The hair feel thicker.2) Very few hair shed during regular use. If you stop using it, hair would shed as before.3) The hair feel more manageable.4) Combs like these are used by hair-implant patients for faster recovery.For these simple benefits, the high price of the comb is not worth it."
3,Some scalp problems,"I used the comb regularly for about 3 months and did not see any noticable changes in my hair thickness. Perhaps I needed to use it longer, I don't know.For me, it caused acne breakouts on my scalp which continued to get worse. As a result it sort of hurt when I used the comb. Finally I stopped using it and in about 4-5 days my scalp cleared up completely.In general, I have acne prone skin, but I'd never had scalp problems like that before.Also, for me the comb often gave me a slight headache.Questionable product...."
3,OK for an intro; no practical info,"I didn't really like the book. I've found it to be OK for novices who don't know what enzymes are and what they do. I wanted some practical information for a particular condition but didn't find it here. While I won't say ""Don't read this book"", I wouldn't recommend it to my friends if they wanted some practical information. Glancing over it in a book store is all one would need to grasp most of the information in the book."
4,enlightening but a cookbook like,"As a Licensed Enzyme Therapist from the Loomis Institute of Nutrition I can say that I truly enjoyed this book. It is great to see Lita Lee's clinical approach to writing and how she uses real patient stories to illustrate the importance of Plant Enzymes. However, at times I thought it was a little too much of a cookbook for different disorders and I believe people should be examined by a licensed professional in order to know which enzyme formulas are specific for them. Overall a great read and good for people interested in learning about enzyme nutrition.Dr. Todd Rodman, DC CSCS[...]"
3,Ok but badly printed,I was disappointed with this dictionary. The print quality is very bad and for the price I expected more.
5,Pray,"If you thought you knew how to truly pray you were wrong. This is a step by step way to spend time time with Jesus, God, the Most Holy Spirit, and Our Blessed Mother. This is how you life can be a prayer without words."
2,Send it back,"My wife, for whom I bought this heating pad, and I would have given it a 1, but did not use it long enough to determine if it was really that bad. If you want heat for only as long as you are willing to hold the ""on button"" in the ""on"" position, this may be a decent heating pad. If you have a youngster who will sit around and hold the button in the on position, you may want to give it a try, but only if you want to futz around with returning it eventually."
3,This plot is overdone,"Hollywood makes many movies that copy plots in other movies with small differences. This is a case in point. We have the married couple who are near break up after the death of a child. We have them go to a secluded spot hoping to rekindle their marriage. We have them stumble upon a crime and become involved. We have them misunderstanding what they see. However, there is suspense in the movie. Who are the good guys in the town?"
3,SOGGY BUT SUSPENSEFUL,"WATER'S EDGE is one of those films where you just can't believe how stupid people can be. In this case, it's the hero (well played by Nathan Fillion), who stumbled upon an attempted murder by a local sheriff, who then kills the sheriff, rescues the girl, and disposes of the sheriff and his car in the local river. Fillion also finds a lot of cash in the car, and some revealing pictures of the town's illustrious mayor (Daniel Baldwin). Things with the girl aren't quite what they seem, and before you know it, Fillion and his wife (Chandra West) find themselves in the middle of some messy coverup. A subplot reveals Fillion and West are now broke, due to the expenses incurred when their young daughter drowned, and life support was used to try and spare her life. The performances are credible, but Fillion's actions so unbelievable that it keeps the movie from achieving anything more than a standard thriller."
5,First rate acting,I stumbled across this movie and had just seen Fillion in Waitress. I enjoyed his acting for the second time. His stiff 'professional man in love' act was great in Waitress and his 'average man with moral compass and responsibility to his fellow man' act was right on target in this movie Waters Edge as well. I like watching an actor who can be an every man in many different stories. The story kept me intrigued enough to be entertained and I do hope to see Fillion make it big as he ages.
2,New dosing amount on Seachem website but not on the bottles,Bottle says add 16 drops to 10.5 gallons. Website says add 20 drops to 10.5 gallons. I understand that the company can not relable the product already out there but Amazon should update the product description or add a note of some sort.
5,Great book and quality service,"The book is a great companion to Suzuki 1. I teach violin, and have been wondering how I could incorporate better sight reading skills into the suzuki curriculum. This book does a great job. It was delivered quickly and in great condition. Thanks!"
2,not to good,This book was not what I wanted. It is to simple even for me even as a beginner. I do not like the way this book was described.
2,A joke...,"...and not in a good way. Some biting satire here and there, but a lot of really juvenile wordplay that a serious humorist would elevate away from...."
2,Pushing the limits of silliness,"I didn't think the book was all that funny. It's humor is outdated and pushes the limits of silliness sometimes. There was some entertainment, but all in all I would pass next time."
2,Wine-y Guy,"This kid could use some help. He has talent (he can play a guitar and sing fairly well), but he thinks singing about stupid stuff is cool. He seems to think that because he lives by the beach he is automatically cool and no matter what he writes or sings will have appeal. He should work harder at writing or cover good writers or keep busing at Chili's. His voice is a bit whiney and annoying that way, but I think he could break from that and actually do some pleasant stuff. Tommy...stay acoustic and work harder."
5,Can never go wrong with Husky Liners!,Can never go wrong with Husky Liners! They are great. Just bought our third pair for our third car... Does that tell you something?
5,My memories,"This show was one of my mothers favourites and now I have found this dvd I can sit and remember her her like yesterday and keep this for my grandkids and tell them it is part of the era gone by. I love this movie and it has many talented actors to make a classic of it. A moving action and musical that wont disappoint you and yes it is in black and white, but dont let that fool you it is worth watching with the talent of movie makers of the past."
5,enlightening,A great book. What is also funny is that homeless people in New York will sell you this book for a buck fifty. Or you can buy it here for 10 dollars
5,iStudioLink,"This is a simple converter, but it's working very well. I use it to connect my guitar to an old powerbook g4, and I've had no problems."
5,Works great!,"Works right out of the box, just plug it into the computer- as long as you plug it through a pedal or other power source (the product doesn't tell you that it's needed). Once it's plugged in, it works like a charm and sounds good on the computer."
5,Great to plug guitar into Mac for Garageband,I had previously bought a cheap connector from our local Fry's store - while it works the socket wasn't really long enough for a guitar plug so had a poor connection. Some reviewers comment on this being an expensive product but in my experience you get what you pay for. This Monster cable is just the right size for working with your guitar plugged into the audio input of your Mac. You can leave it plugged into the computer and easily connect your electric guitar cable and play away. Highly recommend this product.
1,Did not work - Awful product,"First and last time to buy a Monster cable, product arrived DOA and I immediately returned it and didn't bother getting a replacement. I will be purchasing a different product instead."
1,Guitar-to-Mac connector,"This cable works as advertised. However, it is very expensive. I found another connector that went directly from the 1/4-inch mono guitar cable to the 1/8-in stereo input required by a Macintosh. This connector was all one piece and so was without the 6-in or so cable between; but it was significantly less expensive."
4,guitar to computer,Wanted it to send guitar signal to computer and it works good. Got it on time. Must remember to turn up the required input line. The linux program I was using you also had to specify where it would get the signal from. That confused me for a while but that is no fault of the cable adapter. Was a little pricey.
1,WARNING 2012 MACS,Does not work with any 2012 Macbook Pros because the apple removed the audio input port. Not products fault but should not be billing itself as the iStudio if it does not work with apple products.
4,galaxie repair,"A polia é muito boa, só faltou pintura pois a pea chegou só com banho anti corroso, mas recomendo pois no Brasil no temos esta pea."
1,Bad Plastic,Cards arrived and 3 out of 54 arrived with a piece of the corner missing. This means that I cannot use these for poker as I intended. The plastic used in these is cheap and most likely acquiring a complete undamaged set is hard. Have used them sparingly due to the the fact that it is almost like playing with marked cards and no other cards have yet been broken or gotten damaged apart from the 3 that came chipped.
5,My Favorite Scrabble Resource.,"Great book for the serious Scrabble player. It takes a bit of practice learning the format and navigating through the book, but once that is mastered, it's a great resource for learning and adding Scrabble words to one's vocabulary."
5,Bob's Word Game Bible,"Great reference book, I use it every day. I even sent a copy to my sister - my opposition in the game Words with Friends"
5,Don't skip ahead to the ending!!!,"Okay, this book was not slow by any stretch. Matthew Costello gives very interesting characters and a plot that just moves along at a crisp pace. The plot involves some teenagers getting hold of an ancient book of black magic rituals and then attempting one on a lark. Well, something gets raised. Okay, there is tension, there are horrible deaths, regrets etc. I'm not a huge fan of horror, so when I say I really enjoyed this one, I am saying that this was a good read. Finally, there is the ending. There is a twist at the end of this novel that was just awesome. I can't tell you how darkly DARKBORN was heading, but... Well, I can't tell you where this is going because I don't want to give too much away, but if you read this novel, do not skip ahead to see how it comes out. This is a book that works up to one fantastic finish!!!"
5,Too Short!,"I will be reading this one again. Mr. Oliver's poetic and soothing prose lulled me into the story of his wonderful transformation from a ""seeker"" to an Orthodox Christian. His account of Valaam and Elder Raphael are like an afternoon recollection--as if I can close my eyes and share in his memories."
2,"Good idea for a book, but...","As a Roman Catholic monk, I was excited initially to see a book on the Russian Orthodox monks--especially since it seemed to be intimately written from experience. The writer, John Oliver, must be commended for his help to the monks. The book, however, lacks personality and intimacy. I wanted to hear more about the lives and stories of the monks! The author, repeating how much the monks have affected him simply does not say to the reader the specific ways he was challenged.Great concept for a book, but simply lacks good stories."
1,Steer Clear of this one!,"This book has too much general information, if your new to dns and want to read more about it, this may be a good book for you.If you are implementing windows 2000 server into your network, and need help with the MANY THINGS that can go wrong, go with MS windows 2000 DNS by Kevin Kocis. I bought this book based on the good reviews listed. Technical books, in general, appear to be outdated when they come out.... I have relied more on usenet, and microsoft's homepage to troubleshoot technical problems on dns and other issues. By the way, if your having trouble with slow logons, your dns isn't working correctly. I believe this is due to permissions problems on the dns server."
2,"Good Information, but Terrible writing","I have read most of this book and have found the information valuable, but very difficult to read. There are a tremendous amount of sentences that you have to reread, b/c of the complex sentences used. Technical books can be hard enough to digest without having to wade through a sea of poorly written sentences."
4,home renovator,"I really like the door knocker. It looks great on my front door. Although this knocker is for an apartment and is smaller then I expected, I used it for the front door of my single family home. I had painted the door a lovely coral color and polished the existing brass mail slot. When I mounted the new knocker, I was thrilled that I could screw it on right into the existing holes left from the previous black door knocker. I did not want a knocker that screwed from the other side of the door so I was pleased to find this one that screwed from the front. Along with my brass kick plate, the door looks very expensive. I do recommend it for a nice touch."
1,cheap cheap!,"I should have known- the price was pretty low. But the Solid Brass is MISLEADING! The thing is hollow. It may have a solid brass coating but with the hollow door knocker, it barely makes a noise when you use it. I was looking for a small solid brass door knocker because of space limitations and didn't realize this one would be so cheap!I think I will return but it will probably cost too much!"
3,Knock Knock,Screws could be longer. I found some gold colored screws from another door accent and used those. No one ever uses the knocker. Maybe I should have just bought brass knuckles and handed them out ot my visitors.
5,Book in Great condition,"Book came fast and is in excellent condition for a used book. Also, the price was right."
3,Ok. But not her best work,"I liked the book, but after reading What I loved my expectations were high and I was dissapointed.This is not as well written or as gripping.The book does potray succesfully the sensation of being in a constant dream: Characters do things because they feel compelled to, not because it makes any sense for them to do them. This is interesting for a while but it get's tiring fastSome characters are well built (Lily's neighbour, for instance, is a delight to follow) but the book in general does not match the intensity of other Hustvedt novels"
5,Excellent versatile little dril and light set,"the only reason I hesitate giving this a 5 star is because the batteries don't last forever. But I've had this for the last 6 years or so, and I love it. I only use it occasionally for light work around the house - I imagine if I was constantly remodeling my house, then I'd need something with a touch more power or battery life. I am certainly keeping this until it dies, and don't expect to replace it any time soon (I'm just visiting this page to say I own it and like it, so I can get recommendations in hardware). The version I bought came with 2 batteries."
2,Not all I'd hoped for.,"Okay, it's 50 movies...some very old, some very foreign, some good and some bad. That's what I expected. However, I did find more reasons to criticize than praise on this collection. Two of the movies would not play. They would start and freeze, sometimes moving a frame or two and freezing again. The one Tarzan's Revenge only played about three minutes and that was it. I tried three different DVD players and could not skip to a different scene or start at the back and use reverse to get into the movie. Also, Manhunt was a Rome release, not a movie with Don Murray. Bloody Friday was also nothing like the description and did not have the listed stars. Cheap is cheap, but come on, how hard is it to list the right movie? Are these things out-sourced to non-English reading or speaking countries? To sum up, there are some worthwhile shows in this collection, but I'm glad I waited until they were on sale. Had I paid full asking price, I would have felt cheated."
1,Collection of Bad B Movies,"This DVD collection consists of a combination of either unknown, unpopular or made for TV style B movies. Even some of the titles are misleading. The Fast and the Furious movie in this collection is not the 2001 version but the 1955 version instead. I thought that this collection would contain some ""popular"" Action Classics, but instead it just contains just some bad B movies. Even though you may recognize some well known actors in some of the movies, these were not their well known film roles, but were just B movies that they starred in. Don't waste your money buying this collection."
3,no oscar winners here but some fun if you let it,i own many of these sets and i like most of them. this is a nice set of b thru z grade action movies from the golden age of hollywood. as always if good transfers and a list movies are what you are after then stay away.
1,Where the Action is (Not),"When buying a product, you expect a little bang for your buck. Unlike its counterpart Family Classics, Action Classics leaves far short of its mark. Although these movies are old, you expect quality. Unfortunately, the sound is barely audible and the movies grainy. You'd think that because they're on DVD, the quality would be better. The movies shown are low budget (B movies)with unknown actors and limited action. Need I continue ??INACTION in this case would be best served.Save your money for better things... Like a hot fudge sundae !!!"
4,"Splendid offering, particularly for the price!","If you're considering purchasing this set, I only ask you to recall the old adage ""you get what you pay for"". First a note about the packaging, each disc is double-sided and in a cardboard slipcase with a brief summary of the plot. There are no extras, though each film has a limited amount of scene selections.Of course, these films were not at all cleaned up (not picture-wise nor audio-wise) for the transfer to DVD. However, if they were, you would be paying three to four times as much. Keep in mind there *will* be some moments where a few lines of dialogue are inaudible or the picture contorts briefly. Even so, I've watched twelve selections so far and enjoyed them immensely.Granted, most of the films here could be classified as ""b-movies"". But if you're a fan of the golden age of cinema and have already seen all the classics (Casablanca, Joan of Arc, Citizen Kane, etc) - this set introduces you to some long forgotten hard-to-find gems."
3,Movie mis-identified,"The movie titled ""Manhunt"" in this set is not as described (a 1958 Western with Don Murray, also known as ""From Hell to Texas""). It is instead a one-star 1972 Italian gangster movie with Henry Silva and Woody Strode, originally titled ""La Mala ordina,"" shown full-screen in uncorrected CinemaScope. But at less than 35 cents per movie, does it matter? There are enough gems in this set (e.g., the 1920 silent ""Last of the Mohicans"" with Wallace Beery) to make it well worth buying."
2,still born action flicks hurt this collection,"i own many of these 50 movie packs and i like almost all of them,but this collection is one that just doesn't do much for me.the movies collected here are of the grade b thru z movies and action is the one thing that is in short supply in the set. some are so bad that they are funny but most are just plain bad. and for once i have to say that i found the transfers to be very poor as some of the movies are almost unwatchable. while most of these sets are very much worth the price this set isn't worth even half the price that they are asking for."
2,Not really action movies.,"This is not ""50 Action Movies"" as much as it is ""50 Old Mostly Bad Movies We Had Laying Around and Thought We Could Package and Sell Somehow"".Still, many of these movies are unintentionally funny and make good MST3K fodder.Some are unbelieveably surreal. Like ""Funeral for an Assassin"""" which is a South African movie in which we are expected to root for the Apartheid govt. I found myself hoping that the assassin would wipe out the entire South African Apatheid govt, but alas.......Some are just plain awful. Like ""Submarine Alert"".But there's an Ed Wood classic included...""Jail Bait"". Always good for a laugh.I'd say the 50 movies are worth the money but just keep in mind that a good half of this set are unforgiveably bad movies and not even enjoyable for the laughs. They should have included ""Gigli"". It would have fit right into this set."
4,I enjoyed reading this book,"All I ever knew about Hannibal was that he crossed the Alps on the back of an elephant. Reading this book, not only did I learn a lot about the character of Hannibal and the political relationships of the mediterranean countries at that time, but I also really enjoyed reading it. There is no need to be a passionate of the genre. The book is well written and quick to read. I dived into the action and before I knew it, I wase already half way through. I am definitely planning to read Rafael Scott's next book."
2,Beware!,This is the BIGGEST night light I have ever seen...why does it need to be so large? Check the dimensions to be sure it will fit where you want to use it...so large it blocked the doors on my medicine cabinet! Otherwise it is attractive but a version half this size would be better.
5,the perfect weekender and a great addition to my rollaway suitcase,"love this bag - holds shoes, pajamas and other essentials for a long weekend away all in one bag. unpacking is a breeze- just hang and unzip!"
5,Bible...for the Bible!,"This Bible Dictionary is a ""Bible for the Bible!"" I have it by my side to refresh my memory as I'm reading...I'd say it is the handiest quick reference I've ever seen...it is written in very simplistic language so anyone can understand and get the true value of what it describes and represents!"
1,Disappointment,We've had this shed for 3 years. The doors and sides fall out of the base. We've put this shed together 3 times and now my husband has it 'held together' with a large rope. I'll buy another shed...but not a Rubbermaid.
1,Falls Apart Easily,"I was so excited until I opened the box. I had to find the instructions online since none were provided. Easy to put together? no. It took 2 of us just to try to hold it together, while a third person set pieces in place. Every time the wind blows, this shed falls apart. Every time you try to open a door, it falls apart. I had it taped together, but that didn't last. Spent a lot of hard earned money to throw this product in the garbage 2 months later...."
4,Rubbermaid 3749 storage shed,"Assembly was done in minutes,The doors do rub on the bottom when trying to close them.Used some silicone and that helps."
3,Storage shed okay,"Be advised......this storage unit does NOT come with shelves. I saw pictures with shelving, so I automatically assummed the shelves came with it. The description does not say that the shelves are not included. Luckily, my husband is so handy that he made the shelves for the cabinet. Also, the box that the storage unit comes in has the smallest print you can imagine that says shelves are not included. Other than that, the storage is adequate."
5,rubbermaid 3749,This shed was just what I needed to get my garden tools out of sight and out of the weather. It goes together easily with just a rubber mallet. With free shipping and a $25.00 Amazon gift card I paid only $104.00. I've seen it advertised elsewhere for almost $200.00.
3,I love Rubbermaid...,"I don't know what it is, but I love Rubbermaid stuff. Totes, ice cube trays, drinking containers, etc. When I saw they made this shed, I was excited because I know Rubbermaid quality is pretty good.However, I'm still not sure how I feel about the tab-lock construction for this shed. The whole thing assembles like a puzzle, but the plastic tabs don't inspire confidence. For my needs (indoor pantry), it's fine. Not sure I'd trust it in a location with high winds.It assembles easily in minutes. Easier with two people, but can be done with one.As others have stated, there are no shelves included."
4,Nice For Small Storage,"I mainly bought this to put my reel lawn mower in and it works great. Also able to store a couple more items too. I'm a ""senior"" citizen and put it together myself (but I am pretty handy!)OLD JACOB (The ""Old"" Adventures of Hailey and Jared #1)"
4,Upright storage for yard,Fairly easy to put together. Definitely need two people. The notches for adding shelves are not that defined.
4,Very good product!,"I am a 68-year-old woman with almost no mechanical experience or expertise and I was able to get this shed together by myself in less than 30 minutes (a little more than the 15 minutes the box said it would take, but still a respectable time).The box states that no tools are needed and the instruction sheet specifies that a rubber hammer is needed. I had a rubber hammer; it was helpful but I probably could have gotten the shed together without it. You need a flat surface at least eight feet long and five feet wide, and a wall or other solid surface to push against.The assembled cabinet is sturdy and very nice looking. I reccomend it."
2,bad side panel on discontinued product,The door reinforcement pockets in right hand side panel were bubbled outward causing a finger width gap between door and right hand panel. Makes it easy to force the door and gain access to the content.I was told to return the product to Amazon by Rubbermaid Customer Service as it has been discontinued and they can no longer provide replacement parts.Otherwise it's good shed.
3,No shelves?,I was disappointed to discover that the cabinets did not include shelves. My husband had to buy some plywood and make me shelves so I could use the new cabinets.
2,will not last,"This product does not hold together very well. Will not last long term. Rubbermaid 3749 Vertical Storage She, 17-cubic ft"
3,Rubbermaid storage shed,I was very happy with this product considering it was used. The shelf was missing though & I thought you could have put that in your discription.I recieved it in a timely manner.
2,Too expensive,"You can get a shed a lot cheaper other places. look around and find one for $99.Also, they need to list height, width and depth. Who thinks in terms of cubic feet, and even if they do, those cubic feet could be in any configuration."
2,Disappointing,"And just plain annoying for the most part. The lyrics sound as if they handed Bernadette Peters one of those ""men are beasts"" self-help books and told her to sing it to the audience. Also, you know the score is skimpy when they have to repeat the same melody three times before the end of the overture.There are a few bright spots--like the charming mother/daughter duet ""Don't Follow in My Footsteps"" and the junk food anthem ""2 Good 2 Be Bad""--but I don't think they're worth the cost of the whole album. Maybe go to Rhapsody or Itunes so you can download just those songs."
1,"Perhaps Bernadette's worst musical, if there were one!","This is horribly revolting! The only reason I bought it was out of shere curiousity on how this Neil Simon masterpiece could have been musicalized with one of my all-time favorites, Bernadette Peters, at that! Well, I couldn't even finish the album, because it was just plain silly. This is the real bravo out there for short-run Broadway musical recordings. Get the bootleg of Carrie instead!"
3,"Original Broadway cast recording of ""The Goodbye Girl""","I saw ""The Goodbye Girl"" twice while the show was in previews in Chicago, the second time just before it was headed for New York. Despite all of the talent involved, it was not a great show, and closed once Ms. Peters' and Mr. Short's contracts expired.I am not necessarily a fan of Martin Short, but he was terrific in the show, and the recording reflects it. ""The Goodbye Girl"" was an attempt to make Ms. Peters' image a more contemporary one. Some of her songs have very awkward lyrics which unfortunately were not worked out by the time the recording was made. She had been, and would be, in much better shows before and after ""The Goodbye Girl.""""The Goodbye Girl"" is probably a better candidate for a smaller theatre group or high school or college musical groups than as a Broadway show. I suspect it will be periodically used for just that purpose, and if so, the recording will assist future singers and actors."
1,The album is great but the LP....,"The album is great but the LP is bended, and very poor quality, and also i can not return the item because i'm living in a foreign country and the returning shipment will be like the money i paid for the LP."
3,Historically interesting,"First of all, some people will probably find these stories inherently offensive. They're all about ancient African cities created by enlightened and cultured white people, and they say that black people didn't do anything except move into the cities after the white people left. If you can stomach reading that, though, they're reasonably interesting adventure stories. A great deal of the plot points seem hackneyed, but these stories were written 100+ years ago, so really it's other people copying Haggard that make them seem so overdone. I liked the ending of Allan Quatermain, especially."
4,fun stuff,"good bang for the buck, fun, lightweight, escapist reading: just right a warm day, a shady tree and a crisp apple"
4,They don;t write'em like this anymore,"A great, set of adventure novels that can be enjoyed by kids from 9 to 90. Clear and easy to read, and the stories are great fun and hair raising adventures - the original Indiana Jones!"
