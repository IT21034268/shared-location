5,A timely and refreshing viewpoint,"This book isn't designed to destroy these women as other reviewers say, it points out their hypocrisy. For instance, Lynne Cheney's novel speaks of condoms as a liberating device to allow women (and men) low-risk pleasure, yet her husband and his boss deny these life-saving condoms in Africa where AIDS is killing the population in mind-boggling numbers. If you don't see the hypocrisy in that, don't bother with this book, it requires critical thinking skills and an open mind."
1,No new material here. . .,"If you hate President Bush and his administration, you might get ""good feelings"" by reading this book. Otherwise, no new ground covered here.For conservatives like myself, you might want to read this book just to remind yourselves that there are people who will do and say anything to discredit President Bush and his supporters--yes, their hatred runs that deeply."
5,Outstanding Power Protection,I have been using Panamax products for 20 plus years - needed in Florida - to protect my electronics from power surges that we often get with thunderstorms. I have never lost any equipment that has been connected to one of their products and this latest one is being use on our computer. I would recommend their products to anyone looking for a quality item at a reasonable cost.
4,not bad,"The book is not a bad read but it has a bias about the ""British Empire"". At one point the author stated that England brought ""civilization"" to India. Seens to me India had a civilization while England was still in mud huts."
2,Surreal History,"After reading this book, especially on the Battle of Teutoburgerwald (AD 9), I was puzzled as to why it was considered a classic. Apparently, I am not alone in this opinion -- W. S. Gilbert mocked the book in Major General Stanley's patter song in the Pirates of Penzance. Schooled in the Edward Gibbon type of history, the author twists facts and interpretation to glorify the Anglo-Saxon ""race."" While this can be taken with a grain of salt and used to generate a chuckle or two, its value as serious history is overrated. Because of its definite bias, while the book should not be avoided, it also should not be used as an introduction to the subject, nor, especially, as the student's sole exposure to military history."
1,British point of view - ONLY,"This is British rating of the battles. Nationally biased, thus of little historical value!"
3,Interesting to see how military history writing has evolved,"The accounts of the battles in this book have been done better in the 150 years since this book came out, so the unique quality of this effort is in seeing how the craft of writing battle narratives was performed in the 19th century - my understanding being that this was a long standing bestseller. The flavor of the times is best revealed through editorial comments where this British author lets his biases show with flowery, chauvinistic language common of that age. The impact on Western Civilization that each battle had is duly noted time and again. His lament over the Saratoga Campaign in the American Revolutionary War makes particularly fun reading; one almost wishes authors were not so careful to avoid offending people these days. He does end the book with a dramatic, feel-good ending at Waterloo, written only 20 years after the fact"
4,Pretty Good Book on the subject,I find the book having some good information about the units. I just wish they had more color illustrations of unit markings of the aircraft.
5,I can't get these songs out of my head.,"This band sounds like a harder and grungier Squeeze. I saw them play at Brownie's in NYC and picked up the CD at the show. The first song has been boppin' in my head since I played it. If you like pop and rock and roll, you've got to try this album of awesome ditties."
2,You could do so much better.,"""Take Her To The Zoo"" is a seven song EP from Albany newcomers the VodkaSonics. The experience of former Subduing Mara bassist Brendan Slater and former Bloom drummer JJ ""Hollywood"" Hogan can't make up for the obvious inexperience of singer/guitarist/songwriter Seth Powell. These sound like they were probably the first seven songs he ever wrote, and the hooky basslines only attempt to disguise the near-total lack of personality in the rest of the music. I guess we can only hope that Powell goes out and listens to some Elvis Costello and the Attractions records (as Slater clearly has) before he writes his next record. There is a bright spot or two (hence the extra star). ""Knock Me Down"" is actually a bright , hooky pop tune that will more than likely stick with yoy, but from there on, you'll notice the similarities in each and every song. Sorry, guys, but you could do so much better."
2,Disappointed..,"I think these must have been seconds, although i don't remember it saying that.On many of them, you could not remove the paper covering the adhesive partwithout ruining the bandage...just didn't seem to cut right..Will not buy from them again."
4,Brawo,"4 1/2Area is one band you could never accuse of misrepresenting the oft-abused progressive label. This is a group constantly and consistently on the cusp of compositional lunacy, backed by unshakable foundation. That rare combination of excess and progress makes this double disc compilation phenomenally listenable for highly adventurous music lovers."
4,Great Debut Album,"Wow! I have been waiting for someone to follow Papa Roach and start a new style of music. Fingertight has done it and it sounds great. These guys know how to evolve and bring out new, hard-hitting songs! You can really hear the strength and fury to their music. These guys are great on the CD and are even better in concert. I see them going big in a year. Watch out Trapt, they are coming after you! Buy this album or any other release by Fingertight."
5,the best the east bay has to offer,"what to say about this band, this cd. they have come a very long way from the small town of martinez, california. i knew them in high school and they had a lot of heart and loved music. they are awesome live and you should take the time to see them. but this cd is exactly what you would expect from these new comers to the main stage! they have it all and i recommend that everyone who has passion for rock music to listen to this bad boy. enjoy!925 shout out! yea!!!ahs"
3,It's ok,"Only bought this album here to fill a gap in my collection. It has one good song, the rest are so so"
2,thuroughly disappointed,"i had heard the demo back in 2001 and was blown away by ""bellevue"" and ""satori"".but what happened?ah yes,fingertight felt they needed to be heavier to fit in and it killed their original sound.""bellevue"" was a masterpiece song b4 ITNOP, but it has been hacked too many times to sound good anymore.please go back to the nice mellow rock you guys started with-it's what made you sound different than most of the crap out there."
2,Who knows?????,I wouldn't know if it was good or not. The guy that was selling it ripped me off. Took my money and I NEVER received the CD!
4,Surprisingly good,"The number one complaint that I have heard so far is that the band doesn't sound original. But really, with the exception of the next great band, who is original? The songs on here are quality. They are great for spacing out during a car trip or something. There is nothing on here that will deeply effect your life, but there are some good songs on here none the less. ""Shut up"" and ""emo this"" come to mind. If nothing else look at it this way, they aren't overly popular so if you know about this band then you must be into the alt/rock scene. So for a good album by a band that can play and sing, why now just pay the quarter for it used. You won't regret it."
5,You'll think its July on the Carolina Coastal Plain.....,"I'm writing this review in December in the Smokey Mountains. Winter got you down? Need a little kiss from a Summer Night?Frog Song may be the CD for you. I purchased this a few years ago at the beach in North Carolina. I fell instantly in love. It really does make you think you're near a cypress swamp in coastal NC. Relaxing and hypnotic are the two words that come to mind. Speaking of mind, you really can have summer all year long....mind over matter.There are other treats here also. Beside the frog songs you'll hear the Common Loon and Canada Goose among others in the backgrounds of some of the tracts. There are enough frog songs on enough tracks to take you into a deep sleep which is the point correct? Its fun trying to identify all of the wild life.You'll love this one."
4,Well done...,"Over all, very well down. To me it seemed like it was missing something, just not sure what. Still, the best frog sounds on the market."
1,Horrible Fluids Book,"I had Prof. Shames for junior level fluids, and this book in his series of mechanical engineering books does him no justice. It is very hard to understand, especially for the beginning fluids student (ME or CE). If you have to have the book for class and to do homework from, check it out from your school library and go buy another fluids book to study from!"
4,Sydney&#65533;s First Mission,"This is a fun read for Alias fans, telling of Sydney's first mission to Paris and how she got a crush on Noah Hicks."
2,This is not my Alias...,"Sydney is sent on her first official mission, yanked out of her normal life to go to Paris and surveil a suspected K-Directorate operation with Noah Hicks.I don't think Roberts saw the same Alias that I saw. From the start of the book, nothing seemed quite right: SD-6 sent Sydney on a mission with no knowledge about what she was going to do. Sydney was over-the-top ignorant and naive. Noah was completely out of character; in the show, he has a temper, sure, but he fights authority, he isn't a bully. I started cringing every time he had dialogue.The best part was the very end, the last three pages, though it's not so amazing as to be worth the rest of it. On the up side, the book only took about two hours to read."
4,quick read,"this was a quick and easy entertaining read. More for the interest of teens, but I still enjoyed reading it."
4,ok,"thought the book was good though in a different way from the rest of Robyn Carr books. I felt that perhaps a little more ""trashy"" but not necessarily in bad way. I have still recommend to others"
5,Very good book,"All of Robyn Carr's books are good, especially her Virgin River series. I would recommend all of her books. She is a good writer."
3,Too Long...,"I liked this book. It was funny, it had some suspense, and it was nice. I have read better books though. It was too long, it just kept going on and on and on. The most funny part i think is when she goes home and dances and yanks her clothes off - not thinking of the open windows -and her neighbor (who was mowing the lawn) saw her. She finally saw him and screeched and ran into the bedroom (his jaw was dropped to see such a sight). I thought that part was hilarious - it was great. He is a good character and he is the typical boy next door (wears his heart on his sleeve)love it."
3,From the Back Cover...,"With Arnaud torn from her arms, stricken with leprosy, Catherine, Countess of Montsalvy, disguises her golden beauty to seek vengeance against La Tremoille, enemy of her family and her country. Whether clothed in Sumptuous mourning, gipsy rags, boy's attire, or naked, with the ardor and strength of her young body, her lovliness is at once her keenest weapon and her greatest danger. Many men fall in love with her during her adventures in war torn fifteenth-century France, but after exacting a terrible revenge on her sworn enemy, Catherine forsakes everything to seek Arnaud."
2,Not Highsmith's best; skip it,Highsmith's writing is usually far more entertaining and clever than this novel would let you believe. She doesn't do herself justice with this one. Pick up a collection of her short stories instead.
2,Maybe I need to try another one ...,"After all the hype Highsmith got when the Ripley movie came out, I was intrigued. This was the only one I found at the library, so I went with it. It was fine, just not particularly gripping. Can't say I'd recommend it, although I'll give her books another shot, probably with one of the Ripley books."
2,Highsmith weakest work.,"I'm one of Patricia Highsmith biggest fan and I have read almost all of her work. Found in the Street is one of her last novels, and maybe its her weakest one. This tale of a married couple who fall for the same woman, can't compete with the sexual tension of her earlier novel: The Talented Mr. Ripley. Patricia Highsmith is a writer who must be read, but to fully appreciated her you must read the Ripley's books; A dog's Ramsom; People who knock on the door; or strangers on a train. You can forget Found in the street."
5,Something different,"My current boyfriend shared this cd with me. I'm not hispanic and by no means fluent in the language, but I understood most of the lyrics. I think this cd is great. It has good rhythm throughout and is relaxing for the most part. I think most people would enjoy this cd even if they don't understand what is being sung."
3,M&M Wild Things Coaster,The picture was wrong for the item. It showed that the front was silver & it was actually blue. I returned the product.
2,Not so sturdy!,"This toy had some great reviews, so I thought I would give it a shot. It took my Basenji 15 minutes to have the stuffing out of it and tear off the ""ears"". She certainly had fun with it, but it is not indestructable...at least not for Basenji's! It wasn't a total waste because I save the stuffing and buzzer and re-stuff the toy, so she can enjoy unstuffing it. At least she's not eating the poly stuffing! Maybe just the wrong toy for my dog."
4,Cat Fish again...,"This is the second catfish we have bought. The first wasn't so popular with our dog, but became the favorite toy of my friend's Akita. He carries it with him everywhere. His sister (cat) pottied on his so many times they had to throw it out. This purchase was a replacement.The toy itself is incredibly well made. The fabric is a tough thick canvas. I can't tell you what is inside because none of the dogs have managed to tear them apart. Whatever it is, it crackles like plastic wrap every time the fish moves. The squeaker is just a bonus.I highly recommend this toy for hours of chewing fun."
5,Wonderful Book,This beautifully illustrated book captures the essence of what makes summer cottaging so enjoyable. The settings are perfect for magical experiences & memories.
3,WELL,"iT'S OK BUT VERY SHORT.AL'S WORK IS CERTAINLY NOT UP TO PAR WITH HIS BEST ON DYLAN'S ""POSITIVELY 4TH ST"".MIKE BLOMFIELD IS NO STEPHEN STILLS ON ""SEASON OF THE WITCH"""
3,Not as good as the Live Adventures,"All the reviews I saw in Amazon rave about this set but I didn't like it so much. Now mind you, I believe everyone should own everything Bloomfield ever recorded and it is real nice to have something ""new"" to hear but the sound and the music didn't turn me on like the original Live Adventures from the west coast show. It is awful nice to hear the Jonnie Winters bit on this but on the whole the album isn't as hot as all that."
4,Can listen to some cuts over and over...,"This is a must have CD for Bloomfield/Kooper fans. I was a little disappointed by some of the seemingly out of place tunes (feeling groovy? Season of the witch?) but the guitar work is killer and its live and crisp.'One Way Out' kicks things off with ferocious guitar work. *****'Intro to Johnny Winter'... historical *****'Its my own fault' Excellent *****'Please tell me partner. Bluesy, slow, 10 minute jam. Bloomfield showing the limitations of his vocals but still a vintage and electrifying piece of guitar work. Wamba-jamba. *****'Thats all Right'. Thats alright mama. *****'Together till the end of time'. Very dated. They should have replaced this with another Johnny Winter cut. Slow, melodramatic, romantic? Nausea. **'Don't throw your love on me so strong' Yet another fantastic bluesy hard driving guitar tune albeit suffering only from Mike's vocal limitations. But man can he play guitar.I'd keep 5 of 10 songs for a personal custom cd..."
1,god bless al kooper,god bless al kooper for finding this concert in the columbia vaults. It is worth triple the price for the Michael Bloomfield and Johnny Winter collaboration on It's My Own Fault. This reviewer rates this cd 5 stars plus if possible. It actually gets airplay on Las Vegas Blues radio.
3,Bloomfield and Winter make this worth having,"Blame Kooper for putting together the erratic rhythm section, and particularly for choosing drummer Johnny Cresci. Cresci was actually a decent jazz drummer whose recordings include backing singers such as Lena Horne, Bobby Short, and Helen Merrill - but he was completely wrong for this type of music, and obviously had little idea how to play it. This album would have been far better had Kooper selected a decent rock/blues drummer. To be fair, though, Kooper had allowed only two days for rehearsal, half as much as the band on the first Bloomfield/Kooper live album; as Cresci is noticeably better on ""(Please) Tell Me Partner"", the second slow blues of the set, I suspect that a couple more days of rehearsal would have made a real difference in his playing and the band's as a whole. As it is, though, this album is still worthwhile for the great guitar playing from Bloomfield and Winter."
5,Bloomfield Forever,"This CD contains some of Mike Bloomfield's guitar hero work. He was the BEST white blues guitarist of all time (with Peter Green being a very, very close 2nd). When Bloomfield was 'on' no one could touch his playing."
2,"Drummer completely ruins the slow blues, unbelievable......","I love Mike Bloomfield, was thrilled to hear about this recording and immediately ordered it. What a great dissappointment! The drummer is so incredibly bad it is hard to believe that he was not dragged off stage in mid song. Fabulous numbers like ""Don't Throw Your love on Me so Strong"" are completely ruined. He has NO CLUE about slow blues groove, seems completely lost and actually goes into waltz and cut time!! I am not exaggerating. The worst recorded case of incompetence I have ever heard. The bass player gives up after a while and just follows. It is amazing that Bloomfield was even capable of playing with such sabotage, a testament to his great musicianship. Very unfortunate for what would have been a great addition to Bloomfield's recorded work. Hard to listen to. I recommend that you check out the fabulous ""My Labors and More"" from Nick Gravenites for some of the best recorded examples of Bloomfield live that are still available."
2,little to no direction,"This was a required book for a college course, and it left a lot to be desired. It provides little to no direction for criticizing photographs. It really is all about a single person's preferences. I'd pass on this book unless you have to get it for a class."
2,Goes on and on,"Includes miles of intellectual blather. Fits well into sexually charged point of view of photography. Uses most horrific and grotesk as examples. On page 33 in third edition author mentions head decapitation as one photographer's ""external"" influences. Uses sexual pictures as examples. Generally a politically correct lightly negative type discourse on photography. I feel sorry for the students subjected to this pulp."
2,a little dry,"this book has a lot of great reference and good points, but drags on. the author could easily say what he is trying to in a paragraph or two, but goes on for pages and pages"
2,Not Recommended,"This book was require for my college level digital photography course, but I felt that it did not do an adequate job of explaining the concepts it covers. The book is dull and merely lists other photographs as examples (they are not included in the text)."
2,my experience,I find it very hard to read.I expected to find a book that explained how to critize photo work of other people.
1,Criticizing Photographs,"I gave this book a low rating, not because of how well it was written or it's content but because it was a polar opposite to what I expected. My fault for misunderstanding the content although the title is misleading.I bought this book with the expectation to improve my photographic technique by understanding what a professional photo critic and evaluator looks for in a photograph.I felt that this book was more of a ""how-to-be a professional photo critic"" than a 'how-to-evaluate photographs"" book.The book was a bit too philosophical and esoteric for my needs."
2,Expected Better,"I purchased this flute hoping it would be what it appeared -- a mid-priced student flute that would get my daughter through her middle school and high school band classes. (At which point, if she still wanted to play, I might invest in a better quality instrument for her.)Unfortunately, it fails to perform. As the music teacher who posted a review commented, we've had repeated trouble with the keys. (Including once just before a band competition!) In addition, it is not in tune -- in order to get it to concert pitch she has to pull the head joint out almost a full inch, which is really NOT acceptable.If the student plans to only play solo pieces, and has someone available to do the necessary adjustments on the keys, it might be a reasonable option. But for a band, even a student level band, it just doesn't do the job."
5,Wolf in teacher's clothing?,"Here are a few verifiable facts:1. The Hamlin Silver Flute was the best selling flute on Amazon.com last year, with hundreds sold.2. The number of these flutes returned for a refund is zero! That's 100% customer satisfaction! Not a single customer chose to take advantage of the Amazon.com satisfaction guarantee.3. Yes, I am Mark Nicewonger, the head of Hamlin Music Products, and unlike others who write reviews, I'm not afraid to let you know who I am."
5,Its pretty good,well after waiting for awhile i finally got it and it came well nice and stored also it plays wonderful. it is totally worth it. A+
4,"Great product, don't get them wet!","To be honest, these bandages aggravate me. It seems like my hands are almost always in water and these guys, well, just fall off when they get wet. There's no water sparing on this product at all and when you're a busy mom with a cut or something on your hands, you need something that's going to stick. You can always tell whenever I have a cut because there are bandaids all over the house that have fallen off unnoticed. Otherwise, they do a good job in protecting wounds."
5,the perfect slow jam,"damn, I just finished listening to this track and i still have it on repeat! with a colloboration between one of the biggest soul stars of europe and the unforgetable wutang member RZA we all knew that this track would be hot, however the word 'hot' under estimates it. no typical rza beat, but for anyone who likes real soul and chill rhymes this is for you! xavier naidoo got one of the most beautiful voice on earth and he adds a great deal of soul to this track. this track is a cross of rap, r'n'b and soul and the way in which it has been done is fantastic. this is definitely one of the most soulful, beautiful songs that I have heard for a long time and it is definitely worth buying. so: BUY this CD!"
3,This is a WORKBOOK!,"While the text in the book is helpful and knowledgable, this is a STUDENT WORKBOOK! My boss bought this for me to help me with my DANB test. Low and behold, as soon as it arrived we realized that this was a workbook and not a textbook. We reviewed the book description and nowhere did it clarify this."
3,A Worthy Quick Introduction,"This book was an easy and quick read. The breakdown into the four chronological periods, broken down into four main chapters, is clear and to the point. After reading, I recommend going to the bibliography and reading some of the main works cited there for a more in-depth perspective. My only reason for giving the book 3 stars are the somewhat dated and also the limited number of works cited in the bibliography. Given the publication date of the original hardback (2000), I would have expected many more recent works."
2,Tolerable but boring...,"In contrast to the previous reviewer, I don't find this album to be utterly dreadful. My church doesn't have a bell choir, so I find the sounds of bells to be utterly captivating. Even so, this album is far from what it could be, based on my limited knowledge of bell choirs. Ultimately, many of the songs are painfully slow and very boring. And I was frustrated by the organ songs, as I bought this album to hear bells. Overall, there are worse Christmas albums, and I don't hate this one, but it was a significant disappointment."
4,"So far So good,would recommend/buy again","definitely pleased w/the product (but <1,000 miles so far). Quiet and efficient. Good price. Would recommend/buy again. Easy installation. Glad I made the purchase."
5,Love trumps Death - some magic and nothing spooky,"Peter Beagle is well known for his un-rivalled word magic. His highly regarded 'The Last Unicorn' is an absolute classic in its genre and he does it again in this wonderfully written story. It is simply a story of life and love and death (no spooks) and a bit of magic in a cemetery. No magic tricks, just a talking raven and the ability of one man to talk with the dead. So far, nothing that strains the ability to accept the story as presented. I had no such problem. Maybe my being a theoretical physicist is to blame for this. There are lines of un-common beauty in this book. Of the kind that make you think, I wish I could have said this. The story is original. You have never read anything like this. By the time you reach the end of this book only Love and some magic remain.I've re-read this book, cover to cover, about 10 times. I've re-read sections many more times than that. I would'nt lend my copy to anyone."
4,Surprising,"This was an... interesting... book. All right, basically I found it a rather a boring story, but a wonderful experience. It is very insightful, philosophical, and odd.It's about a ghost who decides to stick to his `ghosthood' as long as he can, and falls in love with another ghost.It's also about a man who has lived in the cemetery for 18 years, and finds it emotionally difficult to leave. He can see and hear ghosts, and is brought food by a crow (raven?).Good for a one-time read, this book will leave you feeling much more introspective than you previously were."
4,"""Haunting"" is a bad pun to describe this book...","...and yet that is precisely what the book is--haunting.Though a bit pessimistic for my personal taste, this tale of love beyond the grave is nonetheless original and interesting, with the Peter S. Beagle standard memorable characters and memorable quotes. (My favorite is the paragraph about eternity, as the characters sit around a bonfire.) This was Beagle's first book...not my personal favorite, but a good read nonetheless."
5,moms book,i ordered this for my mom-she said it was good we ordered off amazon because we could not get it around where we live in southwest pa
2,It was OK...,"Beagle uses an interesting premise for his book: the main characters are ghosts. That's the good news. It's downhill from there. Beagle's ghosts try to find a meaning in death that eluded them in life. Unfortunately, the character development remains shallow. You really want to get to know and maybe even like these characters. Beagle never gives you a chance. By the end of the book you don't really miss them. They fail to find any real truth about themselves, and the reader grows weary of waiting for something to happen."
5,aesthetically pleasing and useful,"This product allows the air to circulate around the fruit, slowing down the over-ripening process and keeping it fresh longer! When fruit just sticks to the bottom of a basket or plate, you can be sure that it is not getting good circulation, thus mold can occur, etc.But with this relatively inexpensive item, you will keep your family or office healthier by keeping your fruit healthier."
5,Functional and Great Looking,"I saw a similar chrome fruit basket in an upscale magazine and wanted to find one. My search led me to Amazon (which my searches usually do) and I liked the look of this one and the price wasn't too bad. The basket is well made and holds a lot of produce. It is large and quite tall. Probably won't fit on the counter under any cabinets. If there is any drawback it would be that the spacing of the chrome supports allow smaller foods to fall through (like small red potatoes, chili peppers, etc.). Overall it is great and I get lots of good comments on it."
4,2-TIER BASKET,"Love it. Separates fruit ripening at different stages. Holes big enough that small fruit (some mandarins, plums etc) can fall through, but perfect size for apples, oranges, bananas etc... One small annoyance is that it is a bit rickety, not all legs exactly same length, but it's slight so wouldn't put me off buying it again."
5,Chrome Fruit Basket,"Received this from UPS yesterday and I love it. It is really is quite tall but I have enough space from the countertop to the cupboard to handle the height. Love it, room enough for all our fruit. Wish that I had bought it sooner."
3,Phil Sheridan and his associate commanders.,"After Grant and Sherman, Sheridan rates as the most gifted Union General of the Civil War. However, Sheridan was a division commander until the last year of the war, when he became an Army commander. Sheridan's signal moment come in the Shenandoah Valley, where he exacted a revenge that burned the agriculture region for years to come. He beat up Early often, but never enough to cause the complete extinction of the Confederate Army in the Shenandoah Valley. His subordinates include George Custer, Wesley Merritt, and George Crook. Phil and these men had influence in the US Army until the 1900s. These were influential military men that determined the course of the US Army.This is an OK book about the last year of battles and Phil's associates. Phil Sheridan played a prominent role in the defeat of the Confederate States. This book shows the last year of battles and the men that played a role in Phil's fame."
2,A Pass,"While my kids do pull this out to play, a simple microphone hooked up to a cd player would be better. The sound quality is poor and the songs are not clasical children's songs that they know."
2,Leapfrog terrible customer service,"Got 3 years ago as a gift. The Karaoke microphone stopped working almost immediately. Multiple calls, emails to LeapFrog and all I can conclude is that there are no replacement microphones. Still, my 2 kids enjoy listening to the songs."
5,"35 years later, still love her.","I waited a long time for this to come out in a CD. I'm glad my wait is over. Taylor sounds as good as ever. I haven't stopped playing the CD, great drive music."
5,Sister Kate Taylor,"Quite a talented cast of characters assist in bringing out Kate's best. I played the LP version non-stop in 1971 and I'm playing it non-stop today. Thank you, Amazon, for the CD version! The fact that it was originally released almost 40 years shouldn't stop you from purchasing; My kids (in their 20s) love it. Check out Kate's recent release ""Fair Time"" and try to see one of her shows. She's as warm and vital in person as she sounds on this classic."
3,A Decent Story,"Of the five Ted Wilford stories I've read, this is probably the second best. The writer, Norvin Pallas, is meticulous in making sure these tales are logically sound. All too often authors of children's literature disrespect the readers' intelligence by having absurdities or mere coincidence as major parts of the plot. The one negative is that as dedicated to logic as Pallas is, his stories suffer from a lack of warmth and character development. These stories are no Ken Holts or Rick Brants but if one is bothered by the ""luck"" the Hardy Boys have in solving their mysteries, Ted Wilford offers a cure.Pirate Treasure of Cape May"
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY.....,"I saw the movie Rock Star and heard the Verve Pipe song ""Colorful"" and liked it very much.. kinda folky sounding.. had depth..so I decided to buy the CD Underneath..Colorful is the only good song on the CD if you ask me. I didn't like the rest of the CD at all.. Now I know why the seller said ""Only played once"" when I bought it used.. I had hoped the rest of the CD was as good as the song Colorful was.... Guess Not!!!"
2,Weak effort....,"With the long anticipated release of ""Underneath"" I was looking forward to something in the vein of ""Villans"", instead it's similar to ""The Verve Pipe"" their last disk that flopped badly. This record again is; over produced, too artsy, has no edge to it and doesn't provide lead guitarist A. J. Dunning the outlet to play anything more than ""filler"" leads. It's really unfortunate because The Verve Pipe are a talented band and ""Villans"" was a GREAT record. Too bad they didn't go back to their rock roots, the one's that got them here in the first place."
3,Quality Falling Off,"This is a decent album, but it does not come close to the energy and...yes, verve, of Villians and Pop Smear. Their lead singer seems to be losing his voice, there is no more of the passionate belt out singing so prevalent in the early recordings, the very thing that gives this music its strength and distinction. But then again I think the same thing about the album The Verve Pipe... Go listen to Villians and Pop Smear instead."
5,Underneath,"""Underneath"", strikes an intriguing balance between the bands previous two, more alt/grunge cds, and the earlier ""Pop Smear"", with its XTC meets early Elvis Costello pop sensibility. These are men who are unafraid to produce a great four minute pop song. In a world consumed with rap/metal and teen-pop that's a long overdue achievement.This is an album of superior craftmanship-buy it!"
5,It took a while to grow on me,"When I first listened to Underneath, I was disappointed. I guess I was waiting to hear Victoria or Cup of Tea or La La. When I finally had a chance to put on headphones and listen to this CD for what it is, I found it to be awesome. I don't think any other band comes close lyrically to TVP and this album is no exception."
1,More Farrington Than Darwin,"What would you expect from the title? -An explanation and summary of Darwin's work. You get that. But very lightweight. Fully a third of this tiny book is not Darwin, but Farrington. The author takes the last third to explain Darwin's inadequacies with so-called modern hindsight, but basically turns the 'flaws' in Darwin to bring the book around to almost a repudiation of Darwin's scientific method, so that muddle-mindedness and religion can creep in the back door. I looked for a quick, articulate summary of Darwin, and got Church of England stuff way after Bishop Wilberforce."
3,good intro doesnt give credit due,a good introduction to darwins thought.it points out many things that he was wrong on but it cannot be said as the author points out as darwin simply pushing on ideas of other people
4,great lectures!,"My whole family enjoyed listening to these lectures by Professor Elizabeth Vandiver. She has some wonderful insight into Greek culture, language, and history as well as the myths themselves. She discusses the original meaning of particular words in Greek, and emphasizes how translation often causes confusion or misinterpretation. We've listened to the whole series twice over and I'm sure we will go through them again."
4,DVD,I had hoped this would have been a longer series....but to no avail. There were some cute parts and some sad parts. This should have had a minimum 6 episodes I thought there was so much more to tell.
3,This book needed an editor,"It's an interesting story, with a lot of gossip and background on each of the Washington ladies profiled. But it sorely needed a good edit -- there were repetitions and unevenness that a good editor ought to have caught.OK book, but nothing to rave about."
3,"Good Book, Oddly Arranged","I learned a lot from this book about Washington and how Georgetown influenced American party politics. However, I found the arrangement odd -- greatly researched and well-organized at the beginning and poorly structured at the end."
2,Dinner Parties in Washington,"C. David Heymann found an interesting topic to write about. The women of Washington have been written about, but this book capitalizes on a less told part of Washington. Heymann talks about the parties given by some of the movers and shakers, including Katharine Graham, whose death he opens with. The author writes about the dinner parties and social events where deals were made and alliances formed, and the gossip that prevailed.While the author found a unique topic to write about, he found very little new information. The bibliography cites hundreds of books and articles, yet he lacks new interviews or original information. Heymann also relies upon quoted material frequently, which was disappointing. In all I found myself wanting more fresh information but he found a great topic to write about."
1,Boring!,"If you have read Katherine Graham's book ""Personal History"", then save your money and don't buy The Georgetown Ladies. It is almost as though Heymann took the words right out of Grahams Book. It took me forever to get thru this..... it was very boring and NO new news. One of the worst books I've ever read."
5,Excellent,"Sue Mosher's ""Teach Yourself Outlook 2000 Programming in 24 Hours"" is interesting and very informative. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to get started programming Outlook. The only area I am disappointed in is that , similar to Thomas Rizzo , she doesn't put an emphasis on the internet e-mail protocols. I know that is not the scope of the book. But that is definitely the direction both Outlook and Exchange are going. Just look at any discussions on Exchange 2000! You really need to complement this book with something like ""Essential Mail Protocols"" by Jennifer Adams or ""Programmer's Guide to Internet Mail"" by John Rhoton to cover all bases."
4,A Good Place To Start,"I found this book to be a good place to begin learning Outlook Programming. Mosher does a great job narrating a pretty dry subject. I found the code snippets to be correct and applicable (I still use some of the examples in my production code). If you want to learn about Outlook programming (and why you should program Outlook) this is the book to take you to the intermediate level. Subjects covered: form design, the VBA environment, coding basics, special Outlook techniques (Object Models, Custom Actions, Stores and Folders, Items, Events, Menus, Toolbars), debugging (a biggy), ActiveX and other controls, reports (some are pretty limited, but not the book's fault), and the author even touches on Exchange Server and Data Collaboration. A pretty good index ties things up nicely. This is not an advanced book or a reference, but a tutorial. A very good buy. No CD, but I found the code examples to be no big deal to type in...after all this is Outlook we are talking about!"
2,Useless if you're in a hurry,"I purchased this book after reading all the great reviews for it at this site, but found that it has been useless for my purposes. I need a few minor customizations to my Outlook client, and I don't have much time to spend. I am a fairly experienced hack, and usually pick up new programming concepts quickly, but I have found it impossible to extract key concepts from this book. Outlook 2000 Programming in 24 hours - no more, no less - and god help you if your project doesn't closely resemble one of the samples provided."
2,Not very informative,"I was terribly disppointed in this book. I have a project to design a software for taking attendance and calculating accumulated vacation days and sick days for my company. After reading this book, I still have no idea how to do this project. I expected to see a brief description of different objects and how to use them, but this did not happen.This book is really meant for people who use Outlook casually. If you want to develop softwares using Outlook, this book is not for you."
5,Need That book,"I need to buy Sams Teach Yourself Outlook 2000 Programming in 24 Hours Book, Where can I have it as soon as possible? Please let me know"
2,"no, thanks.....","Whomever edited this great song down to its 7"" version absolutely BUTCHERED it, the album version stands well on its own and could have been a hit as it is. And the dub versions just go nowhere. Avoid."
3,Nice hat,I like this hat except I have thick hair so it fits a little weird. Other than that I would buy this hat again.
3,"Not bad, but I expected more!","Most of the book is a wash by now. It could use a little updating. The book can be summarized into the following:Sites should be designed to allow for effective and efficient two-way communications between you and your clients... (that's my Cliff's Notes version of the book.)Everything else supports that main theme. It's all pretty superficial information. If you've read other Web Design Business books, you've already seen this information. I still like Jim Smith's book (How to Start a Home-Based Web Design Business) the best."
3,Half the book really interesting,"The first eleven chapters were very nice and useful to read. From chapter 12 on, I found it a bit boring.As the other reviews say, it has quite a lot of good tips and information about how you have to conceive a web-design business.But in my humble opinion the marketing chapters failed, they all ramble around the same concepts too many times without giving fresh ideas.From chapter 20 on it gained some new interest to me."
5,Pablo,"Pablo Milanes, one of all time great romantic song writers in Spanish music. Not a great voice but his renditions seem like singing poetry the verses cover a wide variety of emotions. Great Album."
2,Yawn,"Beast of Dreams was a real let down. I can only say that it read, for me, like directions, very tedious directions. There was no romance, no grab to the story and the characters were just plain childish in the interaction."
2,rabid reader,"i found this book booring and juvinile. the heroine reminds me of the early romance novels where they all have silver blond hair to their butts, perfect bodies,faces etc. the hero is nothing more than fur covered and does not act like an alpha male. the two have sex short and oh baby like a bad soft porn movie. the author's us of explicit language is trite and only there for effect i get the feeling she is uncomfortable using it.the writing just wasn't that good.almost no plot and a lot of i am woman with my own agenda, but i love you and will stay with you forever. on minute she is assertive the next she is all gooey.sorry i wasted my money. lora leighs breed novels are much better and sherelynn kenyens wolfs are more believable. try susan kearney's the challenge if you like futuristic.she is much better."
2,Watch it for Winterset!,"The 1936 movie is much better than the 1971 Yin and Yang of Mr. Go... In fact, that one is so bad that I think it's the worst movie I've ever seen that was not part of a MST3K collection. Jeff Bridges as a hustling Army deserter in Hong Kong; Burgess Meredith as a Chinese acupuncturist; James Mason as a Mexican-Chinese superspy who turns ""good"" when the Buddha shines his third eye on him to make him do a 180 from his evil ways; catfights and topless Chinese girls....if you want to see a really corny movie, Mr. Go is the one to catch!"
1,"bad product, worse customer service","I brought the product from best buy in chicago, after a month the laptop suddenly died on me, took it back to best buy, it took more than 3 weeks for the pc to come back, with all the data erased , apparently there was a problem in the mother board ( it seems this is quite a frequent problem with vaios the connection between the power supply & the mother board !).This my second vaio, I returned the first one which also developed a hardware problem,I thought that was bad luck but after problems in my second laptop it is sony not luck . I will never buy a sony again, the customer service stinks, they sell products at a higher price but have no customer service to speak of, any repair will take more than two weeks & u will waste atleast 2 hours on the phone just getting to the right person."
2,OK cover,This guard is ok. It doesn't velcro/attach to anything on the bottom of the stroller. It's worth the $10 I paid. I would definitely rather purchase a jogging stroller that had a weather guard attached to fit properly.
3,just ok,This cover is ok. It serves the purpose and covers my BoB mostly...it is a little snug...and it already has a tear in the seam by the handle bar area. I will keep it for now but will eventually just spend the money for the actual BOB cover...I got what I paid for this time...
3,VERY thick plastic,"This product works alright, but the plastic is so thick that the wrinkles are hard to smooth out so it looks pretty unattractive. It also makes it really hard to peel back when we don't need it since there's a huge bunch of plastic that looks really weird while I'm pushing it. I know I could just take it off & put it in the basket at the bottom, but it's a pain to do that, so I just pull it back & fold it as smoothly as I can, but it doesn't do that very well since the plastic is really stiff. It does keep my son dry, which is the point, so it gets 3 stars, but no more than that because of the other inconveniences. I have a Schwinn jogging stroller, so perhaps part of the problem is that it's just not meant for this particular shape of stroller. All in all, I'm fine with it at this price since it does the job."
4,"I loved it, and then it started breaking",This is really great for keeping the cold out on runs. We're currently training for a half marathon and have runs that are 1-2+ hours in length. Our son loves joining us and takes a long nap or looks around at the world as we run through it. We were getting worried about the dropping temps with Fall and Winter approaching but this cover really made it possible to continue training with him without fear of him being too cold. It fits the BOB Revolution really well without the hefty price tag of a true BOB cover. My only complaint (and why I gave it 4 stars rather than 5) is that it's begun to break (the velcro parts are starting to tear apart from the plastic). For the price though it was bound to happen I suppose and we do get a lot of wear out of it.
4,very good rain cover,This is very good rain cover. My daughter has been enjoying her morning walks/run. When inclement weather hits she is always prepared with this nice comfy cover. Keeps granddaughter dry and warm.
4,The best,"I use this for walking in cold or windy weather, i put some blankets around my boy and he stays nice and warm under the cover. The only con with this product is it is a little thin, if you leave it folded up in the cold weather and try to unfold it it may rip. But a quick warm up over a heater fixes that. I would recommend this item to anyone who likes walk in the cold."
2,the real enchilada,"if you want to read the real source, you should go to Guillermo Sheridan's books on Paz."
1,Save Your Money,"Very poorly done. Sloppy mess of a film. One would think that anyone making a film like this would understand that gays want to see good looking young men. Instead they focus on fat over-the-hill drag queens. The host sticks his nose right in front of the camera lens and has nothing worthwhile to say. The only excuse one can imagine, is that they were all too stoned to make a decent film. They have a few good shots of guys that look like they found there way into the film almost by accident. Surely Amsterdam has more to offer than this fort five minutes of embarrassingly amature video."
3,DVD Is Alright,"This review is not about the actual television show, because that is just awesome. But is about the actual DVD set itself.-There were a couple of spots where the audio was off sync with the video. I had to restart the video to get it to work right.-The extra features are decent. With a coloring page section for your PC and a brief bio of the main characters. However the opening music scene restarted for every bio, which made watching them all at once, very annoying.-The DVD menu music got old quick.I think for a quick DVD release with four episodes, it's decent. But not as extra feature filled as we MLP fans want. I hope they come up with a Season 1 DVD set soon."
4,Just as expected,"I bought this DVD mostly as a gesture to show that I have interest in buying Friendship is Magic on DVD in hope that one day a boxed set will be produced. The DVD itself is honestly not the best. Quality isn't great and the menus are pretty generic, although that should be expected for something like this. As a collector item I thought it was worth the small price."
3,Not what I expected,I bought this Jan 1st cause it said it was a preorder to come out on Feb 28th. I didnt see any reviews show up at that time and bought it thinking it was a new movie to go with the train set that came out recently. When I got it my kids where excited but when I put it in it was no more than a few episodes that I already have on my DVR. Had I known that I would have waited and just watched them on my DVR till they came out with a box set of some sort. I dont like to waste money on the dvds if they are just a few tv episodes at a time. With that said they are still good episodes however the old classic mlp eps will always be the best!
3,Just a few mid-season episodes,"I wouldn't spend a lot of money on this--it's not one of the finales or any special episodes, just a few regular ones. Kids would probably get tired of it after watching it a few times."
1,Very disappointed,"I was really looking forward to reading the newest book, I even read the excerpt from Wendy Wax's website. It sounded cute and had some great possibility. I should have just read the excerpt and saved myself some money and time.Shelley is your typical spoiled princess, daddy gave her a job and apparently one with very good money attached to it. She doesn't take anything serious until her father decides to hand over running the agency to her nemisis Ross. They have history, we don't really know why, there is no explanation about the ""supply closet sex."" They really don't interact,I would think in order to have some type of romance the couple should actually be in the same room together. There are so many characters in this book I would think you would need a program to keep them straight. There were just too many stories going on to really make this a good book. I will have to see if her next book is better. The other two reviews must be talking about a different book."
4,Laugh out loud funny,"If you enjoy a good sense of humor and a little attitude in your main charaters, you will love this book as much as I did. Yes, it was a little predictable. But, you usually don't read these kinds of books for their thrilling plots. Don't take it too seriously, sit back, and enjoy a comical and relaxing read."
4,humorous chick lit,"The story is focused mainly on the heroine and her attempts to prove to herself, her family and her new boss that she really can work hard in the family ad agency business. It's funny, it's a fast read and I enjoyed it a lot."
2,You can skip this one.,"I thought this looked good and the jacket sounded good so I bought it even though I haven't read any of Max's other books. I wished I had just found something else. The main character is so annoying and selfish that I couldn't like her. If you can't like the main character its sorta hard to read a book. The romance at the end sort of appears out of nowhere and you wonder how the poor guy could fall in love with this pathetic, selfish spoiled girl. Also, the parents manipulating her into falling in love with the guy by NOT mentioning that he is jewish was juvenile."
5,Maybe the best from one of the best bands out there right now,"If you are into the whole psyche-folk thing, (Animal Collective, Six Organs, Joanna Newsom, etc.) then WWVV are for you. If you haven't heard them already this is a great starting point and if you have heard them then get excited because it is great! Possibly their best, which I feel guilty about saying because it is the best recorded one and i don't want to betray my love of the low-fi asthetic, but it is great to hear such an intersting band in rich complex production.Track two may be the best song they have ever done, it is a really long improv thing that at seven and a half minutes becomes one of the most beautiful things i have ever heard.SERIOUSLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
1,Did not receive entire advertised quantity,"Everything that I saw on the web page said that there were two printer ink cartridges on this web page, but I only received one in the box that it came in. It really wasn't worth the price that was charged for it."
3,ok serial,"Foreigners (it's never specify what kind) are planning to destroy North America with missiles. It's up to Canadian forest ranger William Henry (who reminds me of William Holden) to stop them. New comer to serials Susan Morrow does an all right job as William's sidekick. Arthur Space is by the far best part of Canadian Mounties fooling the ranger with a dim wit persona named Smokey Joe. This is not an amazing serial, but it's passable. 2.5 rounded to 3."
5,An interesting insight into the air war,"Written soon after Desert Storm, this book, filled with pictures, explains the mission of each aircraft during each phase of the war.The author even explains the politics surrounding some of the aircraft and their missions."
2,Growmore Domolite Lime,"The product is advertised as powdered but what I recieved was granulated, about the size of rock salt. I specifically wanted powdered so it would break down faster in the soil, so I wasn't too happy with my purchase. I could have bought granulated Domolite Lime at Home Depot for a fraction of the cost. In my opinion Growmore should not be advertising this product as powdered."
4,I loved the new r & b touch....,"This is easyly the best Totally Hits ever, since they added a the r & b touch. I also like how they put on the songs that now left out! I still like my now 8 better, but thats a given. The only thing i really hate about this cd is how they took Alica Keys single and made it into a crappy remix. They should have put the origanal on. To sun it up, buy this if you want some r & r hits, but buy now 8 if you want rock.... It has Blink 182, Sum 41.... =)Of Couse, this has that terrific song by eve 6!"
5,Better Than The Previous Two,"This version of the ""Totally Hits"" series finally returns to the formula from the first in the series. Pretty much every song was a hit and they're pretty much up to date. My favorites being ""Get Your Freak On"",""Hit Em Up Style"",""I Wanna Be Bad"",""All Or Nothing"",and ""When It's Over."" I think they probably should have put on the original ""Fallin'"" (although it is VERY overplayed)but that's the only thing that takes away from the album. I prefer the ""Now"" series, but this is pretty close. I definately reccomend this to fans of recent music of the past few months. But WARNING: Don't buy it just for the Alicia Keyes song cuz odds are you're going to be disappointed."
2,The Hits CDs Aren't Worth It,The Totally Hits and Now Series really have nothing at all special. Each have maybe 3 songs that I really like but I already have them. Unless you slept for a year and wanna hear SOME (and only some) of the biggest hits of the year. Then I would suggest these series but you should just spend your money on a real artists whole cd! Probably the high points on this cd are Hit 'em Up Style and I Do!! but then things like LFO's Life Is Good show how low music gets and also Uncle Cracker is probably the worst song just about ever.
4,Totally blew Now 7 away!,"I know these songs won't appear in Now 8 (that is if they are going to continue). Not to say that the ""Now"" series are no good, but lately (and it started with Vol. 6) the selection of music hasn't been too wide. I mean, how many times has Britney Spears and N' Sync appeared in the Now series? They're good songs, but Now compilers have to make it into a creative pick. This album really outdone itself from the previous two albums. At first I thought these were low-grade knockoffs of NOW. Until the 2K1 version came out, it totally gotten better. I mean, the first half of the songs on its list are still in the Billboard top 40! Some of the songs are a bit old but the selection is way better than Now 7. NOW is starting to have a serious rivalry here. The best song compilation yet!"
5,Totally Hits 2001,"I remember seeing the ad for ""Totally Hits 2001"" on television.Its everything you would want in a CD. It has your rap,slow,more up-beat, and even some remixes. It has things the ""NOW"" series wont include; such as ""Get Ur Freak On"", Ect.Which makes ""Totally Hits 2001"" the #1 ""mix"" CD ever!!!"
3,"Lovely albums, remastering so-so","I love these two albums by Vic Damone but take issue with the remastering. Certainly some effort could have been make to take out the 2 seconds of distortion on the lovely track ""Why Can't I Walk Away?"" (warbles about 2 minutes into the track). Aside from that minor but crummy detraction, this is a great set."
5,Taffy,"I love that more than I love Taffy, and I'm a man who enjoys his Taffy- To quote a great show!"
1,Taffy's,"This was the worst item I ever saw. It was rubbish and I returned it and they did not give me my money back., The item was rubbish and the seller even worse. I will be careful next time I buy something online."
1,Is this really Taffy Town?,"There is something odd with the product description. The description says ""Taffy Town"" by it also says it is manufactured by ""Candy Crate Salt Water Taffy"" not ""Taffy Town."" Taffy Town makes very good stuff; the flavors taste natural and it is certainly not salty. I'm echoing the the previous review's one star because I'm assuming this product is actually not Taffy Town. Other vendors on amazon.com sell the Taffy Town product and it gets about four stars. Taffy Town is at least four stars in my book. Confusing."
5,lots of candy,"I was surprised how much taffy was in the package...it has raspberry, spearmint, peppermint, licorice, banana, ice cream, chocolate, orange...tasted like dreamsicle!, and a green flavor..the only one I didn't care for."
2,Not what I expected!!,I ordered saltwater taffy. I paid $15 now for the product. It arrive in a timely manner I will give them that. But when I opened up the package it was mixed with sugar free and regular taffy. I wanted all regular no sugar free! Also the candy was really hard and when you open them update cracked pieces still all over the place. that's really unacceptable and waste of my money. I would never buy from that company again.
1,Peter Green?????,"As being a fan through the years I was been expecting too much from this one.Pete hardly touches the strings.His sidekick Nigel does all the work.Even when he talks to the audience,he hardly finds the microphone.He sits like Sitting Bull.Avoid this dvd and buy John Mayall 70th birthday.He looks like a young God.Jacques"
2,An evening with nigel watson splinter group !,"if you like nigel watson ,this is for youbut if you like peter green ...."
3,Evaluation by a crime analyst,This book is a good resource for persons starting a crime analysis unit or for a person who is new to the crime analysis. Of particular value is the listing of resources and the discussion of operating philosophy. The book is well written and well laid out.
4,Beautiful pictures of Industrial Age castoffs,"Jet Lowe is a government photographer, who specializes in documenting machinery in old factories that are about to be torn down. He photographs with a large format view camera, and goes far beyond the requirements of simple documentation--his photos are monumental and imbued with the sadness of obsolescence."
1,Sad,"This is without a doubt the most biased and poorly written book I have seen in recent years. The author clearly has chosen the path of the unsilent minority. The author bashes Police and Police Agencencies. They are stereotyped in a fashion far more simple minded than the author accuses them of being themselves. Accusing law enforcement of wrong doing is what sells, whether or not what is said is true or not. The author chose to make a buck rahter than speak the truth. This book shows his ingnorance and unrealistic approach and report of America in this day and age. Rather then search for comprehensive solutions to the crime in this nation, the autor has chosen to jump onto the band wagon and mearly criticize. No talent, no realism, and no originality. A dollar is a dollar as is obvious with this book."
5,Politically and Intellectually Bracing,"This book deftly serves up a wealth of material to try to convince your liberal friends (I'm presuming 'you' are a radical) that the police really are a pillar of racism and capitalism, and not simply a bunch of oppressed workers who don't understand that the protesters they are hitting on the head are actually on their side. But even better, Williams account has real intellectual substance, both historical and sociological. As history, he grounds the evolution of the police in the evolution of American racism, dating back to the slave patrols. As sociology, he scoops the 'bringing the state back in' crowd, which, for all its talk about the importance of looking at institutions of the state, has missed the growing autonomy and political power of the police in the US. My only kvetch is that he fails to look more than superficially at the roots of public support for the police--but I suppose you can't do everything in one book."
5,A Favorite,"This album has been a favorite among my holiday collection, and indeed among all my Celtic albums, since picking it up in the bargain bin ten years ago. Very well done traditional Celtic carols, including a lovely alternate setting of Auld Lang Syne that I prefer to the original. It also highlights traditional instrumentation (no cheating with keyboards!), which is nice for the enthusiast. This is a fine album--its only flaw is an inaccurate track listing, but you'll be able to figure out which song is which before long."
5,"Wow, The Characters and Storyline Really Come to Life!","I thought the LAST GENTILE was a hard act to follow, but this book is even better! Masterful development of the character set and storyline make you feel like you're actually engaged in the battle against evil. I highly recommend this book and after the first books cliffhanger ending I was glad I could get my hands on the second and third books instead of having to wait."
4,Very exciting adaption of the end times,"Just like book one, this is an easy read that touches your heart and soul. Bringing ideas to the forefront other end time series have not, it encourages you to search for the truth and examine the evidence of our current times.If Christian fiction is what you seek, you will love this trilogy."
1,Is not a stand alone phone,I bought this corded phone and normally corded phones power on once you plug into the phone line but not this one.Found out you need a control system to operate this phone.Those cost around $400 or more.These are considered hybrid business phones so if you're looking for one to use at home keep this in mind.Had to send back for refund.
1,metro,The operating instructions are worthless. I want to have it beat three over two and still assume it can but have no clue as to how to make it work. A total waste of money.Ross
3,Metronome is too big and the speaker is very poor,"For some people, this is going to be the metronome of choice because it is the Swiss Army knife of metronomes. I'm guessing it does practically everything you want it to do. Unfortunately, there are two flaws with this unit: in the first place, it is very large, and will not fit in your pocket, and barely on a music stand, which makes it rather impractical to use, and also the built-in speaker is tinny sounding and really not ready for prime time considering the cost of this unit. I think the metronomes here are superior:Peterson BBS-1 BodyBeat Series Sync Metronome,Boss DB-30C Dr. Beat Metronome,Intelli IMT-1000 Digital Dual Metronome & Pitch Generator."
5,Dr. Beat Boss DB-90,Bought this Dr. Beat DB-90 for my daughter for a birthday present. According to her it is absolutely amazing. She is a music performance major at a local college and has been using this now for about a month and is totally enthralled with it. While I have no idea how to use it I hear it being used quite a bit as there are many different sounds and beats. The most annoying but apparently useful benefit of this item is that it is loud and/or has the ability to be really loud! Crucial when you are using it versus the less expensive brands. Accuracy and volume are apparently the main concern when you buy something like this. This is perfect according to our music major.
5,Very Happy with this Metronome,"My piano teacher owns this metronome, and everytime we use this in my lessons I was blown away by what it does. When I asked my teacher about it he told me there was a cheaper one that would probably suit my needs just fine. Well, I looked at all of them and just felt intuitively to buy this one regardless of price.Yes, there is one cheaper then this, but I am so glad I purchased this particular product. I love the way it looks, I love that it does all kinds of subdivisions and rhythms because being a pianist, there are so many ways to practice using a metronome and this one just simply rocks!!!! If I ever need to do really crazy mixed up beats this will do it. Period.I felt like I spluged a tiny bit because there is another one a bit cheaper, but you know, you ALWAYS get what you pay for and I am glad I went with this metronome! It really can do just about everything. Oh, and you will have to buy a cord if you don't want to use batteries."
4,Absolute necessity for the serious musician,"I'm a classical musician and aspiring conductor in college. A student especially can go through metronomes like coffee, and it's always a struggle to find the one that does the best and most for your money. This thing is like a metronome computer program in a box. Great product! The features are pretty full and complete! Works great, and it's LOUD which I love.One gripe? The colors haha"
3,Great metronome -- with a flaw in the case,"I think the DB-90 is a very good metronome and the additional features that it offers the user are well-worth the cost. On the other hand, the plastic fold-out stand (which is minimally) attached to the plastic case with two miniscule pegs is nowhere near that standard. The stand has popped off (become totally detached) on many occasions and, of course, the unit tumbles over; it has marred my piano and exhausted my patience. In every other way, this unit deserves five stars."
4,awesome introduction,"II normally just read Eloisa James, but this was a great way to see if I liked similar authors. The stories are also the perfect length for lunch breaks or waiting at the doctors' office or DMV."
5,Does Its Job!,"Works well, easy to tear, doesn't hurt skin but is sticky enough to stay when needed! I use it with my childcare kids (maybe twice a year) and wouldn't dream of using anything else!"
1,No good,This tape is too sticky. The dispenser is nice (but of course can't be refilled). The tape is overly stretchy and does NOT come off easily.
5,Re:he does it again,Mr. Keane has written another good book! u wont be able to put this one down. Well written. Congrats!
2,Weird sizes....,"I'm 5'10"" nd weigh in at about 280...so far i've tired the 2x, 3x (this one was at the seller's reccomendation) and the 4x and all were too small. They do not fit from crotch to shoulder and are too narrow for my frame. And since there is no sizing chart to go by its all guess work on size...the body is too small and the arms and legs are ridiculously huge...I may try the 5x to see if it fits any better or I may have to go with something else..although i have no idea what that would be as yet..its very frustrating."
2,Not for me,Even at the larges size it is too small in the sholders and crotch. And I wear 5xl in a sports shirt with comfort.
2,"Decent content, poor media or transfer","I found this to be an engaging video, solely for it's content and presentation. However, I have to knock off stars for the poor quality of the VHS transfer. The audio drops out, is noisy, and ""crackles"" in too many places. I've encountered this on two copies of my own (wore the first one out) and on a friends. So this seems to be a problem for this tape.However, it was so nice to see such great live footage of classic songs and bands in their heyday."
3,This album probably deserves a better rating.,"I bought this cd because I love the studio version of ""Only You Know And I Know"".There are other songs that I like but overall the live album is more desirable."
3,"Ballroom Dancing for Beginners, and Intermediate","Video tapes are good source for learning, especially if live instruction is not available.Ms Mason and her partner Randolph are excellent smooth dancers. The problem for those wishing to learn is that the man's steps are shown separately in detail, but not the woman's. Also the man is usually filmed from front or side and not from the back making it difficult to follow. We did learn to dance, and quite well, but only after numerous stops and rewinds. The Webb's tapes are a classier production and much easier to follow but their dancing is not as polished. Except perhaps in their swing series which appears to be more of Webb's style."
3,Useful for a beginner,"As a rank beginner in ballroom dancer, I found this DVD to be instructive and clear. The narration is concise and the demonstrations are well done. The instructional level is very basic, but that is ok for someone just starting. This DVD could serve as useful supplement to ""real"" dancing lessons, and it would make a good review reference for the sometime dancer."
3,Beginner,"The lesson on the tape is good for the beginners in ballroom dancing, especially for the ladies, since the man take a lead."
4,Question,"I brought this CD back in the 90's. I remember it being 2CD's. Now I could be wrong but, I don't think so anyway love the CD. If there is a Pulse with2 CD's I will be needing/wanting that also Thanks you!!!!"
4,Great CD,"I think the CD is great, considering that I love to dance (on the dance floor or alone in my room, sometimes with a friend). the only thing that irks me about this CD is that they didn't use to original version of Mr. Vain, which i thought was going to be my favorite song on that album, until i heard it. But, the other songs make up for it."
3,Club and Radio Hits from the early 90s,"Just a bit of warning for some dance newbies out there. There is nothing new about this CD. Just another collection of ""greatest"" hits and might as well be in the Wal-Mart shelves just behind the latest edition of the National Enquirer.The content? Well, club pop radio friendly tunes from the late eighties through the ninties. The disco of the era much maligned but heavily rotated through nearly every dj's set. There are very few djs who didn't play at least one of these tunes once. Of course they've all been relegated to local used record store and the records are there too!So, if you want a stroll down memory lane or couldn't quite remeber what the hell they played in the club that night while you were happy face plastered listen up.My grip is with the marketing. Trying to trick people into buying this CD. Why not just call is Pulse of the 90s? What's with the enigmatic cover?"
4,Get Up And Dance!!!.,"This CD is impossible not to groove to. ""Pulse"" features some of the biggest and best dance hits of the 90's. Snap's ""Rhythm Is A Dancer"" was a huge hit and is a great way to kick things off. Other big songs follow such as Robin S.'s ""Show Me Love"" and the fantastic pop/dance single ""Another Night"" from the Real McCoy. Ace of Base are here with ""Beautiful Life""...*although I would've rather seen ""The Sign"" on here* as is CeCe Peniston's club staple ""Finally."" However, the best track goes to La Bouche's fabulous ""Be My Lover"" which is one of the best dance songs ever. Other stand-outs include ""Rhythm of the Night"" by Corona and Le Click's ""Tonight Is the Night.""My one big complaint...where is C&C; Music Factory??? ""Gonna Make U Sweat"" was probably the biggest dance song of the early 90's and is sorely needed here. If it was on here, this album would pretty much be perfect."
3,The Best of 90's Dance Music,"This cd is chock full of all of the overplayed club hits of the 90's but I grew up with this stuff and it just has a nostalgia factor to it. My problem with the cd is the fact that it is very misleading in the versions of the songs it gives you. For example, Rhythm is a Dancer is NOT the version that was played on the radio and the cd does not tell you that anywhere on it. The same goes for Mr. Vain which is drastically different from the one that you might remember. Another thing that bugs me is how short some of the songs have been cut down to. I know that they have to shorten the tracks to fit them all in, but I would rather lose 1 or 2 of the songs and get the rest in their full form. The same thing was done on Madonna's Immaculate Collection. You're listening to a really good song, which you think is nowhere near being over, and then it just ends. Bummer.Overall it's pretty good though."
4,Great for Running!,"This album is the perfect pump up for EXERCISE! I trained for a marathon last summer to this CD and - YES, I made it all 26.2 miles thanks to the energy imparted by this cd! I am now ordering Fired Up! To prepare for my next marathon."
5,Great for the Beach,We use these to hold drinks at the beach and they are wonderful for keeping the sand from sticking to the outside of wet containers. They make great gifts!
3,Tovolo Wine Sticks -- Hmmmm,"I've spilled a fair amount of expensive wine on the grass in my time, so a use-it-anywhere-there's-a-soft-surface wine glass holder is an attractive concept. Unfortunately, they are also a bit tricky to use. The delicate twist/lift action that is necessary to get the wine glass out of the holder is distracting and inconvenient, detracting from the pleasure of the moment. Still, it's definitely superior to watching your wine trickle away in the grass because the glass decided to tip on the uneven surface, or having to maintain a constant hold on your glass while trying to eat your food."
5,Just like Crate & Barrel!,I bought a set of these from Crate & Barrel and I also bought this set from Amazon. I wanted to compare them - I had only heard of people using the C&B ones at music in the park. These are identical. The box is even the same (just with different coloring/branding). I'm excited for it to warm up so I can shove these in the ground and break out the Chardonnay!
3,Nice but too short.,"Perfect if you are sitting in the grass, just a few inches from the ground. I would prefer them to be taller, and align next to a beach chair, and not such a trip hazard."
5,Fascinating book,"What a great book! The subtitle says it all: ""a journey into a hidden world."" Davis not only explores the world of voudou, santeria and other incarnations of African religions that are hiding in plain sight from most white Americans-an utterly fascinating realm--but he also provides an engaging perspective on another complex culture: the American South. Aside from its obvious academic worth, the book is a totally entertaining travelogue from someone who really knows how to write."
1,What a disappointment.,"As a musician who has built his life around music of the African Diaspora, Davis' book is a great disappointment to me. Described as a search for vodou in America, the story unfolds as the diary of an inept hunter. The author for some reason chooses to lump all of Santeria, Candomble, Haitian religion, and any practice however remotely African in origin as ""Voudou."" This is as far as I know unprecedented.It is indeed painful to listen as he wanders from town to town asking strangers on the street in effect, ""Hey, where's the voudou?"" In short,any treatment of African religion that fails to address the triad of rhythm, dance, and song as the living, breathing liturgy of worship is like describing Christianity without the bible."
5,Works well,I used this roller to massage knots out of my calves and I thought it worked well. The rest of my family said it tickles too much.
5,Awesome!,Great tool to help sore muscles!!! Highly recommend this product to aid in your training routine and help relieve knots and tension.
3,Quality...,"I've used this thing several times and it works, but it's not a very smooth motion and it's not quite wide enough to get parts of my back. For the money I really think they could have come up with a smoother roller. Ahh well, maybe I just don't know much about mechanical engineering."
4,"Yeah, I take my stick and rub myself down! So what?!","One of the best self myofascial release tools available. The stick is pretty rigid(that's what she said). I use this stick on my back, arms, calves, thighs, and butt (that's what she said). My squats and deadlift are constantly increasing and I feel great. Get your stick, and get your release!"
5,A must for the active person,Very pleased with the results. Read all review of the stick and opted for the tiger tail. Glad I made the right choice. The foam roller makes the world of difference.
5,my husband loves it......,My husband loves this tool. He uses it before he works out or play basketball. He does cramp up or anything anymore.
5,Goodbye soreness,"Great tool for post workout tightness. The 22"" is too short to work on your back by yourself though. The tiger tail seems to be very well made and should last a long time. Instructions are helpful as well."
5,THIS IS A WINNER!,"It's been awhile since I've ordered a few books and rather than bore you with the same old rave reviews, I just have a few things to state. The book kept me up until my eyes could not take it anymore; The character Bishop in the book was fascinating. I won't go into details but the fact that it deals with FGM (Female Genital Mutilation) which is going on in certain tribes in Africa paints a picture for me to better understand the culture. Althought I don't agree with it. Pick the book up and you will not be dissappointed."
1,Waste of Time & Money,"272Pgs - This is my personal view of this book.It did not grab my attention at all. At the fourth chapter, I was looking for my receipt. More Women are becoming Soul Searchers today and if you are a Title Seeker like myself meaning (a title of a book can prompt you to purchase) this book will definitely be a lesson well deserved."
5,Why are there not more reviews written about this book..,"Tracy Price-Thompson has written YET another winner !!! The story is excellent and will have you turning the pages to see what is going to happen next. In fact I must issue a warning to be fair. If you have a busy day and want to get things done, this is not the book you want to start reading. I could not put it down. The reviews above give you the storyline and they are right on point. Now all YOU have to do is get this book and you'll be writing or telling someone they need to read this book as well. Keep these wonderful books coming Tracy..!!"
5,a woman's worth,"This book stayed in on my wish list for a very long time, and now I'm so upset with myself. This was my best read of 2011 and I've read over 100 books. It left me speechless, where the title threw me for a loop when I stated to read it i totally got it!!!!!!!!!! The book has me lost for words but one word that works is AWESOME!!!!!!!!"
5,A Powerful and Moving Novel,There is just one word that I can use to describe this novel - AMAZING! I could not put this book down; I read it within 24 hours of its arrival. This novel is a strong testament to the good brothas that ARE in the world.
5,Navajo Myths and Legends,Definately a good book and amazing resource. The author has traveled far and wide to obtain the stories written here.
4,A good companion in Dermatology OPD,This (lucture note series) book have important points to acquire in your Dermatology rotation. starting with history and physical examination then discussing diseases in an organized waywhich makes it interesting to read. Still not comprehensive and can not be used as a text book.
4,Chewable version no longer available,I've been using Fluidjoint for several years. Seems to work but unfortunately the company no longer makes it in chewable form. The caplets are huge and difficult to swallow.
4,Their last album,"This was originally released under the title *A VOLAR* in 1969, and it was the last LP the group recorded before its breakup in March 1970. There are some excellent tracks here, most notably Jerusalem De Oro & Se Acabo, where Estela Raval, the lead voice, shows off her great skills as an interpreter. The group's golden era was coming to a close, they felt they couldn't keep up with the prevailing music scene at the time, hard rock having taken over the record business. They reunited in 1982 with a few changes in personnel (Estela and a couple of the old members remained), and they are still active today, but that's another story. This is a very good album, a satisfying farewell from one of Latin music's most popular and enduring vocal groups of the 50s and 60s."
2,"Did this go straight to video? If not, it should have.","Ok, if you are a fan of eye candy (Taye Diggs, Brandon Routh), with very little character or dialogue, then this movie is for you! That is the only reason this gets two stars. Routh and Diggs are hot.I can't see paying movie theater money for this though. Brandon Routh didn't really seem to have a plot other than to ride around the city and graveyard looking for people to shoot at. On the other hand Taye Diggs was pretty hot in his wardrobe playing the part of a savvy nightclub owner."
2,Dylan Dog: Night of the BAD MOVIE,"Here is a film I'm surprised was not a SYFY Origional Presentation. It was boring, and kind of silly. I donno maybe addult men who somehow still collect comic books (a result of being too poor or dumb to as a kid?) Usually men who want to take advantage of others by overpricing them. This movie was like Coloumbo in his youth. I didn't find the charecter intersting enough to keep me clued to the tele... it was just cheaply done and so bad. You'd have to be a fan of the comic book immature crowd to dig this it offered no imagination, no real plot no anything. sorry, I was hoping to love it... but even the actors were a bit on the cheesy size. If you like this you will LOVE The Midnight Hour from the late 80's and even that was better than this one. Sorry."
1,Horrid,Until there is a time travel and you can go back and get the hour and 40 minutes of your life back avoid this at all costs
2,Not very good Dog night,"Like most horror fans I watch a lot of movies that are considered bad, as in ""this sucks"". I've found over the years that it's kinda 50-50 that I will like or dislike a film. This movie is pretty bad. Brandon Routh seemed kinda bored and seemed to have only one expression, well, kinda bored. I gave the movie two stars because 1. Anita Brien is hot and, 2. Sam Huntington was kinda funny, sometimes. Taye Diggs character seemed to be a cross between Eddie Murphy's vampire and Superfly. Was the gold canine really necessary? I don't think this was the actors fault, really. The director will have to be held responsible. If you want to view film, rent it first and you will get what I mean. You will know you just wasted your money."
3,Not bad not good,"This film could have been a lot better but there was too much joking in the film. It would have been pretty good if it would have been more dramatic or serious, because the comedy in it hurt it bad."
5,Excellent DVD for little ones,"My little 4 year old grand-daughter got all dressed up with her leotard, tights & tap shoes to follow along with this class. She was adorable. We will be signing her up for real classes, but in the meantime, she was following the excellent instruction by the instructor. She was adorable and loving it. The ballet class is also very enjoyable and excellent! However, I would comment that the Jazz class is a bit too advance for a 4 year old at this point. But it will be great for use when she is a little bit older."
4,Where are the boys?,"I bought this for my son, who is taking ballet and tap--he enjoyed watching it and I think it will get more use later when he has learned more--but he kept trying to find other boys in the video, and there aren't any--why not? Even boys take dance classes! Plus, the sound quality could be better--it seemed to fade in and out a bit. The overall instructrion for the kids in the video and the ability to use it to reveiew and learn new things seem good, however."
2,daning for kids,it is ok product but my daughter found it a little boring it need a little more action for her
4,Dancing for Kids DVD,"My granddaughter is very interested in dancing/princesses and she associates ballerinas with this. She is a little young for formal dance lessons, but she really is enjoying this DVD. Also, it is great in showing her the correct poses with their proper names. Working out just great."
3,Just ok,I was excited to get this video for my four year old daughter since she loves the Bella Dancerella videos but this was a disappointment. She has only watched it once since we got it for Christmas. The teacher is dry and not very enthusiastic. My daughter also had some difficulty following the moves in the video.
2,boring,"My 4 yr old is in dancing. I bought this tape hoping to help her, plus give her some exercise when it's too hot outside to do anything. But, it sucks. It's cheaply made and is so boring my daughter will not do it."
1,Very Dated!,I bought this with the intention of getting some ideas for the children I teach. I was VERY un satistfied. BORING and looks like it is from the 80s.
2,Nothing great about these shetets,"Does not feel like a high thread count sheet at all. Very ordinary, feels like a polyester blend material. When I received the package, it was missing the pillow covers, So I am in the process of returning it and replacing it with something that matches quality with price."
5,Hymns through the Centuries,"This is not a review. I just have a question. Does ""Hymns through the Centuries"" contain the hymn ""It is Well with my Soul?"" Thanks."
2,There Are Better Options,"While the singing sounds good (hence the second star), the organist has a tendency to try to steal the show. A note in the booklet indicates that the organist occasionally improvises, and you can hear it: on tunes such as ""Abide With Me"" the familiar chords are replaced with a runaway organ. I would recommend either ""Be Still My Soul: The Ultimate Hymns Collection"" or ""Abide With Me: 50 Favorite Hymns"", both from DECCA Records, over this CD. ""Abide With Me: 50 Favorite Hymns"" has many of the same hymns sung by top-notch English choirs."
4,works for me.,did the job intended. Sturdy What else can be said about this product. Don't know why they ask for a review but must do so in a certain number of words.
2,Check the size!,That was my mistake. Hoping they would work for my bundt cakes but they were much smaller! :(. I'm not sure what size cake these would be good for... Certainly not regular sized ones.
1,I cant not believe this...,"I was so excited about this dvd when I first saw it. I thought it was a new dvd and hopefully better then Hipper than hip, it was a just a bit messy but still a good workout. Well it was worse, it was the same excat dvd except repackaged. Do not buy if you have already had hipper than hip or currently have it!"
1,double duty,This is Rania's Hipper Than Hip DVD with a new name there is not one iota of new material down to the 2 performances at the end. I have other DVD's of Rania's this is now the second time I have been disappointed. It should have been stated this is the same DVD with a new name. I have the Hipper Than Hip DVD and did not need another copy.
2,Repackaged goods,"I like this workout and the Rania workout series but I felt deceived in this purchase. I thought it was something new but it is the same thing as as another workout in her series called ""Hipper than Hip"""
1,disappointing music,"I searched everywhere for Barbershop Quartets singing Christmas songs and this was all I could find. This group really disappoints me. First, they are off key, frequently going flat. We have a lot of musicians in the house and all were wincing. Second, they tried to sing choir style so in most of the pieces they do not sound like a Barbershop Quartet, in other words they didn't start with an introductory ballad like so many Barbershop pieces will do, and they didn't do the classic harmonies. The ones where they tried to it right still suffered on pitch. Last, the recording room wasn't baffled properly and there's sort of an echo or vibrance behind their singing that is distracting. The seller did a fantastic job of getting this to me and the CD was in excellent condition at a fair price. My gift to all of you is to throw the CD in the waste bucket. I would not give it away or resell it."
5,"A Good general tunng book, too","In addition to STATSPACK, this book has great info on general Oracle tuning."
2,Not what I expected,"I was expecting this book to describe and help me decipher the statspack information to help me tune the database. Author focuses more on customizing statspack and running scripts against the statspack tables. Anyways, not what I needed. I'd like to know how to decipher Oracle's cryptic information."
1,Basic Information,Doesn't have details on interpreting STATSPACK reports. The other inforamtion in the book can be gleaned from various websites. Thoroughly disappointed. Waste of Money
5,An Excellent Manual for Statspack,"Statspack is one of the best Oracle provided tuning utilities to be released. However, Statspack is a complex program to install, run and most importantly, understand the output from. In this book Don leads the reader through the installation, setup and use of the Statspack packages. In addition Don shares numerous scripts and techniques for expanding Statspack to allow the user to monitor system and disk related statsitics as well as database internal statistics.Over all an excellent book for both the beginner and advanced DBA who wants to get up to speed on the Oracle Statspack package in the shortest possible time."
1,Pretty Basic,"This was a pretty basic book, with no real insights into how to performance tune databases. The techniques provided may work, but not in the majority of cases."
5,A Standout Golf Book!,"Paging through this book it doesn't take long to recognize that Golf Training is no ordinary golf book. Instead of the usual stroke savers and swing tips common to the mass of generic golf books out there, Golf Training digs deeper into the fundamentals of mental training, fitness training, developing a good swing, and the keys to effective practice. This latter subject of ""how to practice most effectively"" is powerful, practical, and backed by what seems to be sound sports science. The author has done her research, and it shows in this clear, authoritative text. Though written by an LPGA pro, I found Golf Training to be a standout book that should help any golfer--male, female, high/low handicap--to play better. This is a glossy book, with many great action and instructional photos that support the text. A classy book and a great read!"
2,slow slow slow,"Just a word of warning of this movie. I bought it on video a while back and much to my dismay realised that it is for lack of a better term ""still frame"" anime. Meaning lots of camera movement, and exposition on a still frame as opposed to current anime (a la Ninja Scroll... a movie any anime fan should see) which is constantly moving. Plot-wise pretty good, but visually fairly slow."
5,Every element of a good movie,"I thought that this was an excellent movie. It had it all:action, drama, violence, weapons, and (erm) nudity. All with a vague supernatural appeal. I watched this movie three times the day I got it, and watch it whenever I'm in the mood for a good Anime with a deep plot. I've recommended this to all my family and friends who like anime. For those of you who have never watched an anime, give this one a shot. It faithfully represents all of the ingredients that are needed for a movie."
2,A rip-off of ninja scroll,"When I bought this movie I was expecting to see an anime of quality comparable to Ninja Scroll (the best anime ever!). When I watched through the movie I was very disgusted I had bought it. It had many pointless scenes and most of the characters you never see again after one scene. As for the combat (the box says ""best ninja fighting action since ninja scroll"") it was mainly just still frame paintings with a moving camera. There is so much blood and gore that I actually felt sick, something that has never happened to me from a movie. One last thing, for 30 bucks I expected more than 47 minutes!"
1,Poor animation and pointless story,"I was very excited after purchasing this, seeing the line ""best sword fighting anime since Ninja Scroll"", but it wasn't even in the same league as Ninja Scroll. All the movie had was a bunch of old-style still frame animation with a story that went absolutely nowhere. Also the ending made no sense at all, I was expecting it to go on for about 20 more minutes. The only hightlight I can point out of this movie is that it was very violent. I'm a huge fan of samuri/ninja anime, yet I was extremely disappointed with this movie. I only wish I could get my money back. You would be better off spending your money on something else."
2,Uhh...Was it just me or did nothing happen in this movie?,"My first thought when the end credits started to role was: What the h--- was that? I wish I had read the reviews of this movie before I purchased it so I could have saved my [money] and bought a movie with a story. Granted this has everything every hard core anime fan wants; decapitations, dismembering and gratuitious sex, but there was just no point to the movie. Just as an interesting story starts to form, the movie's over. You never know anything about the main character except that he did something horrible in his past.... Then there's the ridiculously pointless assassin who shows up in the middle of the film.... Nothing explained, nothing concluded. Add the confounding pointlessness of this movie to the fact that it's not even 50 minutes long, and all you get is a big waste of money and bigger dissapointment. Two stars for creative deaths, zero stars for story and point. Bottom line: Don't bother...."
3,Decent stroy..............need more.,"I am not really big on anime, let me say first of all. But watching this at a friend's I really did get into the story of it, and though it did leave a lot of unanswered questions, I was told it was a first in a series, but that the series was never finished, at least not that we see on US storeshelves.The animation and art work is excellent."
3,"Valuable, but not perfect","This is a good resource - the author has done a great job in compiling a list of Biblical names with meanings, nicknames, and background. What she has not done, though, is give parents-to-be an idea of WHY they might want to choose a particular name - is it popular, obscure, considered old-fashioned? Nor has she shown the best judgment in her selection, since some names have only a negative Biblical connotation. Should expectant parents really consider ""Ichabod"" (the glory is departed), or ""Amnon"" (the son of David who raped his own sister)? I can't help but think of the scene in ""Moby Dick"" when Ishmael is rebuked for pointing out that Captain Ahab was named for a wicked, idolatrous king: ""Captain Ahab did not name himself. 'Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother."" This book does exclude ""Ahab"", by the way. So, expectant parents, read and use this book, but be careful that the stately Biblical name you choose is really what you want."
3,I was hoping for more names,"I bought this book based on a few reviews, but found the list of names to be too short. My own name was not even in the book, and it is a Biblical name (not one of the super- weird ones either). I did like the extra information that the author gave."
4,A nice helpful guide!,"We found this book useful since we liked the format - which gives 1) the name 2) Language/cultural origin, 3) Meaning, 4) Spiritual Connotation 5) related names 6) alternate names and 6) background story for the name as well as 7) Famous namesakes...the only downside was that compared to the other baby books we looked at it seemed very limited in terms of options which makes sense due to the fact that it focuses on religious/biblical names so yes we liked it but if you aren't focused on a Classical (biblical) name then this is not the book you want...we did choose a few names out of this so for us it worked well."
1,"Poor Quality, Shoddy, Obviously NOT Authentic","If these are real Pierre Cardin suitcases, then things have seriously gone downhill for the company, so much so they had to cut costs by having monkeys make their bags (or some other equivalently trained mammal).Seriously, even though the price was low I feel like I was ripped off. Uneven seams, threads sticking out, obvious sewing mistakes, just shoddy all around. I would have asked for my money back, but I got them 3 days before I had to leave to Europe and I needed to use them.Definitely do NOT recommend this seller. Perhaps the ORIGINAL Pierre Cardin suitcases really are nice, but these are NOT them! Wish I could tag this seller."
3,Not Sturdy,"The reviews for this luggage set were way better than it deserved. They're not terrible, but the material is thin and the zippers aren't very strong. Ove zipper broke and there's overall a high level of wear for the amount I've used them. I'd advise to invest a bit more money for luggage that will last a lifetime and youcan feel confident won't fall apart on a trip."
5,highland Christmas,My son bought this for my daughter who has been to Scotland. She has really enjoyed the music on it.
3,Pipers ?,This is a much better CD than I thought it was going to be. Nicely played through out the entire disc. My only complaint would be that it is titled Highland Pipers which lead me to believe there would be multiple bagpipers rather than just Iain Mac Harg. He does play the instrument quite well though. Great price too.
1,Smoke & Mirror aptly describes this farcical propaganda,"As a children's advocate I am appalled at yet another blatant attempt to prove that all mothers and children who disclose abuse are liars. Even Dr. Richard Gardner says that most likely 95% of child sexual abuse disclosures are valid, it's just societal shame based stigmas that make incest so damaging. There's got to be a better way than the FMSF's & Campbell's attitude that giving a child back to the accused somehow protects everybody. I'm not saying that pedophiles should be burned at the stake as object of ""Witchhunts"" that would be double jeopardy, since most child molesters were prior victims, but to say this problem is a figment of hysterical women and children with over active imaginations is ludicrous beyond belief! Victoria Pierce National Alliance for Family Court Justice"
4,excellent guide for mentors,"Some excellent explanations of the juvenile legal process for people who volunteer with kids in trouble or others not aware of the complexities of the system. Part I, dealing with the criminal sytem, is especially strong, and the life stories are really good for youth to relate to. I bought this book on the advice of my volunteer coordinator at a youth services program; I would encourage other volunteers or mentors for kids to check it out."
3,Good and bad,"Let's start with the positive. The subject in an interesting one, the author has clearly done much research, and the material is available nowhere else. The color plates are attractive and informative. The war stories, particularly of the Wurtsmith missions and the Secret Squirrel mission, are outstanding. The authors has information about individual airplanes which is a very ambitious thing to do.Now for the bad. The designation of the Strategic Radar is the AN/APQ-166, not AN/APQ-156. That radar replaced the OY-73/ASQ-176, not the ASQ-176. The HSAB can carry six Mk 84 bombs, not five. Various acronyms (ELE, KBX, etc.) are not spelled out the first time they are used. There are some annoying typographical errors also. These are not huge things but I have gotten accustomed to higher quality from this author and this publisher."
2,nice shape that's it...,"They look pretty good, but they are too thick to be elegant. If you fear breakage maybe these are the glasses for you. Funny thing is the package came with one glass broken, so I returned them because I didn't like them enough to keep them. One can't ask for much at this price."
4,Price Difference,"I really like the glasses. The problem is I paid $71.54 for eight glasses on 6/20/2011 and now, 7/5/2011, I happen to see that the same glasses are selling for $43.90. That is a pretty big price difference. I am not sure what Amazon's policy is on this?? I think there should be some type of credit for a price difference this large."
4,Excellent for red wine,I received the product in a timely manner and all four glasses arrived unbroken. The glasses have a nice weight to them and the design of the glsss enhance the flavor of wine. Looking to add 4 more.
2,Glass Shipped extremly carelessly,"I ordered these wine glasses as a Christmas gift, I even selected that option when shipping. The wine glasses were shipped in a large box without any padding. When I opened the shipping box the box that contained the wine glasses was ripped and torn. Certainly not appropriate for a Christmas Gift. Do not buy from this seller as they certainly do not take care when shipping your items."
5,"An Excellent $5 Glass, But Huge","These are great glasses [in more ways than one] but I must say I'd not have bought them if I fully realized just how large they really are - at its widest point it measures a full 4"" in diameter and stands nearly 10"" tall.They sure make an impression but rather too much of one at a dinner table for 6. Perhaps if I were serving $50 Reds or were setting a table for 12 or more but, as it is, my glass will make more of an impression than what's in it.Maybe I should consider them understated Brandy Snifters."
5,lovely,This is a larger wine glass with a nice shape any great price tag. Exactly what I was looking for and was delivered quickly and unbroken. Another amazon sucess for me!
5,Love them!!,"I love these glasses. They are the perfect size and shape for reds. Yes, they are big. But not so big that they look pretentious. Excellent value."
5,A brilliant retrospective,"Here we have a mezzo who was equally brilliant in the florid and dramatic style and who also sang Kunstlieder. Her recordings of Sacred Works might not be as famous as Ferrier's or Baker's but that doesn't mean she isn't as amazing. Her Eboli, Carmen, Charlotte, Rosina and many others are gems among the more famous recordings of her rivals. Her Charlotte is more stylistic and French than Obraszowa's, her Carmen has more esprit than Larmore's and so forth. Her interpretations of ""Die Post"" and other Lieder are little gems. Buy this album and discover a brilliant mezzo who is sadly underrated nowadays."
4,Thorough overview of Anglican Evangelicalism.,"This is a good book, but the title is somewhat misleading. One thinks the book is going to be about Stott, Packer & McGrath, whereas it is a history of the Evangelical wing of Anglicanism from the pre-Reformation period to the present. Covers a lot of ground some of which is repetitive, but provides a solid overview of the topic. The section on Lambeth & sexuality questions is especially good."
5,Another winner in the MacBeth series!,"Our favorite highland detective does it again! M.C. Beaton returns us to Lochdubh, Cnothan, and Drim to help Hamish solve another case. I read this book in one sitting--now what to do all summer? This book is consistent with the rest of the MacBeth series, the settings and characters are old friends. I find that I personally care less about the resolution of the murder than I do about the wonderfully quirky characters and their daily lives."
2,I like Hamish Macbeth but the story is dull & predictable,"I hope the mysterious MC Beaton reads these reviews. Her readers love Macbeth and the Scottish village life--the character is lovable. The stories badly need work on the story line. They read like they were written to a formula and were hurridly assembled--there is just not enough detail, and they are predictable. I think the mysterious MC Beaton has signed a contract for too many books under all those pseudonyms she uses. I know she is getting up in years and should be thinking about the legacy of well-crafted books that could be left behind instead of this pile of trash."
3,A MIXED BAG,"In this book, M.C. Beaton manages to inject new life into the series, though some of the language and images may surprise (even shock) her old readers. In spite of some updating, the novel still has a dated feel, but Ms. Beaton conveys life in the Highland villages with seeming authenticity and wit. I enjoyed the subplot regarding the minister's wife, Eileen. A flaw in the main storyline occurs when Hamish omits to review some evidence he collected early on, which would have led (possibly inconveniently) to a prompter solution of the mystery. Agatha Christie this is not. However, I would still recommend DEATH OF A SCRIPTWRITER for an entertaining read, as long as you don't expect a sophisticated mystery or lyrical prose."
3,Not a slip-on after all,"These sneakers are like a diving suit for your feet. Therefore they are very difficult for me to put on - there is a buckle in the back that must be loosened, and it is difficult to get the strap in the loop and tighten it again. Even with it loosened it is difficult to get my foot all the way in. Maybe a drop of dishsoap would help?Once on, they fit perfectly and are reasonably comfortable. I only wear them when I plan to walk in water. No socks required."
4,Excellent boxing sim,"Knockout Kings 2000 is an excellent boxing game. The list of fighters is outstanding, as well as the Career Mode, and the Great Fights mode. The game has excellent replay value. The fluid motion and the excellent control of the fighters lets you jump right in. Had a few problems though. Where is George Foreman? Foreman and Ali had some great fights. Or Prince Hamed. And knocking someone out 9 times out of ten isnt that hard. I know its the name of the game, but it could be a better game if you occasionally had to go the distance with someone. Overall a great game!"
2,It's just another Slugfest,"EA Sports have done a brilliant job on the graphics but where did the game play go? I mean after watching a brilliant intro playing the game isn't much fun at all. The sound tracks are brilliant but what happened to strategy and being able to make your opponent work. This game reminds me of Barry Mcguian's Boxing that came out for the commodore 64 back in the early 80's. There's absolutely no difference in game play. This game is just about pressing the button quicker that your opponent (that's if your in two player mode). This has taken a step backwards since Knockout Kings '99, which other than the graphics is a far better game.My advice: Don't buy!"
5,Great Boxing Game,"This is probably the best boxing game to date that I've played. The controls took me a few days to get used to, but the interactive training in career mode really helped me along. You really have to think differently against each opponent, capitolize on their weakness, and constantly change your attack."
3,Exciting At First.,"A fine game for starters in this limited game field,but doesnt grow in time.A wide range of boxers throughout it's history could be chosen(with the omission of Mike Tyson & George Foreman)& is quite good with the array of punches one could throw,though fairly limited in scope.The commentary is fine,but could have been better if worked on.A career mode is an added plus,though like the game grows tiring after a while,especially with a player having to labor over the created boxer's fighting skills.Classic bouts are featured with one being able to choose which boxer to fight in.Overall a fine game that hopefully will be bettered in Play Station 2."
3,I'd give it a 3 and a 1/2.,"It's kewl when you first get it but the career mode is way to easy until after the champ! Not a single soul, not even the champ, went more than 1 round against my boxer! Either My stratogy ROCKED or the game was to easy. My strat was:1st KnockDown: Go to the body until they block down there then go up top till they fall2nd KD: Make something up. If they block everywhere Hit em with the ""Rib Buster""3nd KD: Low blow (MWA HA HA HA!!!) then Finish em!Mmkay I'm done yakkin' now"
4,continuous KO,"The game is very good, but there is one complaint i have about it. That is, when you knockdown the opponent, he always gets up after 6 seconds the first time, 9 seconds after the second time, and finally is done after the third KO. I would like some more variety, but it is still a good game."
4,best boxing game yet,I thouroughly enjoyed this game. the career mode is awesome. you can create a very unique person. my one gripe is on platstation there are no modes for the level of play like most games. but it is worth the $
4,"Fun @ First, Gets Boring, I reccomend Ready 2 Rumble Boxing","Fun @ First, Gets Boring, I reccomend Ready 2 Rumble Boxing. KO Kings 2000 has great graphics, two player is fun, but one player gets boring. Ready 2 Rumble is A LOT better in fun & graphics are just as good. Characters in R2R are creative unlike these that are in this game, which are real. Worth the money, R2R comes first in my opinion though."
2,Basic electronic loops. Period.,"Ossia is a primer in basic electronic looping. Set up a pattern. Play something atop it. Add something else. Repeat ad nauseam. The sound textures aren't even interesting, sounding like something from a Pong game. Could be a soundtrack for Version one of Super Mario Brothers. Maybe. Ossia is a primer in basic electronic looping . . ."
4,You'll Shift Into High Gear With This Game,"Nascar 2000 is one of the most realistic racing games I have ever played. EA Sports has put out another winner.The graphics are superb and very realistic. The motion is so smooth, it's easy to sometimes forget that this is only a game. The sound could be done a little better, but the game more than makes up for it with the new fantasy courses, and allowing you to race against the king, Richard Petty.Another nice feature is the ability to customize a car to your liking. Nascar 2000 allows you to pick from a myriad of options to satisfy your own particular cravings. Overall, this game is quite entertaining and a surefire hit for racing fans."
4,Keeps getting better.....,"This is the best pure racing game I have played. This game offers everything you could ask for in deciding how your car will run and handle, right down to the air pressure in your tires. The only thing left is for them to increase the field so that you are racing against 40 drivers vs. 16. Thanks EAP Sports -- keep up the good work."
4,A good ride,"This game is a very smooth ride. I loved it. I couldn't put it down once it came in the mail. Still, I was somewhat disappointed with how easy it was to win the championship. All it seems to take is a course with enough nintey degree turns. You can always make those turns faster than the rest of the cars for some reason, no matter who you play with. So, the game is fun and runs smoothly, but pretty much anyone with a steady hand will defeat the first try."
4,"I mean its fun, but you need more cars for each race","Both the first game and this one are pretty fun, but you need more than 16 cars to be a real race. Also, when are they going to make a NASCAR game that has some real crashes. I know its just a game but I think that some more smoke and visual damage to cars would be cool. I mean you can bump cars all the time in this game and nothing ever happens. It was still fun, but it could be better"
4,Reunion,First off I thought It would be alot better done than it was. But I am a die hard Dark shadows fan. I found the interviews on the Mike Douglas show with Jonathon Frid and Joan Bennett very cool (their is a very annoying woman with Joan however). They do a very nice little talk with the audience however the audience asked some really stupid questions. Lara Parker still looks gorgeous after all these years. I really wished Jonathan would have been apart of it. Dan Curtis is a complete hoot. The way he threw things together and they worked the man is a genious!!!! The fruit cake that hosted this reunion should be shot
5,A terrific & moving book.,"Not only is this book full of vital information & guidlines, it emphatically displays this author's true love & respect for cats. It's full of beautiful & touching pictures of cats. It is also very orgzanized in its format. I liked this author so much that I am ordering another one of her books. This is the best book I have read on cats, yet."
3,It's OK if you are not looking for specifics...,"This is a good DVD that will provide an overview on how to field dress big game. I bought primarily hoping that I could learn how to properly remove the bladder and associated ""parts"" but this video never even touched on that subject."
5,The definition of incredible sound,"I couldn't have purchased a better stereo, this is truly a great little ipod dock, with tremendous sound and clear highs and lows. Love it so much, it's truly great! Easy to use remote, simple and stylish, perfect for large or small rooms, because it will fill both with its sound!Absolutely wonderful!"
4,"Beautiful Unit, Great Sound","After reading reviews of various speaker systems for my first ever iPod, I settled on the Griffin Amplifi. It's a beautiful, almost retro looking unit, extremely easy to use, rich sound that seems to do a nice job of filling a fairly large living room. I can't speak to its reliabilty yet, as I've only had it for a few days, but so far, so good.I'd have given it five stars if it had some kind of treble/bass control, and if the remote somehow allowed for a bit more control over the iPod itself, i.e. changing artists, albums, etc. But, for the price, it's a wonderful addition to my ever-growing list of accessories!"
2,lack of low volume control a huge issue for some,"Turning the volume dial from mute up one click switches the volume to about 1/3 volume, which is a huge issue for anyone who needs to play music at a low volume - babies room, falling to sleep to music, etc.No, you can't adjust the volume via the iPod.The only work-around might be to plug the iPod in via the line-in input (I never said this is a good work-around)."
3,"Looks and sounds great, but can't turn it *down* enough.","I agree with the general consensus on the sound quality -- I find it to be fantastic, especially at this price point. But the volume control is criminally bad. The lowest volume setting is far, far too loud for use in a quiet environment (late at night when other family members have gone to bed, for example). Rather than tapering down gradually to quiet, it just goes from moderately loud to mute. More likely than not will be a return -- a pity, as I really like the unit otherwise."
1,Fails at low volume,"I bought this device for my office, where I listen to music at a fairly low volume. Turning the volume smoothly down from a middle level, it all of a sudden mutes completely. There is no low- or low-middle setting for volume. This happens both with the volume knob on the front of the device and when using the remote."
3,A bit disappointed,I purchased this system after buying a new 16GB Ipod Nano. I wanted a system that I could use as my main music listening at home. I liked that it wasn't a portable unit and that it didn't incorporate an alarm clock and other features. I knew at this price point that the sound would not blow me away but after reading the reviews I felt confident that I would be satisfied that I received a solid product with solid sound for the price. After listening it it for several days and trying to rationalize with myself that it was fine I had to admit that this isn't the sound system for me. At low levels I heard crackling static noise and even at higher volumes the sound didn't come close to feeling like it filled out a small room. This might work for a small bedroom for a child or maybe even a small home office but it doesn't work for a total listening experience.
2,JBL radial systems are better,"As a non technically savvy listener, I was disappointed with the sound quality. I should have bought the JBL radial speakers, which are superior."
4,Love it for the Price,this retro looking sound system is excellent for the money. Great sound clearity. Dial is very cool. Would highly reccomend.
2,well well,...it's cheap and thats what it is....no bass...sounds like a pocket radio from the sixties...no power....plain and simple NOTHING...HERE IS THE GOOD PART...MAYBE IT'S ME THAT IS SPOILED WITH SOUND EQUIPMENT
4,You'll be happy you did.,"I compared the prices and features of a few different brands and have no regrets about going with the Griffin. The sound isn't quite as rich as the Bose SoundDock, but it's closer than you think. The look is more my style though and it is built well. That's brushed aluminum on the sides (not white) with black wood on the rest. The remote allows you to power on and off, control volume, and skip forward or back. Wish there was a remote that allowed you more control, but I can get up from the couch now because I've been working out. The biggest gripe I have (which is echoed here) is the inability to charge your ipod/iphone when this unit is not on. It works with the iphone, but you have to go to airplane mode (another gripe). All in all, for the price this is one hell of a speaker!"
5,This is Great Music!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this CD all the way through. I had never heard of Tina Arena until I saw that someone I'm a fan of had attended a party celebrating the release of her newest album - so I had to investigate. After reading everyone's reviews of how much they like her, I figured I'd take a chance. Everyone was right! This lady has some great songs on her CD - I can't wait to acquire a few more because I'm sure I won't be disappointed! I'd say if you were looking for someone new to listen to, you couldn't go wrong trying out Tina!"
1,Tina Arena SUCKS!,"Overrated singer with a very plain voice. Responsible for bad reviews on Notre Dame de Paris. Bad as a singer, but worse as an actress."
1,Horrible!,This album features one of the worst performers around. Get another album. ANY other album!
5,Beautiful soundtrack!,"When I first looked for this soundtrack, I didn't realize that it was no longer being made. Plus, I was wanting just one song, ""Table for Two."" But after purchasing it, I have enjoyed listening to this entire soundtrack! It is romantic and whistful."
5,Relive The Magic of Disney!,"Someone should find Alan Silvestri and give that man an Oscar or something! I mean, WOW. He first caught my attention with his achingly beautiful work on Contact (talk about a great score), and now to have his awesome talent invested in The Parent Trap (1998; Lindsay Lohan, Dennis Quaid, Natasha Richardson) ... what a blessing. Listen to, oh say, track 7 (when Hallie as Annie first sees her grandfather and mother; ""Hallie Meets Mom""), and close your eyes whilst doing so. If you have any sort of an imagination (mandatory for watching any Disney movie--I pity people w/o soaring imaginations), let go while you listen to the fun, heartwarming, pixie dust sprinkled melodies, and relive those magical moments of reunion(s). The best background (or center stage!) music, anytime, anywhere. You go, Silvestri!"
3,It is NOT gold,"I was very disappointed by the actual color of the sheets. It's a brownish, khaki-ish color. It definitely looks nothing like the displayed the picture. As for the finish of the fabric, it's smooth to the touch, but not soft. Maybe with a few more washes, it will soften up."
5,Best Anime You'll Never See,Incredible voice acting and dialogue make this a must-have for dub-lovers. From the minds of the artists who gave us the Shinesman dub.
3,"Very informative, but very dry reading.",I got this book for my Arts of Asia class and it is highly informative but it is rather dense. I think that it is safe to assume that Mr. Lee did not write this with novices to Asian Art in Mind. His writing style is not very engaging and it can be hard to stay focused on the text.
1,Zzz.,"Biggest snooze fest, ever. I literally fall asleep when trying to read it. :( It's not very useful for students in that it completely lacks concise and emphasized relevant information. There isn't even a glossary in the back! UGH. Bullet points and summaries, please!"
4,Review...,"It was in great condition when I received it. I have not read it yet, since it is for a college course, and it won't start until the 25th of August. I'm sure it is like any other textbook."
1,Awful attempt at renacting a decent tv series,"Why did they bother with this? She's got many fans, a hit series, why not make loads of money by releasing a substandard game? That is the view that the company behind this must have undertaken.Firstly the graphics are terrible! Cut scenes are awful and the in-game graphics are just diabolical! next the gamplay, terrible! A really bad attempt of turning Xena into a tomb raider clone, levels that are bugged fights that are uninvolving and just a whole game engine that doesn't work!On the plus side the chacram is cool in this! If you throw the chacram you go into a pov situated behind and control it! meaning that you can hit out of the way switches, close drawbridges and kill enemies with the cleanest of ease.However despite this it doesn't stop the game from being terrible! Please just avoid this and get something like Resident evil 3 or syphon filter 2. They are far more enjoyable than this pile of dung!"
5,XANNAS NUMBER ONE FOR THIS (50)YEAR OLD GAMMER1,"Ive been playing xanna now for about(2) months and I Injoy it very much! and the t.v. shows great.Im at the last level,I think?where your in the pillered bldg,(at the big bull)how many pillers do you knock down?Im stomped! I love action games like xanna the graphics are very good too!when I get excited,I pause for about five minits,then I feel refreshed enough to go on. I think that in the practice area you learn a lot on game play Id be lost without that area. Im glad someone came up with this game."
3,Pretty Good,"I've had this game since it first came out. I've probably played it 20 times, it can be difficult in sections. One thing I was dissapointed in was the camera angles, they don't follow smoothly. Which can make the game difficult at times. All in all a pretty good game which could use improvement in areas of storyline, and camera angles. I wish this was more like a RPG, now that would be cool."
4,its good,im going to rebuy it when i have the chance i didnt beat it yet good action... u get to use a good different amount of weapons i remember .. the cutscenes are pretty good .. and u can actually play two player on it when u get to the board with gabriella and she is helping u fight just plug in another controller and ur friend can play with u during the part u are fighting the minostuars only though
2,Smythe Sewn Old LEATHER Wraps,"i was under the impression that this would be leather, or at least pleather, but it is not. it has a cardboard and paper cover. i was very disappointed."
4,"Loved the book, thought the description of the cover was off","I bought 3 of these for the women in my family to write down their memories. They all absolutely loved the idea and the book, especially the pocket in the back. I was a little disappointed in the cover. It actually looks to me like the paper for scrapbooking. I thought it would be more realistic. Everyone was happy though and for the price you can't beat it."
5,Perfect for a Memorable Event,"I found this journal in a local bookstore. I was looking for something unique to use as a memory/guest book at my late husband's memorial service. It served that purpose beautifully. No, it isn't leather but it has an aged, worn look while being sturdy and servicable. It will be a family keepsake. It reminds me of an old ship's log. I would definitely recommend it."
2,Smythe Old Leather?,"Wish I had checked the other reviews before I ordered. This ain't leather.I don't think it's Smythe either, since this product is made in China.Quality seems good enough, so I'll keep it, but next time I will be more thorough in research before ordering."
1,NOT as advertised!,"This is just a cheap cardboard and paper journal. No leather. No pouch. The ""faux"" look is cheesy, at best. Very disappointed in the product and in Amazon's misrepresentation of it."
5,katharsis in chaos,"For all those times, I thought they always had been fighting against something... maybe Japanese rock scene. But this time, I realized that they were not fighting till ""8"", although it might have been what seemed like endless struggles... Now, their music had evolved something different. In this album, four very talented artists unfold their musicianship and playability. This is a battle over their friendship and musical rivalry. And they leave us with a beautiful immage of them walking long winding road, together, with some insecurity. On Jan. 8, 2001, after finishing the first Tokyo Dome live a success, they are taking off. I must pray for them to come back someday."
5,The 212th Battalion is on the march!,"This trooper is an awesome addition to your collection! The paint job is better than any other clone, with scratch and scuff marks everywhere, just like in the movie.The sculpt is awesome, but has one problem. The belt is upside down, but that is a virtually unnoticable.As for accesories, this figure is a winner and a loser. I love the DC-15 Blaster Carbine the figure includes, but he needs a rifle too! He has an anntenea backpack which adds to the play value. Also included is a personalized display base and a randoomly packed hologram figure. Mine was a stormtrooper, but your trooper might include a different mini hologram!The box is really cool too, it depicts the troopers in a battle on the sinkhole planet of Utapau.Articulation? GREAT! Since he's the same sculpt as the 41 trooper, he has all the articulation he needs for numerous poses.Get one if you find one!"
3,Still same old card,There is no question that this is a awsome color but it is still the same old standered playstation memory card. You still have a hard time finding space on the card when you want to save if you have an expansive game collection like me and I would assume many other people. I still recommend one of those bigger memory cards where you can store games and not have to delete one of your precious saves.
4,Still rocking the original Playstation,"I frequently find myself drawn to the PSX when I get a craving to replay Final Fantasy VII, Silent Hill, Chrono Trigger, Metal Gear Solid, or Syphon Filter. I needed more memory space since I don't like overwriting previous saved games and this card has worked fine so far. No problems retrieving data, no glitches at all."
1,horrible service,"0 to be truthful, i was not only sent a memory card that was not sony brand, it was also defective. I eventually gave up and asked for a refund.this seller has bad practice."
5,Extremely comfortable,I can't believe how quiet and comfortable this shaver is and the battery last a long time.
2,Ferrari of Shavers,"I purchased an older relative of this shaver 3 years ago, impressed with the whole faster motor thing. It performed extremely well, as I used it almost exclusively wet in the shower.About a year ago, the older model started conking out and after some research, I decided to once again go for the panasonic linear 13000 engine.This time, it took only 4 months for a breakdown to occur. The shaver went completely dead one day. After negotiating Panasonic's immature site for service support, I was directed to send it off to San Francisco for repair under warranty. Two weeks later, when checking for status, I was told I should have sent to to Connecticut. Three weeks later, they needed to order parts. Expected delivery in 5 weeks.Bottom line: Excellent shaver when it works. But reliability is a big concern as Panasonic contines to struggle with the battery power and the electronics inside. Service is well below market standards for such a large company."
1,short battery life - Virtually no technical support,"This is my second Panasonic. First one bought in 1999 (es8067) still works, but I wanted an updated model. The ES8092NC worked great for four months then wouldn't charge. It is virtually impossible to get a response from Panasonic Customer support. 2 hrs of calling support and never reached a human. Finally received a response through their web form and they told me to deal with a no-name company 200 miles away."
3,"Good shave, but didn't last long","Worked great: close shave, wet shaving is wonderful, prevents nicks, etc. But...The product stop working after 11 months. Called tech support's 1-800 number but was told to call long distance to New York to obtain a fix. After being on hold (and paying) for a long time, I just hung up. I already had a feeling that all the fees and other charges would be more than the price of a new one, which is now under $80. I will think twice before I buy another Panasonic product again."
2,Disappointed with how long a shave takes,"I use this as a dry shaver, not wet.I find that I must make 3 or even 4 passes to get a clean shave. It does produce a fairly close shave in the end and has minimal irritation. But I am rather disappointed with how much work it is and how long it takes to get done for a shaver that costs this much.I have given it a fair chance for a year and I am now looking at other razors."
5,A delight with each bite!,"Hubs and I have never had Marzipan before, and were curious to try some. We thought this one sounded good, so we ordered, and it arrived in pretty good time. We both loved the sweet toasted almond flavor of this product, my husband even more so over another one we ordered at the same time- a De la Rosa Peanut Marzipan candy he felt was way too sweet, even though I also liked this one myself. Soft chewy consistency, they were a delight with each bite. We would definitely consider ordering more of this in the future for an occasional special treat.Lillia~ Bob's Wife"
1,"Dry, too sweet, intense","Having brought back toasted marzipans from a recent visit to Spain which were simply delicious, I ordered these thinking what a convenient way to get more. Unfortunately, while the package arrived thoughtfully packed complete with a cooling pad and insulated thermal wrap, the marzipans were a disappointment. They were very dry, too sugary sweet and had an overly intense almond flavor, almost pungent."
3,Good flavor but not fresh,"Obviously the BEST martzipan is Germany!! These had a unique and good flavor but they did not arrive very fresh, they were a little tough around the edges."
5,IntraMax,"This is an excellent product. I suffered of dizziness and also I had a cyst, I start to take IntraMax three weeks before the biopsy and First My God and second this medicine when I went to the byopsy the cyst was dissapearred. Two of my systers are taking, one should have a sugery and she told me she feel better and she canceled the surgery. The other one is ok, but she is taking the medicine for prevention. She said that she has more energy since she is taking IntraMax. Also I have a few friends that start to use IntraMax."
4,"Excellent, High Quality All-In-One Supplement","This product has over 400 healthy supplements combined together. I got it because I was tired of popping a million supplement pills. This supplement works very well and I have seen improvement in my bloodwork. So, I can attest that this is a very good product. The only drawback is the Peach-Mango flavour. It's not bad and it's not enough to put me off completely, but it could be better. It reminds me of a thinner version of Twin Lab's Amino Fuel, except not as acidic and not as bad. I will buy it again. Highly Recommended for your good health."
5,Miracle Medicine,My wife started taking this to help with her Psoriactic Arthritis. After 6 months she was off all meds and after a couple years her ANA was back to normal. We all take it now and feel better than ever.
5,good purchase with fast delivery,"I ordered the product, received it right away, it was packaged appropriately and overall was an excellent sale. Would recommend it to others and will reorder again."
3,Don't think it's worth the price,"I've been through 2 bottles of Intramax and don't know what all the fuss is about. I was very hopeful after reading loads of reviews on various sites, but ended up being disappointed. The taste is okay, but honestly I don't see how it can be so all encompassing as it claims. I still had muscle cramps, trouble sleeping, hot flashes, low energy levels, headaches, and poor appetite. It didn't change anything for me. I ended up implementing some other changes after I realized Intramax wasn't doing anything. The other changes actually made a difference. So I'm no longer shelling out $80 for Intramax. Use it if you want, but I'm not buying it."
1,Healthy but tastes pretty bad,"I bought some to try cause of the health benefits, I've heard that this is one of the healthier kinds of tea. I dunno, guess I'm just not a Pu-Erh person. It tasted awful to me. Smelled funky too. I would not reccomend it unless you're a very serious tea drinker."
5,Incredible study on how to live your life to the fullest,"So many aspects to self-help. I haven't quit talking about this book since I read it 3 weeks ago. I have purchased 3 copies so far to hand out as presents. Everybody should read this no matter what your age, you will gain a positive insight. It was recommended to me by my therapist who has been passing the ""word""of Watermelon Magic on to everyone who will listen. I will be giving this book as a present to everyone that I know who has a birthday this year or Christmas or just ""because they need it"". The only unfortunate thing is that it is not on audio tape for the blind. Work on that"
2,The sound is terrible indeed.,"I read the last review too late: the sound is indeed terrible. I have been listening to quite a lot of historic recordings like Busoni on the piano, the Liszt's Pupils, Schnabel/Szegeti, Busch/Serkin, Bartok, Rachmaninoff on the piano... etc but none is more unacceptable than this one even in view of it's low price. Go for another version."
2,"Clever title, but little else!","First of all, the recipes in this book are NOT especially ""quick and easy, so you can spend more time on the beach."" Most of them looked pretty time-consuming to me. Secondly, they're all recipes that you probably already have: Gazpacho, grilled shrimp, lobster rolls, mango salsa, pasta salads with chicken, lemon-glazed poundcake with berries, apple crisp... I have to confess that I didn't try any of them (because nothing seemed the slightest bit new or original). The recipes may work fine for all I know -- but I think that if you already have cookbooks like Barefoot Contessa, Silver Palate or any of the other classics, you really don't need this one."
4,Don't turn your back on this guy!,"Fiendishly demented figure! The chainsaw growls ferociously in the background of this awfully detailed display. Big and heavy, will certainly scare any of whom carry a faint heart. Better get on your R1 and ride away....d."
3,Garter grief,"The garters were made well, but they should tell you in the information that they are basically arm bands- I had to take them apart and sew two of them together to make a leg garter."
3,Repetitive.,"I love Sesame Street, especially the old episodes. This DVD set only has a few clips or many different episodes. If you watch this once you really don't need to watch it again."
3,Thought it would be funnier,"Some of these sketches are great, and I liked the aspect of the 1st disc being more ""classics"" and the 2nd disc being the newer spoofs. I was disappointed that the 1st disc is more just plain outdated than classic. I'm 28 and watched SS as a child my daughter is 5 and neither of us could figure out what they were spoofing, and grew tired and bored of the disc. I wanted to like this a lot more than I did."
3,Not what I expected...,"I couldn't wait for my kids to see this, cause I figured spoofs meant the funnys or mishaps of sesame street... Well this is a large bunch of funny like videos, but if you own Alot of sesame street as I do, You've seen most of it before, making it not much funny... These videos are not exactly mishaps at all... Just more fun videos and repeats of ...I was disappointed; I was actually looking forward to something different, like oops... or I don't know... Just what they did was put another name on a large collection of sesame street videos."
4,This game is good.,"So you didn't take the time to look into the games options to see most statistical aspects are able to be tweaked to your liking. Or that if there are a bit too many blocks for your skill level, you might want to play a lower level. One thing: This game is very good. I didn't like the camera settings, at first. Then I used a different television. I liked the camera angle. Its a game I like easily, just like many probably dislike it easily. If I've confused you, its only because I truly am confused."
4,March Madness 2000,"The game is a vast improvement from last year's edition, but it is still could use some improvements."
2,Not a very good game,"I love every EA sports game I have ever picked up, except this one. I can't understand how the same company can produce the greatest basketball game I've played - NBA Live 2000, and the worst - this one. The graphics are sub-standard, the game play is not smooth, some of the controls don't always do what you want them to. On anything above the lowest difficulty level, the computer will block every shot you take in the paint.I am very frustrated by this game. I think I may trade this in for Final Four 2000 by 989 sports. I usually don't like their games, but it can't be any worse than this one."
3,March Madness 2000 Review,"I think that the folks at EA Sports should just take the same program they use for NBA LIVE 2000, and change it for College Hoops. It's great that Dick Vitale was on their, however, the problem that I have with the game is I'm so use to using my Analog Controller on my other games, I was very disappointed you can't use it on March Madness. Second of all, it's not good that you can't even bring the ball across half court without it getting stolen, and then you have a wide open jumpshot get blocked. It's not as good as March Madness 1999."
5,An excellent game. I thought it couldn't get any better!,"Well with the introduction of 60 legends(and me being a basketball fanatic) makes this game brillant. Also with Michael Jordan finally in the game(no longer 99 or 23) Also with the inclusion of all the rookies. No basketball game will beat this for long,long time."
2,"but okay , time passer /Xavier jamal dobbs ,tight",this game is ok SIGH .but i probaly think they should stop selling ...like this . i was disapointed the graphics ... and you cant control other players. but this the kind game you play when you cant play real basketball .i would much prefer NBA showtime NBA NBC or NBA LIVE 2001.but mostly its just a time passer.
3,REAL EA SPORTS FAN,"This game is by far the best basketball game for the playstation, but it still a major disappointment for sport fans. The graphics aren't that great and the game is far from realistic. Until another company challenges EA SPORTS or they stop holding back their best features basketball video gameplayers will have nothing better to look forward to in the future."
2,Not That Good,"I have been purchasing NBA Live since the Sega Genesis days. I waited anxiously for the release of 2000 expecting a stellar game due to new competition form the Dreamcast, I was very dissapointed. The game is better in part due to the old classic teams and the MJ one on one but the graphics I belive actually got worse if you can believe it. I think they spent too much time focusing on the teams and MJ and the graphics suffered. NBA 2K on Dreamcast is ten times better, they really took the time to make that game realistic, EA slipped on 2000."
5,NBA Live 2000,NBA Live for 2000 is the best basket ball game i hav ever played. The only con i hav found is the their is NO FRANCHISE MODE. but i guess EA needs something to add next year. if your lookin for a game for someone even they don't like basket ball.if they give it time they'll love this game.
4,Right difficulty level hard to find,"This is a fun, well-made game. However, I am playing a season right now on the ""rookie"" mode, and by the second quarter, I am already blowing the other team out. I can leave one of my guys at the other end of the floor and still make a defensive stop. When I tried the ""starter"" mode(next highest difficulty level), the defenders were on me like leeches, and I couldn't move very well. I'll have to see what happens after I finish my current season. But for now, it looks like to me that the easy's too easy and the hard's too hard. But everything else is cool, and the game is fun. I'm really impressed with the in-game stats they put on the screen and the automatic substitutions. That makes my job as player/coach a lot easier."
1,This Games Stinks,I just got this game today.I thought it wiould be as good as Live 99 but the graphics are bad.There camera angle is bad because it is on the sidelie and you just see in front of you.I just got this game because of how I liked the other NBA Live games.But after playing this game I realize that it is worse then NBA Live 99.I know this because I have played every NBA Live game since the 95 game came out.I think this is the worset of them all.
2,Terrible,"When I first got this game, I loved it! But then something happened. I had just beaten MJ 1-on-1 and had swept the first round of the playoffs. I was playing the Grizzlies in Vancouver an was up 19-8. I was the Lakers and had a created player that was better than Jordan as my PF. He was subbed out and Horry was in. They went on an 11-0 run, but I thought I could still win. With 3 seconds left, I was up 42-41, even though They just hit 2 straight threes. Bryant fouled their best shotter, he made both free throws and I lost. Overall, People are airheads on the road , created players stink(no matter how good they are), and payers from long ago are EXTREMLEY underrated(Jordan included)."
3,Much Improvement Needed!,"First - what I like about the game. With NBA Live 2K - a hard foul is really a hard foul. In the older versions the basketball would always go in the basket after a foul. With the new version -- you're lucky to make a shot if you're fouled. One other nice thing -- players shooting airballs.Now, for the meat of my review. The graphics have gotten worse. There are no realistic dimensions for the players. The facial features are a horrible likeness. NBA Live 99 physical features of the player were MUCH better. Heavy overweight players look now look like a Jenny Craig/Richard Simmons hybrid.The game play is just too similar to Live 99. Where's the improvement. Although Jordan is in this game. It's not worth the loot.I can't wait until 989 Sports begin making NCAA and NBA sports games. Their graphics and gameplay are far superior to EA Sports."
1,ea sports?,this game stinks.i would give this game a zero if i could.the only thing good about this game is the 3 point shooting contest.besides that everything else is messed up.
3,Not the Best Figure Out There,"This figure looks and feels great as a display, but it's not as good as a toy. While the looks of the figure are excellent the figure is not very poseable. The free hand included to switch with the lightsaber hand is rather small and can be lost easily. The figure is the ""hack and slash"" type, which means that it won't sit down and therefore is useless with starships or speeders. If you want the figure for display or stritcly for hack and slash lightsaber combat then it'll do fine, otherwise, consider looking for another one."
2,Can see why Anakin turned to the Dark Side with this one...,"This figure is OK. Not great, not horrible but ahhhhh. I'm sure there is def a better one out there. The figure has a hand that comes off to put in a hand with a light saber. The problem is the hand is so small if it accidentally gets popped off, which mine did, forget about finding it. It'll eventually get vacuumed up once someone cleans up the house at the end of the day. Not really that good for the kiddies. It also doesn't bend at the knees making it hard to sit in the Jedi Starship. FAIL! I will prob have to buy another Anakin type of figure. Not recommended."
5,actually works,"I have had many caulk guns (other Newborns as well) in varying price ranges during my 4 year search trying to find just one that works consistently. After 20 or 30 of them, this one is the only one. Who knew the caulk gun so difficult to get right?"
4,ogio,"Outstanding backpack. Plenty of room, many compartments. Strong, solid and reliable. Great for motorcycle backpack with exception of not being waterproof. Otherwise, excellent backpack."
3,It was ok,"The book was OK. The author has a firm grasp on English. The story was unusual and fresh. And yet, to me it sounded artificial and stilted. Far better than a lot of the pap out there."
5,Great traveling bag,"I've had this bag for awhile and it has traveled with me all over the world. It is large enough to fit both a digital video camera and a digital camera inside easily. The same could be said for fitting an SLR camera inside. It has an area below the bag where you can store items like your USB wire, extra photo cards and anything else you need to store but don't need quick access to. This area is also removable from the bag so if you need to lighten the load for a bit it zippers right off and is put back on easily. The great part about this bag is not only does it work as a shoulder bag, you can easily transform it into a bag that goes around your waist. It is very comfortable. I would highly recommend this bag!"
4,The Devils Bride,A great movie. A classic great. If you like the Nineth Gate with Johnny Depp. You will love this moive. It maybe old but the wiritng and the performances are out standing. It will send a shiver down your spine.
4,Not for the faint at heart,"This is basically two short stories that focus on dominant men and the women they love. While the use of the word dominant may scare some away, it's truly just to show their desires and their unwillingness to pretend they don't exist. These men never leave their women unsatisfied and push them to their sexual limits, teaching them things they may only have fantasized about. If you like to a lot of steamy sex and alpha males, this one is for you."
4,SPICY,The book and series are full of hot sex and I prefer our men in these books to be of the Alpha Male and stay that way. This book sold me on the rest of the series and hopefully it will be a little more true to form on presenting an Alpha that knows he is one and wants to remain one.
3,Counterfeit Kisses - a hit no misses!,"Yet again, another ""can't put it down"" book from the hand of Sandra Heath, as we have all come to expect. Every story has so many twists and turns that you can't help but get engrossed with the characters and the plot. It is such a shame that although wmr-uk seems to know the book inside out and memorised the story completely, she seems to think it was ""tedious and unconvincing"". But as the criticism was more of a personal embittered attack at Sandra Heath, as opposed to a review of a novel, I think it can be taken with a pinch of salt. Keep up the good work Sandra Heath, as your books just get better and better!"
3,Not Standard Size,Was not clear from the advertisement that these boards are non-standard size. I expected this to be a tournament sized roll-up board. Instead It's a miniature board. Extremely disappointing.
1,BUYER BEWARE: order from Kandels Korner turned out to be a fake,"I ordered the ""PS One Island Blue Memory Card [PlayStation]"" NEW CONDITION from the lowest price store KANDELS KORNER. What I received instead was not a blue memory card but a Grey ps1 memory card, in a plastic case which was inside a flimsy cardboard sony box cover with oriental symbols on the outside of the box. I think this memory card is the classic grey memory card that shipped with the first psxs. Basically I did not get what I ordered and the product wasn't even in the condition they labeled it as. The memory card could have easily been used since the outer box was not sealed. Although its the wrong product, the memory card did work when I tested it out, and it saves and loads games fine so far."
3,island blue memory card,bought this for a christmas gift so don't know if it works yet...but it looks like it's supposed to & arrived in the condition it said & on time.
4,get the real one,i got other memory cards that were not sony they dont work in ps 2 this one does...get the real one
2,"Update 4Oct2010, it is beginning to fail on me.","Works great with my PS2 to let me save PS1 games as I play them through. Woohoo!Update: It is starting to take several tries and removing it and plugging it back in to get it to save or load data. Lasted almost two years, is that good? I don't think so."
5,Great working charger,This charger works great. It arrived very quickly. This worked with a new battery I purchased. I recommend it.
4,great seller and item,Even though the battery charger was used it looks brand new. It works great and i received it in a timely manner. Thanks
1,Unsatisfied,Unfortunately I have to be honest and say that when I received this Ryobi Charger it didnt even work. I will say that I did receive it right away which was nice but unfortunately it doesnt work so I am very unsatisfied. Also I didnt bother to try to contact the people sothat is my own fault there i didnt give them a chance to resolve the problem because I didnt know where the box was at that it came in to get in touchwith the place i bought it at.
3,micro camera case,"nice case. two compartments. durable exterior nylon.Large drawback for me is that shoulder strap is not removable. i like to wear the case on my belt- have to let the strap hang down. should have been removable with clips. had i known, i wouldn't have bought it."
2,Too tiny to be useful,"I'm extremely disappointed by this camera case - since there aren't any measurements listed here on Amazon, I took a chance on buying this based on the description for my Fuji 1400 digicam. The case I received is only big enough to hold a Canon Elph (the credit-card sized cameras) - anything larger won't fit. It looks like it's built well (hence the two stars), but it is far too small to be of any use for anything larger than an Elph."
2,Yolandita Mongue,This CD contains songs that I never heard before of Yolandita Mongue. The item does not list the songs so it was difficult to know what songs were included until after I had purchased the CD. I am not quite a fan of the songs in this CD and prefer the later music recorded by Yolandita Mongue.
4,A must for all serious martial artists,"The book offers detailed pictures of Master Cho in action. Master Cho correctly goes over every basic kick in great detail, pointing out common errors in executing a particular kick."
3,it's ok,"This is an ok toy, my rabbit enjoys it but I have to be careful because the little sticks come out easily and I am worried she will choke (they aren't really that small but I still worry). We took the nut out (because again nuts are not good for bunnies) and she flings this thing around and has fun with it. Don't know if I would get another one though."
2,atomic77,MY RABBIT DIDN'T CARE FOR THIS AT ALL -- SHE LIKE TO PLAY WITH OLD TOWLES AND CARD BOARD BOXES
3,I would not purchase again,"I thought it was a little pricey but colorful and neat looking. Our hamster climbs on it, chews on it and has taken a few sticks out of it, but since then I read that you should only give ""natural"" wood to hamsters. I'm sure the dye is nontoxic so I'm leaving it in her cage for now but because I am trying to provide the best care, I will no longer purchase colorful wood toys. Just my opinion from my own research."
2,Not good for rats,"We have two rats, and one of them loves to chew on everything. She even managed to chew through 2 inches of plastic once. She chewed on this toy until the tiny orange pegs were worn down (maybe one day) and hasn't touched it since."
2,2 STARS,It depends on how smart your rodent is i got this for my 2 female gerbils and it broke apart because it was put together by small wooden sticks i guess it is good for chewing on but I was concerned when it broke because I read if gerbil or hamsters have nuts that are to big for them they can get a disease
4,Saving Private...........,"This game was alot of fun, because it is the first 1st person shooter, that I can recall, which deals with WW2. The levels were rather easy, as I beat the game in about a week, but I did truly enjoy the game. Everything about the game is detailed to a tee. The vintage WW2 weapons: Tommy Guns, BARs, M-1s, and those cool German grenades with the wooden handles, the uniforms and vehicles, and even the German soldiers shouting in German at you! Speaking of the Germans, the enemies in this game were incredibly inteligent; shooting around corners, throwing live grenades back at you, and continuing to fire their weapons even though they have been shot. If anyone is looking for a video game version of ""Saving Private Ryan"", this is the one for you. Not as much fun as Bond, and the multiplayer isn't that good, but the controls and gameplay are what make this shooter stand out."
5,The first of its kind!!,"Ok everybody this is the first serious WW2 game to come along, and it captivated America. From the scenes straight from saving private ryan to the sound that was almost erie this is an all around game.I personally own this game and can truly testify to the graphics, and personna that make up Medal of Honor. This game takes you beyond what you would expect from an aversge game, it takes you to the inner workings of the German war machine. You personally try to dismantle the nazis and try for the right of the Medal of Honor."
1,boring predictable crap,"I have one question. Can you play from the point of view of a german soldier? No you say? Then what in hell is the goddamn point??? If i can't be a mean, grizzled, ss seargant, or a tough fallschirmjager, blasting away at tom hanks looking g.i.'s with an mp-40 in both hands, then i don't want to be anything at all.peace."
1,One of the worst,This game is one of the worst i have played yet for the new Dreamcast. The controls are so annoying that I litteraly wanted to give the game back after an hour. I gave it more time but after a week I still wanted to give it back. Do not buy it if you know what is good for you.
5,One of the best games for Playstation.,If you dont like to much gore then this game good for you because the bad guys disapear after they are killed. The graphics are good too.
5,medal of honor a great game,this was a good game it got here in time for christmas thanks to the Goodwill of California. thanks so much for a great product. and in a timely manner.
5,open fire,medal of honor is one of the best games on the playstation. i think the ww2 idea is good. its exciting to play. those who have played syphon filter will probably like this game. it has many different weapons. some levels are easy and some are challenging. the sound effects are good. the film intros are enjoyable if not a little short. i found that the multi play was poor quality. i was a little disappointed with the end as i was expecting a big finish.
5,Intense! Incredible gameplay.,This game has so many attributes! The gameplay is so good. As you through a grenade the nazis may be totally aware of it and run or they may get nailed hardcore! As the grenade lands expect the Germans to kick it back in your direction some times! Make sure to kill everyone. If you have a not aimed well shot the Nazi will fall to the ground and get back up and rejoin battle! This game has the best music sequences. They fit the prediciment that you're in and the time setting as well. Get this game!
5,Interactive History Channel,"Alot of people have reviewed this game. Some loved it, others hated it. I myself am going to have to side with the former. Granted, some aspects of the game could be improved, like the hard-to-master control,the rather dark and difficult to see graphics,and the fact that German troops can absorb many bullets and keep on coming. but hey, this is a game. If you are a history nut (especially WWII), then this game is for you. You'll find yourself pulled into the game, and you'll catch yourself peeking around corners hoping not to run into a squad of Wermacht infantry. The weapons, uniforms, and scenery are authentic, and finely detailed. All in all, this is a game worthy of anyone who likes WWII, shooter games, and mission oriented game objectives. Trust me when I say that playing this game will give you the strange urge to watch the History Channel."
5,A Must Have For The Playstation,"I could go on about how engaging Medal of Honor is, but here's the short version--The details are great, from the muzzle climb of your Thompsom SMG, to your character's college report card! The missions, enemy AI, and atmospheres are realistic and convincing.Sound is near perfect, including the movie-quality soundtrack which was composed just for this game. MOH's replay value is substantial, as you'll find yourself coming back to previously played levels to shoot some more of those conniving Nazis.The only downers in MOH are the sometimes-grainy graphics, slightly glitchy collision detection, and single difficulty level. These will probably be overlooked when you find the Bazooka and a couple boxes of ammo:)"
3,NOT THE BEST GAME OF THE YEAR!,"THIS GAME IS A BLAST AT FIRST BUT ONCE YOU HAVE BEATEN AROUND 4 LEVELS YOU WILL BE BOARD STIFF OF THIS GAME. EVERY LEVEL IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE OTHER. IT IS JUST ANOTHER UNDERCOVER MISSION OBLECTIVES SORTA THING. IF THAT IS THE STYLE YOU WANT THEN GET THE GAME BECAUSE YOU WILL HAVE A BLAST WITH. THE GRAPHICS ARE SO, SO BUT IT ISNT AN ACTION PACKED GAME. THAT IS WHY I GIVE IT ONLY *** ON A SCALE OF 1-5. HOPE THIS REVIEW WAS HELPFUL TO ALL OF YOU AND THANK YOU FOR READING IT."
1,Terrible controls,"Interesting idea, but after playing for ten minutes, the game movement became very disorientating and confusing. Aiming the rifle is unneccessarily difficult (syphon filter for example). Great idea, but ultimately the headache creating controls are a major negative"
5,tremendous in every way,"i don't know how much steven spielberg had to do with this game, but to me it succeeds in the same way the best of his films do. the graphics aren't the best ever, the playability isn't either. i've heard better sound (actually maybe MOH does win on that count) and i've completed more challenging challenges. but when you take the game as a whole - the atmosphere, the thinking that went into it, just the whole experience - Medal of Honor is in my mind the best game available on playstation."
5,Medal Of Honor.......Gaming at it's best!,"Medal of Honor goes where no other Playstation game ever went. This game has great effects, realistic hits, and just makes you part of the game. This is one the few games out there that actually puts you in the game. Wherever you put your soldier, they make you feel like you are there. This is a game you can't put down. I played it days on end, and still can't wait to play again. Definately the best shooter game ever."
5,In All Things Modulation,"If you have ever felt like the overly sequenced and mechanized sound that defines so much electronica is a little too cold for your senses and the incessant noodling and ""improvisation"" of so much jazz and jam music mines the depths of your patience, then check out this release. In a way I have yet to see with other artists, this album combines the best of both of these wide-ranging musical genres. It's sonically rough around the edges at points, creamy smooth at others. It is a great dance party album, but you could also just sit down, jazz cigarette in hand, and chill reflectively in headphone land.If this is their first offering, I'd say we have much to look forward to from this welcome addition to DC's electronic music community."
2,Smaller Than Description,"I bought this bag to hold a Canon Digital Rebel 35MMcamera. The description lead me to believe there wasenough space to hold the camera, an extra lens andflash. This simply is not true. The camera will fitsideways with a lens attached if one of the dividersis removed. This will leave space for a small extra lens orflash unit in the other space, but has rendered the baguseless to me.If you have a digital camera with a built in lens, thismight be a good choice, but for an SLR digital, looksomewhere else.I recommend going to a camera store and ""try before you buy""."
3,It is really Smaller Than Description,"Surely it is a good bag, with good design, good quality and nice price. It could deserve 5 stars, but before purchase, please make sure you do not want to hold a Canon 20D plus Canon 24-70mm F2.8L lens and one Canon 70-300 IS lens. It is really smaller than description. But the size is good for some smaller camera, like Rebel XT with some short prime lens like Canon 50mm f1.8 etc. Now I have to make it as bag for my lens, not for my camera."
4,Good bag if you don't have much equipment,"This is a good bag to hold your SLR body, a 28-80 lense and an assortment of filters (in their cases) and other small items. Front pouch easily holds up to 6 rolls of film and cleaning kit. This bag definitely will not hold more than one lense with the body on the inside. But it securely stores your gear and is lightweight and easy to carry around. A good buy for the money."
2,Kafka's Vegetable Love,"[ASIN:1579651682 Vegetable Love]]There is no doubt Kafka is knowledgeable. However, I want COLORED PICTURES with the recipes. Pictures are worth a thousand words...far more instructive and inspirational to me. I don't want a biblical history lesson about vegetables. A few words about them go a long way. Kafka's book is a LOT to wade through and I don't have that kind of time. I would have liked to see a preview of what I was getting before I bought it. It was also quite expensive. I gave it a shot, but it sadly wasn't what I wanted."
1,wow,"How the hell did this lame effort get recorded and released?? Why? Whose bad idea was this?In the period 1955 - '65 tens of thousands of kids across the USA played these pieces this badly, or perhaps less badly, myself among them. Ditto 10 years later, 20 years later, and 30 years later, when my own kids did so. Keane even makes the same mistakes at the same rough spots I did.Whoever wrote the metronome/Hannon advice is spot-on. Hands separately, then together. Bring out the appropriate voices. (Listening) Please, God, make it stop hurting. This is *not* to be encouraged or repeated. Back to the Fortnightly Musical Club for KK.Please tell me this was not her parents' and teacher's doing. The late teachers Marley Johnson and Allen Barker, like hundreds elsewhere across the decades, are cringing, patiently but firmly, in their graves."
2,picked the wrong book lol,"if your kid is that gifted then maybe there better off going to a less prestigious university where he/she can excel. if they can accepted more power to them. my only concern is that this only apply to high school seniors. i would have liked that she include something about community college students, but i guess i picked the wrong book."
5,A Good one to read.,"This book is very good for parents who have no clue about how to help get their child into college. I thought the book would offer me many new ideas, but only found a few. The parents in my district are quite savy about knowing the tricks of the trade. Many of the ideas are listed in this book.I will say that the book gave me confidence that I am doing all that I can do to help my son get into a college. I live in the competitive northeast where we need every edge possible.If I could do it over, I would borrow the book from the library or from a friend. Does anybody want to buy my book?"
1,For helicopter parents only,"If you want your kids to think well of you and your relationship in the future, read another book. This one sends both kids and parents on a hyped-up quest that may -- or more likely may not -- get teens into a school they think they want to go to because, well, everyone else does. And if that is not a school for which they are suited, well I guess that's their problem. Er, make that yours too. Many tens of thousands of dollars and lots of tears later."
3,"Okay, but some other guides are better","I found this title somewhat useful, and especially liked the interviw tips. But some of the emphasis still seems to be on getting your child into a school that, in the long run, might not suit them. Better titles for finding good fit schools and succesfully applying to them are HARVARD SCHMARVARD and -- especially -- GETTING IN WITHOUT FREAKING OUT ."
1,Didn't read,"I did not read this book, but from the excerpts and other reader reviews, it sounds exactly like what is wrong with the world of helicopter parenting. Shouldn't kids be taught to make their way in the world by themselves; based upon true merit, and ethically at that? Sounds like the authors, and parents who loved this book, need to read some ""Love and Logic"" books."
3,Metal is weak,"This is really nice, thin, but the metal ring is really soft. I dropped it on my deck and the outer metal ring bent, now I can't screw anything onto this filter... But it's a nice CPL"
2,Poor build quality,"I bought this filter last winter. I used it sparingly and it works as expected. However, last week while shooting in Washington D.C., the inner ring which rotates the polarizer came off. It was dark, so I could collect only one piece of the glass element.I have contacted the support department THK Photo Products today. I will be sending this to their repair dept. Let's see how do they respond.To be fair, I will see how the customer service dept of Hoya takes care of this case. If I get a good service(in this case a replacement) I do not mind buying Hoya products in future. Let's see..."
3,Good Polarizer,I bought this Hoya polarizer for my Canon 10-22 mm zoom lens. It works great despite slight vignetting in the corners. I still would vouch for it despite this small inconvenience.
3,"Exploring Microsoft Office 2000 Professional, v. 1","Well laid out, high physical quality, effectively written text good for teaching pure beginners how to use this tool [and even v.1 has some tips for those who are experienced] with lots of useful exercises. What limits this to 3 stars is the fact that OUTLOOK 2000 is not covered in any way whatsoever, despite the fact that it is an essential part of OFFICE which is heavily used in many organizations. The index also proved lacking when I wanted to find out about 'speaker's notes' in POWER POINT."
3,a bit disappointed,I did not understand that this would be a group of women discussing the book and not some of the principles taught that reflect the book.
3,"Shiny, but not polished","I was expecting great things of this game, due to the rave reviews it recieved and also the recommendations that people buy this game if they couldn't get ahold of Gran Turismo 2. While the game does have good graphics, responsive control, and a soundtrack that rivals the best, it does have a few flaws.It is far too easy for an opponent to flip your car onto its side, and even a little brush up against the side of the track sends you airborn. This hinders game play severly and prevents a higher rating, simply due to the fact that frustration sets in; something that shouldn't be overtly present in a five-star game.If you can manage to get over the fact that your car is on its side and top more than you would like, then this is the rally game for you. If not, perhaps Gran Turismo 2's rally race option will be more to your liking."
5,V-Rally 2,Best racing game on the Playststion (except for GT2 which I have not played yet). However it will have to be really good to beat V-rally 2. I purchased a Wheel (Concept 4) and that makes it even more realistic. For all racing fans (especially those who love ralling) this is a must buy!
2,"Pretty colors, but too many flaws in the glass.","The pastel colors are pretty, but the glass had many flaws. I had purchased the set to use as a gift. I opted not to give it. On the plus side, this set would look nice in an Easter table setting and if they get broken your not out much."
3,NOT FOR ME,"IT WAS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS. BUT, IT IS NOT A REAL BAD MOVIE. IF YOU LIKE THINGS LIKE THIS ONE. YOU DON'T KNOW UNTIL YOU TRY."
3,all of Highsmith's talents in bite-sized pieces,"Highsmith is noted for her novels of odd (read: neurotic) individuals who often exhibit some sort of criminial behaviour. I am certainly a Highsmith devotee. 'Eleven', a collection of 11 short stories, is my first taste of Patricia Highsmith in smaller doses.As with most collections of short stories, 'Eleven' is a hit-and-miss affair. The stories are at minimum competent, with a couple being quite interesting (, creepy, weird, et al). Unfortunately unlike with her novels, these compact stories do not play to Highsmith's strengths - that is, dissecting her characters and their phobias.However I do recommend 'Eleven' for those who simply don't have the time or patience to read Highsmith's novels. It certainly makes for excellent commuting reading material."
5,A world of obsessions.,"Patricia Highsmith is a wonderful story teller, and with Eleven she masters the short story genre. Her tales are not easy; its a world of strange and obssesive people who always push their obsessions to the limit, and you as a reader will feel involved in this claustrophobic world. So beware when you're reading it, you may feel someone strangely breathing on your neck."
5,"Creepy, Unsettling and Fantastic","This is Highsmith's collection of 11 short stories, written from 1945 to 1970, and a phenomenal read. Writing with an economical, non-showy style, she pulls you into the characters, their emotions, and the underlying threat of every story so effortlessly that you mistrust her literary intentions from the first -- and are cursing her name by the end of the story for making your heart pound outside your chest until it's ready to burst. ""The Birds Poised to Fly"" is a creepy, obsessive little ditty about the nature of infatuation, while ""The Heroine"" still manages to shock despite the obvious direction of the story. My other favorites were ""The Terrapin"" about the fate of a turtle and the family who cooks him, and ""Another Bridge to Cross"" a wonderfully somber and affecting story about loss, disillusionment and the need to go on."
2,Get the PC or GBA versions instead.,"I picked this up for free pretty much, I didnt know what to expect. I liked the PC and GBC versions, but this one has gone a completly different way. It only has one veiw, from behind. It would have been so much better to have a top view(sky cam) or veiw from the side like in Hot Wheels Stunt Something that are on GB and PC and probably every other platform. The one veiw is just no good.It's not at all hard to play. But it's got no real challenge to it, the graphics may be better then the side angled other version of Hot Wheels games, but this one being from behind and all, it is not as much fun.This game would be great for kids under 13, especiely under 6.. the controls are ok I guess, the graphics arnt so bad but could have been a lot better, the commentry is annoying till you turn it down.Buy it for the kids maybe, but anyone into a real race game will find it's lack of reply value disapointing."
2,Cheap quality for not such a cheap price,"Considering the Superwinch S5000 is an amazing powerhorse, I expected a pretty good cover, considering it cost me $35 bucks. Not really. Not only the cover doesn't fit the winch properly, but it doesn't cover it entirely and the material rips even with the slightest pull. The tightening bands don't tighten up unless you tie it up.Basically, this is a quick solution for people with no time and a little money to spare. This was my case, though I'm considering having a descent cover made. I use the winch on my boat to lift stuff, so it's exposed entirely. This cover won't protect it right from rain and I wonder how long it will last in the sun. China has been doing a lot of good quality products lately, but this isn't one of them. If you have the time, make a cover yourself."
1,Very Poor,"Bland, boring - say what you will, but this isn't rock & roll, just pop drivel. Strum away all night guys, but market correctly: this is watered-down, derivative, wholesome folk rock for geezers. Portnoy is obviously drunk, as he simply goes through the motions, playing extremely basic first-year rock licks, thinking of his paycheck. The real trouble with this package is the coat-tail grabbing desperation of the Pink Floyd cover. DO NOT expect any ""transcendental"" musicianship or quality, just annoying & pointless effluvia, trite arrangements, and hackneyed psychedelic C-list has-beens."
3,SMALL BAG,"I got this bag and it is small. I can fit my E 500 with one lens attached, one extra lens, battery charger, USB cable, extra battery, lens hood and everthing is full and its tight. Secondly, on the back it is a small bag than a regular bagpack. When you have to take it out, you will have difficulty but if you want to change the lens also, you will need a place to put it, cannot do it standing or need a help. A normal 57 inch tripod will hang on the back but it will be hanging.Given a choice, I would not buy it again."
4,"Great quality, a bit small....","This backpack is a very high quality product and is very compact (too compact for me). I was so pleased with the quality, however, that I returned the item and just got the next size up, the Expedition 4."
3,Small but capable,"This backpack is a lot smaller than I expected... granted, I did not take the time to actually think about the measurements. Also I think the straps of the backpack are very uncomfortable. It's probably good for anyone who is not thinking of professional work... but I am already thinking about what I want in my next backpack."
5,Camera Backpack,"The Tamrac 5273 backpack is perfect for me. I am a novice photographer who carries his camera just about everywhere I go. I have had over the shoulder bags, but this is much better especially when shopping while on vacation. It's out of the way when in tight places and is not slipping off your shoulder. It is small and light but has plenty of space for all the accessories that I carry. It also holds them securely with the internal adjustable straps so your equipment is not rattling around and getting scratched."
4,"Great bag, a couple flaws","The bag works well overall and has many compartments and configuration options.My two problems were the straps killed my shoulders after a few hours. Mainly because they sewed leather strips onto the straps. This would drag my t-shirt, causing irritation. I had to cut off the leather strips. That wasn't too optimal.Second was the big lip covering the zipper makes it a bit tough to zipper quickly. It gets stuck several times in the opening and closing process.Even with those flaws, I still like the bag for its compactness, sturdiness, and style."
2,too small,"I bought this bag with the intention of going hiking with it. When I tried to get my Nikon D70 with 18mm - 70mm lense attached in the compartment that holds the camera, it was a tight fit. Then when I tried to add my 70mm - 300mm lense and SB-600 flash light along with other items, it would not all fit. This is a good item (and a good price) for an amateur photographer, but not for someone that needs to carry 3 lenses and a camera body along for the ride. The description of this backpack was way off it's mark."
4,A bit small but good for the money,"Although this is a small bag you can fit the essentials in it, I carry my Nikon D70 with a couple of lenses, the charger, and the lens cleaning kit and that all fits fine. I would have rated it a 5 but due to the tripod straps the main bag zipper can be a bit tricky to open."
2,Tamrac 5273 Review,I bought this Tamrac backpack with the expectation that it would be nearly identical with a Tamrac unit I had purchased earlier at my local photo retailer. While this unit can be made to work it doesn't do it with the same ease as my other unit. This is because the center dividers are just a bit too long which makes placing my Canon 10D digital camera in the center / back position a bit too tight. The materials are adequate but they lack the softness of my other unit. While this is subtle I can only say I much prefer the softer materials. My other backpack is basically the same size as this one but it works better because the dividers have better proportions. My advice is check out other units before you buy.
3,Not Large Enough,"This Item was smaller than I thought. It does not hold all of my euipment, but if you do not have a large amount of euipment, then it will be ok. As far as quality and durability, it is satisfactory."
4,Good Bag,"This bag is very good for a DSLR with 2 zooms and a macro. It also holds cleaning supplies, flash unit and charger."
2,Didn't expect this to be so small..,"I cant fit in the lenses with the hood. I have a 135mm zoom, 300mm zoom and a 55mm lens and every one has a hood. Its really hard to push them in with the hood.One good thing is it has lot of sponge which will protect the lens and the camera on a heavy drop.I like the tripod straps on the bag."
4,Nice little pack,"Almost too little for a backpack. It just doesn't sit well on the handsome build I had :) Plenty of compartments, excellently built & high quality too. Remember this only holds a mini-tripod, not a normal sized one."
3,Tight fit,"Overall not a bad bag. Gets to be a tight fit when you put in a camera w/ attached lens, an extra lens, batteries, and charger."
3,A bit smaller than expected,"I bought this to tote around my SLR and gadgets. It is a well designed pack, but a bit smaller than I had hoped for. It fits the camera body and my 3 lenses, but there is no room for the flash in the bag.Depending on the amount of stuff you want to cram in the bag it may or may not be a good fit.The price is right."
3,Tight squeeze,"This is a nice, well-made, durable backpack.It just arrived today and I immediately stuffed it with my Nikon D50 SLR, with an 18-55mm lens attached and 2 additional lenses. It was a VERY tight squeeze getting this little bit of gear into the backpack. The bag is bulging at the sides making it a bit of a pain to zip up. If I had it to do over, I would probably opt for something larger than this backpack but for what it is, and the price, it'll do. The good thing about it is that the space constraints can be somewhat alleviated by purchasing attachable lens cases such as the MX5378 and MX5375."
3,Tamarac photo backpack,"I like the versatility inside - meaning you can arrange the inside velcro panels to fit lenses, etc. I fit my camera body with 28-80 mm lens and a 70-210 mm and a 70-300 mm lens in the body of the bag and still have an extra ""compartment"" that I fill with film. Cons: 1)Description indicates it comes with the side straps etc for a water bottle or other gear - you actually have to purchase those separately.2) Not much space in the outer pockets. Once I get a few filters in, there isn't much room for my i.d or a notepad/book. 3) Straps are awkward to adjust. Pros: 1)Appears sturdy - its been on 5 planes with me and placed in the overhead bin with no trouble. 2)Doesn't announce that you are carrying a camera. 3) It is compact so if you can travel light it's great. I guess I just want to carry too much stuff. I would consider this pack in a larger size except that this one already gets heavy on long hikes."
3,Keeps the Camera Snug,"Works great for my nikon. I have two extra lenses: a lensbaby muse and a macro lens. They all fit snug along with the external SB 800 Flsh. I cannot imagine a telephoto lens fitting in the bag. This bag was brand new so i am sure it has to get worn in a bit, but very durable and many places to fit accesories. I am glad i have this bag because everything i need will fit in here."
3,Smaller than expected,"Was much smaller than I expected. I can barely fit a camera, a flash, a 24-100 mm lens and a 100-300 mm lens. I wish I had picked a larger bag. Although I will say the quality appears excellent."
1,Tiny,"I knew I was buying a small camera backpack but I had no idea that it was that tiny! The photo makes us think it is bigger but it is really tiny! It fits just a small camera such us Canon XTi (no batery grip), one extra small lens such as Tamron 17-50mm, and some memories or bateries - THAT IS ALL - The thing that really bothered me most is that it is too narrow, shallow, and tight. It is really impossible to fit all that gear showed in the photo they use for the commercial. DO NOT BUY IT! IT DOES NOT WORTH!"
2,way too small,The picture tends to make the product look larger than it is. When I recieved the product I had to decide if I would keep it or not. I kept it and use it for short trips but it doesn't hold much.
2,An Unreliable Protection of the Expensive Equipment,i bought this bag first becasue of it's compact size. After using it I found a serious problem that the zippers can slide open when they are not completely closed. I dropped my Canon 35-350mm USM L lens twice becasue of the zipper. It wouldbe nice to have another strap outside the bag to prevent the flap opening too wide.
1,A HASSLE to open quickly,"Ok this bag is small, I knew that before I bought it. But what I didn't know what that the bag has a piece of material about an inch over the zipper that makes it difficult to open the bag quickly. It is irritating, I wish I never bought this bag for my camera. I went back to my old camera bag."
2,A Grimoire of Shadows,"This Book to me is more like a recipe book of Spells. Not much in the way of cause, purpose or reason. Whether or not the spells actually work, I cannot say but I feel it could have used a little more detail."
1,Blah and Boring!,Why is it that some authors feel that in order for their book to be taken seriously it must be boring. I am so sick of books written about witchcraft with no flair. If I were you I would pass on this one. I sure wish I had!
4,Lots of good exercises listed,"If any one can fully complete any of the exercises in this book, they will surely be a witch worthy of their own following."
3,Good Book but.,This is not a bad book with some nice idea but the fact on page 17 is bs I am offended by the idea that most young and cute is high priestess and priest which make no sense look as nothing to do with magickal skill i think if reader just ingore some sections and esp page 17 I was int in garderian tradtion and that section had nothing to do with it. But rest is correct not best book on the craft nor the worst i just think more effort and trying to keep sexism out of a book is good idea His Magical Rites of the Crystal Well book is must read but i would pass on this one and go for Magical Rites of the Crystal WellBlessed Be;
3,Alright,"This was my first book on magick, something about the cover just grabed me i think. Anyway years later i read initiation into hermetics...imagine my surprise when i found the exercises from IIH distilled and watered down then placed in this book with rituals and wiccan inspired art. It is a fact Fitch has worked on IIH and DID water it's technuiqes down to make a outer court manual. Save your time if you are TRULY interested in doing magick go see Initiation into Hermetics. Get to step five and you'll be one amazing witch...get to step 10 and that goddess invokation will not end at the end of the ritual...you will stay changed and one with divinity. Your choice....they do have some nice artwork in Grimoire of Shadows."
2,Dreamy Introduction,This book is good for someone who want a very shallow summary introduction to witch craft but no for any serious practitioner. Before buying any book for the craft research the author very well to make sure his practices are in line with what you want to become as a practitioner.
5,You Don't Have to Have Been Raised Catholic in Chicago to Enjoy ... But It Helps!,"My Angel's Name Is Fred will capture and hold your fancy and fill you with the awe and wonder of growing up. The stories are forthrightly and unapologetically nostalgic -- a nostalgia everyone who's grown up Catholic can share in. Byrne's humor and masterful storytelling will be enjoyed by all. Vivacious, sensitive, and wise, this is a book you'll want to read again and again."
4,A MUST for Irish Catholics!,"This book will make you laugh, and bring back memories of nuns, priests, & ""the parish"". The author is brilliant in his descriptions. A fun book!"
5,The best cover for patches in the water,"I have osteoarthritis and use a pain patch. I also am involved in a water class for people with arthritis and everytime I would go in the water for any length of time my patch would come off. I am allergic to tape and this was just what I needed to keep my patch from falling off in the water. It doesn't leave a mark on me and it keeps the patch secure.They are the best, and hard to find in drug stores."
4,durable dog toy,"These dog toys are great. We have a terrier mix that can have the squeeker and stuffing out of a toy in less than 1 minute. Perhaps in a doggy toy destroy contest this would be a could quality, but most times its not! That is why I love these toys. Our dog doesnt destroy them. They are durable and he loves the crackle noise it makes. I have to admit though, the squeeker noise is gone (that is why I gave it 4 stars), but the crackle keeps on going."
3,Good but not great...,My husband LOVES marzipan so I bought this for him. This candy is good but it's not great.
1,trunk restoration book review,"The book was very poorly constructed and lacking in what it seemed to promise by its title. Although I am an experienced wood worker, I have never restored a antique trunk until now. The book was of little or no use. I could not recommend it as an appropriate manual.Harold Bonham"
4,reverent of God and His Church,I loved every page of the book. It was hard for me to put it down. I am hungry for every morsel of the Church and Fr Randolph fed it to me like a good shepherd. I have traveled a rocky road myself and thank God I found the Church. I want to show God all my love and reverence for His Son and this book has helped me do this. I want to enjoy all the treasures my Father has stored for me in the Mass and this book has done this. I want to teach my children everything about the Mass just as I have promised God and this book has helped me. As I read the words I sense the Love for Jesus in Fr Randolphs' pages. I want to give my all and this book tells you how. The faith is not a buffet where you take only what you want nor is it a democracy its the Kingdom of God and this book tells you why certain things are done and how the body and blood are to be treated. Worship Him!
4,Decent Basic Overview of Mass with Some Editorializing,"Fr. Randolph knows a fair bit of the history of the Mass. It is not a detailed historical treatment (as is The History And The Future Of The Roman Liturgy by Denis Crouan) and the editorializing noted in other reviews is given with appropriate caveats.Fr. Randolph's main goal, which I believe he accomplishes, is to show the broad outline of the Mass and review both those essential, core elements as well as the ""furniture"" and changeable styles of this and previous ages. This is a book in the spirit of traditional liturgical reform, for sure, but that is a sub-theme in this succint book. Our parish purchased it for a teen class on the Mass (which is why I ended up reading it). It will work for that with some knowledgable instructor exposition."
4,A very good effort,"4 1/2. Charlie Sepulveda, Puerto Rican trumpet and flugel horn player, has released a really fine album of Latin Jazz. One of the things that makes it stand out is the fine compositions, three of which are by that excellent composer and pianist, Hilton Ruiz, one of the artists that introduced me to Latin Jazz.Another thing is the uniformly high musicianship by the band members (none of whom I'm familiar with). I especially like Ismael Rodrigues who plays hard-bop and other jazz stylings as easily as more Latin-derived piano and Ricardo Pons on various saxes.A couple numbers (the title cut and ""Just for You,"" both written by Sepulveda himself) are a little on the slick side, skating a tad too near to jazz lite for me (hence the half-star off), but they're very well performed and don't really detract. Plus, the leader has a pretty killer muted solo on ""Just for You"" that keeps it squarely in a true jazz mode.Not essential, but, all in all, very listenable and enjoyable."
1,"Not the Battle of Thermopylae, by Steven Pressfield","I purchase this book by mistake, thinking it was the version by Steven Pressfield. Wrong! I was not impressed with this version of ""Gates of Fire"". In fact it often left me with a sour taste in my mouth. It is not entertainment and it definately has nothing to teach me."
5,Thoroughly Enjoyable,"I have been in awe of Buddy Rich's musicianship since hearing him live at ""Lennie's on the Turnpike"" in MA back in the sixties. He could 'suggest' a melody during his solo's better than any drummer I've ever heard (in 62 years). Mel Torme's biography is just fine at portraying Buddy Rich.Read it and judge for yourselves!"
3,"A great story, but....","A great story, but.... The Buddy Rich story had to be told, and on the whole Tormé does it with honesty and humour. His writing, however, suffers from a number of bad mixed metaphors, and there is a dreadful editing mistake when the lead in quote to one of the final chapters is dated as being at Rich's birthday party in 1988. He died in 1987. These qualms aside, the book is easy reading, with many funny anecdotes. The view of the jazz scene is predictably white and cronyish, but the main interest is Rich's extraordinary life and talent."
4,different color,"i give it four stars, because the color is different from it shown. It's not that bring but it's a comfortable sheet. If let me give this a name of color i will say it's chocolate color. But i still satisfied with what i bought. And the price is affordable.good buy"
3,Street signs and other signs are shown to help with reading.,"This book deals with street signs, advertisements, flyers, etc. **It has nothing to do with manual communication**"
1,Known Problem with Fujifilm Cameras,"I think I used this camera 5 times and the LCD screen cracked. There is no physical damage to the camera and it still looks brand new. When I called customer service they knew it was a problem because the CSR gave me a story of how he try to crack the LCD screen on a Fujifilm camera on his own. He succeed, and there was no physical damage to the LCD screen on the outside but the screen on the inside was cracked. On the whole, I think Fujifilm Camera Screens break very easily. They have to cut cost some where and they just used a cheap LCD screen. Don't buy any of their cameras stick with Canon or Nikon.Cosmicac"
3,FinePix F45fd,I took the recommendation of a lady at a photo shop trying to sell the camera. I have been unhappy with it because I am always getting red eye on my people photos. The reason I bought it was to take photos of my 7 kids. Now I regret not having done more research.
2,Not So Great...,"i am a huge fan of EA-Sports....but i am sad to say that with NHL 2000, they lost some points. the gameplay is too fast...out of control fast....the odd man rushes are way out of proportion with real life....and scoring is pretty much impossible. don't get me wrong you can score, but it doesn't feel like you earned it. if you get lucky on a rebound you can get a goal. other than that, don't count on it. trades are almost impossible.....this game is just not good. the best NHL in the series is still NHL 98. i am looking forward to Playstation 2...hopefully EA Sports will get the NHL series back where it belongs. if you still go out and buy this game after my fair warning, good luck, and i hope my words of ""i told you so"" echo throughout your head...."
2,nhl isnt good (i am not giving you any money),"This game wasn't as good as expected. The gameplay is the same as last years. The dynasty mode isn't that good. It is difficult to get the other teams to accept fair trades. They even turned down a Joe Sakic to them for Kyle Mclaren and Landon Wilson. The drafted players are crazy. The free agency option isn't that good as only one or two players at most will sign. Usually they will say that they won't sign with your team. On the positive, it is easier to score goals and it is about hockey. That is all!"
2,What a let down,"After the great job EA sports did with creating NHL 99, NHL 2000 is a complete let down. The graphics are worse and the game play is too fast to seem realistic. I wish I hadn't bought this product and just held on to my NHL 99."
3,Definitely needs improvment!,"Okay, this is the first hockey game I got for PSX. It looked cool, until I started playing a lot. There are major problems! One, you rarely can score on the breakaways. Along with that, there are at least 20 in a game! The defense is horrible! The computer gets way too many shots. I don't know, but I think EA could have done a lot better."
1,JUST SUCKS COMPARED TO '99,"NHL 2000 is just too easy, even on all-star level on 5 min periods you could score about 10 goals in the game. you got to try harder not to score than to score. I hate the fact you can only choose one team for the season. NHL 99 is 1,000 times better than this one. EA sports have progressivelly gotten worse with their hockey games. '97 better than '98 which is better than '99...graphics are pretty good though and I liked the draft at the end of season but the made up player names are pretty stupid. overall it gets boring very quickly."
1,THE GREAT 1 SAYS WHY?,"WHY? WHY ON EARTH DID THE IDIOTS AT EA MAKE YOU PLAY A 20 MINUTE PERIOD GAME FOR ACCURATE GOALTENDER STATS. THE SCORING IS OUT OF HAND, THE BIG CHECK IS ABSOLUTELY RETARDED, AND THE GRAPHICS JUST PLAIN STINK. GET FACEOFF 2K FOR THE BEST HOCKEY OF THE NEW MILLENIUM."
3,Not as good as previous versions,"I have been addicted to NHL 1998 since the day I bought it...I loved how the game flowed, how it was relatively easy to devise both offensive and defensive strategies, and the excellent play by play commentary. NHL 2000 is a complete change...the action goes too fast and has an arcade feel...instead of developing strategy, youre simply trying to react as quickly as you can. I like to play defensively but I am a little put off by the fact that the computer can (and has) completed several passes and scored in the span of just tenths of a second, leaving no response time. On the other end, it does seem easier to score...many strange bad angle shots have ended up in the net, as well as shots from the other end of the ice. The bottom line for me is that NHL 2000 seems to have taken a fair amount of control of the game from the player and given it to the ""computer"", and I just don't think the game is nearly as much fun."
4,Nice,"Nice game, classic in its own way. Personally, NHL '98 was the best hockey game for Playstation, but I decided to get this one too. Good price and fast shipping."
3,It was all right...,"...this didn't run as smoothly as NHL '99 did. The game was just way too fast. You could skate from one end of the rink to the other in about three seconds. The puck's size increased muchly from the last game, and I actually liked the authentic puck size in NHL '99.The good thing is now it's easier to do slapshots, where as in '99, your main shots were wristers, and instead of winding up to take a slapshot, you had to wind up to release a wrist shot. No biggie.EA Sports has honestly made better games, and I hope that NHL 2001 is a little bit better."
2,"Bring back ""All Games"" mode","While I enjoyed NHL99 and looked forward to 2000, it was very disappointing. My number one complaint (and EASports seems to do this a lot) is that they took a great feature away. In 99 and previous versions, you could play any game at any point in the season. You weren't forced to pick one team and stay with it all season. But in 2000, they take this away and you only can choose 1 team. Seems very limiting for those of us that enjoy variety!"
4,SFBT for domestic violence,"It was very helpful for writing my papaer for my SW graduate class, plus the subject matter. I have helped co-led 1 of these groups (clinical), can get very stressful at times. I really don't like the facilitator/participant dialogue, cause i'm very good at that part with my clients."
4,Dancin' down the highway,"I first heard this album in 1977 and loved it then. I played it so much that I wore out the casette tape. It wasn't until 1998 that I finally found the old tape and found an old friend. the music still has a 70's feel to it but Nils sure could make a stratocaster talk. This record will make you feel good and you can play great air guitar in the car. Check out code of the road, the guitar is very sweet."
2,Weakest Solo Album Of Nils Lofgren's Career,"""I Came To Dance"" was Nils Lofgren's third solo album, and coming at a critical point in his career, he unfortunately delivered the weakest album he has ever made. At the time, many regarded him as a rising star, but ""I Came To Dance"" probably killed his career momentum and relegated him to the cult status he has languished in ever since. Nonetheless, there are a few worthy songs. The title track is a fun statement of purpose which became a concert highlight for many years. ""To Be A Dreamer"" and ""Code Of The Road"" are fine songs, but most of the rest is entirely forgettable. For the most part the better songs from this album can be found on other compilations or live albums, so don't bother with this one unless you need to have everything."
2,Bakshi's worse,"This is the worst Bakshi film next to Cool World. The premise is good idea of 50's greaser gangs but it fails to capture the raw black humor of Fritz The Cat and the bleak urban settings of Heavy Traffic. This one is just boring and stupid , and not very interesting. It does however have some good qualities ..the animation and imagry is alot better mostly because it wasn't rotoscoped but other than that it's not that great...."
3,Hey Don't Buy It!,"Now, I liked this movie. I watched it religiously while I was in college and really it's not that good in the vein of Bakshi films though it's better than Street Fight which actually made me nauseated but besides the novelty of cussing, perverted toons it's not that spectacular of a film. Me and my college buddies would go around campus quoting the characters from movie like Vinny, Crazy Shapiro and that lady that moons this black dude from the passenger seat window of her boyfriends car. Get this movie if you're into collecting wierd cinema. Otherwise stay far away from it."
5,Its like two watches for the price of one!,"When I first got this watch, I thought it would be something I wouldnt wear (I generally have bad luck when I buy jewlery related items online). However, I was surprise, the brown leather strap is nice and thick for a cool and trendy look, and you can just as quickly change the face and move it onto the steel strap for a more elagant look. If i lost this watch, I would purchase it again. The copper face looks more blackish in certain lighting, for a cool black metal look.Cons: The instruction book didnt tell me how to adjust the bracelet strap legnth, you basically need to push out the pins in the direction the arrows face. But I figured this out by looking online at other similar watches.Good watch, you wont be dissapointed."
5,Always gets compliments,I got this watch for my boyfriend because he has brown shoes that he LOVES but couldn't find a watch that he liked that went with them. I bought him this one for his birthday and right off the box he LOVED it! the leather strap is very attractive and he ALWAYS gets compliments from it :) the fact that it has different straps are easy to change so he can easily go from casual to a more elegant look in seconds! really recommend :D
4,anyone for a ride,This is a campy killer.The dude picks up hitchhikers (babes of course) and teaches them a lesson of their life. It has some excitment and suspense that are very spooky. I personally liked the movie and makes me and my wife a special event every time we go camping. Take a look if you can find it well worth it.Lenzi is a far out and off the wall director that has done some pretty scary stuff.
4,Too big for a small camera,"I bought this when I purchased my Olympus D510. Reviewers ""recommended"" this bag for the camera - but it is WAY TOO BIG! Very well made if you have a larger camera tho. I'm mostly annoyed that it was rec'd for the small Olympus, and that their description didn't say the size (4.5x7.5x3.2 thick) which would have given it away."
4,very snug fit for Olympus 3020,"I have an Olympus 3020, and this bag fits ""just right."" I can get the camera in, a battery charger, and an extra memory card. That's all that fits perfectly, though. The USB cable doesn't fit in.If you want a bag for a smaller camera, this is great. The clips on the strap are solid metal, and the inside compartment is useful in that it has places for batteries and memory cards. If you get anything bigger than a traditional point-and-shoot, though, you should look a little harder for a better suited bag."
5,Nice bag,"I bought this bag to hold a fairly small camera (Olympus D-490). The camera fits easily in the bag. I'm not sure that a larger, SLR-like camera, would fit so well. The inside is padded, so as to not scratch the monitor on back. There is a small, separate pouch for batteries, memory cards, etc. The main pouch has a zip-top cover, as well as a second, fold-over flap for extra protection. I'm pleased with the bag."
5,Love It!,"I love this bag! It hold my camera, extra battery, memory cards and even a mini tripod I have to take family photos. It fit on a belt loop so my husband can carry it without feeling silly and I can carry it like a purse. Its just big enough to carry what you need without feeling like you're carring around a photo center. We took it on our month long honeymoon last year and it still looks like new."
1,Not for Olympus Cameras,This was the suggested bag for the Olympus 750 I just purchased. I don't know why because the camera doesn't fit in the bag. You can squish it in if you take the strap off but it's tight. The Tamrac model #600R works much better but Amazon does not carry this one as far as I can tell.
4,"Great compressor, okay gun","I just received this kit a few days ago. Used it quite a bit yesterday. First, the compressor is really nice. Very quiet! Light and compact too. I was shocked. Compared to my twin stack compressor, this is just a whisper. It keeps up fine with the brad nailer and a stapler I was using. I was working pretty fast too. I wouldn't run my framer with it, but that's not its purpose. I am very impressed!Now to the nailer. It is a good nailer, but falls short on one thing. The nose piece is too wide, making it impossible to sink a nail when toe nailing. I'm planning on filing mine down to more of a point. Seems to sink nails otherwise, though.If I could seperate, I would give the compressor 5 stars and the nailer 3."
4,Good little unit,Works great for small jobs. The gun was advertised to include a case but does not. I had to call the manufacture to get one.
2,very unhappy with compressor,"The listing was very misleading about the compressor which hardly has enough capacity to operate the gun, tell it like it is and i would have purchased a bigger unit. Very disappointed with Amazon."
1,Disposable Compressor!!!!!!!!!!!,"Hi I got this thing and it was great except that it broke! I called today and since it has been past 90 days, it is not under warranty. Amazon will not take it back because it is classified as disposable."
4,Another great one,"For all of you Mr. & Mrs. North fans, this one is another winner. You can see some refinement in production values & a glimpse of some future TV character actors."
1,"A Glorified Magazine, very dissapointing","This ""book"" is basically a 80-page magazine, with lots of irrelevant pitcures to take up space. There is a lot of general talk about starting a gym, but no statistics of any kind, no surveys, no hard-facts backed up by studies, no examples of business plans, obtaining financing, examples of successful gym cash flow statements, etc. More or less, this is of the quality of a high-school term paper. I was very dissapointed, and I've returned it back to Amazon."
3,Really too basic,"If you are buying this kind of book and are serious about investing some money, this is not the book for you. It is too light and is very shallow. Nothing is wrong with the book, but there is not much too it.I suspect it is being marketed at the same people who buy fitness magazines. That is fine, I buy them too, but if you are really going to put some serious cash into a business, get more serious than this."
3,Pump it Up in the King's English!!,"A good starter, and one of few books about the gym business. But the book deserves a rewrite in American English. Some of the English spelling and idioms are distracting."
4,Weiss kreuz,"The dubbing is horrible, and the subbing is so-so.. the animation is not that great either. But that wasn't the point of this 24 episode anime. Mostly it was for the voice actors. I already have all of the DVDs and I'm waiting for someone to bring the OVA movie to the USA along with the manga. Recommended for those who like sappy, angsty, bishie drama."
3,UnReal Programmer disappointed,"What dissapointed me was the title compared to the contents. I was expecting lots of good code, explanations, and tips from someone who had found a lot of the gothcas that come about from writing code with these new XML parsers and stylesheets. There is almost no code until page 178, and even this code uses IBM's xml4j and the TX methods, which are very outdated. SAX is barely mentioned until chapter 8, pg 424 of a 449 pg book. The Author spends a lot of time on this ""XML website"" development, but I don't feel the pages were well spent. Not much code and not a real production level design IMHO. The ""Java and XML"" O'Reilly book is more of a programmers book. For XSLT, I like ""XSLT Programmer's Reference"" from Wrox."
2,Extended Markup Language?,"The first sentence almost made me close the book to never reopen it again. ""Extended"" Markup Language? When writing a book about XML, its a good idea to know what the acronym stands for!"
1,"Beware, Company out of business?","BEWARE! to any purchaser of a Paulin Propane Product, There is no after purchase support for warranty or replacement parts. Their website is shut down and their phones are disconnected. Can't recommend a purchase of this or other Paulin Propane Products."
5,The Timeless and Tragic Beauty of X Japan,"The legendary JRock band X Japan was always known as a metal band, but they were also known for their incredible and enthralling ballads as well. This album collects all of their ballads, from their 1988 debut album's ""Alive"", to their final goodbye ballad, ""The Last Song"". All the way through, your senses will be overwhelmed by the indescribable beauty of these classics, such as ""Endless Rain"", one of their most well known and popular songs, or ""Forever Love"", which has to be one of the most utterly stunning and beautiful ballads in history. Each track was written and composed by Yoshiki, the drummer/pianist and leader of the band, and his incredible talent for composition and songwriting shines on this CD. If your looking for something more than just ""another cd"", then please try X Japan's ""Ballad Collection"", and enter a world of tragic beauty the likes of which you've never heard before."
4,Used in HS science class,"I used this film to compliment my classroom studies on the topic of stem cells this year. The mix of scientific, social, and political issues made the topic more enjoyable for the students. I also really liked that the patients/characters were female. It was interesting to see their strength and struggles through their hardships in life. If you are a teacher, consider using this in your science classroom."
5,State of the art Bluegrass Flatpicking,"For the past thirty years Tony Rice has been acknowledged as the towering figure in the field of bluegrass guitar. This album features the flatpicking instrumentals that developed that stellar reputation. Tony is a master of speed, taste, and tone. Along with Tony, the album features a who's who of the top bluegrass instrumentalists providing backup and sharing solos. This collection is outstanding and easily rates five stars."
1,Wish I Would Have Rented it First!,"I'm an amateur motocross racer, and a big fan of the sport, and I was terribly disappointed with this game. The only thing that I did like was the play-by-play announcing by Art Eckman and David Bailey, that was pretty cool. However, the graphics are poor, the game runs incredibly slow, and there are serious problems with corners. I have never seen any pro (or amateur) rider take corners that slowly. There's also a glitch that if you lean over too far in turns, your bike will not move! I'm not sure if the graphics people have seen a race since 1980, because all the bikes have huge 80's style handlebars, and you would never see a pro rider racing with his elbows at his sides! Shame on EA Sports!"
1,Bummer,"I was super excited to finally get this game today. After playing Motocross Madness on the PC for the last 18 months I can tell you that EA has not done their homework. The graphics are rather cheesy and the sound is horrible. Bikes are difficult to control, etc. They did a great job with marketing and packaging but the game really bites. I want my money back...."
2,Wow.... what happened???? :(,"Not a great CD... Yes, it's dark and very after hours, but the track selection is weird, there is a distinct absence of strong vocals, and the monotony of the CD is overwhelming. ""Resonate"" was a great CD, but ""Evolve"" just does not deliver."
2,Doesn't taste the same,"I've been making lots of dirty martinis lately,so I thought I would try out olive juice brine since I go through olive juice in the jar very quickly. I wasn't impressed with the product,not only did it not taste very good,but it also used more than expected,so the bottle wouldn't have lasted long. I also purchased the Dirty Sue martini mix,I haven't tried that one yet. If you like the taste of a dirty martini you would drink if ordered at a nice bar/restaurant then this product would not be satisfying."
4,Confused of the ending,"After watching the final volume of this series, I've been quite confused whether the ending is supposedly ""happy"" or ""sad""? Also I agree with the previous 2 reviewers as that the work seemed to be done rushing or with animator's tight scgedule. The end of the story line doesn't seem to answer more further details about the main characters. However, the whole series is enjoyable and worth keeping as a collection!"
3,Small,They are well made but they are small.Dont cover much i can still see my car mats.i bought these for my jeep and not happy with the size.
4,"Nice floor mats, good for the money.","I bought this because I needed something to help keep my car clean in the winter. I own a Honda CR-V and the ""legitimate"" products were just too expensive. I was worried a bit about the other reviews saying this product smelled horribly of rubber, but the product I got did not smell bad. Of course, it did smell like rubber when I lifted it up close to my face but it didn't reek so you can smell it from under your feet or anything. I also only had to cut out a small portion from one of the mats to make it fit my car, so that was a plus. It's not super thick or super heavy but weighted and has textured surface so that it won't fly around in your car.Yeah, it's not something flash or something you feel real luxurious to have around, but all in all this seems to be worth my money."
2,Inferior quality,"Yes they stink, yes they're fairly cheap. Not worth it unfortunately. You can buy superior ones at BJs/Costco for cheaper that are much better. The biggest complaint from me is they slide! They're also fairly shallow (read: not good water retainage).Buy another type!"
3,rubber mats,Well the box it came in was way too big but for the price the rugs were not bad there wasn't any strong odor of rubber ....the mats were generic and could be cut. Perfect protection from salt and any dirt.
4,floor mats,"great mats, but need to wash with vinegar and set in sun for a few days to get rid of the oil smell. WORTH IT"
5,Love these!,"I can't believe I waited so long to get these, they totally rock. Keep my mats nice and clean just take em out and hose them off every once in a while."
3,Fine,There is nothing special about these floor mats. There is nothing bad about them either. They do smell but I left them outside for a week before putting them in the car and haven't had a problem. I was a little disappointed when I was at Costco and saw similar mats that were less expensive. That is my fault for not bothering to shop around.
4,its probably good for older smaller cars.,I think its good for being universal mats. I bought it for my 2012 camry but i realize that the camry is wider than most cars. There is like an inch of space that the mat does not cover. Its good for its price but i still have to find extra materials to cover the other inch. Compared to my last mats it has better gripping. It only moved just a little but pretty much stayed where i placed it. im happy with my purchase since it was speedy and cheaper than most mats
5,Its a steal,"It dosen't smell, fits nicely in my infiniti and does what its suppose to do, stop dirt :)I don't know how you can go wrong with this.BTW mats are not light so they don't slip at all"
2,Doesn't fit a BMW 328i,"This product claims to fit in a 2010 BMW 328i sedan, but it does not. Even after managing to wrestle it out of the annoying packaging it comes with, and trimming the driver's side floor mat as much as possible, it was still too wide at the top to fit between the pedals. I returned it and bought the mats directly from BMW, which fit perfectly."
2,not a good fit!,"I bought these mats for my 2011 Prius (came up when searching for winter mats for this car make and model) Fit is not good and mats move around considerably. Also, mats don't have the functionality to be held in place by existing clips on car floor. Overall, it was a disappointing purchase."
1,JUNK!,"I should have trusted other reviewers who warned about the quality of these floor mats. They custom fit nicely, but aren't thick enough to hold themselves in place. They are constantly sliding and bunching up as you enter and exit the vehicle. Very thin."
2,Horrible Smell,They look fine and do their job but they smell horrible. I even let them sit outside for a month to air out but they still have a very potent chemical smell.
4,Great mats,"These are some decent floor mats for the price I paid. They do smell a little but nothing major and the smell is gone within a few days, again, nothing major. I've smelled much worse. Aside from this they are decent, just gotta keep em clean."
1,what a headache,"These mats look decent, but made the interior of my new car smell like we had a fuel leak, almost to the point of nausea. I had the entire fuel system checked out before just pulling the mats out of the truck and taking a smell."
5,Can't go wrong...,These mats fit great and are heavy enough so that they dont move around... but did smell for about a week or two.
4,Easy to trim,I bought these mats for my Jeep Liberty and they were not close to the size of the Jeep mats. But the mats are designed to be easy to work with and they trimmed down easily for a perfect fit. The rubber smell was not as bad as others have mentioned - did not bother me.
4,Good looking utilitarian mats,"These mats are simple, strong and easily cleanable. Perform well for the kind of product they are meant to be. Only real downside is that the underside is smooth so they do slide around a little over time."
5,Great Mats for the Northeast Winters,This is the third set of mats purchased (3 cars). Great for protecting the carpeting from the salt and snow of winter.
2,"Wow, do they STINK","I cant get the smell out of my car. The first time we put them in it was hot so when we opened the door we about fell over. So I decided to air them out and wash them with some soap for a day. Ok, put them back in, still smell like burnt rubber, they work fine, how could they not? But the smell is overwhelming. I have washed them three times, still stink."
5,Good for price!,Fit very well and mede well for my truck. Keeps my carpets from looking the worst during this rainy season.
1,They still smell after 4 weeks!,"Read the reviews and put these outside when they arrived Jan 30 so the smell could dissipate. After 4 weeks of being outside, I put them in the car last night. This morning, I took them back out because the car reeked of the chemical smell!It may be important to note that I am very sensitive to chemical smells after working with solvents for a couple of years as a teenager. As an example, the tiny traces in chemically decaffeinated coffee will give me an upset stomach for days and keep me awake much longer then regular coffee. (The more commonly available water decaffeinated coffee gives me no trouble at all). So if your sensitive to petrochemical smells, I would avoid these floor mats."
4,Great as soon as the smell is gone...,"These are good quality floor mats, they aren't too thick or too thin and only needed a little trimming to fit under the pedals on my 08 Civic coupe. Just make sure you leave the windows cracked on a couple of sunny days to let the rubber smell diffuse. I had a 1 week old air freshener in my car (That last's about 2 months) and as soon as I put the mats in all you could smell was rubber. I thought people were exaggerating but it's pretty intense, I left my windows cracked and my sun roof slanted for about a week and it went away though."
3,Just Okay,"I have a 2011 Hyundai Santa Fe. I understand this is a universal floor mat, but I think it's designed more so for sedans or something smaller. It just doesn't fit my SUV's front floor all that well. There's a lot of space on the sides, usually where the sedan's trunk or gas tank release would be. That's why I feel like they're not meant for SUV's. You will definitely have to adjust and cut to your cars fit.I did not have that smelly problem some people have stated. Just in case, I aired my floor mats out in the garage for a night before I threw them inside. It seemed to help because I was nauseated by any overwhelming scent.These floor mats pretty much do what they're supposed to. I saw cheaper option at my local Costco and would actually have rather purchased those.Overall pretty satisfied because I didn't spend that much. Just wish they fit better."
3,beaten and dragged...,"This is a really strange record, and not easy to listen to. While I can respect that, I also can't give it more than 3 stars. ""Dead and Drugged"" is a fabulous song, and the only reason I hang onto this CD. I love Karla Schickle's voice, but I much prefer her work in Ida than with Beekeeper. The angular, almost always minor key guitar playing throughout is original but tiring and eventually grating. Obviously some people are going to get into this more than I do, but if you're checking it out due to the Ida connection be warned that it is quite a bit different. I'd recommend ""Listening Cap"" by Liquorice (featuring Dan Littleton) for a nice Ida-related album. So: much respect to Beekeeper and their fans but it's just not my thing."
3,It is not my favorite music,I bought this record hoping that I will find some guitar-parts of Duane Allman. But I got wrong informations about it.
4,Review,"The French movies ""Jean De Florette"" and ""Manon of the spring"" are award winning films. The ""Jean De Florette"" is the first part in this story of a father, whom is hunch back, his wife, and daughter. Jean mother, Florette, dies and leaves him her farm. But the rural town doesn't take well to outsiders and when he runs into trouble. And when he runs they don't help, even though they could have. Manon of the spring is the story of Monon, the daughter of Jean who is now grows up into beautiful women. She is now a goat herder goes back to the town who took away what she loved most in the world. She will try to hurt the people who hurt her, and they will be hurt just not in the way she thinks. These movies are realist in the way that the good guy doesn't always win, but people get what is coming to them. The hardships people face in the movie has you crying and cheering for them. The landscape is wonderful and the acting was nicely done."
1,Don't buy this Korean version,"This double-feature is one of the best movies ever made and one of my all-time favorites, but **do not buy this Korean version**. Buy a set from another manufacturer. The Korean version I got has such faulty subtitles (completely missing for much of the conversation) that I threw it out and bought another copy elsewhere. Beware the Korean version."
4,Sad Story in Provence,"The copies I own are on VHS, so, I cannot vouch for the quality of this DVD. However, ""Jean de Florette"" is one of my favorite films because of the story line, the characters, the familiar French countryside and the sad irony. Other reviewers have had conflicting comments about the translation; my French friends have told me that I can't use this film to improve my use of the French language because it's not the French of current, common usage."
3,Convoluted story,"The scenery and acting was stunning and excellent, respectively. However, the story line was unnecessarily complex at times and strained my attention span."
3,What's with flimsy packaging of DVDs?,"The double feature DVD with both Jean de Florette and Manon des Sources, staples of French cinema, sounded quite attractive. I was not pleased, however, to receive the DVD in a case that is so flimsy that it's almost a disrespect to the films! MGM, World Films, or whoever the printer is, why cut corners on such works of art?If you would like to see a pic of this dvd cover go to a website by the name of riskening. After the name you write dot com. If insert the link Amazon takes it off. For the image you further type in /?p=689. Or, you can search for the blog post entitled, ""A further look at eco-box types... (aka the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly)"""
3,"Shipping fast, quality ?","I use this film for teaching French. The shipping from AMAZON services is quite good, but I find their shopping cart review lacking. The quality of the CD I received is only fair. Perhaps that has nothing to do with anything but the manufacturer."
5,great films,"A great pair of films which should be viewed as 2 parts of the whole. The DVD quality is quite good and at a very good price. There are no extras, but I don't feel I need them - the films speak for themselves. You must select the subtitles - each time I stopped the film I had to reset them - a minor bother. I was very glad to have them on DVD."
1,Jeanne de Florette & Manon of the Springs,"I saw these movies originally in the theater, loved both and ordered them because I wanted to have it in my collection. I ordered it twice and neither of the DVDs worked. I would think you would check your merchandise before sending it out. I am so disappointed and can't believe that you could send out two defective DVDs and had not solved the problem after the first one plus some of the complaints I have read in the reviews. I am rating this with one star because of the quality of the DVD, not the films.Colleen"
1,ULTRA LAME,"UTTER WASTE OF MONEY. I LOVE THESE TWO MOVIES. I HAVE SEEN BOTH SEVERAL TIMES. HOWEVER, THIS ""TWO FER"" VERSION IS THE WORST TRANSLATION I HAVE EVER SEEN. SENTENCES AREN'T COMPLETED, DIALOG SKIPPED, RENDERING THIS VERSION AN UNINTELLIGIBLE MESS. WHAT A RIP OFF!"
3,Jean de Flourette and Manon of the spring,These are wonderful films which I saw years ago in a theater but the English subtitles in these versions are sadly insufficient. They are much shorter than the ones I saw in a theater earlier. If I had not known the plot I sure wouldn't have been able to figure it out from the subtitles on this DVD.
4,Great French film.,How refreshing to have a movie that has believable characters in a greed story that's as old as the stories in the Bible. No car chases or shoot'um scenes that go on forever just good acting with English subtitles no less. Great!
5,Great!,"my favorite films ever! (it's one story.) great story, great acting, great cinematography, great everything. Daniel Auteuil's performance is the most amazing by a male actor i've ever seen. unless you're a stone, you will cry at the end.also interesting for the french accent of the region (assuming it's at least approximately correct)."
5,Magnificent,"These two movies combined are the most beautiful I have ever seen in every respect. Gerard Depardieu has long since established himself in many genres, but as the poor guy who takes all the hard knocks and keeps on getting back up again, he's as good as they get. Emanuelle Beart is absolutely gorgeous as (adult) Manon, the scenery of the Luberon is amazing, and when I was offered a chance to visit that area by friends in France I jumped at it purely based on the wonderful memories of this movie experience. I had been hoping to get a copy on dvd for as long as dvds have been an option and have had the book for many years now. I am a true fan of this very special story which surely could not be depicted any more beautifully than it is here."
5,wonderful movie,"I LOVE this movie. I was not chocked by the bright colors of this version - but then I knew about it before watching it. If you liked this movie you will also enjoy ""My father's glory"" (la gloire de mon père) and my mother's castle (le chteau de ma mère), from the same author Marcel Pagnol.I am not totally sure if it is still noticeable with the subtitles but the dialogues are very good, the story is rich and it takes place in the beautiful south of France. (same thing for my father's glory and my mother's castle).Very touching. I higly recommend it!!"
4,Two beautiful and moving films -- how could you possibly pass this up?,"This is a very exciting new package -- two delightful and compelling films that tell the tragic and moving story of the lovely Manon and her father. Each story can stand on its own -- I actually saw Manon of the Spring first -- but they belong together and Jean de Florette sets up the backstory of Manon. You have to wait for the conclusion of Manon, however, to understand fully the story of Jean de Florette.The performances are stunning, the stories are powerful, and I challenge anyone to be unmoved by the end of either film. I saw these two during my freshman year in college and was amazed and stunned, and after seeing them I couldn't get enough of foreign cinema, catching every new release at our local arthouse theater.If you haven't seen them, this release creates the perfect opportunity -- and they will be films you will want to return to and watch again and again, and will want to introduce to your family and friends."
3,Great Movie - horrid translations! Don't buy it.,So far just half way into the two parts. This is absolutely the worst job of translating that I have seen done to a movie in many years! Questions are posed - but not answered. Then a reaction to the answer. Yes you can get the gist of it but someone was paid to do a horrid piece of work and it should be recalled and done competently. Then the movie will actually be great as it should be.
1,Bad priting,"I received this book with black and white printing inside. All the B&W photos are blurred. It does not look like the original book, more like a pirated book! Cannot believe I bought it through Amazon!"
3,Ok - but consider getting something bigger.,"This bag will likely hold 1 camera body, and two lenses - with a couple of other misc. If that second lense is a large zoom lense, consider purchasing something else.Also - think about different colors. I purchased this before I noticed that [someone else] was offering the identical model in black for cheaper.The backpack is comfortable to wear enough, but that front mesh pouch that is depicted holds next to nothing. The internal velcro compartments are awkward to use if the backpack is packed too tightly."
4,"Great build, but real small","I bought this for my Canon Digital Rebel and three lenses. By the time I put everything in, the bag was jam packed. I absolutly love the bag, and did not return it as all of my son's equipment fit in with some room to spare. If you are thinking about purchasing this, just double check to make sure your stuff will all, fit. If you think it will all fit you will not be disappointed."
5,packed to travel,"I own several Tamarac camera related bags and holders, and they have yet to disappoint me. This backpack is compact and easier to lug around than a full blown camera bag. Perfect for that short trip and still take enough to get the job done. Outstanding product"
4,Tiny but Mighty!,"If you are looking for a bag to fit your laptop, or a change of clothes, as well as your DSLR /SLR, keep looking. Crumpler bags might better serve your purpose. This little bag snugly fits my Nikon D80 with a mounted 70-200mm with lens hood, a 12-24mm lens, an extra battery, a few extra memory cards, a monopod (strapped to the exterior) and little else. It is however, well constructed, attractive, and offers good camera protection. If, like myself, you are a person who prefers to pack light when it comes to your gear, this little bags offeres a great way to tote your camera at a very affordable price. You will not be dissapointed."
3,stick with the original version,"I got this as my old copy was lost, and it was a great disappointment: about 25% of the text was abridged away, stripping a lot of nuance and story from it while adding many many more images. Thus, it is a kind of dumbed down version of the original, which was hands down the best one-volume account that I know of.You can still get a lot out of this book, of course, but it simply isn't the same kind of reading experience that the original, far more dense version was. Indeed, the original was such a masterpiece that I did not think a word of it could be changed without diminishment. Well, here is diminishment."
5,Comfort in Style!,"Simple, stylish, and very comfortable. With plantar fascitis, I have to be very careful about the shoes I wear. I found these very supportive with good cushioning in the heel area."
3,It's in Widescreen...which is bad,"This another great season of Law & Order. I love the show, the episodes, and the characters. The one downside is that this DVD is in widescreen. One of the previous reviewers said that Law & Order has aired in widescreen for years, which is false. It has only been aired that way since January 2006 (the same is true for Criminal Intent and SVU). These episodes, while shot in widescreen, were intended for full frame. Because of that there is a lot of dead space on both sides of the screen in a lot of shots. I still love the show and recommend the DVDs but hope that the studio redoes them in full frame and keeps the DVDs for the Law & Order series in full frame until they get to the 2005-2006 seasons."
5,Excellent in widescreen,"I've just seen all the episodes on disc one. It appears that the series was actually shot in widescreen. I was surprised because I didn't think any shows were shot that way in 1994-95. This is what I consider forward thinking. As a photographer I can tell you that the cinematography is spot on. The entirety of the wide field is used 90% of the time. Actors are placed all the way on the left and right of the screen in many scenes. The widescreen imagery gives great ambiance to the stories. In addition, the picture seems to have been mastered in high definition. The images are nice and sharp. Since the series was shot on film there is some grain present; however, the grain does not detract from enjoyment at all. This is a top notch presentation by Universal. Bring on season six with Benjamine Bratt!"
5,"Law & Order, The Fifth Season",Law & Order - The Fifth Year (1994-1995 Season)Perfect gift. Low price. Arrived quickly and just as described.
4,excellent series,"In this series allready several very good installments have been broadcast . Fortunately ,now the fifth series has been published let's hope that universal will publish further installments quicker"
5,"imaginative, jazzy MPB","This instrumental album shimmers with textures and ideas. I was drawn to this project after loving his arrangements on Caetano's Livro album, and this one doesn't disappoint. It is sophisticated and jazzy in its arrangements, benefits from the ornate pulses that bless so much Brazilian pop, and my main criticism is that I wish it were longer.All original tunes by Luiz Brasil except one, a fantastic rearrangement of Noite Perpetua."
4,These are half inch twist-ties.,"I doubt anyone thinks these are actually ""12in"" as labeled at the time of this review but it would be better if labeled as 0.5 inch to avoid confusion. The middle of the three sizes available, these twists are the ones I use most often to organize the many wires & cables of modern life."
3,He was funny - always played on the lyrics of his songs,"If it ain't one thing, it's another. RIP, Richard."
5,"Spy thriler, very good.",I will recommend this product because it is a spy thiriler. Met all my expectatios and more. It is good to the end.
5,Awesome movie,"Terrific story line and excellent acting. I was also extremely impressed with the director's portrayal of Kolkata, he really captured the city in beautiful way."
1,Warning!,As far as I know this version of the Blu Ray has a permanent watermark marring the picture from start to finish. Watermarks are not acceptable on a high quality product. They don't stop piracy and annoy the hell out of the paying customers who want to see the film and nothing else. This watermark business has to stop.
3,great conversation piece,"i heard about this book on a christian radio show and decided to get it to open a dialogue between me and my young teen daughter. the book is very dated, but addresses the most important issues. i like the book because it gives just enough details without overwhelming the young reader and yet, uses a simple language for young readers."
1,Poor excuse for lack of parental interaction,"This book was terribly troubling. My parents gave me this book instead of having a conversation about sex with me. If anything it trivializes the possibility of getting pregnant, comparing it to ice cream. Are you kidding me?!!! What happens if you eat too much ice-cream? You get an upset stomach, maybe gain some weight. If you get pregnant, there is a bit more to it! Thankfully, as an adult, I found a church that talked to the children about the joys and consequences of sex; starting in 6th grade. They also have guides for parents to speak to their kids along with the 12 week program. If you're throwing a book at a kid hoping it will keep them from having sex, you've probably missed the boat on involved parenting. I found nothing appealing about this book, except the delicious bowl of ice cream on the front."
5,This book is terrific!,"I read this book when I was in the 6th grade. I'm now a junior in high school and it is now that everything this book said has meaning. I think that maybe some of the book's content was over my head and under my feet, but now everything comes into perspective. I suggest that any girl having problems with faith or feelings should read this."
4,"Nice bag, smaller than expected","Tamrac makes a great camera case, and this one was no exception. Sturdy and well-made. It was advertized as being the right fit for my Fujifilm S-9000, but it is actually a bit too small for this camera. By the time I got the camera pushed in, the surrounding pouches were squeezed so tight little else would go in. I should have gone with a bigger case."
3,A little to small for Olympus C-2100,"The C-2100 fits in. But it is a snug fit. If you have any kind of accessories, other than two sets of batteries and a media card or two, forget it. You'll want a bag that is bigger. I don't like how you have to put the camera in on its back. I think I will find a bigger and better bag for the Olympus."
2,Nice but fell apart,"So I have had this case for maybe 6 or 7 years. We use it outside and on the ocean, but with long times between use in the elements. Most of the time it's in my climate controlled office. Within a year or so the ballistic nylon strap on the top started to fall apart. Little black dust-like pieces of the strap were all over shelf where it is kept. So I cut off the handle to stop it from shedding.Then it was the bottom strap that held on the buckle to hold the lid closed. Then it was the straps that hold on the shoulder strap. Now it's the strap that you can use to hold it on your belt.I really like the case for all the storage. We have a Coolpix 5700 and a flash in the main compartment. For personal use I have a case that's maybe 2 years older and it has fared much better. Next time I will try to find something that doesn't fall apart so quickly."
4,Canon Powershot S2 IS Bag,"Good solid product. Compact, yet dividable to fit a set of batteries and charger. Very happy with the product"
2,Too small!,"This bag might have been ""built for larger digital cameras and smaller digital camcorders"" but it isn't big enough for them! If you get this, you'll find you have to squash your cam in there with little room for other supplies in the main compartment. Also, the front pocket looks nice, but it only holds conventional items and can;t be made to fit what YOU want to hold. Pass on this one and check out Case Logic bags if you have a digital camera."
3,Tamrac 5696Digital6 Digital photo bag,"I like the bag but it is not as large as I had hoped. I am able to get the supplies into it, but it is not roomy and I cannot fit the guide book in. If I had it to do over I would not have purchased the bag. I would have waited, and gotten a larger bag at Walmart. Then I would not have had the shipping or the size issues."
4,"Me, myself..and Beyonce.","I personally love this song. I listen to it when I'm feeling depressed. It has a nice rhythm and blues feel to it, nice lyrics..all I could want in a song. Beyonce's voice is beautiful."
2,ok cut&Finally He first solo Release,after doing the Duet thing with Jay z on Crazy in Love&then Baby Boy with Sean Paul Beyonce finally has a Solo single released. this Cut is aight at best.the groove is nice but Beyonce hasn't grown through alot to really nail this kind of cat at this stage of her career.I'd like to Hear Beyonce Re-cut this track in a Decade&I bet Cash Money she would nail the Groove Proper.Her Material has a Window Dress feel about it&seems more Contrived than truly displaying that Tina Turner Element that wants to fully come out of Her.
2,Not Even Soul Enough,"Sometimes, when an artist goes solo, it doesn't even really showcase enough within their balance. That definitely goes for so many artists who do place their talent on their own. Beyonce Knowles is one of those artists. Her music seems to have gotten a little bit weaker for her scenario as a solo act. Her latest single, Me, Myself & I, is a weak ballad about moving on from a breakup, and declaring your on your own away from love. The song falls a whole lot more within the expectations I thought it would have. Not even as close as Crazy In Love with Jay-Z had. To be honest, she really should try to concentrate about reuniting Destiny's Chikd, before they are long gone in the process. Beyonce's solo efforts are really starting to become overexposed, and this song is one of the worst I've heard in sometime."
1,Any day now!,"I ordered my book a week and a half ago, and I still haven't received a confirmation email that my book has been shipped. I'm falling a little behind in class and it's the seller's fault. NO GO."
1,good book but very expensive,"Each chapter has examples and problems but no much explanation to solve the problems. Expensive book considering the information and help provided by the book. Same information (chapter by chapter) can be found in many other similar books, which may be lesser in price."
1,still havent received the book,I was told that the books i purchased would be shipped in 2 days. It has been over a week since I should have received the book and I finally got an email this morning saying it will not be shipped until Feb 11th another 2 weeks from now. dont use amazon !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Another bad math book from Lial,"I've had the unfortunate fate of being trapped in two courses with Margaret Lial textbooks, first college algebra and now basic calculus. Every section we've used (Chapters 11, 12, 13) comes with a short explanation usually peppered with abstract theory. The example problems presented in the lead-in to the homework provide very little clues toward solving homework problems because many steps are taken for granted and other problem types are entirely left out. When using the back of the book to check answers, it is just as incomprehensible. Lial will take inconsistent and unconventional algebraic steps towards providing an answer. The answers are still equivalent; however it will usually take the guidance of an instructor and/or tutor to show their equivalence, because many times it is not intuitive. I really can't think of any good aspects of this book, other than for a professor to use to produce a high dropout rate in their class."
4,Kawaii!,"Heehee, lovely, lovely CD. First Japanese Import I ever got. I loved it! It was -ver- kawaii!"
5,The original vampire series,"I used to run home from the bus stop everyday to catch the last 15 min of this series. Now I can see all of it! It may seem hokey to younger people but this was filmed live so mistakes weren't taken out. They didn't have the special effects like today, but this was a low budget series that didn't have to play by today's rules. Your imagination is supposed to fill in the gaps and gaffs."
4,"(I'm actually 13)This game is good, but...","Overall I'd say this game is OK. I'd definetly say, though, that it has some stuff that I would like to be fixed.First of all, why a third person view, like GoldenEye 007, let's have a first person.Second, the cheats, sometimes they have no meaning, like running faster, or some that just change back to normal whenever you complete an objective or go on another floor.Third, it looks like 007 got a bad haircut.Last, please do better on the new 007 game coming soon, Agent Under Fire."
2,OVERALL THIS GAME IS VERY SAD,"this game kinda sux. Its boring and hard and the graphics arent much. First of all i'd like 2 say that i like PC games SO much better than console. So maybe its just that fact but i doubt it. U should definetely get ""The world is not enough"" for the playstation buy this game and u get a piece of crud 3rd person shooter that is hard as heck without cheats. limited ammo is a pain. and also limited weapons. GET SOME OTHER GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!OR u just wasted ur moneyThe good thing about it is the car chase! and that u can shoot q like 15 times in the foot and THEN he finnally dies but the car chase is why i think it deservers 2 stars instead of 1 or 0"
2,Disappointing Bond,"I hate to see this game associated with the Bond franchise. The graphics are poor. The storyline is weak. It is too easy to win, if you don't get bored first. I liked the shooting aspects better than the driving or skiing (exceptionally lame). Lots of clipping problems. Nice music however. If you still think you may like it, rent it first."
2,bad game,"this game is very easy, and its pretty bad. i had very high expectations for this game, and i was disapointed when i beat the game, the whole game, in 2 hours. i had beat both of the hardness levels. besides being easy i found the graphics pretty bad and the game play slow. so i do not recommend this game for anyone."
1,This must be the worst Bond there is and there ever will be,"Ok,until the day I bought this game,I already played Bond games like the superb Goldeneye,the very good The World Is Not Enough for N64 and Agent Under Fire.I thought to myself that no Bond game could ever be worse than TWINE for PlayStation 1,but when I first played this game,I knew I was wrong.First of all,you play Bond from a Third-person perspective,which is pretty bad because of the poor controls.Sometimes I played TND without knowing what I was actually doing,but went through the level anyway.As if this weren't enough,the story of the movie couldn't have been worse adapted.The only real positive point about this game is the sound.There are some cool tracks on the disc,nothing more,nothing less.Last,but not least,I tell you:if you absolutely want a 007 game for your PlayStation,then buy The World Is Not Enough.It's not good either,but better than this."
1,worst shooter ever,"i purchaced this game when it first came out thinking that it would be better than goldeye. But, almost emediatly i saw that there are only 10 short missions and unrealalistic game play. the only way that this game got 1 star is for the OK infered gun (highly inacutate) and the full auto 9mm. otherwise this game [is not good]. when using the sniper rifle, you miss every time by about 50 feet..."
5,A STAPLE ITEM FOR PS2 OWNERS,"My son asked for this game for over a year!! It is a fun game. There is some shooting but, honestly this is no more that what you would see on the news! There is no profane language. The game itself has interresting puzzles to solve and advance to the next level. Just being 007 is fun!!"
2,me,ok i think james bond is really cool. if this game was like golden eye it would kick ... but it wasent. but still its a good game to rent once a while.
1,This game bites the big one!,I expected a lot more. This game was way too easy. I beat it the night I got it and the fact that there is no multiplayer mode makes it very dull once you beat it. The controls are horrible and the shooting is worse. If your looking for a good first person shooter try Medal Of Honor.
3,Good but not as good as Goldeneye,This game has good graphics and challenging modes but it doesn't live up to Goldeneye. It is a harder game than Goldeneye in my mind. It potrays the movie very well though. Having no multiplayer was also a loss to the quality of the game. I think that ''Tomarrow Never Dies'' is a pretty good game but I wouldn't highly reccommend it.
2,TND is a total dissappointment,I was looking for a fun game with a large choice of things to do. I bought TND and played it a little while and got bored. There are only 10 levels and about 6 weapons and you cant play with your friends. The game was a dissapointment BUY rainbow six instead
5,Better Than Goldeneye!,"This game is awesome! Even better than Goldeneye! The only drawback is the lack of multiplayer, but the graphics make up for that. And the codes for this game are great, if you can find them! This is one of my favorite games!"
1,40$ for a fake,"goldeneye good tnd very very very BADI'm a big 007 fan,so when i heard playstation came out with 007 a game i bought it right away thinking it was gonna be good. boy was i mistaken! first of all THERE'S NO 2 PLAYER! then it hardly related to the movie it was so easy i beat it in 1 3/4 hour. you'll think they'd make the game more fun but they didn't plus there's 10 yes 10 levels with only 6 ya 6 guns that dont even sound real. Im just hopen' that the world is not enough is as good as golden eye. do your self a favor and get syphon filter 2"
1,"EA,this is not your best","I can't believe this game was made by EA.They did great with TWINE but this game is pathetic.EA blew their chance of making this game great.It's a little like Syphon Filter because after awhile it's boring.It's worse than an EC rated game.Don't rent it,it's not worth a look .Buy TWINE instead."
2,EA should have done better with the Bond license,"I buy just about every action game that comes out for the Playstation and I have to say I was very disappointed with this one. The reason I bought the game is that I liked the whole idea of a third-person action adventure featuring Bond doing a variety of things: shooting, skiing, driving, etc. It sounded like a really great package. Unfortunately, the game is plagued with first-generation graphics, a choppy framerate, sloppy control, extremely easy missions, and very limited environments. About the best thing I can say for it is that it does include some cool Bond gadgets, a great intro, and good cut scenes between missions. The game is so short that it is only worthy as a rental. In fact, without a strategy guide, it can be beaten in a mere 5-7 hours. If you want to experience great mission-based games with some depth, go for Syphon Filter or Metal Gear Solid. Bond deserves much better than this! Electronic Arts, you blew it!"
4,007 never dies,"I was really looking foward to the release of TND and suffice it to say I was not let down. The game is quite fun although it is very short. The main problems with the game is the lack of control. The designers should have put a quick turn button as there are many situations that call for such an action. Also you have to position Bond right on top of a lock, switch, etc... before he will activate the device. Besides the minor control problems the graphics and sound are excellent and the FMV's are from the movie. Another nice feature is the ability to save the game right after the completion of a mission, so you can play for a half-hour and shut it off. While the game is not on the level or length of Metal Gear or Syphon Filter it is still alot of fun to play and is a must for the Bond enthusiast."
3,Hey.......... It's pretty fun,"after playing Goldeneye, I thought that any James bond game would not be fun. But, I actually found this game to be very exiting and fun. You get many new options like: driving a BMW, skiing and much much more! There were only two minor problems: one was that ther are only ten levels. I mean... come on here, this is JAMES BOND were talking about. The other is that THERE IS NO MULTIPLAYER! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"
1,BAD BAD BAD Game - Some Cool Effects Though,"Poorly assembled, strictly shoot 'em up, no strategy at ALL, filled with very annoying bugs...I thought it was going to be like Goldeneye but not even close! I like the way the combine the actual scenes from the movie, but that is the only redeaming quality. Rent this game before you buy it PLEASE!"
1,VERY BAD!,"this game was really boring. it was 2 easy for me, and the graphics and dialogue were catastrophic. if u really r a bond game fan, dont buy this one. this is the worst game ive ever played on a platform. dont buy the strategy book either. it will make it even worse. this is a non must buy game. this games trying to copy syphon filter. if it was one person shooting, it wouldve been better but still, its not good"
3,TRUTHFUL REVIEW: tommorrow never dies,"k, all you people who are out there right now expecting the fast paced first person shooter with multiplayer, think again. there's no multiplayer, and a third person view. and it is fast paced but not near as fun as n64's game. if you want a game to entertain you for about 5 days buy this, but i reccomend just renting this one, maybe they'll come out with a more solid game next time."
4,Tomorrow Never Dies for Playstation,"Although this game wasn't as good as Goldeneye, it has some excitement. The only thing that was down-right bad about this game is that there is no 2 player mode. The game has better graphics and seems to have better courses than Goldeneye. I still think Goldeneye has better amunition. If this game had a 2 player mode, Goldeneye would be in trash cans and people would be buying Playstation and this game. This game may prove to be tricky for begginers, but if you have a strategy guide, this game is a lot of fun, and can be played with for hours!"
1,A major dissapointment,"I expected this game to have all the realism and graphics of Goldeneye. IT is not even close. The game has decended to the depth of all-out shooters. WHile their is some strategy, involved, you get three lives a level, medkits, and the guards are stupid. YOu don't need to aim as long as you are pointed in the right general direction, and if you needed to, the controls wouldn't let you turn with precision. You cannot only runin 8 directions, and when guards die, their weapons turn into neat little ammo carttidges, pointed upwards, and tidilty lined up. If you are looking for the realism of Goldeneye, no way!"
3,Tomorrow Never Dies is for yesterday...,"Although 'Goldeneye' for the N64 was a total success, TND was not that great. If you are bored or have nothing better to do, this game would do.It started out okay, but as the game progressed the objectives of the game were getting stupider, I mean, like in the second mission, where you have to take pictures, if we wanted a game where we take pictures all we would have to do is get a N64 and get Pokemon Snap and while we are at it get Goldeneye.Other than that the game was overally boring, unless you haven't played many games, you would find this game extremely enjoyable."
3,I waited so long for nothing.,"I waited and waited and waited for this game to arrive, and it finally did. All the rumors that this would blow the preceeding game out of the water was malarkey, because the third person gameplay, the poor graphics and controll and the loading time (a side effect of playstation) made this game bomb out."
1,BBBBBBBBBBBBBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDDDDD,bad bad bad badbadbbadbabdbabdbabdbabdbbbbbb Bad Game i would give it zero starrss ifn it were they're
2,Nothing like Goldeneye,"This game was absolutely nothing like Goldeneye. If you liked Goldeneye for N64, you will dislike this and I would suggest that you don't buy it. What happened to the multi-player matches? That is the most fun in a Bond game. And this title does not have them. If you ask me, I think that this game was too complicated. You get to go on foot, BMW, or ski. You have this very high-equipment. Unlike in Goldeneye, where everything is kept pretty simple. But remember, this is only my opinion. If you like the idea of being able to travel on more surfaces, getting to drive a car, and not having multi-player matches, then you should definitely get this game. But if you are a Bond fan, and you liked the other Goldeneye game for N64, do not get this game."
3,"An average and easy game, but fun for fans like me.","I liked this game. I know that it is short, but I'f your a true fan, you get into it and play it a lot! I still think they should of made the gameplay more like Medal of Honor, but, maybe next time. I have to say, it is an average game. (I beat it in 3 hours! I'm not even the best!)"
3,Not Much,"This game looked nice on the shelf, and thinking it could match or beat Goldeneye, I gave it a shot. Bummer, the plot is not at all involving, the controls are sluggish, not very many levels, weapons suck, and there isn't any reason to go back and have fun with levels like sneaking around getting head shots like in Goldeneye. Everything is controlled, you get no options on how to beat the level like which path to take or anything. Not worth the money."
2,Big Wind Bitten Hard,This has to be the worst game made for the Playstation console. Outdated graphics. 5 different weapons. And 10 levels that are shorter than Sonic the Hedgehog 1 2 and 3.
1,Get ready to be let down,"If you are looking for excitement and a challenge, this game is not for you. I bought this game two days ago for my husband. In less that 7 hours of play he beat the agent level. After just 4 more hours of play he is two missions away from beating 007 mode. This is with no strategy guides or walkthroughs. He feels absolutely no challenge in this game. This is from the same guy who still has not beaten Goldeneye for the Nintendo 64 (we believe there is no way to beat it without a game shark)after two years of playing it. Don't buy this game unless you have money to blow or just want to add to your collection."
3,its not THAT bad,"the 3rd person view insn't horrible. its not as good as goldeneye, but it is still a good game. it has 10 levels( ...) but some of them are hard. there are ten weapons. one thing it has that goldeneye doesn't is stealth mode. you creep up behind them and kills them istantly. all in all its pretty good."
4,Surprisingly creative,"I'm quite startled of some of the mixed reviews this game got. This game was actually great and the missions aren't that simple (even though they have a lot of medkits.) The graphics are very good and the film clips at the beginning of the game are nice. Besides the fact that this game is really good, the sound is kind of bad. The sound of Bond's gun and voice is repetituous and can sometimes become annoying. These are only minor problems that don't drop the game's rating to two stars. I play it often and I think it is a lot like Syphon Filter (except that was better.) If you can withstand these problems, get this game. If not, rent it first."
4,pretty gpod but not the best,... at the beginning i was stuck on the first level but a friend helped me to get to the fifth level and now i've almost finished it. I think that the missions are good and there lots of bad guys to shoot but the graphics aren't really very realistic and the colours aren't like in the film. i would say that the new one The World is Not Enough is better but harder to control.
2,expected more,"After the wait for Tommorow Never Dies I was expecting a game superior to the last Tomb Raider or,a game it has been compared to, Syphon Filter. My first complaint were the controls. After getting used to sneaking around corners in Syphon Filter and Metal Gear Solid I found the character bumping into edges. Also was the targeting. You can line Bond's crosshairs up on a target's head and still have to put multiple rounds into the target to drop him. Overall the look of the game seemed unpolished. The various scenarios lacked depth and the enemies moved stiffly. My suggestion is to rent this one first before even considering plunking down the cash on the purchase. If you do want action/espionage you'd do better to pick up Syphon Filter or the best of the genre: Metal Gear Solid."
2,Its no Goldeneye,"There are a few problems with this game. The control is unresponsive, the graphics are fairly grainy, and its difficult to tell when someone is actually shooting you. Everything that Goldeneye was, this game is far from, and not in the direction it needs to be. Rent this one first."
2,Mediocre game based on a mediocre entry in the Bond series,"007 fans, stay away! This game captures none of the style or suaveness of our favorite agent in her majesty's secret service. Being based on one the worst Bond films of all time, I didn't expect much out of this. The game is all shooting and trying to blow things up. Why didn't they include a plot? Why not include a good villian? Why is there no scene with 007 gambling in a Casino? Where is Bond's humor? Where are the stylish action sequences that make Bond great? This game has mediocre graphics, bad control, and has no business having the 007 name on it. The only good part about this game is that you can actually see Bond as you are playing as him ( unlike Goldeneye ). The only good action sequence is a ski chase which reminds 007 fans of The Spy Who Loved Me. Why didn't MGM make a video game out of a good Bond movie ( From Russia With Love anyone? ). Buy good espionage games like Syphon Filter and Mission Impossible instead."
1,Listen up,"I rented this game after christmas and i can say that it is not what it was supposed to be like. There isn't even a 2 player deathmatch! How stupid is a bond game with just the regular missions that are rediculous and boring. I rented it and I played it for about a day, and thats all i ever want to play it."
2,Tomorrow Never Dies is disappointing,"To state it briefly, this game isn't what is should be. If you're looking for an espionage, spy game play Metal Gear Solid instead. Or if you simply must play a Bond game, buy a N64 and play Goldeneye. This game might be fun to rent, but it's not a keeper."
2,gamer from Los Angeles,"This game is nothing but a copy off of both Syphon Filter and Goldeneye. It has terrible graphics and only 5 weapons. Believe me, if you like action/shooter games then your much better off getting a game like Syphon Filter 1 or 2 or Rainbow Six. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!"
4,This game is pretty good,"but without 2 players it's a but boring, especially because it's so easy. It's also confusing if you haven't seen the movie. I gave it 4 stars because I had fun playing it. But that's because I love 1st person shooters like 007. Also I think Goldeneye was much better."
4,Excellent,"It's true that this CD isn't anything overly new or original, but you saw what happens lately when The Cure try something new (Wild Mood Swings...) I think this album is actually among The Cure's best. It reminds me of Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me in that there are so many different sounds being achieved. Plus ""Taking Off"" sounds a lot like ""Just Like Heaven,"" so that never hurts. My only problem with this album is the sound of the drums. I like Jason Cooper, but a lot of the drum parts are way too flashy for what the songs require.All in all I think this is a really great CD. It shows that Robert can still sing his heart out, and that he can still write so many diverse songs. I wouldn't pay attention to all the negative reviews. It's alot easier to look back at albums that came out 15 or 20 years ago and say how awesome they were. This isn't the '80s, so I don't think another Disintegration would be appropriate."
3,I just can't connect with this album,"There is something horribly missing with this album, and I believe it is the depth and intimacy you find with a Cure album. There is very little beauty here, just angst, and who wants to hear angst from a bunch of 45 year olds? Just listen to ""There is No If"" from Bloodflowers and tell me it is not more moving than anything you can find on this album. This is the most personally unsatisfying Cure record to date."
2,"""Never"" is the worst Cure song ever written.","Wow, The Cure have hit a new low. I could tell this was going to be garbage from their shotty video for the single ""End of the World"" to the even worse cover art. Now that I've actually listened to the whole album straight through, I must say the music is worse than both the video and the cover art combined.Robert Smith's lyrics have grown boring and cliche and the beautiful, dark melodies and imagery that we once heard on Disintegration, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Wish and even friggin' Pornography are all gone. I don't know whether to blame the band or Ross Robinson. Either way this album is terrible.The only reason it gets two stars is because I was smart enough to buy the import which had more songs on it, one in particular which is actually very good and shows what could have been."
5,"If you don&#65533;t like this album, you don&#65533;t like The Cure",The best album since Disintegration1. Lost : remember Snake pit - A good intro2. Labyrinth : remember Burn - PSYCHEDELIC3. Before Three - rember Maybe someday but better4. End of the World - One of the best pop song of the band --- Between Sonic Youth and New Order --- Between Boys don't cry and In between days5. Anniversary - remember Disintegration area - AMBIANT and NOSTALGIC6. Us or Them - remember End - R.Smith is angry7. Alt. End - remember IN your house (seventeen seconds)8. (I Don't Know What's Going) On... VERY GOOD VOCALS - A good pop song - remeber A pink dream9. Taking Off - remember 2 late or Just like heaven with something more10. Never - Between 3 imaginary boys area and 39 - hard and powerful11. Promise -remember the kiss - PSYCHEDELIC
4,the best Cure album in years,"This is the best Cure album in years. The DVD is a bit disappointing, I was expecting more. Thats why I gave it a 4. If you liked The Cures less poppie music you will like this... there's no ""Just like Heaven"" here, which IMHO is a good thing. Get it you'll like it."
3,The Cure can do better than this,"Hey look, its The Cure we're discussing here; one of the greatest bands of all time. Having said that, The Cure could've done much better on this album. This is not to say that this is a bad album, it's just that Robert Smith and company are capable of much more. In listening to this album, it seemed that The Cure lacked some creativity despite the fact that Ross Robinson was the producer. Being that I bought this album on vinyl, some of the bonus tracks such as The Promise and Going Nowhere redeemed this album from complete mediocrity. I'm with DJ Ridge in the opinion that Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me was the pinnacle of The Cure's career. I also love Disintegration and Wish, and would rate both those albums as a close second to The Kiss Me record. Maybe The Cure is just getting warmed up for their next masterpiece.P.S: Where's the darkness that Robert promised in the Trilogy video?"
3,"Good album, bad DVD.","Being the owner of every other ""Cure"" album, I find this one falls somewhere in the middle of the pack. It's not a classic, however it does get better with each listen. It's also not near as lush or moody as albums such as ""Bloodflowers"" or ""Disintegration"", but much more of a rock record, complete with yelling and loud guitars. It does of course still sound like ""The Cure"", just a new ""Cure"". As far as the DVD goes, it's the worst bonus disc I've ever seen, and is nothing but studio shots and boredom. I may not even ever see it twice. But musically, it's a solid rocking ""Cure"" album, and does get better with each play. That's a ""Promise""."
5,buy the cd,i say buy the cd because it's a world of difference between the streamed online version and the cd. If you are reviewing this album from hearing the free steam on one of the websites(some have reviewed it from this) then you are not hearing the album.i think it's rather clever of amazon to package sonic youth along with the cure since at times it feels like sonic youth is in the backround of this album with all the noise art rock and feedback.this album is brilliant..it would be perfect if the songs never and taking off were replaced by fake and truth goodness and beauty
2,Preview it before buying it,"It's certainly an album that has to grow in you.Be smart and preview the album before buying it.If you're new to The Cure don't start with this album, pick ""Staring at the Sea: The Singles"" and ""Galore"" to get an overview of the band."
4,Back To Basics,"The Bloodflowers project was the Cure's most melancholy and dark CD project than previous projects. From that CD project, it seems from the feeling of the song ""39"" from Bloodflowers is jettisoned into the entrire feeling , complete with sonic guitars, up beat and strong moods that saturate this new 2004 CD project. The themes are similar for The Cure good loving gone bad, the occassional happy relationship, yet there is a bit more angst in the song ""Us And Them"". Definitely, this is a back to basics project. On the whole, it is a must have for all Cure fans. The first promotional song ""The End of The World"" will be slated to get the first air play on radio including XM/Sirius satelite radio. There are other good songs such as ""Taking Off""""Lost"", ""Labyrinth"", ""Before Three"", ""(I Don't Know What's Going)On"" and ""The Promise"". The Cure gets back to basics and hits the mark on this new release. Get it Today!"
1,I want my money back!,"This album is not The Cure I once knew and loved. Having been a Cure fan since the 80's, I have to say this is the biggest disappointment I've ever had the displeasure of listening to. Robert's screaming here is enough to annoy the dead. I'm afraid the days of KMKMKM, Disintergration, and Wish are all but dead and gone.Do yourself a favor and spend your money on Morrissey's 'You Are The Quarry' instead."
1,If you liked Wild Mood Swings...,...then this might be a great album. If you thought WMS sucked like I did then you might think this one sucks too. Not that I'm making a direct comparison to the two albums but both live in my CD rack untouched. I gave this CD 2 listens and it was enough. The songs meander without going anywhere or they are pseudo-metal garbage. I'm not a casual Cure fan - I've bought every studio album release they have and then some. It just doesn't connect with me whatsover. Perhaps the paring down the group to a trio will change the direction Robert is taking but I hope this is not the future sounds of The Cure.Maybe I'm just missing something.
2,The end of Flowers,"Well, I think that more than 20 years enchanting us with all their dazzling stuff, one day had to stop. I don't know why, but probably will happen the same to Tim Burton in the movies.Cure's last album has a sound too childish. Pardon me to say that, but I'm a Cure fan since the start. People who likes ""Pornography"", ""Top"", ""Japanese Whispers"", sorry but can't enjoying their last album production. I think the tracks even can be great, but the sound's no good. Their glamorous lovely gothstyle to turned into an hysterical claim of what? Is this a wink at american rude sound? Well, I'll love them anyway."
1,Cure's successful flirt with irrelevancy..,"I heard this album 3 or 4 times and after each time i found myself asking ""what's the point""?? That it's in no way reminiscent of Cure's glorious past is obvious for anybody that knows the group unless you happen to be a hardcore die-hard fan.If not, i hardly see how this LP will not be soon collecting dust on your shelf. Almost all the songs (with maybe 1 or 2 escaping) are mediocre at best, uninspired, tired, perhaps even hurried.Smith's voice is hardly recognisable, and if he was trying out new things it seems that he should immediately drop the experiments and stick to singing the way he knows how. Unless that's not an option anymore.Ultimately, the worrying signs were already there in ""Bloodflowers"" to be heard, even though that album was even better than the current release. That says it all.If the group continue on this path they will put a stain on their legendary name. Others have done that before them. Pity..."
2,What is this?,"Being a Cure Fan longer than most of the ages of people attending their concerts, I can safely say, this CD is by far the most disappointing album they have ever made. If you are new to the Cure, I would recommend their previous albums, where their real talent shows. As for the DVD, it too is not worth the extra bucks. I would recommend the Trilogy DVD, more expensive, but worth the money."
2,I tried ... I really did,Despite the poor reviews on aother websites I still went out and bought this cd . I should of know I made a bad choice .First problem is the melodies are boring ... they hardly change . I thought with all the time they had it would be more emotional . He even repeats the lyrics a lot . I have respect for who they were but this cd just tells me they didn't put enough into it . I was real excited too about getting it . Luckily I only paid 10 bucks for it at Best B .Oh well .... please wait for the sound clips before buying this cd .
4,Life is sad,"The Cure is one of the most influential bands of the past 25 years. They appeal to young adults who have become disenchanted with society. They appeal to people with a sense of romanticism. They don't really appeal to people who have been happy all their lives. The Cure have done their dark records and their more pop oriented ones. This record falls somewhere in between. ""Lost"" and ""Labyrinth"" fall into earlier ""Pornography"" period that focused on dark themes. ""Before Three"" and ""The End of The World"" is more reminiscent of their pop sensibility. We are reintroduced to Robert Smith's worldview that encompasses existentialism and romanticism. He makes things more political in ""Us Or Them."" If life is so bad, why continue? Smith always promises us the end or finality. No one would be surprised if he killed himself tomorrow."
4,The Cure in raw fashion,"As a long time Cure fan I have always looked at each record as an individual piece of work. This creation is The Cure's rawest piece yet. Its initally a bit abrasive yet still has the emotion you would find in any cure record. This is not polished like Disintegration or Wish, and has a quality you will not find on any other Cure record.There are familiar emotions of past Cure songs on this record but has a bit of twist. Tracks like The End Of The World, Before Three and esecially Taking Off are just great songs. This isnt The Cure trying to recreate the past , they are still just writing good songs.They have nothing to prove, just buy it appreciate it for what it is."
5,Not disappointing at all....,"this is a great CD... read my other review... I messed this one up, so I just killed it. Anyways... enjoy.... Robert's voice has never sounded better, jason is really coming into his own as an excellent Cure drummer... the guitars, basses and keyboards create wonderful textures for Robert to float on top of...."
1,"This Really Pains Me, But I Must Speak Out","I hate to say it, but this record is dismal. From the cover art, to the music, everything about it is awful. I have been a Cure fan since the early 80's and I keep getting fooled by each new record since Disintegration. They have not put out a decent one since, and this one does not buck the trend. The lyrics are pitiful, the music is terrible, the production is atrocious (Why Ross Robinson????). Do NOT buy this record."
2,Boring and uneven,"I have always been a Cure fan, but this was the first one that did nothing for me at all. Can't find a single hook or good melody. Listened to it 4 times so far, keep hitting the ""next track"" button. A HUGE disappointment. The songs sound - MESSY and disorganized."
2,The Cure,Certainly not the greatest cure album available and not one that I would recommend. I found that there are a couple of tracks on this album that are quite good but they are brought down by the fact that most of the songs are very poor. Only for die hard Cure fans who have nothing else to spend their money on....oh and the dvd is rubbish and merely a collectors item.
5,The Angel Of Alt.,"If you one don't care for this album, you were a poser to begin with and the(music) world would be better off without you. The darkness is to consume and embrace The Cure like a haunting whisper or a wailing rage. If Robert is happy then so are we, if he hates -well get the point. The music of this album is lyrical- showing both sophisticated chord modulation and dissonence. The polarization of sound lends it a remarkable contrast from song to song. The lyrics are laden with deep, depression rooted turmoil and ire laced hatred or, (Robert) patented manic happines and giddy frivolity riddled with soaring crescendos. It's simply marvelous. Who are you F#&%ing mainstream punks to judge the likes of such a demigod?? If the people at Amazon won't show this review then they're just as much part of the problem as you!! I Should care if you love or hate it , I should care but...Darkling"
3,Voodoo Dolly,"More overproduced songs to tease your hair by. I used to be a fan and saw The Cure live a few times back in the early eighties. They were great then but now they need a cure themselves. The songs on this disk go absolutely nowhere most of the time but some of the sound production is seductive. Robert Smith derailed his train a long time ago and can't see past his Elizabeth Taylor on 400 volts hairdo enough to realise it. He does ,as always have an interesting voice which makes him original enough to be better than most of the bands I slam in my reviews. I believe in natural selection for artists of all media and at least this guy does have business recording music.Tenench advise for Mr Smith is for an image overhaul (lose the lipstick and hairdo), do some soul searching and try something different for a change. I think Smith still has something to offer given the right spark of an idea to entice him away from the formula driven songwriting explored in the past decade."
1,What were they thinking?,"Being a long-time Cure fan I decided to purchase their latest album. To say that this CD is disappointing would be an understatement. The songs lack the edge The Cure is known for. Frankly, each song sounds the same as the last...Robert Smith sounds like he isn't even trying...like he doesn't care.The songs are repetitive and droning. This isn't a ""fun"" album...I found myself anxious for each song to end. I've listened to the album three times hoping that perhaps it would grow on me...it hasn't; I don't think it will.I wish I could get my money back."
3,The Cure review,Robert is past his prime but this album is him working VERY hard to keep up good art. Robert will ALWAYS be a genius though. All greats fall due to age. I will ALWAYS love The Cure no matter how bad they get.I think cure fans will love my own music. It really is amazing. Just give it a chance and you will NOT be sorry. It really is better than the new Cure album by far.http://www.theredsea.biz
1,It gave me severe head pain,"I took only two pills a day, and it gave me unbearable pain on back of my head. I do not know what cause it, but pain stopped as soon as I didn't take. Bottle does not state any side effects, but something is not right..."
3,Eddie Condon's Bixieland: Treasury of Jazz,"When I purchased this cd I expected to be able to hear Condon's playing; however, I hear every instrument except his. This was a disappointment. The music is entertaining. I just wanted to hear Condon playing. Did I have cotton in my ears? NO. It should have been called Treasury of Jazz--Eddie Condon's Favorites by His Buddies."
5,Perfect for iMac/PowerBook!,"I recently purchased the TRV103 (which is nearly identical to the 110) and it is a fantastic camcorder. It also connects easily to iMac and the new PowerBook G3 via FireWire and, with no extra hardware, allows capture and editing. This is the perfect camera for us as we have a newborn and want to share pictures/movies with distant relatives. A great purchase."
3,Endurance,"The drill is good for light to medium duty work.(The hammer part is a little weak). I wore out a good brand drill bit, and had three holes to drill thru 10"" of wall with a 7/8"" carbide bit. You pay for what you get, but it is really good for the light work. Be sure to purchase good masonry bits to perform the job. If it had more hammer, it would have done the job. Over-all a good choice for the dollar. Also it does well with regular drilling for stud or joist work. So it's a pretty good purchase."
2,Motor burned up after 15 holes,"I drilled fifteen 3/4"" holes, 4 inches deep, before the motor burned up. it is now garbage. Not worth the money. I would expect it to last years not minutes."
3,Not quite a Milwaukee,"I don't know for sure, but this drill looks suspiciously like another brand of hammer drill. I still bought it, because I like Milwaukee and it had more power than the older 5370 that I tested. It worked very well drilling concrete and had plenty of power for thick pressure treated wood. Unfortunately, after a couple of hours use, the variable speed switch stopped working. It was either on or off, no in between. I am sure Milwaukee's warranty would have covered it, but I decided to return it and get the more Milwaukee looking 5387."
5,French - Delicious Classic Cuisine,"As a beginner to French cooking I found this cookbook to be perfect!! The pictures were clear and big, the recipes, though traditional and authentic, were easy to follow and not complicated. So far, everything that I have made from this cookbook has been delicious and turned out just like the picture! :o))) This is definitely a new favorite cookbook and is becoming an often-used cookbook!"
4,CAUTION!!! multiple editions exist,"one of my favorite go-to cookbooks for desserts! My original copy got ruined, so my mother graciously gave me hers....i was stunned to find that three of my favorite recipes were NOT in her version. Now im desperately trying to figure out how I can identify my original book, since it's long been thrown away. Look for the version that has fruit tarts and the strawberry Mille feuille."
4,French Cooking made easy,Found this book in a vacation home rental in France - we referenced it many times during our stay and ordered it upon our return home. Great recipes!
1,Crappy movie,Brinke Steven's is in here but as the 'opening scene victim'.The camera angles suck and so does the acting.The monster was realy crappy looking to.I cant bealive I blew 14 dollars on the so called horror movie.Dont buy or rent it its not even worth a penny.
2,What to say here....,"In many places the low budget really shows on this one {lighting, makeup, horrible CGI}, but it's still better than most movies of this type. I wish Brinke Stevens had been given more to do. Savini is cool as always, and the rest of the cast is quite likeable. It's better then Octopus 2 but not as good as Blood Surf."
4,Matt Green Is Awesome!!! Great Cast!!1,"Matt Green's Style of directing is very cool. Bill Mosley does a great job as an authority figure. Tom Savini plays the usual hard-ass who does meet his fate in the end. The whole concept is very well thought out. The effects are ok. The CGI sucks , but what CGI I doesn't. Hey, it even has the kid from Pumpkinhead. Anyone who has a huge amount of money for a horror movie to be made should give it to Matt Green to make a feature film, He is going to be a famous director if he keeps this up."
1,Sucks,"We didn't like this one at all. The guitar tone is depressing. The pieces ""Diary of ..."" is a disaster... perfect for a suicide clinic, we said :)"
2,guitar for sale,"When will William Anderson trade in his f-hole Humphrey guitar for something new? It must be the worse sounding guitar I've ever heard. Just listen to the tone quality as compared to the piano in the wonderful Wuorinen Sonata - putting strings on a cardboard box would sound better. There is some wonderful playing on this CD, however, can not be recommended due to Anderson's poor choice of instrument."
5,Theraputically helpful for this tinnitus patient,"Every tinnitus patient is different, of course, but I find this recording to be very theraputic. I have severe tinnitus that used to cause me chronic insomnia (which led to exhaustion, depression, and wishing that I could ""end it all""). I used Neuromonics which helped me desensitize to tinnitus and eventually ignore it most of the time.I discovered this recording after being on Neuromonics. I have it in a lossless file format on an mp3 player, and I use Bang & Olufsen A8s or Sennheiser IE6s for listening. I have it on a continuous loop and use it for a few hours when my tinnitus is bad. I play it at a volume level in which it does not fully cover up or mask my tinnitus sound. So I can still hear the tinnitus as well as the rainsticks. This rainstick sound is beautiful and soothing to me, and using it on occasion helps me stay desensitized to tinnitus.To put it more simply, this disc is worth its weight in gold to me."
3,No Surprises,"Julie London's posthumous popularity has been enhanced recently by the series of ""2-fer"" reissues of London's back catalogue on EMI Holland. In a play on the Julie Is Her Name title of one of London's signature releases, Jacintha offers her own take on a set of London's bridges to another time. Perfectly capturing London's dusky alto, Jacintha breathes the essence of the smoky, moody cocktail jazz with which London easily seduced her listeners. However, like many tribute albums, this one suffers a bit when compared with the artist's original works. This is due mainly to Jacintha's relative lack of interpretive license taken with London's material. For example, London smoldered through The Doors' ""Light My Fire,"" giving a sensual twist to Jim Morrison's lyrics. Jacintha replicates London's languorousness, but without the heat. She's still a pleasure to hear, but don't expect any surprises"
2,"Jazz, Relaxing. Good Sleeping music,","Sorry,This lady is good but man she goes to slow and low for me.Many obviously love her, so that means she is good for them but not for this dude.If you want great love making music or music to nod you out buy it.But I found her hard to listen to and understand."
5,I love this brother,"I first listened to Smokie on the UNCF Evening of Stars. This man sung this one song ""I Need You Know"" so majestically that it made me an atheist want to go to church. He brought tears to my eyes because it has been so long since a gospel song affected me so deeply. He voice is blessed. You gotta hear it."
5,saving labor,Had the first batch of thiese light bulds installed for over one year now and didn't have to change them again ever. Didn't have to use my ladder as much any more.
5,Does the job,"We needed more light and this bulb is the answer. If it lasts 20,000 hours as claimed there is nothing more to say."
3,the lighting does not look correct,my wife does not like the way it looks when being used outside or inside its not all the bright
4,Excatly what I wanted,These wheels were at a great price. I am looking forward to using them this summer. These wheels are to replace the plastic ones that came with the mower that don't turn as freely as ones with bearings. From past experience the plastic ones wear the holes and axles which cause the wheels to have more play.
4,Plenty Rooms and easy to use!,"I ordered this a while ago and find it very roomy for two camaras such as digital camara and other regular compact camara too. This bag looks like a purse and has plenty rooms for almost everything that you could fill in such as wallet, cigarette, extra films. It has alot of pocket holders there, handler, scrap shoulder and belt holder but you have to wear a belt to hold it up. That is one thing that I am disappoint. It was worth to use for boat, shore, concert and anywhere you go. I like it very much!"
4,Plenty rooms and Easy to Use,"I find this very easy to use and has plenty of rooms for wallet, extra films and etc. It has pockets, zippers, scrap shoulder, handler and belt but you have to wear a belt which is why I gave them four stars. I can use my digital camera and regular compact camera in it. This bag looks like a purse. You can take it with you anywhere you want to go. It's very light to carry on. I like it very much! One thing that I am disappoint was belt. The material is pretty good too."
5,A Great Buy,This was a great purchase. Both seasons in one set was fabulous and the price was decent. Really appreciated the product. Thanks!
3,Pedinol Pharmacal Fungoid Tincture,"I have been using it to treat a fungus infectilon of my big toe nails for a month. It does not seem to have made a difference. These infections are very difficult to treat, even with ingested antifungal agents, and a healing may take more time."
4,FIFA 2000 is a great game!,"I know there have been a lot of mixed reviews for this game, but I have to say that FIFA 2000 is a great game! The addition of MLS teams makes it much more enjoyable for the American soccer fan. The uniforms look great and the flow of the game is pretty fluid once you get the hang of it. The classic teams are fun to play with if you are a soccer purist. Being able to play as Pele (No.10) and Beckenbauer and Ricky Davis with the New York Cosmos from their hey-dey in the 70's is great! The updated team rosters for the European clubs is another bonus. I was a little upset to see that Portugal's club teams and national team were left off of this year's game, and I'm still wondering why Brian McBride isn't on the Columbus Crew roster. As for the new commentators (Schoen and Foudy), they aren't bad. Motson and Lineker were more fun to listen to on FIFA 99, but the overall game is better in 2000! Buy this game! You will not be disappointed."
4,"Fun gameplay, turn off the sound","I have enjoyed FIFA2K for the past 8 months. It's fun gameplay, and has a lot of opportunities to modify the teams, leagues, and tournaments, as well as camera angles and on-screen information. The gameplay is pretty good, but don't allow the computer to have a corner kick or a free kick near the box.My recommendation if you purchase this is turn off the commentator and music sound, and put Andy Cole and Dwight Yorke up front in a 3-5-2 formation.I wish that the national teams were as modifiable as the club teams. I think that the English side has a bunch of players that aren't up to snuff."
3,where is the caribbean teams?,"the graphics on fifa 2000 has greatly improved. in this game the goal-keepers really protect the goals. the commentary however, needs the united kingdom's flavor. i would guess that most buyers are not of the united states and jamaica is not the only caribbean team. i would love to see trinidad and tobago, cuba, and haiti in the reenactment of the goal cup in which they have been consistent. i know you can't please everyone, but caribbean teams deserves a bit more repesentation."
4,"A step up, yet a step back","I was very excited when I saw FIFA 2000 come out, and when I got it, I loved playing it. But there are some things I don't like about it. First off, I think that FIFA needs to get the womens teams on the next game. Also, I really miss how you could add players to your national team. But on the plus side, they finally added the MLS. About time. Overall though, I do enjoy playing FIFA 2000, so I would recommend it to soccer purists."
3,Not as good as FIFA 99,"I bought this one because I was interested in getting the MLS teams. There were a few roster mistakes, and some of the audio names do not match the real names (I think they developed the audio in 1998 b/c they refer to Clash defender Jimmy Conrad as Draguicevich who is no longer with the team). The uniforms look great, but they're the year 1 unis, (like the hated celery for the clash) It's hard to make long passes. It's hard to keep possession on throw ins, despite the addition of set pieces, you actually have fewer options on free kicks. The difference in levels is very big - I was either losing by 10 or winning by 10. I don't regret buying it, but I haven't shelved my 99 yet!"
2,WHY OH WHY DID THEY GET RID OF JOHN MOTSON,"I grew up in England, and FIFA 99 was BY FAR the best soccer game available - and the best part was hearing John Motson and Gary Lineker doing the commentary - in the new game, it's Julie Foudy - BAD MOVE! Julie Foudy isn't an announcer, her voice grates on your ears, and apart form anything else, all the audio for the player names seems to have vanished....Put FIFA 99 Audio capabilities with FIFA 2000 gameplay and you'd have the perfect game - otherwise, stick with FIFA 99...."
4,Buy the PC version and download the John Motson patch,"EA has tried to cash in on the recent wave of the women's world cup using julie foudy as an announcer. Cute idea, but soccer purists are what made FIFA 99 a cult hit. This game is an arcade style commercial sellout from the first screen. Julie Foudy is a great women's soccer player, but she just doesn't fit this game. Why don't they make a women's FIFA 2000 and bring out a FIFA 2000 v.2 with the old announcers and style of play."
2,Disappointed,"I really liked FIFA1999 and was hoping that FIFA2000 would be better. I am glad I didn't sell my old FIFA. The graphics are not that better. It is harder to regulate the options of the game. Controlling the ball is harder. And probably most importantly for me, it is not even close to reality. Excuse me, if you are a Lebanese, but how could Lebanon win the World Cup? Or Australia? Also, the UEFA Champions League is not composed of the teams that participated in the tournament that year. ... Well, at the end, I should give some credit to the music selection. Really good music!Now that FIFA2000 has disappointed me, I am really hoping FIFA2001 is better."
4,Sweet Sweat Review,"It works, a light coat onto where you desire to lose fat and a moderate workout is all it takes, it wont keep it off, but if you constantly workout, use this, it will tone that skin and fat,...I recommend it, its a fast way to heat up those muscles and get your blood pumping"
5,Sweet Sweat,It is great stuff! Sweet sweat does enhance your workout and you burn or sweat twice as much as normal.
2,Didn't see a difference,"I used this with a waist trimmer with a regular cardio workout. Doesn't make a difference. My diet is all organic and I have a regular work out routine. I'm sure it depends on your age and body type. I'm in my 40s and am in excellent shape (except for that mid life lower poofy belly) for my age group. I just didn't see the results that I thought I would. It is what is is though. I'm sure it wasn't the product, but genetics and my high expectations."
1,Just Wax don't waste your money,"I bought this truly believing the reviews. All you are doing is rubbing wax on you. When your body gets hot, the wax does to and melts right off. I have not noticed a difference at all when i use it to when i dont besides extremely messey. You have to apply alot because as soon as it hits your skin it is like oil. You go thru this jar extremely fast if you wanted to put wax on you everyday while you work out. Not worth the money at all."
1,it gives you illusion that you are sweating,Just think body heat plus wax. Anything waxy if you put in a heat will melt. When you use this product it will seem that you are sweating but not. Only looks like your sweating due to the wax ingredient of this product is melting from your body heat.The best thing to do is warm shower before and after workout. Warm shower right before workout will help you produce sweat. Try doing that before you buy this product. :)
3,Sorry,"I'm sorry I can't give a good review right now, because I really haven't used it yet. So don't take my word for it."
1,This product does not seem to do much,Sure you sweat but there has been no decrease in fat at all after two weeks use. Rather dissatisfied with this product.
5,Really good product,Me puse el producto en areas donde me cuesta mucho sudar y realmente funciona. Solo se necesita un pequeña aplicacion.
4,sweet,"it really makes you sweat on the areas you put it. just wrap some plastic wrap after applications with mcdavid waist trimmerand do your workout, you won't be disappointed"
4,great product,"I workout 6 days a week for 2 hours... it works great for me because it allows me to sweat out some water weight. This is not a magic gel, it's not suppose to make you lose weight, that actually takes some effort on your part. All this gel does, is help you sweat fast, i have lost a few inches but its a combination on using sweet sweat, eating right and WORKING OUT."
2,disappointing,"unfortunately it stained all off my gym clothes,, so unless u wrap urself in somethig i dont recomend it. sorry"
2,Not sure,"I tried it, but frankly it does stain the clothes and so I stopped using it. I never noticed anything more that normal to be honest."
5,"This product is ""The Bomb""!!","Ya Man! You wanna sweat at the gym, Man? Well this is the 'Old School' product! And 13.5 oz's of it, as well!Ya Man (and Ladies too), this is the same product as it was 20 years ago. And still acceptable in the gyms as well, these days."
4,Wish I spoke Greek !!,"Great mix of dance music. Almost all singing in Greek (1 or 2 songs in English). I don't speak Greek, but the songs are that catchy that I play this quite a bit anyway! I say give it a try!"
3,2x clip-on magnifiers,"These are very much like the clip-on sunglasses I use, and are what I was looking for. But you are correctly warned they may not stay flipped up. If your head is down, they also may not stay flipped down. I'm tempted to glue them in the down position. I did not notice until I received them that 2x meant 4 diopter. That's awfully strong, but still useful."
1,deconstructing truth.,"If you are a ""red stater"" you will not like this book.Not much to argue with, if you are a fan of America-bashing and Israel-bashing dressed up as a criticism of the NewYork Times. Howard Friel is a hardcore leftwing dogmatist who does not hesitate to lie, freely, to advance his cause, and this book is a desperate attempt to shore up his cause: ostensibly, that the NYT is a puppet of the evil American-Jewish axis. He also supported North Vietnam against the US and objected to the first GulfWar.If you take your hate-filled leftism straight, this book is for you. P.E.S.T. sufferers should take this book in moderation, as it will excite unnatural impulses."
2,Sherlock Holmes Collection Vol. 1,Collection of four Sherlock Holmes movies staring Basil Rathbone. I received four disks but two were the same movie and I was missing one. It just so happens I already owned the one that was missing so I didn't complain but it shows poor quality control.
5,The Sherlock Holmes,No one can play Sherlock Holmes like Basil Rathbone. Although these movies are set outside the original time period for Mr Holmes they are none the less excellent. The DVD format adds to the quality of these movies.
4,warpath,"warpath is an asome game.You can be 14 diffrent dinosaurs.My favorite dinosaur is mega raptor!The levels are from the movie one and two.Theres edable power ups like poeple ,comps,dogs,and goats.Theres a level were you can fight at univrsal theme park!This is a great game!"
4,One of the best fighting games I have played,"The first time I played this game I was hooked. It's easy to beat and I love the wounds and blood effect. If you set it to hard, its almost impossable to defeat your foes as they use multable combos, and I dont think a dinosaur could really fight that fast when it comes to using combos. This is a good game to rent, as you most likely wont be entertained by it for long."
4,Not that bad...,"Although it seems that many do not like this game, it is not that bad at all. It is an excellent game to play if you are bored, and there are cool features to unlock."
3,It's no Primal Rage. . .,"Primal Rage was the best dino-fighting game, period (although it didn't translate well to the home systems).The animation in this game is atrocious to say the least. The characters seem to snap back into their poses too quickly and awkwardly.The controls are pretty simple to use and moves are easy to execute. There are no fatalities, however, which I find a major drawback.Even though you can unlock new characters, it's not worth it. All of them are just carbon copies of the original ones you are given. The Megaraptor and Spinosaurus are identical right down to their fighting moves.It's still a fun game, but definately not one of the best."
2,exciting? no way!,this game is a mega bore and is not worth the money. if you like 1 on 1 battling games then spend your money on tekken
1,very pissed off,"okay so i ordered this game and the company claimed it was in good condition,got it with prime an it came in a day earlier then it said it wasgoing to an i was stoked! tried to play it. come to find out the outsideparts of the disk was in good condition but the very center of the disklooked like it had been circled a few time with a knife with some angerbehind it.... if you havn't guessed already,the shit DID NOT WORK!it freezes everytime i try to pick a dinosaur an thats if i even make itto the main screen to pick anything.over all i am OH SO VERY UNHAPPY!!!!! didnt even want to send it back or complane..ended up just ordering another one from a different company. wouldnt even bother withthis company... wouldnt trust it :/not happy with this product"
3,Okay...,"This game looks kinda cool, even though I never played it...It looks like a newer version of the classic Primal Rage I give it a 3 out of 5...I think I'll go and buy it."
2,Mathis Christmas effort,A couple of classics but the rest was just regular songs. Not a favorite CD- not his best effort. Bought two CDs of holiday music of Mathis and both were just OK
5,Love it,Great selection of music and extra special since I just saw Johnny in a concert. He is still singing great.
5,Miracles for Sunburns,I bought this ointment after becoming VERY sunburned on the lips from a trip to Vietnam.My dermatologist recommended it but after I healed; I continue to use it and not just on the lip but on hands as well as elbows.Great product!
5,Nice product!,"This product is very useful for Skin healing, and you cannot beat the price! Will definitely come back and buy again!"
4,Product Review,The product was excellent in preventing radiation treatment burns.The application is easy and the relief was almost instant. I highly recomend this productover other more greasy and hard to apply.
1,Don't Buy This! Some Tubes are Defective!,"I didn't notice until after I had opened the package that 2 of the 6 tubes can't be opened- the companies didn't separate the plastic lid from the rest of the cap! So basically those tubes were useless, and I couldn't return them. Buy your Aquaphor somewhere else."
1,DO NOT Waste Your Money!!!!,"Folks, the ""active ingredient"" in this crap is Petrolatum - basically, that's Vaseline Petroleum Jelly. And this junk contains 41% of it. Regular Vasoline Petroleum Jelly contains 100%. At less than 1/3 the price. So if you want to spent $6.00 on this vs. $1.50 on a Vasoline, please don't let me stop you, but I'm simply telling you basic science. The ""inactive"" ingredients include mineral oil and glycerin.This concoction is why pharmaceutical companies are despised around the world. Take $0.50 worth of Petroleum Jelly, throw in $0.02 cents worth of mineral oil and glycerin, and tout it as ""Advanced Therapy"".It's B.S. folks - pure and simple. Junk.Save yourselves some money and do yourselves a favor - but the cheapest Petroleum Jelly you can find; Vaseline or store brand."
2,Wanna Get Drunk?,"This product is ludicrous. It is a staggering 51% ALCOHOL! Then there is 191 mg of something called ""Fresh Oat Aerial Parts extract."" This burns as it goes down. It is the equivelant of a shot of Vodka. I can get a half pint and cure my stress REAL easy at the corner liquor store for a mere $4.99. So skip this."
4,Good Time Alt Pop,"Though the price is astronomical (sp?), Russel Simins' debut LP ""Public Places"" is a great cd. It's got a funky, summery sound to it, and some interesting experementation, that really works in an alt pop way. It's an essential for road trips, or any driving around with the windows rolled down. I'd recomend scowering the used bins at your record store: odds are, someone in your area's had it and it doesn't need to be imported from Asia."
3,Boppers vs. Coppers in a So-Bad-It's-Good Whopper!,"Daddy Arch Hall provided junior with the dead presidents for this DOA jd disaster. Showcasing sonny's nonexistent skills as an actor and singer/songwriter, this unintentional spoof sports a sixth-grade script and rum-dum direction. The VHS sleeve promises trampy babes, biker gang rumbles, and major racketeering. Instead, the flick has girl-next-door types, polo-shirted and even suit-clad teens in one hot rod and a chicken truck, and a fat slob and old geezer in a rundown car-parts lot. Corny social commentary and clueless cops complete the mix, making for a (truly) cheap thrills fun fest."
3,"Nice watch, wrist band difficult to release","This is a nice watch and fits great. I like the style and colors. the only problem is in the wrist band. there is a small button on the end of the band that fits into a small hole to hold the wrist band together. It is easy to clip on, but getting off with one had is very difficult. I have to pull very hard and nearly bruise my arm to release the button. I have to cut off the button so I don't go crazy each time I wear it."
2,"I HATE ""MADE IN CHINA""","Man, let me put it this way: what's the problem with these big offshore companies like Nike? I guess i have an answer for that: Everything they offer you is ""made in China""!Well, i'd be OK with that if the porducts made in China were good quality. But unfortunately, they are not. This watch is a very well-designed piece an it looks great, but the buttons and wristband feel like a cheap 5,00 U.S. Dollars watch (also made in China, of course).I think that every big company in the world, not only Nike, should start thinking over immediately about a big change in the production line, because I AM TIRED OF CHEAP GADGETS MADE IN CHINA. I mean it, STOP ""MADE IN CHINA"" PRODUCTS NOW, OR YOUR CUSTOMERS WILL START MAKING BETTER CHOICES FOR THEIR MONEY!"
5,CAPE MAY AT ITS BEST,THIS BOOK IS GREAT FOR ANYONE WHO ONLY THINKS OF CAPE MAY AS A SUMMER TOWN. THE MANY BEAUTIFUL PICTURES WILL SHOW JUST HOW WONDERFUL THIS BEAUTIFUL TOWN IS ALL THE TIME. MY ONLY WORRY IS THAT EVEN MORE PEOPLE WILL BE HERE AFTER SEEING THE TOWN IN ALL SEASONS.
4,Excellent,"This is a super camera bag. It is small and roomy; holds the camera, extra batteries, memory cards, and the small tripod. It is durable and packs easily. I bought one for myself, one for my daughter, and recommended to our friends. This is just the thing if you do not want a bulky bag."
4,Canon Camera case,"The case is a little small if you want to fit anything more than the camera, one memory card and a few batteries. It works just fine for that. However, we wanted something a little larger to carry extra memory and the batteries with the charger. We ended up returning the case and ordering the 5694 instead. It was actually a few dollars less than the 5692 at the time.Both cases are sturdy and well made. The materials and padding are excellent and will protect a camera from almost any damage. By the by, we're using the case with a Canon A710."
5,Great Fit For Canon A630,"Bought this for my mom's first digital camera, a Canon A630. The camera fits like it was made for the bag. The bag has a high quality feel. It snaps shut and also uses velcro which is nice if you're constantly taking it in and out of the case. The padding inside the case is very reassuring. You won't worry about dropping the case and breaking the camera. You can easily fit 4 replacement AA batteries in a front zip pocket. You could fit an additional 4 AA (for a total of 8) in the memory card pocket if you had to. I'd buy this or another Tamrac product again without hesitation."
3,Not customized for the G10,"The Tamrac web site recommends the 5692 case for the Canon ""G-series"" so I bought it for my G10. At the time, I did not pay attention to the front pocket which can carry 4 AA batteries. The G10 does not use AA batteries so this pocket just takes extra space. I sometime use it to carry my Blackberry Curve and it makes the case much bulkier. Also, if one has a strap attached to the camera, the case's strap is redundant.Tamrac has since developed a new case specifically for the G9/G10 (model 5689). For those of you who prefer a tight and compact fit, the 5689 may be a better option however it does not have an extra opening for the other end of the camera strap.I finally bought the Canon PSC-5100 case and it was a perfect fit. It allows one to carry the camera horizontally by the strap or via the belt sleeve and be able to pull the camera out quickly when needed."
5,Nice case for Lumix LX-5,"This is the best case I've found so far for my Panasonic Lumix LX-5. It hold the camera snugly but not too tightly, there is room left over for memory cards and a spare battery. I think it is a little too large to hang off your belt (though it does have a belt loop), but you can use the shoulder strap just fine. I would highly recommend this case for any camera the size of an LX-5."
1,Painful and inhumane,"I raise show rabbits, and I want to comment on the review that says it doesn't hurt them at all. Well it does. They're getting tons of needles jabbed through their ear, and often squeal and jump wildly in pain immediately when you clamp it and are very stressed afterward. I've even heard of rabbits that have broken their backs from thrashing in pain. This type of tattooing is extremely imhumane, and you should use a tattoo PEN. They don't hurt the rabbit nearly as much. That's how I've had most of my rabbits done, and they seemed to barely experience any pain from it. The few early on that I got done with this type of clamp tattooer squealed loudly and thrashed trying to escape the handler. They were clearly in pain. That's why I started getting them done with tattoo pens, and they don't love it, but the reaction is much less violent."
1,Not sure,"I don't even know how to brand a rabbit but just looking at it look extremely cruel! How would you like to be ""tattooed"" with it?"
2,nutritionalSupplements.com bible,"This book is definitely NOT worth the $. It has opinions of readers without concrete scientific facts, or even names to back up what they say. It is like being in a chat room. You really do not know what you are getting. I am angry as I blew $30 on a book that should be priced in the $9 range. My favorite supplement book was written by The EAS founder, Bill Phillips."
1,Don't buy this book,Without a doubt this is the biggest piece of junk I have even bought.Totally worthless info.Presentation is a question and answer forum.Junk.
2,Tiny stick,"This may be a very good product but I used half of it the first time I used it. It seems like it should be much larger to be able to use it for more than a few times. Also, the stick slides up and you have to use your finger to keep it slid up or when you put it on the stick slides down and won't go on. I'm not impressed."
2,I was disappointed,"First of all, the tube was much smaller than I thought it would be. The product that you push up to put on your foot is very soft so while you are applying it you have the problem of it smearing all over the tube and your hand. I'm not saying that it doesn't work. It does work. It's just a mess to apply. The reason I decided to get a solid to apply to my feet was because I didn't want to have to apply anything with my hands. This did not solve that problem. Actually, it's messier than if you just use a cream or salve out of a squeeze tube."
1,Heeltastic doesn't work,"I don't know if this is the same heeltastic that is advertised on TV, but I got myheeltastic (as seen on tv) at Wallmart for about $11. It made my heels worst and left a dark crust instead. The stick itself is very oily and melts as you use it. I was able to return it for a full refund with my receipt at hand. Don't be fooled by these infomercials that promise you the moon.... This product DOES NOT WORK and in fact makes your dry heels worst. Save your money."
2,foot,If you are really serious then go see a podiatrist instead. get some real medicine if you want results
4,As advertised,"Product is as advertised. Seems pricy, but what are you gonna do? If you need it you need it. It was easyo to install and its easy to use. No issues here."
3,Principles of Macroeconomics,This book crams a lot of terminology into each chapter. This is the 6th Edition and is not the edition I wanted. It was not obvious which edition I was ordering.
4,"Good, but they should've moved Start and Select up a little.","Playstation's Dual Shock is such a comfortable and popular layout that PC gamepad companies like Saitek and Logitech try to copy it, and they usually don't do a very good job. Their d-pads are always too awkward, or their construction is too lightweight. The Dual Shock is solid and is built to last. I'm an emulation gamer, and thanks to SmartJoy's USB adapter I can use a real PS1/PS2 gamepad with ZSNES and Bleem.My only gripes with the pad: A) The Start/Select buttons really should've been moved up after the addition of analog sticks. I'm always finding myself fumbling over the sticks trying to get to Start and Select. B) While the d-pad is very sturdy, it kills my thumbs after a couple hours of play. Kinda makes me wish they had taken a Turbo Touch 360 approach and used a touch-sensitive panel instead of hard plastic arrows."
4,all right,"Well I lost two of my RSJ cd's and so I got this single until I buy back the cd's that I lost. So that's why I got this cd. I like the songs. Wait for me is very pop/rock and song is love tends to lean more towards rock. Wait for me is about saving yourself for your husband and remaining a virgin until marriage, while song of love is a song about worshipping God.The only question that I have is..why did the label release the cd single after the two albums came out already? Why didn't they release the cd single first and then the albums? It seems to me as if CCM has got everything backwards. So that's my only complaint, I like the songs.The back of the cd says that its enhanced but when I put it in my cd-rom all it popped up was a link to the official RSJ website. *sigh* If you've got the albums don't buy the single."
2,Not for large chewers,Our 11 month old Dalmatian had already chewed through the rope and canvas in 15 minutes. Not meant for young chewers. It would be a great toy for fetching with a dog out of the pupp stage.
5,Saved my breasfeeding!!,"My daughter spent the first three weeks of her life in the NICU and if it weren't for this breast pump, I wouldn't have been able to breastfeed her (she's 11 months old now and we're still going strong). I tried a couple of other pumps, but they weren't able to stimulate enough milk production. After buying this pump, I was able to pump up to eight ounces every three hours! Because it has a battery pack, I was also able to take it along and pump in the car and at our family's houses when we went for visits. It comes with a portable cooler which I used to transport my fresh and frozen milk to the hospital daily. What a lifesaver! :)"
2,"Good, but could be better","I used this pump a lot at first because my son was premature and in NICU. I had to use it strictly because he couldn't breastfeed at breast.It was great at first, but now the suction is not that great as it once was. Too expensive not to work well. Go for hospital grade instead if pumping frequently."
3,"before you buy an expensive pump, get a $20 manual one first","After I spent all that money, I was told that some women can't pump too much even though they produce a lot of milk. Of course just to make me angry, I wasn't pumping much (even though I am making enough milk). That is why i recommend that before you buy such an expensive pump, try to use a cheap manual pump to see how it works first."
5,worth the money,"we purchased the pump in style on a lactation specialist's recommendation so that i could return to work and continue breastfeeding exclusively. my baby is over 5 months old now and is in the 99th percentile of height and weight. the pump works quickly and is easy to use, and has helped maintain my milk supply and provide the baby with food while i work. it is worth the money when you consider its ease of operation (and when you consider the cost of formula!!!)"
5,Couldn't have survived without it,"I actually borrowed this pump from a friend after debating whether or not I needed one. I was going to buy an inexpensive manual. I would not have survived! I woke up very very engorged on the fourth day and the pump saved me. I was able to pump 8 ounces within 15 minutes. If I have another baby, I would buy this pump. It is worth every penny.A previous reviewer commented that you cannot buy replacement parts. The Medela website sells all parts and the prices and shipping are reasonable. Their customer service is excellent as well. As a thank you for the person I borrowed from, I got all new pieces for her when I returned the pump (and she was again pregnant) for about $35."
3,Kinda short...,"A very attractive book, but covers only a few moves. (Forward/backward rolls, cartwheels, round-offs, back walk-overs, back handsprings, and handstands.) Not really useful for a girl wanting practical tips. Other apparatus (bars/beam/vault) are barely touched on."
5,A Really Good Book for Beginning Gymnasts,"This is one of the best books on gymnastics I have read. It has pictures that show people how to do the move, and it starts with really simple tricks and moves on to the most difficult trick in the book- a backhandspring. It also has parts on sports acrobatics and rythmic gymnastics. It's a great book, but I would recommend it to beginning gymnasts."
2,WHY WHY WHY!,"This game is terrible! I cant believe EA tried to make this game. First of all the conrol is aweful, terrible. I mean the moves are really hard to pull off. The graphics are OK but they could of been alot better. They were poorly done. They are way to short. Now lets talk about the gameplay. Well lets start with the create a player mode. I have one word to describe this mode. The loading times are really slow. I mean whatever I do it loads. Its also way to short. You can hardly chose anything. Well maybe the best part of the game is the soundtrack. The commentary is pretty good. And the cheers and the grunts makes you think you are right at the match! But with the poor graphics and bad gameplay makes you think you are at a circus. If you are looking for a good wrestling game get wwf attitude or wait for wwf smackdown to come out. But im warning you whatever you do DONT GET THIS GAME!"
2,Not that great,"I bought this for my 7 year old son and he played it for about 7 minutes before tossing it into the ""games he never plays"" box. Not only are most of the fighters out dated but it was hard for him to even figure out how to use 2 player mode, he thought it was 1 player only until I read the instructions on how to access the 2 player mode. He is usually very quick to pick up on how to play a game but this one was set up in a dumb manner. Also, the announcers are annoying and keep saying the same thing over and over. Even though it was very cheap it still was not even worth it."
1,THIS GAME SUCKS!,"This game is no fun. First af all the loading times are horrible. I dont even know why they even put a create a player mode in the game because, it really sucks! The control is really bad. Each wrestle has only a few moves that are hard to pull off. The graphics are pure crap! The only thing that was decent was the sound track. I hate to say this but this game is the worst wrestling game ever. Dont even rent this game because its a waste of money. If you are looking for a good wrestling game, get wwf attitude."
3,Weird,"OK, let me start with the things that unsatisfied me. First, the game's graphic is really bad, specially when you are outside the ring, close to the ropes. For the create-a-wrestler mode, you can't combine your own moves. The wrestlers do not talk. My created wrestler's entrance got stuck so I had to restart my PSX.Good things about it, good gameplay, moves are easy to be executed. They look cool, but the chokeslam look so dumb, the entrances of the wrestlers are quite cool. The weapons are cool. Backstage arenas are also great. The commentators are great. A lot better than WCW Nitro and Thunder and of course WWF Attitude.So if you wanna buy this game, consider these!"
4,Good drama inside.,I discovered some fine plays that I had never even heard of and some that are old favorites. This book is definitely valuable for the drama aficionado.
3,Not the Best,"I love this musical, and any soundtrack from it is amazing. however, if you're having difficulty picking which version, i would suggest the movie soundtrack before this one. Judus is no where near as good, which was a dissapointment. however, the songs were still very good. What else can Andrew LLoyd Webber be?"
5,"final fantasy anthology, awesomeness","If you're looking at this game, you've probably already played it, both five and six of the final fantasy series, so not much needs to be said about how great they are. Or how much time you'll be devoting to these two great games. They are some of the best examples of the series and will captivate you with their stories and gameplay.The added CGI scenes that most players have become accustomed to since final fantasy seven are a great treat as well to complement these two timeless video game treasures.Simply put, with this, you won't be disappointed."
4,final fantasy anthology,this is a really good classic game that takes me back to my childhood and im glad that i made this purchase
3,There are much better versions of these games out there...,"Yes, you could buy this collection of FF 5 and 6, or you could buy the gameboy advance versions. I owned this for ps1 and the load times going fromt the overworld to the status menu put me to sleep. I really do like these two games, but they play so much better on the GBA than the PS1. Unless you can't find a gba, gba sp, gb micro, or even a gb player addon for a gamecube, then i'd say buy this. If there's one thing i can't stand, it's a good cartridge game being ported to a system that makes the experience dull and boring."
3,old school gaming...,Classic titles at good prices and fast deliver all that was missing was the cellophane wrapping and the new game smell...I was pleased and still am!!!
5,The #1 RPG's,"I find Final Fantasy Anthology one of the best RPG's that could ever be released. Final Fantasy V lacks the character development but it really gets me into it with the job system. Final Fantasy VI has one of the greatest story lines in any game I've ever seen, and with 14 characters yours always going to try to spend time with all your characters to progress with the story and just to have 14 very strong characters. I like the esper system much more than just buying magic, this game puts your strategic skills to the test."
4,Final Fantasy Anthology,"Final Fantasy Anthology is one of the best games I have ever played. Any game with Magic is a game for me! It has Espers and monsters that you can fight and collect! If your like me, this game is for you!"
4,great example of an set of old squaresoft games,A great game if you have the patience. i gave it four stars for the reason that ff5 just is not nearly as good as ff6. Don't get me wrong its very good but it just does not seem fitting to go with ff6. It would have been much better if ff3(nes) was with it but sadly it is not. While ff6 is a great game a very complex story two halves of it before the end of the world and after it. The gameplay is great. The graphics falter in comparison of newer games but are great for those such as myself who mainly plays old final fantasy games as rpgs. i would recomend this set to anyone who has an interest in olf ff games.
1,Loading Times and Boringness Galore,"Final Fantasy VI is a very good game, however its story is boring at times and charecters remain very underdeveloped throughout the story. The magic system is good, however the loading times produced by the PlayStation are deadly. If you really want to play this game - play it as it was meant to be on Super Nintendo.Final Fantasy V wasnt released in the United States because it was too ""weird"" and ""complex"" for american gamers according to SquareSoft producers. Well, i'd have to concur with them in that the Job system is good if you plan on spending more time configuring your chars than playing. The story is pretty entertaining, but the graphics are getting pretty dated."
2,Where is Final Fantasy 6?,"Where is Final Fantasy 6? It only came with 5. Also five doesn't work well. It freezes, graphics mess up and music lags. Horrible product and even worse missing an item!"
1,I'm sorry...it SUCKED!,I'm sorry.... this game SUCKED! No graphics...nostoryline...nothing!...FF7&FF8 were the best gamesever... Everyone... buy FF7 or FF8...I liked 'em both. I was soooo addiected to both gamnes...it will leave you playing untill dawn. Anthology...it isn't worth the money at all at all.Maybe cuz I played 8 & 7 first.
1,Bait and Switch,"I am unfamiliar with this relm of video game play so I believed that the animation would be as pictured on the inside cover and in the game preview. But the game itself was the flat choppy animation of the Atari game era, not the 3-D animation of today's games, or of that in this game's preview. I did not enjoy it. I didn't care for the bait and switch."
3,I'd rather play an emulator,"When playing this game I received a LOT of lag between just opening the menu and entering combat. Where-as with the traditional SNES, or with a computer, the loading times for these are INSTANT. The loading lag i received was at least 2-3 seconds almost per opening the menu and going into combat. Overall I would not recommend getting this to try and quench your oldskool RPG munchies. Try an emulator instead."
4,"Gamers get two of the deepest, greatest RPGs ever created","Gamers get two of the deepest, greatest RPGs ever created for less than the price of a single new game - it's hard to argue with that sort of value. Whether you've waited five years for Final Fantasy V or just finished your first Final Fantasy, the Final Fantasy Anthology is sure to entertain. Jody Bissoon"
4,Lifelong RPG fan,"Having grown up on Nintendo <8 bit> and Super Nintendo, I loved the RPGs when they came out, because they were usually few and far between <but always good when they came out>. The Dragon Warrior Series, Secret of Mana, and the FF series were always a good bet, and I LOVED FF III on the SuperNintendo. Upon hearing about it being released for the PSX, I grabbed it ASAP. I don't care a whole lot for FF 5 - in a era of digitized graphics and sound effects, it isn't as good, plus I do not care much for the ability to chance classes. FF VI is a wonderful remake of the Super Nintendo version, and I LOVE the added additions of a gallery and a beastiary. It would have been nice to add the character's songs in the CD <Gau's song and Celes's song in particular> but I won't nitpick. This is one of those games that I spend all night playing, and then some. To get on idea of how much I love FF VI, I use it as a compasion to other RPGs. I view this as the best RPG I have ever played."
3,ehh..........,"Well...I expected more from this game. FYI Final Fantasy V is a hard game compared to the other Final Fantasy games. FFA isn't the best, but I guess it's worth trying. If you're going to buy it play FF6 first. If you're lookin' to play any old revised game, I suggest Lunar: The Silver Star Story. Buy this game if you like to level up characters (in the game) at ridiculously high levels, or looking for a hard game to play (FF5)."
4,The unfortunate American market,"I am not giving 5 stars to this game simply on the principle that, after waiting eagerly for it to be released in America, I was disappointed to find they had not bothered to include FF4 like they had done in the original Japanese release. (FF2 for the American crowd out there... oh and btw, this is for the person who said that it was weird for them to rename FF3 to FF6, there _was_ 6 Final Fantasy titles in Japan before the widely known 7 and now 8, they were just not all translated because of the lack of market in the US)These games are amazing, if only for the nostalgic who can now indulge in the luscious CG added for the re-release."
5,Simply..... Awsome ..,"FFVI is by far the the best game i have played. Its Grpahics may not be that great, but for what it lacks in that it makes up for in Plot, the characters(backrounds, individual personality, abilities, and the story that unfolds about each character as the game progresses), battle and items. Its everything an rpg should be full of .. comedy, action, adventure, battling, plot twists, and (of course) fantasy.Ive played only alittle bit of FFV and i havent really liked it .. the graphics arent that hot either but it did come from snes like FFVI, but the charcters lacked something ... i cant tell what though.All in all a this is a must have or would make a great present for some rpg lover in your life. It ranks my no.1 choice for favorite game next to Lunar2: Eternal Blue."
4,FF V and FFVI,"This game is a remake of the snes hits. The story line for the FFVI is really good. The biggest problems are that like most of the FF games, you need to spend to much time near the end of the game to level up so that you can stand a chance. The other problem is that the game can be very slow when moving from screen to screen."
2,NOISE,I am not at all happy with this sump pump...it makes a LOT more NOISE than my 15 year old one!!!
2,These are terrible!,I love raspberry and chocolate and was very excited to find a healthy alternative for my brownie fix. I was sorely disappointed in the taste. The raspberry flavor is overpowering and tastes so artificial we didn't even eat the whole pan. The texture of the brownies and the ease of prep is terrific but this particular flavor is awful.
3,too sweet,"Although these are fat free, they were much to sweet to my taste. Sugar can be just as bad as fat for you... but for being fat free, they are good for those of us who get an hunger attack for something wont make you feel TOO guilty. I can only take it in very small portions because of its sugar content."
2,Misleading Description on staples,"When I purchased these staples, the description on the AMAZON page said ""4 Pack of US12G 1/2L 3/8CRN UPHOL STAPLE"". I ordered two of these FOUR packs. However, this is not what I recieved. I recieved two individual packs. I contacted the seller and they told me sorry for the mistake but that they had reported this issue to AMAZON regarding the description. However, I already had ordered and paid for them and all they were willing to do was take care of the shipping so that I could order two more packs. I felt mislead and was very disappointed."
5,Great diaper rash PREVENTER,"They used this on my son in the hospital when he was 5 weeks old. I found it here on Amazon, and bought some. I apply it to the ""diaper area"" with every diaper change. My son is 4-1/2 months and hasn't had any signs of diaper rash since. And it's so cheap!"
4,lid to tinny,"The product is just great for baby diaper rash... but when you are changing your baby it's very dangerous to have the tinny lid around it! it get lost very easly and you don't want to get it lost in your baby's mouth, do you! I end up buying the same product but the 1lb big potA and D original ointment jar diaper rash and all-purpose skincare formula by fougera - 1 lb"
4,LOVE it but HATE the cap,"I got it first from the hospital where my daughter was born. She's now 6 months old and NEVER had any diaper rash! It works so much better than those fancy packaged baby diaper creams. The only thing I dislike about it is the cap, its hard to screw back on and if you lose it, you will find ointment all over the places."
5,review of interactive pathology c.d rom,"Interactive Pathology is an intelligent interactive computerized pathology source. It makes looking up disorders and physical problems fun to find. There are other sources such as current drugs, illustrations that connect with the various disorders. Other medical and health care professionals would benefit from this c.d. as well as massage therapists. Obviously, this is the wave of the future in education technology. Interactive pathology is well researched and professionally presented. You can retrieve information readily and print out for yourself and clients. Don't be surprised if time flys when you are enjoying your search."
3,southernliving cookbook from the food staff at southernlivi,"I think this is a nice basic cookbook, but If you have a lot of cook books, you will fined a lot of recipes in this cookbook you already have in other cookbooks. I also own a copy of the Southern living ultimate cookbook, I LOVE this cookbook."
5,Not just a cookbook!,"This is not just a great cookbook, but it's also a great kitchen reference book! It helps with measurements, table etiquette, food storage and anything else you can think of. It doesn't just tell you what to do but how to do it. With this book, I don't have to call my mom for all my questions anymore."
4,Expensive through Amazon,"This product is great, but I paid about the same buying this from Henrys' and it had 100 FL oz as opposed to just 32...Not worth buying this online. Also...if your local store doesn't carry it, often times they can special order it."
1,Hate it!,"My 6 month old got this for Christmas and I HATE IT! I'm all for creativity, but not at this age. The story is a nice concept, but not implemented very well. A fish with fingers? What does that have to do with the fur? It's almost like they picked out the circles of touchy feely stuff for the book and struggled to write the story around them."
3,Silly Millie,"There are dozens of good animal touch and feel books on the market, suitable for toddlers; Millie Moo is not one that I would recommend for them. While this colorful book is full of surprises, most would tend to be confusing for kids who cannot yet discriminate among animals. Fish do not have fingers, for example, nor are pandas polka dotted. For older members of the preschool set, however, Millie and her out of the ordinary friends would provide many opportunities for fun and silly reading enjoyment."
4,all I can say is amazing,"I went and saw the hives last tuesday and to my surprise there was an amazing opening band called the pattern. I was stunned for I had never heard them before. I enjoyed their performence so much they had wonderful stage presents and the lead singer oh my goodness he was a beautiful creature. The music just made me dance till I could not dance any more. If you are looking for a new band to listen to, pick up the patterns cd it shall not disappoint."
4,You can see the Stooges inspiration,"The Pattern sounds like a punkier version of the Strokes, with much more snottier vocals. This cd is great if you're into the sudden burst of garage punk bands (like I am). I would reccomend you buys this if you like the Strokes, or are looking for a new band with lots of energy."
4,Entirely Riveting,"Someone needs to stop by Matthew Ryan's house and make sure he's all right. Check his pulse, remove all sharp objects from the kitchen and power tools from the shed. The only word I can think of to describe his 3rd album is sorrowful. This is an album of extreme quiet, desperation, and sadness. Many of the tracks are simply Ryan playing a very sparse acoustic guitar and singing the lyrics in a half asleep rumble. The amazing thing is, it works. Ryan sings with such hopeless despair, I find myself drawn down into the music and seperated from the real world. This is the album Bruce Springsteen failed to make with ""The Ghost of Tom Joad"". It's a courageous album because it is entirely uncommercial, but entirely riveting."
1,National texture-knit crew neck,"This top is really cute and fits according to size. The problem is that the bottom part of the top stretches out immediately after putting it on. Instead of fitting like the picture, it just hangs straight down. It does not hug your hips as seen in the picture. I returned mine, and after shipping I only got $8 credit!!!"
2,Not really that good!,"I have struggled to keep reading this series. I find that there are a lot of words that really don't go anywhere. How long do I need to read this before SOMETHING is done along the main storyline?? Yeah, the romans are great warriors in this new world even though they don't use MAGIC OR CAVALRY. I want to believe!! I enjoy the roman experience. The reason I started this series is because of the HBO series ROME. That is probably the underlying reason why I don't really care for it.... To high expectations!"
4,Amazing performance of the opera on one disc!,"Lovely recording of the Handel work and the players give a brisk and moving sound to the numbers. The cast is light with four singers and only these four make the chorus as well as the characters, which sounds like more of a consort than a opera chorus. Four more singers would have made the chorus stand out better for the opera. Touching plot of simple pastoral lovers threatened by a rival giant. The lamenting chorus with Galatea give much light as she weeps at Acis' tragic loss. And calling it a masque is too small for this fine piece; it is an opera."
3,I was unimpressed,"I should commend the Scholars Baroque Ensemble for the work they are doing in popularising early music at a price most people can afford. Yet don't be mistaken: what is budget-priced is budget-quality. The in-house singers are not the greatest, especially as compared to the star-studded performances of other Handel operas and oratorios which are currently available. Unless you have a particular reason to own this recording, or can't afford anything else, I would not recommend it. If you can own only one Handel recording, I would suggest a recent recording of oratorio Esther, directed by Christophers."
3,A bit of a disappointment.,"I'm a huge fan of attacktix, so I too was excited to order the battle case. However, the rules included for the capture the flag game seem incomplete and you will find yourself having to make up all sorts of house rules to make a smooth gameplay. The turret the case comes with has no instructions at all, so you have to make up what you'll do with it. Also, while the promo pictures have you believe the case is painted, it is NOT. It is all black plastic. Because of the unfilled, unpainted grooves on the surface of the case, it's even hard to move your figures to make the important 'tix'.Some good things:-the figures snap inside the case very well. In fact, my stored figures look just like the promo pictures.-the clone trooper it comes with is an excellent additional figure with a great special power. He's also green and very cool! Probably the best clone trooper available for the game.-if you have more than one battle case gameplay is much more fun (although expensive!)"
2,Star Wars Attacktix Battle Case,"This case was impossible to find in stores. I was so happy when I found it on amazon... however, I was disappointed when I received it. I enjoy playing the game with my 5 year old son and this did not increase my enjoyment of the game. In order to effectively use these for game play, you would need to purchase at least two for each person. You could buy a lot more figures for that price. Some of the figures are too tall to display with another figure above them. It would take about 4 cases to display a complete set of figures."
3,alittle rice for what you get,The price of this item was a little high for what you get. The case was flimsey. The darts fall out of the storage area when you carry it. The double shot cannon has no value/use in the game. You have to have aleast two cases to use the stands that come with it. These extra parts just drive the cost up and have no real purpose in the context of the game.
3,Great at 4 bucks!!,"While this item was wildly overpriced when it first came out and suffers from serious design flaws, it is a must buy at 4 dollars.It comes with an excellant clone character.It adds a new dimemsion to Attacktix, capture the flag game.For me and my son (5) it inspired all sorts of arena building.You get an extra gun to use as you see fit (no rules).The display/storage function works well.Negative are the poor design. the pieces don't stack as they should so we are constantly repositioning the cases. The plastic is very slick and rolling figures sometimes don't click.Bottom line a good buy at 4 dollars. I would suggest getting 3 or more as they are stackable and you can arrange them in a pyramid arraingement. (BTW, they do not lock together next to each other which I believe is another flaw.)PS Looks like the price is back up to 21 dollars. Save your money. Not worth it."
4,What I did with my cases.,"I bought two cases and I enjoy them. I can fit Darth Sidious(S2), Darth Maul(S2), 3 Royal Guards(S2), 5 Jedi Knights(S2), Mace Windu(S2 starter), and Obi-wan Kenobi(S3) in one case. But I have to put Sidious, Maul, and Obi-Wan at the bottom.I have a few figures that don't fit but the majority do.(I have about 50 figures.)And sometimes I put the figure in backwards or with shooters I stick their weapon between the figures above.I have problems with the ""tix"" sometimes but I usually just guess how many, if I know I can make it with some to spare, and then move the wheel with my finger.Overall I find the battle case to be an exellent addition to the battle field as it adds new ways to play."
3,Not worth the frustration,My problems with this toy are;* That it is expensive and not practical.* There are a lot of figures that do not fit in a way to allow the case to close and some with lightsabres do not allow four across* The turrent seems to be only good for extra missles for the other figures* Gameplay with this does not work well any way I tried itThings I like about it;* Figure is cool with good power* Concept is good and if I bought about 10 it would hold my sons figuresGet it on clearance as it is $19.99 locally for meLove the game - hate the case
1,This was horrible!,"We love Attactix. Our children love Attactix, so they were pretty excited about getting two battle cases for their birthdays. It was flimsy and was poorly constructed. It couldn't hold hardly any of our figures as they are too large to fit properly inside it. We returned both cases immediately and bought more figures and a rubbermaid storage box."
3,2 Great Songs Missing,"It's a pity that ""Seven Lonely Days"" and ""Kiss Me Another"" do not appear in this item. These two songs are best known in Thailand."
4,Works well,"Works well with the old blender. Waited a little longer to get these, but it was well worth it. The old Oserizer never worked better."
5,Blender gasket seals,Awhile ago I used to purchase the replacement rubber o-ring gasket seals for my Oster blenders at the Hardware store. Now they don't sell them any more. So I was thrilled to be able to get a package of 3 at Amazon cheaply and quickly. Now I have replaced the old ones in my 2 blenders with one in reserve. And no more leakage.
4,Cool there OEM size,the right size and shape mabey 3/32 too spongey (probably because there new) but there great replacement parts to have on hand.
4,Everyone needs some new gaskets,"These gaskets for the Oster ""Beehive"" blender base should be replaced when they start to get stiff. Can cause leaking at blender base.Regarding the Vendor, first set of three gaskets did not arrive and they did not have a tracking number. When I e-mailed them about not receiving, they FedEx ed another three immediately, so they were responsive."
4,Shipped to fried,"It was a gift for a friend, they got married, and we shipped it there so I never saw the gift. But I have no reason to think that excellent service was not provided."
5,Pleased,I got this item so I would have spare parts on hand. I use the Olster Kitchen Center all the time. It is a good kitchen item that is used for a lot of kitchen duities.
4,O Rings - What's to Say?,"I suppose I'm being a bit unkind in giving a rating of four stars instead of five, but I just have trouble giving a rating of ""I love it"" to a delivery of o-ring gasket seals for a blender. On the plus side: the delivery was quick, the price was reasonable, and my blender didn't explode when I used my first gasket. On the negative side: umm... No negatives, other than it being a rather driver* purchase.*I use the term ""driver"" in lieu of ""pedestrian."" Since one gets a better sense of his or her surroundings when walking than one does when driving, and since walking is healthier and better for the environment than driving, I believe that ""driver"" is a better synonym for ""banal"" than ""pedestrian."" Automakers or Big Oil must have been the first ones to coin the word ""pedestrian"" as a term for the dull or uninteresting."
5,"nice, cheap and ships free",It took just a few days to get the 3 gaskets since they ship in a 1st class envelope. They're just the same as the one which came with my new blender and for $3 for 3 pcs. I can't complain!
5,what a wonderful gift.,"Had a 10 year old unit which had started leaking, while looking for a replacement found this gasket offer. Ordered this amazing so easy to remove and install. I have a brand new unit and works like new again. Had to add oil to the head as there was rust after 10 years of abuse , that made it run faster."
5,Just what I needed,This is a great way to extend the life of your blender. The old gasket wears out & using a new one really makes a difference.
3,O rings,"These seem to be after markets. They have a rubber smell to them which has transfered to the blender cup I use for my morning drink.They are rough in texture and not near the quality of OEM.They work the way their supposed to, but not sure of the longevity.They came within a few days of ordering."
3,"These are rubber, I don't know why I thought they'd be really sturdy","These are rubber so you have to make sure you have them on correctly when operating the blender, if they get on wrong, they could get caught in the blade and snap really easily. I thought they'd be sturdy, but the new blenders don't have sturdy materials anymore. I bought an old version of the Oster blender 10 speed on ebay from the 1980s and am going to use these pieces in case something screws up."
4,Works and fits,We have a bar type and quality old fashion single toggle Osterizer mixer for 15 years. The new ring worked great and is..... as advertised.
4,Fast delivery -- But are they food grade rubber?,"Pros:-- Product was inexpensive, cheaper than all others including shipping. I got 3 for the price of 1 with others.-- Shipped quickly. O-Rings arrived in regular mail in 5 days of purchase.-- They fit well and seem durable.Cons:-- Arrived in an envelope with no information or return address...and no packaging...which leads me to wonder, are they made of food-grade rubber??"
3,Rubber o-ring gasket seal for Oster & Osterizer,"I think the idea of the o-ring is good. The ones I ordered did not fit my Osterizer and thus I had to buy a new Osterizer. I don't believe one size will fit all, even though it was supposed to do so."
5,The three rubber gaskets,Hey..it's a rubber gasket set for a blender..no one' going to write a book or make a movie about it !
4,As Expected,"Sure, at three for a penny, the quality may not appear to be as good as the original that came with the blender, but it does its job well. It's well worth it even if each gasket lasts half as much as the original."
5,HARD TO FIND ITEM,I was so glad to find these gaskets. Ther are impossible to find locally in our area.Quick delivery and great price too.
1,Delivery Charges not refunded.,"I cancelled the item and the company acknowledged via email, but sent it anyway, 3 days later. Several days later I received the box and returned, unopened. The company only credited me back for the item, not the delivery."
5,One for the ages,"Here is a monster recording, one for the ages. The opening of the fourth movement is surely one of the great iconic (and iconoclastic!) masterpieces of recorded music - quintessential Beecham, massive, ironic, and great fun."
5,american electronic catching up,"this album impressed me more than i expected. great beats and random noises, following the vein of aphex or u-ziq."
5,420,"MP3.com artist Transient (Philadelphia) has taken one small slice of time out of his landslide of tracking and compiled his debut cd, a free-flowing barrage of over-the-top uptempo atmospheric beatery that rivals the precision and song structure of the best, then runs out of breath over halfway through and heads for the couch for some 420 action, carrying a theme of personal freedom and oneness with nature."
3,Kids like it but....,Was ok but one of those novelty items that kids watched once and could care less about watching again. They love Mario but this DVD was below avg
5,"If they love Mario games, try Mario on DVD!","The price can't be beat and my young Mario fan gives it his seal of approval. Nice idea for a small gift or ""prize box"" reward for elementary aged kids."
4,Good buy for Super Mario fans,"My kids like it. If they love Mario, they'll like this DVD. As an adult, I find the singing and voice of Yoshi to be horribly annoying. But my kids, especially my 2 yr old, like it. So, it was worth buying."
1,not a game,thought it was a game not what i wanted gave it to my friend for there kids they loved it
3,Classic Mario,"My 6 year old has become fascinated by everything Mario due to playing Super Mario Bros on the Wii. Overall she and her 4 year old sister like these videos and request them quite often. The videos are kind of old school compared to today's kid's fare. The characters don't set the best examples and the story lines are pretty much mush. However, they are entertaining if you order them knowing what to expect - typical 90's action cartoons."
5,A Must Have ! ! !,"I'm not a big fan of lick and pattern books, but this one has my seal of approval... and more than that, I HIGHLY reccomend it. There are lot's of ideas in here, some powerful stuff. Really hands on Jazz language material, some that if you're a more experienced improviser you might be using instinctively already, and some you wonder why you haven't touched on all along. The idea is to take them and build upon them... Within hours of getting the book, I immediately tuned out the outside world and was having fun experimenting with it... Some other things I like about it : The licks are in more than one key, suggested fingerings for more difficult ones, they're over a nice variety of patterns, typography is nice, and they're stuff that real people actually play, not just text book prototypes.I venture to say, that of the books I'm familiar with, this is the best one out !!! Great stuff for professionals as well as folks just getting into improv... and not just for pianists !"
4,"Very good resource, but . . .","The only reason for the ""but"" is that I think a lot of people buy these books thinking that they can quickly and easily transform their playing--and the language that the marketers use encourages that delusion. Serious musicians know that there is no quick and easy way to transform your playing.Having said all that, let me hasten to add that this particular book is a lot more useful than most. If you have the self-discipline to sit and WORK with this book, and if you are in a band or bands that provide you with opportunities to play with others, you will become a more fluent improviser. (If you're not in a band, get in one, even if you feel like you aren't ready. It's the only way you'll learn to play this music, and for most of us, it's the only way to get deep satisfaction as a musician.)"
3,"Good for Beginners, Intermediates...","These ""runs"" are just short phrases that any serious jazz musician already knows, or can easily conceive on his/her own. For a beginning jazz improviser this book will be helpful, but for any experienced player the material is uninspiring. They do provide good material for sight-reading. Much of the language is simplistic so if you are looking to expand your harmonic knowledge this book will not help you. I would (and have) recommended this book for my students."
3,Boring,"Another book that attempts to look inside you to improve your skiing. Not too effective, but there is a great section on learning how to ski moguls surprisingly. Read this section if you're interested in skiing moguls, but skip the other chapters."
5,INGREDIENTS IS A RIOT!,"It's about time somebody came up with a good novelty song! I couldn't believe it when I heard it the first time. Barenaked Ladies meets They Might Be Giants... definitely a hoot. The other songs are great, too."
2,"A concise, but splendid history of Gettysburg","Carl Smith's first book for Osprey Military is a winner. The book, #52 of the Osprey campaign series, gives a very detailed look at the background, battle, and post battle manuevering of the Confederate and Union armies. Smith is to be praised for his detailed order of battle. The text is supplemented with excellent three 3-dimensional maps that show a section of the battle, such as Little Round Top. There are six other maps and a plethora of pictures. A special bonus are the battle painting by Adam Hook which help to bring the battle to life. The 128 page book is 32 pages longer than the average Osprey Campaign book, but has the same price. The books only weakness is that in being so detailed, some readability is sacrificed. However, the text flows smoothly and the topic is gripping."
1,Do not buy this book.,"Please, do youself a favor and do not waste your money on this book. This is probably the worst book ever written on the battle of Gettysburg. I have read hundreds of volumes on the subject and have never seen anything approching the amount of errors in this work. I feel pretty confident that the author has never been to Gettysburg. The interpretation of the battle is childish. There are multiple errors on the maps, and most of the photographs are just copied out of other Civil War books. Oh! And I think is is obvious that the previous review was written by someone with a personal interest in the book. It may be of interest to note that the Gettysburg National Military Park book store refuses to carry this book on its shelves. Simply put, this book should not have been printed."
4,One of the Early Classics!,"Not color, not big but an early classic for the German dagger collector! If you are a German dagger collector and want the early books, this one is a ""must have"".Don't expect a lot of detail because this one doesn't have all the glitz and glamour but it IS one of the early ones and I suggest it for future appreciation!"
2,Should be on DVD,"The low rating is for the fact that this film and The Chipmunk Adventure are not on DVD... I loved both films, but I would love to see this and the first one put out on DVD. I thought that this movie was better in quality. The film was not too scary for kids. I would question the going into graveyards for body parts bit though... Could have been better on DVD..."
5,A whole lot of fun,"I've been a fan of the Chipmunks for years. I grew up watching the 80's cartoon with my plush Theodore by my side. I rented and watched this film with reservations because I thought they had peaked with the Chipmunk Adventure back in 1987. I was wrong. They stayed true to the personalities I remembered, even after all these years. The story was fun and the three new songs were great. I was glad to see that Theodore had a pretty significant role, and Dave's large role and Ms. Miller's cameo were nice touches. The only things missing, in my opinion, were the Chipettes. I kept expecting them to show up. Even so, I give this movie 5 stars. To the creators, know that you brought any number of smiles to the face of this 20 year old man, who has been a fan of yours since I was 3. I just hope it isn't another 12 years before we see another one (and bring the Brittany, Jeanette, and Eleanor along next time, please)."
2,Not as advertised,"The packaging says ""Joseph Abboud"" but the labels on the sheets say ""JC Penney."" The pillowcases are slightly warped because they weren't cut on right angles to the fabric grain. There is a faint stain on the top sheet. They're okay for the price--the texture is smooth and the color is attractive--but they're no bargain."
2,Unclear rules and setup,"I have over 60 board games. I should not have to scratch my head trying to figure out how to setup or execute a game, but I did just that with this one. The overall concept is solid, but it's just too time consuming to take the strip bars out and separate them. I agree that the blue and purple bars can be confusing. I played this game once and said ""never again."" University Games have put out some great games over the years, but this wasn't one of them."
2,"Interesting concept, frustrating game","My husband and I are college educated people...but my goodness! This game left us both so frustrated that we only played it once. The information in the game should be fun and it was pretty interesting, but the concept had both of us about to pull our hair out."
3,Old InDesign,"I read the ad very carefully, but I still received the old version of InDesign 1.0 which is for OX 9 and I run OX 10.4. Boy, is my face red. InDesign is a wonderful program. I designed a book in Quark Express years ago and then I designed a book in InDesign which works like a dream. There's no going back to Quark."
5,Important album from a rising star!,"The 1st time I listened to Dirt I was hearing so many excellent musical elements that I wanted to keep rewinding a bit to see if I missed anything. Several dozen times of critical listening sessions later, I realized that not only has Mark Selby elevated himself to star level but also he has distinguished himself as a songwriter who can tell the story and have the listener nodding in agreement with what he just said or smiling from the description of the dilemma/truth. I love this guy's music. Dirt is a keeper! Dirt is like the line drawn in the sand and Mark's side is the one you want to be on..."
3,"Good, but...","I just got this CD and it is good, but when I first played ""More storms comin'"" I was hooked. Storms had that great blues-rock thing going for it. Dirt is a good rock cd, but it comes up short on the blues. This is a good CD and it is a keeper, but I hope when Selby does his 3rd CD he will add the blues to it. If you are into the blues be sure to check out ""More Storms Comin'"" if you are into rock ""Dirt"" is the CD for you. Either way be sure to give Mark Selby a listen, you will be glad you did."
4,Mark Selby - Mellowed Out,"Honestly I was a bit dissapointed in Dirt - Selby's Last CD, More Storms Comin', rocked hard on almost every track.In an almost complete turnaround, the majority of the tracks on Dirt are somewhat slow and ballad-like.There are a few exceptions, for example the track One Man feels more like the rockin' Mark Selby that I grew to love, and songs like Unforgiven and Willin' To Burn reach to that same level as well.The CD is definately worth picking up if you're a Mark Selby fan, but be prepared for less than half of the CD be what you'd expect."
2,Mediocre At Best,"This album wins the prize for most misleading title. There is no dirt here-just a clean, sterile collection of songs.Mark Selby made a career writing tunes for artists like Kenny Wayne Shepard and Trisha Yearwood. ""Dirt"" showcases the songwriting style of the former much more so than it does the latter, and Selby has apparently been listening to a lot of Bob Seger and Tom Petty as well.Though it is his own album, Selby's latest offering does not stray far from what made him famous. Each exercise in generic rock with a country twang feels like it was written for someone else. The songs are well written, but they have no life."
4,Why is Obasan so mean?,"I picked this up to read because it is a story about a Japanese American girl. Karen Nomura is sent to Japan to stay awhile with her aloof grandmother (Obasan). I couldn't put this book down because I wanted to know why Obasan was so mean to Karen. You'll have to read the book to find out why and in the meanwhile, learn a little about some Japanese culture."
4,"Just ""Good""","This was a fairly good introductory book; but, like most of the _for Dummies_ titles, it's too embarrassing to have out on the table when company comes by. And, to put it lightly, my attempts at sushi are embarrassing enough on their own.There are other books out there that do a better job, but this one is good for somebody who is just getting started."
4,Very nice,"It has a lot of recipes, and the book shows you how to make sushi. You need to buy along all the materials that you need to make some shushi."
5,Sushi for Dummies,Excellent detailed book. Best part was the details on making the best rice you can as that is the main ingrediant.
5,Sushi for Dummies,"Excellent book! it really covers everything and more that you need to know about making sushi! Easy and fun to read. It covers everything, from how to pronounce some needed words, what materials you need, where to buy them (not very useful unless you live in the USA), how to prepare rice, to exotic recipes. It is just great!"
5,easy and detailed,This is a great product because it provided exactly what I was looking for. It was easy enough to be a beginner book but detailed with enough information to be helpful beyond the beginner level.My favorite part is that they offer a lot of vocabulary with definitions and pronunciations that makes eating sushi in a sushi place much easier. So it provides information applicable to both eating out and eating in.Overall a great find. I would definitely recommend it for a beginner who is looking for more than the over simplified version.
1,"Very disappointing, expensive and reader unfriendly","I was kinda expecting a book with lots of sushi recipes accompanied by amazing photos, but this one turned out to be extremely boring with just text and almost no graphics. Though it is packed with information, most of it is just common sense. Yes, it's sushi for dummies anyway. However, if you're a beginner and want to learn to make sushi on your own, I'd recommend going online. There's tons of sushi guides and great sushi recipes out there that will cost you no money. This book, in my opinion, is too pricey for that level of quality. I ordered because of the positive reviews, but I'm going to return."
3,Too Much Information,I bought this book to accompany my new sushi kit because reviewers thought the instruction manual didn't have enough information. If you are looking to make a lot of different types of really exotic sushi then this book is for you. I personally just wanted to make some roll type dishes and rice balls. For that the information that comes with the sushi kit is quite complete. All in all I found this book to be overwhelming and way too much info for my uses.
5,Blessing from the gods,"I had no idea how to prepare sushi before I got this book but i really wanted to learn how becuase i love the stuff and its to expensive at sushi bars. I was very impressed with this book. Its very simple to understand (hence the title!) and has a great layout with lots of superb recipes, enjoy!"
2,Lots of info but lacks ilustrations,"If you expect to find lots of pictures showing how to make sushi, look for a different book. I was quite frustated about this because it does not show how to cut the fish in a way that you can do it yourself. The book has a few bad illustrations and some pictures of already made sushi. That's it. Lots of good theories and good tips but I would look for a more complete book."
5,Good book,Gave it to my son and his girlfriend and they loved it. They found it easy to follow and they had a good time using it. Thanks!
5,Look out! Here comes the Sushi expert...,"After purchasing the book and reading a few of the recipes, I decided to give some of them a try for dinner. The instructions were so easy that I pulled off a sushi dinner for my family that they thought I had practiced making for days. I have taken a sushi making course before, but having the book with me while making dinner proved to be a much needed aid and I am glad I made the small investment. I have also been enjoying the other areas of the book that talk about Sushi Bar manners/etiquette, terms and definitions, and sushi party planning. Most cookbooks I have purchased are just used for recipies and not for reading or cultural education. This dummies book is actually interesting to read from cover to cover and gives the reader more depth than other cookbooks."
4,Simply the best,"As a sushi fan and amateur chef, I've struggled with this simple but challenging fare for years. This is the handbook I've always wanted. Concise, user friendly, smart and entertaining - here is the book that we've been waiting for.I'm giving copies to friends and keeping mine right by my chopping block and rice cooker."
4,"""For Dummies"" marches on!","This is the first ""For Dummies"" book I've seen with pictures. It's a nice try, but I wouldn't make this my only sushi cookbook. The explanations are pretty good and well in keeping with the ""for dummies"" tradition. I think sometimes they waffle a little bit on principles (saying one thing, but then admitting that they do it another way).After reading reviews for this rather unlikely book and for another book with reputedly superb photography, I elected to purchase both and I wasn't disappointed: the other book with the amazing illustrations wasn't expensive and the two really complement each other:The Complete Book Of Sushi! The price is right: buy both."
5,great,Very good book. If you cant figure it out you are a dummy!!! You don't need to be a chef but a foodie!! great seller fast
5,Great introduction to Sushi,"I was looking for an absolute beginner's book for making sushi, and that's what this book is. It covers all the basics and has all the essential recipes. Great book."
3,Pretty close to 4 (surprisingly),"Amazingly enough these guys managed to create a really good album after 20 years of making hard-rock arena-style music. Good for them, I say! So let's see - what is good here? ""Look Into The Sun"", ""Just Wanna Make Love To You"", ""Tonite.."" which is a slightly better (IMHO) version of this number from Stand Back, ""I'm A Man"", ""Mind Over Matter"" - these are all my favorites and when I encounter five good songs on a CD then I can have a party, dude! I mean this doesn't happen often in this age of bubblegum manufacturing and old geezers like Rolling Stones and U2 issuing same rather boring stuff over and over again. So I guess this is a good CD - go buy it if you have extra fifteen bucks saved and stashed away."
4,Cheesy music but lot's of fun,"I bought this for my 6 year old daughter and she loves it. My two year old son has a lot of fun with it too. I really have no complaints other than I thought that the music would be better quality. The music on this sounds more like the old Atari 2600 system of the old days. Anyway, pick one up, there's sure to be hours of enjoyment had with this."
1,Not what I expected!!!!!!!!!!!,I purchased this toy for my girls ages 3 and 9 they both love the ones at the archade I knew it would not be as good but it is even worst that I expected. I would not recommend it to anyone the music is horrible It is not at all what I expected.
4,"Awful music, but great kids alternative to DDR","My daughter received this for her 6th birthday. She had tried DDR in the past, but it was too hard for her, and the mat is made for people with longer legs. But this toy she can do, plus it's got the other two games. I'm not a big fan of Bratz, but it's easy to get past that. The music is truly horrible, even my daughter thinks so. But it's worth it to have a child-friendly substitute for DDR. And it really helps teach coordination, and how to pay attention to directions. The instructions say that it has to be played on a hard floor, but it works just fine on our carpet."
2,Very misleading,"My daughter and I ran across this toy, and reading the box it sounded great. She loves dancing and music, so we were sold. After bringing it home we found that it does NOT play the actual songs, but a mere muzak version, and my daughter could barely recognize her favorite songs. It is difficult for her to dance along with the music, as it just sounds like a toy. I was very disappointing, and feel the product description is very misleading."
4,Book review,Schenck is a family name and enjoyed reading from that standpoint and it is also good Bible reading.
2,Poorly constructed,I enjoy Tod Mcfarlane Models. Ive got several this is one of the worst. It just doesnt hold its self together. Falls apart and doesnt stay on the base board. Falls over all the time.
3,Secrets of the Unknown.. somewhat explained,"After reading both the good and bad reviews, I went ahead and bought this. I watched it with my Pagan Study group, and we had a pretty good laugh. The special effects are corny, and most of the information on their sources and other data are flashed on and off the screen so fast you can not really read them. They do not discuss Eclectic Witchcraft at all. BUT!!!! The information from actual practicioners is good. In fact, they represent themselves and the Craft very well. If you take into account the cheesy effects and when it was produced, it is a good tape to have to explain what what Witches are and what they do. Not to deep, but enough to answer the more common questions."
2,"Bad pacing, ok workout, supp. equipments not useful","Most of the moves go too quickly, does not give your muscles are full workout. If you want to remember the moves and work it on your own that's fine. But then again why don't you just buy a book and do it yourself?The ""sculpting stick"" which does not include with the video, is not particularly useful to the type of workout suggested. With or without do the same.Also, the three 12 mins workouts was too short to make the video worth its price. I'm sure there are plenty of workout videos out there with better pacing for a full workout on your muscles and longer selection recorded. For example, I tried Tamilee Webb's Abs, Arms and Legs of Steel, that is much better I think."
2,NOT What I Was Hoping For...,"I had worn out my copy of The Firm's 5-Day Abs so I thought I would try something new. Bad decision. There are way too many moves in a short period of time so you really don't feel one exercise before you move on to the next. In addition, you really need to buy the ""Firm Sculpting Stick"" to make many of the exercises work, which I found insulting and rather marketing-minded. I am sending this back!"
1,Does not work with Mac Lion,"Note to the Wild Divine people: if you're going to charge $300 a pop for your product and you know it doesn't work with a major operating system, you might want to let people know.Lion OS X for Mac has been out for quite a while, and the folks over at Wild Divine: 1. apparently aren't going to make their software compatible; and 2. are going to start charging people who use the iOM machine for an online account.Not. Helping. My. Stress. Levels."
1,FALSE ADVERTISING!!!!!!!!!!!!!,DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY. Much to my surprise i received only one bone. the item weight is 36.2lbs and the original pricing is $103.2. when i called the company the gave me the run around for 3 days before i threatened to file a claim. within 5 min a manager called me back and said it was falsely marked and she would refund my money. when i told her i do not want my money back i want the correct items i had ordered. she said she was not willing to take the loss. This company does NOT hold to its word or advertising.... they tried about 10 different excuses to appease me. i will be reporting them to the BBB.
2,Don't know either way???,"I purchased this for my 11 year old cat, ""Tiger""..who had been diagnosed with liver issues. I don't know if it worked or didn't work. He had developed jaundice and we were syringe feeding him ..3 times a day.. So his condition could have been to far gone before this product arrived. My only concern with this product is that it contains alcohol.. Liver problems and alcohol??? Doesn't sound good to me. I used this product about 8 times and mixed with his food in the syringe..It seemed to burn his mouth/throat and he drooled really bad...End result, we had to put Tiger down and I threw these drops in the garbage.. These could be miracle drops, but not at my house.. although my review is negative, the seller was wonderful, very fast service."
5,Takes you places you've never been -- a fine collection,"A lovely and troubling collection of stories. Kirkus seems bothered by the fact that in many of the stories, there is no tidy resolution -- but isn't that a lot more like real life? (Kirkus probably reads too many books...) In this collection you can really get to know some of the people who you might recognize on the street, or who you already know in passing -- and thus for anyone who is a genuine student of human nature and the human condition, this is a deeply satisfying collection. I had the pleasure of reading Honig's novel Picking Up so was pleased to see that she had published another book and won another prize -- Picking Up, also a prizewinner, is worthy of much wider dissemination and maybe now it will get a second chance."
3,An attractive look!,"This is a nice looking bracelet (band), and I was interrested in all the beads attached. It is all elastic but one of the rows was a kind of weak and started to hang loose right from the start! I did not want to return for an excange, because I didn't want to spent more money on it, since it was quite on the price - I thought! Still not a bad bracelet if you look for something new!"
2,Low quality not low enugh price,"We bought this item after a lot of research to find the ""perfect"" TV stand. We bought this one because of the look, price & depth (we have a deep receiver). It is all particle board (didn't realize that when we ordered it). One of the shelf pieces bent in shipment and now we have a crease going down it. It took hours to assemble (they only sent exactly the # of bolts etc you need and some got lost in shipment) by my husband who is VERY handy. And he said it will stand pretty but could fall apart if not moved carefully!"
3,A lot of screws... one missing,"If you are shopping for a nice looking cabinet, this is a very nice looking one. It takes a while to assemble. It was missing one of the MANY screws, so I sent my son to the hardware store to try to match the missing one. The doors are VERY hard to put on so that they do not scrape the bottom. The screws that attach the doors strip the wood easily. The product looks good, but for the price I was expecting something that would not strip so easily."
4,"major assembly, but looks nice","Be prepared for piece-by-piece assembly. After lengthy assembly process, the TV stand looks nice and is very sturdy."
3,It serves it's purpose,"This TV stand arrived about 2 weeks after I ordered it and I began to assemble it. It took about 6 hours by myself - you have to assemble EVERYTHING. It came with everything except some dowels needed for assembly, so I went out to a local hardware store and bought some instead of waiting to call the company and have them shipped out. That was my main problem with the unit. Assembly was fairly easy and everything fit together nice.The Quality is decent but I expected more. The smell is strong but hopefully that will go away soon. Some of the wood had small chips and imperfections in the paint, but it is barely noticeable once put together. It is very heavy and sturdy enough to hold my old 32"" projection tv without a problem. Overall I am satisfied but would probably go with another manufacturer next time."
4,Looks Great and holds all my components,"This was delivered to my house in a book that looked it was dragged here. Each and every piece inside the box was wrapped and packe great nothing was really damaged but the finish was very inconsistant. I called Bush for replacement panels for the ones I deemed unacceptable. Thry did not want the panels back and shipped the new ones out. I received them two days later and 50% were ok. Bush was called a second time and they great about making sure I was happy. Finally all the pieces were acceptable, it went together without a hitch but it does take a little while, though not complicated. The whole thing together does weigh a ton, which does make it feel like furniture and that it won't fall apart or collapse under the weight. This thing holds everything, I have a PS3, cable box, 2x 400-disc cd changers, dvd player, receiver, and vcr in this cabinet with a 46"" lcd tv on top. It looks awesome."
4,A must for criminal procedure.,"This supplement is a must. It will save you time and energy. Bloom and Brodin give clean definitions for 4th amendment, 5th, and 6th. A friend of mine who passed the July 05 CA Bar (on the first attempt), used this book as her sole preparation for criminal procedure essay section. The checklist located in the appendix will ensure that you will not miss any issues."
2,Sucks compared to the other Examples and Explanation books,I really like Examples and Explanations (e.g. CivPro and Contracts). But this book wasn't useful to me at all. It feels more like a survey article in a newspaper than a helpful commercial source.My professor said that only commercial source that was any good re Constitutional Criminal Procedure is the book by Lafave and Israel.
3,Not a helpful study aid,"This book was a real disappointment compared to others in the examples and explanations series. Most of the examples were simply cases that if you had studied at all you would already know. If you didn't bother to do the reading for your class, then maybe it would be helpful."
2,not happy,"These lights came with no instructions. The box says ""plug and play"", however the adaptors did not fit and I had to splice wires and the installation was much more difficult than I had expected. The seals do not seem to fix the truck exactly and I am worried that they are not going to be completely waterproof and they may leak."
2,Not what it said on the internet or box,"Of all the items I have ordered through AMAZON, this is the only one I was not satisfied with, and could not hold back. I put this item on a 2004 GMC 2500 HD to replace the existing Amber roof lights. This item said it was a ""Direct Factory Replacement installation on 2002-2007 Chevy & GMC CK Series Heavy Duty Pickups"". The box actually said these Plug and Go. NOT TRUE, without cuting your existing plug and the RECON plug and splicing. I called the RECON Company 1-800 support number for confirmation. After explaining the situation, the support person agreed that I would have to cut my factory plug and the RECON plug. Not sure he had ever seen a Cab Roof Light. Now I'm thinking what the HE#$, this is exactly what they said it would fit. They did fit the factory fasteners, however they leaked also. Had to remove them and add marine grade silicone inside their rubber seal. Not sure why I gave them a 2 star except for they look good."
1,Leaked,I ordered these for my then brand new 2006 Chevy Silverado 2500HD which already came with factory mounted roof lights but thought it would look cool with the clear amber ones from RECON. Mistake I wanted to let others know about and avoid. After a couple of months I began to get water in the cab that would drain into my sunglasses holder that was mounted on the roof liner and at first I thought it was the roof visor I had installed but after investigating further it was the RECON lights that had the seal come loose from the light possibly because of poor glue the company uses on these lights and the water would sit on the flat rubber surface and leak into the cab. Avoid this product especially if your just going for a change in looks from the manufactured look. Not worth it.
4,Nice looking!,I like the way these look but the electrical connector ends are different than what is on the truck so you'll have to cut and splice these lights in. It was more difficult than expected because its not that easy to work on the roof of your truck.
5,excellent,I thought this was very good. Helen Talbot was a great sidekick to the hero and guys if your into the hero rescuing the pretty sidekick Federal Operator99 is full of it from the opening scene when the bad guys are trying to force our hero into a closet and there is our heroine Helen Talbot bound and gagged. All 12 chapters are action packed
2,NOT WORTH IT,IT'S DURABLE (FLEXIBLE AND WELL MADE PLASTIC PIECES) BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY WORK. IT COMES WITH A CAR TOO HEAVY TO BE PUSHED BY THE BAR. i TRIED USING LIGHTER HOTWHEELS CARS BUT THE SPEED GIVEN TO THEM IS NOT ENOUGH TO GO PAST HALF THE TRACK. VERY MEDIOCRE TOY. WOULDN'T RECOMMEND
5,Crime Scene at the Cardwell Ranch,I really enjoyed this book from the first chapter it kept me interested enough that I didn't want to put it down. B J Daniels has become one of my favoritewriters.
4,Worth The Read,"Dana's a target, of whom, is unknown. But the marshal is going to find out, even if it kills the both of them. Dana doesn't want Hudson's help, didn't he hurt her enough years ago. The story of lost love is predictable, but a nice read. Worth taking a look at."
5,Amazing book...,This was an amazing book for me..I loved the story line and the way things turned out...It reminds you about family bonds and to forgive...amazing...
2,Predictable until it gets absurd,"Dull conflict between the main characters that could have been resolved with a simple conversation, lack of heat between the main characters, and a predictable mystery that resolves in an incredibly unrealistic way. This is one to skip."
2,super annoying main character,"So the book started off fine, but by the end, I was hating the Dana character. She was so annoying. And nothing she did made sense. [spoilers] Gee...I know there is a killer on the loose to get me, but I think I'll take off by myself when I was just expressly told not to because I'm so worried about every gossipy mofo in this town. Gosh my sister is missing, I think, but I will ignore a plot hole, and go have sex with my old boyfriend, and ignore my missing sister and father who just had a heartattack in the next town over. I mean, really???!!! Bad."
3,Crime reading,I found this book OK but crime is really not my subject. I prefer historical novels or history books in general.Short versions are important as I have little time to read.
5,choice,"I chose this book because I like the theme of ranching. Yes I would recommend this book to someone, which I have."
1,Never got it,I order it but never got the download version or soft copy neither hard copy.would like to get it thow. Do not recommend this item to anyone
4,Loved The Suspense,"A great suspense story, it kept me contemplating right to the end. Every time I thought maybe I figured things out, new facts would pop up to make me change my mind. I am not an avid reader and I found myself neglecting chores because I just couldn't put this book down! Easy to read and not too long."
3,Enjoyable,"When I downloaded this book for free on my kindle, I wasn't sure what to expect. I was surprised to thoroughly enjoy the book. It was well written, and for a quick read the characters were fairly well developed. There was intrigue throughout, and though I had a strong suspicion about the ending, I was still guessing the whole way through. The book had romance without it being nauseatingly sweet or over the top. Nice, light read!"
2,"Too predictable, I called it","The ending of this book was too expected. I figured out if they were going to be together or not, who the murderer is, and how individuals' relationship was going to be. I just wanted to read to the end to make sure I was right. However, I cannot say it was a really bad story/plot, but there was not enough mystery to it. I agree with one of the reviewers that ""there was incorrect word usage and poor grammar."" It is free and that could make up for the lack of some things..."
4,"A great read, and free to boot!",This book was on the free list so I figured I would give it a read. I like Harlequin books so I guessed that I would like this too. Well written.
2,Not Bad For a Harlequin.Reviewer: Sucker For Freebies,"Asothers have said, I'm not a fan of Harlequin romances since they are usually cookie-cutter, but this one was a little better than average. Fairly good plotting - I changed my mind several times about who the culprit was - didn't settle on anyone until almost the end, and then I was only half right. However the writing was lame. The author seems not to have heard of the ""show, don't tell"" method of writing and the story, therefore, is too slow and static. This is only worsened by a rather abrupt ending, leaving me asking ""What just happened here?"" Also thought the characters were pretty sketchy. It would have been easier to keep track of them if I had known a little more about each one. As it was, I had to look back at the author's ""cast of characters"" list at the beginning of the book to make sure I knew who she was talking about. If you have nothing else to do on a lazy summer day, this was O.K."
2,"More romance, less mystery",I deleted this book after reading about 20% of it.It moved slowly and seemed to be largely about an old romance and a disfunctional family and very little about a crime scene.It held my interest when the crime portion of the story was covered....bored me otherwise.
2,"Slow, dull, boring","Moved at a very slow pace. Didn't hold my attention. Found myself skipping paragraphs and even entire pages just to get through it. Characters were not believable. Would have been beter to cut a lot of the ""filler nonsense"" and make it a short story! Not BJ Daniels best work!"
4,Itouch user agrees!,I am a new Ipod touch user and have downloaded many free books to test my device. I have read many mediocre books and this is the first book that I could not wait to get to the end. The author did not repeat over and over again details of the plot or the characters. I liked it very much and will try more stories by this author. Reading on the Ipod touch is great!
4,good book,I really enjoyed this book. I like books about small town life since I'm from a small town originally. It had just the right amount of mystery and romance as well as forgiving family relationships. Plus you can't beat the price on kindle.
2,Disappointing,"For an award winning author, I was really let down. The writing was lazy with too many sentences starting with, ""As I"", ""As he"", ""As she"". Totally unecessary except for word count.There were breif moments of good descriptions, but the remainder of the book was blasé with little to draw me into the characters. Hud's mood swings from ""cop face"" to sensitive lover were abrupt and overdone. Dana came across as a ball busting, spoiled child. It was her way or the highway with a sudden reversal at the end of the story.The picture on the cover was the best part."
2,Terrible at best,"I liked the price (free) and that's about it. What a terrible premise and poorly written. Standard characters, ridiculous plot and a completely predictable ending. Don't waste your time with this one even if it costs you nothing."
3,Good suspense,"I won't recap the story since others have done that already. Daniels knows how to right a suspense story. I will say that everytime I think I had figured out who had ""done it"", I changed my mind. There are the obvious suspects as with most suspenses, but it was very fast paced, and thought out. If you're a Nora Roberts fan, then this will remind you of Montana Sky and Angel Falls, it has a very similar plot to those stories. Overall, I enjoyed the book, but found it to be rushed towards the end. I wanted to know what happened to the rest of the suspects and the main characters. I felt the ending was too abrupt and wanted more. For that, I gave it 3 stars."
3,Worth a shot,"I didn't realize this was a Harlequin book when I downloaded it but I ended up enjoying the book and since it was free, one can't complain too much :) Give it a shot, it was a decent read."
4,Crime Scene at Cardwell Ranch,I really enjoyed read this book. It was very hard to put down and there was Times I did not get all my work done before dinner time. I can't wait to read more of B.J.Daniels work. Please kept up the good work.
3,Kudos to the writer for having guts,"I think it takes some guts to mix erotica with crime scene horror/drama because it's reaching into an area that logically makes sense but not many have the guts to do it. Gosh, this author went full speed ahead and I think that deserves something. Now, that being said, I think the actual execution of the story is not very strong. The main character acts in ways that just plain don't make sense even with her character development. Even if a person is spoiled, they aren't about to do something really dumb to put their life at risk. I've known people just as spoiled as the main character with much less willingness to run out blindly in the face of danger. That and she just plain wasn't likable.There are also a ton of grammatical errors all throughout this book to a ridiculous degree. Whoever did the editing must have actually gone through and added typos. It was definitely distracting. With all of the grammatical errors, this book would definitely be 2 stars."
3,Interesting story,"This isn't a great romance novel but it's a decent one, especially for free on the Kindle! The plot is kind of ridiculous at times (the circumstances around how the two lovers were initially driven apart are kind of preposterous, as is the plot twist at the end), but it's fairly engaging. The characters are likeable, and the story is suspenseful. There's not much steam in the book--if that's what you're looking for you'll be disappointed. The love story is sweet, though there's not really much depth there. A fun read if you're looking for something light."
5,Loved it,"One of my favorite books, that I've read. Loved the unexpected twist.Great read. There was just enough drama and romance."
3,"Slow start, but then made up for it","I must say I almost put this book down after reading just a few chapters. To me it seemed to get off to a slow start, and just couldn't keep my attention. Then about half way through, it picked up. Not a lot of romance for a Harlequin, but a good recreational read."
4,Crime Scene,"Loved the book! Hated the ending! Believable characters and well paced story line. However, I turned the final page not knowing it was the final page. I thought my Kindle was broken. I paged back and forth to no avail. Extremely abrupt ending where an epilogue would have been in order to keep the story from dropping off into nothing."
4,Great Read for a Harlequin romance,"I am not a fan of Harlequin (I usually find them insipid) but I will occasionally pick up their Intrigue books if the price is right. However, I really enjoyed Crime Scene at Cardwell Ranch and was pleasantly surprised. Not an intricate plot but a really entertaining whodunit with enough development of the characters to make the romance believable. I would definately read B.J. Daniels work again."
5,Loved it!!!,This in my opinion was a wonderful book. Well written and kept you guessing til the end. I have also suggested this book to several friends and everyone of them that I know that has read it loved it as well. Thank you for such a great read. Can't wait to read more.
4,Good Read,I was surprised at how much I liked this book. Didn't even realize it was a romance novel until it was nearly half-way through!
3,not a romance reader,"Its been many years since I read a romance novel so I chose this one on the Kindle. Its ok but rather predictable, except in the area of the mystery itself. I was surprised by the ""who done it"". The love part all in all was quite predictable. Won't read another romance novel unless all the stars are filled in."
3,Just okay,"This book was just okay. It did end a little abruptly, in that we are used to books ending on the prose of undying love, where this ended more like a movie where although there would be no sequel you knew what would happen next. The story was okay for me. I did not feel the chemistry between the two main characters, but the mystery was pretty good. It was a free ebook, so I'm glad I didn't buy it. This story was not enough to make me want to search out this author."
4,A Good Romance/Mystery if I do say so.,"I never used to read romance novels and certainly not Harlequins but I try to explore as many of the free Kindle downloads as possible and if they are any good I will read the whole thing.This story had me from the first few sentences. Finding bones, and then finding out you have to work with an ex-boyfriend to solve the mystery. Yep... I was hooked. I must say though that I found some of the names for the characters to be a bit out there. Hudson Savage-- what a mouthful. He turns out to be somewhat of a mysterious and dreamy mouthful though so I forgave the odd name and stuck out the story.Without giving away any of the twists and turns I will just say that this book delivers egde of the seat moments, drama, intrigue and most certainly-- the romance!"
2,"Freebie is a Romance cum Thriller. Nancy, Seattle, WA.","Usual romantic entanglements with some well written scenes. The mystery is initially intriguing only to become weird at end. For a love story with a happy ending with some twists along the way, this will do nicely."
4,Enjoyable enough,"I'm not a big Harlequin fan, but browsing for some new books to read on my Kindle, I came across Crime Scene at Cardwell Ranch. What the heck, I thought, I'll try it. It didn't take me long to read it, and I have to say it was a pretty decent read. I had low expectations, particularly since it's a free Kindle download, but the book was pretty enjoyable. Much better than some I've paid $8.00 for. I enjoyed the characters, the writing, and the dialogue. Even the plot was interesting. The only complaint I have was that I think it needed one more chapter, or an epilogue at the end. But all in all, a good read."
4,Nice Afternoon Read,I was looking for something quick and easy to read after the series I just finished and this book was perfect. A little romance and lots of mystery. A few aspects I figured out rather quick but others were a refreshing surprise. My only complaint was the ending left me wanting more. All and all for a Kindle freebie it was a good one.
4,An Unexpected Read,"I have to admit, I was surprised that this is classified as a romance novel - it reads more like a mystery. The story dragged a bit in some places, but it's a nice read that keeps you guessing until the end."
4,Not bad!,"This book turned out to be much better than I thought it would. It was well-written and I found the main characters pretty likeable. I especially liked when the author would write about an encounter between, say, Hud and Dana, first from her perspective and then from his. Those scenarios provided quite a bit of humor and seemed very realistic to me. Additionally, it was an easy read without being boring and the plot did keep me guessing til the end (or almost the end, anyway). I can't say that the ending was the most spectacular in the world (hence my 4 star rating), but it made sense and it ended like I wanted it to. Some of the situations seemed a little out there (like the Hud/Stacy thing, not to give anything away), but they were forgivable because of the entertainment factor. I'd definitely recommend this book if you're looking for a quick, easy, entertaining crime novel, and I wouldn't hesitate to read another of B.J. Daniels' books."
3,A good Harlequin Intrigue,"This book was well written, the two main characters are both strong, the plot is excellent, basically a good book. The reason I gave this book only three stars is that the author shows the lady character, Dana Cardwell as a strong, independent, greatly admired by the town, but she can't hold her own with her family. Dana has an older brother who abuses women and in the book he verbally and physically abuses her, but she just turns a blind eye to it and does nothing about it because she doesn't want him to lose control. Not only is her brother abusive, but so is the rest of her family in one way or another not just towards her but to others as well. She can be bull-headed and strong, opinionated, not bend to her former lover, who is the sheriff but she can't stand up to her abusive family members."
4,Good one,This was a nice change from my normal romance reads.The crime unfolds very well and it was a pleasure to read.
4,wasn't my favorite read,"This wasn't my favorite read but it did take me half way through the book to figure out ""who dun it"". got to have a little mystery in life"
3,Romantic suspense,"A light mystery with a little romance (not too graphic) thrown in. I enjoyed it, although this is not a genre that I typically read."
4,Well-written book!,I was surprised at how well-written this book was. It had even more suspense and romance than I was expecting.
4,Surprised,This book keeps you guessing until the last few chapters I never expected the killer. Very well written would like to see another book with Hud and Dana to see if they marry.
3,It was okay,"Great that it was free but wasn't a ""great"" book, just standard mystery/romance novel. I did enjoy the story, but probably wouldn't want to pay for it. Good book to pass the time."
4,Great 1st read!,"This was the first B.J. Daniels book I've read and I can't get enough. Both characters gripped me right from the beginning and you could feel the tension between them. The undying love they still had for each other was powerful. The end was very surprising and I didn't see it coming. I'm not really into cowboys and that genre but B.J. doesn't make the whole story about being a cowboy/cowgirl, it's just the backdrop. Now I can't get enough. Keep 'em coming!"
3,Good quick read,"I thought it was a decent book, fairly predictable, but a good quick read if you're looking for something light. However I did think the ending was VERY abrupt. It just.. stopped. I was not at all impressed with the ending, I almost felt like maybe my Kindle didn't download it right, but all the after story information was there. So don't expect much for an ending. Definitely glad I got it as a free ebook."
5,Couldn't put my kindle down.,"I'm a big fan of harlequin intrigue and romantic suspense and this book delivers. The characters are engaging, the storyline is well-paced, and the mystery was just complicated enough to keep you guessing. I was so eager to get through the book, I didn't realize I was going to be so sad when I was finished with it. I'm going to be looking up other books from B.J. Daniels."
4,"Interesting, Fast Paced, and Short.","My college student center handed out free copies of this romance+mystery novel to girls at my school. I read it because It's the only book I had right now that I hadn't read and I wanted something new. I was actually pleasantly surprised. I'm not hugely into romance, but this book really kept the smut on the down low and focused more of the mystery aspect. It was a predictable romance/mystery plot, but still a fun, short read. I enjoyed the hero and heroine and the plot was complicated enough to be interesting without being confusing. This novel was fast paced and short. The identity of the culprit is predictable but I still had a racing heart in the end when all was revealed."
4,A Great adventure,"I thoroughly enjoyed Crime Scene at Cardwell Ranch. This is my first book by BJ Daniels. She is a great writer who manages to convey the feelings of both the hero and the heroine at all times. When Hud Savage returns to Montana after five years away, he reconnects with his lost love Dana when a skeleton is discovered on her property. As Hud attempts to solve the mysterious death, he falls into the path of Dana. Dana once loved Hud with all her heart and soul, but her trust in him was shattered when he did the unthinkable. I loved this book. Hud and Dana were a great, loving couple who were star-crossed through misunderstandings and deception. GREAT."
5,Great story. Good writing. One you won't put down.,I really enjoyed this story. I thought I had it figured out several times but I was surprised. The story is well told and full of suspense. I'm sorry I started this one in the evening because I stayed up way to late thinking I'd get to a place where I wouldn't mind stopping but I never did. I picked it up the next day at first chance to continue.
3,mystery romance,"It was a nice romance mystery. Dana cardwell lives on the family ranch. her family is making her sell the ranch. 5 years earlier she got her sister in bed with her fiance who than left town. on cardwell ranch old homstead well is found a murder victum and when the new sherriff comes its Hud her old boyfriend. Dana ends up dealing with a murder victum her whole family forcing her to sell,old boyfriend who doesnt remember that night 5 years ago. somone has tried to kill dana now. has lots of suspects, action and romance. story is well written. enjoyable escapism for a couple of hours."
4,Great book full of suspence,"The other reviews said a lot, i won't try to compete. Simply, this book was a pageturner. It really made me sit up and thinb, the characters were well defined and realistic."
3,Dragged too much for me...,"This book is ok in general, but it dragged on too much for me. I had it figured out who was the prime suspect(s) a while before it finally came out. And the romance between Hud and Dana was just annoyingly slow for me.Nothing spectacular, but still an ok light read with a bit of romance thrown in."
3,Pleasantly Surprised,"I got this book as a freebie on my Kindle so I wasn't expecting much. Throughout the book, I thought the plot was obvious, but there were some twists and turns at the end that surprised me. I think the characters could have been filled out a little more, though.That said, it was a decent read. :)"
3,"Has some good scenes, okay book",Predictable and not what I was looking for. Was a free-bee with my Kindle. Story line was good...murder mystery...and I will admit the suspense part was not predictable. But their love story was not believable and I knew what would happen before it did. Good book overall though and not bad for a free-bee.
4,Great freebie book!,"I downloaded this because it was free and was pleasantly surprised! A great little mystery/romance, well written and not ridiculously predictable. I can't say I would necessarily purchase her books, but romance is just not my normal genre. No complaints!"
4,Something New,Let me start by saying I'm a huge fan of horror movies. I thought the diretor did a fantastic job with the story. I look forward to seeing more movies from Ms. Teague.
3,Good product..not so great shipment,"I was pleased to find this product as I have been searching everywhere for it! But I was slightly dissapointed because when I opened the package, it smelled sooo strong of the medicine. And when I opened the box to get the tube out...the lid was un-screwed!! It made me feel like it might have been used already so made me a little hesitant to use it myself! But that was the only downfall of it. The product itself is good and works well."
2,Got it for my dog,"I don't know if technically the thing on my dogs ankle was a boil, but was hoping this stuffwould help draw out the gunk in it and it really didn't do much of anything after several daysuse. Others have been satisfied, but honestly I'd give it half a star but to be fair I was usingit on my dog and probably the skin is tougher than what you'd encounter with your average boil.If there is such a thing."
1,It's not what you think it is!,"If you are looking for black salve as Boil Ease used to be years ago, don't be duped into buying this item, Boil Ease ""Pain Relieving Ointment."" It's not the same as the old Boil Ease black ""Drawing Salve"" was. This ""pain relieving"" product is white and has a different ingredient list than the old black salve I wish it still was."
4,Boil Relief,"Boil Ease is an excellent ointment to use on a painful boil. My understanding is that the ointment no longer can be considered a drawing salve, but I find it still seems to speed the process. Also, it seems to make the area less painful."
2,Just say no....,"Despite the author's own glowing review, this book was really disappointing. I am currently reviewing the majority of ADT book offerings for my own use and to recommend/sell to my students at the ATC I am an instructor at. I would recommend Ed Goldberg's or Paul Aubin's book before you think of this one.This book offers little past the basics. For example, the chapter on roof slabs consists of putting a basic ADT roof on a building and converting it to slabs. Cut a hole in it. Youre done. For this youre expected to pay ...? Dont even bother...a very lightweight effort to a very complex program."
1,Confusing Autodesk Manuals provide more Information,"Sorry, Elise Moss and Chris Fox but I found this book a waste of my time, explaining less than an Autodesk manual. This book explains nothing I can't find under the program's help. This book skips over area boundaries, simple customization and has yet to answer any of my questions. I don't even think I'll ever reference this book for anything.Very Disapointing."
3,And now for something 'different',"Those who've watched and are familiar with the Gundam Wing plot would find no evidence of the happenings in this volume (I still have yet to read the 2nd and 3rd book) in the series or in anywhere else. It might as well be completely disconnected. G-Unit has a few ties here and there with the apearance of Lady Une and Nicol, but it seems to be off in its own little universe that you don't really even have to know what's going on in the series to be able to enjoy reading this.The story itself starts off pretty well with this first volume, but it lacks the 'feel' of the After Colony (Gundam Wing) universe - that's not bad per say, it's just different. In thus saying, it's not a definite must have, but it's still a good read; It's a ""should"" get for Wing fans, at the very least."
2,This does come in white - contact the company,You don't have to get the brick color - though they do not sell the white online - request their catalog and buy from that.
4,Red regular jar rubber,Product (red rubber jar rings) was exactly what I was needing. Product was shipped in a timely manner. I intend to use this rings with antique glass flats and old canning jars to store spices in my kitchen.
3,Rubber jar rings,These rings were much lighter than the ones they replaced but they fit and did the job. I would buy these again if I couldn't find better ones.
5,Replacement Jar Rubbers,These replacement rubbers are perfect for use with regular-mouthed canning jars. You just need to sterilize them before use. Couldn't be easier.
1,Not Embossing Powders,"This product came up when I searched embossing powders, the color selection looked great so I bought it. The problem using them to emboss is you hve to mix with a clear embossing powder, which I did. But the fine powder colors the paper, which I do not want. Was very messy and now need to order true embossing powders. I recommend the Stampendous Embossing Powder Selection."
1,not embossing powder,"I was searching for embossing powder and this came up, it was teamed with an embossing gun so I figured that is what it was. But it isn't it is useless and messy for scrapbooking."
5,No Pepper Great Gravy,"Pioneer gravy packs I think are the best! I don't likepepper, my husband does. We buy this varietyand he adds pepper at the table.It's smooth, easy to prepare. Grate on the frozenbiscuits we buy! Beats eating out!"
5,Happy Customer,My wife and I purchased several Shake 'N Go toys this Christmas for our grandchildren. We bought them because they were unique and are constructed to take the beating of pre-school aged children. We are very happy with the ones we bought and plan to purcahse more for the kids.
3,Cover is a good cover,The only thing wrong with the cover is you can not put it on if the weather is freezing out because it sticks to the vehicle. So if it is snowing or freezing rain you can not put the cover on when you need it
5,Small and lightweight is not a bad thing!!!,"I purchased one of these little vacs after my mom had bought hers and I tried to convence her she had waisted her money. Well, now I own one and I have to admit it is the best vac I have ever owned. It is small but I am 6'5"" and have no trouble using it. It is a powerful little vac that does an EXCELLENT job of cleaning. The filter is easy to clean and there is a small door on the bottom in case anything should get into the cleaner that shouldn't be. The switch also lets you turn off the brush to vac bare floors."
2,"Powerful vacuum, poorly designed","My wife did her research and found this vacuum as highly rated on several sites. She bought 2 - one for home, one for my office.The vacuum is powerful, lightweight and easy to manuever. The filter clogs, but as long as you clean it every third or fourth usage, everything is fine again. To me, a minor annoyance, as it demonstrates how powerful the suction is.Now the big problem. On both machines, the dirt cup will not stay attached to the vacuum body. The latch will not seat properly.Phone calls to Eureka produced no results. They insisted we were not latching it properly.We still have both machines because they do an excellent job, but we have to use tape to keep the dirt cups in place.I would not purchase this vacuum again."
2,No Good Info,No information on discovering information that couldn't be found on the first page of a search engine. All very mundane suggestions.
3,Split Vote!,Admittedly I don't know much about wine or wine glasses other than what i've used in nice restaurants. This set looks exactly like the picture and that is great. The only problem I see with them is their weight. I'm not sure if wine glasses are suppose to be this light but i've never held glasses with such little weight. Seriously the box weighs more than the glasses do. This is a problem for me because they seem so ridiculously light that I actually had to check if they were made of plastic. Anyways thats why I gave 3 stars (as a undecided gesture).
5,Try the new Bormioli glass,"I've never liked Bormioli wine glasses. They always seem to put form, Euro-style, over function, wine tasting. When I first saw the Bormioli Esperienze all-purpose glass with its cutesy concentric rings INSIDE the bowl I laughed. I laugh no more.Last Saturday I went to an American Pinot Noir tasting/dinner on Cape Cod where two of the wines refused to show their bouquet no matter how much we swirled, swished, palm warmed and cussed. Finally the hostess pulled down her box of Bormioli Esperienze all-purpose glasses, poured from her top of the line Riedels into them and passed them around. The bouquets exploded. It must have been those cutesy little rings echoing the esters. The dullards became instant brainiacs and one of them was declared best-of-show. Betcha a Beychevelle to a TwoBuckChuck that Riedel's already scoping out Bormioli's patent on cutesy little rings."
5,Only glasses needed,"After seeing these glasses in a magazine article, I was skeptical. But after a taste test of freshly opened wine in a regular glass and these glasses... no comparison. Even my most jaded friend admitted they work in aerating the wine without swirling or letting the wine breathe. The lip of the glass is thin, like Reidel glasses, but at a better price. Only drawback... they don't fit in your dishwasher, but you wouldn't do that with Reidel glasses either. I intend on getting more!"
5,"Sor, Complete Guitar Music, Vol. 10","Jason Vieaux presents these works by Sor with wonderful finesse, restraint and elegance. His technique is impeccable, but beyond that he has a clear understanding of the guitar music of the period and is therefore able to present on the modern guitar Sor's compositions in such a way that the listener can sense the care with which they were no doubt written. He neither overwhelms the studies of Op. 44 -- which many guitarists would consider beneath them in their simple demands, nor understates them. The temptation would have been to just toss them off, but Vieaux has clearly given each piece considerable thought. Possible the best I've heard Sor played, way better than the pedantic Segovia!"
2,Disappoting,"As a huge fan of Perdition City, I must admit that this one isunfortunately disappoting. It's less about melodies, more 'bout ambience. So if you didn't watch the flick (like I do) it's worthless."
5,Guerlain Terracotta Bronzing is the absolute best!,"Guerlain makes the best bronzer on the market and I had a difficult timefinding it until I went to Amazon.I am more than pleased with this purchase which came in a timely manner,as always."
1,I've been using this product for 3 weeks and have yet to see any results.,I've been using it twice a day for at least 3 weeks and still show no sign of improvement at all.
3,Fungal Solution Floundered,"This fungal solution did absolutely nothing for my toenail fungus, but the price was cheap enough to give it a try."
1,Not effective!,"I can say this product had absolutely no effect on the toe-nail fungus in my case. I tried it for months and saw no results.In fairness, I contacted the manufacturer, Kramer Consumer Healthcare, and I was refunded the full cost of the product by a check in a few weeks...for which I am very grateful."
2,Questionable,I have used this product for a few months on some toe nail fungus and I don't think it is working --- perhaps I have not used it long enough.
3,Fungi Nail that is not actually for your nails,"I bought this product because i have a fungus on my big toe and as i am breastfeeding i cannot take any internal meds. Upon purchase i read the booklet provided and what jumped out at me, was that the product is named Funginail but the info book states that it is not for your nails and will not work if placed on nails. The only reason i have not returned it is because my toenail is hollow and as such i am able to put med under the nail and on my skin. I have been using for 3 weeks now and it seems to be improving. The directions however say not to use for more than 4 weeks which i think may not be enough....but i shall wait and see and update as i go"
2,no change,I have been using this product steadily morning and evening for over a month. I have noticed no change at all. The advertisement does say you should notice some change within this time frame. I have read some of the positive reviews. One person even said he noticed a difference after only one treatment! I can't explain that other than maybe he's the CEO of the company lol.
3,It is for nails,"Someone put a comment: if you read the fine print ""this product is not effective on the scalp or nails."" This refers to applying the product on top of the nail will not penetrate through the nail. The product is applied on the edges of the nail. I've been using this product for couple of weeks and appears to be working."
2,Appears to make nail look clear,"At first thought it appears that the polish seems to be working, however I think it is just a glorified nail polish that makes the toe nail look clear. I have not noticed any improvement. However it can be used as a temp fix if needed to made the nails appear to be normal and shiny."
2,"After using for 3 weeks, no improvement noticed yet...","Disappointed. Believed the hype. It may be too early to notice improvement, so I will update this initial review after 1 month."
1,Oily,"I used a different product that is Acetone based so it dried & disappeared, leaving just the medicine in place. I like it still but thought a different product might be good so the fungus doesn't get immune to it. As you might know, there is NO cure for nail fungus, not even by prescription, you can only control it. This product here is an oil, think what it can do to your socks or if any of it gets on carpeting etc. Also my nails started getting a dark cast to the top of the nails where this was applied. This product is no good."
4,cured of nail fungi,"I saw results almost immediately! The black area on my nail bed cleared up, and the nail itself got back to a normal looking and no longer seemed to lift away from my nail bed. I got this in April and by the end of July my toenail was halfway back to normal,"
1,Lies lies lies... read the fine print it says NOT FOR NAILS,"these guys should be sued for false advertising. On the back of the box it says in tiny print ""NOT FOR NAILS""...Yet its called funginail? Huge rip off! this is for jock itch and athletes foot only it says... don't get fooled"
5,Can't wait to get my own!,"Ok, so I browsed this book in the library, but I just can't wait to get one of my own! I met Sharon Draper recently and as a student teacher she offered me the best advice I have gotten so far. ""Don't let anyone talk you out of being a teacher!"" I have read a lot of her young adult literature, and I just love her. Meeting her only cemented the fact that she truely deserved the title of National Teacher of the Year."
3,Fine print,"Good product, handles surges better then most in its watts class. Works best with the engine running. Load LED's is exactly what it says, just lights. Unit does not shut down when battery level reaches 10.5 like most. It will work till your battery is dead."
4,Books for AS\A2 Chemistry,This book has been of great help to me. It provides all the necessary data very clearly and in an easy to follow format. This book is definately worth considering as a supliment or insted of the set of 4 course booklets at 9 each.
1,Not worth buying anymore,"Aside from Gran Turismo 3 and Twisted Metal Black, all of Playstation 2's killer franchises are going over to XBOX. Plus, XBOX has a total of 40 1st and 2nd party studios making games for it. If you are looking for a console this christmas, look to the XBOX for superior graphics, better DVD playback, high definition gaming, builtin broadband adapter for internet gaming, 4 ports without the need for a multitap, hard drive for saving games instead of memory cards and for storing your own personal game soundtracks on, and realtime DD5.1 all for the same price as a PS2! In other words, the smart buy is XBOX."
1,Did not receive the system we ordered,"We ordered the system with the V3FX steering wheel, DVD remote control. We did not recieve the two items with our order. We also sent an email to the company concerning the two items 2 days ago, they have not returned a reply within 24 hours as they indicated on their web site. Nor have they sent one within 48 hours. So please beware of their lack of supply and response."
5,buy the ETHERNET card and SAVE THE GLOBAL ECONOMY,"Everybody should buy the ethernet card for it console.And the reason for this is that this will enable that more than 10 million people get connected at home with 100Mb conection. This would be great for the entire economy, because the ISP will have more revenue, and also people like Lucent or Cisco will sale more infraestructure equipment... yeah, I know that this could be booring, but this could mean that this console could help to the economy to grow again.So... buy an Game Cube, xbox or a PS2 with ethernet card and enjoy the new internet for games!!!!"
4,Overpriced,You can buy all the parts separately for a little more than half of what they're charging.
4,"A great system, nearly crippled by one flaw","First off Playstation 2 is a great system. Improved graphics, dvd player, and great sound. There still are some things that have not been improved from Playstation 1. Such as the size of the system, two controller slots, the controllers are the same, and the speed is still quite slow.The graphics are very good. They are very smooth and colorful. There is a small flaw in the graphics, they are a bit unstable. It has good sound. Having the dvd player is a plus.(If you don't have on already)Now we come to the flaw, the price. Playstation 2 has a very high price.($300) The problem with them is with in a month a new system is coming out. It call GameCube, it is faster, better graphics, smaller, ect. It starts at $200. Playstation 2 is a great over priced system."
5,This guy from Kansas doesn't know jack!!!!!!!!,"Graphics are the same as the Dreamcast??? Hahahahahah....This system is superior in every way when it comes to Dreamcast. Plus, with the awesome graphics and the gameplay of PS2, this system will rule the Xbox. Blah blah blah, hardware is better in the Xbox, some can argue that when the PS2 reaches it potential, its better than the Xbox. Remember, all are 128 bit machines people. But will Xbox have Metal Gear Solid 2 when it comes out? Will Xbox have Gran Turismo series? NOPE. These titles and a few more is what MAKES the PS2 the PS2. Get it, and you won't be sorry!!!"
4,Chic Eco review - 2002 Edition,"My book is tattered and torn, I use it so often. The company information pertaining to green living allows you to look up hundreds of environmentally friendly companies. Examples of products you can find are anything from 100% organic cotton or hemp fabric, to wool bedding, to chemical free building materials, to non-cancer causing shampoos and body lotions. I use this book as a phone directory several times per week. Great reference for my family purchases as well as my business. I'm a lifer! Delia is an uplifting, very polite person and she thoroughly knows her business."
4,Environmentally In Tune......,"This is an outstanding reference source for those who are interested in purchasing &/or learning about environmental friendly procuts. This directory has been updated several times and provides the reader with an array of creative products which are earth friendly. Delia has excellent taste and this is a wonderful tool for people to acquaint themselves with earth-friendly products for homes, bodies and gardens."
5,Awesome!,"This book is very well written, it gives a very honest depiction of the problems associated with being a single parent. I know John Thorndike's son personally as his summer camp counselor. Janir, now in his twenties, is enthusiastic, considerate, creative and full of energy. A tribute to John meeting the challenges presented to him in his life."
3,Hold your horses...,"Very good book but there's an problem. I would give it 5 stars but this problem ticks me off......The BEA Weblogic evaluation software is expired. I find it amazing that BEA and Sams publishing would ship an evaluation copy that is expired before the book is bought. It should timebomb AFTER installation. I've contacted SAMS and they said ""I am afraid you are out of luck. If you would like to purchase a full version please visit http://www.beasys.com/products/servers_application.shtml""How's that for a marketing scheme ? Yes you can get a eval copy from their web site, but I don't have the fast bandwidth to do a download of that size. This book was only published 2 months ago and the evaluation copy has expired. I bet it was expired before they even shipped the book."
2,"I only use this book as ""Examples""","This book is surely helpful for programmers have understood XML and Java(Servlet or EJB) . But it is imcomplete to explain the relationship Java and XML. So I only use this book as ""Examples for XML and Java""."
4,Not for rookies,"I think many people are missing the point here. The words ""Factory Repair Manual"" on the cover should give you a hint. Bentley produced these manuals for trained technicians to use. This book is not going to hold your hand and talk you through a repair step by step. The book assumes the you have a basic understanding of the automobile. I have found this book to be a great resource many times."
1,Not a good buy.,"Contact me if you have already purchased this book. I would like to speak to you personally. Thus far I also do not think this book is user friendly, and I also did not find the information I needed to make my repair."
3,"very nice, not what I thought",My grandson will be celebrating his 3rd Easter. Since birth I was looking for a similar egg I had as a child. This egg is the closest one I have seen. The price was reasonable. My egg has a smaller spy opening.
4,THE Porsche 356/912 owner's bible,"If you buy any book about your Porsche 356/912, this is the one you should read before and after you buy it. Tells you how to rebuild your motor step-by-step, tells you what VW parts are capable of swapping in, details engine differences by year and type, and gives you insight on female pubic hair thicknesses.I love it - it saved me the trouble of asking stupid questions at the machine shop."
3,Useful but not brilliant.,"This book is certainly an interesting read. It's not particularly well organized and has heaps of typos. The real let down for me was that it doesn't go into enough detail about all of those little details about differences in hardware, shells and finishes. It is still worthwhile if you're a Rogers owner."
5,The Rogers Bible,"If you have any interest in American-made drums,this is a must read. Chock full of info and photos,it's a real page turner. And a must have if you own ROGERS drums. A drummers book written by a drummer-doesn't get any better than that!"
2,"Great Drums, Average Book","Yes, Roger's drums were some of the greatest drums ever made. The book does contain informative information, but sometimes mires itself in irrelevancy. Go down to your local drum shop and look for the guy that looks like he's stil stuck in the 60s; a much better source for information on vintage drums than a corporate publishing machine."
1,Useless,"Save your money. Unless you connect over the same circuit the connection speed is next to zero. I bought this product after reading the Speedstrem liturature touting that it would work in larger houses - over 2000 sf. Mine is 3000. Actually, it only works on the same circuit - say in the same room. Nowhere else in the house can I get a decent connection. Useless."
1,Terrible products,"I bought the 2502 powerline ethernet connector and the 2521 powerline access point. I was adding them to a network which is using two NetGear XE-102 powerline connectors. The Netgear products installed instantly without any software (except to add encryption, if you want). After several hours neither Siemens/SpeedStream product worked. Passwords are required for each device. You have to match to the default settings on the access point for all your devices. Forget it. It's a nice idea to have a powerline access point and I hope Netgear develops one. The instruction booklets are cryptic and useless."
2,"Antiquated, condescending, religious based drivel","This book was an utter waste of time. Every other sentence is some drivel about ""asking god for help"" and ""respecting your husband's place as the leader of your family.""If you are VERY old-fashioned, are a woman with no intention of being independent- either financially or emotionally- then check this book out.If you want to really learn how to get out of debt and the basics of investing regardless of your income, check out ""Smart Couples Finish Rich"" it's the straight forward facts, worksheets, and exercises to actually help you.This author should have stayed preaching her supposed knowledge to her bible study groups."
4,"Polished playing, but somewhat aloof","For masterful clarinetistry and good taste, Ms. Meyer's Weber is first rate. My only issue is that she is often somewhat businesslike in her approach to the music. Weber was an early Romanticist, and much of his musical impetus comes from opera. Therefore, I would have liked to hear more Romantic expressiveness in these performances. Having said that, I still believe this recording is worth having, especially for clarinetists."
4,"Handy, reusable /4.5 stars","Sturdy plastic cable management tool.Among other uses, I zip-tie one of these onto the cables on drills, extension cords, keyboards, etc. It helps keep these neat when storing them.More sizes would be nice"
4,I found this product to be great relief ...,"I found this product to be great relief for bug and mosquito bites! Although it didn't take all the itch away, it greatly cut down on it!"
1,Arrived unsealed,"I've use this great product in the past. It's GREAT stuff. But when I received this order the producet bottle arrived unsealed...no ""tamper"" wrap over the cap and no seal on the mouth of the bottle. It as if it had been opened or filled from a gallon jug or something Ewwww. It might be fine, but I'd prefer sealed product like I've gotten in the past. I returned it."
5,Love this product!,"When i was having major skin issues, this product helped me to clear it up.I mix it with some jojoba oil and other skin friendly oils and it leaves my skin clean and happy!"
3,Product came with a damaged bottle,"This product bottle was damaged when I opened the packaging. Because of the nature of the product (sterlizing soap) I'm afraid to use this, as it may not be sterile any longer."
4,Book's great - packaging not so much,"Book is great - came in terrific shape. Book was well protected from elements wrapped in bubble wrap. However, the box it came in was clearly a used box, and loaded with some sort of unknown powder - soap? chemicals? a bit disturbing and unpleasant to get on my hands, rugs, floors. A clean box would have been much better."
4,Entertaining Canadian Group,"This album was released in 1972. It was initially censored due to it's title ""C*ck On!"" and issued as ""... On!"" The CD was reissued with the original cover art (on the inside). It depicts the group posing naked but for sunglasses and a 'tuck in'. The Song 'C*ck On' was later recorded by Goddo, Greg Godovitz having been the bass player for Fludd. Anyway, about the music... The group is Canadian but the singers Ed and Brian Pilling were originally from England. The Canadian members affected that sound so they sound like an English pop band of the era. The songs are 'AM Gold' sounding and very listenable. The messages tend to be simple and trivial, but the music is entertaining nonetheless. You feel good listening to this album because it is old pop music with generally happy themes. The song ""Cousin Mary"" was perhaps their greatest hit single is still played on the radio today, a testament to the timelessness of this classic album."
2,Cousin Mary is the only real highlight,"The first couple songs are okay, and somewhat reminiscent of bands like April Wine & early Badfinger. ""Cousin Mary"" is a Canadian pop gem. But the rest of this album seems pretty weak & unoriginal. (Maybe other cuts will grow on me if I listen a few more times... or maybe not)For a much better taste of early '70s Canadian pop/rock music, I would suggest The Guess Who, BTO, Five Man Electrical Band, The Stampeders, April Wine, Chilliwack, The Poppy Family/Susan Jacks, Anne Murray, Gordon Lightfoot, etc.But DO get a copy of Cousin Mary some way! Perhaps get the ""Oh What a Feeling"" box set or ""Made in Canada: Our Rock 'N' Roll History - Volume 4"" for a nice overview...."
1,Pieces fall out. Regret this purchase.,I would've been better off buying the decorating comb or triangle for MUCH MUCH less (one or two dollars). The pieces of this product fall out and don't fit well in the holder. I was so disappointed. I had wanted this product for a long time. Now I wish I hadn't wasted my money.
1,So bad made me sad!!,I purchased these thinking they would make lovely sides on my cakes. I have been making cakes for about 5 years and can't stand these things. They don't work correctly or if you are getting it to work they want to slip in the holder causing a mess in the icing. It is not worth the $$
1,Useless,The pieces keep falling out. I have tried many things to keep the pieces in place long enough to do a quick pattern on my cake but nothing worked. This is a waste of time and money.
1,Another useless Wilton product,"Like others have commented, my pieces kept falling out. When I went to use it for the first time on a soft buttercream frosting, the design was so bad after a couple of attempts, I gave up and frosted the side of the cake with a spatula.I also had the problem in that some of the blades were extremely difficult to get into the cheaply made holder.Save your money and buy a cake comb instead. I'm angry Wilton would put out such a junky piece of equipment, and have learned my lesson after three such experiences - read the reviews before purchasing any Wilton products!"
1,Awful!,When i get this the handle was missing so i haven't use it and i'm thinking about trowing it away now after two years of not using it :(
1,Not worth the money,"I found this product on clearance at my local hobby store. Now I know why! As others have said, the pieces fall out of the holder making it impossible to keep them all at the same level. I followed the directions regarding icing thickness but this just made a mess of the cake. The triangles are much better. Don't waste you money on this junk."
1,shows seams and wastes icing,"I bought this to try some different patterns on my homemade cakes. I was very disappointed. You waste quite a lot of icing if you follow the package directions of putting it on about 1/2 to 1"" thick on the sides of your cake so you can scrape the pattern onto the cake. Also, the pieces leave little seams where they match up.For those that decide to give it a try themselves, I recommend using a decorating turntable/cakeplate so you get a continuous line around your cake."
