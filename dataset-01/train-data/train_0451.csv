5,Helpul,I was dieing in my Hydrology and Hydrolics class. The text books that I had purchased for the class was useless. I bought this so I could get a better understanding of the my homework problems by examples. Best Buy Evers.
5,Excellent Guide,"This book follows Shames textbook extremely well, in fact a lot of the homework questions were in it. It was very helpful for studying."
4,Good introduction to the sport for everyone,"It's funny how, because there is a picture showing a woman running up front, that some people assume this is a book soley for women. Not so. This is a nice, rounded introduction to off-road running for everyone. Barrios gives useful advice on gear, technique, etiquette, health maintenance and first-aid. Even more enjoyable to me is her encouragement to see trail running as belonging to a much wider population than just the ultra adventurists. Trail running doesn't have to be only a competitive endeavour -- it can also be a fun way to bring some activity and connection to nature into our lives. It can even be meditative, a nice break from an otherwise frenetic life.Well worth the investment, especially if you are tentatively considering starting in."
5,Excellent Introduction - Realistic Perspective,"What I liked best about this book is the fact that the author encourages people to do what you like and work at a pace that fits your lifestyle. My schedule is constantly changing, so it was encouraging to read about successful runners who don't follow stringent routines. You can do the same amount of running and see the same results, but you can do it without suffering burn-out or making running your full-time career. The workouts suggested were reasonable for the average person and the book was written to help everyone, instead of only hard-core runners. The mentality of trail running is probably the biggest draw, since you can be yourself instead of trying to fit the mold that someone else (ie: coach, personal trainer) has created for you."
3,Frumpy Oxford don at work,"John Dickson Carr wannabe, but again, a first entry in a series. I've heard wonderful things about Crispin'sThe Moving Toyshop and decided to start with his first and work my way forward. I'm hopeful things will improve."
3,"Like the Academics, Not So Much the Actors","A wildly unpopular actress is murdered in Oxford. No one is especially sorry that Yseut Haskell is dead, and no one seems all that willing to track down her killer. Everyone is happy to profess their hatred of Yseut. Literature professor Gervase Fen knows immediately who the killer is, but that will stay under wraps until the end of the book. The mystery is a closed-room case. It seems like no one could have gotten into the room to shoot Yseut.This is not necessarily a remarkably unique closed-room case. It relies heavily on the characters to carry it along. I rather enjoyed the university setting of the book. Fen is certainly not my favorite literary academic, but he's well-drawn enough to keep me entertained. I was less interested in the world of the theater. Actors can be very tiresome. I'm hoping that the later installments in this series dispense with the theater and focus on the university"
4,Dma's Freestyle Flava 3,I'm a fan of the albums DMA has put out. I wanted to add this CD to my collection. .
1,Completely dangerous. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.,"Santa brought me this for Christmas. I wish he'd included bandages in my stocking. The handle design is seriously flawed and as I pulled out the first batch of sauerkraut balls, it snapped, causing the hot basket to fall onto my hand. OUCH. It was unusable after the first batch. Then, due to the design, I had all of the cooking oil that I had to get out somehow so I could clean up the mess and return it. I used a turkey baster and took care of it that way. All-metal construction in the handle as well as a removable liner would improve the design."
2,Not Up To Par,"This product did not satisfy my needs. It took a long time to heat up,and the kitchen smelled like fried foods. I used the ventilation fan above the stove, but it took many hours for the oil to cool down, so the smell lingered many hours as well. For the money, there is a better product out there, and I found it!"
2,web companion,Nice magazine as a web companion. It no longer includes stats and boxscores as in years past. Which makes it a real pain for readers in rural areas with dialup.
1,The true meaning of Christmas?,"I would suggest you watch this movie on You Tube before purchasing. I did. The animation is not good, but I will always forgive that if it is written well. It's not. The grandfather of the two children is neglectful and verbally abusive and it's supposed to be funny??? One star only for the Christian theme, and the moral they tried unsuccessfully to portray. If you are looking for a good Christian Christmas movie, I would suggestThe Very First Noel Christmas DVD"
4,Awsum Follow Up To Ghetto Fab,"Fabolous is now one of the best new rappers, him and ludacris. this album is off the hook. the only boring track is the intro. the hottest track on this is one of the bonus ones, Keepin It Gangsta (Remix)featuring Styles P, MOP, Jadakiss and Paul Kane. Throw Back is also a awsum track. So many good apearances to, Missy, Styles P, MOP, Snoop, and more. any type of rap fan should like this cause fab proves that he can spit real, like on Change Me, Change U and Respect. Awsum album, Pick It Up!"
4,One Step Away....,"Street Dreams is a terrific followup sophomore album to Ghetto Fabolous. For Fabolous, the album is a huge improvement of his debut and really puts him closer to the elite group of rappers(50 Cent, Eminem, 2pac, etc.). The album overall has plenty of club bangers like ""2 not give a ****"" and the smash hit ""This is my party"". It also contains some slow beats like his newest hit ""Can't Let You Go"", featuring Mike Shorey and Lil Mo, and ""Into You"". However, it lacks the ...that separates the winners and the losers. Not saying this is a loser but it's more like a draw or in other words One Step Away! So, I'll say that Fabolous is still an album or two from competing with 50 and EM but if you've got money to burn buy this album!"
3,a little bit to POP,"Nice CD for the Sub Urban Wanna Be THUGS, Presonally I likes Fab's other CDs.Fabolous gets his Ghetto Pass back with his new CD The Mixape More Street Dreams, Fab realy hits a home run on this one."
2,"Fabolous is ill, but street dream is pop","Even though Fabolous is one of da freshest illest rappers in the game right now, and he has mad respect in NYC and the mixtape scene, his second album was straight pop tart. I mean, its made for the ladies and to shake your ass.Its really watered down and has a TRL friendly commercial vibe to it. I mean he has some ill punchlines,but if your looking for some ghetto F.A.B grimey street lyricist young gunna that he is dont buy this album."
4,Tight Album!,"Fab's new album ""Street Dreams"" is his best album by far. I liked his last album but, I think this one is great. I liked all but three songs on this album. Many of the artists included on this album -MARY J. BLIGE, ASHANTI, TAMIA, SNOOP, and P.DIDDY- helped to make this album great. My FAVORITE song on this album is ""InTo You."" All in all this CD is the bomb!"
1,YOU CALL THIS HIPHOP?,i only found 4 songs actually tolerable fabulous is great lyricist but hes making way too many love songs this album was just disgusting i dont know what to say only thing helpful i can say in this review is dont buy this album if you are a true hiphop fan go pick up a 2pac pharcyde NAs or KRS ONE album
2,Sophmore Curse,"Now I have been waitin fo this album since i heard Fab's debut album which was off the meter. This cd ""Street Dreams"" howeva straight [smells.] now im not sayin there's no good songs cause there is. Like 3 of them (Not Give a... Never Duplicated, adn the hottest one Forgive Me Father. the lyrics are so weak on many of the tracks that i wanna throw the damn cd out the window. now i was thinkin...Fab and Nelly show mad similarities after ive heard ""Street Dreams"" 1. both went mainly R&B with their sophmore lp 2. both made songs wit hot beats but had stupid...topics on their sophmore joint(Air Force Ones and Fab's made ""Throw Backs"" 3. both albums are weaker than their first one. So overall im mad disapointed in Fab here, even though he says, ""The Game Ain't Changed Me"" which is [wrong] because it did change him and it changed him in a bad way he turning into Ja Rule(goin from straight gangsta to an R&B [singer.]"
4,A slight disappointment,"The F-A-B will always be my boy, but this album was not all that I expected it to be. I think that the 1st album was a little better. All the lyrics are still dope and no one can touch him lyrically. He even makes comment about his chipped touth. I was expecting more comment about girls giving brain, but like I said it is still a good buy and you should definitely scoop it up.Holla Back, KtB"
4,Decent Sophmore Effort !!! But is it for you?,"Street Dreams is a decent sophmore effort from one of the best raw lyricists in the game. What it lacks from the first CD ""Ghetto Fabolous"" is the raw ""street"" beats to go with the witty, raw flows that Fabolous kicks better than most twice his age. The CD focuses to much on the softer side, almost love ballads, but one worth noting is the track with Mary J. Blige which is fantastic.With that said, the remaining tracks are on point with fresh sounding beats and airtight flows including Forgive Me Father, Why Would I, and Throwbacks!Overall, worth adding to the collection as I am personally waiting to bump it this spring come warmer weather! Fabolous is definately on my top 10 list of lyricists of ALL TIME! Thanks Fab...That's about all this white boy from the BK has to say for now!!! Thanks for reading"
3,Not that FABOLOUS,"THIS CD IS OK BUT NOT ONE OF THE BEST IN MY COLLECTION. IT HAS A LOT OF PARTY BEATS ON IT WHICH CLUE DOES AND THEY'RE HOT, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE LYRICS AREN'T ALL THAT, BUT I DON'T REGRET BUYING IT AND I'D SAY THAT YOU WILL GET YOUR MONEY'S WORTH. I'D ALSO SAY THAT IN A FEW MORE YEARS WITH A LITTLE MORE EXPERIENCE, FABOLOUS' NAME IS DEFINATELY GONNA GET BIGGER AND BETTER!"
5,Not your typical Hip-Hop Album,"Every track on this album could have been a hit single! Fabolous manages to be both authentically ""hip-hop"" and commercially viable in this endeavor. The lyricism is witty and creative. Even though I find most hip-hop these days hardly worth listening to, with this album, Fabolous shows he's got the chops to compete with the big boys."
4,Rap/Hip Hop's future!,"This is is the first time I heard Fabolous! I just bought the CD so I can try new rappers and i was really impressed by his work! Now i m thinking of buying Ghetto Faboulous and More Street Dreams!Now about the Album:It opens with a brief intro with fabolous talking about the album! Then it goes to Not Give A F**k! After listening to the track I was surprised! I only asked one question to myself: ""How come this song is not a single?"" But then after almost every song I asked the same question!! This album is filled with great songs!After the other great rappers (Who r either retired or dead for ex. Tupac, Buggie, DMX and Jay Z etc...) This rapper Fabolous is the future!!!!"
1,"ROFL, THIS IS RAP?","This is awful, rofl, people, you guys dont understand, rap is sh*t now, all these fake artist, fake fiddy, ja fake a$$, seriosuly peeps, u gotta feel the ol gangsta music. PIck up some ol ice cube or tupac or biggie or some one who was real to tthe game no these fake for the money artists. This guy is faker then pam and's boobs and its no lie. No one comin to the game brings anything of interest. The only tru rap left is the O.G sh*T. dre, ice cube, tupac, biggie, wu etc. Gotta cop those, dont waste your money on fake artists"
2,not so good,"this album is... ehh.. just not that good... boring , commercial, popsome songs are downloadable... dont cop this though"
1,Nightmare On Fab's Street,"How can anybody call this guy a rapper?!!! All he does is TALK!! And he doesn't even try to change his tone. Plus he TALKS like he has something in his mouth. His skills are so bad, that he makes Puffy or P.Diddy sound like 2pac. This cd is NOT worth your money or time. A rush job of a cd and not a very good one at that. Pass!!"
2,Fabolous-Street dreams,I think Fab should have done better with this album.His first album was dope but this one is not that good.I think that he might turn in to another ja rule later on in his career.
3,He could do better,Basically the problem with Fab is everything he's saying in this album you've already heard before because it's the same subjects from the last album. The production is the thing that makes the album worth buying. Fab does bring some hot punch lines to Street Dreams but that's about it. Either get this for cheap or burn a copy off one of your friends.
2,This is a Street Nightmare,"When someone comes into the game with such stamina, and the ability to coin phrases (Holla Back Young'n) definately says something about ones skills. Or so you'd thing, however this time around Fabolous practically goes backwards in every department. Flow: Only gets worse, he sounds so bored on most of the songs. Content: Horrendous. How does one go from being a hardcore ..., to a pu**y whipped ladies man? Beats: They're alright, but his collaborations with bad artists ruin anything that can save this album. Then, to top it all off, the track ""Wake Up"" decides to not appear on the album. Why not? We'll never know. The only songs worth hearing are ""I Don't Give a F**k"" and ""Damn"" - Otherwise the whole album is a reincarnation of another Ja Rule wanna be. And Ja Rule already tends to be a wanna be. So basically, Fabolous is a wanna be's wanna be. He should change his name to Fabo-... cause this album is terrible. Verdict: Fab is definately Kazaa material now. No respect."
5,One of the best rap cds now.,"I just got this cd, and it's worth the money. The best songs are ""So Into You"" and, ""Can't Let You Go"". ""Street Dreams"" is 100% better than ""Ghetto Fabolous"". 100%satisfaction is Gauranteed. You'll say the same if you get it. Hope your convinced, because I was when I got it. If you're not convinced check out the awesome songs for it. ""Intro"", ""Can't Let You Go"", ""Into You""."
3,say wat..............,"street dreams? dont think youre gonna get a cd of street anthems here. The title of fab's new cd definetly fooled me. If this is the leader of the next generation of hip hop im not looking forward to it. While theres numerous bangers like ""this is my party"", ""Up on things"", ""keep it gangsta"" and others the majority of its spent with fabolous sweet talkin ladies like lil' mo and ashanti on slow ballads. into you and call me are examples of this crooning and takes the edge off the street theme. While im a big fan of clue some cuts are below par and as this is my first fab album i much rather him on features. Still though its a solid listen for about a week"
4,Is Street Dreams better than Ghetto Fabolous?,"Fabolous's 2nd album is definatley up to par with his first album but it dosen't neccessarily surpass it. There are 19 tracks on here but of course you have those below average tracksbut once you pop Street Dreams in just listen to it all the way through.After the intro the 2nd track Not Give A ...comes on which is probably the best track on here besides Respect,Throwback, Bad ..., that track w/Missy, and a few others. The album starts off blazing but then it slows down until about track 7 or 8. The album is good because even though Fabolouse's monotone voice gets tiring he can still flow about his women, flossin, and other stuff and make it interesting because he uses a metaphor or similie with something like saying he's gonna have a chick swallow his kids like that witch did Hansel and Gretel. Okay, go buy Street Dreams."
1,wet dreams,"i do not know what cd everyone else that did a review on it listened to, but i am very disappointed. i think that for someone who is in such a good position for success, to come out with an album like this is disgusting. fabolous has one of the best dj's in the game and a wide fanbase after such a stellar debut album. i hate it when artist cannot compose their own lyrics. i heard verses from jay-z, dr. dre, and some lines from eminem and snoop. these verses were great when they were originally rapped, but now they are stale and old. all fabolous raps about in this cd is girls and i thought that he was a little more creative than that. while the beats are alright they can only take a song and cd so far. this cd falls far short of my expectations. i hope that his next album is not as cheesy and commercial as this one"
3,okay,"if you felt his last cd chances are you'll be into this more than I am featues lil mo, and jagged edge."
3,"Not His Best, But Good","Fabolous is a respectable lyracist and punch-liner, but 'Street Dreams' just seems to stick to that mainstream sound that I just really cant stand. This production and beats on this album are great dont get me wrong, but just too mainstream."
2,this is just plain wack,alright beats but terrible lyrics and hooks. this is the type of rap that is ruining hip hop.
4,Good but not brilliant,"I liked this album a lot when i first heard it but it got a little bit old. The album starts off with a really bad intro(probably the worst intro i've ever heard) and then goes into Not give a f*** my favourite song. Call Me, Can't Let You Go and sickalicious are all mad songs. But songs like damn and my life with a really bad guest appearance of mary j blige are bad. I would rather go out and get a brilliant cd like lil kim"
4,Faboloso,"This is a good album with some good cuts. I think Clue makes some good beats on this CD. I think Fabolous has good rhymes. If you really listen to how he spits you'll see. I think the CD deserves a 4 out of 5. the track ""Respect"" is bangin and is the best on the album. ""Not Give a ...."" is tight track too. ""Damn"" is an aight track. In between there are some tight tracks with good beats ex: Why Wouldn't I, but those seem to stand out. I think this CD is good."
3,Mediocore Second Effort,"I was actually a little bit disappointed when I first gave this cd a listen... It was like déja vu considering the lyrics of this cd were almost identical to that of Ghetto Fabolous.. How many songs can one write about their kids being all in a woman's face? Apparently, Fab has mastered the art of writing numerous songs to this effect. My other criticism of this cd, is it seems like Fab may possibly lose his street credibility if he continues to put out these ""mainstream"" tracks, such as Into You, w/Ashanti (I love the song, dispite the fact she is one it), and Can't Let You Go... he tries to reclaim it with tracks like, Keepin it Gangsta Part II (smart move to have Styles P in it) and Not Give a ......... Overall it's hard to not like this cd, if you like Ghetto Fabolous, I would just like to see Fab switch it up for his third effort"

5,You are going to love it!,"If you really like Ghetto Fabolous you are going to love this one. It is better then the first one. Of all the new cd's I have bought this is the one I listen the most. Fabolous if you ever read this riview I want you to know you are the best! You met your goal on making the second album better then the first one, but I still love them both!"
3,Faboulous Or Not?,"Ok let's get started this cd by Fabolus is a good Album kinda similar to his first. It has the same party songs with some slow songs. The songs I would recommend if u want to get your party on is Not Give A ....,Call me,Keepin It Gangsta remix,etc.Can't Let You Go is with Lil Mo and Mike Shorey This is a song that u let your shorty know that he or she is really appreciated. This songjust might be a spring/summer anthem. Whereas Into You with Ashanti is a remade song which was done by Tamia a few years ago and If u ask me Ashanti should have never said yes 2 do this song. Fabolous should have asked Tamia do her vocals cause Ashanti messed it up. There is one surprise on the cd and that is there is no number 16 song (Wake Up) y who knows but overall if u liked the first cd u would like the second one."
1,"Yeah, he's a real ""Fabolous"" guy","whem it comes to fake studio gangsters, this guy can be used as a ""fabulous"" example."
1,I Hate It!!!!!!!!! 0 Stars!!!!,"There is a lyric ""girl, the way you cook a steak"". I'm a vegetarian. Don't people have any consideration??"
5,Great protein powder!,"This is for my son who has autism and is 3 years old. He is on a restricted diet, no gluten (wheat), no casein (cow milk), no soy, no corn. I've been struggling to get enough protein in him. The only milk he drinks is rice milk - which is watery and has very little nutritional value. I've tried both rice protein powder and yellow pea protein powder - mixing them in the rice milk - they are both disgusting. He won't touch them. He loves the egg-white protein powder! It makes the rice milk thick and nutritious. And he downs every cup, so it must taste good! I'm so excited! I now add it to the gluten-free cookies and muffins I bake for him too! Excellent source of protein and amino acids!"
1,Disgusting,"this product tasted very bad in my opinion. it didn't matter what you mixed it with or how you mixed it, it still tasted bad. Egg whites as you know foam up a lot when shaken or stired, so it was really hard to try to use this as a protein shake. The reconstitued egg whites from the powder tasted like leather or rubber."
2,It's OK.............,"I thought it was the three together, but it's not, should has guessed by the way the cover photo is,divided, it's OK, nothing to get your chestnuts roasted over, 2 stars, that's all."
3,Marginal Live Frat-Country CD,"I received an advance copy of this CD, and it's a good thing. I wouldn't pay for it. The best performances here are those of Charlie Robison's ""Sunset Boulevard"" and Brother Bruce Robison/Kelly Willis' collaborations, particularly ""Angry All The Time."" Ingram has not reached the songwriting competency level of the other performers, so his material is not as listenable as the rest. This music simply is not as important or as good as the music of fellow Texas songwriting alumni Steve Earle, Lyle Lovett, or Guy Clark. Indeed, of almost greater importance is the ambience of Gruehn Hall, which can render almost any performance memorable."
4,A light-hearted look at a lost era of Japan,"Written in the 1950's this slim book of cartoons gently mocks the culture clash between an American family and post-war Japan. The role of men and women, the importance of gifts and myths and realities of dating Japanese women all get an amusing look.It's a fun quick read and it's intersting to see what's changed and what has not."
2,ugly,"I don't like how this looked on, I was really unhappy with how it fits. I got a medium and it was HUGE on me, and I was hoping a medium would be tighter. it looked nothing like that pictured, the top hung much higher over the panties than pictured."
5,Must have Debut!!,"Despite the obvious influences shining through on this c.d, the songs are instant hits and are classics in their own right. Sonata is not for everyone but those who enjoy melodic, powerful and fast metal should really check these guys out! Ecliptica is raw, fast and Kakko really belts out the vocals. Through time and experience the band have now tended towards a more operatic approach 'its blatant when comparing this c.d to Reckoning night'Dragonforce, Redwine and Lost Horizon fans, this c.d ought to please"
5,Welcome To The World Of Sonata Arctica!,"This band brings depth, quality, and skill to the table for our enjoyment. They can go fast, like Dragonforce, but they also know how to make a ballad. I prefer their harder stuff though, but don't have to skip tracks because it is all very good. Sometimes you can hear Tony Kakko's Finnish accent, but it does not detract from the music in my opinion. I have Reckoning Night and Winterheart's Guild (in addition to Ecliptica) and they are also worth getting. If you like Sonata Arctica's style, make sure you pick up all 3 titles that I mentioned. They are very satisfying."
5,It'll blow you away,"I've heard a lot of power metal, and I love stuff like Gamma Ray and Edguy, but there is a quality about Sonato Arctica that really shines out. The band has a good balance of drums, guitar and vocals, and it just sounds great.Too bad it's so hard to get in the US"
5,Finnish power metal at it's finest.,"Sonata Arctica's debut album not only launched them into success and reknown, but it showed the world that power metal can be about other things than dragons and middle earth. The melodic qualities as well as Tony's voice makes each and every song its own. Kingdom for a heart, Destruction preventor, Unopened, and Replica stand out as well-thought tracks. Sonata Arctica is coming to Atlanta in April, and no way will I miss it."
4,Snow Day Afternoon,"This book features kid-friendly (bright and not too cluttered) illustrations and softly humorous text. Each of the 40 pages (divided into three short chapters) has pictures and just a few sentences, making this a great beginning reader's book or a fun story for adults to read out loud.There is a nice message about variety: Mudge meets and enjoys other dogs; the snowman contest features many different snowman ideas and decorations... Light and simple, but done very well."
5,Charming,"This is a great CD, and a terrific collection with which to introduce kids to the sounds of the Big Band era. We were fortunate to hear the disc recently while eating out, and our kids were so enthused, we're going to buy one."
4,Worth buying,"Ive only played the multi player demo, which is fairly enjoyable, but i think this is going to be one of those games where the single player version is going to rock! Download the multi player demo and the movie of the single player version on the Nova Logic website and decide for yourself. I am totally baffled though, as to why Red Storm Entertainment didnt jump all over this. They really could've done something with the Ghost Recon engine."
5,black hawk up!!!!!,this game to me is the best multiplayer combat ive played to date period!the singal player is fun to play only thing i found abit flawed is the a.i. but if they had made any smarter the game would be imposible to beat.i replayed this game twice now the multiplayer has taken over my life!!!!if you like combat online BUY THIS GAME!!!
1,this game is a joke,"This game blows- pure and simple. First off the AI is the worst i have ever seen in a game. Militia will take cover from your fire, ducking and putting thier heads down. as they do this they will wander into your line of fire and be cut down. Clipping errors are rampant, when you get close to an allied unit your point of view shakes wildly- you get stuck on walls alot too. The graphics are artrocious, and its not my computer- I have a 2.8 ghz p4, 512 RAM and a radeon 9700. when they are at max, faces look cartoony, the animations look stilted and the textures are horrible. The levels are also horribly designed, like they only have two types of levels to play in this game: the first involves you going into a building, killing everyone in it then leaving. The second is where you sit in a building killing everyone that tries to attack..."
3,Overall it's ok,"I don't care much for team play. I like the lone wolf kind of game, but this one does a good job of working within a team. Graphics are really outdated now, but it still plays smoothly. It just does not last long, as you can finish it in a very short time. Wish it had more levels."
1,Nova boooooo,"I have all of Nova games- Compared to Ubi Soft this game is a joke. While everyone else out there is moving forward withgame engines like the Unreal gaming engine, Nova does not spendmuch money at all to make a more pleasurable gaming experience.Black Hawk Down has unrealistic scale, accuracy is [bad], an ifyou get more than five people in a multiplayer game forget aboutautomatic weapons, they will lagg the game into oblivion!"
2,Based on the demo,"I'm really not impressed. Yeah, the graphics are good (if you have the computer to support it) but the overall fun value is very low for the single player mission. It's just a bit too easy to kill the enemy (almost like using auto-aim). How can one shot to the abdomen take a man down so easily? Plus, you can't control how far grenades are thrown. There's way too many scripted elements in the game... for instance, if you don't kill this guy first with the RPG, then you die. If you don't kill this guy that runs around the corner, then the hostages die. It's just too scripted and not a very customizable pre-mission setup."
4,VERY FUN GAME.,This game is a lot of fun.The single player mode isn't the greatest thing in the world but the multiplayer mode is really great.It's a game that when you start playing time just flies! Good game.
5,BHD Gamer 25,This game is awesome! You can use miniguns from black hawks or 50 caliber mounted guns. Before you start a mission you get to choose the weapons you want to use. The internet mode is even better because you can get in nest points and snipe people.
2,not worth it,"I have been playing delta force since the first one, and it seems with every new game nova logic comes out with they get worst. they can't get any worst then black hawk down.If all you want to do is play it offline then your ok, but if your like me and you like the online play, forget it, ... you no sooner get online with it then your back on desktop trying to get it going again, tech support says they will one day get a fix for it, since so many people are having a problem with it, but even on a good day when it don't restart itself right away, it still gives you other problems that make it sooooo not worth playing."
1,Boycott (plus it sucks),"For an event that didn't happen so long ago, this game is cruel. Not only is it unethical, but it's not entertaining either. Although I've only played the demo, I felt extremely let down. This game isn't even original. It's like every other first person shooter out there."
1,Don't buy this game,"I can't believe they are doing a game after those Special Forces soldiers who were killed on that horrible day in Mogadishu(spelling?).These people who designed the game couldn't have picked another country in the world. North Korea? Afghanistan? How about Iraq?This is strictly a respect issue and to make a game off of a terrible incident for this country especially in these times is extremely insensitive and greedy.To those who think, ""well its only a video game"" try selling the game to the families of the soldiers who were killed or maimed."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"This game blows. Not only do you have incredibly stupid teammates, but the enemy is just as dumb, the load times are long and it has limited saves.I love first-person shooters but this one is a total bust. Try Max Payne 2 if you want an incredible fps experience."
5,a truly great collection,"I'm really surprised to see complaints about a collection of hits (16 songs) so nicely priced. Some people are just never happy!Cheap Trick is one of the great rock and roll phenomena that have created such an enjoyable catalogue of music. If any band is worthy of such a definitive collection and a five star rating, it is Cheap Trick!"
4,great pop rock,"but probably not the best Cheap Trick album, and certainly not the only one you need despite containing all the bands major radio hits.Cheap Trick is a band that used to write very good and consistently enjoyable albums from start to finish, and that ain't no lie baby.I'm talking about the first four albums. All classics, and all of them should be bought instead of a grestest hits album. You won't find any filler on the bands first four albums, I guarantee it.I guess this greatest hits set deserves additional credit for including the live version of ""I Want You to Want Me"" since THIS is the version radio stations have been playing for years- not the studio version.All in all, a decent collection, a great band, but pick up the first four albums instead because if you like catchy pop rock/glam rock, you will NOT be disappointed with anything they created in the 70's."
3,SOMETHINGS MISSING,"A great catalougue with an odd ommission (a good rendering of The Flame). Production values are chancey. If you're a huge fan of Chea Trick, I would recommend looking elsewhere. There is great German import, but it must be out of print. It is not at any of the regular places. For a casual fan/minor collector, its fine. Finally, Cheap Trick is one of the most vastly underated bands of that era. Not just for Want You To Want Me, but Surrender, Dream Police, The Flame, All About You, and their covers. Real good stuff!"
2,Maybe someone should've authorized some hits,"Mandocello? Ick!I was hoping for cooler tracks than this. How about ""Reach Out and Take It"" (from the Heavy Metal soundtrack) or ""Voices"" from ""Dream Police?""Don't get me wrong. I do love the tracks on this album. I just thought I would be getting something more comprehensively greatest-hits-like."
4,The best single disc collection.,"""Cheap Trick"" seems like one of those bands like ""The Cars"" that doesn't get much credit, but are totally awesome! This basically is a great collection. The big hits ""I Want You to Want me"", ""Dream Police"", and ""Surrender"", along side favorites like ""Tonight it's You"" and ""Southern Girls"". PLUS a live version of ""The Flame"" and the theme song from ""That 70's Show"". Even though others don't like ""Mandocello"", I really like it. Being a child of the 80's, I would have liked ""Ghost Town"" on here, but at least it doesn't have ""Magical Mystery Tour"" like the other collection does. Overall a great cd, and not getting it right now would be ""cheap""."
4,Authorized Greatest Hits,"Cheap Trick's Authorized Greatest Hits is an improvement over the earlier greatest hits album from the 90s. First of all the Authorized Greatest Hits contains more songs than the earlier hits complation. Second, Cheap Trick themselves, were involved in the compling of this collection.If a single disc, is all the Cheap Trick that you are looking for I recommend this over the other greatest hits. Really, Authorized Greatest Hits will probably please fans, who do not want to buy the individual albums, but like all hits collections there are always a couple of personal favorites missing. I think ""Hot Love"" from their first album should've been on here. Also, there is a live version of ""The Flame"" in place of the studio version, but still if you're looking for a single disc of Cheap Trick to add to your collection this is a good choice.Hits include: Southern Girls, I Want You to Want Me, Surrender, The 70's Song, etc, very good stuff. A good cd to listen to in the car."
4,"5 for content, 2 for style","This book is full of extremely valuable information, but it's written in a very dense academic style. I wish the author had gotten a ghostwriter to help make it easy and enjoyable to read. It has far more meat than just about any advertising book I've read (and I've read a lot). What it lacks, ironically for a book about the business of communication, is the skill at communicating that. i.e. It's steak without the sizzle. What I would love the publishers to do for a second edition is: get a much better title, a much better cover (this one is appalling and boring), ask a good marketing/popular writer to make it palatable for the every day reader, and you might potentially have a hit on your hands. The content itself is first class."
4,"Helpful, but you'll have to do the heavy lifting yourself","This is a decent GMAT prep book. It's worth the money, and will help you get in gear for the GMAT. However, the GMAT is computer-based now, so relying on the books too much is of limited value. It will help you brush up on math and grammar a bit, and get a feel for the questions on the exam. If you are serious about doing well on the GMAT, you need to do some practice tests on the computer.If it means anything to you, I got a 720 on the GMAT. This book definitely helped, because I hadn't done any math for a few years."
2,Oops - I bought this book based on the reviews,"One of Knaster's ethical principles for therapists is to ""not offer services beyond their . . area of competence"", yet she readily presents her personal experiences as American psychological fact. This book may be a good read for young teenage girls seeking guidance, or for women who consider themselves victims of the 'physical repression of American education'. An 'intro to basic psychology' book would be less biased and do more good.She does a good job of covering many types of massage, altho some very lightly (e.g. lymphatic massage in 2 pages) and some with less competence (e.g. distorted view of holistic healing). Do not expect to learn any of the techniques here; it is just an overview. Caution for men: If this book had a version intended for guys, it could be shortened by 200 pages."
3,"Okay, but a little like an advertising brochure","I got this book when I first got my embroidery machine. Her lists of all the types of stabilizer and what they are used for is helpful now (4 years later) but was just overwhelming when I was starting. Her tips are good, but there weren't many projects I was interested in making, and I didn't need a discussion of the types of machines--I don't think it even starts on projects until page 65 or later. In general, I'm a big Nancy Zeiman fan & have several of her books, but this book wasn't very helpful to me as a beginning embroiderer. I had better luck subscribing to embroidery magazines."
2,Very outdated,"Well, this book may have been helpful if it had ANY recent information. FYI, the publication date is 2005. To give you an idea of how outdated it is, it talks about floppy disks as the way to get the designs from the internet. The glossary is also a total joke. It gives definitions to the most basic things. It seems this was written more for a 4 year old or a person who had never even looked at a sewing or embroidery machine. I definitely would not recommend buying this. The only reason I gave it 2 starts instead of 1 is because I shouldn't have thought that a book written in 2005 would have any information that would be pertinent today."
5,A Good Beginners Book,"This is one of the better machine embroidery books available for beginners. It goes through everything from machine types, stabilizers, threads, hoops and plenty more. The only negative is that it is a little outdated in the Design section when it talks about floppy disks...there's no mention of using a USB drive. But it really is only a minor thing. Another book worth purchasing for beginners isEmbroidery Machine Basics - With over 100 Machine Embroidery Tips & Hints for the Complete Beginner. It's not as detailed as this book in that it doesn't cover machine types or include projects but it is a excellent starter book for beginner embroidery machine enthusiasts."
5,"A practical guide that walks embroiderers of all skill and experience levels through tips, tricks, and techniques","Sewing expert Nancy Zieman presents Machine Embroidery With Confidence, a practical guide that walks embroiderers of all skill and experience levels through tips, tricks, and techniques of machine embroidery. Chapters cover differences between types of machines, using software to transmit designs, how to apply stabilizers and tools, the proper steps for a novice to get started, and advanced projects including embellishments for denim, ideal items for babies, decorations for fishing gear, and more. Full-color diagrams and photographs throughout illustrate this ""user friendly"" and very highly recommended guide."
3,"Not an old book, but out of date","Nancy Zieman is a Baby Lock dealer, so this book is heavily slanted in that direction. If you have a Baby Lock, it might be very useful. It is full of very pretty pictures, but not all that much useful information. We beginners need a book that is not an advertisement for a certain kind of machine. What is really needed is a ""Machine Embroidery for Dummies"" type book since the introduction of the Singer Futura and Quantum Futura machines which run off your computer have made it possible for so many more of us to afford embroidery machines. It's a whole new ballgame, and there are going to be a whole lot more players than ever before! Save your money and keep looking for a book with more substance."
3,Okay but not great!,I bought this when I got my Singer embroidery machine. It is okay as far as some of the fundamentals but I think it could give more info for the price. It's too slanted toward BabyLock machines in my opinion. The book has lots of very pretty pictures but I would have liked more information to go with them. I really neither recommend or not recommend it because it depends on what you are looking for.
3,Needs to be viewed in color!,"I downloaded this to my older B/W Kindle and was very disappointed initially. It has hundreds of images in color and some of the charts included are nearly unreadable in B/W. Having a very capable laptop, I thought that Amazon had to make my purchases viewable on something other than my Kindle, and sure enough, it was quite easy to download the book into my pc with it's 17"" color HD display. That improved the read immeasurably! I'm going to recommend the book only to those who can view it in color. There ARE some useful tips, particularly concerning hooping."
2,Got too hot,"Charger got very, very hot when charging but it did charge battery (deep cycle battery). It actually heated up the room it was in. Went to fully charged condition at about 7 amps as opposed to 5 amps that the mfger said it would do. I previously had a Schumacher charger and it worked well for 20 yrs.. I returned charger."
5,Works Great,I purchased this charger to replace the exact same type that I have owned for over 20 years. If I can get the same service from this unit I will be real happy.
2,Not as good as Bananas,"I bought this dvd because I had really enjoyed his edition of the Bananas comedy. I was disapointed because it was the same routine, but not as well done as on the Bananas comedy. Funny material, but I didn't need to own it twice."
5,It's all true...,Somehow we have avoided letting our little guy take this to the shops or to the playpark - but that's about the only time day or night he can bear to be parted from it. A real hit for any little truck enthusiast.
3,The Universal Bead,"Gives a good basic history of bead use around the world, and all through time. If one is into beading, especially jewelery making, well worth owning. The illustrations make the book particularly useful."
3,Spanish Made Simple,"We use this book in my adult education Spanish class, although my instrucor does not like it. She has pointed out several translation errors, and we are only up to chapter 5!"
4,Well done,"You will have to work but this book will help, especially if you know a little but about Spanish. Exercises, verbs, vocabulary. It is worthed. Enjoy it."
2,Had to buy the book,"I had to buy this book for a Spanish class I was taking. After getting a Kindle with the print large enough to see it (which I couldn't do very well in the paper edition) I realize that the stories in it are boring. I guess this is the life of Mr Adams, he seems to be in every chapter. I like stories with a little more imagination."
4,Review by Liz,"As a Spanish instructor, this textbook is one of the best I have found. The price is very affordable and the exercises are fantastic. There are however, a few mistakes, typographical and gramatical."
4,spanish made simple,"This is the ""textbook"" being used by my Spanish instructor at the community center. The class is senior citizens, many of whom have had no previous preparation in Spanish, thus dictating the level at which the subject is to be presented. For me this is unfortunate in that I can already speak the language it is prcatice and expanding my vocabulary that I seek, although I am finding I lack some of the basics that have wandered away from me over the years. The book is in the typical format for language instruction. Reviewing this material that was 'learned' some 45 years ago is not at all harmful to my cognizance of the language and I think I have control over my ego enough to avoid conflict. It seems particularly well-suited in that the vocabulary is slow in its expansion and leaves room for my (personal) recollectiion of words heard over the years and hidden deep in my mind bank."
4,good and simple,Homeschool coop teacher. This is an excellent general simple spanish text book. We are using it at our homeschool coop with a beginning spanish class. The teachers and assistants are all English speaking with a Spanish heritage or background.
4,A bit of a bad rap.,"Certainly not a one-star book. It can be very helpful, but you have to be willling to devote time for memorization. It is not for everyone. This book is very dense in information and will give you a solid background in Spanish, but you must devote time to studying it like you would any textbook, and limit yourself to one lesson a day, or it will frustrate you with all you cannot remember. Also, I do not like the 8-1/2 x 11 format."
5,"A Classic! If you are learning Spanish, you need this book.","This Book has been one of the bestselling Spanish Books for 50 years now! The reason why is that it works. A great complimentary book to a Spanish Students Library.Tom Troughton ""Editor of www.fantasticospanish.com"" ..."
4,just what I was looking for,This was the exact title and book I was looking for and was in the exact condition I expected it to be in. The only problem I had was that it took FOREVER to ship :( but it turned out just fine!!!
5,Best Christmas Album Ever!,"This is my favorite Christmas album ever. I searched the internet forever before I found it on Amazon. The King's Singers are one of my favorite groups. Their musicianship is incredible. If you only have one Christmas album in the house, it should be this one, 'A Little Christmas Music', by the King's Singers. Great for listening while cleaning the house, and as background music over the perfect Christmas meal. Buy it. You won't regret it."
2,Okay for beginner users,"The book might be okay for novice users, but I was a bit disappointed, given the editorial reviews. I have to go to the big Que book for hardcore info."
3,"Not their best, but ok.","While ""The Big Store"" is no where near the standards of ""Duck Soup"" and ""A Night at the Opera"", it's ok. The story follows Wolf J. Flywheel (Groucho) as a private detective hired by Martha Phelps (Margaret Dumont), to protect singer Tommy Rogers.""The Big Store"" has a few laughs in it, but you're left thinking, ""is this really the best the Marx brothers could have done with this movie?"" For the most part the jokes are pretty weak, but the movie itself is pleasant enough."
3,"A Muscial, Not A Comedy","This film essentially showcased the Marx Brothers' musical talents. The viewer is treated to a lot of Chico on piano, Harpo playing his harp, and Groucho singing. But, people watch the Marx Brothers expecting non-stop comedy routines. You know, the typical Groucho one-liners, Chico's con-stunts, and Harpo's sight gags.All right, this film has some of that. But, not enough to keep the fan glued to the screen waiting for the next bit of high jinx. Instead, you get musical numbers up the wazoo and stale comedy routines.This is not their worst picture -- ""Love Happy"" has that infamous distinction. But, ""The Big Store"" is right up there in the flop standings.I have to agree with another reviewer, the Marx Brothers were getting old by this time and their energy level just wasn't there anymore. I give this three stars, however, for Chico, Harpo, and Groucho."
2,Stinker,"I hate to use that word when referring to the Brothers but this movie was dull and uneventful. It's was like no one took the time to write a few scenes/sketches in the classic Marx style that we know and love. The big chase at the end seemed to belong more in a Buster Keaton silent flick and was really not the Mark Brothers style AT ALL. Not as disgusting an effort as AT THE CIRCUS, but this runs a close second as the worst Marx film of them all. (I have yet to see Room Service) Not terrible, just uneventful. Rent before you buy."
2,MGM's Bargain Basement,"""The Big Store"" (1941) was intended to be the Marx Brothers' cinematic farewell. After seeing the finished MGM product, it's understandable that Groucho, Harpo and Chico would reconsider and bow out on a stronger note with ""A Night in Casablanca."" Though ""The Big Store"" has the brothers in good form, it suffers from a weak script and an overabundance of bad musical numbers. Groucho has some great moments as detective Wolf J. Flywheel and his final pairing with Margaret Dumont is memorable. In addition, Harpo and Chico perform their only piano duet, which is one of the film's highlights. Unfortunately, MGM saddles the Marxes with Tony Martin and his awful ""Tenement Symphony"" number - not to mention a silly climactic chase that belongs in an Abbott and Costello movie. It's a shame that ""The Big Store"" wasn't more consistent in tone."
3,It's better than people think.....,"I can't figure out why so many people consider this movie one of the Marx brothers worst! It's one of my favorites. There are so many new stunts in here, like the fantasy sequence where Harpo plays his harp before a couple of mirrors. Soon, his reflections begin to accompany his harp with violin and bass fiddle. There is a quick shot of the mirrors to get that shot of harps into infinity.And the chase scene was good, the dialogue was a little different from previous movies.All in all, I think this movie is underrated."
2,there is a season,"what parts of it I heard were not that good. rec'd cd with large scratches in middle of tracks. tried 3 different players but all jumped around or stuck on same spot. not interested in going thru hassle to return ,just will not buy from amazon again"
3,Awesome on paper but.....,"I love Pride FC, but I have to be honest. This disk, the 1st round of the GP, is a bore. On paper, looking at the caliber of fighters, you would think that this would be the greatest card in the history of mma, but it was far from that. The Shogun v Rampage bout was exciting, and the Wandy v Yoshida were exciting, but the rest were average and the fighters seemed to fight not to lose as opposed to fighting to win. The 2nd and 3rd rounds of this GP are where it gets exciting."
4,total elimination 2005,"the opening round of the light heavyweight tournament in 2005.a lot of reconized fighters such as wanderle silva quinton jackson,dean lister,dan henderson ,shogun rua exc.best fights:1)yoshida vs wanderlei silva 2)antonio rogeiro nogueira vs dan henderson 3)alistair overeem vs vitor belfort 4)igor vovchanchyn vs yuki kondo"
2,Regular,Las fotos no son claras... y los guayos no vienen completos.No quede satisfecho con la compra.
5,Great!,"This is Great! Of course... all of the Evangelion episodes are great. In this ""Project Jet Alone"" goes awry as the giant robot attacks the city. Misato then goes in to stop it. Afterwards another Angel is discovered, and the 2nd child in introduced, Asuka. This is a great way to bring in another character."
5,FOR SONATA'S FANS,"All the songs that sonata's fans are looking for:1- FullMoon(Edit) - No differencies,just shorter. 2- Still Loving You (Scorpions Cover) - Much better than the original Scorpions' version. 3- I Want Out(Helloween Cover) - Helloween classic. Great version. 4- San Sebastian - New song. Fast and melodic. 5- Shy - Fine ballad from ""Agre Pamppers"" demo. 6- Replica(LIVE) - Faster than the ""normal"" version, nice solos! 7- My Land(LIVE) - The best Sonata music (fantastic solos)Great influences from Stratovarius & Hellowenn(with Michael Kiske)"
2,"Insubstantial, flimsy, cheap","I purchase many items from Amazon with great satisfaction. I have purchased three ""button"" hooks in the past few years. I wish I had saved my money (and time)on this one. The item is flims at best. The wire used is light weight, bends and twists to easily. The button hook part is also it is not a complete loop. The base end is open, which gets caught on the button hole.It does have one redeaming quality in my opinion. The zipper puller is a heavier wire, is open sufficiently for most zipper tabs.My search continues."
3,Not what I expected,I wanted this item for a friend who lives alone and had trouble zipping the back of her dress. This does not help with back zippers as I had hoped. Only adds a few inches. Good for front zippers and buttons only.
3,Much Ew-iness,I gave this collection 3 stars simply because I love Phantom of the Opera and wouldn't want to disgrace it. And I'm perfectly fine with Sarah Brightman singing that... but I would rather listen to a dog that just swallowed battery acid howling than Sarah singing Don't Cry For Me Argentina. I mean... seriously. Get a life.
2,Another disaster,"This is my second Sarah Brightman CD, and probably will be my last.After I bought ""Time to Say Goodbye,"" I told myself maybe that tiny, squeaky voice on that CD is an exception to her work rather than the rule. And I figured, besides, this CD is an operatic/classical work, Sarah Brightman should sound different on this CD.Big mistake. The same small, squeaking voice. I just can't stand it. Barbara Streisand sings a MUCH richer version of ""Memory."" Sarah Brightman's version simply cannot compare."
1,"If you want to hear good songs mangled, look no further",*shudder* *shudder* It's heartbreaking to hear good songs mangled by Sarah.
3,-ish...,"Buy CD. Rip to computer. Cut out the Evita and Cats fluff immediately. Send a few more flops to the recycle bin. You have 10 songs left. 5 are great, 5 are decent.That's my story.Worth buying or not? Judge for yourself. 10/16 songs. Not bad but not that good."
1,Awful!,This is the last cd i had to buy before i had the whole collection of her cd's and it was awful! i already traded it in and i dont recommend it for anyone!
1,i do not enjoy her,i did not enjoy this collection of andrew lloyd weber songs. frankly i do not enjoy sarah brightman at all and her voice lacks training and clarity. buy a cd with a person with talent.
2,Just plain not very good,"If you would like to purchase an anthology of Lloyd Webber works performed by Sarah Brightman, I suggest buying ""Surrender: The Unexpected Songs"". It was recorded with the oversight of Mr. Lloyd Webber and showcases both the singer and the orchestrations much more beautifully. The song list is better and more varied.The only advantage this album has is the presence of ""Anything But Lonely"". Brightman's performance of this role (Rose in Aspects of Love) was a critical success and her recording is brilliant. However, this same recording can be found on ""The Premiere Collection Encore"" anthology along with Striesand's recording of ""Memory"".My advice: buy ""Surrender: The Unexpected Songs"" and also buy ""The Premiere Collection Encore"". Don't buy this."
2,What happened on this one?,"The recording quality on this disc is generally sub-par. On one track her voice bounces back and forth between the channels. She sounds like a human ping-pong ball!! I must admit that one thing colors my review and that is that I am not a big fan of show music. I prefer Brightman's more recent works, ""Time To Say Goodbye"" and ""Eden"". ""La Luna"" wasn't too bad, but some of the song selections were rather dull. Buy this one only if you are a huge ALW fan, because Sarah does much better on her other discs."
3,"Good, but not fabulous","OK, Sarah Brightman's voice has really matured from her Phantom of the Opera days. She sounds much less like a cartoon character than she used to. And while I applaud her trying to do a whole CD of Andrew Lloyd Webber's work, she should not have attempted some of these songs. ""Don't Cry for Me, Argentina"" is all wrong for her voice, and ""Gus, the Theatre Cat"" and ""Macavity"" merely on this album to take up time. ""Phantom of the Opera"" and ""Pie Jesu"" have been lifted *directly* from their original albums, and therefore have lost their freshness. To give her appropriate credit, ""Anything but Lonely"" and ""Tell me on a Sunday"" are the highpoints of this album, but this album is only for diehard fans of Brightman"
4,Beautiful!,"This was my first Sarah Brightman CD and I didn't know if I would like it because I wasn't into classical crossover at the time. However, I quickly fell in love with ""Phantom of the Opera"" (and Sarah's voice!)""Eden"" is my favourite Sarah CD, but this one rates pretty high too!"
3,A LOOK AT THE MANY SIDES OF SARAH!,"I fell in love with the Divine Sarah after watching the La Luna video and listening to the La Luna album! But one of my favorite songs that is on the video, The Music Of The Night, is NOT on the CD.So I bought this CD because it has The Music Of The Night on it. I had no idea at that time that she had already recorded albums in many, many genres, so I expected something like LaLuna. And this album is nothing like LaLuna.However, it is wonderful in it's own way. It shows her incredible diversity and unique ability to sing pretty much any kind of song. Now, it's about time for her to do a Country and Western album! LOL! However, if she decided to do one, I'm sure it would be wonderful!The only negatives about this album are the songs Gus: The Theater and Mactivity: The Mystery Cat, which leads me to believe that perhaps I simply don't like the music from Cats, but Memory is a wonderful song!"
1,The Songs That Got Away,I was terribly dissapointed in the quality of the sound production on this CD. The mixers could have done a much better job with this ladies voice
3,Her voice is beautiful but not the presentation,"I love Sarah's voice. Her ""Time To Say Goodbye"" in Andrea Bocelli's ""Romanza"" was out of this world. But I was totally disappointed by the way Sarah presented those famous tunes in this album. She failed when she tried to sing differently from the original singer. Those changes were too dramatic and unnecessary."
1,What a weak attempt,"I felt that this recording was weak and so many of these songs have been done MUCH better on other recordings. If you want to hear Unexpected Song, listen to Bernadette Peters' version! If you want Don't Cry for Me Argentina, buy the American Cast Recording with Patti LuPone. For Memory, why buy Brightman's version when you can hear Betty Buckley's? The Phantom stuff is passable, but you can hear her do it on other recordings...buy the originals! Don't waste your money on this."
5,Wonderful!,"A really enjoyed this CD. I bought it, mainly, for the Phantom of the Opera songs. People sometimes ask her if she gets tired of singing those songs over and over again, but she doesn't. For those of you who don't know...most of the phantom songs (Music Of The Night especially)were written for her. Music of the Night was written for her when she was first together with Andrew Lloyd Webber. All of the other songs were written mainly for her voice. This is a great CD, and it has lots of wonderful songs on it. One of my favorites is Macavity The Mysetery Cat!"
4,The Andrew llyod Webber Collection,"Thank you for the CD, it's condition and the speed in which I received it!"
5,Addicting,"Helen Ward was my introduction to music of the 1930s and what an introduction it was! Ward worked closely with swing master Benny Goodman and the two were a great team. Ward did not have a typical voice from the era; her voice was neither nasal like Annette Hanshaw's or childish like Helen Kane's. She had a mature, full, beautiful voice that kept audiences coming back for more.This CD collection provides information about Ward's life in the liner notes, a valuable companion due to the lack of information about the performer even on the internet.Miss Ward's vocals, however, speak for themselves. Although this collection strangely excludes perhaps her most famous song, These Foolish Things, it overflows with talent sprung through other songs. Some of the best and most entertaining songs include Daddy, You're My Favorite Memory, I'll Never Say ""Never Again"" Again, and Same Old Moon.Do not miss this great CD. You'll find yourself addicted and wishing for more."

3,Antique Magazine,This magazine is a Christmas present to a relative. He enjoys it very much. I have had issues with the publishers about duplicates but that seems to have been straightened out.
4,Good Read,Interesting things I have never thought about before. I am going to say it helped but it definitely didn't hurt.
5,climbing helmet,This is a great helmet.It adusts really well and is very comfortable.I recentely took a 20'+ fall and the helmet took a beating but my head came through fine. The suspension system is much superior to a foam filled helmet but you do gain a few ounces of weight which for me was not a factor.Overall a very goog helmet that I would not hesitate to recomend to a friend
1,WILL NOT WORK ON XBOX 360!,"So disappointed to discover this game and all it's retro treasures are not functioning for the XBOX 360 and there is no backwards compatible update to make it so. This information is not made clear in the description, so buyer beware!"
1,yep. i fell for it too. cant use it on our xbox 360...,i should of read other reviews...dont work on xbox 360 like is says...was a total waste of my money...it was a terrible investment. they should give refunds.
1,"THIS IS A NO GO FOR THE ""XBOX 360""","I just got the ""Xbox 360"" and I didn't know that many ""Xbox"" games don't play on the ""Xbox 360"". Well this is one of them. Now I know for the future that when buying ""Xbox"" games to read all the one star reviews to make sure they can play on ""Xbox 360"" first. I have most of these games on Playstation 2. Now I know to hold onto my Playstation 2 for all of these old games."
3,love the older games.,I bought this game for my mother. She loves it. She really enjoys the toy pop game. The games that are on this game are a lil piece of the past for me. I also enjoyed the games featured on this game.
4,Nice oldies collection,"This game disc has many of the oldies that you ancient folks, like me, will remember playing at the arcade. They are basically reproduced as we remember them. Amazing how we lived in the stone ages isn't it? Still there is much fun to be had and memories to stoke. The original version of Gauntlet is worth its weight in quarters. Have fun with this and you won't be dissapointed."
3,Sinistar foweled up again!,Nice game only...Sinistar is played in a SQUARE playfield on a vertical screen with a radar map on top.In this version the radar is still on top when you have a horizontal screen. this makes the picture smaller than it should be. The radar should be placed on the side for the game to work correctly. I hope they make a PC version with this flaw corrected. The best version of Sinistar is still the old Sega Genesis cart.
3,Truly Classic Arcade,"It has some great original standup classics. I mainly bought it for the game programmer interviews, which seem to be missing from newer Greatest Hits collections. These guys have a large amount of recall when it comes to their contribution to the Video Game Arcade days of old."
4,Great!,PROS: Only way to play these games without X-Box Live$20 for 20 gamesCONS: Need a Joystick to Play a lot of games better.
3,JORDAN 23 EU DE COLOGN,"Not very strong. Although not objectionable, but I expected more. I bought another type of his cologne, from Marshall, it really smelled good and lasted long time."
4,This book should come with every baby!,"I'm only half-way through, and already a fan. This book has helped me relax, and be able to learn my son's unique likes and dislikes, and then spurred me to experiment with him. As a result, we're both getting more rest. My best testimony, is this review: I actually have time to go on-line! I'm sending a copy to a friend."
1,Don't Buy This Book - It Will Ruin Your Child!!,"The advice offered here will destroy your child's ability to trust you and thus the world around him. This book is a pitiful excuse for parenting advice. These methods are for parents who don't want to be bothered with parenting. Parenting takes work: time, energy, patience, love, and much nurturing. If you don't want to nurture a baby - then don't have one. Don't try to make a baby learn to nurture herself - that is your job as a parent. This book also has terrible views on breastfeeding, parental instincts, working mothers, and natural childbirth. Please buy instead ""Natural Family Living"" by Peggy O'Mara. This is a true parenting book."
1,not very helpful,"This book desperately needs to be updated. The out-of-date information on breastfeeding alone was enough to put me off (eg, that breast feeding has not been proven to be useful immunologically, etc). I did learn some new techniques my baby uses to self-soothe (sucking fists, etc) and I am relying on the pacifier a lot less, but overall the book was a big disappointment. I can't believe T Berry Brazelton has his name on this! Really just another person in the cry it out camp."
2,Brazelton is not an author; he just wrote the Introduction.,"Amazon.com's listing of this book is a bit misleading. Brazelton is not an author of this book; he just wrote the Introduction. I would not have purchased it if I had known this in advance, as I had never heard of Sammons (the real author) before."
1,LOUSY advice,"This book was shockingly outdated with rather bad information. Strangely, it is anti-breastfeeding, or at least not very encouraging of breastfeeding, and even misogynistic. There is not much offered as far as technique to help those babies who really need lots of touch and want to be constantly held (the help I was looking for). He doesn't address the tougher questions. Sure, if a baby is fussy it's ok to wait it out and see if he calms. But what if your baby is wailing? This book does not address how to teach the baby to self calm. He also talks about ""communicating"" with your baby, but it's all very vague."
1,Save Your Money,"The book promises to teach parents how to help their baby calm his or herself. Chapter after chapter just says, ""and once you learn how . . "" It's just a tease. Basically the author wants you to let the baby cry for a while and see if the baby can control his or herself. Duh!!! All parents try this. Waste of time and money."
1,Extremely bad information on breastfeeding,"This book contains misleading, inaccurate, and downright dangerous information about the importance of breastfeeding. The author asserts as fact that there is no significant difference between breastfeeding and artificial feeding, despite reams of medical evidence to the contrary. Visit my web-site, and in particular, the page entitled ""Why Breastfeed"" for a small sample of medical journal citations demonstrating that there are serious health risks associated with artificial feeding. My web address is <http://www.clark.net/pub/activist/bfpage/bfpage.html&gt"
2,read with caution...,"I bought this because when my son was a few weeks old, he wouldn't sleep unless you held or rocked him. I bought this book in August and have not finished reading it. It has a lot of useless information plus the breastfeeding part is bogus. When you finally do get some useful info from it (towards the end of the book), it makes sense. But be warned that if your baby is only less than 2 months old, I think they can't self-calm at all because developmentally they are just too immature. 3 months is a good age to start, plus as a lot of books suggest this is the time they ""come to terms with themselves"". Read this book with caution. I've taken some ideas from it and adjusted it to my son's personality and my style, but I can't say I totally agree with the author. Remember, although you can read millions of baby books, the best thing to do is to ""LISTEN TO YOUR HEART"" because if you do, you can't go wrong."
3,Pinkish white,"Husband is a WSU Cougar, so I purchased this set for him. Only complaint is that the white ink looks a little pink due to the red tshirt. If you are in between sizes, I would go up."
5,An inspirational book!,I had the privilege of being in South Africa with Freeman Patterson on a workshop recently where I was introduced to a copy of this book. I took it to my room one evening and was taken away into another place by the incredible images and artistry that Andre' has masterfully put together in this wonderful book. I have long admired Andre' and Freeman's book Photo Impressionism and was thrilled to have a book that focuses on the montage technique. The images are inspirational and the text is clear and helpful to those who are desirous to try this fun technique. I strongly recommend this book!
5,Dream on,"Have you seen a countless number of photos ? Are you a little bored about the typical landscapes, close ups, portraits, nature, sport images ? Are you looking for a new dimension to express yourself by photo images ? Yes ? Then this book will be the right one for you ! This is not a book to show you the latest manipulation technics with your digital equipment. This book beams you in a new dimension how to change your photos into ""art"". Andre Gallant shows 4 different ways to create ""dreamscapes"". Combining of unrelated images, inverting an image, in and out focus technics, vertical and horizontal combinations. There are a lot of examples for each of these technics and the results are amazing. I'am sure this book will start a creative prozess in your mind no matter if you are a digital or analog photographer."
5,Using on workbench with magnifying lamp with adjust arm,"I lost the original clamp that came with my magnifying lamp with an adjust arm. I purchased this as a replacement clamp. I am pretty happy with it.The dimensions are the following:Height of black part of clamp: 86.5 mmLength of adjusting screw: 90 mmDiameter of hole where lamp inserts: 17 mmDepth of hole where lamp inserts: 35 mmMy lamp's base that inserts in this clamp's hole is 12 mm diameter and 40 mm long, and it fits just fine in this 17 mm diameter hole."
3,Experimental... straight up weird,"But good enough to keep your attention if you're willing to let it. The first time I listened to this album I made it about two tracks before shutting it off. It took a long time for me to even give it another try, but when I did, I liked it much better. Its not the sort of CD you can listen to in bits so its excellent for long drives. Some extremely funky, cool stuff and just some straight up weird stuff. If you like ambient music this is a good choice, if you don't..."
4,great for a FSOL fan,"Although there are a lot of songs in this collection, there aren't many that stand out to me. The ones that do though, are very good. Chances are that if you like another FSOL album, you'll like at least a few songs on this. That makes this release great for any FSOL fan who wants to hear something different from the group. Don't have high expectations though, because none of the songs are as complex or beautiful as the ones on Dead Cities and Lifeforms."
3,Someone left their synthesizer running..........,"It's O.K., nowhere near as good as ""Dead Cities"" or ""Accelerator"". It tends to ramble on like an untethered kite."
2,Completists will care,2 1/2There is little here worth savoring unless one is simply a Lifeforms obsessor and wants everything from that period.
2,Not Happy with This DVD!,"This DVD was scratched, and skipped! Bought it for my granddaughter, and she was so disappointed, she could not watch it. She was able to watch just enough to peak her interest, and then it started skipping and she could never finish it."
5,I'm a child at heart.,I really love this show. I was going to buy it with the collection but I did not feel like it. I really love this show. Brings back memories.
3,Looks Bootleg,"This is definitely a bootleg DVD version of this movie, but it does the job. Great Christmas movie so I'll give it 3 stars."
2,The worst of the Rankin/Bass Shows,"The story was not very good, and the songs were not very catchy. Plus Amazon's instant streaming of it was poor quality.Best to watch the other holiday shows."
2,too for poverty,i love jack. but not the towns people. there are poor in spirit. they are avoiding ancertors and family togetherness. not a family choice film.
3,Trying too hard?,With the success of Rudolph etc they went a little over board with this one. Not a real relatable character but a cute story for older children (since it talks about love relationships).
4,Great Groundhog Day Movie,"This really is a Groundhog Day/winter video, not a Christmas one. With all the great Rankin/Bass classics there is no need to squeeze this into your Christmas collection; rather, keep it hidden until Groundhog Day to whip up some more holiday fun. I just showed the movie to a class of third graders and they really liked it, but the ending did shock them and pretty much went over their heads (as did half the humor in the show). Nevertheless they laughed at ""Dommy"" and all the bad guys and pretty much followed it all the way through. Basically, it's a fun video and you can't go wrong with Rankin/Bass and Buddy Hackett tunes."
1,Not like the other Christmas classics,"I rented this based on the 4.2 overall rating at the time. I and my family were discouraged. This was not at all the quality of the Christmas classics we come to enjoy this time of year. There just wasn't a moment of interest in this for us. Save your time and money go for Frosty the snowman, Little Drummer Boy or Santa Claus is Coming to Town."
2,Has this movie got what it takes too beat the the other ones,Everyone is nuts this movie stinks I like Jack Frost the oringal film not this one it's to dinky!
5,great classic !,I think this should be in everyones collection. :)great classic.delivery was awesome... and great price.THANK YOU !~
4,jack frost is the man!love it,love jack frost reminds of when my children were little! we used to sit around the tree and watch our fave christmas stories and this is definitely one of them!
5,good movie,Bought as a Christmas gift for my oldest Daughter. Very good product. I was very pleased and my Daughter was very happy.
5,Holiday Movies,i added this movie to my holiday collection. the only thing i regret was waiting a bit longer to purchase because it was cheaper a week after I bought it and received it. funny huh =)
2,Jack Frost Falls In Love,"Buddy Hackett lends his voice to this claymation winter story as a groundhog narrator. Jack Frost falls in love and is willing to give up his immortality to win the girl he secretly loves. Will winter last forever? This plodding, overly long story misses the mark in creating a magical, mystical personification of winter. My own kids left in the middle to find other things to do. Perhaps if the characters had been more lovable and less self-absorbed this would have been more fun. Oh, well. Can't win 'em all."
2,metal detector,Shipment was very fast - product wasn't what it said it was- I sent it back to them immediately and after 2 1/2 weeks I am still waiting for a full refund.
5,Adjustabilitiy makes Bed Risers versatle!!,Finally a solution to my problem. I use the risers on a table. I had only been able to find 1 height and they were often too high for my needs. Now I have a choice of heights depending on specific uses since the height needs vary. The risers are very easy to adjust. I did need to read the directions and presto -- success. I highly recommend them if you need lower risers OR sometimes have varying needs.
1,obviously I am not a princess!,I could ot get my bed frame to stabalize on these - it kept slipping out of the risers. Basic in theory - but I could not get my frame to work with them.And I so wanted to sleep up high like a princess. Right back to pauper status for me.
4,Works well,"I needed a set of adjustable risers and these do the job well. They're a bit ungainly-looking, but are sturdy and easy to adjust."
5,Do; exactly what they say they do.,Fulfilled the function I bought them for perfectly. Easy to install and adjust. Word word word word word word word
2,"Good idea, but not the most stable engineering","I like that these have different height options. However, they took some time to figure out as the directions weren't all that clear. They also tend to slip if you move the bed. Once they slip, they don't want to stay where they are supposed to be."
5,Surprised,"It is nice when something is exactly as advertised, but in this case what was received was exactly as presented. Meets my needs perfectly. Fast response, too. Thanx"
5,Very solid product,"I've had these things for over a year and I have to say, these things are amazing. I have a king bed with 6 support legs, so I had to buy a set of 6. I am a heavy set guy...so I was worried that these may not be able to handle the weight of the mattress, myself and my wife, but I was pleasantly surprised. Plus, for ten bucks...how can you go wrong."
5,Amazing,"People often ask me why we pay so much for a bottle of balsamic vinegar when it's only about $5 in the supermarket. One taste gives you the answer! It's nothing like that stuff. A good comparison is using ""real"" wine (drinkable) over cooking wine (yuck). Also, this will last us many months in salad dressings, vegetable flavoring and even on vanilla ice cream--delicious! Go ahead--try it."
2,Center gage leaves much to be desired,"The gauge is well made and suitable for use BUT with Withworth/British Standard threads the thread pitch is in inch units. The Scale provided on the Gage is in mm. This makes the scale useless. Further the double depth of cut table is for 60 degree threads not the 55 degree used on Withworth/British Standard threads.However while it would be nice to have these things they do not interfere with its use only its utility.I have purchased three 55 Degree Center gauges so far. None is quite correct.One, made in china was poorly made an useless. This on is much better. I have actually bought on made in England, which is best but lacks the correct table, in fact it lacks any table.Jim B."
1,"Danze D225525, D225525T, D227025T","14 months ago I bought and installed 2 Danze bathroom faucets with a rubbed bronze finish. They were very expensive and looked nice at first but soon the bronze plating begin to wear off around the aerator and the drain. The aerator is difficult to remove for cleaning and needs to be cleaned almost daily to keep water from spraying in all directions when the water is turned on. This week the faucet, not the plumbing under the sink, began to leak copiously. When trying to troubleshoot the problem on the telephone with the tech. rep. it was clear that although he bragged that he had been working at the job for 5 years, he didn't know anything about the construction of the faucet. He even insisted that the aerator and the piece that holds it into the faucet were 1 piece, even though it was clear that I was holding 2 pieces in my hand. He insisted that I didn't know what I was talking about. Would never buy another Danze faucet."
2,"Stylish and functional, but short-lived","The upsides: This is one of the few high-rise faucets I could find that wasn't absurdly, ostentatiously high. The extra height makes washing dishes much easier. The nozzle puts out a nicely diffused, almost frothy stream. It doesn't pull out or return quite as easily as other pull-outs I've installed, but it works, and the high-rise design makes the pull-out function less necessary. (Can't get my wife to push the nozzle all the way back in after she pulls it out, though.) The single control handle works very smoothly. It doesn't have spray, but it does have a nicely diffused stream.The downside: The internal seals gave out after about two years, pouring water into my under-sink cabinet. I couldn't find a way to replace the seals. So I bought a Price Pfister. Doesn't look as pretty, but it cost half as much and I bet it lasts 20 years."
1,"Danze Sonora, Not good quality, Falling apart after 2 months","Bought this thinking that a high price faucet would be made of high quality parts, was I wrong. This unit is only 2 months old!1.Spray head will not stay in the slot, keeps falling out.2. Handle comes loose and falls off"
5,"Great, while still being published, anyway.","I would highly recommend this magazine to anyone interested in the aquaria hobby. However, I've just been notified that they are stopping publication of this magazine and that my remaining issues will be fulfilled with issues of Dog Fancy, which is a bit depressing."
4,Super Quick,"Amazon gave the usual 6-12 week delay warning on subscriptions, but the first issue of this magazine arrived in less than four. The subscription price was an offer I couldn't refuse. I bought and read several issues of this magazine in pet shops prior to subscribing. It seems to provide a good balance between articles for those new to fish keeping and the more experienced."
3,Mostly ads now,Its an informative magazine with good pictures but most of them don't have the species names on the pictures. It highlights mostly salt water and has more ads than content. I am not renewing my subscription. I can find more information on the internet.
2,poor quality,"I ordered this magazine on a $5.00 per year Amazon special and still thought about cancelling it...but in fairness, or ordered it for the pictures not the articles and the picture quality is very poor."
3,Aquarium magazine,We like the magazine very much. But we only recieved 1 issue and then we never recieved any more. Could you check on our order and send the magazine . Thank You Joyce B.-Swift
1,Worst magazine,"There is no doubt that this is the worst aquarium magazine.It is uninformative, and covers stuff everybody knows. this magazine is a waste of time and money, and is inaccurate"
4,"Good magazine, but...","I love this magazine, I do. But alot of the time I feel like it should be titled ""Saltwater Aquarium Fish."" Most of the fish talked about are saltwater species, although they do have freshwater on occasion, and the topics covered can get a bit repetitious. However, this is one of the few aquarium magazines out there, and it does have excellent information for the hobbyist. I highly recommend this magazine for any fish lover, especially if you have children. The section exclusively devoted to children's questions doesn't make them seem insignificant to adult's questions -- instead, they treat the kids with respect, as the future of the hobby. Kudos for respecting all questions, from every age!"
2,Mainly for beginners,"In my opinion, this magazine used to be better than it is now.I stopped subscribing when it got to the point that the great majority of articles were clearly written for rank beginners and very repetitive of other articles in recent issues. I don't need to read yet another article on how to take care of guppies or explaining what a barb is.Also, as with most hobby magazines, there isn't much copy editing or fact-checking.Another beef I have about this and most other aquarium mags is that a large proportion of the articles are about tropical reef organisms and reef aquarium issues, when keepers of reef or other marine tanks are only a small percentage of aquarists. They, and we, would be better served by moving this material to specialized salt-water publications.On the other hand, Aquarium Fish does still have some good writers on certain topics. You just have to wade through a lot of repetition of basic information to find them."
2,Geared for kids,"My biggest problem with the publication is that it is overly focused on kids. Letters often include 10 year olds proclaiming their 5+ year fish keeping careers asking questions that are stricly beginner fodder. Aside from the occasional article on a newly identified species, the rest is info you can just get on line. Let me save you some money....In a year the magazine largely covered the following: make sure you know about the fish you are buying before you buy them, make sure you have the right parameters in the tank, and make sure you have compatible tankmates."
3,Good for permament use,"I bought this as a rear view mirror for my computer at work. It worked well until I moved and the sticky backing no longer works. I've had other mirrors where you could move the mirror around a few times before it loses it's stickiness, but not so with this mirror."
2,Haven't used them...,"Ordered them based on they were rectangular and fit into the corner of my mirrors better than circular versions. However, can't peel the damn top piece off so I can actually put them on. Have even tried razor blades to cut into the foam sticky backing. No bueno. :/ I'm sure they'd work well if I could use them."
2,Not the best choice,"I was using ovoid mirrors similar in size to the Hotspots mirror for years. When I could not locate a replacement of that style, I tried the Hotspots Convex Wedge mirror. For my purposes, it was a bad choice. It does not have the far angle viewing ability of competitive mirrors and it is extremely limited on the vertical field of view. Contrary to some beliefs, vertical view is important. For some people, it may be the right choice, for me, not so much. I give it a 2 rating because the glue has held to the mirror. I am now using the Camco Wedge, a considerably larger mirror for use on a pickup. The Hotspots mirror now has duty on the riding mower."
3,Didn't work in my application,"Installing this on a mirror that is properly set up to detect blind spots did not work for my application. I ended up getting the round adjustable 2"" convex mirror that did a much better job. This thing only showed me the side of my car, which is not what I needed. Google how to correctly adjust your side view mirrors and you'll see what I'm talking about."
3,Could be better,"These little mirrors are real life savers, but this one could be a good 30% bigger, and one of them was immediately scraped off in the car wash, so a stronger glue is also needed."
1,"Great mirror, but double sided take WONT PEAL!","This a product that should be that hard to get right.Nevertheless, this company got it WRONG.The mirror is a good size, and even has a good degree of convex; however,the tape that is supposed to hold the blind spot mirror in place would not peal off, at all.I will keep the mirror because its not worth the hassle.Thanks for the hand mirror."
5,Save Your Life,I guess some 'high end' automakers are now incorporating these blind spot mirrors on original equipment. I'd always put one on my vehicles.
3,Nice but really big,They are very nice but way too big for even a ford f150 truck side mirrors. They look small on the picture but are bigger than a mans hand
2,Not worth it or useful,"I bought the 1.25"" x 2.25"" stick-on wedges. I placed them on the inside bottom edge of both driver and passenger side windows. No problems with installing and they seem to stick well. After trying them for a week, the bottom line is they are too small to be useful but just large enough to be distracting. They actually made it harder to drive safely."
2,It only comes one...,"I ordered one for my new truck before a trip. To my surprise, it only came with one: I assumed it would come with a pair and I was in rush. It is a low tech piece of plastic, nothing extraordinary. But $3.59 for one small piece, it is not cheap. I ended up buying a PAIR from Autozone for about the same price."
1,only one?,"when i shop my local store, what i saw is all of those mirror come with pair, however, this one only come with one, i think they gonna track people.and shipping take too long."
2,"Terrible, terrible visibility","This mirror falls far short of expectations. I put one each on my Honda Accord rear view mirrors, and neither of them did the trick. On the other hand, they block off about 25% of your car's own mirror and replace it with a tiny reflection that is hard to see. It just makes visual noise and driving more dangerous. Don't buy this. Just buy the wide angle mirror (see my other review)."
3,Close but not quite,"The hot spot is a good quality product. There is no distortion in the mirror. It's just a little bit too small to be effective. If you could find something about an inch wider and a 1/2"" higher it would work much better. I installed the hot spot on a mid-sized crossover."
2,Hot Spot Stick On,This is a second review. It works but the round stick on mirrors provide a better view of thearea in question.
3,too large for a sedan,these are too large for a corolla (or any sedan for that matter). they will cover half of your mirror and they're actually too small to be your main mirror. If you want a hot spot mirror for a sedan buy a smaller one.they're ok for trucks as they will cover a smaller part of the mirror.
5,A Must to Read Book for All Ages,An excellent and easy to read book about the basic structure of every living organism.I fully enjoyed reading it.It is a great book for anyone who is interested in science and wishes to unlock the secret of life.It is simple and informative.
5,Fun for anyone,"I bought 2 books for my kids and boy where they happy. They loved each story and colored pictures from the book, which now hang in their rooms. I recommend this book for anyone even adults. I colored some pages myself."
2,NOPE,"after having all of the new gameboys out it's so much more advanced....i just got the gameboy DS which has a double screen and you can join players up to 4 players all together without any wires!you can also e-mail people within 300 ft. apart,and by the way you are taking this information from a girl....u wouldn't expect it"
4,Nice & Heavy,"I've bought two sets of the Yamazaki Madonlin Ice. The handles are kind of a dull frosted silver and the rest is really shiny. These are nice and heavy. They come out of the dishwasher very nice. They recommend not using detergent w/lemon in it to clean these. We have noticed that if you pick up your plate and the utensil is hanging over the edge too far, they have a tendency to flip off your plate, I guess this is due to the fact that the handles are very heavy. I find them to be nice and yet not too fancy for everyday use."
5,Easy Listening,"This is the first time I have purchased Mike Rowland's music. ""My Elfin Friends"" is so easy to listen to that I plan to purchase more of Mike's music."
5,Relaxation at it's Best,Need to relax; de-stress.....try this CD. I have trouble sleeping and every night I put in a relaxation CD to lull me away. This is one of my favorites. Also have many other Mike Rowland CD's. Mike definitely knows how to play you a lullabye.
5,Emily Dickinson Lives!,"I chose the book because a friend is an Emily Dickinson fan, I'm a mystery fan, I was charmed by the author's sketches, and delighted by the snippets of Dickinson's poetry. What a fine discovery! The characters are complex, subtle, and interesting. The college town setting is vivid. The plot had unexpected twists and turns that kept me guessing. I learned something about the workings of dams and reservoirs, and I learned something about Emily Dickinson and her poetry, enough so I followed up ""Emily Dickinson is Dead"" by reading her biography. This was my first Jane Langton book. She has managed to do what a lot of writers only aspire to -- her writing is so transparent I forget the story and setting were coming to me through print on a page."
1,I DID NOT like it and wouldn't recommend it either.,"""Emily Dickinson is Dead"" is one book that I didn't enjoy out of the 4 on my summer reading list...what a slow beginning. The title made it seem like it was a book about Emily Dickinson, but instead it was about a conference to celebrate the 100th anniversary of her death.... that didn't include women and a fat girl who tried to kill a pretty one (who disappeared anyways) by burning down a building and who ended up being killed...what about Emily Dickinson HERSELF??? THAT'S who I thought the book was going to be about...not a bunch of confused people. I didn't expect it to be a biography or anything, just not what it was."
1,Not worth it,"Well, this was dissapointing for a few reasons. 1. The DVD format is non standard, you may want to make sure you have either a computer with DVD or many different DVD players to try and play it on. It may or may not run on your machine. It took multiple trys but finally got it running on a Macintosh computer. 2. The presentation was much too short and not in-depth enough for our likes. The Run time on the case says 1 hour and 10 minutes long...not sure what planet these folks live on but this was about 20 minutes at best.Hugely dissapointing, spend your money on some other product. How come there's no 0 star rating available, this surely qualifies for this??"
1,bermuda travel video,I ordered this video as a surprise for my parents for their suprise cruise to bermuda .We all sat down to watch it and it did not work. It never did anything it stayed on the first screen . Very unhappy.
5,Awesome,"Book arrived in excellent condition, I love the way this book is worded. Hardback is a plus for me, I am very active and tend to be rough on my things. I believe this book will benefit all sentient beings."
5,A Trustworthy Guide,"Greg Shea and Bruce Gresh have done the homework for those interested in understanding and improving the health care issue in the US.In four concise and well reasoned scenarios they have layed out the complex intersect between health care and the costs and benefits to consumers. Their anaylsis is a starting point for critical discussions for the future of American health care and this monograph should be required reading for anyone responsible for designing a better response to this enormously important and expensive segment of our lives as well as for us, the average consumer ."
1,Save your money. TSO is a chatroom masquerading as a game.,"As someone who has playtested this, I can safely say thatthis game in the state that its currently in, will not be complete for potential players to invest in this by its rlease date. It can barely handle 16 players at any particular site.The game content is boring and and the objectives pretty shallow.Why invest in a timecard for a game that is really a big chatroom when there are online places to chat for free?"
2,all part of the Sims Online Cult marketing strategy,"here's the business plan for sims online in a nutshell: entice new members with false promises. get them to invest substantial amounts of time and money in the game. by the time someone realizes how stupid the game is, the investments put into the game dissuade one from quitting.this card represents a three month commitment to the game. i got bored with sims online after about 7 days, gave it two months to grow on me before i cancelled (which, btw, is not an easy process thanks to the Customer Retention Service specialists working the overloaded EA phone lines). DO NOT commit to three months of this cult at once."
4,Very fun game,"Alright, first thing, it's not a rip-off...I've been playing this game for 50 days now, and I still like it. Yes, it is like a chatroom, but that's not all it is. You get to go visit places, meet new people, and there are many routes you can take in this game. You can become a millionaire or a slacker, a grand pianist or a master chef, the owner of your own house or become a roomie. The sales are showing that people obviously still love the Sims...I think you should at least give this game a chance. If you don't like it, that's you. And if you like it, be glad you listened to my review and not the person who thinks this is a rip-off :-)"
2,A 3 month time card for a game thats a chat room,"Please hold off on purchasing this.The games release is not far off and having play tested it, I can guarantee, it will still be quite buggy and in need of many many patches after it goes live. You certainly shouldn't invest in 3 months of playtime until you know the game will be stable enough for you to get through."
2,yes it's addicting but...,"ill give it two stars just because the game is okay. why put it online? all you basically get to do is talk to other people in a chatroom while playing. sure there's other perks, but The Sims is so extremely diverse now with 5 expansion packs, you dont really need to play it online. Much worse, have to pay ... to play it for 3 months. wouldnt you think that charging ... for a game would entitle you to playing it online for free? im just thankful that other online games havent done this yet. (knock on wood) You can waste a good 7 hours playing the sims and not even notice it. Now Maxis is trying to capitalize on this and take advantage of all of us. It's a great game mind you. But i dont want to be charged to play it after i already bought the game. I hardly think that paying all that extra money is worth the few perks the online edition gives.but hey, that's just me."
1,Pay?!,"Yep, thats right...The Sims online is not free to play online. Thank goodness i hadn't purchased it yet because the idea sounded awesome and i love online games. but not when i have to pay to play online. Hopefully the other companies won't try and capatilize on this idea because that will ruin any fun we have left playing games."
3,diamonds in the rough....,"Everything said about this game is true...it's a giant chatroom, an addictive game, and a total ripoff, but I've met some really cool people by playing this game, which makes it worthwhile. Whenever they're online, we have a lot of fun playing...most of the time we're laughing our heads off at people who take this game so seriously and can't distinguish game-life from real-life (it's just a GAME people!).But seriously, one of my friends can't get out much to socialize with other people in real-life because she's recovering from chemo, so she plays the game to have a bit of fun and meet other people online to do everyday things that she normally can't do regularly, so it's cool in that respect. However, I'm giving it 3 stars because unless your friends are online at the same time you are, it's one heckuva boring game and it's fee is pricey, but hey, the fun I have on here is worth the 33 cents/day. :p"
2,"Good, Loses mad points for length","Lil Bow Wow in his debut shows that he does have potential. So when I heard Doggy Bag, I was extremely disappointed in him. He said stuff that actually made you think. I want him to succeed, that opens the door for many other talented people. So on his third album, he needs to use his potential."
3,L,first off Dre don't write his own lyrics... second off he's a kid making a bigger impact on rap than Dre is at this point... big up Bow Wow make it happen. I give him 3 for being a kid and having to put up with JD
2,He's annoying as hell!,"Okay, I'll admit Snoop was creative with this project, but Bow Wow's potential is being wasted. His voice, quite frankly, pisses me off as it hasn't broken yet and he sounds like he's whining, and the tracks seem to have been made to appeal to 13-year old girls and not the main hip hop goers that he should be aiming at. He has got potential, but he should have started when he matures a bit and can be ebven deemed hardcore by listeners and not some...kid. The best song, obviously, is 'Bow Wow (That's My Name)' with Snoop. That song shows he can make a song with Snoop and sound hardcore enough, there should have been more songs like that and not like 'Puppy Love' & 'Ghetto Girls'. And whats up with blotting out all the language? You can hear the swearing has all been taken off, particularly in 'Bow Wow (Thats My Name)'. Probably because the target audience would be 'offended'. Bow Wow needs more production and imptroved lyrics and he may be fine."
2,Huh??,"Aiight, first off, I don't really respect rappers who don't write their own lyrics (that's what makes rappers like 2pac and dr dre stand out in the first place.) If what I heard is true, that this kid doesn't write his own lyrics, then fine, I believe that its worth listening to. Truthfully, I've only heard like three tracks of his, and they all sound pretty funny actually. A 13 yr. old kid talking about how he's all the stuff and all that. Is it worth listening to? Well, if you want to waste maybe 5 minutes of your time, sure, why not."
1,Shocking,"Ok, this cd is bloody appauling. I thought it would be good becuase he's Snoop Doggs nephew. But I was WRONG. A lot of the tracks use the same lyrics as Snoop does which is stupid. He's ten or something around that age and he raps about how hes a gangster. Don't think so. If you want some good hip hop go for A Tribe Called Quest."
1,What the hell is this,This has got to be one of the dumbest CDs I've ever heard. Since when did it become cool for a 12 year old to act like a thug just to be 'hip' and rap about girls before even reaching puberty? The music is nothing but dry unlistenable splotches of sound with little effort thrown in. Don't buy this garbage! End of story!
1,"Lil' this, Lil' that","Hey, I'm wondering why all these stupid bling bling rappers have the ""Lil'"" stupid thing in their names. Well, I have come up with a solution. Why don't Lil' Kim,Lil' Romeo,Lil' Bow Wow,Lil' Wayne,and Lil' Zane form a group called, ""Lil' Everything."" I mean, Lil' Bow Wow cant rap much better than California Steve (my friends will know who I'm talknig about),a bum in my town. How many licks?0 that's how many.Lil' Wayne, Lil' Zane? What's the diff?Lil' Romeo? Michael Jackson? Same Thing.They could use Minime. I'm Out."
2,garbage,"this kid is garbage, don't buy this cd. i admit some songs are alright and he does a decent job for his age but still...the cd isn't worth buying. first cd i ever bought when i was in grade 6. i'm entering grade 10 now and don't even count this cd in my collec tion of 31 cds."
3,THIS CD IS O. K. FOR A YUNG STAR,"BOW WOW DON'T EVEN OT 15 SONGS ON HERE, BUT IS STILL TIGHT GHETTO GIRLS"
3,has potential,"I thought Lil Bow Wow would deliver a hot joint. His single Bounce with Me was tight but the rest of the songs on the album are either mediocre or okay. Guest appearances by Xscape and Snoop didnt really help that much. I think he needs to improve on his writing skills because I know that he didnt write any of the songs in the album. Nevertheless, its still a solid album. I wouldnt really suggest it but if you like his current single, then might as well get it...."
5,Wow,"wow, I just bought the cd yesterday and let me tell you it was da bomb. There isn't one song that i didn't like they were all good. Well i guess we have to give it up to Jerimene Dupri and Snoop Dog for helping bow wow accoplish a great cd. well for all you haters all i got to say is your jealous because you ain't got what he has. peace"
2,Write a review w/o...,"For goodness' sakes, 95.5% of the reviews on here use words like 'tight' and 'da', or stuff like u and reeli-'cutesy' stuff. Write a real review.Let me be upfront-I don't think it takes a lot of talent to become a rapper period, but this kid had very little substance in ANY of his songs. I think that maybe, hopefully, Bow Wow can improve as he's much older now, but even with me 2 years younger than him I realize that this is complete garbage. He's rapping about being a pimp when he's not even 5'0 or reached puberty. Bow Wow is not a pimp now or then. His songs make no sense and they make him seem extremely self-centered. Also, I don't think this is even RAP. I consider this more hip-POP."
1,Awful!,"This is not music, it's rambling, this isn't even good for rap, which generally sucks with a few exceptions. The lyrics are idiotic, there is nothing more than a stupid beat, every song, and I use the word loosely, is the same and for some reason people buy this garbage and make this kid a millionaire. What ever happened to talent? There are so many people out there that have talent and can't get discovered because they aren't just throwing together some stupid rhymes and dancing around like morons. Bow Wow, like Little Romeo has no talent whatsoever except pulling one over on the people stupid enough to buy this crap."
5,best album from bow wow,i own beware of dog and doggy bag and i think beware of dog beats doggy bag. every track on this album is nice and nobody can hate on this album. this dude would wreck lil romeo in a battle.
5,Tight,It is the best cd ever Im going to make a shought to Tristan Preston Rhys Darnell and Beta club sucks
5,One of the greatest cds.,"This cd is great, i recommend buying this cd. If you like JD, Da Brat, or the new Lil Bow Wow you will love this cd!! Get it!"
5,Awesome,"This cd is awesome.Much more enjoyable then ""Lil Romeo"".His beat and lyrics are awesome and he is very talented.all the songs i think are just awesome.Curse free too!It is denfinately not just for lil kids or young teens i think he is cool for any age group.i think it was worth every penny and i plan on buying his new album in december too!It cant hurt to buy it and it is DENFINTELY worth the money!Please go buy it =D"
1,Worst,"The worst Cd I've heard in a long time. This kid is record company production. People say ""oh his lyrics are tight"". This litlte 12 year old doesnt even write his own material. If he did, then I would give him some credit, but anyone can rap lyrics that someone else writes for him. So my recomendation is that you go buy some real hip hop, and pick up the new and Old Proz and Conz. Or visit them at ... They are diffinately worth buying. 100 X better then this unoriginal commercialized ..."
5,BEST CD EVER,If you don't like this CD then you must be crazy! Lil Bow Wow is so talented and he has so many famous artists that he features in his songs!
1,OMG Bow Wow is such a loozer!!!!!!!!!!!,"He thinks he can beat the ish out of tha best rappas in teh world Chingy, 50 Cent & Lil Romeo when theyre have MUCH more talant & emooootion as this gay dud. Besides, he's in leauge with tha ""best"" that I say WORST rappas eva!!!!!! Need I say ANY good complimentzzz?!!!"
4,Bow Wows da bomb,"this cd is the tightest. even if he dont write his own songs, theyre still awesome. Puppy Love and My Name Is r the best songs, and the rest are all good too. the only problem is theres only 11 tracks, counting one remix and an intro.Otherwise, if u want a tight rap cd, Bow Wows got it right here."
1,he doesn't deserve the credit hes getting.,"lets get one thing straight. lil' bow wow doesnt even write his own lyrics, JD does. its like his homework, take the lyrics and memorize them and bring it back to the recording studio. so basically, i can be a music artist. if you want good hip-hop, listen to common, the roots, talib kweli & hi-tek, mos def,etc.those are the artists that will always give their absolute best performance on the mic."
3,beware of dog,lil bow wow proves he has talent on this cd. his only weakness is he can't write his own lyrics.as an emcee bow wow lacks originality and creativity considering jermaine dupri writes his lyrics. but i'll give bow wow respect because jermaine dupri cannot execute his own lyrics as well as bow wow can. the songs which really stand out on this cd are bow wow (that's my name) and this playboy. the guesty appearances on this cd are all great and all add to the cd. the r.o.c. is my favorite because of all the similes and metaphors he uses. the beats on this cd are all good mostly keyboard like on the dog in me or basss like on you already know. my favorite beat is on bow wow ( that's my name) which uses bass violin and dj scratching. if this cd was longer it would also be better. 30-40 minutes just isn't enough. if u wanna hear a curse free hiphp talent cop this cd. peace out.
2,"Would've been one star, but he's only 13","Like the title, this CD just plain sucks. He's only 13, which I took into account. You might want to check it out anyways, it's a good listen if you're bored to tears."
4,"So far, So Good!!","So far every song he's dropped from this album is tight. I mean, he has 2.3 million copies to prove it. So, despite what the critics think, Bow is a very talented artist for his age and I'm sure he's going to get even better as his career progresses. Not bad for a little rookie!"
1,Uh Huh.,"Great, another ""singing sensation"" under thirteen. If you want to listen to a girl rapper, get TLC's album ""Crazysexycool""- oh! He's a boy! Sorry, I forgot because, listening to this, anyone with ears would assume the opposite. Snoop Dogg might have been looking for a talented young rapper. Well, he found a YOUNG rapper, but as far as the talent goes. Let's just say this is hip-hop at its worst. P.S. It sounds more like pop than rap."
3,Different from movie-SPOILERS,"This is better than the movie because it does not establish that the kid is Superman's son, it is Lois' husband. Unfortunately, this forces Lois to be the killer of her brute assailant using leverage. This unabridged version gives all the characters back story, even the ones you already know all of their back story. It retreads the same ground for those just starting to follow this franchise, so there, it drags. It gives Luthor proper due. It's revealed he was the one who baited Superman to go in search of Krypton where he was supposed to die. Good audio, great for long car trips."
5,"poetic, inspiring words while keeping true to the latin",Chadwick is both able to keep the meaning of the orginial latin and able to keep the rhythm of Augustine's poetic words. The book itself is inspiring even to those who do not practice the christian faith. A real charmer for anyone who both enjoys poetic language and philosophy!
5,The Sublimity of Augustine,"Before the Reformation; before Trent made Catholicism, Roman; before Orthodoxy split with the West; there was the orthodox catholic (universal) church in its earliest form and one of the Church's best witnesses was Augustine.This writing, which is a humble autobiography, is the most sublime of that first Millennium, and I think - still the finest Christian autobiography. He is not unctious and he doesn't rant. He makes theology seem so easy and God so near.Find the answer at the beginning.Augustine takes us to the limit of human understanding in theology, which becomes humble obedience before the One, who still holds the great mysteries."
2,Excessive,"An immensely boring book which despite being only 305 pages long took me in excess of 2 years to finish. Heavens, but some people have a gift for flogging a dead whore. His musings on the nature of time, though, were interesting, as were the observations on the nature of physical world. It was also interesting to note the manner in which one engaged in reasoning in his age. The degree of tedium he can bring to an otherwise possibly interesting subject, however, cannot be overstated."
2,"Interesting historically, bad theology/philosophy","As a non-believer, some of the more entertaining bits were Augustine pining that he wishes he'd been made a eunuch as a boy, and describing at length the sensual dreams that aroused and tormented after he gave up his lecherous ways and escaped the lesser torment of marriage.Interesting historically as a document of how Platonism was explicitly wedded with Christianity, but some of the theology is a bit strained, i.e., his exposition of Genesis chapter one in which he attempts to explain how God created everything outside of time and without any effort, and yet this took six days and he rested on the seventh. His attempts to solve the problem of evil also do more to confuse the issue than to clarify it, but that is to be expected.But it is definitely far better in terms of both literary style and quality of thought than the efforts of today's believers, and it is worth reading for anyone interested in intellectual or religious history."
1,Very disappointed,I ordered and paid for this book but NEVER received it! I had to spend the money AGAIN and order from someone else. I don't know what the problem is but this is NOT a good way to do business!
2,Victims Don't Count,"He gets a girl pregnant, moves in with her for 15 years, and gets the urge to wander. He keeps his son, dumps the girl, and joins the church as Mommy desires. His ""ex"" goes back to Africa, perhaps to die as a prostitute-turned-old-beggar, and he moves on to conferred glory after conferred glory. Not the stuff of a Saint."
2,"Great book, poorly transcribed (Kindle Ed.)","This is a great example of Amazon's growing tendency to speedily add more books to their Kindle library without actually doing their readers (and authors) the service of proper editing. This is a good book, but Amazon.com should be ashamed at the crummy editing. All the capital H's in this work are actually two capital I's with a dash in the middle (I presume this is a 'smart' scanner error). Sometimes this means that an H is actually split onto two separate lines. Punctuation is missing in scripture references, some words are misspelled, and some of the footnotes are incorrectly ordered. This is the kind of garbage that will cause Kindle to fall into disrepute over those who actually want clean and correct editions of a text. A massive failure, Amazon. I didn't buy a Kindle so I could get short changed on crappy editions of books. If I wanted discounted books with errors, I'd shop at an outlet store. Very disappointing."
2,Disappointed in the translation. Good explanatory notes,"(Chadwick translation, Kindle). I do not read Latin so cannot make an expert judgment. But after a few chapters I gave up reading this translation. I found it clunky and difficult to follow. I read the old hard copy I have (Pine-coffin) which was much smoother. It allowed me to get a better sense of the text. I compared paragraphs occasionally and never revised my opinion. On the upside, the Chadwick edition has extremely useful and copious explanatory notes, which brought out the neo-Platonic sources of Augustine's ideas."
1,A mental midget,"I've written reviews of this book before. They keep getting deleted, so if you want to know what I think of this book, please e-mail me."
1,Hate to Give it One Star,"Is there an option for zero. The worst I book I have ever read. He contradicts himself in his points, hoovers over stealing pears (and other evil things) and puts me to sleep. I don't see how this piece of garbage could make anyone a saint, it should be burned. ZERO STARS."
2,tiny print... WHY?,"Great literature. I can't speak to an obviously great work of writing because, this book arrived today.. I opened it up ,and what do I find? The publisher has decided to use extremely tiny print. There are fairly large margins and the print is compressed and tight. To read this, ( at my age of 47 ) will require a magnifying glass. My glasses can't make the print readable. I'm extremely unhappy. It is unfortunate that there isn't a way to preview the size of printing prior to getting it in your hands. If I can send this back, I will.If you are young and have great eyesight, no problem."
4,great book for beginners,"Hi. I am new to Kabbalah and love this book. I cant put it down and Im not an avid reader. It explains concepts in a easy format, helping the reader learn about the Kabbalah."
1,"Pretty, but check for leaks.","This set looks beautiful, however the bottom of the carafe fell off while heating sake. It may have been a defective piece so I am reluctant to blame the seller."
1,Leaks!,"Beware. My sake set leaked. I have contacted the seller, but have not heard a single thing back. I assumed that it would be easy to exchange for a set that doesn't leak, but apparently I am wrong since I haven't heard a word from them."
1,chipped,"One of the Sake cups was chipped, I would rather have a set that was not chipped. Why would anyone want a chipped Sake cup?"
5,Thomas kaseidoscope,The kaleidoscope was well worth the money. My kids really enjoyed looking at it and we sent it in an operation christmas child box.
3,OK I'LL GIVE IT 3***,"Maybe I have a change of heart or something, I have no f***in' idea. I'll be honest with you people, I don't still understand how this music became popular, was it because he played at the Sept 11 concert, I don't know, I can tell you it's truly a publicity step up to the plate, for sure. Every time I here the song 'Superman', I feel like I've been hit with kryptonite, or even like I just wuss out on a fight with a kid still in diapers, or even just feel real weak, maybe that's the whole point, hell I don't know, because he just sings it too damn high, almost like the way Coldplay sings 'Fix You', don't like it, not normal, grow some cohoanies for crying out loud. But since I have this album (even though I inherited it from an ex-friend, as you notice I said ex-friend), and don't want to butt-hurt the rest of the crowd here I gave it 3 stars, probally too late, oh well."
5,Poorest Marketing I've Ever Seen For Such Talent,"The marketing gurus for this album should be fired. Every song is great and you find yourself playing this over and over. First album with more than one ""one hit wonder"" in a very long time."
4,Promise,"I never thought I could be reminded of ""Moondance"" by Van Morrison, with the music of today until I heard America Town by FFF. Of course, I wont compare them...that would be apples and oranges, but songs like ""jainy"" ""easy tonight""and of course the popular ""Superman"" have given me hope that the Songwriter and the Song can yet again be Harmonius. In these days of the MTV machine and ""Media Blitzed"" music, this album has brought an air of timelessness and hope to music fan wanting to listen to music. Mind You, its not perfect, but FFF holds so much promise, i am anticipating their next body of work. I have yet to see them live, but with the performance I saw, Im betting its going to be a good show."
2,ONE HIT WONDER,"THE RETURN OF SINGER-SONGWRITERS?Well,kinda.David Gray may be exceptional as a singer/songwriter,so are Ryan Adams,Pete Yorn,and Rufus Wainwright.But how aboutJohn Ondrasik a.k.a Five For Fighting(it's like a Nine Inch Nails suitation,folks)? Well,kinda...""America Town"",Ondrasik's major-label debut,went to #54on the pop charts and went gold due to the lush lullaby ""Superman(It's Not Easy)""-a top 15 hit as of this writing.But after listening to ""America Town"",I wonder if ""Superman""is the only quality song he can come up with.This album isextremely underdelovoped.It's needs more stucure.With the exception of ""Jainy"",there's no other song on this album thatreally soars.So it's sad to say but it looks like after ""Superman"" runs its course,Ondsarik will be a well,one-hit-wonder.But that may change if he comes up with a better album,next time round.For the meantime,I recommend:David Gray's ""White Ladder"",RyanAdams' ""Gold"",and Pete Yorn's ""Songsforthemorningafter""."
2,Pretty poor,"I have only heard the singles off this album so maybe I shouldn't be talking, but I just had to get a word in. To me it seems that FfF is just a poignant acoustic pop band, trying to emulate their betters such as Jars of Clay or even Dave Matthews. Their chord progressions and arrangements are about as run-of-the-mill as it is possible to be, and their lyrics are just plain dumb (""you were wrong, you were right""- huh?) Spend your money supporting a less-hyped artist who deserves it."
1,"It's been done before, and much better too.","What a boring album. The lyrics are trying too hard to be smart, and are filled with tired cliches that nearly everyone has heard and have also grown out of years ago. I have a hard time believing that this singer even believes what he's saying. The guitars are just backround, minimal, monotonous, and quite awful too. Save your money, and if soft songs dealing with relationship is what you're looking for, look somewhere else, it's not hard this day in age.This album is just a prime example of filler."
1,MY GRANDPARENTS WOULD LIKE THIS,"this cd is SO boring. all the songs sounds the same. the best song on the cd is probably ""Micheal Jordan"" just because it doesn't sound like all the other songs. like as soon as i get a cd i listen to the whole thing. when i got this cd i could barely handle the first 3 songs. if you like boring-put-you-to-sleep music then this is the cd for you. and if you don't then i definately don't recomend this one."
5,Quality American music,"In a day when talent is not a prerequisite to celebrity, it's refreshing to hear a new release like ""America Town."" I just bought it last night, and am thoroughly satisfied with the musicianship, variety, and good old-fashioned talent displayed by Five for Fighting. I highly reccommend this to fans of acoustic rock and the singer-songwriter genre. This is a complete album... every track is quality."
5,Just like their concert - great!,"Saw them warm up for Train - very similar style to Train, but with lead vocals like Fine Young Cannibal's lead dude. So catchy in concert, I had to have the CD and it's nothing if not wonderful! One of the few CDs my office can enjoy as a group..."
4,A Beautiful Ride,"This is an album for Gufs fans I believe. And vice versa. I love this for what it is: a ride through emotions with a voice so unique it's tough to turn away from.gufs fans should be listening to five for fighting. five fans should be listening to the Gufs.It's a beautiful world, and these two bands make me see that."
4,Five For Fighting Reign Victorious!,"Five For Fighting signed with Columbia Records and released ""America Town"" on September 26, 2000. ""America Town"" went virtually unnoticed for more than a year after its release until the melodically soaring ""Superman (It's Not Easy)"" was adopted as the anthem for the heroes who emerged in the wake of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. Ondrasik's high pitched, emotive voice atop songs portraying genuine heartfelt messages make for a formidable opponent in any battle. The only flaw contained in this album shows up in the form of a song entitled ""Michael Jordan."" Below, please find the rating for each song individually:Easy Tonight - 10/10Bloody Mary (A Note On Apathy) - 10/10Superman (It's Not Easy) - 10/10America Town - 9/10Something About You - 9/10Jainy - 10/10Michael Jordan - 3/10Out Of Love - 7/10The Last Great American - 8/10Love Song - 7/10Boat Parade - 7/10Alright - 8/10Do You Mind? {Hidden Track} - 4/10"
3,Solid songs...Wobbly CD,"Like many others, I really liked the song ""Superman"" so I bought the CD.The CD in and of itself is really...not solid. The CD as a whole isn't very good, however when a song is good...its GOOD.Superman is such an example.Love Song is amazing too. It's about a child's point of view when his parents are getting a divorce and everything about the song (lyrics and melody) are totally fresh.I enjoyed the Last Great American and Easy Tonight was alright.Jainy was pretty great too...I'm not sure it was really worth my money to get the whole CD, but I'm glad I have it, and if you've got a couple bucks to spare and you REALLY liked superman, give it a try! maybe you'll like the stuff I didn't."
4,Great Breakup Album,"There are only a few missed notes on this album: America Town and the Last Great American are (as others have mentioned) pre-9/11 angst; whereas the (slightly) more hard rocking Michael Jordan just doesn't seem to fit the overall mood of the album.That being said this album has more to offer than just Superman (though that alone is a good reason to buy America Town).Easy Tonight, Alright, Bloody Mary and Something About You are along with Superman great songs with Easy Tonight and Superman the standouts.Overally--a great album to have with you during a breakup."
3,The song Do You Mind,"While I find the whole cd amazing and somewhat soothing, along comes this different voice at the very very end of th cd. I'm trying to recognize this voice, thinking hmmm is that Ashley McIssac from Canada's East Coast?? Could anyone email me plz the answer? Ty"
4,an acomplishment,"Recently, art has found it's way out of popular music. I don't know why it has; perhaps, people are tired of sentimentality; perhaps, they want escape. Music is art and art is not about running from problems but rather about facing and, ultimately, conquering them. And even though ""America Town"" is wrapped up in a tidy pop-rock suit, it touches on such biting topics as suicide and the plasticity of modern politics; even apathy makes an appearance among the themes. Lead man, and thus far, only man, John Ondrasik weaves standard love songs through politicaly satirical songs and the album comes out as something that very seldom emerges in the shelves of the record stores; it is a record that displays both accessibility and literary merit. It will be interesting to see what comes in the future from this gifted man who seems to be the only one who cares about the fate of pop music."
2,one more review,"it's ok. if you have an extra ten dollars to spare and like receiving mail in the mail box go ahead and get it. it's interesting bathroom material. don't really know what the last review was all about. the dude didn't like the magazine. why waste time doggin' someone else for their thoughts. looks like a little moral superiority on your part.anyway, get this if you can't spare the extra change for sports illustrated."
2,Just Meh...,"Not that great of a magazine. I picked it up for $5 over xmas 2011 and will not be renewing at the end of the subscription. The magazine is 3/4 advertisements and the articles when you can find them are poorly written, bland, and pointless. I've seen better writing in Highlights for kids. Save your money."
3,Not what I expected,"Cologne samples and pages after pages of advertisements featuring waifish men with skinny legs and sunken chests. This is what's passing for a men's magazine these days? The covers are dead good but beyond that, see GQ or Esquire for a magazine with more substance than scent and show. My boyfriend was sorely disappointed in this one."
3,Details,"Not nearly as good as it was in the 90's. Arena, out of Britain, still has an edgy fashion vibe and lots of current music scene articles."
1,Nothing but ads...seriously THAT'S ALL THATS IN IT!,"Reviewing the january 2013 issue.... 113 pages... 60 pages are ads... 16 pages are cover shoots to promote products, so 76 pages of ads... 16 more pages of poses with ZERO content. 4 pages of a story introduction with no content..so basically right off the bat we are at 96 pages of worthlessness. Take a look yourself! I mean your paying for NOTHING! Im paying $1.00 per month for what?... 17 pages of print? WOW! what a ripoff!"
2,"Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty models.",There are lots of attractive males in this magazine that are usually wearing nice clothes. And there are some interesting articles once in a while. But the advertisements are aplenty. Even more than some gaming magazines!That's all you see every 2 pages or so!That gets boring after a while...Good thing I didn't pay for this subscription. :^D2 stars.end note: the title to this review kinda copies a song by Fefe Dobson. :^-D
2,Not a big fan,"I recently got this subscription for free because of my GQ subscription. I'm not a big fan of this magazine - it seems to be entirely made up of ads for high-end fashion with few substantive articles or anything really worth my time. If I ever want to look at pictures of clothes I definately can't afford, I'll flip through ""Details""."
3,Kind of Boring,This magazine doesn't really have much to it. I'm glad I got the subscription for free!
2,too metrosexual...,I used to subscribe to Details many years ago...before the days of Maxim and FHM. It used to be a decent magazine. I guess after being a subscriber of Maxim for many years I am biased now.
1,"next to no content, but plenty of ads...","When I was in high school Details was a pretty cool magazine, lots of cutting edge stuff was featured and for some one who was a dork gave some interesting style tips.I recently resubscribed and gotta tell ya that I wasted [money amount]. The articles are almost never more than 500 words long, and usually ""think"" pieces that seem tossed off while the author was in a cab on the way to the editorial meeting.A lot of pretty ads though..."
4,A wanna-be serious magazine for folks with ADHD,"Jeff Goldblum's character in ""The Big Chill"" said that he couldn't write an article longer than the average person could read during a, er, ""trip to the library"" (wink, wink, nudge, nudge, know what I mean?). The writers at Details seems to have the same marching orders. In these hectic times, maybe that's not so bad. The articles I have read are well researched and nicely bite-sized. I actually finished the entire magazine between PM mail delivery and breakfast the next day. The topics they covered in my first issue ranged from fashion to health concerns. And, again, they cover the topics in very few, well-written pages. I do think the models look like under-fed children but at my age, that could be tunnel-vision (grey hair, I remember Filmore East, you get the picture?). My suggestion, take a look. It's a magazine with an interesting voice and it may be for you."
1,it [...],"in the early-mid 90s, Details used to be the best magazine in the world, with a huge focus on music. the writing was sharp and witty, and it reported on the latest trends months before every one else knew about the trend. then at some point in the late 90's they tried to become like all the other boring magazines out there (maxim, stuff, gear etc.)after that switch, they lost it. no matter how hard they now trying to be a younger mix of esquire and GQ, the magazine lost it's coolness factor."
1,At least 90% ads,"Unbelievable amount of ads.For $5 a year it is ok but do not plan on much real reading material.A few good reads but unless you plan on spending $3200.00 on the jacket they recommend so that you are fashinoable do not plan on much help with clothing ""details""Completely out of touch.....but on the up side, with all the cologne ads it is the best smelling magazine ever."
2,"LOTS of ads, nice pictures, not much substance","I got this subscription free as part of an Amazon promotion, and now realize I would not subscribe to Details if I had to pay for it. BUT, if you're looking for a lot of nicely-photographed ads, some nice (airbrushed and Photoshopped) pics of celebrities and models, and quick-to-read articles that lack any real depth, this is your mag! But why would you pay for it? You can see all of this online at dozens of websites for free. While I still love holding and reading a great magazine with terrific photography, in this case I vote for ""Save a Tree."""
3,???,I got this on Black Friday and I still keep getting renewal envelopes from Details. I still wonder if I was renewed at all. I guess I will find out.
2,Ehh...,"a couple good articles here and there, but the amount of adverisements are insurmountable, like 104 pages of ads before you even get to the ""contents"" page. 85% of each issue is basically ads for cologne, clothes, etc. i got a free subscription when i bought something off amazon, i will not be re-upping, not even for 8 bucks."
1,THE Magazine for the Self-Centered Male,"If you're the kind of man who looks at himself in a full length mirrror every morning, this is the magazine for you.If you think the car you drive defines you, the clothes you wear are the measure of your self-worth, the watch on your wrist tells the value of you as a person, and the woman you're seen with is a measure of your rank in society- you need this magazine.Other men- who might value human relationships- may profitably give it a pass."
1,Try something else,"If one wants to get to know about Islam, F.E. Peters is not the person to get your information from. He presents many parts of Islam but he presents them in such a way that it would turn a person off of Islam. Some things are complete lies, and Peters does a good job of putting suspicion in the right places while leaving out key points. I've also experianced Peters first hand, I took a class on Islamic Societies he taught at NYU. If one wants to see Islam from a Western perspective that person may want to try Denny, from what I hear he is better, but really one should talk to a learned man of Islam if they really want to learn about the religion."
5,Transcendent,"I'm a new Bill Miller fan and have played this album over and over for the praise it calls forth from my spirit to my God. This is contemporary Christian rock at its best, and the message of unity, love and forgiveness transcends race, gender, age, and creed. The Native American instrumentation and vocalization on songs such as Holy Lands serves to broaden my experience of Christian worship, not just to include another culture but in a mystical way to connect me with my land and the generations who walked this land before me. Not mentioned on the list of tracks is Miller's remake of Bob Dylan's They, a wonderfully poignant reminder of the world's rejection of Christ's message and His messengers. Hear Our Prayer will bring an added dimension to your music collection that will absolutely take your breath away."
3,Excellent Bill Miller but lacking the assertion of his style,"Somehow he's gotten the idea that praise music is generally serene and sweet...and he does that exceptionally well, but I've found more personal inspiration from his assertive, bold, guitar-abusing stomps on other CD's. Having seen him live, I'd hoped his new ""Praises"" remake would capture that live intensity, with uncaged energy and the ""All along the watchtower"" cadenza. Instead, it's stripped down, delicate and tender. The passive timbre continues until the last song, a triumphant and bright song that my 2-year-old son asks for over and over by name every day (""Play turn me around!"")."
3,far from being the best bill miller's album ...,"I'm a great fan of bill Miller's music and I was a little bit disappointed by ""hear our prayer"" that is for me not as good as ""the red road"" for example. You can buy this cd if you've got all the others and you want to hear more from this extraordinary songwritter and guitarist. like allways, the songs are very well recorded even though there are too much instruments that remove a part of the magic that we expect in a bill miller's work...conclusion: if you want to buy your first miller's cd, you'd rather take ""The red road"", the ""live"" album or the most famous but nevertheless excellent ""ghostdance""."
2,very disappointing,"I've been a Bill Miller fan for awhile, from his days on World Cafe's Human Rights Tuesday in the early '90s. I saw him live and met him in Columbus in '94 or so, and our families are from the same part of WI. So it pains me to say how weak this CD is compared to his earlier materials. I highly recommend ""The Art of Survival"" and ""The Red Road"" over this effort. Back then he seemed to have something to say, and back then his strong guitar came through, rather than being placed in the back of an over-produced orchestration as we have here."
1,"WARNING: Product description is inconsistent, and you won't get what you expect","One of the other reviews hints at this problem (a one star review), but isn't very clear.The problem appears to be that the model number 630UA is actually a different model than is shown and described. I got a ""630UA"", but it didn't have an SD memory card slot as described and shown. Look closely at the picture, and you'll see the model number of what is shown.What is especially aggravating is that the product they shipped me is actually selling for about half the price of what I paid.Incidentally, the vendor, ANTonline, never returned the messages I left them through Amazon. Since it was a gift, I decided not to press for a return.Ron"
1,it don't have nothing memory card ports,I bought a system with reader cards port but thats a lie because the system don't have nothing at all.I don't know why you advice about a system with those characteristiques and send another totally different.
2,great at first but........,This unit seemed great when I first bought it. After about a month the USB and SD slots stopped working and support was minimal to non-existent from the manufacturer. The user manual was very small and lacked info. The buttons and volume knob don't always work well. I got the model with bluetooth but that was also a very poorly implemented feature. Reception also felt a tad weaker than my stock honda deck. I mostly use it for the aux in and mp3 cds which it plays well.
4,great watch,"A great buy...stylish and classy and very durable,perfect both for the office and for after work events,I will definitely be purchasing more KC watches in the future!!"
5,Structural Family Therapy Explained,"Sal Minuchin is known as the primary theoretician behind Structural Family Therapy. Structural Therapy is especially helpful with families that have inappropriate boundaries or that have dysfunctional marital dyads. This book explains the concepts behind the theory and helps the clinician understand how to put the therapy into practice. The book is well written and easy to read.Even if a therapist is primarily working with another counseling theory, this is an important book to have read and to have as part of the therapeutic repetoire."
5,Excellent! The only comprehensive book on this topic.,"John Riddle provides a comprehensive and compelling examination of contraception and abortion through history. An excellent reference, and the only source that shows the historical underpinnings of the contraceptive and abortive agents we use today.Fern Reiss (fernreiss@aol.com), author of ""The Infertility Diet: Get Pregnant and Prevent Miscarriage"""
5,Great Album,"Been looking for one song off this album for a while now and finally found it, love the whole album"
2,Check Out Something Different,"Ok i'd just like to say that he olsen twins are 2 of my idols but billbord dad was made when they were 11 or 12 and i dont think that its really up to top scratch!! it was thoroughly predictable and the girls had weak roles still as my idols i do say that id recomend it for kids under 10 as im sure that they'd love this. If your a teenager check out holiday in the sun, getting there and when in rome, these are done by the olsen's and they wont disapoint you."
4,The twins performed well :),"I have seen this movie three times, and I think that the twins did a very nice job in the roles they portrayed. I could see some similarities in their characters to the girls themselves. I thought it was cute and enjoyable, but I do happen to like their past movies a little more. But again, the twins are always a pleasure to watch. :)"
2,CORNY!,"This movie was okay, but really I mean really corny. Like anyone in their right mind would sneak out in the middle of the night and paint a billboard! HELLO!"
2,Not There Best,I did not really like this movie. I just found it anoying because sure someone is going to sneek out in the middle of the night to paint a billboard to tell the world there dad needs a wife or even a girl friend. Wake Up.
2,We don't recommend,"We (my twin sister and I,) watched this movie in a thought it would be cute. We couldn't find anything we would call cute. The plot was ok (it is after all a movie!), for a movie, but the action was kind of low. When the boy said that they are so perfect, they said they weren't. But in real life (AND the movie) in a way they are perfect - Money, Social, looks etc.. In this movie the story is unrealistic. (It is after all a movie!), would you go put a sign for your dad on a highway?? Who knows what kind of people answer that sign!! Little kids could enjoy. It is better for them. Enjoy!!!"
3,OKay .........I Guess......,No affense but this movie is a little strange! Mary-Kate and Ashley play twin sisters who mainly try to find their dad Max a date so he wont be so lonely and so he will be happy. Also they are both on a diving team and Ashley gets kicked off. Ashley has a huge crush on her diving coach and is not to happy about being kicked off.
1,Guess I'm Unlucky.,"I had to sit through this while babysitting 2 kids a couple of months ago. Crikey - what a bad film this is. Granted, it's aimed squarely at the pre-teen brigade, but surely even they deserve better than this. Funnily enough, the two central butter-wouldn't-melt Barbie characters are probably the least annoying aspect of the film. There's much too much debris here to analyze in depth, suffice to say that if you value your spare time as much as your sanity, don't go near it."
1,Extremely bad,"I have been a fan of Mary Kate and Ashly for a long time and always ignored the bad acting becuase they were so damn cute, but now that they have grown up my expectations are higher. This movie was a total rip off of Sleepless in Seatle, which was a great film. I don't get why all these little girls love the Olsen Twins so much but if you do then you will probably enjoy this movie."
1,This has gone too far,"I'm sorry, but I have been watching the Olsen Twins since I was 3 years old. Full House was my fave. show, and as I grew I loved watching Mary Kate and Ashley do all sorts of new things. I'll admit, It Takes Two was good, but anything after that just turned the twins into a couple of teenage brats. I was born in the same year, and at our age normal teenage girls do NOT act like that. There aren't the sporty, no clothes or boys girls and then the prissy, dressed up, no sports girls. Reality check, please? They were such good actresses as little girls, so what happened?"
3,HELLO! Wake up and get a life!,"It was cute but DUH! No one in their right minds would make a billboard, for heaven's sake, in order to find their father a wife. HELLO! But the acting was good and Cody was good."
4,the twins are great but its not my favorite movie they made.,"the twins are good but not as good as usual it was a little young for the mature,prettygirls to perform.all and all good movie.i have seen it about 8 time s its that good!!!"
1,Don't judge this book by its cover!,"This monumental flop begins with a six page dissertation during which the author describes various methods he's used to measure the size of his own perfectly average penis. Sadly, the rest of the collection is even less interesting. If Mickey Skee is, as the last section of the books would seem to suggest, a leading authority on gay porn, he should stick to reviewing the work of others. In short, dear readers, unless Mr. Skee has posed for the cover of this anthology and is willing to deliver it to your home in person, don't waste your money."
2,shocked by richburg,"Iam shocked and confused when I read on the internet about richburg's comment when he says he is American but not African American.Iam a young african who is very proud of my continent,though Iam greatly pained by the betrayals by our leaders.I haven't read the copy of ""out of america"" yet but I think richburg forgets that colonialists must be blamed for many atrocities on his Beautifull""ANCESTOR'S LAND "". The recent genocide in Rwanda can happen anywhere ,besides the genociders had support from some ""civilised nations"""
5,NOT FOR THE POLITICALLY CORRECT,"This is one of the best books I've ever read. It is well researched, well-documented, and well written. Frankly, Richburg exposes many ugly truths about Africa that need to be said. In a time when the media is rife with political correctness and an obvious liberal bias, Richburg's book is a breath of fresh air.The brainwashed PC masses may not be thrilled by this book, but they WILL learn from it. Richburg peels away at the many layers of ugliness that exist within African society: tribalism, racism towards blacks from themselves, and seething resentment (albeit understandable resentment) toward their imperialist masters that manifests itself through an unwillingness to see post-colonial realities. Richburg is brilliant. He takes you on a journey to hell and back again, and you enjoy the ride."
5,Africa is a painful reality,"Over the past 21 years, I have lived and worked in five African countries: Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Zaire and Nigeria. Perhaps, because I did not go as a tourist, I was not adopted into a tribe, given an African name, or found my relatives. Because of respect for the wonderful people I met and worked with, I do not wear kente cloth nor have I adopted ""Afrocentric customs."" There is nothing in Richburg's book that I could contradict. I too, experienced the horror, and hopelessnesss of that continent. I read ""Out of America"" in one sitting, and was left in tears for the many friends that I shall never see again. Like Richburg, my visits to Africa have left me with the unshakeable conviction that I am an American, not an African-American ... or hyphenated anything else"
4,Interesting,"This book is worth reading, but there are subtle things throughout it which indicate that Mr. Richburg, like many other authors, has an agenda that isn't totally obvious. I do not agree with his glorification of the United States, for one thing, but he does document some of the terrible things that happened (and still happen) in Africa, but about which the Western world seems quite ignorant. For those with the ability to measure all things against their own intelligence and knowledge, I recommend this book -- for those who simply believe whatever they are told by anyone with influence, I suggest that you steer clear for the time being."
2,Deeply disturbing,Richburg's account of his tour in Africa was extemely unsettling. Because he chose to focus his venemous penon the dictators and parasites raping and pillaging three countries in Africa he failed to see the majority of Africans that are fighting for a new day. He forgot to look beyond the his journalistic interests and see the real people of Africa.His prayer of thanks that his ancestor made it out of Africa and survived the demonic middle passage is pathetic and sad.Perhaps if his ancestors had not been kidnapped from Africa they could had helped to build up the continent. Instead hedisgraces their memory by tearing it down in this book.
5,An estremely powerful and moving book,"Out of America had me weeping, laughing but above all wondering what has gone wrong with us as Africans and people of African descent. It is certainly one of the most emotive books I've read in many years. Most of all it confirms my theory that Africans are indeed their own worst enemies, despite what we are led to think. As a member of the African Diaspora, and indeed the human race, I am appalled that we are capable of treating each other with such disrespect. It is for this reason that I think Out Of America should be recommended reading in schools around the world. I was dozing. But now I am awake. This is Mr.Richburg's gift to me and, I hope to others who have and will read his book."
1,Waste of print and paper!,"This was the absolute worst book I have ever read (and I am considered a bookworm by those who know me)! ---Not only is the author's position on being an african-american nauseating (not too dark, not from the worst of southern plantations, why can't I date a white woman, ancestors not typical blacks, etc, etc), but the book is also terribly written. The author jumps from one self pitying diatribe to another without telling a cohesive story.This book should be called ""An Oreo Cookie Confronts Africa but Not His Self-Image"". ---Again the only book I've been unable to complete (I'm not a masochist) and it is the worst I've ever picked up! Amazingly poor writing."
5,Absolutely brilliant!,"I am a white South African and have just read Keith Richburg's amazing book. I would like to thank Mr Richburg for his honesty and his courage. It is a pity to note that had this book been written by a white person it would have been dismissed out of hand as being racist. Keith Richburg's intelligence and integrity shows itself magnificently as he cuts through hypocritical, politically correct arguments and double-speak to attempt to answer some burning questions. Why are most of African countries such an abysimal mess, why are black Americans, after 400 years, still at the bottom of America's social totem pole and why do they still seem to be waiting for their ""twenty acres and a mule"". Thank you Keith Richburg, your book should be a school/college set work (or at least on Oprah's choice)."
5,"A must read for anyone ""puzzled"" by Africa","This book was an honest opinion of Africa - even daring to take on many of the politically correct ""no-no's"". Being originally from Africa myself, this book has answered numerous questions I have had about why Africa is where it is today."
5,Courageous Author,"I admire Keith Richburg for writing this book when I'm sure he knew the flack he'd catch for doing so. Reporters tend to see the story behind the story. so when you or I see a story in the news on genocide in Africa, we may think ""oh how terrible"". When a reporter like Mr. Richburg actually see the mutilated bodies laying out in the street or the bodies floating down the river as he stated in the book only then you can you actually realize the scope of what he saw and wrote about. As a black man I can see how he feels when he said that in a sense, it's a good thing that his ancestor was abducted and brought here which in turn ended up him being an American and not say, A Rwandan. As horrible as slavery in America was,could any of us truly imagine what it must have felt like for the Rwandans that survived the massacre there? This one book that every black American should read and read with an open mind. Bravo Mr Richburg for your courage"
4,Very Good,"This is the first book on Eichler, and it does an admirable job of getting the topic out there. The good part is that there are plenty of color photos and the book is very well desgined. The not-so-good part is that many of the homes pictured are remodeled and don't truly represent the original designs. The text is by 4 different authors and doesn't hold together well as a complete narrative. Still, if you are relatively new to Eichler this is a nice browsing book that will give you plenty of visual stimulation. For the definitive historical tome on the Eichler story, get ""Eichler: Modernism Rebuilds the American Dream"" by Adamson which is more complete and scholarly but not as visual and colorful. The two books actually make a good set and give you both sides of the story. In all, this is a very good book about beautiful and innovative homes by an important midcentury homebuilder and businessman."
5,Great Book on Eichler Homes,This is a great book for anyone interested in the Eichler Homes built in the late 1940's and 1950's. They were way ahead of their times. These were the first really modern homes. I was lucking enough to live in one in the 1950's in the Bay Area of California...Anyone interested in modern homes will enjoy this book..Beautiful pictures..
5,Great Magazine,"I used to subscribe to the Ziff Davis mags, PC World, PC Magazine... but I got really tired of those because they were turning in to an electronics magazine and not a PC mag. I want Magazines that has articles about PC's, their hardware and software, not cell phones and Home Theaters...This magazine does have an article or two about electronics but they are far and few in between. The articles they do have range from simple newbie articles to advanced reviews on Raid controllers.I will keep this magazine and have already dumped the Ziff Davis ones."
4,Magazine for computer builders and gamers,"Maximum PC is oriented largely to the high-end computer buff, although it contains a fair amount of material useful to the average computer user. Good computer magazines are few, so this is a useful addition to the field."
5,Up to date and entertaining.,"I've been a subscriber for over a year now, and consistently read each issue cover to cover the day it arrives in the mail. It's the must read journal for the PC enthusiast, even if you don't overclock or watercool your CPU. The reviews and feature articles are helpful, relevant, and entertaining. It isn't simply a vehicle for full page glossy ads, unlike many of the gamer magazines. Furthermore, the magazine staff has a real interest in listening to its readers. On top of that, it's a mere buck per issue! If only all my subscriptions were this valuable."
1,not what i expected,"When I subscribed to this magazine, the discription said it comes with the cd's. When I received my first copy, there was no cd included. I called the number provided and was then informed if I wanted the cd's, I would have to pay extra. Only order this if you don't want the cd's."
2,No CD/DVD with this subscription,I should have read the reviews before subscribing through Amazon. I've subscribed to this mag in the past and enjoyed the free programs it included every month on a disc. This subscription doesn't include the CD/DVD so it greatly lessens the value to me.
1,Don't buy a long subscription,"I previously had a multi-year subscription paid up to Yahoo Internet Life, which went out of print. My subscription was transferred to MaximumPC (no, I wasn't asked if this is what I wanted).I found MaximumPC to be a fairly decent magazine. More for gamers than for us regular folk.I recently read a letter to the editor about their CD, and wondered why I wasn't receiving one when my subscription to Yahoo Internet Life was paid up until Feb 04.I emailed them asking about this, and was told my subscription was for the magazine only. I was never given the choice of which I wanted - the magazine only or the magazine with the CD.They also told me that if I wanted the CD, I would have to send them another [dollar amount] on top of my paid supscription.I asked for a refund on my remaining 10-month subscription and received it today - all ... of it...."
5,The Best Computer Magazine......PERIOD!,"If you are really into building computers and keeping them up to date with the latest parts/mods, this is the magazine for you. If you buy your computer from corporations (Dell, Compaq, HP), and do not build your own machines. Then this magazine isn't 100% for you.Their reviews are highly informative and loaded with benchmarks. After reading 1-3 magazines you will have the best computer money can buy.ProsThe best ArticlesAwesome Reviews on software/hardwareAlways have the scoop on the latest computer partsConsThe Magazine is geared towards people who build computers"
3,For the ultra nerd,"Maximum PC is a PC magazine with an attitude. It's a rather slim magazine, with each issue averaging 110 pages, including ads. The emphasis is on opening up your PC's chassis and mudding around. There's also a monthly back page devoted to modding. As a PC user I have mixed feelings about the magazine. I'm not a diehard nerd (even though I can be a qualified technician as well as programmer), so I don't find the incessant coverage on upgrading and modding very interesting. The website is also a joke, not being able to offer a nice online complement to the print magazine. On the other hand, the content is not stale like with PC Mag and (gasp!) PC World, and some of the articles can be fun to read. The upshot is, this is worth subscribing to; it's just not the ""idea"" PC mag I expected to be."
3,Fine Print or NO print,"Wish it was written somewhere that you would not get the CD with the magazine. I knew the deal smelled to good to be true. Great magazine but no CD, and I'm stuck with this deal for 2 years."
3,Maximum PC,Make sure you make it clear that the listing says without Discs. I thought I would be getting discs with my magazines. I found out that was not the case.
4,Best PC Magainze - just wish they'd make a kindle-only edition,"I've been a reader for over 4 years, and their magazine is simply the best PC magazine available. The only downside is that they use a service like coverleaf for their digital version, which is so behind the times they offer no Android app, and they offer no digital-only subscriptions. I'm no 'tree-hugger' but I prefer to cut down on paper and clutter, and cut down on the stuff I end up throwing in the trash. I have an Android tablet on which I read a lot of things now, and I'd love to be able to subscribe to Maximum PC in a digital-only version, but it appears that is not something that is available. For a magazine that is cutting-edge, you'd think they'd have it available. The lack of a digital-only subscription is the only reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars. Content of the magazine and the website are both great, so they get HUGE points for that. If they had a digital only subscription I'd certainly give it 5-stars."
1,Where is my Maximum?,"Order this and a subscription to Computer Shopper on Dec 28 2001, got my Computer Shopper in Jan 2002, still have not seen a issue of Maximum PC as of end of Arril."
1,Not easy,Very bad delivery service. I have written twice about it and havent got the magazine. I paid a subscription but there is no guarantee as to when the monthly delivery is. Very bad choice I made with this publication.
2,A PURE SHOPPING CATALOG FOR GAMERS,"I'm disappointed with this magazine. As the title of this review suggests, this magazine is geared more towards gaming and gamers. In addition, the general pc articles were not very informative."
1,Not for IT enthusiests.,"This magazine is worthless for those looking to learn anything. If you are looking for paid advertising for i7 processors and the systems they are sold in, so you can play games, then you will enjoy it."
1,Maximum PC,Can't give a review on Maximum PC. Never received the magazine. Instead I was sent the men's magazine FHM. Please send my Maximum PC.
5,Objective and Current,"What a great magazine. I usually check Google news everyday to find out the latest in technology. But Maximum PC magazine delivers the best objective reviews on everything that I seem to miss. The ""how to install"" articles are very illustrative for even the newbie computer builder. I'm thinking about purchasing a new computer, and this magazine helps me determine what products to purchase and not to purchase. This magazine is directed towards a computer user that will need a fast computer to do video editing, gaming and other resource heavy requirement. If you want a serious review on the latest technology, this is your magazine. When I say objective, the last issue had a great article on why you may want to wait to purchase Windows Vista. Made me think twice on rushing out there to buy it."
4,Cutting edge,"I really like this magazine with its in depth insight into the PC and related software. If you like PC info, software, some hardware hacks and more you'll like this magizine."
3,No cd's?,Very dissapointed. I love this magazine and was very dissapointed to find out the cd's were not included with the subscription.
5,The best PC magazine,"In my opinion Maximum PC is the best PC magazine on the market. They are not sell-outs to their sponsors, unlike PC World and ZDNet in general. Maximum PC is not afraid to critique products that they do not like, so it's rare that products will get perfect 10's. I trust this magazine 100% with my computer hardware upgrades."
4,Hardware and more hardware,"This magazine is just like the title ""maximum"" They give you in extreme detail the good and bad of any type of computer hardware you could think of. IF you are a computer junkie or a typical ""overclocker"" this might be for you. The one probem that i found is that they tend to forget not everyone has $10,000 to build the ""ultimate pc"" with the latest greatest hardware. The writers pull no punches about saying exatcly what they fell about certain companies and somtimes you get the felling that thee own some stock in certain companies!But in all the hardware reviews (which is the main focus of the magazine) are very interesting and they give you more than enough details and benchmarks to help you choose your hardware."
1,Unreasonable Wait for subscription to start.,I subscribed in late May to MaximumPC and PCGamer. Early July I started getting PCGamer. Still nothing from MaximumPC. I called customer service and they said they had recieved my order June 2nd and to expect my first issue in late September. Thats nearly four months! That is an unreasonable wait relative to the industry standard and clearly outside the stated wait on the order form. I gave one star because the magazine is a good magazine. But at a $8.99 news stand price it is too expensive... so I am left with the choice of spending almost $35 to get the four months worth before my subscription starts (more than the subscription itself) or just missing out on those issue. Very poor customer service.
4,LIES,"Without saying anything in the title like discless copy, this is maximum pc, but the diskless version. If you want the disk, you will need to order from the maximum pc website. Not taking off any stars for that though. 4/5 mainly due to some of the erroneous advice given in the magazine, but a good magazine to read through nonetheless..."
4,MAXIMUM PC,The magazine came as order. I was pleased to see it had a software disk with it. It had good programs on it.
4,Excellent Reading,This magazine is very good for the novice to medium level computer user. Recommended for sure.
2,Not Techy enough,"I ordered this hoping to learn more about the latest gadgets, and I did learn some things but in over my head over all. I do not enjoy this reading at all."
4,"Good Mag, Good Perspective","I have been a subscriber for years, and consider the $10/year a no-brainer. Some issues are great, some are mediocre. But the info on real and unbiased tests of antivirus, or how-to's for bios settings alone make it worth the price of admission. Note that this subscription does not give you the CD's - that is just fine with me, I can get to the info via the website, or that big electronic thingee called the internet, and prefer not having a bunch of discs laying around. The magazine does tend to shift around a bit, and it looks like editors are chosen by dartboard, but the one consistent thing about the mag is its unabashed love for the PC platform, and unapologetic demand for the ""best"". Sometimes you will agree, sometimes it will tick you off (sorry AMD fanboys, right now Intel is simply a better CPU).Is this the only mag on PC stuff? nope! Is it the best? Maybe. But I can tell you that it is the magazine I most look forward to each month."
4,MaximumPC Mag Review,"The ""Maximum PC magazine"" [...] is a good source for well written and current reviews of tech products and computer related gear. ""Maximum PC"" contains a good mixture of graded reviews and staff editorials which keeps me interested and informed. The price of my 2 year subscription was cheap and I feel that I received a good deal. We will see however if there are any of the normal underhanded ""automatic-renewal"" subscription tactics in practice when my paid 2 years have elapsed. So far - so good. Keep up the good work Amazon. -Brent"
5,Best PC magazine around,"I've been reading this magazine for years. They are unbiased as they claim (note the editors themselves have no influence on the advertising put in the magazine). They manage to be lighthearted and admit to their own mistakes.The articles are informational and suit a wide range of interests. They do provide some great tutorials on how to install components, clean the PC, use software, etc from time to time. They review some PC games, but they are definitely not a gamer magazine.I appreciate the low price of the no-CD subscription, as I found myself never using the CD while paying a premium for them. I don't see a purpose in having the CD unless if you're too lazy to find the free/trial programs and download them yourself.I've subscribed to PCWorld and PCMagazine in the past, and MaximumPC is the best (IMO of course)."
4,Decent PC Magazine,"This magazine makes a good addition to my PC World Magazine. They seem more devoted to the high tech then the daily ""tweaking"" but they do a pretty good job of filling a magazine. I think any computer geek would get something out of each issue. This is probably not for the casual occasional PC user but more for the person that isn't afraid to ""open the box."
2,I only received one copy,I only received one copy of the mag so I couldn't really find out if it was good reading or not
3,just ok,This magazine is just ok. I ended up subscribing to pc world instead. They are more for the technician and not just the cusumer.
5,Great mag for the PC builder,"I've built a number of PCs, so the basics are of no use to me, but I like articles that don't use too much jargon or writing that is for compsci experts. This mag is a great fit for me. The articles are smart and cover topics that I care about.Highly recommended for the PC builder!"
1,you will never get 12 issues,First issue I got was June 2010 and last issue was Feb/2012 and says this is last one.I donot think many people track how many they get. If you count it they donot send 12 issue then you pay what you pay for 10 not 12. !!!!!
1,Plan to get your magazine delivered by the next ICE AGE!,The magazines ordered through amazon take an ETERNITY to be delivered. The estimated time for my delivery was April after I had placed the order in Feb. That's a long enough wait as it is---I ended up receiving it the the end of June! And when I called to complain...the customer service rep explained to me that it was technically within the estimated allowed time for delivery. so bottom line...if you have an urge to order a magazine that may take half a year or so to get to you...then this is the ONE FOR YOU-hands down. I plan on never ordering a single magazine through Amazon again. Definitely don't send a subscription to anyone as a birthday gift- it'll maybe make it in time for the FOLLOWING birthday year..so plan years in advance!
1,A long wait time,Just FYI - I just ordered this through Amazon and the estimated date is May 15 to June 20th that I will receive my first issue. If you want to wait 3-4 months until your first issue will arrive than be my guest and order it through Amazon. I would suggest going through the magazine website to order your magazine and it probably will be a shorter wait time. Gets one star since I was not warned this prior to ordering. It stated pre-ordering it would take 3-6 weeks not 3-4 months. Amazon is cool though but I am impatient and I want my stuff now!
2,only got 8 months,"It took several months to get the first issue and then the subscription tells me it would end after only 8 months. Supposed to get 12 months. Perhaps I had bad luck with this and this is not the end of the world, but buyer beware. If I had to do it again I would subscribe directly to the magazine."
3,No bias Magazine,-It keeps me up with the lasest PC technology.-Reviews are very unbiased-Too many Game technology articles
2,Too technical,"I read this magazine from cover to cover. It is probably a great magazine for very advanced, technical computer users or installers. I have been using computers at home for over 15 years, understand most of the installed programs and fix most of the problems that pop up. I find that this magazine is way too technical for the average user and that most articles are slanted to encourage buying, not using a computer. When I subscribed, I was hoping it would be as helpful as the old ""Smart Computing"" magazines were. There's not very many people I would give this to as a gift, or even give my old issues. I will not be renewing my subscription unless the writers come down out of their clouds and whip out some articles that will help the average home computer user."
5,Do You Know Hardware ?,"Regarding PC there is so much info on net but problem is reliability and from where to start because of new generation of pc ,games,LCD era.Things are much changed then days of simple pentium and ATI video card.I did research before i decided to go with Maximum Pc.Other magazines in same categories are full of advertisements and when you have so much advertisement then offcourse reviews become biased favoring sponsors.Maximum PC also have adds but thet are not many and mainly of PC Sellers rather then indiviual products.If you looking to keep yourself updated in ""timely manner"" with cool gadgets -Highly Recommended.Don`t go for CD version you can download all stuff as links are given within magazine and amazon will give you extra $5 off or some special offer .Look for it before subscribing ."
1,"Great Magazine, Very Bad Price!!!",This is the NON CD Issue and is offered at Amazon for 0 (Zero) discount.This is the normal price you would pay /yr times 2 yrs.
2,How many people are building their own computer ?,Most of this Mag is about building a computer . How many people build their own computer today. The buys today are so cheap .Most people could not even start to build their own computer. How about articles on how USE a computer???
3,"Good Magazine, poor subscription update","I tought I was renewing my MaximumPC subscription (I have subscribed for 6 or 7 years) but I ended up getting 2 subscriptions, with this new one overlapping my previous one. Not sure I'd try this with Amazon again since it should have simply extended my original subscription, but did not, so there were no savings."
5,Excellent Computer Magazine,"When PC Magazine ceased publication of their paper magazine, I began to look for a replacement, and I found it in this magazine. This magazine covers the latest information in the field of computers and related technology. Some of my favorite sections are:White paper - In this section a technology is explained. For example, in the last issue I read how AES secures your data.Doctor - This section answers user questions. I always seem to find some very useful information here.Features - Presents feature articles on timely subjects.News - Presents the latest news in the field.Reviews - Here the magazine reviews various tech gear and rates them with a rating system from one to ten.Overall, I have been pleased with the coverage of the computer field that this magazine presents."
4,"Good Mag, but before you order you should know...","First off eveyone is complaining of waiting for magazine to show up lately. Its was a long wait for me too. thats why it says 6-10 weeks people. dont expect it sooner, duh. anyways, the magazine is good. it doesnt advertise some major brands like gateway, but its a good reference magazine, and you can learn some stuff from it every month, but theres only been one article in maybe 7 magazines i have that deals with linux, and ive never seen a mac article. overall its cheap and that makes it a good deal, the only magazine i currently like more costs 30 dollars so Maximum PC is a good deal."
4,Great Magazine,"I have been a subscriber since they were called Boot. Very informative and thorough, but accessible writing, as well as being pretty funny. I highly recommend this magazine and the only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the CD that comes with it is usually pretty lame. I would stick to the non CD subscription for a better value."
4,Awaiting Delivery,"I know it takes eight weeks and maybe longer but I do appreciate the information that I've gained from store bought ""Maximum PC"" magazines. I don't build computers but when I do order one, it is nice to be familier with the workings and attributes of the new computer.Yes... you can find much information on-line and generally faster than the amount of time it takes for the magazine to reach your mailbox, however, is great to kick back away from the computer in your favorite chair and 'read' about it :)A very good magazine... but 'adult' language used at times does not appear to me as professional use of the english language.Thus the 4 rather than five stars."
1,Subscription without CD ????,"One of the main attractions of the magazine ""Maximum PC"" is the bundled CD with demos programs, freeware and utilities. I just received the first issue of my suscription and I notice with great disappointment that comes without the disc. In case the subscription offered by Amazon not include the disc, Amazon must have clearly informed. I feel cheated for a year and then will cancel the subscription.Mario Zanocchi"
2,Boy have they changed,"I got this as a Deal of the Day, without having opened an issue in a decade or more. This is the same mag in name only.This has become a mag for gamers through and through. I would suggest going and taking a look in a store before buying this online. I would cancel it if I had a chance of getting my money back.Update: The issues have become slightly more inclusive lately, with an article or two per issue not intended for the gaming community (i.e. utility programs) but most of the issues are still geared towards gaming hardware or how announced but not released tech might affect gaming 'rigs'."
5,Sesame Street Really Rocks!,"I finally have some of the greatest sesame street songs on DVD! I really like the part in ""The Word Is No"" where Gina sings the bridge part of the song herself. She has been one of my very favorite Sesame Street humans from the beginning. I recommend this to anyone who love to rock with Sesame Street!"
1,Product hasn't arrived yet...,"I'm still waiting for this product, it hasn't arrived; it was supposed that on January 13, 2011 - February 14, 2011 but it's now June and I don't think it will... I rated it with one star because the site didn't allow it to leave it in blank...but for me, they don't deserve any..."
3,"Pretty Good, with a few exceptions...","My daughter watches this one all the way through for the most part. It centers around Jackman Wolf playing requests on the radio. My only wish is that a more charismatic character was the main breach between songs. The wolf scares my daughter a little bit when he howls in the beginning. She would prefer Elmo (although he can't be in everything!), Ernie, or even Grover. Other than that, the songs are entertaining, and the story flows well. It holds your interest pretty well."
3,This is a good CD,"The first ""grown up"" record I ever had a s a kid was a Glen Campbell record. I can't remember which one it was. I heard ""Wichita Lineman"" on the radio one day and decided I should have a Glen Campbell CD to listen to in my car. This one has only great songs on it. The only thing that disappointed me was that the songs were not digitally remastered. The songs are great but the quality of the sound is pretty bad."
3,Sound is fine.,"Sound quality is fine for recordings of this vintage, I haven't heard any better so far.Did Glen Campbell even have any other hits besides the 7 on this compilation?"
4,Good Compilation,"Great CD, has some really talented people. Looking to hear something more from this label."
2,What a dog.,"Pretty good price on this camera. You know why? It's so you can spend the money you saved on BATTERIES. I should know, we sell these at the store where I work. Probably 50% of the S404's we sell are returned because people can't use them for a normal period of time without the batteries going dead.I suggest you look at the Nikon 4300 or Canon S40/S45. You'll thank me later."
1,buy something else,"This camera is a waste of money. It may have been good when it came out buy in 2011 those that are left on the market aren't worth it in the 4MP class. I've had two of them and they both malfunctioned.While they were working I found they were slow, clunky, average image quality, and battery eaters.. If you want a 4MP camera look at the Olympus Stylus 410D and the Konica Minolta DiMage Z2. Both of those cameras are far superior to this one."
2,Nice - But Not nice enough,"This is (was) my second digital camera. After much research for an upcoming trip I decided on the Minolta. Long story short... I took it back 3 days later. Here's why: Battery Drainer! Even with 1800 Mah NiMH batteries, it does not last long. Although it has nice features and takes nice photos, it isn't worth much to me if you have to carry around a boat-load of batteries...especially on a vacation. Another thing to remember, 2,272 x 1,704 pixel images is large, but will never be as large as 35mm film. I am getting a very nice compact film camera, having the film scanned to CD, and calling it a digital camera for a fourth of the price."
5,What a great didgital camera!,"The Minolta D404 takes great didgital pictures from 4"" to infinity. Just point and shoot with the AF/AE. The resolution is superb. Downloading using the USB with XP is easy and takes only a few minutes. The camera is lightweight, holds nice and uses standard 4AA bateries. Use rechargeables. The controls are easy to learn and use and are well laid out. Delete old pictures using Windows explorer or imaging software. The camera also has audio and motion features."
4,"4 MP? As a practical matter, a questionable claim.","At highest resolution/size my S404 takes over 30 seconds to save the image, which is an 11 meg .TIFF file. I would venture that for most of us, the delay is a major or fatal issue, and for everyone I know the size of the file prevents any normal shooting at the top end. Accordingly, four megapixels is more theoretical than real, and perhaps this camera should be compared (especially as to price) with 3 MP boxes. As much noted, the flash does not have quite the range as claimed by the specs. It is a fine instrument, that having been said. I think it deserves a 3.75."
5,Good Camera,"After using a digital camera at work for a couple of years and searching for my own I landed on the Dimage S404. It is a lot of camera for the price. Easy to use, easy downloading of the images to a computer. It doesn't use a proprietery battery so that is handy. I would suggest the purchase of rechargeble batteries if you go with this camera however.This is really all the camera I need. If it has a downside... I don't believe the macro works as well as other cameras I have used. It doesn't have quite the detail of several Sonys I had used. That said the macro still works well.Other than that I don't think you can do better dollar for dollar."
1,Can't bear to listen to it again,"I've listened to this recording twice but I probably won't listen to it again, for the singing gives me little pleasure. Russell Watson's voice and technique are both unsatisfactory and his performances are hard on the ears.I will only give this recording a single star."
1,Inadequate voice for the music,"Russell Watson does not have an adequate voice for much of the music that he attempts in this album. As a result, his performances are farcical, mere parodies of real interpretations of the music.An album to be avoided."
1,Over-praised,"This recording is definitely the subject of hype. Having heard this recording in its entirety, I can categorically say that the singing here is bad. Very bad, actually. The singer cheats with the music and does not offer anything special. One of the worst, if not actually the worst, discs that I've ever heard."
1,Ludicrous singing,The singer I heard on this recording is simply ludicrous!It's a parady of classical vocalism and the operatic style. Russell Watson can't even sing one phrase in a proper and musical manner. His voice is coarse and his mannerisms often most annoying. He doesn't even have the little talent to make the music come alive.A most unsatisfactory release!
1,From bad to worse,"In the ordinary course of things, a singer, especially as young singer, would improve with each recording that s/he makes.Unfortunately, this does not seem to happen with Russell Watson, whose 2nd album marks a dramatic deterioration from the first.Maybe Watson is so blinded by the commercial success of his 1st album that he just want to cash on with another release without caring to hone his vocal skills.But even that, it is still disappointing to find Watson's singing to have declined like that. His first album, The Voice, is bad enough. This 2nd album, Encore, manages to be much worse, which is quite a feat!The singing, interpretation and even the orchestral playing and engineering are all worse than the 1st album. Quite terrible in fact.I would never recommend such substandard stuff to people."
1,Poor performances of great music,"The music here is good and interesting. Unfortunately, everything is ruined by the amateurish singing of Russell Watson, who literally croads his way through the recording. Not only has Watson failed to do any justice to the music, he has, in my view, succeeded in making such sublime music sound mundane and unpleasant.Fortunately, there're many better singers around these days. Compared to them, Watson's recordings are uncompetitive."
1,Uninteresting CD,This CD is so uninteresting! I nearly fell asleep when listening to it! The reason? The choice of music is uninspiring. The singing is haphazard and uncommunicative. There's just no life in the performances! A bore.
1,A singer without much voice,"It is strange to hear a singer who hasn't got much of a voice singing the kind of music on this recording. Needless to say, he is unable to perform the taxing music competently. Indeed, his performances are almost a farce. One star only."
1,Hilarious singing,"Well, perhaps there just aren't standards anymore these days, for I'm utterly astonished that people can claim that Russell Watson is an 'opera singer'. Well, just ask Mr Watson to sing in unamplified opera on the stage and see how he cope. I'm sure his smallish voice, limited range and non-existent technique will lead him to be hissed off the stage within the first 5 minutes.What a great pretender he is!"
1,Disgraceful release,"Shame to the record company who releases such a substandard recording. It's so very disgraceful! Russell Watson at present just doesn't have the voice, technique and interpretative talent to perform such kind of music. No wonder that his performances here are so bad.I won't recommend it to others."
1,Much worse than the 1st album,"I'm gravely disappointed with this cd. It is much worse than the singer's first album. Here, both the voice and the singing has declined in standard. I'll give it one star."
1,Substandard and joyless singing,The singing on this cd is substandard and the interpretations are joyless. It is nothing more than a bland recording by an uncommunicative and technically deficient singer.
1,What an encore!,What an encore this is! The singing on this cd is so bad that one wonder why Mr Watson and his record company are so keen to release a 2nd album. Neither the voice nor the interpretations give any pleasure.
1,Exceedingly bad in quality,"This cd is of exceedingly bad quality. Russell Watson is unable to singing any music properly, and as a result, his performances on this terrible cd leaves a lot to be desired whether in terms of technique or interpretation. In fact, this cd gives me no pleasure at all. I'll be disposing of it shortly."
1,Worst of the lot,"I know nothing about classical music, and therefore cannot comment on those opera arias in this disc.However, I've listened to a lot of cross-over, and I must say that this cd is probably the worst of the lot.As some others have pointed out, Russell Watson's singing is not competitive enough when faced with the challenges of Groban, Bocelli, Safina, Frangoulis and Church etc.Moreover, Watson doesn't sing with a heart and we listeners do know whether or not a singer has put in his heart when making the recording.Thumbs down to this bad release."
1,HORRID!,"As an operalover I'm disgusted by this ""crossover""... I heard Watson BUTCHERING ""Nessun Dorma"" on the American TV Show ""The Nanny""... This CD is even worse! He has NO BUSINESS singing opera! Simply disgusting!"
1,A musical embarrassment,"This cd must be quite an embarrassment to both the singer and his fans, for the singing is so bad that there're a few moments in each of the tracks that Russell Watson makes a musical fool of himself. Needless to say, this kind of recording won't appeal to any serious music lover."
1,Terrible singing,The singing on this album is just terrible! Russell Watson can't even sustain a phrase to its proper length. How can one expect him to perform entire arias or music of any great difficulty?A total disappointment.
1,"Much worse than ""The Voice""","I'm thoroughly disappointed with this album, which is much worse than the singer's first album, ""The Voice"".There has been a marked deterioration of the vocal quality of Russell Watson. Besides, the singers seems to have given much less attention to expression, making the performances on this new album all the lot less communicative.Watson's future looks very much in doubt unless he brushes up his singing and give us something better in quality."
1,Can only bear it once,"I bought this cd recently, but I could only bear to listen to it once. It is a grave disappointment for the singing on this cd is extremely bad.Russell Watson clearly is not up to the task in a project of this type. His voice, unpleasant in timbre and restricted in both size and range, just can't cope with much of the music.His generalised interpretations also betrays his lack of experience in vocal performance as well as his ignorance of different music styles.Such under-nourished performances aren't helped by an overly vibrant contribution from the orchestra.Frankly, I derive so little enjoyment from this cd that I haven't the slightest urge to listen to it again. The money that I spent on it is considered wasted."
1,A bad recording,"What a bad recording this is!The singer on this recording cannot sing. He bawls his way through the music, glossing over all those small details which make those pieces so interesting. As a result, Russell Watson is here performing only simplified versions of the music. That he performs them so badly even so is clear indication of his many failings and inadequacies.One star only."
5,He's in a class by himself!,"I have been a fan of Russell Watson ever since I saw his concerts in England, while visiting. He is the most underrated singer in the US and Canada and needs the publicity given to the well-known cross-over artists. Although I feel he is so different than the cross-over singers and belongs in a class by himself. I have all of his CDs and think he is one of the world's most talented singers and wait till you see his charm and wit.Not only do Watson's CDs give us a beautiful range of his magnificent, clear, and powerful tenor voice but his interpretation of each song is different and wonderful. This CD is sure to please anyone with an appreciation for pure talent. Heck, just get it because there is nobody that can sing like Russell Watson- he has a voice to both make your knees melt and lift you up with inspiration!"
5,I am partial to Watson,"Yes, I am partial to Watson! The tracks on this CD are bellissimo!Even if you've never heard Watson sing before, this album or the Voice would be the best place to begin! And if you have heard him, don't delay in getting this CD.....you'll listen repeatedly. Russell Watson can be powerful, romantic, vibrant, and exhuberant, and as usual, his choice of song favorites, excellent!"
5,Great performances!,"There's so much pleasure to gain buy listening to this album. The singing here is unbelievably beautiful on the ear. The performances are exciting and stylistically varied. Even the voice itself seems to have improved markedly over the past 2 years. While some people may not like Russell's style of singing, it is clear that Russell Watson is already capturing a world-wide audience."
5,Love this CD!,"I can see how Russell Watson and his record company can market this album and its predecessor by virtue of the singer's magnificent voice, for it is obvious from the recordings that Watson is quite a sensational singer.Not only is his voice pleasant, his vocal technique is amazing. Every track on this album is appealing. At times, the singing is such that it will overcome you with pleasure and joy from a musical point of view.I love this CD."
1,Impossibly bad,"I would apologise to fans of Russell Watson for what I'm going to write, but I do find the album to be really bad after listening to it for a few times.The voice of Russell Watson is pleasant enough. Yet, he has failed to put it to better use. Instead, he tries to attempt something that his voice cannot cope, whether in terms of range, amplitude or style. The result is bad singing that is painful to hear.Also, Russell Watson seems not to have studied the music at much depth for his interpretation is superficial, I even find them emotionall glacial.That some people may like this album may be the reason of the music's intrinsic worth. However, as heard from this album, Russell Watson is far from their ideal interpretater."
1,Uncomfortable listening experience,"Why does Russell Watson have to end almost every phrase in such a way as if he were being stragulated by somebody? This, and many other vocal defects, clearly shows that Russell Watson does not have a good singing technique. It is his shortness of breath and roughness of singing that cause such embarrassing technical glitches. Maybe some people may enjoy this kind of singing, but in my view, this album makes very uncomfortable listening. Certainly can't be recommended to any one who enjoys good singing."
1,"All hype, no skill","I've read many good words about Rusell Watson. No harm to try out his cds, I think. Bought this cd, listened twice, and found that there's nothing but hype - the singing is bad, obviously not the work of a skilled singer.Never mind. I can afford the money, but it's disappointing. I think I'll be suspicious of any singer that relies so much on the publicity machinery in the future. After all, if you think about it, if the singer is good, why would he need the help of it?"
5,Exquisite,"Take time to really listen to this one and you will find yourself engrossed with every track and amazed at this talented singer. I've bought countless copies as gifts - about as good as it gets. The first track, ""Va, pensiero"" reveals Watson's multi-faceted voice, but but EVERY other song on the CD is as good or better. Listen to ""Is Nothing Sacred"" and ""Che gelda manina"" and you will be amazed that this is only one singer and not several . ""You Are So Beautiful"" can almost always make you shed a tear or too. Absolutely exquisite."
5,Watson owns every song he sings,"Who would ever have thought that this classical singer, Watson, could sing ""You Are So Beautiful"" and sing it so tenderly and with such supreme conviction? What a beautiful listening experience this is for the listener.Encore has produced some of Watson's most understated music, but also some of his best. ""E lucevan le stelle"" has got to be the crowning moment here. This classical aria has been sung hundreds of times by other artists, but no one ever sang it like Watson --- this is the definitive rendition. You can listen to it a thousand times and still marvel at his phrasing and unique stress on certain words.""Is Nothing Sacred"" is another simple, yet magical masterpiece. Notice how Watson sings with such feeling unlike many rock stars and you can understand all of the lyrics. He owns every song on this record. A fabulous singer if there ever was one."
5,This is a must-have CD,"As other reviewers have said, this album is a special treat because it has the perfect mix of classical and pop songs. Watson absolutely soars in ""O Sole Mio"" and is just terrific in the unusual arrangement of ""Bohemian Rhapsody"".This CD also contains 3 of Watson's Finest pop songs; they are ""You Are So Beautiful"", ""Is Nothing Sacred"", and ""Where My Heart Will Take Me"". Watson is in fine voice and this CD would be a must for any fan even if it contained only one of these pop ballad/songs."
5,Fantastic talent and voice,"I bought the album when it first came out, awhile back, and to this day still listen to it daily!!! I don't do that with any of my other CDs, and I've got an extensive collection. I remember when I was first introduced to Watson by accident when he appeared on a Good Morning America show and I can still see the imagery that Watson projected on the set and me listening to this fantastic talent and voice.For those who have not listened to this Watson album before - do so - you'll be playing it more than once - enjoy!"
1,A complete disappointment,"When one have read so many positive words about an album, one naturally will have some expectations. Unfortunately, this album proves to be a complete disappointment, which may perhaps suggest that many of those positive reviews here are in fact written by fans of the singer instead of people who really know how to appreciate music.As I said, this album is totally disappointing. The singing is sorely substandard in terms of technique. The performances are also as bland as can be, for the singer does not appear to have any emotional identification with any of the songs here. The singer also seems to have little sense of different musical styles and he merely tackles each and every of the songs in the same boring manner.I'd have given this album zero stars if it had been possible."
1,Don't like it at all,"As this cd is given to me by a friend, it seems rather ungrateful to write about it in a negative way.However, I have to be honest, because I found this cd to be totally unenjoyable. The choice of music is uninteresting and the performances by Russell Watson leaves me absolutely cold.I'm sorry for my friend to have wasted her money buying me this cd, which I won't get even if it's to be sold for one dollar...."
1,Can't compare to Bocelli and Frangoulis,"Despite the obvious fact that a couple of fans of Russell Watson keeps heaping over-sized praise on Russell Watson by posting the same few posts through different alias here, I think it is already quite evident that Russell Watson's many shortcomings as a singer have been noted by most.Frankly, I don't think Watson is in the league of, say, Bocelli and Frangoulis, both of whom have much better voices and technique. They're real artists whereas Watson, as seen from his embarrassing performances on this album, is merely a farce.Can anyone really think Watson's singing is ""beautiful"" or ""excellent""? Oh, come on!"
5,I've worn this CD out!,"Like so many other reviewers have said, I have listened to this album so much now I think the CD will wear out so I'll have to buy another one! I've never heard of so many people playing a CD as much as this one. It is excellent.Anyone who doubts Russell Watson's ability as a classical singer really doesn't know what they are talking about. As an A-Level music student I have listened to many singers and heard a multitude of different music including opera. I have never heard a voice as unique as Watson's.A must have for anyone who is a music lover. Encore will make the hair on your neck stand up. It is that good."
5,Can't stop listening to Encore,"I don't normally listen to voices like Watson's, but a friend had this playing in her car, and I was curious about who this man was. I borrowed her cd and it really grew on me so I bought it. I've had it for a month now and can't stop listening to it! This is a great album for anyone who needs a soothing break from all the stuff on the radio these days. I'm really pleased with my purchase, and definitely recommend this to my friends."
1,Mere shouting,"I've never heard a singer who shouts that much on a recording. Clearly, Russell Watson has little vocal finesse, and he has to resort to shouting, and even screaming, in order to reach the notes.Another big reservation is in the recording. There is too much reverberation, making the sound rather artificial. Maybe there's indeed quite a lot of artificiality in this recording as Russell Watson is plainly unable to sing many of the songs here, such impression being reinforced by his live appearances where he croaks, struggles and bulldoze his way through the music."
1,L:eaves me cold,"This kind of singing can only leave me cold.Russell Watson has neither a good voice nor a secure singing technique. His singing is a travesty in most cases. He cannot deliver the notes, and he cannot communicate the emotion behind the music.What a lifeless album!"
1,Far from great encore,"I'd compare Russell Watson's producing this ""encore"" album to a performer who has given a bad performance but insists on given an encore despite the boos that he receives.In his first album, Russell Watson has already revealed to us his many inadequacies. Unfortunately, not only has he not realise this (which by itself already renders him not a genuine musician), his voice, singing skills and mannerism suffer a decline in this album, making it an even worse document of bad singing that the first one.Extremely disappointing."
1,Boring singer with little versatility,"What I heard on this album is the work of a boring singer with little versatility. Not only has Russell Watson failed to manage the notes, he is unable to deliver the songs in accordance with the distinctive style of each piece of music. In my view, this certainly reflects the lack of versatility of Russell Watson. The mere fact that he chooses to sing different types of music (not to say that he sings them badly) is not a mark of versatility. Only those who can sing well in different kinds of music truly deserves such a descrption.In my view, Russell Watson has failed miserably in a project that he cannot cope with."
5,A most beautiful album,"This is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful albums ever made.Watson is at his best, singing powerfully or barely above a whisper in the romantic songs while the orchestral background music compliments him wonderfully.This album is a must buy."
5,You'll listen to Watson all day long,"The reviewers are right, you will never get tired listening t this CD. This is Russell Watson in top flight, every track is great. Included on this Cd is a selection from the full Watson repertoire, opera, operetta, musical comedy and popular songs of the day all sung to perfection as only Russell could sing them. For anyone who is a Watson fan or for anyone who has only just heard of the Russell Watson name, this is the Cd for you, but beware once you listen to this you won't get anything done."
5,CD has everything,"Excellent CD, excellent voice. This CD has everything...classical, pop, pop-rock, a talented singer singing in ""many"" different voices. What more can you ask for?Buy it!"
5,Thoroughly enjoyable CD,"This is a thoroughly enjoyable album. I enjoy songs of his like Nothing Sacred and Va, pensiero. Yes this is a different kind of album but it belongs in everyone's collection.I still prefer his Voice album and from reading the reviews on Reprise, that may be Watson's best CD yet. At any rate, I encourage you to buy Encore. It's very good"
5,Versatility in his voice is wonderful,Russell Watson is an amazingly talented young man with a beautiful and marvelous voice. He has a stunning depth to his voice that shows off wonderful warmth and color.There are individuals who are upset by his singing both classical and modern pieces but I think the versatility in his voice is wonderful. This is truly a lovely CD....an excellent buy!
5,More than satisfactory recording,"This recording is more than satisfactory in many ways. The singing is breathtakingly beautiful and the orchestration backs up his voice beautifully. As a result, the CD is a production masterpiece. A thrilling and exciting CD."
5,Spectacular CD - 5 Stars,"This is fabulous! The singing is technically so superb, and the interpretation so charming that this must be, by far, the best cross-over album ever released. 5 marks can be awarded to this spectacular CD."
1,Inferior performances,"I found the performances in this album to be inferior than most recordings of the same music that I can find in record stores.Russell Watson is plainly inadequate as a singer. His voice, vocal technical and interpretative abilities are all called into question. I won't waste my time commenting on the numerous defects of the performances here. I would only say that it's plainly bad with little redeeming qualities.I will give this album one star."
1,Not good enough,"Having listened to Bocelli, I find Russell Watson's singing to be not good enough. Bocelli is the superior artist in every respect over the same field. I hope Russell Watson can learn something from Bocelli first before exposing his own severe limitations through such ill-considered recording projects."
1,Unacceptable singing,Can't imagine there being a worst-sung vocal album than this one. Russell Watson's vocalism is quite appalling and neither his voice nor his sorely substandard singing skills are suitable for a commercial recording. He is also no match for other cross-over artists like Bocelli and Frangoulis in terms of style and charm.This is a far from respectable release that should be avoided.
1,From bad to worse,"Russell Watson's first album is already quite a bad recording. However, his 2nd album is much worse, for both his voice and his singing have deteriorated markedly. The choice of music is also less good that the first album. I can only give it one star."
1,Bad singing,"What bad singing! I don't think I've ever heard any singing that is as bad as what I hear on this wretched recording by Russell Watson, a singer who has little voice and talent. It is outragoues for such a kind recording to be sold at full price."
1,A shameful recording,"What a shameful recording this is! The performances are of such a low standard that the tracks here shouldn't have been released. In fact, Russell Watson shouldn't be singing publicly, except in his bathroom. A complete waste of money. I'll be dispensing with my copy shortly."
1,Worst possible singing ever committed on disc,"Other than the ludricrous recordings of Florence Foster Jenkins, this album must have captured the worst possible singing on disc. None of the tracks give pleasure. The singing is totally bad and the interpretations are contrived and absurd. I really can't stand it."
1,Bad encore,"It's ironice that Russell Watson and Decca have chosen such a name for this album, for Russell Watson doesn't deserve to be given a chance to do an encore album, given the very low standards achieved in his first one, ""The Voice"".Unfortunately, Watson's singing has gone from bad to worse here, and none of the track is listenable. Are there still standards in record making these days?"
1,My kids don't like it,"I bought this recording for my kids. Unfortunately, they don't like it. They even say that such a kind of singing cannot be tolerated in their high school choir! Well, I initially thought that children would warm to the ""hip"" image of Russell Watson and would take less notice of his performance standard. It seems that I was wrong - the singing here seems to be so bad that anyone who has any ear for good music will notice. I must say that I've may a wrong investment."
1,Watson is too ambitious,"With a voice of modest proportions and an elementary singing technique, Russell Watson is definitely too ambitious in tackling such a demanding program. It's small wonder that this album is almost a disaster in artistic terms. Most of the tracks aren't even listenable. I don't think this kind of album is the right sort of recording vehicle for this singer."
1,An album of poor quality,"This is plainly an album of poor quality. Not only has Russell Watson a course and untrained voice, his performances are non-stylish, unsubtle and unidiomatic. The orchestral support is mediocre and the recording acoustics is far too overblown. I don't think this is a good recording at all."
1,Bad singing,"I can hear only bad singing on this album. It gives me no pleasure at all. In fact, I'm irritated by the abrasive sounds made by the singer. Not recommended."
1,A vocal farce,"I have listened to this recording and I consider it to be nothing more than a vocal farce. It is sad to learn that there're no longer any standards in the making of vocal recordings. In the past, such poor singing as one can hear on this album will never pass for public release. Shame to the recording company in allowing such substandard stuff to reach the record store."
1,What a voice!,"What a voice Russell Watson has!It is a voice that is narrow in range, limited in vocal colors, inflexible and inexpressive. No wonder that the performances are are so bad. In fact, much of the singing here represents a gross distortion of the music as written.What a terrible voice this singer has!"
1,Not good at all,"I am disappointed by what I hear on this cd. The performances are no good at all. The raspy voice of the singing, and his appalling technique render each track a vocal farce. There're many things which should have been corrected and improved on before the cd is released. This cd is too flawed to be recommended."
1,So this is Russell Watson,"After all the hype, the only thing I hear on this cd is Russell Watson's hoarse and unmusical performances. How come he has been marketed as the people's tenor? I don't think he would even make it into a decent school choir."
1,From bad to worse,"Russell Watson's singing has travelled from bad to worse. At least his first album has some interesting music. Here, nothing is good. The performances are often very bad. I regret buying this recording."
1,Unsatisfactory performances,"Russell Watson doesn't have the voice, range, and style for such a kind of music. As a result, he stumbles and falls along the way. Such amateurish singing is pretty shameful when released on a recording sold at full price."
1,Demonstration on how not to sing,"The singing on this cd is so bad that the one use I can think of for this cd is to demonstrate to people how not to sing!Russell Watson's narrow and weak voice fail to bring the music to life. On the contrary, it makes painful listening as Watson struggles so often with notes that he can't reach comfortably.I will only give this cd half a star."
1,Not enjoyable at all,"Russell Watson's precarious singing does no justice to the music. To tell the truth, Watson simply does not have the voice and technique to perform such a kind of demanding music. He merely embarrasses himself with each attempt. A perverse recording which can bring more laughter of ridicule than any genuine sense of enjoyment on the part of the listener."
1,A bad voice,"What a bad voice on parade! I am afraid that Mr Watson hasn't even mastered the basics of singing. His voice, of limited range and volume, sounds ill at ease when singing, and he comes to grief in the more strenuous passages. Horrid performances!"
5,Great Voice! Great Singer! Great Talent!,"Russell Watson reminds me of Josh Groban in that he prefers to do ballads, showtunes, and challenging vocals such as opera. His voice can sing classics like ""O Sole Mio"" and ""Volare"" with that high pitch. He can sing ""You are So Beautiful"" and ""Somewhere"" from the West Side Story with the best of them. He has a terrific voice and sings these songs as well as Puccini's operatic melodies with style, substance, and depth to touch the human soul. His range and taste is worth the purchase of this compact disc. Think of singers like Russell Watson and Josh Groban who prefer to sing songs of depth than quick hits. His song interpretations and range vary from serious to operatic and a light-heartedness with some popular classics like ""You are So Beautiful."" It's a nice compilation and I hope to hear more from this singer."
5,10 Stars,"Russell Watson's first album was sensational. However, listeners would naturally expect a decline in performatnce on his 2nd album. Surprise, surprise, Watson has exceeded his brilliant performance with an outstanding one on this CD. In fact, his singing here is spectacular compared to his debut album, which is both amazing and exciting. If the debut album is worth 5 stars, this new should get 10."
5,From country music to Russell Watson,"I am definitely a country girl at heart and not a fan of classical music. BUT I was given this CD as a gift at an office Christmas party and it has become my favorite. I'm not an expert in classical music but I know what I like. I like Russell Watson. To me, he has the most incredible voice that reaches deep into my soul and brings out emotions that I didn't know were there. Listening to country music all my life, I can't believe how this singer has temporarily replaced Garth Brooks and Toby Keith!! Russell Watson is the people's tenor. I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to FEEL music."
5,Russell Watson has become my favorite singer,"I just saw the Good Morning America show on TV and have been enchanted by Russell Watson's voice. He puts me on cloud 9 with his range and his music. I have been chasing after his CD's like mad and finally was able to find Encore and am ordering the ""Voice"" and the New Zealand Encore too. My favorite song on the US Encore is ""Mattinata"" and, of course, Va, pensiero, his GMA number. Russell Watson is fast becoming, actually, has become by favorite artist."
5,Watson is Breathtaking!,"Being English, I have been a lifetime fan of Russell Watson. To hear his magical and perfect voice on CD is breathtaking. I wish he would record more today. His voice and presence are so romantic, it seems that he sings personally to everyone in the audience. One of my favourite singers!"
5,Highly recommended,"If you love Russell's music (his incredible voice), this is the album you have been waiting for. I have many CDs of classical and cross-over singers but I never owned a such an exceptional collection covering such a broad range of music than this CD. Once you let Russell's music into your heart and soul, you will look at your surroundings in a different way. This is a great album and I highly recommend it.P.S. I do not speak or understand Italian, however with this album, it is not necessary because you should let your imagination and dreams interpret his music."
5,A golden voice,"Agree with most of the reviewers, but would like to point out one thing: Russell Watson's Celeste Aida here may not be his best ever, but it's still more heroic and expressive than anybody else's I've heard, and I mean anybody. Could say the same for the clarity and richness of most of this CD. There is a lot of great stuff on this CD, then comes a so-so ""Somewhere"". Skip past one or two so sos , and overall this CD's a marvelous buy. This is a showcase of Watson;s voice. So powerful, so magnicent, he really has a golden voice."
5,A number 1 CD,"This cd is about an amazing voice and a performance of a lifetime. This disc will forever change your appreciation of the human voice. This is a singer who has made opera lovers out of people who would never dare set foot in an opera house. There never has been an artist with such a combination of gifts to change the public view of classical music until now.What makes it even more astounding is his incredible versatility. There are operatic arias, Broadway show tunes, and even a piece that brings the listener in a rock-type mood. Watson not only has a powerful tenor voice but he also displays warmth and sensitivity in his selections.The orchestration and sound are excellent and his voice as good as any from this era. My only wish is I hope someday Watson will record one of his live performances which can often bring out the best in a singer. While we may speculate on what would have been, let us be thankful for what we have. This CD is number one."
1,My kids don't like it,"I played this cd to my kids, hoping to convert them to classical or more serious music. Unfortunately, they don't like it, saying that it's bland and poorly sung! In their view, many of their friends who sing in the choir have a better voice and surer singing skills than Mr Russell Watson. They have no interest to listen to this cd again.If my kids are able to distinguish what's good and bad, I believe that this cd is indeed very bad. In fact, that's my own view, too. However, I thought that Watson's image and approach may do the trick and that kids won't be able to mind those defects in singing.How wrong I've been!"
1,Disappointing encore,"Compared with Russell Watson's 1st album, this new release has shown a lack of imagination in planning as well as a deterioration in the performance.The choice of music here is much less interesting than in 'The Voice'. The singer appears to be not on top form when recording this cd, for his voice often loses its firmness, especially at the top.In all, a disappointing encore."
1,Not convincing,"Russell Watson claims to be a people's tenor. Unfortunately, his performances on this recording are unconvincing because he sings far too badly. It would be an insult to listeners if Russell Watson thinks that the majority of listeners aren't able to distinguish the good from the bad, or that he's of the view that the masses do not deserve the best.This kind of album just won't do."
1,an unworthy encore,"This album is not worth the wait. It's an unworthy encore as the music is so uninspiringly performed, both by the singer and the orchestra. A very disappointing album in many respects."
1,Nothing to offer,"I found this album having little to offer. In the area of cross-over Josh Groban is a much more honest artist, Bocelli has the better technique, Safina has a stronger voice and Frangoulis is more versatile and has better looks. Russell Watson is no match for these true artists."
5,Wonderful new tenor,"I bought this CD without really knowing much about Russell Watson. All I can say is, from the moment I heard his wonderfully rich tenor voice, I just knew I was listening to one of the great tenor voices that I'd ever heard.The classical tracks are fabulous. I was very moved by Ave Maria and thrilled by the gutsy singing in E lucevan le stelle. And what a stunner O sole mio is! His high notes in this aria is to die for, and he puts such feeling into the song. I have other versions of it, but they seem so tepid next to Watson's passionate singing. Plus the fact that other voices seem so thin compared to Watson's. Wonderful new tenor!"
5,Take to a desert island,"If ever you needed to take 1 album with you, this is the one. The vocals are clear and pure...The orchestration and the arrangements---purely beautiful. Other than Russell's VOICE album, you could not go wrong with this collection. Buy it... Listen to it... And most of all enjoy the pure beauty of Watson's voice...At his best."
4,Can't help thinking that Encore was rushed,"On the heels of the successful melodic The Voice, the less inspiring Encore left me wanting Watson selecting material that would showcase his voice with more impact. Encore is safe and predictable. I expect more than ""Volare"" or ""O Sole Mio"" in a follow up album. Bocelli's and Groban's ""The Prayer"" is more fulfilling. However, ""Magic of Love"" with Lionel Ritchie is a sheer delight as is ""E Lucevan Le Steele"". Watson does not disappoint with ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" in that it delivers the so much needed unexpected. Watson excels when it comes to the traditional operatic arias such as ""Celeste Aida"" and ""Va Pensiero"". His raspy rendition of ""Where My Heart Will Take Me"", is a 70's genre melody that is a charming surprise."
1,Not at all good,Much has been said about Russell Watson. I've now listened to this recording. I have to say I don't like it. The singing is unimaginative and musically vulgar. These are charmless renditions and technically defective performances. One star only.
1,Croaking voices,"Russell Watson literally croaks his way through the music. As such, he is unable to do justice to any of the pieces here, be it a classical operatic aria or a pop number. The voice of Russell Watson has shown unmistakable signs of deterioration, and his singing is, as ever, generalised in emotion and unvaried in tone. Listening to this recording is tantamount to having a person screaming at you for an hour at close range. Certainly not a very pleasurable experience, I must say! Russell Watson doesn't know how to interpret music. As a result, this album has little artistic value. I'll give it one star, which is already a very charitable verdict on such a poorly-made album."
1,Is this recording a joke?,"Is this recording a joke?I can't imagine that any serious recording would feature singing that is that bad. In fact, the performances are musically atrocious. It is quite clear, to me at least, that Russell Watson has only got a face but little talent (except in marketing himself through the media). His renditions of the famous songs included here are seriously flawed and grossly sub-standard.Not a recording that one would want to listen to twice."
1,A singer who croaks his way through the music,"I have nothing against cross-over recordings. In fact, many of such recordings have given me and my family much pleasure in the past.Unfortunately, this does not apply to this album by Russell Watson. My chief objection is in the singing, which is inadequate. Watson virtually croaks his way through the music, destroying the musical phrase and glossing over things that make such music great. As a result, he destroys the pieces that he sings, presenting them in a way that is only fit for consumption in the karaoke lounge.I don't think I can recommend this album to anyone."
1,Fantastically bad!,I almost couldn't believe my ears when I first put on this CD. The singing was just horrible. The singer's technique is poor and there're almost no sense of style in these boring performances. Most members in any decent high school choir will be able to do better than the singer here.No marks can be earned at all by such a kind of trashy album.
5,"CD, Simply Perfect!","The title said it all. Wonderful CD by Russell Watson at his best. Starting off with an exciting version of ""Va, pensiero"", and the great standard like ""Volare"", then sliding into a faster tune like ""Is Nothing Sacred"", before performing, without question, one of the best versions of ""Ave Maria"", ever recorded. After this he equals it with a rousing version of ""E lucevan le stelle"" before giving a complete cd/show stopper in ""Bohemian Rhapsody"".This man has talent! Get the cd, it's simply perfect"
1,An unlovable album,The singing in this album is so bad and the interpretation of the songs so uninteresting and boring that I can't find anything lovable in this release.I hope record companies can do more to raise the standard of music appreciation. To produce such badly sung album only does music and its listeners a great disservice.
1,Throaty singing gives no pleasure,"The standard of singing here is unacceptable. In fact, if anyone in my school choir sings that badly, he or she will certainbly be booted out.The singing of Russell Watson has a very throaty quality which makes in voice production to be extremely rough. Unless one enjoys the perverse, this cd gives no pleasure as a sound document. besides, Russell Watson's interpretation are invariably bad, often worse than bad. In my view, this is quite a terrible album."
2,Not as good as the 1st one,I don't think this latest release by Russell Watson is as good as the 1st one. The music selection here is less adventurous and I seem to note that Russell Watson's voice has become a bit more strained than before. The singing is also blander. A disappointment.
1,Can't think of a worst recording,"This recording is the worst that I've heard.The singer, Russell Watson, croaks his way through the music. Not only has he failed to respect the score and bring out the many subtleties of the music, he cannot even deliver the notes properly.I'm really put off by such a terrible promotion of bad singing."
1,immature singing,I don't understand why the record company is willing to release such a cd by an immature singer. The singing here is terribly substandard and also unmusical. I am afraid the singer has to learn a few years to singing before he can produce something that is nearer to a decent performance.
5,Great singing by a magnificent voice,"I'm glad to report the singing of Russell Watson has gone from great to outstanding. While he showed brilliance in his first album, both his voice and the standard of singing improved more so in his 2nd album.A wonderful encore."
1,Grading each component,I'll just grade the various components of this recording:Vocal quality: DSinging Skills: EInterpretation: EMusic selection: DOrchestra: CEngineering: DPresentation: BMarketing: A
1,A complete failure,"I hope those who enjoy this cd won't be too angry if I say that I consider this cd a complete failure. Of course, different people will have different views on any given thing. However, after listening to this cd a few times, not only do I find it not enjoyable at all, I can also hear lots of flaws in the singing. For example, there are the tremulous tone, the over strident note, the shortness in breath, the colorless voice, the inability to sustain a phrase to its end, the sloppiness in articulation and the failure to respond to words. These are all serious defects which cannot be overlooked. I therefore regard this cd as a complete failure."
1,Bocelli is much better!,"As the singing is so substandard in Encore, I think Russell Watson is far less good that Andrea Bocelli, who is a much greater artist.Just listen to Watson's singing. He can't even sing in the correct pitch. How can he be called a tenor if he has to transpose? Bocelli need not do that, and he has sung opera in an opera house without amplification. Watson will never be able to do that!"
1,karaoke standard,"I've bought this CD and am disappointed by it.Much of the singing here is just of karaoke standard. I think many in the karaoke can sing better than the singer featured here, who cannot even hold a note to proper length. He certainly cannot (and does not) do justice to the ambitious program assembled for him by the producer.Not worth getting at full price."
1,No match for Frangoulis,"I agree with those who say that Russell Watson is less good than Mario Frangoulis.Frangoulis does have a more beautiful and strong voice than Watson, and his singing skills are much better, too. He is also more handsome and hunky than Watson.Frangoulis, instead of Watson, is the real people's tenor."
1,An affront to the listener's intellect,"I find it quite appalling that a record company can give such high profile marketing to such a poorly produced recording! If Mr Watson and his recording company think that ordinary listeners (and especially those who're not well versed with classical music) can make do with such a kind of singing. They're being absolutely wrong!In my view, if one sincerely wishes to convert other people to classical music, one should try to display the best attributes and characteristics of such music such that listeners can be convinced of its merits. Unfortunately, Mr Watson does such a nasty job here that I can either imagine that people be scared away or that they'll be misled into thinking that classical music is like that.The whole project is an affront to the listener's intellect, especially when it is executed in such a bad way. It deserves no mark at all."
1,Not worth the money and effort,"I'm afraid that this album isn't worth its value at full price. The singing is just very substandard. In fact, it doesn't even worth to be put on the CD player. Just a waste of time.However, I think it's a mandatory acquisition for anyone who wants to know what bad singing is. Also, it can demonstrate the length that modern studio engineers and producers can go in order to patch up a voice in shreds.Otherwise, buy at your peril."
1,Poorly sung recording,"The singing in this cd is amongst the worst that I've ever encountered. Besides the appalling singing skills, the renditions just do not communicate with the listening. There's no variety in tone and emotions for most of the songs. That makes this cd a very bland and forgettable one."
3,His wrost CD,I have all 4 of Russell's Cd's and this is by far his wrose.The Classical stuff is great but The pop stuff is some of the wrose pop stuff he has even done.
5,"Watson loves what he does, SING","This CD truly has Russell Watson at his very best. Hardly a week goes by that I don't listen to it at least once!!! You can tell in his voice that he loves what he does. If you don't already have all these songs, then I strongly recommend that you get this CD."
5,Encore,"I now have THREE copies of this wonderful Album, the UK version, the New Zealand version and now the US version, and with additional tracks on every CD, it to me just goes from strength to strength as does The Voice. What an incredible sound, covering such a wide range from Grand Opera to TV Themes, what do the opera snobs know, you don't have Pavorotti or Domingo to be allowed to sing opera, the same as you don't have to be Freddie Mercury or Meatloaf to sing rock and Russell Watson proves he can do both with such ease and finesse. I would by this album if released in another 10 countries as long as I got an extra track on each one."
1,Poorly produced recording,This recording is poorly produced. The selection of music is unimaginative and the performance itself is far from satisfactory. I don't enjoy it at all.
1,Just a face,There is no musical substance in this album. I can only see a rather good-looking man on the CD cover. That's all. The singing is very substandard indeed.
1,Bad singing all the way,"I can't understand why some people keep saying that this album is good. In my view, that's probably one of the worst vocal album ever released! The singing is bad all the way. Russell Watson's limited vocal abilities are put to a hard test by the music, and he almost invariably fails every time he is faced with any vocal challenge. I can derive no pleasure at all from listening to this CD."
1,"No, No, No","Please, Russell, go back to welding. Or get a teacher and pick songs that fit your strange, pinched voice. I bought this CD since the label on the cover said, ""This is the CD you've been waiting for!"" and after one time through it I chucked it out the window of my car. I pity the person who finds it and listens to it."
1,Badly produced album,How come a CD of such poor quality can be released commercially to the general public at such an outrageous price?It should be plainly evident to all that the singing on this album is of unacceptably low quality. None of the tracks here appeals. I cannot think of another album that is as bad as this one.An entirely worthless recording.
5,Watson is addicting,"After witnessing Russell Watson's Now is the Hour program from New Zealand on PBS, I have to agree this is one of the finest performers that absolutely captivates his audience with warmth, humor and tremendous talent. His Encore Cd includes most of the songs performed at this concert.Russell Watson's songs become more enchanting each time you listen to them! I often find myself singing them during the course of the day. His style of singing is fun, light, and uplifting. It's addicting! I highly recommend adding all of his available CD's to your musical library!"
1,Singing too flawed,"The singing on this cd is far too flawed for it to be enjoyable.Russell Watson's voice is of mediocre quality. The dryish timbre is particularly annoying. Unfortunately, his singing technique is even worse, making his performances a trial to the ear.One star."
1,Extremely unsatisfactory performance,"This performances on this cd is extremely unsatisfactory. Russell Watson just can't sing properly. His technique is seriously flawed and his interpretations are uncommunicative. The performances, as a result, are unmusical and boring.This is a cd that will only appeal to []fans of the singer."
1,Worst singing I've ever heard,This cd is quite terrible. The singing here is the worst I've ever heard on a commercial release. Not only is Russell Watson not a classical singer - he is far from able to do justice to the music - his dryish tonal quality and his abysmal singing technique make this recording very unpleasant to the ear.How can such a bad recording can be sold in the market at full price?
1,An unformed singer,"It is clearly an error for Decca to release an album in full price by a singer who is yet unformed. Russell Watson's singing is not only short in charm, it is also full of defects and stylistic flaws. His work in this album cannot be compared with the hundreds of better versions that are available in the catalogues. Clearly a failed attempt as far as artistic merits are concerned."
2,Letdown from the first album,Russell Watson needs to stay within his means and not sing more delicate songs like the Ave Maria and O Sole Mio. He lacks the style and nuance to pull these off effectively. His harsh treatment of diction in the delicate moments seriously detracts from the musical integrity. His first album was MUCH better and highly recommended. Not this one
1,I don't like it,"I don't like this album at all. The singing is clumsy and unmusical. The performances are bland and uninteresting. Just what kind of singer this Russell Watson is, what can ruin the music so completely?"
5,Watson will give you hours of musical pleasure,"Contains a wonderful mix of classical and pop songs and more. I've waited many years for a singer to excite me as Russell Watson has on this CD. It's one of the best albums ever!The mood set by these songs are so invigorating and pleasureful. I grew up listening to these classical songs; they are a part of our family tradition. ""Volare"", ""O Sole Mio"", ""Mattinata"", ""Che gelida manina"" and even the dramatic """"E lucevan le stelle"" provided many hours of classical music for our quiet evenings.If you love the tenor voice, Russell Watson will give you a perfect evening of wonderful music. As an added bonus, he also has a great pop voice."
1,Worst album that I've heard,Russell Watson's 'Encore' is by far the worst album that I've heard. The main reason for my distaste is the singer's appalling singing. He cheats the music of its true power by his inadequate singing. The voice is also no that good. I've borrowed Russell Watson's 1st cd and I found that the singing in this 2nd cd is worse. The quality of voice has also deteriorated. What a bad showing!
1,Only the cover is good,"I can only find one good thing about this recording - its cover design. As far as the singing is concerned, it is a substandard release. Russell Watson simply doesn't have the right kind of voice to perform the music. The result is embarrassing."
1,"Poor voice, little talent","It is evident that the singer in this cd, Russell Watson, is a singer with a poor voice and little natural talent.Not only is his interpretations stylistically incorrect, he also has to simplify the music to suit his limited vocal abilities.The voice itself is of unremarkable quality, and it also sounds reedy in medium range and strident at the top.Coupled with a faulty technique, the singing is, to be honest, rather unpleasant for most of the duration of this cd.While this cd may satisfy some, musically it is a virtual disaster."
1,What a bore!,"I've never listened to a more boring CD!Although Russell Watson does have a voice, his singing is without passion. Very boring and unengaging! Just like the singing of a robot.It is a great pity that Russell Watson has not put his God given voice into better use."
1,I don't like it,"Having listened to this album, I can now say it loud and clear: I don't like it!I don't know Russell Watson personally. He also seems to have a clean image. I'm only therefore commenting on his singing on this album.It is bad. Very bad. His shortness of breath is surprising as many a pop artist can do better than him. (I'm a pop fan.) If he claims to be an opera singer, I'd expect he can do much better.Anyway, this kind of stuff just won't bring me to classical music or opera. No way. It'll require a much better singing to do the trick.In the meantime, I'll just donate off this album. I don't care to listen to it again. Just a waste of my time."
5,My number 1 album this year,"Russell Watson brings his magnificent tenor to the lush, expansive orchestral arrangments, and the two compliment each other perfectly. A superb selection of songs showing the trueness of his voice, his ability to transport a melody and (again) his excellent enunciation and wonderful phrasing and breath control.Whether it be his wonderful opening number, ""Va, pensiero,"" or the beautiful ""Ave Maria ,"" or the tender rendering of ""You Are So Beautiful,"" this collection showcases Russell Watson's amazing talents in a grand and memorable fashion. Of particular interest is the altogether exciting alternative version Watson provides for in ""Bohemian Rhapsody.""The lush arrangements, the versatile Russell Watson, and the classical arias all come together to make this my number one album this year."
5,Russell Watson scores again!!,"Russell Watson's Encore is magnificant! The fact that he can sing in two or three completely different musical styles, sometimes even in the same piece, is simply unbelieveable. His pop voice is mellow and compelling. His operatic tenor renditions are nothing less than soul stiring.I am not an opera ""snob,"" but I do know a grand talent when I hear one."
5,"Please Russell, Come to Vegas!","I discovered the magic of Russell Watson from his album, THE VOICE. I now find that in this second album, Russell Watson's voice is much more pure and clear and he has several more voices in his repertoire!! I began purchasing all of the different versions of Encore, and I must say I'm very impressed. Encore, no matter which version you buy, is a fantastic mix of pop and classical. If you do not know who Russell Watson is, you must buy this album. My only other comment is, Please Russell, come to Vegas for a concert!!"
5,"Bravo Russell, you are the consummate artist!!!","I am a long-time Russell Watson fan (3 years!!!) He is one singer who improves on his albums unlike other singers who seem to just produce the same product or voice, CD after CD. Russell is creative, innovative and exciting and changing his voice and style, when needed. In this album, Russell has embraced a more stylish musical genre, and I just adore it! Every song is just beautiful! His voice is as smooth, raspy, soft, powerful, lilting, everything!. A most perfect CD. Bravo Russell, you are the consummate artist!"
5,"Encore, a great CD, beautiful voice","Listening to this, I just wish some of those composers (Verdi, Puccini, etc.) were alive today, so they can appreciate Russell Watson's beautiful and powerful tenor voice.To say that Watson is the best opera singer in the world would be unfair. After all, he's still young by opera standards. He's no Domingo, but give him a few years and he will be challenging the top tenors.I agree with those reviewers who consider Watson to have a 'beautiful voice'. Watson truly is the peoples tenor. He must have something magical to attract so many fans."
5,5 Stars!!!,"I can understand how people can describe Russell Watson's voice as one having a ""tremendous range"". When you listen to this CD, he indeed has such a range. In fact, with this tremendous range, Russell Watson sings everything with much emotional variation. And I agree with those who say that Watson has a clear, powerful tenor voice that definitely attracts non-classical fans. He is truly opening the doors of classical music to everyone and that is somthing no one has ever done before. 5 Stars!!"
5,The success of Russell Watson,"The chief success of Russell Watson is that his singing is so communicative to the listener. Even though Watson has a powerful voice, he can still be so sensitive unlike many singers. There's so much substance and subtlety in his renditions of the music, some of which are outstandingly arranged.A wonder of an album!"
1,Cross-over singing at its worst,"I love cross-over. But it must be done by vocally competently and temperamentally charming artists. Russell Watson isn't amongst this group, as his singing is inadequate and boring. Track after track, Mr. Watson produces ugly sounds and bland interpretations. I certainly don't enjoy hearing a full hour of noise like this.An utterly disappointing CD."
1,I prefer Frangoulis,"Originally, I think Russell Watson is OK as a singer. However, after listening to Mario Frangoulis, I now realise that what Russell Watson can give me is very unsatisfactory. I think Frangoulis is by far the better singer. He is more handsome too! If you listen more to Frangoulis, you will now that the boring singing in this cd, Encore, is just not nice at all."
1,No good at all,That's no good at all. The singing is unspeakably bad and without any feeling. The acoustics of the recording is quite terrible. The play of the music is unimaginative. Can you think of any vocal recording that is worse than this one? I can't.
5,What a voice!!!,"What a voice!!! Everything I want in music is in this album. Russell Watson, who can sing everything, again deserves the accolades given to him for this wonderful CD. Listen to O sole mio and see how he sustains those difficult notes, and the power of his voice the in faster musical passages.Like so many others, I also find his singing is so heart-felt and communicative. His performances on this album are uniformly filled with color and emotion.I'm so happy in having bought this album."
5,Superior album,The songs are top notch and so are Russell's singing!The musical arrangements and tempos are again sensational in backing up the great voice of Watson.Russell's second album is superior!
5,Sheer perfection,"It's obvious from the reviews that this album has monumental impact. Even without his outstanding pop tracks, it would be a masterpiece due to his brilliant singing and musical arrangements of the classical songs.Watson is at his best and you have sheer musical perfection. If it doesn't hit you -- you have no heart. Buy it and experience a talented singer."
5,No longer a casual listener of music,This is the first Watson CD I bought and probably the first of many I will begin buying. The reason why is simply this: he is the most versatile and talented singer I have ever heard in recent years AND I feel as though he's singing personally to me.It contains wonderful classical and pop tracks that keep you pleasantly surprised. I am generally just a casual listener of music but not any more. Watson has changed it all
5,"I Love ""Is Nothing Sacred""","I had no clue who Russell Watson was until he appeared on the Carolyn Rhea show awhile back. After I heard him sing on her show, I was ecstatic that I found out who he was and I am glad I did. This album is a must have. The blend of classical and pop music is exciting and every track is wonderful. ""Is Nothing Sacred"" has become my new favorite song. It is a beautiful song and in my opinion it is the best song on the whole album."
1,Watson is no singer,"I haven't heard Russell Watson live. But from what I heard on this recording, Watson is definitely no singer. He has little voice and a broken technique. He sings without much style or feeling. It's definitely worst than many performances that I heard at the karaoke."
1,Unappealing interpretations,"I simply can't see how the interpretations on this recording can be called ""good"" or even ""superb"". To these ears, not only is the singing here technically below par, the interpretations are all similar with little variety in feeling. Such all-purpose blandness pervades the entire recording. None of the tracks can be said to be well sung or moving.It's a long long time since I heard anything so unstandard and boring."
1,Angry at the low standard,I bought this cd after reading those good reviews. I'm therefore extremely angered by the low standard of the performance on this cd. The singer here just can't sing! Listening to his painful singing is certainly no joy. His unemotional way of singing also leaves me cold.I hope those who consider buying this should try and listen to it first before doing so.
5,Another step to success,"This is a wonderful, magnificent CD that I have listened to over and over again. I urge all those who have not yet purchased this CD to purchase it now. You won't come away feeling cheated.You'll come away feeling Russell Watson's joy of singing classical and pop songs with a voice that is strong, stable and incredibly forceful-(""E luce van le stelle"", ""O sole mio"") and at the same time, singing the softer songs (""You Are So Beautiful"", ""Magic of Love"") with emotion and care, with the kind of sensitivity you would expect from these songs.You will appreciate this young man who has ascended above so much adversity to claim yet another stepping stone to success in his career."
5,Top-notch CD,"A great starting point for anyone putting together a Watson collection. What a voice -- tender, tough, vulnerable and honest! No wonder Watson's career has skyrocketed in a few short years.Highlights include: ""Va, pensiero"", ""Volare"", ""Nothing Sacred"", ""O sole mio"".... Actually, every track on this CD! Many fans consider Russell's current cd ""Reprise"" his best because of more emphasis on the classical music. This may be true, but Encore has such a variety of music you will love it. His golden voice is at its peak and the songs he covers, timeless beauties.Overall, ""Encore"" is a top-notch collection of music. While Watson's classical fans will no doubt opt for ""Reprise"", the casual fans will surely be satisfied with ""Encore"". This is, quite simply, one of the best CDs of all time. Highly recommended."
5,Brilliant cd!,"If you like Watson this CD is an absolute must. Music, arrangements etc, are brilliant, and Watson only elevates his music.Every review previous to mine is absolutely on target. This is Russell at his best....versatile, powerful, tender, everything... Buy it and enjoy."
1,Singer of little talent and poor voice,"Following on the commercial success of his 1st album, Russell Watson has released a 2nd album. Unfortunately, the singer's voice, which sounds unimpressive in the 1st album, appears to have deteriorated by the time he recorded this album. His tone is here often tremulous and dry and the voice is has even less beauty and power than before.It is all the more disappointing that Russell Watson's artistry has no matured to any extent after the release of the 1st album. His performances of the various songs here (in a music selection that is less interesting than that in the 1st album) is boring. Maybe this shows that the singer indeed has little talent in performance. But I still would have expect more emotional variations in the performances.As can be seen from what I've written, this recording is, to me, an utter disappointment."
1,Good music trivialised by poor performance.,"I've read some of the recent reviews here and I found it absurd that some keep on saying that Russell Watson is a talented singer who delivers ""opera"" well.Has Russell Watson ever sung opera? Is his kind of singing operatic? I seems that certain fans of the singer just can't (and won't) appreciate some basic facts.In my opinion, this cd is an embarrassment to the singer. Not only does it reveals Russell Watson is poor voice (actually, worse than that displayed in his first album), it shows how good or even great music can be trivialised by poor performances.What a waste..."
1,Not up to standard,"As classical singing, what one hears on this album is definitely not up to standard.As far as cross-over albums are concerned, this one is also below par as the performances lack charm.I don't think this kind of sub-standard stuff can be a good and proper introduction to classical music.I'm giving it thumbs down."
5,You can't lose with Watson's music,"What more is there to add to the great reviews of this album? It's Russell Watson, that was enough for me to make the decision of purchasing this set. I don't regret it either. With Watson's music, you can't lose."
5,Russell is a captivating and gifted performer,"This CD is a wonderful collection of classical and pop music by a truly gifted performer.Russell's version of ""Che galida manina"" and ""E lucevan le stelle"" are incredibly dramatic and powerful. ""Is Nothing Sacred"" is a very thought provoking song and his singing is so captivating.As is always the case when Russell Watson sings in Italian, the listener does not have to understand the language. He is one performer who can communicate through the emotion of his singing and that comes across on every song on this CD.It is an outstanding collection of some old Italian classics and some more modern songs sung like no one else can."
5,"A singer with a voice,","Russell Watson no doubt has good looks. Fortunately, his looks matches his voice.Watson has a ""voice"" and then some. By this, I mean that his voice is in wonderful shape - tremendous range, secure intonation, raspy or smooth voice for pop songs, much flexibility etc. etc.His singing definitely satisfys on this recording."
5,Watson surprises on every track,"With the release of this album, Russell has done it again! Just when you think he sings pop with a raspy voice, he does pop-rock with a rock-type smooth voice (""Bohemian Rhapsody"")..when you think he does pop, he does ""Somewhere"" in a semiclassical voice, now when he has you wondering what will come next, he does a combination of several styles. And then comes opera, ""O sole mio"", ""Mattinata"" ""Che gelida manina"" and on on.We're lucky to have this newest musical gift from Russell Watson."
5,This is Russell's voice and you won't forget it,"One of his best! Russell was never in better voice and he puts his own touch on each song with great arrangements. He doesn't sound like Pavarotti or any of the cross-overs. This is Russell's voice and when you listen to this CD, It is Russell's voice you will remember."
5,Watson at his best,"This music album by Russell Watson is one of the best things I've ever spent my money on! His tenor voice just melts every bit of my heart and certainly earns the 5 star rating, many times over. He is an excellent performer with every song he sings.Russell Watson has been a favorite performer of mine for the last year. I don't think there's anyone who is not a classical purist or enemy in the world who wouldn't enjoy this CD. It's guaranteed to give you countless hours of enjoyment and good feelings when listening to it. There's something in this collection for everybody.Russell is at his best. You will enjoy this CD. It will bring out the feelings inside your heart. So what are you waiting for, get it and enjoy."
5,Extraordinary talent,"Russell Watson has a truly extraordinary talent that can span both the operatic and the popular genre. With time his voice can only help but improve to near perfection.If one has to criticize (and I'm nitpicking here) perhaps a touch less vibrato would sometimes purify the sound but the power is amazing. One other point - I must disagree with some of the reviewers who liked Watson's Somewhere, although good, that was the one track that could have been omitted as other singer's versions such as Barbara Streisand's really cannot be surpassed.That said, to repeat again, Watson is extraordinary!!It will be interesting to see which music Watson will choose once he becomes popular in the United States as he is now in England."
1,Let down by the hype,"I've been let down by all that exaggerated hyping surrounding Russell Watson. He definitely is not as great as some would make him. In fact, his singing is quite appalling as he hasn't even grasp the basics of voice production. This album makes painful listening and should never have seen the light of the day.I'm terribly disappointed with it."
1,Fed up after listening to it once,"I'm greatly annoyed and disappointed by this poorly produced album. The selection of music is wide-ranging and interesting. Unfortunately, the singing here is so inadequate that listening to this album is almost a painful experience.The singer's high notes are unpleasant and under-powered (even when the songs are recorded in the studio), many of the sustained notes are cut off prematurely, presumably because the singer has run out of breath. Vocal ornaments have been glossed over and there is a seriously lack of dynamic variety in the singing.I've already given up this album after listening to it once, for I can't bear subjecting myself to such bad singing again."
1,Amongst the worst that I've ever heard,"This cd is definitely amongst the worst recordings that I've ever heard. (I have with me over 3,000 recordings of different genres.)The basic problem of this cd is the singing, which ranges from the barely acceptable to the downright atrocious. I have rarely, if ever, heard music to be sung so poorly, so unimaginatively and with so little regard as to musical details and the words. Whatever smart image that the singer has been presented in, it cannot compensate for the many deficiencies here. After all, when one puts on a cd, one will be listening to the music instead of watching the singer's face!No, such a poor quality recording just can't do."
1,Amazing CD in some ways,"I recently bought this CD and I found it pretty amazing, although in a rather negative sort of way.Much of the singing here is substandard. The singer, Russell Watson, doesn't not have a secure technique. As a result, his singing is vocally haphazard to say the least. Since he has to struggle for vocal survival, this doesn't leave much room for interpretation. The natural consequence of this is that the singing is undifferentiated and uniformly bland.Prior to writing this review, I've read some of the recent comments by listeners. I'm so amazed that some people can go to such length in praising the singer as to totally mis-represent what one can hear on this CD.That's why I consider this an amazing CD, even though it has little artistic or musical value."
1,Bad encore,"What bad singing this album contains!None of the tracks here is up to standard. The singer's immense vocal flaws are plainly evident in almost every phrase that he does. Flat high notes, chopped up phrases, glossed over details and incorrect style etc. etc.An almost totally worthless album!"
1,Terrible encore,"One usually encounters an encore when an performer has given an excellent performance and that the audience demands an encore.Here, despite his making a greatly substandard first album, the singer, Russell Watson, has made a second album which proves to be even worse. The standard of singing here is simply unacceptable.There shouldn't be such an encore in the first place."
1,Unplesant encore,"Wow, the singing here is very bad!How come such poor recording can be released? I think the record company should at least insist upon the singer re-recording the majority of the tracks here! Better still to find another singer to go this recording.I can't recommend this recording to anyone."
1,Doing a disservice to music,"This sort of album is doing a grave disservice to music. A friend of mine has bought this album, hoping that it'll convert her 2 kids to classical music. Unfortunately, the singing on this recording is so bad that not only aren't the kids impressed by it, they said that any curiosity they have on this type of music were snuffed out after hearing such poor performances.But that can only be expected, for Russell Watson isn't a classical singer and his singing technique is woefully inadequate. But to release such a kind of album, and to make such inflatory claims about it, is doing a grave disservice to music."
1,Can't compre with Bocelli,"Russell Watson can't hold a candle to Andrea Bocelli. The singing of the former lacks technique, grace, charm and style, qualities which one can find in abundance in the singing (and cds) of the latter.As such, this album gives poor value for money as there're lots of better things on offer in the market."
1,Watson misses the mark,"Russell Watson has missed the mark again. Unable to learn from his mistakes in The Voice, the singer has again attempted to perform music that is beyond his reach. Just listen to ""Che gelida manina"" and you're hear some of the most labored singing ever committed to record."
2,Far less good that the 1st album,I found this 2nd album of Russell Watson to be far less good than the first one. The music here is less interesting and the performance of the singer is not that good. Is Russell Watson so satisfied with his success that he cares less about production standards?
1,A compromise that doesn't work,"This is in many ways a disappointing release. In trying to show that Russell Watson is a versatile singer, his record company has ambitiously created for him a very taxing program. Of course, no one is expected to encompass all musical genres with ease and compromises in the singing can only be expected. However, Russell Watson has done less well than expected even when one bears in mind the nature of this project. He not only isn't able to provide any modicum of the diverse musical styles required by the songs, he also sounds uncomfortable in many of the more demanding songs and arias. As a result, this project cannot be called a success. For the ordinary listener, this release also makes quite uncomfortable listening too. I don't think this kind of recording project can do any service to the music, or the singer for that matter."
1,No way!,"This album just can't do. The performances range from bad to terrible. Russell Watson has no technique and little interpretive talent, and he makes a mess out of the music."
1,No match for Mario Frangoulis,"Somebody wrote that Russell Watson is no match for Andrea Bocelli. I agree.However, I think Mr Watson's shortcomings are highlighted even more when compared with the wonderful Mario Frangoulis. Mr Frangoulis has a much more beautiful voice and superb singing technique. He looks much more handsome than the uninspiring Watson too."
1,One of the worst that I've heard,The singing in this album is one of the worst that I've heard. Russell Watson's smallish voice and ill-formed technique can in no way do justice to the music. His lack of interpretative talent is also an obstacle when he trys to convey any feeling to the listener. A totallyl insipid recording.
5,Everythings all right with the world,"I have CDs of every singer imaginable, including a few classics. When I've had a horrible day or I'm down in the dumps there is only one singer who gets me out of my doldrums - Russell Watson! Why? Who knows?All I know is that I am the happiest person in the world when I listen to this CD. VOLARE makes me happy, IS NOTHING SACRED gets me up and I want to shout, AVE MARIA inspires me, YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL gets me so overjoyed with tears, E LUCE VAN LE STELLE and O SOLE MIO lifts me up to the sky, and BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY and WHERE MY HEART WILL TAKE ME make me realize what a remarkable singer Russell Watson is and the criticisms he receives from the opera critics to whatever source don't mean a thing to me because Watson makes my day.My husband occasionally will get tired of listening to him 24-7 but even he will announce to me of pending Russell appearances on TV or a new single or CD. Thank you Russell for making my life so beautiful with your ""voice""!"
1,Disappointing,I heard much hype about Russell Watson. Bought this cd and found it totally disappointing. That level of singing can't even be accepted in any decent school or church choir. How come such a cd can be retailed at full price? Quite outrageous!
1,Disappointment,Well after waiting for so long for this CD to be released I can safely say that this CD is a real disappointment and I fear will soon end up on the two for one sale counter. It seems Russell Watson grabbed at anything he could find and slapped it together on this CD. It is a major disaster and a poor excuse for a singer who I thought had potential afer the release of The Voice. Lets hope he can quickly correct his errors with his third CD. At this rate he will be left behind in the dust.
1,Substandard,"Are there now any standards in the production of recordings? If there are, how come that this abysmally bad recording got to be released? The singing on this recording is simply terrible! Many more talented children in junior high school choirs can sing infinitely better than the singer featured here. I'm pretty aghast at such substandard stuff!"
1,No match for Bocelli,"The singing here is no match for the much finer achievements of Andrea Bocelli. In my view, Bocelli has a more beautiful voice, a more secure technique and a much better musicianship. The Italian also sings with a heart. Russell Watson just can't hold a candle to him in the cross-over repertoire. This cd is therefore not competitive at all."
1,Worse than bad,"Frankly, I would have liked to award this CD no star had it been possible! The singing here is unspeakably bad and the orchestral parts are indifferently played.I won't judge Mr Watson by using the criteria applicable to classical tenors, for Mr Watson doesn't belong to that category. However, as a cross-over artist, he still fails miserably as he lacks artistry and even a decent voice.In the cross-over repertory, Andrea Bocelli has a better technique, Alessandro Safina has a stronger voice, Groban is a more communicative artist, Mario Frangoulis has more handsome looks, Charlotte Churh has more innocence and charm and Opera Babes are far more innovative. By contrast, Russell Watson has little to offer no matter in what aspect.What a miserable failure this recording is."
1,That won't do,"This kind of album should only be attempted by a charismatic singing with a firm voice and solid technique. Russell Watson has none of these qualities. As a result, the performances all fall flat. Very flat indeed. Such a substandard album shouldn't have been released at all."
5,Not a fan of crossover singers except Watson,"I have always loved the opera, being a Met regular. I was not a fan or even a listener of the new breed of cross-over artists until I heard Russell Watson at Carnegie Hall in New York.His voice is indeed versatile, his opera voice for the classical arias, a second voice for rock-type songs and a third voice for singing broadway type music. It is with the classical musice that he really displays his magnificent voice and just shines. His performance at Carnegie Hall led me to buy this cd.""O sole mio"", ""Mattinata"" and ""E lucevan le stelle"" are sung brilliantly. My favorite, however, is ""Che gelida manina.The songs on this cd are most enjoyable although I would prefer more classical music. I am told that his next album will have more emphasis on classical music which should showcase Watson's voice even more so. Really good music is hard to come by and this cd is truly a gem. Buy this cd!"
1,Totally disappointing,This recording is totally disappointing. Rusell Watson's singing is technically unassured and he appears to be unaware of the different stylistic demands of the pieces that he sings. Such perfunctory singing and performance attitude is to be deplored.
1,Voiceless encore,"How baffling that a voiceless singing can have the chance to release a 2nd album where many much more talented singers are swept to the side-lines! I just shows how deplorable the state of affairs has become in the music industry.I find nothing to recommend in this album. Just listen to it, any track, and you'll find a voiceless singer trying desperately to sing songs that he cannot cope with. Unless one enjoy such a kind of labored singing, this album can bring no pleasure. Besides, such poor singing should never be imitated by anyone, unless one wants to lose one's voice after a few years.One star, at most."
1,A recording of little or no merit,"Russell Watson often calls himself the ""people's singer"". However, does he mean that by bringing classical music to a wider audience, he can neglect the standard of his singing or that he can present the public with substandard recordings by assuming that the public would not notice his defects?I'm greatly offended by such artistic hypocrisy! If Mr Watson sincerely and genuinely wishes to promote classical music amongst the masses, he should try to present the music in its best light rather than simplifying, distorting and dismembering the music so that much of its artistic and musical value got lost as a result. Not only is Mr Watson doing a grave injustice to the music, he is also belittling his listeners in thinking that they do not deserve the best.Consequently, this recording has little or no merit whether as a record of singing or as a means for the promotion of classical music."
1,Singing worst than most choir boys,"I wonder if people realise that the singing on this CD is worse than that of most choir boys. It appears that the singer here, Russell Watson, is incapable of singing well in even the simplest of phrases. Needless to say, he stumbles embarrassingly in the more strenuous passages.Another complaint is that his singing has little communicative power. The reason for this is that he doesn't seem to know what the music and the lyrics are about. As a result, he sings in a boring manner, giving each song the same generalized feeling.There's no question that Decca is marketing Russell Watson very well, and there're always some fans who would praise him to the skies. But if one purely talk about music and singing, this album has definitely failed to make the grade.A total disappointment (and a musical disaster)."
1,Can't think of a worst album,"This album is really terrible - the performance by Russell Watson has little charm and is technically atrocious. Honestly I really can't think of a worse album that I've listened to.I think Mr Watson should take some vocal lessons before going into the recording studio again. Otherwise, it's being irresponsible to the record purchasing public.I would award this album zero star."
5,"Perfect CD, have all versions of it!","My boy-friend bought this album for me last week because it contained my favorite Russell Watson song: Va, pensiero. I also purchased the New Zealand version and have recently began playing it when my boy-friend and I are enjoying a quiet dinner or just relaxing.Candles, moonlight, the stars, and Russell -- it doesn't get better than that"
5,"Musical smorgasbord, hugely enjoyable","Clearly resembling or even influenced by Mario Lanza of the 50's, Russell Watson's classical vocals are eerily alike this great singer, but without the hard edge that Lanza had.This album is an entertaining journey through a musical smorgasbord. Watson's phrasing, timing and swinging vocals combine to make it hugely enjoyable .Highlights of the album, which doesn't have a weak performance, include Va, pensiero, Is Nothing Sacred, You Are So Beautiful, Che gelida manina, Bohemian Rhapsody, and Celeste Aida.If you happen by chance to check Russell Watson's albums, listen to samples of the songs, then don't hesitate to add it to your collection. The songs speak for themselves, but all 16 are performed professionally, tastefully and with great feeling."
1,An album of low standard,"This certainly is an album of low standard.In terms of selection of music, the contents of this album prove to be quite unimaginative.The singing is the biggest weakest here, with the singer, Russell Watson, being unable to sing properly even the easiest song in this album.I also don't like the orchestral playing, which sounds all too overblown and unsubtle.The album is not a very enjoyable one, I'm afraid."
1,Lacking in finesse and style,"I've read that some people say that Russell Watson has a 'broad range' just because he has attempted many different kinds of songs in his albums. But have they considered that Watson, whose singing lacks finesse and style, fails in most of the song types? I don't think one can be called a singer of 'broad range' by merely attempt different kind of things. He must do them (or most of them) well before he can achieve true versatility. Otherwise, I croaking singing can also call himself versatile by singing (abysmally) the songs in this album. Be rational. Do have some minimum standard, please.In my view, the singing here is not acceptable at all. Indeed, it often amounts to an embarrassing revelation of the singer's many shortcomings. A parody of music this recording can only be."
5,"Troubled world, We can escape with Watson's voice","Should it be any surprise that another Watson album is doing so well in a time filled with such conflict? With his music, he helps us escape back into a world in its best of days, filled more with innocent happiness.We need more of Watson to brighten our days."
2,puzzling,"I bought Russell Watson's debut album and thought it was quite decent. It seems that for this album, Mr. Watson degraded his singing potential level as well as the selection of songs. He has a powerful voice for opera but his voice doesn't quite match the ""pop"" genre. I think Russell sings well but is mixing too much with his musical selection. Personally, I hope that his next major release would contain more opera pieces."
1,A cross-over joke,"I consider this album a cross-over joke.In trying to show his versatility, Russell Watson takes on music with a wide range of styles. Unfortunately, he sings them with just one single style. Not only is his singing unidiomatic, this is not even cross-over as Russell Watson just fails to cross-over the different musical styles - he remains resolutely on the same inch of ground all through.A boring album and a musical failure."
1,Lousy singing,"Russell Watson may have a ""face"". Yet, he is woefully inadequate as a singer, for the singer on this recording is simply lousy and ungraceful.This recording represents poor value for money as it is sold at full price."
1,Bad singing,"The singing of Russell Watson is simply bad. I listened to this cd twice and have no further intention to play it. Nothing interesting, nothing enjoyable. What a disappointment!"
1,Encore falls flat,"The first album of Russell Watson is quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, this follow-up falls very flat indeed. The voice of Russell Watson has deteriorated in quality and his singing becomes unaccceptably hoarse. Quite terrible sounds emerge from this recording. The music selection is also much less interesting than the debut album."
1,Not match for Bocelli,"I don't think this album can match the much better releases of Bocelli, and even Safina. Russell Watson's voice is much less powerful than the aforementioned two, and his almost has no technique. If Bocelli and Safina deserve four star, this can only get at most one."
1,Watson is no talent,"It is clear from this recording that Russell Watson has very limited talent in singing. Putting aside the problems of his voice, which is uneven and coarse for most of the time, his singing is completely charmless. I wonder if he knows what the songs are about.This album is a total disappointment!"
1,Poor demonstration of versatility,"It is quite clear that Russell Watson and his producers hope to demonstrate the versatility of the singer by putting together a set of music which contains many different musical styles. Unfortunately, such intention has backfired as Russell Watson is unable to perform all those songs to a reasonable standard. Just attempting to sing such different kinds of music is not by itself the hallmark of versatility, in particular when one performs as badly as Russell Watson. Honestly, I think Russell Watson, instead of being a versatile singer, is a singer of a rather narrow stylistic range. He performs best when doing music of no great diffculty and those written in a narrow range. Otherwise, his singing can become plain ugly. Having regard to the standard of singing here, I can only give this CD one star."
1,From bad to worse,"The first album by Russell Watson is quite a bad one, for the singer didn't have the technique and experience to bring the music to life.Unfortunately, the singing here in his 2nd album is worse! His voice has deteriorated and he is even less mindful of the mood of the music that he sings.One of the worst recordings that I've bought!"
5,New appreciation of Watson,"This is a terrific, energetic recording. Its high level of intensity in both the operatic arias and pop songs make it an album that cannot be topped for its wonderful variety and composition. The recording on the CD is superb. I've recently introduced it to several friends, all of whom begin to wonder who this singer is, and have later purchased copies! I love it. New appreciation yet for Watson!"
1,A comical turn,"Listening to this cd, I almost think that it is intended as a vocal joke. The singing, and also the interpretation, is farcical. Those who have any knowledge of good singing will certainly laugh at all those vocal blunders, and those who looks for any sense of style in the performance will surely giggle at the poker-faced delivery.I'll make a good party recording, I suppose. But I can only give it one star for musical merit or the lack of it."
1,Singer with little technique and imagination,"The music on this release is all quite demanding. It needs a very well-trained singer to perform them to satisfaction. Unfortunately, the music is here entrusted to the incapable hands (voice) of Russell Watson, who literally croaks his way through the music. Listen to any track any you'll discover dozens of instances where Watson is incapable to achieve or attain what the music demands.There's also little imagination in Watson's singing too. He usually can only sing with an all-purpose tone. His way of ending phrases with a half gasp is a most annoying mannerism.It is fortunate that my copy of the album is only a loan from a library. Having heard this much hyped recording at last, I can now have a clearer idea of what Russell Watson really represents."
5,Watson made us converts to Classical Music,"I was only a casual fan of classical vocal music until I saw and heard Russell Watson in his American debut at the Taj Majal in Atlantic City.My wife and I have since acquired the Voice and this album and have thoroughly been captivated by them both. I will have to say that I enjoy seeing Russell Watson live rather listening to his CD but seeing that his appearances in the US are limited, I have to resign myself to listening to his wonderful voice on the stereo."
5,Watson is perfect,"I give this album five stars because it is one of the few CD's I own that I can listen to forever and never get tired of. It is also an excellent artistic effort. The arrangements are perfect.....Watson is perfect.....To me, it is heartening to know that a new generation is being introduced to classical music through this wonderful singer. Without Watson, thousands of music lovers who otherwise would have ignored this off-limits music will now be able to enjoy all music. 5 Stars."
4,The Classics get a Jump Start,"A Solid Tenor + Energy + Classical Styling + Contemporary Flare = Russell Watson: ""ENCORE""Like Sarah Brightman, Russell Watson is taking classical music to the masses. No longer is classical music only being played in the closet, but it is now being played in the open; to sold out venues. A new energy is here and that new energy is Russell Watson.Russell Watson is a new style of tenor that merges the old ways of classical with the new energy's, and sometimes sounds, of today's more contemporary music. Watson may not be as dramatic as some of the great tenors, but who want just another classic song, sung the same old way. Watson breathes life into the old standards. He makes great use of his tenor voice by delivering strong vocals without losing the overall feel of the music being sung. His energy and interpretations make ""ENCORE"" a must have."
1,A tenor who cannot sing like a tenor,"People described Russell Watson as a tenor. However, I can't hear him singing like a tenor on this CD. He cannot reach the tenorish highs, and he hasn't the heroic voice of true tenors. In fact, I don't even think he is a classical singer at all, as judged from the weak sounds that he makes and the exceedingly poor support of his tone.It's a gross corruption of the word 'tenor' if one uses it to describe Russell Watson."
1,"Little passion, inadequate technique","What I heard here is a complete disappointment.First of all, Russell Watson isn't what he claims to be: He is neither an opera singer or a classical singer.Secondly, he has such a poor technique that makes him not suitable at all for the promotion of classical music to the masses. His technical inadequacies will only distort the music that he sings.Thirdly, he sings without passion at all. Listen to the truly great singers. Their singing is so full of emotion that one can be moved to tears. Russell Watson's singing, on the other hand, is cold and unwieldy.What a disappointment!"
1,Cannot be compared with Safina and Frangoulis,"What I heard in this recording is just substandard singing. Russell Watson can in no way be compared with genuine cross over artists like Safina and Frangoulis, which are blessed with better voices and have superior vocal skills. Watson doesn't even look as well as them!This recording represents poor value for money. Not recommended."
1,Neither a classical nor cross-over singer,"I don't think Russell Watson is a classical singer for his singing is distinctly non-classical in the sense that his projection is weak, the voice range narrow and that he is unable to execute the many details required by classical vocal music. In fact, that he needs to rely on the microphone when singing live already indicates that he's no classical singer.I don't think Russell Watson is a cross-over singer, too. To me, cross-over singers must possess a sense of charm and ease of delivery that is totally absent in Watson's singing. Instead, Watson's performances on this cd is dull and rigid.This is not an enjoyable cd."
5,A Remarkable Singer,I bought this CD because I saw Russell Watson perform a song from the Phantom of the Opera on a recent TV program. I couldn't believe all of the voices coming from this one singer and had to search everywhere for his CDs. I ended up buying Encore and just love this CD because of his incredible versatility and voices. I love his duets with Lulu and Richie. But my real amazement was listening to his operatic voice which was a surprise to me. This singer is astonishing!
5,Loved every song on this CD,"I just loved every song on this CD, especially the ""Is Nothing Sacred"" number. I go to sleep with it on every night!!Just listen to some samples and if you like it, you'll love it!Wonderful..."
5,CD grows on you,"Kudos to Mr. Watson whose amazing voices do not disappoint us in delivery or content. Lovely. I enjoy this work over and over, especially the song ""Where My Heart Will Take Me"". The more I hear this CD the more I love it.I have many, many CD's but I consider this the best. Listening to this touches my soul. This CD grows and grows on you. I highly recommend it to any music lover."
5,Watson's singing is top-notch,"I bought this album originally for Va, Pensiero, which is its highlight. However, I also enjoy the others. Watson's singing is top-notch on this album - equal to his VOICE album.The orchestrations are superb and each song is done perfectly. I am always amazed at the versatility of Watson and his voice. This is a singer to be watching for in the future."
1,Frightfully bad,"There can only be one kind of description for this recording: It's frightfully bad.It can be heard that this recording has been very hastily produced. Things certainly aren't very polished. The singing is particularly bad, which the singer, Russell Watson, grooping for notes in an embarrassing manner.Not recommended."
1,Substandard,The singing of Russell Watson on this cd is substandard. He fails both the technical and interpretative challenges. I don't find this cd to be at all enjoyable. Just a waste of money.
1,Beware of all the hype,"All those hype surrounding Russell Watson can be very misleading. From what I can hear on this cd, the singer has little voice and there's nothing beautiful about the quality of the voice too. The singing is consistently disappointing."
5,Wonderful mix of opera and pop,"From ""Va, pensiero"" to ""I Just Don't Know How I Got By"" to ""Celeste Aida"", this is Watson at his best. I am only 29 years old and I love this cd.A Must have for any music fan. This is the Cd I have been waiting for. A mix of operatic arias and pop songs sung by a wonderful classical tenor voice and, better still, pop sungs sung by a terrific and real pop voice."
5,"Different, but excellent CD","This album is a bit of a change for Russell. It is more up-tempo than recent albums and has more pop tracks than his first album. His classical voice is ever-improving and his pop voices keep changing with each song. I generally listen to more classical and opera than pop music, but have been a fan of Russell when he first came on the music scene. I feel that this is an exceptional album, well conceived and well executed with the help of a great talent. He's always a risk taker and takes chances with new versions of old melodies and I hope it pays off for him."
5,"Great talent, Great voice","I must admit that I had my doubts about this one. To release a second album so soon after his successful VOICE album requires a lot of confidence, talent or just plain guts.In this case, its all three. Russell Watson did a marvelous job. He has always been much more of a professional musician than the mostly hostile media gave him credit for. Without talent or guts to break new ground, his albums would not be selling as they are now. He has proven his artistry beyond doubt.I would have preferred more classical musical selections that might have better shown off Russell's classical tenor voice, but all in all this is one very good album. He never ceases to amaze me with all the new voices he comes up with each album. Great talent, great voice!"
1,Not up to the task,"Russell Watson is totally not up to the task in this recording project. Neither his voice or his technique is capable of giving a respectable rendition of the music, much of it is simply beyond his abilities.I think it would be more responsible of Mr Watson if he can take some classes in singing before rushing out another badly performed recording."
1,Laughable singing,"The singing on this cd is often unintentionally ludicrous. Russell Watson doesn't have the voice for much of the songs here, and his clumsy delivery creates a lot of vocal howlers.A record only for those who have the humor to laugh at bad singing."
1,Shouldn't have encored,"Given the bad performances of Russell Watson in his debut cd, and that his vocal skills have not improved at all, he shouldn't have given this ""encore"", which again presents the inadequacies of Watson's singing. I can hardly find a song here that is competently performed.One star."
1,Wrong voice for such music,"Russell Watson does not have the right type of voice for most of the music that he sings here. As a result, his singing is effortful and unidiomatic. Unpleasant to listen to. I'm sure there're millions in this world who can sing better than Watson. Anyway, just forget this 3-day wonder."
1,Gives no pleasure,This album is really bad. Gives no pleasure to me whatsoever. The singing is atrocious. No feeling in the performance. Acoustics is ghastly. Totally unsatisfactory!
1,Disappointing,"This album is most disappointing. The singer, a newcomer named Russell Watson, has an appalling vocal technique and is apparantly completely ignorant of different musical styles. As a result, his singing is technically fault-ridden, musically uninteresting, stylistically incorrect and emotionally bland.I don't think I've ever encountered such bad singing before on records."
1,A vocal disaster,"Can't imagine why Decca can produce and release this kind of recording. It's a veritable vocal disaster!Russell Watson's singing skills can be put to shame by an ordinary choir boy in many high schools. His voice is small, and his range is narrow. He's neither musical nor stylish, and his performances are strangely uncommunicative.In reality, he suffered lots of vocal mishaps throughout this recording, which can make one cringe or mad, depending one what perspective one is looking at it.This is a recording which doesn't not deserve to be released to the public."
1,A complete failure,"I consider this recording to be a complete failure. Russell Watson simply fails to do any justice to the music. It's ironic that he and his record company are promoting Watson as a versatile singer. The fact, as can obviously be heard from this recording, is that Watson does everything badly. Surely not a mark of versatility!"
1,Worst CD I've ever purchased,"This is by far the worst CD I've ever purchased. I really don't know how to describe it, but, to put it simply, the singing is extremely bad. It's obviously the work of a complete amateur who has little skill and talent in singing. The choice of program is also beyond the singer's abilities.I am surprised that some people seem to like this recording (or many it's just the same 2 or 3 person who keeps on writing those unconvincing 5 star reviews here). But speaking for myself, I consider it a shame that any recording company cares to release to the public a recording of such low quality."
1,Watson isn't of Groban's class,"Russell Watson is definitely not in the class of Groban, who sings with great charm and skill. By contrast, Watson merely belts out the music without emotion. It's just like listening to a person shouting at you at close distance.Horrible recording!"
1,Not enjoyable,"This album is not enjoyable at all, at least to me and my friends. We're pop music lovers and, after reading some articles on Russell Watson, who claims that he can bring people like myself to classical music, we decided to give it a try. However, we can only say that we hate classical music even more after listening to such incompetent singing by Russell Watson. Hope not all classical singers are that bad in technique and over-bearing in sound. S"
2,"I was one, and it wasn't like that","I don't 'get' why so many people think so highly of this book. I was one of the M&A; folks at Cisco, doing mostly A. It wasn't so structured, nor so successful, nor so wonderful. We just did the best we can -- each deal is different.Nice to have the name, the money, market share, etc. Made it much easier to get an acceptable deal. If I were on the other side of the table, life would have been less nice.The author's uncritical look at the Cisco way makes me suspect that (a) he just didn't know or (b) he was paid off."
2,disappointing,"I had big hopes based on the interviews a read about this book, but at the end of the day, it was really disappointing.No real insights. Basically, a collection of standard methodologies and know how that most people (even with very little exposure to M&As;) already know.There are some interesting stuff, but don't expect much.And the constant ""cheerleading"", with not a single critical view, does not help to add value."
2,"Eh, so-so and of course no more the same.","I live and breathe Cisco, and I must say that this book is accurate perhaps if you think of the Cisco some 8 to 10 years ago, when it was still a very young start-up, thriving and shaking things up like no other company. It is an ok read. I did not enjoy it as much as I wished. Perhaps reality is a harsh pill to swallow."
1,Thoroughly disappointed,"I have seen many craft magazines come and go. I hope this one goes. Granted, there is no commercial advertising in it, but paying anything over $1.98 per issue would be too much. The crafts are mainly useless, juvenile, and lack polish. I purchased my subscription sight unseen because it was through supporting a local school (the only saving grace to this whole experience), but that is a mistake I will not make again. It took at least three months after ordering it that I finally received my first issue. I opened it with great expectation of finding original and practical crafts for my home, but was immediately thoroughly disappointed. Thankfully, my subscription will be expiring soon.If you are a serious crafter, I recommend passing by this one."
3,Rock n Roll 4-Ever,You want some of the good first of its kind rock music.Then here you go one from the start.
4,Laughing Out Loud,"While reading the Gifts of Jimmy V, I found myself laughing out loud while imagining the plots told by his brothers, coaches, and friends. Although I was too young to remember the Championship win at NC State, I do recall his ESPN days. I always thought he was a nut, and thought it was a shame that cancer took him away in such a tragic way. The book was great, and if you are like me and don't have time to read novels, it's a good short book that gives you a different look at life and how you should live it."
2,Could be better.,"I was impressed with all the pieces, & liked the pots with short handles. But, when washing the lids, the handles on top get full of waterand have to be sat up for water to drain out... s l o w l e y, before putting them away. Also the metal on the handles has a tendency to get very warm when you're cooking. But, what do you want for 30 bucks?"
2,marvelous cookware set,I love the cookware set. 12 pans to do 12 different meals. They are very durable and holds up well to the heat.
5,Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla,I use this product in all my baking and many recipes for special occasions. It has it's own distinct flavor. I will never use regular vanilla again since I discovered this product.
4,Not bad for a first effort,Very frugal budget. Interesting concept of random strangers who meet in a chat room and plan a group suicide. I liked the plot twist when it was discovered that one of the members of the group had a very different agenda. It was obvious early on that one can be whoever one wants to be in cyberspace. I suspect the original screenplay did a much better job of character development - which suffered on the editing room floor.
4,Intriguing,"If you're looking for pure ""horror,"" you're not going to find it here. That said, it was a very unique story that was full of unexpected twists and turns and had its share of the necessary fright moments.I'd say it was as much of a comedy as it was horror if that makes sense. It had sort of a ""Lost"" kind of feel to it in a lot of ways.This film was unique for its sort of campy (at times) take on a grim subject (group suicide) plus its characters, whom you kind of fall in love with despite their obvious flaws.Overall, I thought it did a good job keeping you guessing what would happen next and you actually cared whether the characters lived or died -- which is different from a lot of movies in this genre where the characters are little more than fuel to drive the plot.I rented it last night and was going to buy a copy, but the price point seems a little high for an indie film DVD."
3,The turn of a friendly card - if you can hang around for the end,"People meet over a chat line. This is not very unique as people will do that. However this group forms a suicide pack lead by a mysterious chatterer named Dwarf Star.They meet one at a time at a creepy old barn in the middle of nowhere, waiting for Dwarf Star to arrive. Things begin to happen as we hear creepy background music and each character start to unfold this/her secrets.Immediately we think of classic stories like ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari""; there are cheesy flash backs or forwards or sideward to support the theme that this is a dream. Please do not make it a cheap knockoff of ""The Eye"" or some other cheep ghost story. Tell me it is a psychological thriller or something less sinister.The Cabinet of Dr. CaligariThe Eye"
2,Shun and Wustoff user,"Purchased the Kyocera Revolution 7"" ceramic knife because of the general hype about them. I currently use Shun and Wustoff knives that I have had for years. I think my Shun and Wustoff knives are far sharper than the Kyocera. Even when cutting a shallot I find there is more effort used with the ceramic knife than the Shun or the Wustoff. Although it does do a good job with tomatoes and vegetables. Meat and fish are pretty much the same as a metal knife.If I had to choose one knife to do all jobs,..it would be a non-ceramic knife and I would wash, hone and store immediately.If I could I would return the Kyocera."
5,Fabulous knife!,"A dull knife is the most dangerous tool in the kitchen. I've always owned very good knives -- including Henckels (not the ones made in China), Wustof, Shun, etc. -- and have always sharpened my own knives with steels and with my Chef's Choice electric sharpeners. But these ceramic knives by Kyocera truly are great because they don't need sharpening and are extremely sharp. I can pull these knives out each time and know they are ready for use. I make my own gravlax and am impressed with the paper-thin slices of the raw fish that I can get from using the ceramic knives."
4,Very sharp but.................,These knives are extremely sharp and seem to hold an edge but the blade is thicker than steel and consequently the blade tends to get stuck in food that doesn't just fall away. Other than that these knives are great. They slice a ripe tomato without crushing and raw meat with ease. I use these knives as often as I can.
4,great knife,My husband loves the knife. It slices everything like it's butter. My negatives are that it doesn't come with a protective sleeve. These knives can chip like glass and a sleeve would have been helpful. And the price is rather high.
2,"Fragile, chipped 2nd time used","The second time we used this knife, it deflected off of an unseen fish bone and chipped. Perhaps we're just too heavy handed for this type of knife. But because of its fragility, we'll be sticking with steel from now on."
3,????????Y,"Yes, I ordered the black Kyocera knife. Two different times I was shipped WHITE one's .So I still do not have the BLACK knife that I ordered a month ago!"
5,A ceramic knife?,"Kyocera Revolution Series 7 Inch Professional Chef's Knife, Black BladeMy oldest son's wife told me that he wanted a ceramic knife for Christmas. I had never heard of such a thing. I found it on Google & purchased it on Amazon.com.It's supposed to be sharper and longer lasting than a metal knife. Who would have thunk it?My son was very pleased with the knife and used it to carve the holiday turkey."
4,REALLY SHARP,"A VERY SHARP KNIFE THAT MAKES SLICING AND DICING EASY AND FUN AS LONG AS YOU KEEP YOUR FINGERS OUT OF THE WAY! I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE KNIFE COME WITH A PROTECTIVE COVER AS YOU NEED SOME WAY TO PROTECT THE KNIFE EDGE TO HELP ASSURE THAT IT DOES NOT GET DAMAGED. THERE IS ALSO A SAFETY CONCERN WHEN THE BLADE IS EXPOSED. A SIMPLE PLASTIC SHEATH WOULD SUFFICE. THE KNIFE IS LIGHT, EASY TO HANDLE, AND FITS MY HAND WELL. I WOULD GIVE THIS KNIFE A 5 STAR RATING IF THE BLADE COULD BE PROTECTED IN A SECURE MANNER."
4,"Good Knife, not great!","I recently purchased this knife on the suggestions of several friends who fancy themselves chefs. I found the knife as advertised, very sharp and good looking. However, its lack of feel/heft (it is very light) was disconcerting and inhibited rather than accelerated my work of cutting and slicing. In short, it feels like a cheap knife, not very different from the $10-15 imitations you can find everywhere."
5,Crazy good!,"Wow! This knife is the sharpest thing I've ever seen! I have a set of Wustoff knives, and a Kyocera ceramic knife- this knife is every bit as sharp as the Kyocera, and that is really saying something. Plus, I can use it on things that the ceramic knife could not handle, such as meats. I highly recommend this knife to anyone looking to get the highest quality available in a non-ceramic knife. Love the angle on the handle too...it won't work in a flat knife block, but you can find a knife holder at World Market called a ""Swoosh"" block that works great for this knife. Do NOT put it loose in a drawer with other knives if you value your skin...I cut my thumb just getting this out of the box when it arrived and didn't realize I was bleeding until I put it back in the box."
5,Sharper than regular knives....but WATCH out ... it could ... chip,"So, when my father wanted a ceramic knife for Christmas, my sister bought him the Kitchenaid brand from Target; with in the week it broke. So when he wanted a replacement, I was skeptical about buying another one. We searched and compared then finally came up with this one. After a week of using this knife, I was pleasantly surprised and my father was a happy person again. It didn't chip or break in half (like the other one) and his faith in ceramic knives was restored.Please note, if you have never used one of these knives before, there are cutting restrictions mentioned by the manufacturer. Read over those and these:-do not cut : frozen items (father cut frozen cheese, knife broke in half), bones, or very hard cartilage.-great knife for: fresh bread, veggies, and thawed meats."
4,wife loves the knife,"The new Kyocera chef's knife s a joy to use for straightforward cutting. Meat,vegetables & fruit simply flow from the blade."
5,Great knife,I recommend this to anyone who wants a really sharp knife that is weighted perfectly. Received a paring knife as a gift from same manufacturer and was not disappointed and even more pleased with this size
4,good for vegetables,I use this in my home kitchen only. It slices veggies quite well and is balanced fairly well. I would not use it for meat or cheeses etc. as ceramic knives are known for their brittle nature.I am a professional cook and really can't find any major flaws.This knife is very sharp (not as sharp as my professional knives) and I really enjoy using it.
4,Incredibly sharp but..,"Kyocera ceramic knives are a work of genius but very different from steel. They are unbelievably sharp and hold their edge for many months of daily use. You should know however that there are two significant drawbacks. When the knives finally become dull, you cannot sharpen them yourself but must send them to factory service in Los Angeles. The Kyocera people return them quickly, and in fact will sometimes replace broken items with brand new ones free of charge without being asked, but of course it is still inconvenient. Second, the ceramic is brittle and fragile so the edge chips easily. If you try to pry with it, it will break right off.Overall it is more practical for everyday to use quality steel knives you can sharpen easily yourself. I do recommend having one or two ceramic knives in your collection for items like tomatoes."
4,"Cuts Smooth Like Butter, But Is Very Fragile!","This knife slices smoothly through about everything I've used it on (not sweet potatoes though, those suckers are dense). It's very lightweight, so easy to feel each cut you make. I didn't give it 5 stars because the handle feels too small (I'm a woman with average-size hands) and because it's SO fragile. This knife has to be washed, dried and stored with the most delicate awareness. I invested another $20 in a sheath to protect it in the drawer and handwash and dry it, but am still concerned that it won't last another few months without inevitably chipping on me. Even with those drawbacks, I'd buy it again."
5,Kyocera 7 inch ceramic knife,"ExTremely sharp and well balanced. A wonderful utility knife in the kitchen, especially for fine cutting(thin)."
3,adequate knife,Knife is adequate. I don't see anything that would make me buy another knife like this. My steel knives are just as sharp and have more weight for easier cutting... and I can resharpen them myself.
3,Too fragile,"I broke two before giving up and switching to Forschner, which I like better. Kyocera is no sharper than quality steel. The brochure mentions shaving with it. That's advertising hype. It is not sharp as a razor."
5,fantastic sound,this system sounds great. i was worried when i got it because the speakers are small and lightweight but they pack a huge punch and the subwoffer is great also. worth the price. dvd's sound like they should and i really like playing playstation in surround sound it makes video games come alive. money well spent.
2,Not for everyone,"Written for former frat boys and sorority girls in Beantown who still live in the ""pack"" and can't think outside of it. The ads for kids jewelry and diamond encrusted false eyelashes are vomit inducing. A must for the pretentious set who need a glossy mag to find their second home and the latest places to be seen. Interesting anthropological study for the rest of us."
4,Excellent Articles,"This magazine was full of interesting articles about Boston, specifically arts related ones. I just wish it also included events listings."
2,got it for my parents...,"...and although it was a creative house warming gift, I am not impressed. If you are intrested in knowing what is going on with the lawyers or the fanciest chef's in the Boston area and where to locate these people, this magazine might satisfy you. I got a subscription for my parents when they moved to the Boston area about a year ago and, although they might give it a nicer review since they did RENEW their subscription, being an out-of-towner I am not at all impressed. The magazine seems to be promoting the idea that everyone in Boston is loaded and lives the glamorous life and while I understand that the cost of living int he area is quite high, I do not believe nor have I experienced the image promoted in the magazine to be accurate of the area. In visiting my parents I have tried many times to pick up the magazine and read it to no avail..."
5,outstanding,This album is outstanding. Zucchero is a true find in exciting popular music. I can't keep his albums for myself...everyone wants them.
3,British invasion goodies,For 23.98 you get a number of songs not available at Apple Music. Which is cheaper than buying Small Faces and Manfred Mann' albums. And you still get Freddie and the Dreamers and numerous other one hit wonders. Good value if you are looking for British invasion oldies.
4,Steampunk - with knights,"Fun steampunk novel - postapocalyptic and medieval, the world as told by a retired military engineer and edited by a mainstream historian approximately a hundred years later. The book follows a fun storyline from the academy through an interesting war. The book fails on the clarity of the technology - especially when describing the vastly improved aircraft, it wasn't clear how the planes had such a greater range and speed. Small details sometimes irk the reader, especially when Judson gets lazy with his language, falling into cliches. But the book is fun, fast and cool - a little oversentimental, but a fun ride through a wild future with interesting settings and warfare technologies."
5,Lucky Find,"I actually picked this one up by accident - i was looking for space opera and thought this was, considering it takes place in the 25th century. Unfortunatly i failed to find what i was looking for. Fortunatly what i found was this.I was going to say something long and informative, i doubt i'd do it justice. I'll say one thing: it's beautifully written. The air of an annotated memoir is so well done that, sometimes, after reading it for a few hours you might look up from the pages and be mildly surprised to find yourself not in a Yukon homestead.Awesome book."
2,Unbelievable!,"If you are going to develop a post-(I'm not sure what) alternative history 400 years in the future, then try to come up with a technology that works. This is a very predictable read.I found myself knowing what was coming, but it took another couple of pages to get there.Plus this book has footnotes! Footnotes are for non-fiction books (I know we've seen a spate of these foot noted tomes of late), but they detract from the story telling.Save yourself the trouble and try a different book."
2,disappointing,"The book has a very interesting premise for a post-apocolyptic world. That's where the good parts of the book end. It's written in a quasi biographical style with endless footnotes to other ""books"" of the period. This style was old by the end of the first chapter. There are better ways to include background information in my opinion. The other problem is all the political underpinnings in the writing. If I want politics, I'll read the paper or watch the news. I would love to see him rewrite it as an actual fiction book instead of a fictional biographical political commentary."
5,"Beautiful Borders, Backings, and Bindings",We own several books on this subject but this one is the best of all.
5,Almost perfect collection,"I was a little surprised at some of the selections (even more so at the absentees of later years), but the previously unreleased material makes this worth any price to a true fan. ""Why should I feel blue"", ""Borderstone"", and ""Never Say Trust Me"" capture Lightfoot's style perfectly; I'd buy the whole set again just for tracks like these. There was a noticible absence of work from the 90's, though it's nice to see significant contributions from ""Shadows"", ""Salute"", and ""East of Midnight"". It was nice to hear ""Remeber Me"" again, too (although it debuted approx. 20 years before I was born). Well worth any price!-Andrew"
5,Pleasant Surprises,"For Gordon Lightfoot fans, this CD boxset is a gotta have. For people who want to get to know the man and his music, it's a should have. Of course his old standards are still wonderful to listen to over and over. Most of what you like of his work can be found in this boxset. But what surprised me most was the number of outstanding previously unpublished songs found sprinkled around the 4-disk set. Why these songs never were published is a mystery! Some of these are wonderful acoustic recordings done in the 80's which are what I consider vintage Lightfoot. In particular, ""Why Should I Feel Blue""' ""Never Say Trust Me"", and ""Always on the Bright Side"" found on disc 4 are exceptional and are the types of songs I felt were missing from his albums in the 80s. Overall the boxset is well produced with excellent sound quality and even includes a book outlining Gordon's career and documenting the CD set."
2,Maybe it's just me,"I liked the Lightfoot stuff on United Artists. I LOVED the stuff on Warner Brothers. My problem with this set is that after Lightfoot settled on a recording group for several 70s albums in a row, they re-recorded some of the earlier songs, like ""Bittergreen,"" with fuller instrumentation and better production. The songs here are great. They're just not the versions I have come to love. Better to splurge for a couple of volumes of ""Gord's Gold,"" and a few LPs like ""Summer Side of Life,"" and get the songs as Lightfoot finally and fully realized them. I bought this box set and was bitterly disappointed. His mature versions of the same songs are infinitely more moving.Gord's GoldSummer Side of LifeGord's Gold, Vol. 2"
2,Sadly lacking much romance,"I've loved Virginia Henley's books in the past and have been a fan for many years, but her latest offering is lackluster and both the heroine and hero left me cold. I thought both were extremely pigheaded, selfish and unreasonable people and I didn't care what happened to them at all. They are at loggerheads and separated for most of the book which left me wondering what genre I was reading. Hopefully Miss Henley will regain her golden touch with her next book."
3,Not impressed,"I used to love Virginia Henley's books especially the dragon and the jewel and the other ""and the"" stories. I am disappointed in this one. I thought the writing was not that good and the characters were silly. The heroine was a brat and not at all likable. The hero was a fool and the story was very predictable. Hopefully, her other newer books are better."
3,Formulaic and boring,"The usual - young girl wants to be free to live her own life. Along comes older/handsome man who wants her. They flirt/fight and eventually get together. Set during the Restoration it offers little of history. And what it does offer is sometimes inaccurate. Such as placing the royal court of France at Versailles when the palace was not built until years later. Ms. Henley needs to go back to her wonderful books such as ""The Dragon and the Jewel"" where the characters were well developed and the story was interesting."
2,UNMASKED,"I READ KINDLE BOOKS TO ESCAPE THE GRIM ROUTINE OF LIFE. WHY SPOIL IT?SPOILER ALERT:I DON'T BUY A BOOK TO ESCAPE REALITY, TO HAVE THE HEROINE BADLY SCARRED BY SMALLPOX TOWARD THE END. A PERFECT BOOK FOR ME WAS UTTERLY SPOILED BY THIS ENDING."
2,Was I Reading The Pirate and the Pagan?,This book was a big disappointment. The encounters between the main characters was almost identical to the Pirate and the Pagan...except the P&P; was much better.Why do these authors get away with recycling their material? How do they look themselves in the mirror?
1,Don't bother,"I've read every one of V. Henleys books and this is the most boring yet. I started skipping pages at around page 75 then gave up at 100 and read the last chapter....sigh. Give me her books from the 80's anyday, much more intelligently written."
2,Good sound cheap product,"long story short...I bought this for US$400 (almost) and after a year is broken. I just put it in the stand and use every now and then, funny thing is that since works with Phantom power is really hard to find some with the necessary equipment to fix it and tested (they gotta have Phantom Power unit, not many electricians have one)Good sound tho...but I expected this to last a little longer."
3,Good,"This book has a lot of great information and facts, it is easy to read. It would be better if it had some pictures or graphics to help describe some information."
4,Book Review,I purchased this book for a class I was taking and it is a great reference and informational book for anyone who needs help on how to create good teams and team building processes. It has been a big help for my Group Dynamics and Team Building class.
5,Thank you!,The book came very quickly (within three days of ordering it) and was in great condition. I will absolutely order from Amazon again
2,Exspencieve,I was looking for an unabridged book/ I ended up ordering the $30 something which wach was not listed as abridged. Recieved the book which was an uncensered Abridgement.\If it had been listed that way I would have just ordered a copy that was listed as about half the price. Not happy with this outcome.
2,"Loathsome, interminable wallow into human depravity","In 1957, early morning in the US civil rights era, plopped this bestselling, 800 page-plus ode to black slavery - think ""Gone With the Wind"" on Spanish Fly. A hateful attempt to justify racial stereotypes via bogus sympathy for its black characters, and equally bogus historical detail. The author displays a rudimentary sense of pot-boiler plot (literally, as it happens), all to the most sadistic end. Bonus star awarded for its status as one of the unmentionable lowlights of 50's pop culture. After all, its title did coin a term - expropriated from the name of an African tribe - that still offends. That's the power of exploitation fiction, for you."
3,Fingerpicking Guitar,Good book in that author exposes various styles to the new student. That is also the weakness of the book. Going from style to style with short lessons tends to confuse the student new to guitar fingerpicking.
4,"For beginners, who try self-teaching","This book is most suitable for those who would like to make your guitar sound more authentically in short period of time, especially on their own. Not so deep studies in particular style are made in this book that it covers various types of technques, intensely about arpeggios. Even for beginners, it is fairy possible to be able to play beautiful Greensleeves, depending on the effective use for the CD attached in the book. I recommend this book as one of the best self-teaching style book which I have ever seen."
5,False Advertising,"I'm a huge fan of most cartoons that come from the 80's. There is only one thing i found wrong with this DVD Set. It's called Captain N The Game Master - The Complete Series, but its not the whole series, a few yrs after this was realeased they released Captain N and the New Super Mario World, if you read one of the reviews it says ""It's the last 7 eps of Captain N: The game master"" so unless the re-released 7 episodes, the complete series dvd set is not complete."
5,Great,"I also gave thiiss to my son for christmas, this iss another series he remembers watching back when he was younger."
3,finally my favorite show on DVD!,I have been waiting for this to come out My tapes are really worn.I know it's nice to have these but the copyrighted songs were taken out like Thriller and other favorites replaced with an annoying instrumental song that plays through every episode. I wish they had a way to take out the music so you won't hear that same song through every episode.another thing I'm tired of is the extras. i don't want to see pics of backgrounds used for the show Like the Super Mario set How about sketches of the characters or even bios would be nice cause looking at backgrounds is boring!
3,Replacement Program for disc 3 coming soon,"as some of you are aware disc 3 of the set on episode queen of the apes is missing about 3 min of footage , i recently sent a e-mail to shout factory to let them know of the flaw and i got the following e-mail back :Hi Jason,You are right, there was an error. We are in the process of correcting the problem. Once everything gets worked out we are going to make arrangements to manufacture the corrected disc, and give them out free to everyone that bought the box set. This process will take about a month though, so the best thing to do is to hold on to your set and check back with us in a month or so. We apologize for the incontinence.so within a month you can send the disc in for a replacement"
1,one of the worst,"I love movies and have collected 100's of movies,some that we love,some that are enjoyable,for one night only.I have a list oftrue bombs,Coming and Going is at the top.It is amazing that anyone would put money into a script that has absolutely no redeemingvalue.A truly painful experiece."
4,Another Great Tale from Edgar Wallace,"I rate this story four stars. Very original, somewhat speculative, and unlike most stories of the time driven mostly by action and not dialog or the omniscient observations of the author. I'm not sure exactly how to place this story, it has a higher body count than most stories of the era, and its rather minimalist romance angle could be dispensed with altogether and the story would still be pretty good. As usual Wallace is a little over the top in his story telling, the hero is a detective with a flair for the dramatic, and there are several minor characters that clog up the tale with subplots that lead to some twists and turns. Some mystery within a mystery sort of twists to the plot, but, overall an enjoyable read. If you are in the mood for something completely different, this might just be the thing you are looking for."
4,The Secret House,I enjoyed reading this book. It was very suspenseful and held your attention all through the book. I would recommend this book.
1,not happy with this product,"I own this coffeemaker and initially I was very happy with the design. I love the lack of caraffe and unsightly burner plate. However, within 5 months of purchase the unit began a slow leak at the spigot valve which progressed to a major leak rendering the unit unuseable. The two included extra valve seals should be a red flag to consumers of this product indicating that Hamilton Beach knows about the problem and it's serious enough to justify including extra seals with the product. By the way, replacing the leaking seal in my unit with a new seal did not fix the problem. In fact it became worse. Hamilton Beach is sending me a new tank which I'm still waiting on. I anticipate that this one, if it is the same design, will also eventually leak. By that time, it will be out of warranty and no longer a problem for the manufacturer."
2,Deflated in 2 days,"I bought this for my little kids to play with out on our lanai, but it lasted 2 days and then i guess either popped or deflated, either way it wasn't a very good toy, however for the $5 sale price, I can't complain, I guess they got 2 days out of play with it."
2,Mediocre at best,"This is a mediocre cash box. The dollar clips like to pop out at inconvenient times. Although it is not difficult to put them back in, when your trying to exchange monies this can get annoying. Also the carrying handle is centered on the top of the box, which is fine when empty, but when change is in it the balance is off. The change falls causing added aggravation."
2,Interesting but Exhausting!,"What can I say.. I did enjoy this book. But after reading all the other reviews on it I must agree, it gets kind of old when all she does is talk about how great she is. But I found the book interesting with all the info Jimmy Page, Iggy Pop, Mick Jagger, etc. The book also had a lot of great pictures. I would recommend it, overall it was good."
1,Poor Bebe,"What a pathetic piece of flotsam. Never ""anyone"" but chose to sleep with ""everyone"", boy or girl, no difference - if she thought that they could help her ""career"" - such as that was. ""Was"" may be too kind of an interpretation. A zero of a ""model"" who chose to hook her wagon, or legs, around anyone holding a guitar. This is a fun read just for its prurient nature, but her whole ""poor me, I'm so talented BS"" is shameful. She was marginally recognized for the men with whom she slept - nothing more. Liv, I'm glad that you rose above your upbringing - lucky for you your ""mother"" had very little to do with it."
2,Boring....,"I found it hard to believe that someone with such an opportunity for a can't-put-down book managed to be pretty boring. I was looking forward to this book because I was sure I would like it. Sex, drugs, rock & roll - what more can you add? How about a little personality?I wouldn't recommend this groupie book but if you want a good one, pick up I'm With the Band by Pamela Des Barres. It's a lot more entertaining."
2,Mostly Boring Arrogant Fluff,"I can't say I expected much of this book and I was not disappointed. The editing is non-existent. It's hard to believe that BB actually has any recollection of many of the encounters she relates since she can't remember what she said the page before. While at first it was almost fun to dog ear pages where there were contradictions and poor English usage, after a while it became highly annoying. What did she pay her ghost writer to do anyway?Her arrogance - deserved or not - takes away most of what make this book an interesting light read. There are parts in the book, mostly early on, where she is more self depreciating and those parts quickly passed as good entertainment. Unfortunately her attitude inexplicably changes to something less endearing as she is literally passed down the ladder of the rock hierarchy to a point where she is groupie to nobodies and she feels it necessary to try to validate herself. A pity indeed.You've been forewarned."
3,A little less conceit,"Overall I was pleased with the book. However, I was perplexed by why Bebe felt she had to inandate the reader with how beautiful she felt she was over and over again throughout the book. She even started a paragraph with ""Because I was beautiful"".I enjoyed reading about the world she lived in, the seventies rock scene, which I have always found interesting. Even that got tainted with her grandois impressions of herself as a ""taste maker"". I mean to think you can spot talent better than the great Clive Davis is not only ridiculous, but embarrasing.I do find it interesting how all the rockers seemed to love her and her company so much i.e. Mick Jagger, Jimmy Page, Keith Richards and Ron Wood, however, they all went off and married other women. Leaving Bebe in the dust.Once again I did enjoy the book and how it moved quickly, without lingering on one subject to long, however, I could have done without the conceit and thinking every song was written about you."
2,Okay,"From what I'd read beforehand I was expecting ""Rebel Heart"" to be the type of book that I'd either love or hate. Unfortunately it invoked neither love nor hate in me once I'd finished the last page. I didn't feel a thing. I read it with an open mind. The flaw of ""Rebel Heart"" is that it comes across as an exercise in self-promotion. I was constantly reminded that the author, Bebe Buell, thinks of herself as jaw-droppingly gorgeous. Whether she is or she isn't - this started to grate on me after a chapter or two. Bebe Buell also considers herself as muse, not a groupie mind, to a number of rock stars. But of course what she has always wanted to be is a rock star herself, which she would have been, had people been able to see beyond the fact that she's jaw droppingly gorgeous. The reason I read ""Rebel Heart"" was for research on Bebe's daughter Liv Tyler for a website. There was enough background for that purpose. However, once I put the book down it disappeared from my memory soon after."
4,"""Rebel Heart"" is a real trip!!!","This book is not light and airy. But it is still fun, in some parts. I worried a bit about the subject and if she would actually make it through all the peaks and valleys, broken relationships and hard times. At least there are the fantastic stories about hanging out with the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin but the parts about Bebe's failed/doomed relationships were just heartbreaking. I cried my eyes out. It is not easy to write a book that can effect someone like that. It was a releif to see her happy in the end, enjoying a good relationship with her daughter, the actress Liv Tyler, still rockin' onstage and in a good solid love relationship. And she still looks great.I look forward to her next book and a time when she gets the respects she so deserves. Hey, and she's from Virginia."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"When I finished reading this book, I actually felt sorry for Bebe Buell. Her ego is so large and she is so deluded that she has no concept of reality. She claims to be independent while begging for money from Todd Rundgren and Steven Tyler and she calls herself a good mother while her daughter is being raised by her grandmother. She's a used-up groupie. I was not impressed."
1,Get it from the library,"I honestly don't know what to say about this book. Bebe Buell has lived a life that many would be envious of, or would at least find entertaining. However, in her book you wind up feeling sorry for her, as she relives a past full of disillusionment, sex, and rock and roll. There is an interesting story in here somewhere. However, it is poorly written, constructed, and edited in this book.I have no doubt Bebe would be fun to talk to, and has some good stories to tell. However, she should have picked an assistant writer who would have reined her ego in and let the story out. I was extremely disappointed to read a book that I had so looked forward to reading."
4,Got Rebel Heart for Christmas!!,"I finally got this book and both copies too. The original hardcover and the reissue paperback. It took me two days to read and I LOVED it. All of it! There are so many stories and so many photos. The photos are so great. Bebe Buell is a stunning woman. I see her on VH1 and E Entertainment all the time these days. All I've got to say is I was not at all let down by the book or how it was written or the content. I was pleasantly surprised how sweet and candid Bebe is. She loves herself too, lol. Nothing wrong with that! This is one book that will be talked about for years and years to come. I await the follow up to her story and hearing about her life now. I'm sure it is as exciting as it was in Rebel Heart and if not it will surely be as interesting. I would tell anyone to get this book."
4,Candid and Upbeat!,"I read Bebe Buell's new book ""Rebel Heart"" and was very impressed by how candid yet upbeat the book was. Bebe goes into detail about the good times and the bad times. With the good times we can only wish we were in her her shoes and with the bad times she does not ask for our pity. She simply explains the mistakes she has made. It was hard to take a break from reading the book because of how interesting all the stories were. The book is filled with charm, sadness, humor and candor that make a good book. I am very impressed."
1,heartlessly boring rip-off,"Bebe Buell wrote a book about being a groupie like Doris Day would write a book about having sex with Rock Hudson. She says nothing of interest...unless you're buying her book in order to learn all about how she keeps herself not looking her age through not smoking, drinking, taking drugs, or over eating."
2,painful,"i read this book with very mixed feelings. while i enjoyed some of the stories bebe buell had to tell from the glory days of rock n' roll, i couldn't get past her obsessive need to try to convince the world that she was/is fabulous, wonderful, gifted, beautiful, talented, etc. and her constant justification of how she raised (or didn't raise) her daughter.And some of the her claims that she inspired half of the songs created during the 70s and 80s are laughable. Particularly her claim that Prince wrote ""little red corvette"" about her. they had never met each other!The intriguing rock and roll stories here are just too few and far between, getting lost somewhere between her ego and her guilt."
2,Forced March,"If, like me, your boyfriend is a huge Todd Rundgren fan, you're not going to be able to skim this book and look at the pictures because he's going to want to discuss it in detail. So be warned.Bebe's story is interesting and I understood everything she was trying to say about herself. It's the writing that's so bad. Concepts such as topic sentences, the rules of grammar, and editing are no where to be found in the pages of this book. It's not good enough to tell a good story - you have to tell a good story well. The errors and inconsistencies were a complete distraction and made the experience painful and tedious.I wish Bebe well and I hope she has all the success in the world. I just hope she doesn't have any more literary ambitions to inflict on us."
1,self-deluded,"I have never read anything written by someone as deluded as Bebe. While I am interested in the people she talks about I cannot believe anything she says. Her vanity is unbelieveable! The world should be kneeling at her feet. And I cannot believe she put her ""lyrics"" at the top of every chapter. Reads like something written by a third grader. Sorry, I couldn't finish it."
1,Advice: Get this from the library!!!,"If you are at all interested in this book, please see if you can find it at your local library. That's what I did, and let me tell you I'm very glad I did. Why? It's AFWUL, especially the writing, followed at a close second by the pathetic, oft repeated self-importance. Run, run away FAST!"
1,Painful to read,"This book should have been a fun read. As a big rock fan, I bought this book anticipating an enjoyable reading experience. I figured as I read on, that the book would get better. Wrong! The author took every opportunity to document her beauty and talent, not only as a muse, but as a rock star in her own right (?) Her beauty you can see from the pictures of her past, but 300+ pages call this repeatedly to your attention, page after painful page. The writing was disjointed, with an annoying amount of exclamation marks.However, on a positive note, the author's explanation that a married Elvis Costello sends her hidden messages in his songs was truly a riot! Almost worth the read, although not quite."
1,Could have been good....,"I loved the stories, being a huge rock fan. I wish I had been alive in the 70's so I could do the things she did! This book, however, is very poorly written, repeats itself over and over, and Bebe Buell is a thoroughly unpleasant braggart. Try Pamela Des Barre's book instead."
3,"Amusing to read, but wow - is Bebe annoyingly vain","I was looking for something light to read, and this did provide some interesting stuff. Talk about a Wannabe though - this woman had some minor success of her own, but mostly squeezed herself into the fame of others...and she thinks she is really hot stuff. It got annoying fast. If you can stand to read about how great Bebe Buell thinks she is with regard to everything she has ever done, you might enjoy the rock and roll part of this book. On the other hand, her perception is obviously out of whack, so who knows if every story she shares is realistic."
5,I learned a lot from this book!,"I'm going to keep this short and sweet. Loved the book, love the woman who wrote it, love her daughter, love her daughter's father, love all the stories and pictures, love Bebe's self confidence, love the whole vibe of ""Rebel Heart"". Now stop whining and look for the things in art that are positive and good. There is a lot more good than bad about this book. Some of the negative stuff I read about this book isn't even in the thing. I looked for it and couldn't find it. People just jump on bandwagons and don't really scratch beneath the surface. There is a whole wonderful lesson to this woman's journey and it is, LOVE YOURSELF!!! Whats wrong with that? NOTHING!!! The book is entertaining and honest, SO THERE!!!"
2,POORLY made film,"If you want a good movie with actors who can act along with a great plot- don't get this one. It was poorly choreographed and the actors/actresses, well, cannot act. It was made out to be a kid/karate movie but was horrible. I don't recommend this to anyone over the age of about 9 or 10. The only reason the kids will probably like it is how the two kids do weird things to beat up the crooks (ex. the boy and girl escape on bad guy by sticking his face in a toilet and handcuffing his hands to the pipe, along with pulling his pants down to reveal boxers). I highly suggest you do not get this movie."
4,COURAGE,"I HAVE JUST FINISHED READING THE NARRATIVE OF DAVID CROCKETT FOR AN AMERICAN HISTORY CLASS AND HAVE TO DO A SHORT THREE PAGE PAPER ON THE BOOK. I WAS HOPING TO GET SOME IDEAS ON THE INTERNET TO HELP OUT WITH THE PAPER, AND SAW THIS LINK. THE BOOK WAS GREAT, EASY READING, AND INTERESTING TO THE READER, MYSELF. HOPE YOU ALL ENJOYED IT AS WELL AS I DID!"
4,Wonderful Book with Good Morals,"The author has done a wonderful job portraying the struggles and conflicts of an Idaho farm-boy with some big dreams, and the events that lead him to understand the deaper meanings in life.There was a production on cassette, but this is hard to find. I think the SLC public library may have a copy."
4,Batty Langley on Architecture and the 5 orders,"Betty tells it like it is. Written so long ago, still Langley is a good read. We use her stuff all the time to create wood block models of speciality structures that look real old. I like old buildings even when they are new. Really not too bad! It's really genuine stuff that Betty largely writes. The 5 orders make me tell a lot about design in generally. Loosely told and using comedic humor Betty tells it like it is. The 5 orders are real loose. You will like Betty too."
3,Students Savior!,"After reading the very large book, and being the video conosure that I am, I discovered that the BBC had put out a wonderful video version. It is very acurate to the novel in length as well as content. I highly recomend it to students!"
2,Bleak House,"When puchasing this item I had the choice of this particular presentation or the more recent BBC production featuring Gillian Anderon, Alun Armstrong and Charlie Brooks (2006). I chose the Diana Rigg, Denholm Elliott (1985)mainly because of cost. I have regretted my choice. I viewed the (2006) some time ago and now comparing the two, the more recent production was far superior.There were times through the film, if I had not known the story fairly well, I would not have had any idea of what it was all about until near the end. The colour was dark which seemed to add to its mystery.It must take great skill to bring out the depth of Dicken's study of human nature but this production seemed to miss it in my opinion. The acting was very good but it did not seem the right cast for Denhom Elliott; not his usual role.I wished I had spent the extra and got the later edition."
2,so-so,"Having not read the book...but knowing of its ""classic"" status...i gave this video version a try. I have to say i found it a bit boring and tedious... so i gave up on it after about 45 minutes. I found the colloquial English accents difficult to understand at times..which is not unusual for an American, i suppose. I'm sure they are quite authentic...which speaks highly of the cast...but it can be hard to follow at times. Dickens has always been sort of a ""hit-or-miss"" author to me...i love some of his books...but don't care much for others. The over all plot just didn't do much for me...atleast in video form. I read that it was a complex book with lots of sub-plots...which intrigued me since i'm a big fan of Tolstoy. I'll try reading the book first and then re-visit this video and update my review...if i change my mind."
4,Bleaker than the 2006 PBS version,"This earlier production of Dicken's Bleak House is not quite as good as the PBS production which was televised in 2006; but it is, nevertheless, a very good dramatization of this classic Dicken's novel."
4,Complicated story line,"My wife liked this but it was not one of her Dickens favorites. It is convoluted and, well, bleak. I have not yet watched it, so this rating is second-hand."
3,No Practical Help with Solving IFK's,"I was a little disappointed by this book. I had expected both descriptions and some practical help with methods to solve (or ""resolve"", as the author prefers to say) Fredholm integral equations of the first kind (IFK). Instead, the author devotes nearly 100% of his efforts to describing IFK's, why they are difficult to deal with, and why they can't be solved by any ""naive"" methods. I already knew that IFK's are problematic long before I purchased this book, which is why I bought it!This book is better suited for people who do not yet understand anything about IFK's or why they are difficult to solve. It is most definitely NOT a book that will help you with practical methods/strategies to solve IFK's. If you are looking for help with ways to code a reasonable solution in software (which was my objective), you will definitely need yo buy something else."
1,"Overpriced ""Common"" information","As a health professional in Nutrition, Regeistered Dietitian practicing in the Community Nutrition field, I thought this ""magazine"" would be full of up-to-date information. Rather I received an eight page ""newsletter,"" written at a fourth grade reading level. Everything written in the articles was old news. It was way overpriced for a product the size of my weekly ""Church Bulliten."""
1,"LAME outdated, mainstream information","This magazine is a joke. The first three issues had nothing that could not be found in a twenty year old issue of Self magazine. It reads like a statin advertisement, spewing the same old bull about high cholesterol without mentioning any of the myriad negative side effects of statins (like killing you of liver disease before you are even old enough to have heart disease).It contains very little research information, and nothing that is original or cutting edge in regards to prevention or nutrition. Complete waste of money!"
1,What's the purpose?,"The AC-4 willl power your Dimage camera, BUT IT WILL NOT CHARGE THE BATTERY! So, if you take all of your picture within 5 feet of an outlet than this is the product for you. If, say, you go outdoors on occasion you will need the BC-300 charger."
5,gotta get one,Great adapter. Great camera. What more can I say. Could have come with the camera though.
2,Find a different option.,"Ha, it's been a while since I bought these. They were not used long would come on and go off randomly. Picked up a lot of interference. Annoyed my wife to the point that I had to remove them within a week of installation."
2,VE1031M,"I can neither rate nor review this item, because I just realized I have to have two of them to use it. They call it an intercom system, but it is really only half a system. Amazon says there are only two left, so if this seems to be what you are looking for, better buy both. I bought a second one tonight."
2,"Runs small, and not returnable","I like this ankle brace, but it runs small and they won't let you return it. Therefore, I don't use it as much as I would like, because it is too tight. Since you don't want a brace to be too loose, either be really sure you have the right size, or buy it from a store where you can try it on or return it, or try something else. I used the measurements they gave, and it was still too tight."
1,"Good at first, should have invested in the better quality one...","I bought this thinking what a great deal for back pack straps. Turns out they fell apart within 3mos of use. First the shoulder strap seam split just a little bit, by weeks end it had completely split open. Then in one day the plastic that holds the straps broke, and not just on one strap. Totally garbage."
4,innova bag straps,decent straps if ur golfing on a hot day without a shirt as i often do then the straps are fairly abrasive do to the mess construction and the bag clips should really be metal not plastic as that is the part with the stress other then that shipping was fast and they have lasted so far hope to get many years out of them
2,Disappointed,"I thought this would be just like the original Rack-O. The cards are hard to read and have too much on them that is not needed for playing the original game. I just needed new cards, since my son and I wore out the first pack (from the original game). I'm sorry I bought this."
3,hurrycane,It does not stand on carpet. One of the feet comes off often. I have tried to contact hurrycane about this problem no response.
4,Rack-O Card Game,"We really love this family game. But...it wasn't the same game we had in the past years. There were no ""trump"" cards. Players who are familiar with this game will know what I mean. It's fun to play and teaches the younger kids to learn ""strategy"", but it would've been more fun to have the ""trump"" cards included. All in all our grandsons love playing this with their Grandpa. Also, the box cover wasn't the one shown as advertised. I would've rated this 5 stars if the ""trump"" cards were included."
1,not what is pictured,Amazon still has the problem of sending the WRONG Racko game. You will get the cheaper versionof this game (selling for about $8 on amazon.com). You get the blue box that contains plain white cardsnot what is pictured here. I have read the reviews complaining about this problem but was hoping thatamazon.com took care of it after people complained and retured the game (which is what I did) but amazonstill sends the wrong game.
2,Fun game....cheap cards,This game is a lot of fun....but the cards are so cheap! we played just a few games and they were already starting to tear.
4,Mom enjoys this game more than the kids,"Bought this for my 6 year old after reading some of the reviews. She definitely doesn't get it. My 9 year old doesn't have the attention span for it, and my 11 year old seems to not be able to quite get her head around the strategy required to play (I beat her every time, and I'm feeling bad about it!).Fun game for this mom (that's why it has 4 stars), just not right (yet) for my kids (when it is, I may have to update to 5 stars)."
5,Real Addicting...,I unfortuneately had to spend last week in the hospital but they had this game and my mom and I would stay up til 12:00 in the morning playing it. It is a great game that you can't play just once!
4,This is a hoot!,"I bought this with my 6 yr old in mind because he's so great at organizing and learning his numbers. However, I got this game out with a friend and we played it...it was a hoot! A nice variation from traditional adult card games."
1,Rack-o,"This game is loved by my family and me. I ordered two games in the past through Amazon from Firefly. Family members took the games home so I ordered one more through Amazon from Firefly. I received the one pictured on the website on the first order, but on the next order I received an older version Circa 1960, I believe. The current version is more visually appealing and can be played the traditional way or with an updated versions with more playing options. I returned the product. Return experience was easy and simple, but returned was made through USPS and item has not been received, but this is not Amazon's fault."
1,Not the one pictured,this game is great. The only problem is that the one pictured isn't the one you'll receive. It's a chaper copy that you shoulnd't pay more than $12 for. the one in the pic is MB not Hasbro. The MB one is far better.
4,"They Hate Games, but Love Rack-O","My husband, father, and nephew all hate games, and can barely be persuaded to play ANY game. But all three, once coerced into playing it for the first time actually LIKED it, and wanted their own game. It is a very simple game (for those 8 and up), doesn't take too much concentration, just a little luck, and it provides a little family time away from the TV. Kids also enjoy learning how to sequence their cards, and it teaches number value to the younger players. Good family game."
4,A family favorite!,"My family has been playing Rack-O for over a decade. The game is a nice combination of strategy and luck, so it challenges while still giving everyone a chance to win."
5,Racko is a family winner!,I have played Racko since I was a child. My husband and I then played it with our children as they grew up and now we are playing it with our grandchildren. It was not readily available in the local stores but I was lucky to find it on [...] and at a great price so we bought two for both of our children's families. Thanks for a great family game that has endured the generations and fun for every age!
4,5-4-3-2-1 * RACK-0 * I WIN!!,"I grew up playing games but had never heard of this until I got married. I guess my husband and his mom used to always play. It is great for all ages, it is educational for the little ones and strategy builder for the big kids. It is fun and addictive...you keep wanting to play because you were so close to winning! Add this one to your game closet it is guarenteed excitement for the family/friends. (only set back is max # of people is 4) You can play with 2, 3, or 4 players. There are a few variations to play to keep things intersting and easier ways for those who are just learning. +++ Get this one TODAY +++"
1,False advertising,"The product shown is not what you get. You get a different version of Rack-O which can be purchased for half the price. The version they send you is the $9.99 (retail price) Rack-O game with plain white cards with just the numbers on them. I ordered this item twice and finally was told that the item shown is not available. I complained to Amazom and requested that they remove this from their listing. They assurred me that they had, yet months later it is still here. Buy the $9.99 game (which is what you will get anyway) and save yourself $10.00."
4,Myziggy29,Great product. Loved playing as a kid and just bought it for my sister's students. They love the game. Good to learn logic.
2,"Skip this one, too dry","Have had the book 3 or 4 years and still try to use it to look up things, but without much success. The index gives any vague or indirect reference to the subject, sometimes I scan the whole page and never find the reference. I wind up looking up 3 or 4 citations and getting a sentence or two of information to use... one time for example, I wanted info on the Tabernacle in the Temple in Jerusalem.And for reading it cover to cover for general knowledge, I could not wade through it. The learned professors who prepared this no doubt know their subject, but I find it such dry reading I can only manage a half chapter now the then. Also note the copyright date is quite old, perhaps I should try a more recent reference, a little more modern. All the illustrations are in black and white and I would prefer more illustration than the book offers."
3,"An important historical event, and too long....","The concept and the subject matter... the stuff that makes glorious things possible! However, from the possible to a disaster it didn't take long for ruin to show its face. This is a painful thing to watch, something that you feel are required to witness, but can't watch although you feel you should. This project needed a talented editor, if so it could have been so much better. Rent it, I showed my enthusiasm by purchasing, and now, it collects dust on my library. Having said that, taste is a choice, and the momentous historical events should be examined, even if only in film, to understand the fiery delight of humans in destroying that which represents inequity."
2,A matter of Taste...,"A brilliant idea and highly informative, but to me, the execution of it was VERY long and dragged it's arse for this nearly 6 hour film. Still, check it out on Netflix..."
1,Intellectual Exercise in Unwearability,"As an intermediate level (not seasoned pro) jewelry designer, I eagerly awaited this book's arrival. What a disappointment! While there are some wonderful, creative rings in this book, far too many are unwearable and more than a few could be downright dangerous to wear! While there is a place for pushing a medium/project/idea beyond its previously defined parameters, this book provides little inspiration for, and appreciation of, a craft that is defined by its ability to be worn by real live beings. Art? Most definitely! Jewelry? I don't think so."
5,"Beautiful book, full of exciting possibilities","This book is the ""best buy"" of the year! The 1000 rings are beautifully photographed and printed on rich, glossy paper. Some rings are wild and wacky, some are more traditional, but all are well designed and finely crafted. If you are a jewelry artist, you will undoubtably be inspired by this book. Each time I look through it, I see something new. It is not intended to be a how-to book; it is a fun and informative look at the work of contemporary jewelry artists from all over the world."
2,"Should have been titled ""890 really weird rings, 110 masterpieces!""",No doubt the book is beautiful. The photographs and text are just enough for the eye-candy type book it was meant to be. My problem with it is that the title should have made it more clear that these rings are mostly 'artwear' and not jewelery like most of us expect. The book is intended for the experimental artists not for serious jewellers. There are *some* stunning examples of real jewelry and extremely creative and innovative styles but very few. The '500 brooches'book is the same. The cover and back plate are a little deceiving. Worth getting out of the library but not buying.
5,More World/New Age than 'General' Jazz,"Very well produced. Atmospheric, melodic but definitely not 'Smooth'. Richly textured sounds crossing a number of musical boundaries but still remaining attached to the jazz idiom, sometimes tenuously but its definitely there.Some excellent playing on all instruments both melodically and technically.Buy it."
2,Surround Air XJ3000C,"It does a nice job cleaning the air, but it is incredibly noisy!If you can stand the noise the machine generates, then it is ok, but if you are sensitive to annoying, vibrating type noises coming from the purifier, then think about a different product."
2,Headaches & coughing during use,"After reading the reviews I had high hopes for this purifier. Unfortunately after using a few nights in a small bedroom, my LO woke up abruptly with coughing & I awoke with headaches. Perhaps we are too senstive to the ozone production, I'm not sure. I've decided to return it & not gamble with uncertainty."
1,defective- and possbly hazardous,"I spent a lot of time looking at air purifiers and this one looked SO good..It had so many different types of cleaning methods..I wanted it to use in the bedroom, for allergies.We read the manual and set it up as instructed..After we plugged the unit in--there was a horrible chemical smell...We turned it down on low speed, and left it on low in our bedroom all night.When we awakened we had severe nasal congestion, headache and sore throat..Of course we turned the machine Off immediately. Our symptoms gradually disappeared..Sent it back to Amazon for a refund-- I think this machine would be hazardous toyour health!!!!"
2,Not strong enough,"While using this product on high settings it had a difficult time holding up a piece of paper. However this isn't what it's design for so I won't lower the rating based solely on that aspect. I did use this product in a 1 bedroom apartment on medium settings for 6 months and notice very little differences if any. Maybe my apartment is just very clean but there was no signs of dirt, dust, anything on the filter of this product."
5,Works as advertised,"I had read the previous reviews both pro and con.before i purchased this unit. what i was looking for was noise levels. amount of maintenance and cost. plus its ability to remove odors.. i decided to purchase the unit. glad i did, works well. as with anything there is room for improvement especially with the carbon section of the filter.overall ok for the price..."
1,Disappointed,The light bulb is supposed to be UV but appeared to be a regular light. It exhibited no UV qualities. So we sent it back.
2,Surround Air Multi-Tech XJ-3000C Air Purifier,"It did work for cleaning the air in a small bedroom at the begining; but the lifespan of this product is so short. Only used for few weeks, the fan or some other parts started giving big noise! We also bought the extra UV-bulb and the filter at the same time, and now we feel we shouldn't buy them too! Don't know what we should do with this thing now. Will not buy again!"
4,I think it works!,"Hard to say if something like this really works. Maybe it's in my head, but I like using it & feeling like the air is cleaner.We live in a fairly new home with our daughter & 2 dachshunds. Non-smokers. I just don't like seeing all the lint floating around from carpet, etc. I also like the sound at night-time. Very soothing.It's been almost a year, so time to order a replacement filter. I've pulled it out a few times & tried to beat the dust out (outside).Pretty happy overall. I also move it around from room to room, at times. Mostly, it stays in the master bedroom or family room.ps - I have used the ozone button to clear out cooking smells before; seems to help."
4,Great most of the time!,I have bought my 2nd purifier for another floor of my house; the first one I have had for a year I put in the basement because it was starting to get noisy even after putting a new filter in and cleaning it. Crossing my fingers the new one doesn't get noisy and rattle. Most of the time pretty quiet and works well. Got it mainly because of my pets and run it 24 hours a day.
3,"Light, believable biography","This book isn't so much a tell-all as a tell-what-she-knows-and-make-it-interesting. Thana Harris relates her experiences working and recording with Frank Zappa, which led directly to her meeting and working with Steve Vai and her future husband Bob Harris.Thana has a nice style that sounds more like a spoken conversation than a written treatise. She does seem to be hinting at some sort of spiritual belief that brought her together with these musicians, but she never really explains too well just what that belief might be.Not an absolute MUST, but if you're a Zappa fan it's nice to see him described by a female who doesn't claim to have slept with him. You come away from this book feeling like you've just met a very nice person."
1,Exploitative rubbish,"This is a dismal book. Badly written, unedited, and full of mistakes, this is truly a vanity project. Unless you are a member of Thana Harris' immediate family there is no reason whatever to purchase this. Frank Zappa fans looking for informative details on the recordings of Ms. Harris's overdubs on the ""Sleep Dirt"" tracks will learn nothing new. Fans of Bob Harris and/or Steve Vai may be a little less disappointed, but this is just one more book that only got published because it has a tenuous connection with Zappa. ..."
1,YUK !!!!!,Too chunky and did not taste as good as Bama Apple butter! Iam still looking for the taste BAMA apple butter.
2,Rent it... don't buy it,"Rent it... don't buy it.No too bad, no too good. Just rent it.It's just 20 min long after his presentation"
5,An absorbing tale,"Arab legends, and the Koran itself, speak of an ancient city of great wealth and great wickedness. This city was Ubar, the ""many-columned city."" In punishment for its idolatry and wickedness, Allah destroyed Ubar. Legends further tell that a number of people, lost in the great Arabian desert, have seen the ruins of the great city and told of the wealth that it still contains. In the 1980s, Nicholas Clapp, a noted filmmaker, became absorbed with the legend of Ubar. Searching ancient manuscripts, and using ultramodern techniques, Clapp set out to uncover this ""Atlantis of the Sands."" This is the story of that search.I found myself really enjoying this book, much more than I had ever expected. It is well-written, dramatic, and succeeds in keeping you in suspense. When I first picked the book up, I was interested in the subject, but the author succeeded in making me very interested indeed."
4,An adventure story worth reading,"This is the remarkable story of a documentary fillmaker who decided to play amateur archeologist and discover an ancient lost city. The book is most interesting where it talks about the author's travels in Oman, the country where the lost city was located. I now have a strong desire to visit Oman and see the remarkable sights for myself. Many readers are likely to feel the same desire after reading this worthwhile book."
1,superficial book,This is a potentially good archeology story. It has far too much personal reference and not enough hardcore reference.
5,Excellent Film,"Purchased this film on DVD a few weeks ago. It was packaged very nicely. The quality is beautiful. The production itself is extraordinary. It captures the essence of Philadelphia's ""Rittenhouse Square"" the way it is if you were thinking of visiting Philadelphia for a weekend in the summer. The musicians are the soul of Philadelphia. It is inspirational for young musicians because it features some young musicians playing their music in the park for visitors to enjoy. The setting lends itself to music of all kinds. It also features folks of all ages and their commentaries. This is a perfect picture to watch as a family because it has something for everyone. I highly recommend this film to others thinking of purchasing it. You will not be disappointed."
5,Giotto 5-section PPod,"Awesome Product, does everything I want it too. This was the perfect peice of equipment for me. It is light, portable and very functional."
2,really disappointment of the monopod,"Monopod wight is acceptable, the Quick Release Plate will still move even if you tight the nope to the maximum, when extend each part of the tube to the maximum it cant hold itself so I put it back inch or two to avoid breaking it, the head is big but it get lose quickly and I can't trust it and the three stand legs are heavy and they came un even in my package and looks like someone used it before!"
5,"Greaat service, and a great product. Thanks","This is a high quality monopod, and service was great. Five stars. This well worth it. I can't say enough. Thanks again."
2,Finger crusher,The good:Built in quick release and tilting head.The bad:Heavy.Tilting head doesn't provide sufficient friction to prevent heavy lens from flopping forward. Quick release thumb screw protrudes in line with tilt axis. When your heavy lens flops forward the thumb screw will crush your finger between the screw and the body of the monopod.Remedies:Keep thumb screw at back of monopod.Drill and tap a new hole for thumb screw 90 degrees from original hole.
5,The P-Pod is a brute!,"The Giottos P-Pod is definitely of beefy construction. If you are attacked by a bear, you have a great weapon. It also works very well as a monopod too! It might be a little high fully extended for some people but I figured I might be standing on something and may need the extra height. I would only use the tripod setup at it's minimum length or extended (while having a good grip)for extra support. It is not meant to be a tripod replacement. It is good used in the macro mode (2 legs in collar). Will get you low but stable. The 24"" collapsed length is not great but is workable. The head with quick release plate works as intended but also if the plate is left slight loose, camera will pan very well with less wear on rubber foot. Tilt is very fluid. Overall, it is a monopod and works as one would expect. I like mine very much and I know it will last a very long time."
2,Pass on this one.,"This is a standard historical adventure in British history. Unfortunately, it is not very exciting. The history is interesting, and the travails of Ben and Polly are okay. However, there are no plot twists. And the Doctor has very little ""screen time."" Most of the adventure is with Ben and Polly, who are plain, wood-cut characters. Gatiss also seemed to include lots of filler to get the necessary 280 pages for BBC Books publishing requirements. The Doctor tries to get out of a guarded room for several pages, only to re-enter the room and be ushered away by an antagonist. I don't recommend this one--don't waste your time."
5,Wonderful CD,"This CD is better than I'd imagined, Neon Bible being the first AF album I'd ever heard. And, like all their songs, it took me a few listens to really love the album. But that's how it is with a lot of good music, and AF is definitely good music.My only complaint was with the packaging, which sometimes ripped as I pulled out the CD (it's a paper case). But that was probably my own fault, not the manufacturers. Overall, the CD is wonderful and it's almost a crime not to hear it. Enjoy!"
4,a purchase you will not regret,"from the first strains of sound, this album delivers. for me, personally, it stands out with a sound different from the standards of the day, which is a good thing. this album makes me feel like i am part of a story and i want to travel to the end to see where i sonically go.worthy of your ears and your time (and your money)"
4,very very good,The Arcade Fire are amazing live. The record is great too -- but if you have seen the Arcade Fire live you know that they are destined to be huge. The album itself is full of energy and inspiration and gets better for me with every listen. I don't think it is a perfect album --- but definitely in the top 20 of this year.
1,overhyped and boring,"After reading the countless positive reviews, seein it number 1 on critics list i was expecting either someting that was truly great or just boring hipster music that critics eat up like candy. And well it turned out just to be boring hipster music that critics love. I am completly in awe about all the hype and praise this ""music"" has been getting. i really cant believe rock has sunck this low"
2,Nothing special,"I have to say, after listening to these 30 second music clips, I can't help but wonder why everyone so enamored of this band. I think if I wanted to hear music like this, I would check out Ed Harcourt. Harcourt is more talented, and his voice is much better."
5,We need to talk...,"Alright! First off, to all of you elitist, indie drones, is anything truly original anymore? Get off your high horse! Yes, the Arcade Fire might sound reminiscent of early U2 or the Talking Heads, but they've moved on. U2 is the most dried up, failed attempt at a come back I've ever seen. And the Talking Heads died with the 80's, with dignity, and David Byrne sounds completely different. So how about giving these guys a chance.The Arcade Fire is so amazing. I'd heard of them before, and the other day I was at the record store and I grabbed my friend Camy by the arm as my heart began to flutter...the sounds of some kind of epic, theatrical, chamber music plane crash were filling the air. I asked her who it was. ""The Arcade Fire"", she replied. Needless to say I bought Funeral instead of NMH on vinyl. And the CD has only left my stereo twice since I bought it, two weeks ago. I love this album and so will you. There, I said it."
1,One of the worst recorded albums I've ever heard,"I can't review the music on this album because I only made it through half. I suppose the songs were OK and, if the second half sounded like the first, it might rank 3 stars. The problem is that this final master must have been engineered by a moron. We've all heard of the loudness wars, but this CD sets a new bar for horrific levels of compression. It is unlistenable. Really, anyone who let this CD leave the engineering studio sounding like it does should be completely ashamed. It's an insult to anyone who buys the product. I would say that the artist should be upset their music was treated this way, but in the end they are the ones that should be saying ""No, we can not release an album that sounds this bad"". Maybe the LP sounds better? The CD gets excellent reviews, so maybe trying the LP would be worthwhile, I just have a hard time getting over the fact that this artist let this CD be released to their fans."
3,Very unique,"I had no idea what I was getting into when I decided to purchase this. About two months ago I had purchased The Woods by Sleater-Kinney and I was looking for something that was of a similar type of energy. I definitely got what I was looking for as far as how the music sounded overall, yet subject matter is quite depressing, I must say - although I guess that is to be expected with a CD titled Funeral. Lyrics are quite clever, yet the overall feel of the vocals in the album is general discontentment with life. I do enjoy the album, so I'd recommend it to anyone in the mood for something different."
2,Hyped Up,"I think these guys were a bit hyped up to me by my friends. The singers voice gets a little pesky after a while. It is a nice record but not as great as they have been described(hyped to me). I am still going to give it a few more listens, perhaps it will grow on me. I did hear they are awesome live.(I need to find some new music! I listen to Nat King Cole(This dude had a voice!), Tony Bennet and Big Band music from the 40's!)Peace out"
3,One of the most overrated albums of all time,"I kept hearing the hype and gave it a spin. I didn't get it. So, I gave it another and another. I even went to see them live so that maybe I would ""get it."" Nope. They have some really good songs, and are good live performers, but they are just a really really OK indie band. I'm a huge fan of Neutral Milk Hotel, Decemberists, Shins all of whom they've been compared to. But this is just not greatness. Pitchfork has created a monster."
2,Game Over,"Every year there's a new city (Montreal) that is hyped up beyond belief and the bands that come from there or unfairly hyped up as well (let me guess - there's a girl in this band as well). Most of the time these hyped up bands never live up to expectation and or they are just plain bad. With the Arcade Fire, I wouldn't quite say they are bad but they are definitely a big letdown. The idea of starting a song soft and slow and then having it come to some sort of crescendo seems like a good idea but not for two to three songs on the same album. Other than that, there just wasn't anything that really tickled my fancy about this album. If there was something, most of the time it was a rip off of some other band (New Order drum beat). This is definitely one of those albums that you listen to once or twice and then trade it in at your local record shop. Sorry Spin Mag. and Brooklyn hipsters."
3,Don't (quite) believe the hype,"I suspect that, like many who picked up the CD, it was done based on rave reviews elsewhere. However, after giving a couple of listens to this CD, I have to admit being mildly disappointed. I was expecting tremendous things, but ""Funeral"" did not deliver. Perhaps it is the victim of heightened expectations; I don't know. Still, there are some excellent moments on this CD; however, they do not add up to a classic - certainly not one that ranked very high on critics' polls. The lead singer has both an off-putting and intriguing singing voice. It reminds me a bit of Roger Waters of Pink Floyd. For a debut album, this is very good. The talent is there, and I expect great(er) things from Arcade Fire. For now, I would easily give the nod to fellow Montrealers Stars ""Set Yourself on Fire"", which is the better of the two CDs."
4,Im glad my first time is with you . . .,"this is my first review, but thats all behind us now. i heard alot of hype about this album from respectable sources, but this thats happened before with not much of a result. i decided to preview it on amazon and listened to 30 seconds of each track. well that was all i needed. i bought album earlier tonight, so this review is a tad premature, but i can already guarantee (on third listen) this is a must have album for many a music fan. definately one of those albums that puts you in a specific space, time, feeling. a nice warm one. words i would use to describe this album:-triumphant-relentless-inspriring-flat-out-beautifulsort of brings to mind a more melodic and danceable broken social scene. i first described it as bowie vocals with talking heads sparaticness and modern, intense, theatrical music. definately worth a chance. hope this review helped."
4,It works for me,"Some bands you have to dig for, or Amazon suggests to you and you buy...Either way its a joy to find these gems. This album is a great listen from beginning to end. Love the melodies, love the lyrics, love the passion. If you find great pleasure, as I do, from music that moves your soul you must get this album today."
4,4.5 stars if possible,"This is an amazing album. It really excites me that there are actually some good bands like this still out there. Arcade fire is like a flashback to when rock and roll had a natural energy that was undeniable, and they capture that energy perfectly on this album. Although they do have a sort of vintage 70s rock meets 80s punk sort of sound, they still sound completely original and completely fresh. You would probably never mistake them for some band from twenty years ago that you'd never heard before. They are certainly influenced by the past, as all artists should, but they don't seem to have any trouble making the sound their own. The entire album is great, and I hope to hear more out of this band very soon."
5,Amazing New Band,"Amazing Album. You don't want to miss this. Every song here has beautiful lyrics and beautiful sound. The Arcade Fire Funeral is definitely one the best albums of 2004 I believe it should be with the top 3. Their songs are different yet touching. Such as ""Neighborhood #1 Tunnels"" which is somewhat dark yet touching. One the most beautiful tracks I think. ""Laika"" has a sort of dance beat to it. ""Power Out"" also has some amazing lyrics, that are very moving. ""Crown of Love"" nice little song. ""Wake up"" has cool lyrics and a sweet beat. ""Haiti"" is sung by the girl who as just as cool a voice as the guy. ""Rebellion (Lies)"" is the best track on the album, it has the best lyrics, and the best sound. ""In the backseat"" is sung by the girl again and its a good song to finish the album Funeral with.This band was also nominated for Grammy for this CD and for an awesome song called Cold Wind on the Six Feet Under Soundtrack. This is my new favorite band. Indie Rock at its best and further on."
5,beautiful.,This album is just beautiful. Each song tells a story and takes me to away to a fairy tale land. The grandiose music and layered instruments blend together to create a magical delightful atmostphere that takes my breath away just listening to it.
5,it has that first album fire,"I'm a newcomer to Arcade Fire, sure I've heard their songs bouncing around here and there and when I have I've thought *wow, who is that?* but due to my heavy degree of scatter-brainedism, I forget before I can look them up. a friend of mine really introduced this group to me a few weeks ago and I've really been loving the heck out of them ever since. there's a lot of talent here. if you enjoy indie-rock at all, Funeral is a great addition to your repertoire."
4,As good as it gets for a first album,"I am a recent fan of AF and started with Neon Bible. This debut album reminds of the feeling of pure raw driven energy I heard in the first efforts by The Cure, U2, Cranberries and Talking Heads. This is not to say AF's sound is similar to those bands but that I heard unique genuine compositions coming from the heart with potential for greatness. Those other bands went on to more polished sophisticated and popular work but the early stuff containing the seeds of success has an unadulterated feel that cannot be matched. My favorites are Wake up, Haiti, Rebellion. Even after weeks of repeated listening I'm still overcome when Regine begins ""Haiti, mon pays ..."""
5,Incredible,"This is an album I bought without having any expectations, and it continues to blow me away. This music is certainly not for everyone, but if you appreciate musicians with vision and passion - check them out."
5,late to the game,"Of course, much of what can be written about this album is already here, but I thought this was lovely, strange and familar (NMH, anyone?). If you don't have it, get it."
3,Thoroughly Nonplussed,"After having so many of my friends ask me if I listen to Arcade Fire, I decided it was finally time to give them a try, so I picked up this album. Honestly, I am not impressed at all. I give the album three starts because it's definately on the good side - it's not a BAD album to listen to, but it doesn't DO much for me. Specifically, I find that it doesn't really provide much of an original sound that you can't find in most of the other indie rock that everyone seems to be listening to these days. The die hard fans may think I'm crazy, but I really don't care."
4,The Arcade Fire - Funeral CD,"(I found this CD to be in quality condition with no injuries upon delivery.)As for the CD overall, I saw this band before they became mainstream and loved them, so when I saw this CD at such a cheap price, I had to buy it. The Arcade Fire is a unique band with a variety of songs. Some of their pieces are eerie and soft, where others are up-beat and fun. I would suggest this CD to someone who is looking for a change from their average choice of music to serve as something to lessen the drastic change. The Arcade Fire is very agreeable music."
1,"if you subscribe to NME, buy this album","if you're the type of person that buys albums after reading a lot of hype without having heard any actual music (i.e. those who own albums by elefant, stellastarr, etc.), then this album is for you. beyond calculated, it's like somebody conducted a focus group on what's popular in indie rock and came up with this. take ""Neighborhood #4 - 7 kettles"" for example, the album's painfully awkward ""dance track"", undoubtedly a response to the focus group's finding that dance-y stuff is currently ""in"". the album's song titles outdo even coheed and cambria in pretentiousness. the whole endeavor is a virtual homage to the city of omaha. do yourself a favor don't buy this garbage because you will think it's a masterpiece for 36 hours and then never listen to it again."
2,Not all that enjoyable,"I was recommended this album by Amazon, and read all the great reviews, so figured I'd give it a shot. So I get it yesterday, throw it in...and man, it's bad. Not awful, but just bad. The rifts are decent - reminds me a bit of Neutral Milk Hotel - but the lead singer is just awful. Just thinking about his voice gives me a migraine. In the end, I'm going to go against the grain and say move on."
2,Artsy fartsy indie rock at its most pretentious,"Besides a couple good songs, this much ballyhooed ""critics darling"" of a band's new album is nothing to write home about.Annoying, smug, whiney vocals.Obscure, abstract song titles.Threadbare hooks.Probably makes the Neutral Milk Hotel clones, the Decemberists, proud."
1,5th rate New Order ripoff,"""Power Out"" is nothing but a 5th rate New Order rip off with a Wayne Coyne wanna be on vocals. It's like they took the rhythm section of New Order's ""Temptation"" and the guitar work from ""Age of Consent"" and came up with this lame song...how unoriginal can you get?"
4,Everyone loves a good Funeral,"What can I say? I love this album. I generally like music that makes me feel something when I hear it. I'm not looking for what's new, hot, underground, indie, etc. I am just a music fan with a great ear for music, and this moves me. It has that indie rock feel to it, but surpasses the ""members-only"" connotation associated with a lot of newer indie bands. It really connects."
5,Stunning,"At first I didn't know what to think about this band since there was so much hype around them. But once I actually sat down and listened to the album, I truly started to see their beauty.There is a sense of urgency and honesty in the music. Something that I haven't heard in a long time.I highly recommend this album to everyone. I was very pleasantly surprised (for once) from a band with a lot of hype."
3,Not for everyone...,"With the raves this album has received, it seemed like a 'no miss' purchase. What grabs so many reviewers is totally lost on me. The drum machine-sounding rhythm is endless while artsy vocals quiver throughout songs that ultimately became repetitive. It wasn't the 'no brainer' acquisition that I read it into being. Its worth doing a little more research on this one if you're sitting on the fence."
4,Stars Of Funeral,"Melankolija pocinje od samoga pocetka sa Tunnels i zavrsava sa manje interesantnom pesmom In The Backseat. Najsvetliji momenti albuma Funeral su:Laika(pesma koja ce vas naterati hteli vi to ili ne da cupkate), Une Annee Sans Lumiere (koja ce se zalepiti za vase srce i tamo ostati vecno), i Rebellion (ultimativni singl za 2005.).Sve u svemu, i ako po mom misljenju precenjen album, vrediga imati u kolekciji.1.Tunnel 5/52.Laika 5/53.Une Annee Sans Lumiere 5+/54.Power Out 4/55.7 Kettles 4/56.Crown Of Love 5/57.Wake up 4/58.Haiti 4/59.Rebellion( Lies)5/510.In the backseat 1/5"
3,"It's OK, but come on...","First off, I want to say that I am writing this review as a reaction to the fact that all the bands I browse these days on Amazon.com have this album in the ""customers who bought this also bought"" list. Are you serious? As if that's to suggest that if any X Y or Z band peaks my interest, I'll love this album by default. I'm sorry, but this album isn't groundbreaking, nor is it transcendant enough to somehow mix perfectly amidst practically every other band I may (or may not) enjoy. The editorial review says fans of Neutral Milk will like this? I'd venture to disagree.This album has about three, maybe four standout songs, but the rest is good enough for background listening, nothing more. I won't go as far as to say trite, but it's borderline. I think the lyrics are sophomoric and uninspired. The vocal stylings can at times become annoying.I guess all in all, it has effort, but lacks *heart*"
2,I Work At Starbucks And I Love The Arcade Fire,"Are you are wearing a brand-new pair of distressed lo-rise Diesel jeans, a ringer t-shirt with a silly 1970s logo printed on it, and perhaps a pair of suede Pumas? This is the ideal soundtrack to match your outfit, then: bland, trendy consumer product for your ""alternative"" lifestyle. The shrewd critical ears at Pitchfork named this the #1 album of 2004, and I'm sure the songs are soon to appear on ""The O.C."" No doubt this record's in heavy rotation right now at all the Urban Outfitters stores. Enjoy!Soundwise, most of the tracks owe a big debt to Yo La Tengo (ambient guitarscapes) and Neutral Milk Hotel (string section, goofy/vulnerable lyrics). It seems a shame to compare either of those great bands to the Arcade Fire, however, except to suggest your money would be better spent on ""Painful"" or ""In The Aeroplane Over the Sea"" instead of this."
1,I don't get it,"So many people whose taste I respect told me this was a brilliant new sound from an exciting new band, so I bought it sound unheard.I played it 4 times, sitting and listening all the way through without distraction. I don't get it. Nopthing about this appeals to me. It sounds (to me)like pretentious mishigosh run through a blender and then poorly mastered.I must be missing something. But it's not this CD; I gave it away to a friend who tells me he likes it a lot."
4,fun for the thirtysomething hipster,"I can't help but think of early Echo & The Bunnymen when I hear this (the reference to Ian McCulloch's voice is obvious). And then maybe a little Birthday Party, Pixies and even some very early OMD for good measure. Maybe that's why I feel like I've been listening to Funeral since high school."
3,Repetitive,"*Review From A Classic Rock FanI found this album to be very repetitive. Maybe not in the song structures or lyrics, but in the sound. I have listened to this five times now and I still have not found an amazing song that really sticks out among the rest. The upside to this however is that there is not a bad note, making this album just OK. It is the album's sound that has probably made it so popular, because then there is not much room for criticism. However, that is why I like there next album so much more, because it is so much more diverse, and something that I would recommend well before this one."
2,A love it or be bored by it band/album,"There are obviously a lot of fans of this album, and they all rate the most glowing reviews as ""helpful"". I can't say they are wrong, but for me, my advice is to listen to them on Youtube before you buy, or buy a few tracks from Amazon before you commit. At least 3 songs. The lead singer's voice may sound intriguing on the first song, but it never changes. You may love it, or it may just wear on your nerves with its winey-ness. The echo-chamber effect and fuzzy overlay may be magical or monotonous. I am certain that I will be attacked now by the true believers, who will insist that either a musical idiot or that I like heavy metal or something. But I am just saying this album will likely not leave you thinking ""it's pretty good"". It will be either ""Incredible"" or ""I guess it was okay""."
2,What the last guy said,"This album is so overrated, and more frustrating is the fact that the only great song on here is greatly overlooked (""Tunnels""). I will go so far as to say that these guys will never inspire me again, because any time the first song on your first major album is the only good song on the record, chances are you don't have anything more to offer. U2 must be trying to act hip by playing Arcade Fire before their live shows."
5,Anti-depressants without the pills,"I love this album. I accidentally came across it at my local library and thought the cover was interesting. I have it on my iPod (along with Neon Bible) and their music is very uplifting and soothing. It reminds me off sunny brisk Spring afternoons. It reminds me of Broken Social Scene, so if you like them, you'll probably dig this."
4,BUY THIS CD!!,"This CD is fantastic.. I just got it, came out in 2004, but WOW! it recalls alot of 80's alternative stuff but they do it well and make something I think is derivative but new and fresh at the same time. Great CD.. I will be listening to this for years.."
1,Is this really to be considered alternative rock?,"Browsing through the alternative rock pages of amazon, I came upon this record.As it was highly-rated (4 stars and a half on average), I listened to all the samples. I simply did'nt liked any. (I'm not judging the words, just the music).So, I'm telling you just that.Just a question of taste in the end, so don't be influenced by me and give it a try, but on the samples before buying it!!!"
5,"Absolutely love it, one of my new favorites!","there are not too many cd's that i instantly love, but this one hit the jackpot. after all, these are the guys that inspired cold play to bring their best at ACL. such a beautiful, uplifting collection quite unlike anything else. this one earned an immediate spot in my car.......reserved for my top 6 (cause that's all that fits). who else am i playing in my car, you ask? snow patrol, wolf parade, modest mouse, the killers and steve burns."
5,u need this,"this album tops the best of everyones 2004 list all the time. believe the hype. if you are reading this review to figure out if you should buy this album... stop wasting time and go buy it. ts not the best of only 2004, but in my humble opinion one of THE BEST ALBUMS OF ALL TIME. my generations dark side of the moon. from begining to end a true gem. i own it on vinyl and cd. i would buy it on cassette too if i had a tape player... i do have to admit that my brother bought my first copy as a gift, which is perhaps why i gave it a chance. give it some time to grow on you (cuz i dont think there are really any SINGLES on the disc). beautiful crescendos!"
5,Best new music,"I bought this CD after seeing The Arcade Fire at the Hollywood Bowl. Although they were not the headliner, they should have been, we were all rocking in the aisles. I love this CD, do not let the name distract you. Several members of the band lost members of their family and that is why they named it Funeral, but more than a tribute, it is the best new music I have heard in a very long time. I can hardly wait for their next CD! Great listening, or to dance to. We took the CD camping and listened to it over and over the whole time. The energy of the band is very high! This band is very talented with instruments, including violin, accordian, and steel drums. Buy it, you will like it."
5,Wow,"...just wow. Imaginative, fresh, colorful, endearing. The Arcade Fire rocks, and then it's barely a whisper. This is one of those ""under the radar"" cd's. You know the kind, the kind of cd where you feel a little ""hurt"" personally when you find out the band's not very popular.When ""Funeral"" caught my ear a few months ago, I liked it. Then I started peeling back the layers and found something I liked a lot. Do these guys really play a tea kettle? Did ""Wake up"" really fade out one to the faintest two voices and then rebuild itself? Is that French?Brilliant. Perfection. A masterpiece."
4,Bold entrance,"Not many debuts made such a sonic claim to new generation indie supremacy like the obvious frames around Funeral. Coming out like an effortless concoction of excellent prior-generation groups like Modest and Pixies with a slightly more informed, and certainly wider ranging, musical bite, is that often needed reminder disc to proclaim why you in fact started enjoying this genre. Of course anthemic heights scaled can only occur so often, unfortunately, but a certain level of consistency is met to deserve at least some of its immense praise."
2,Help them sing on pitch,"Wow... talk about where the state of music is going. Just saw them on Saturday Night Live and checked out some of their tracks. How did they ever land that gig? Oh yeah, SNL has been tanking for some 20 years now and the only thing more amazing is how Lorne Michaels has kept his job. But I digress. At the end of a bizarre, boring, overly self-justifying song the lead singer smashes his guitar into small pieces on stage. Ho-hum. Already been done and if your 6 chord endlessly repeated melody can be modified ever so slightly by adding yet another absurd texture from your big band, then it's beyond me to say how. The opening church organ sounded interesting but the only funeral going on here is for this band. Backing vocals all off pitch, music going nowhere. Check it out before you buy."
1,Dont listen to the hype listen to the music,"Nowadays the trend in music seams to be taking styles and sounds from older bands and repacakaging them. It would be okay if it were only a few bands but now it seams that ALL of rock n roll is following that format. except for a few orignal sounds here and there most of it is just echoing the 70s and 80s. After listening to this cd i did not feel exicted or inspired, i found parts of it pretty boring. There is nothing special about the band or its music nothing special at all it just follows all the rock n roll hipster ""indie"" trends and follows them real well..which probably explains all the praise and attention this forgetable album has been recieving."
4,light the fire,"Canada's answer to The Polyphonic Spree, (my hometown heroes here in Dallas), this emotionally uplifting and stirring chaos-chorus is tapping into something primal and elevating it to new heights.No wonder Bowie insisted on working with them. Funeral is a breath of fresh air."
4,Promising,The Arcade Fire is a very promising act. To they sound like if you mix very old Talking Heads with classic british Wave band Sad Lovers And Giants. Then you add a little canadian flavour from the likes of Stellastarr or even the Spoons as well as some more poppy elements. Then shake it all well and enjoy. That's the best Funeral you can get. Believe it or not! I especially recommend track no. 9 or 1.
3,Pretty derivative and not my kind of thing,"Never listened to Roxy Music, but from my frame of reference this sounds like Bowie meets Lou Reed in a not real interesting kind of way. Decent production values and musicianship but kind of watered down and not really my kinda thing...I have no idea why they are recommending this based on my high ratings of Dinosaur Jr., Pixies, Fugazi, and Archers of Loaf albums... Seems like this will produce alot of unhappy buyers."
5,Put this sucker on repeat.,"Amazing music, amazing band. Go and get? Yes. Better than Neon Bible, but Neon Bible is worth gtting too. If you haven't listened to arcade fire, why not?"
4,Crazy but very GOOD!!!,"Didn't like it too much at first but it grows on you after 2 weeks.. i think my mind couldn't categorize the music maybe?? it's all i listen to when i work out now.. 8 of the songs are great.. 2 are ok.. Track 2 is incredible.. read the words on the lyric sheet on that one and you will be cracking up.. crazy crazy sometimes but some songs are very touching and personal.. cool CD - the neighbors must think i'm nuts with how i blast it in the garage every sunday.. that's ok.. if the neighbors don't like it ""THEY CAN DANCE IN THE POLICE DISCO LIGHTS!"" (SEE TRACK 2).. get this it is nuts and emotional and sometimes slow but GOOD !!!"
5,another great find by merge,"no one has a better ear for new bands then mac and laura from Merge, and no one from Canada has such an original inpact on my indie rock music than tne Arcade fire."
2,"I wanted to like it, but it sucks","I typically like the over-hyped indie bands and am a big fan of many bands that seem to be lumped in with Arcade Fire, but I just don't get this band. I've tried. Over and over. And it keeps pissing me off, because even when I don't like a band I can at least see why other people like them. This band has nothing. The singers voice is so irritating it renders it unlistenable. There is no song structure and no discernible song writing ability. I want to see what you see, but alas The Arcade Fire just don't cut it. If you are reminded of Brian Eno, Talking Heads, David Bowie then go to the source. Forget it, it doesn't matter anyway."
2,nowhere near the best album of the year,"everybody who has reviewed this album ever has said ""oh my god how awesome is this album,"" when they're only saying that because everybody else says its great. this is by no means a great album and the arcade fire is definitely not rock music. if you want great rock music in today's world go to bloc party and spoon. if you want an album and band that is extremely trumped by those two bands then take a look at funeral. everyone says how the arcade fire is so masterful with their ability to perform eclectic rock at its finest. they limit themselves on the instruments because they're just not good musicians. the only salvagable songs from this wreck album are ""rebellion (lies)"" and the second ""neighborhood"" song. a truly waste of $13."
2,Skinny Puppy Blows This Fellow Canadian Band Out of The Water,"Skinny Puppy, the greatest band to ever come out of Canada blows this right out of the water. If you'd rather listen to the future of music listen to their latest album, The Greater Wrong of the Right. Not this rehash of the Pixies and other indie college rock from the late 80's. If you want that go listen to music from the Pixie's back catalog. Ok, some of Arcade Fire's stuff is pretty catchy pop, gotta give it that. Still, I think they're vastly overrated and not original enough to warrant the praise they've received."
1,Sell it while you can!!!,"This is perhaps the most over hyped cd this year. I have given it several shots, and not once does it get off the ground. Very repetitive, and boring. I heard comparisons to these guys and other bands that I listen to, let me tell you these guys separate themselves from the pack....they are just plain dull. Perhaps it was the trendy art cover, or the cool name...You got me, because I have no idea what the buzz about this band is. Thank heaven I was able to cash in and sell it, right here to one of the 5 star reviewers."
1,derivative lightweight pop,"I have absolutely no idea where the hype for this album comes from. If all you listen to is ClearChannel radio, then I guess this album might sound like a breath of fresh air. But if you're at all familiar with any decent indie, garage, or post-rock music, you'll immediately recognize many far more talented bands whose sound The Arcade Fire is desperately ripping off. A lame attempt to sound like a cross of The Talking Heads, Modest Mouse, and pretty much every indie band of the 90's, this album falls absolutely flat. I've given this album multiple listens in the hope of figuring out what the big deal is, and am giving up. There just isn't anything there. If you think Gwen Stefani is ""cutting edge"", or if you still think that ""alternative"" music can be played on MTV then maybe you'll enjoy listening to this music just because your 15 year old cousin doesn't listen to them yet. Whatever, save your money."
2,off-base dictionary,"Professor Echeruo knows too well that Igbo people live both in the eastern and mid-western parts of Nigeria. The map in the dictionary, while showing this fact, claimed that the Igbo live in eastern part of Nigeria. Also, Mike knows too well that the alphabet ""c"" does not exist in Igbo orthography. ""Chi"" is inseparable with the Igbo in philosophy and cosmology. Would Professor Echeruo wish that we begin to spell it ""Ci""? I believe that the ""dictionary"" can be vastly improved with many omitted words and better production."
2,"Some laughs, regressive ideology","A middle ground half-cooked French comedy about the relationship between money and love. But in the end this connection seems superfluous and counter-reality. Money in this film is not influent in relations. Money must be spent but you must care to your finances, is what the film says. The less rich a character, the less developed his history (poor working mother, for example). Social, ethical or even commonsense implications of actions are not even discussed. Ideologically, regressive; dreams of the middle class. Had some cheap laughs, that's true."
4,Warning! This game does not work on iPAQs,"I installed this on my iPAQ, but soon found that it was not compatible. I did play monopoly on my friends PDA and it was great."
3,Minolta case,I find the camera fits perfectly in the case and there is decent cushioning to protect the camera. The draw back with this case is the front pocket which is to hold extra battery/memory card is way too big and doesn't hold the extra battery in place. Every time I open the case to remove the camera the battery falls out. If I had known this prior to purchasing the case I would have gotten a different one.
3,Case,I find that the camera fits perfectly in the case. The case is compact and has decent cushion for protection. They only bad thing is the front pocket which is for extra battery/memory card is too big. The extra battery I put in mine is always falling out when I open the case to take out the camera. If I had known this before I purchased it I would not have bought it.
1,"Not comfortable, not recommended","These shoes are so cute but I was disappointed with these Naturalizers. I expected comfort, but the fabric is so unforgiving."
2,Cannot recommend this shoe,"I purchased this shoe in a 10N. Although I like the look of the shoe, there are two problems with it: #1- The shoe is not narrow even though it is called ""narrow"". My feet slid around in these. I wear a 10N in every brand that I have ever owned, and these just don't fit. #2- The linen fabric is truly more like burlap. It is not comfortable and the back strap is not adjustable.These were a complete disappointment. Sorry- they really are cute looking!"
5,Espadrilles,I love espadrille and was happy to see them back in style. I couldn't find them locally but there they were in Amazon. I love them. I bought a black pair at the same time.
5,cute and comfy,"I've received tons of compliments on this shoe. It is really cute, and most importantly, comfortable. Not too high like most espadrilles, so I can wear them while juggling my 5 month old and groceries at the same time. I got them in brown. If your feet are somewhat wide, I would suggest getting the wide size, because the peep-toe part is pretty narrow."
1,Expected comfort...,"I got these shoes because I thought they were so cute for what I thought would be a ""Naturalizer comfortable"" shoe. They do look very cute on. However, the toe opening cuts into my big toes and makes them hurt so much I cannot wear these! Sorry I spent the money on them :("
4,Detailed account of the Arab-Israeli wars,"I knew nothing about Israeli history prior to reading this book and this book gave a very thorough account of the birth of Israel and the subsequent wars Israel had to fight against the Arabs for the country's very survival.Although the book at times goes into excrutiating detail about the military battles, it was definetly worth the read. Some of the battle accounts are filled with hair-raising acts of courage and determination in the face of great odds.The only downside - the book is more focused on the military facts than the politics and personalities involved - it left me wanting more information regarding the lives & history of the people involved. Also, the book stops in 1982, so if you are curious on what's been happening in the last 20 years, you won't get it here.Overall, very good book and you will gain a thorough insight intothe Arab-Israeli wars."
4,An informative and well written book,"Chaim Herzog, a former Isreali president is suprisingly impartial in his detailed analysis of the Arab Isreali wars. His descriptions of battles and strategies are at times confusing for someone without a military background but it is an interesting read throughout and Herzog sheds a lot of light on the cause and effect of each war including the Palestinian problem.It includes moving accounts of extreme bravery and self sacrifice in battle and saddening accounts of the trajedy of war. You do not have to be a history or military scholar to enjoy this book. I would recommend it to anyone with even a passing interest in the turbulent history of Middle Eastern affairs."
1,Bizzare Orwellian tract,"In what is an astonishing example of Orwellian double-speak, this book for some reason refers to the Zionist colonisation of Palestine as a ""war of national liberation"". That's right, Zionist settlers (largely European) were ""liberating"" the land from those who deludedly thought of themselves as its inhabitants. Imagine if you will the laughter that would greet, say, the Germans referring to their invasion of Poland as a ""war of national liberation"" etc. This book is full of such meaningless and purely propagandistic language which serves only to conceal the truth. Sad."
2,Pedantic Emphasis on Details While Failing to Illustrate the Big Picture,"I read history for recreation. Unfortunately, the writing style of this book makes it difficult to read for recreation. I perceived that the author made very little attempt to focus on the important ideas that shaped Israeli history. Instead, he has produced a deluge of extensive detail that can get pretty overwhelming.This book may very well be appropriate for serious scholars of Israeli history who have a great idea of the essentials but want to flesh out the details. However, I definitely do not recommend this book for those who enjoy reading history for recreation. Instead, I recommend reading Michael Oren's books."
2,"No testing, and therefore a teaching failure","This book is very well written though is extremely dissappointing. The ideas behind the examples are good but there were so many errors in the code that my jaw dropped. The examples on the CD which correspond to the lessons have different code than in the book and the reason is because they wouldnt work if it was the same! Luckily i had previous actionscript knowledge so i could after some time troubleshoot them, but in the other technologies i have no previous experience and therefore do not know if what ive learned is correct. This book is ok for learning the thought processes behind the examples but not for learning the programming languages -which is the focus of the book. not recommended"
2,definitely for beginner,"This book is very well written, but most of contents are for beginner to intermediate who have basic actionscript skills. If you have already know CGI (such as php, perl, asp etc) and fairly understand action script, this might disappoint you."
1,A Waste of Time and Money,"I spent sixty dollars to get this ""great"" book, expecting to take my flashing to the advanced level. I received it from Amazon within a couple days which was fantastic, but as I opened the cover and read the preface I realized what a terrible waste of money it was. I'm sure the content is good and very useful but the problem is that it was written for WINDOWS and only WINDOWS. Nowhere on the cover or in Amazon's item description did it mention this. I wish the publishers and distributor realized that this might be an important bit of information to enlighten the consumer to; hopefully, they will do so in the future.If I was still a windows user, I might give this book a 5-star rating, but do to the critical lack of platform specification and the fact that the authors chose not to make the effort to accomidate developers on both major platforms, this book is only a waste of time and/or money for non-windows users."
4,"Good, but ........","If you have interest in the scrolls you should read this book. It will change your mind. On the other hand, it is a long and sometimes tedious account, filled with many details. I'm not saying that they are unimportant, I'm just warning the reader that much of the text is rather -- dry and academic."
4,Great Rap and at least he does it right,"Lil Bow wow is a great respectable rapper he brought being young to the scenario to his advantage. Instead of rapping about some of the stuff he doesn't have ""example:cars"" he rapped about stuff the pertains to him which I gotta give him props for and the last thing is he didn't take a Jackson 5 song which had some flavor, kill it and put his name on it with a cheap back up artist doing the jackson 5 vocals. I'm not saying any names but you all know who I am talking about. Great songs and rap and he's one of the best Lil's out there"
3,Books won't do it all,"Every book has some points or knowledge that will help us do better, but to expect a book by Vallejo or Michael Whelan to turn us into an artist of their caliber is asking a bit much. The most one can expect is to pick up some techniques or helpful hints. This isn't a bad book, it just can't be the book. The Artist's Manual, The Illustrator's Bible, and a variety of good artistic anatomy books are well worth the penny for even people who want to draw or paint in the Science Fiction or Fantasy mode. Keep in mind that good art is just that, good art, regardless of pigeonholing things into categories. A lot of us would like to just get the shortcut to no sweat greatness, but that usually is more of fantasy than anything else. Look at non-specialized technique books as well as ones with Science Fiction or Fantasy on the covers."
3,worth to read if you are a beginner in fantasy art,"an informative book to introduce what fantasy art is and the elements of fantasy art, for beginner only !"
3,Works but it is too long,"It works to clean my straws but it is much too long for my purpose, it doesn't fit in a regular drawer. I may find another use for it with the length of the stem so I'm not sorry that I bought it."
3,It's ok,"Bought to use with stainless steel straws, but it is too thick. It's 18"" long with only 1 1/4"" of hard bristles. Need to be careful inserting because end is hard metal and can scratch. Unless you have a really long straw or other tubing that needs to be cleaned it really is overkill."
2,I agree with previous critique about bristles,"I just received this straw washing brush in the mail, and I'm a bit disappointed. I should have listened to the other review that complained about the stiff bristles because they really are too stiff to clean plastic straws without severely scratching them. I was planning on using this brush for my reusable Starbucks straws, but I'm worried that this thing will destroy them. However, I think I might find other uses for this brush, such as cleaning the nooks and crannies in my cats' drinking fountain, which is made of a much harder plastic than Starbucks straws. Overall, great idea and perfect size and length, but the bristles are just too scratchy for softer plastics. Still looking for a similar product...."
2,Bristles are too stiff,The bristles on this brush are so stiff that they scratched the inside of my straw. This basically just creates new places for bacteria and debris to hide. Kind of defeats the purpose!The straw I used it on is a hard plastic...maybe polycarbonate or acrylic. It seems like wetting down the bristles and twisting the brush as you pull it through the straw may help reduce the scratching.
4,Sports Bottle Straw Washing Brush,"The brush cleans pretty good but only has about 2 inches worth of brush bristles at the end of the brush. Wished it had more, but otherwise its a good brush."
4,"Works, but be careful","Brush works as described, but be careful of tip. Sharp metal end that can puncture, especial that of the straw mouth piece of hydration bottle. Would recommend manufacture to add rubber tip."
5,Great for keeping the straws clean.,Just the right stiffness to give you the feel it is scraping any residue off the inside of the straw when washing.
4,Great invention!,"Works well, but is hard to store due to long metal handle. Like others have said, it could've used some more bristles and maybe even be more flexible, but it's a great product and good idea to get straws for my child squeaky clean!"
5,Fantastic Item!!!,Exactly what I needed to clean my Starbucks Venti straws I bought!!! Nifty item I can hang up!!! Recommended for anyone who needs to clean long straws!!! A+++++
3,No bristles on the tip end.,"If there were bristles on the very tip end I would have rated this 5 stars but the end tip is just a bare metal point. Yeah I know it's technically a brush for cleaning big straws, but why did the makers have to cut corners on something so simple as just a few extra bristles on the tip? I can't think of a good reason anyway and so I'm irritated that they messed up what could have been a good multipurpose brush. I haven't found a similar replacement yet so to scrub very tall narrow bottles like theseAquasana AQ-6000 27oz Glass Water Bottles (6-Pack)that baby bottle or other brushes are too short or too wide for I wrap a small cut out square piece of microfiber rag around the end of this brush and catch them on the bristles to make it stay and then use it. It works that way."
3,Cleans smoothie straws like a dream!,I didn't give it 5 stars because I think it's overpriced but it DOES work to clean out our plastic reusable smoothie straws.
2,Weak effort from the Keith Green Wanna-be,"Steve Camp has a great voice and a real ear for melody and lyrics, but this collection is just boring.It lacks musical passion and features an overproduced string section that simple takes the bite out of any of the lyrical contents.Steve always wanted to take up Keith Green's mantel of a ""Christian musical prophet"" but both of them fell into the ""law versus grace"" challenge and each chose the law, so neither was ever happy with his ""behavior"" before God.But Keith had the musical (piano) AND vocal chops to pull it off while Steve had to rely on his voice. Sadly, this mournful and ""put upon"" CD simply isn't interesting or challenging to listen to. And even when Steve covers Keith's ""Pledge My Head"" he deadens the impact.It sounds like Steve was simply depressed on this CD.Skip it and look for the two ""classic"" Steve Camp CDs -- ""Fire and Ice"" and ""Shake Me To Wake Me"" -- both power pop/rock from the 80s that have great riffs and lyrics."
2,Not big enough for a chin,The product showed up on time but the wheel is too narrow for a full grown Chinchilla. My pet can walk in the wheel but is unable to run because it is too narrow. Also the wheel showed up broken. I was able to fix the broken wire with epoxy but probably wont buy another one.
3,Not for chinchilla unless anorexic,It is 3 1/4 wide and the side supports are wide not the same as pictured. I am using it for rats or would be returning it.
1,Not what it appeared to be,This wheel was not extra large It is mid sized and the chinchilla does not fit on it. The wheels I have ordered in the past(for the same price) have been a full size bigger
3,Disappointed,The tapes were packaged as new but a few minutes into each one the video and audio became distorted. After a while it returned to normal play but it was very frustrating. As Survivor fans we enjoyed seeing how far the show has come since this first season.
3,The show is great... the technicals of the DVD are very crappy,"The series is great! but my complain is directed towards the technicals of the DVD, there aren't any subtitles, only the titles menu, and when you are in it you can't stop the DVD. It could be improved BIG time."
3,Everything not in package,All the Survivor discs were in the package. There is supposed to also be a bonus disc. When we opened that sleeve it was missing. I would have liked to know that before I purchased it.
5,The Beginning,Any Survivor fan that doesn't have this yet should have their head examined. The game was so different back then compared to now and it's fun to rewatch it and relive these old seasons. Some of the better contestants came out of Borneo too...
4,Where It All Began,"The first season of Survivor is so funny because these people came to the island without any semblance of strategy. They were appalled by the notion of ""alliance,"" and they didn't talk amongst each other about how they can work together to eliminate certain people. Richard Hatch thought to do this, and Richard Hatch won. Easily. Since then, the game has gotten far more complex, less about survival, and more about alliance-making. The downside to this season is definitely the lack of a strategy, but the upside is the focus on actual survival: obtaining food, boiling water, catching fish, dealing with the elements, . . . and this is what makes the season worth watching over and over."
5,Survivor - the Original Season,Purchased at same time as Survivor Africa. Both were delivered were on time and brand new - fully living up to the seller's commitments. We are enjoying both seasons.
5,YEAH!!,I WATCH ALL THE PAST SHOWS ON MY CRUDDY VHS TAPES BEFORE EACH SURVIVOR TO GET MYSELF BACK INTO THE GAME..IT IS WONDERFUL TO HAVE THE NEW SEASON FULLY...EVERYONE IN OUR SURVIVOR GROUP IS PUMPED!!!!
3,OK,"This season was OK only because a person who didn't deserve the money won it. Kelly should of won hands down. Why did the jury vote Rich? OK Sue, Rudy and Greg had a reason. Wait a minute, Greg did the number thing. So that means that Sue and Rudy had the only good reason voting for Rich and against Kelly. Otherwise the season was very good."
2,Snakes and rats.,"Survivors first season was classic TV. An original, unexpected trendsetter. Marc Burnett is a fantastic storyteller and the cast he selected is fantastic. Unfortunatly if you've already watched it on CBS watching it again is almost like watching old weather reports and frankly there isn't enough ""plot"" to sustain multiple viewings. The only reality show i'd probably buy is PARADISE HOTEL since it's format was more like a lightly scripted soap. As for Survivor all the media overkill has killed all joy in watching it more than once. EP"
5,Watched it non stop,"I was impressed by this set. I ordered it on the 26th and got it on the 30th(due to super save shipping it was cheap)I then watched it and could not stop after each episode. I onlytook breaks after 4 or 5 in a row. This is the one season I hadnever seen and am glad about my purchase. The back of the casesare bad though as they reveal too much info and the cases aresoooooooooooooooooo small but I can live with that. The videoquality is astounding, but the special features are prettyboring. The top 10 is okay and the LA to Borneo was useless.However this collection is great and further ones can only get better."
4,"Great, but Could Have Been Better","Being a huge Survivor fan, It's great to have this ground-breaking series on DVD. Even after you know what happens, it's still interesting to watch over and over. Included are commentary by Jeff Propst and some survivors as well as a highlights DVD with extra footage. I must say some interesting facts were revealed through both features. Unfortunately they fell short when it came to making this entire set uncensored, as the highlights DVD was. Instead you're only left with commentary for the first and last episodes to give you anything more revealing about what happened on the island. Giving more in depth information on the survivors would have also been a very nice feature, but it was left out. Maybe it will get better with the next series..."
4,Survivor - The Complete First Season,"This 5 disc series allowed me to relive those special moments from the first ""Survivor"". Clearly a Survivor fanatic, I enjoyed the commentary from Rudy, Jeff, Richard and Gervis on the first episode. I also liked the ""other"" moments that didn't make the TV screen the first time around.Because of the ease of ordering using Amazon.com, I'm thinking about ordering the Second Season: The Outback soon."
5,Survivor - The Complete First Season,I completely enjoyed watching it even though I have seen it before. The quality was very good. I recomend it.
1,Come on People ! ! !,"Survivor is the type of show that works only when first viewed.Granted the original Survivor was a great show.Are you serious though? You're actually going to watch it again?This DVD is DEFINITELY for first time viewers only.Who can enjoy a replaying of reality TV?Think about it, CBS will not air reruns of Survivor because no one will watch it.Follow their lead, don't buy this. If you never saw it, rent it."
3,Character,"The book is very good. I studied it carefully and the information was helpful. I had a bad experience with the seller, however as he sold me the same book I already had and refused to refund my money when I returned the book."
1,"1 star...c'mon, it's not out yet....","On the High Roller site they say that their in the process of ""dotting the i's and crossing the t's."" This goes for the next New England Metal and Hardcore Festival DVD. I think the wait will be less than 5 more years."
2,Better off with another mouse,"Normally I don't do reviews, however, this HP mouse has gotten on my last nerve! For some reason, the optics make the pointer ""jump"" sometimes when the system is ""thinking"". A lot of times I'll be playing a game, then suddenly it ""jumps"" to the corner (always a corner) and when I click it closes out the window! It happens constantly and I try to make sure that I know where the cursor (arrow) is before I click, but it shouldn't be that way. I'm currently looking for a non-optical mouse as I write this."
3,No for beginners,"Imagine a biography on George Washington that only mentioned his service in the American Revolution in passing references. Well, that's the style of Gustavus Adolphus the Great by Nils Ahnlund. He writes a biography of a great warrior king without ever delving into his military career or even his death (he was killed in battle). This book is clearly intended for someone who already knows a lot about the subject and is trying to study more technical aspects of his kingship and Sweden at the time. It is not for the layman who wants to know the basics of the Thirty Years War and Gustavus Adophus' role in it. After reading the book, I still feel like I need to go to Wikipedia to find out what exactly it is that he did and why he's so famous."
1,NON/ANTI/PSEUDO-Catholic Digest,"If you are looking for Catholic news, culture, spirituality, history, apologetics, liturgical updates, or DOCTRINE, THIS is certainly NOT the magazine for you.The articles featured in Cath.Dig. are HETERODOX (not orthodox), and stray -- in tendency or in explicit terms -- from the Magisterium of the Church.Anti-Christian Feminism, Homosexual Activism, and general Modernist Revisionism and a rebellious ""anti-Dogmalism"" pervade the pages of ""Catholic"" Digest, though often (but not always) with veiled language.For Catholics trying to get their faith straight, or Protestants and non-Catholics trying to find out more about what the Christian Faith is all about, STAY AWAY from this publication!!As a cleric and a pastor of the Flock of God, I strongly urge you NOT to purchase this magazine.The Rev. Enzo G. Selvaggi"
1,Manger Mafiosi,The Digest's cartoon in the December issue would be inappropriate in any magazine but in a Catholic magazine it borders on disgusting and blasphemous!!!L. Giarratano
3,"Provacative and a bit troublesome, but well worth reading.","I happened upon this book at a bargin table. What drew me into buying it, was not it's sexual content but instead it's reviews for being a book that will ""stimulate intellectual and moral questioning"". I found it very captivating and to some extent very disturbing, but enjoyable to read. A few of his analogies at each of the chapter beginings really hit home for me."
1,Garbage!,"I bought one of these a while back hoping to replace my ADS Tech. DVD Xpress. The only nice thing I can say about the Dazzle over the ADS tech box is that it acts like a webcam. However, it decides to randomly stop working and mess up all my USB ports. This is something the ADS one didn't do, when it happened to work. Basically, don't buy this thing. Its going into the garbage immediately."
3,Nun Bio During French Revolution,"WHITE WINGS AND BARRICADES by a Daughter of Charity is a biography of Sister Rosalie. Her life's journey as a Daughter of Charity took her to the poorest and disreputable sections of the city of Paris during the French Revolution. At 28 years of age she was made superior. Her work with the poor, orphaned, sickly and misunderstood was tireless. She established a pharmacy and a clothing distribution center. (Forshadowing a modern medical social service bureau and health dispensary.) her story is one of glory and many difficult moments as she ministered to ""her children"". Uplifting story of a courageous woman."
4,The Great Mary Lou,"Ask most people who love jazz about Mary Lou Williams and watch their eyebrows wrinkle. Mary who?? This woman lived through some very difficult eras and it is well worth reading her biography by Linda Dahl "" Morning Glory"". Mary Lou at Ricks Cafe American is an excellent example of hearing her live and I recommend this cd very much. Her cds are there to find so read about her first and then begin with the above cd. Others I would recommend are Zoning - The Zodiac Suite and the very special ' My Mama Pinned A Rose On Me'. Yes a great woman of jazz and Mary Lou should be as famous as Armstrong and Ellington as she often arranged for the Duke.Highly recommended. (ps. My four stars are because it is just below the three cds I have mentioned above.)"
4,2 movies for the price of 1! (one good and one just okay),"I remember watching ""Man In The Wilderness"" at the drive-in (yes, I'm old enough to have such a childhood memory) with my parents and then watching it here and there on TV when it made its way into the Saturday/Sunday movie staples rotation. It was good then and it's still good now. And, I just recently found out (read an article in a magazine) that it is based on a true story. Now I want to find that novel and ready it!And, then you get a 2nd Richard Harris movie, ""The Tracker"" that I had never previoulsy heard of (which surprised me because I'm a big movie buff and have seen thousands of movies in my 46 years). It's just okay. I melo dramatic in all aspects (writing, acting, directing...the wholeshebang), but as essentially a free bonus feature to go along with the first moive, it was fun to watch.All in all, a nice 2 for 1 deal!"
1,Order 2 but get 1,"The DVD contains only one movie ""Deadly Tracker"". But the movie ""man in the Wilderness is not in included in the DVD."
1,Man in the Wilderness /Deadly Tracker,"Poor I would not buy again. I found the loss of good English, and a little to much blood and no dialog worth repeating, I was disapointed."
5,Man In the Wilderness,I had to have a copy of this as it is a classic and I have seen it at least 8 times. Great for history buffs as it was based on a true story of Mr. Glass.
3,Wilderness 1 Trackers 0,"Since seeing, ""Man in the Wilderness"" in the theater many years ago, I put this film into the grouping of Harris' work in ""A Man Called Horse"" and its sequel. It is visually powerful with some rather interesting views of the horse drawn boat. The personal trial of Zachary Bass and the journey it made for him was excellently portrayed. It is a classic Richard Harris Beaver skin Western. Now ""Deadly Trackers is not even close to that quality. Made by West Germans, it attempts to be a Spaghetti Western. It tries to use the blood and gore to make it Spaghetti Western but fails to tell an interesting story. It has a heavy handed moral which is neutralized by the overdone revenge story. I was trying to get two good Richard Harris films, I got one."
2,movie,"man in the wilderness, this was great product, the condition was better than expected, rapid shipping, would not hesitate to purchase from this seller again.deadly trackers ---- wouldn't play as a movie, just in still pictures."
2,ONE ANNOYING WESTERN,"THE DEADLY TRACKERS is one annoying Western, and it's also very typical early 70s in that is downbeat only cause that was groovy at the time; Harris' kid and wife get killed in a grisley DEATH WISH--LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT fashion, but there's no happy ending that even those 2 had; at the end of THE DEADLY TRACKERS you'll want to have killed the director, as well as the evil-incarnate bad guys.MAN IN THE WILDERNESS, as every reviewer agrees, is better; kinda JERIMAH JOHNSON meets FITSCARALDO, with john huston's men dragging a ship (!) across the west, while a wounded Harris drags himself around.And, these two movies aren't on seperate discs, or one side---flip disc, in which you have to worry about scratching both sides."
2,"Walk a little faster, please","LEGO Creator is a very early attempt at making a LEGO Harry Potter game, but sadly, this one doesn't succeed. As I understand it, you collect all of the chocolate frogs in an area to unlock new levels, and there is also some LEGO building and Quidditch excursions. This is a very open-world game, which would be fine except for the fact that the character walks so slow. The one thing I did like a lot about this game was the fact that you can control any living thing, from Hogwarts students to birds in the sky. The graphics are a little glitchy no matter what perspective though. Does the game still hold up today? No, especially because there's a superior, more recent LEGO Harry Potter out there, so this game simply isn't worth the money."
5,Put this on your must read list,"Not only is this book full of valuable information , it is also an easy read. If you are a parent, but especially if you are the parent of an African American male, this book gives clear guidance as to what steps are necessary to promote academic success. Along with guidance on what to do, the book also provides help in identifying strategies to avoid certain obstacles particular to African American males."
2,Errata in this dictionary,"I was very disappointed in the dictionary. On page 502 within the blue box in the middleit has ""... träumen in ihrer Lieder ... this should be Liedern ( dative plural). Errata in other books are not so serious - but in a reference book, particularily a dictionary, a mistake like this calls into question the accuracy of the whole dictionary!!! I liked it otherwise but I feel if there is one such basic error there could be more. I have returned it to Amazon."
5,"Collins German Unabridged Dictionary, 7th Edition (Harpercollins Unabridged Dictionaries)","I have been able to find every word that I needed to find with this tome. It is big and heavy and not for toting but it is very thorough and easy to use. I like the examples too. All in all, a very nice reference book."
5,The Ultimate Source,"I generally use online German-English dictionaries as sources for looking up new German words while I'm performing my computer based interactive German language course. However, when these online sources give meanings that don't seem to make sense or apply (and this is becoming more apparent as my level of German language skills increase); then I refer to the Collins Unabridged German-English Dictionary, 5th Edition as the ultimate source that always has the word meaning and other helpful information that I'm looking for."
5,Fun toy,Had to get this toy for my little niece because it reminded me of the one I had when I was a little girl. She loved it! A+
5,One year and still going strong,"This is a favorite toy in our house. Purchased for christmas of 2011 and she still plays with it A LOT. Loves it, gallops with it, makes the sounds, runs around. It has lasted and will hopefully be here for a while longer."
3,Good toy for imaginative little girls,"I bought this for my daughter to use with her ""cowgirl"" Halloween costume two years ago. She's six now and still hauls it out fairly regularly; the other day she used it while pretending to be a ""princess superhero."" Good quality, old-fashioned toy, although we never were able to get the sound to work on ours (not that I necessarily considered that a drawback!)"
3,Broke after first play time - daughter loves the sound,"I purchased this toy for my 4 yr old daughter; she loves everything unicorn. While she likes it and loves the sound it makes, I am disappointed in the construction. The head part is wobbly, and after taking it for the first time to a friend's house, the stick came undone from the body. We have glued the stick back in place - hopefully it will stay this time. She has had this toy for only four days before the stick came out. If stick comes undone again, will have to return."
4,Love it!,"I bought this for my 4 year old daughter. It was her Santa gift on Christmas. She loves this thing. It was the perfect gift. The only ""down side"" was that the sound didn't work. I guess it was susposed to make horse sounds. I don't mind that it didn't work. Made my life a little easier! I would buy this again!"
4,By the book for the practice exams on the CD,"The book is alright, but like what many others have said buy the book for the CD. From my perspective the tests on the CD are the hardest around. That is a good thing for it prepares you for the hardest questions on the exams. Here are my results:-- Before Book/CD:Real Exam #1 490 (wasted my money)-- After Book/CD and studding like heck:Kaplan Test #1 530Kaplan Test #2 520Kaplan Test #3 510Power Prep #1 630Power Prep #2 620Real Exam #2 660 (worth buying the book/CD)"
2,Frustrating,"Because the GMAT is a CAT test, the software is one of the most important features of this book. Unfortuantely, the software is TERRIBLE. Questions have typos (are they even real GMAT questions?), the software is old and difficult to use, the structure of the program prevents reviewing certain test questions, ... the list goes on. While this book may be helpful on some level, there is no doubt that it is not worth its price. I have not used other companies' test prep materials yet (though I intend to after this experience), so I don't know if they are any better."
1,Lacking in Specifics,I'm the mom of a 29 weeker who weighed 1lb 10oz at birth. She barely tipped the scale at 4lbs on coming home two months later. I pumped breast milk while she was in the hospital and wanted to be able to breast feed when she came home. It was very difficult and I needed information on getting a preemie who's been bottle fed in the hospital to latch on. This book had general information but was no help with the specifics. It was a waste of money for me. It might be helpful for someone with a brand new preemie who is considering whether to try breastfeeding or not.
5,Was much needed... Thank you!,Our daughter was a preemie - these books came the day she was born or just after - she was in the NICU for 2 weeks after birth - read several books that I ordered on Amazon - they were all helpful and glad to see there are resources Moms can read when they know or find out they will have a baby in the NICU...
3,Helpful Read,"Although this is a thin book, it is helpful to get your bearings on how to breastfeed in the NICU. My main complaint is that it wasnt really long enough to address issues in depth, but it was a good first read."
3,"Helpful, but lacked one important topic","This book contains helpful information, but fails to talk about one important aspect of a premature baby. It does not address how to manage being separated from your baby while it is in the NICU. I would have appreciated a little more focus on getting and keeping your supply up when you must pump, and cannot feed on demand. Otherwise, a very fine little book."
2,Poor product reliability and customer service,"This is my 3rd palm pda. I had this one for less than 3 months before it completely died one day. This was 6 weeks ago and I have not yet received a replacement. The customer service is poor. They seem to have unmanageable manufacturing delays. The ship date continues to be quoted and moved out a week or two at a time. If you rely on the portability of your data, do not get this product. By the way, purchasing the additional warranty coverage from Palm has not helped my situation at all."
1,Nice.... if it worked!,"Me and my brother got each one Z72 in xmas and we basically have the same problems.At first I was very excited about this little thing and got my life around it quite fast using it as organizer, as a book reader with Palm/Acrobat reader, and as a messenger used in conjunction with my phone.Then, problems started and it got slow, continously crashed and needed a complete reset. As mentioned in other reviews changing for a new one did not solve the problem and if you thing the technical services in the US are slow with 8-10 weeks, try it in other countries.The screen of this device is very very delicate. I say too much for stylus input. My Palm got its screen shattered with no reason and my brother's seems to be ok but no input with the stylus is posible. Meaning other 4 full months in not covered by warranty service awaiting for both palms.I asked to the people in service about the delay and they said there was a line of 200+ palms waiting to be fixedNot cool"
2,Palm72 Camera doesnt work?,"My palm 72 arrived, I went to use the camera and the notes appeared instead of the camera display. I called palm they told me I had to do a hard reset. The problem was that each time I went to used the camera it went back to notes. I sent it back!!!"
2,I love the unit but ...,"I have the same problem with the paint peeling off of the unit.I sent mail to Palm and they told me to call a service number that could have a charge. More specifically:""Please note, support telephone calls are subject to a technical support fee of $25 per incident after 90 days from the date of purchase. However, if your call results in a Service Repair Order, or we are unable to resolve your issue, this fee will be waived. U.S. customers may also purchase the palmOne OnCall plan which provides a full year of telephone technical support. For more details about the palmOne OnCall plan, visit our web site at:""This made me very unhappy after the $$ I spent on the unit - almost $300!Very disappointed."
3,"Great step up, but physical design needed more thought","The Palm Zire 72 has come a long way since the Palm's early days. I love the speakers (yes, it's tinny, but no speaker is good at that size!), the camera (it's more relevant to have a wee camera in a palm than on mobile phones), the colour, the video recording capability, MP3 playback, plus the usual Palm functionality. Palm's always been great in terms of speed due to the Palm OS itself.One gripe I have is that the rubbery blue bits on the sides of the Zire 72 are already coming off only after about 2 months' usage! And I even use a PDA case to protect it! That sucks because now my Palm looks old and haggard due to the blue bits peeling off. It's a real pity PalmOne didn't think a little bit more about the design of this!"
3,The Zire 71 Was Better; 72 is unimpressive,"This maybe bias, but oh well. I had the zire 71 for almost a year, when my dog stepped on it and killed the LCD screen. I would have gotten a new Zire 71 but it was ""out of date"" and the stores no longer carried it so i was stuck with the 72. The camera in the 71 is better than the 72. The 72 has the voice recorder which is wonderful, but i'd really have the plug in the bottom so that i could plug in the the keyboard instead of a wireless one, which i never seem able to make work. I wouldnt recommend this product to anyone who enjoyed the 71's picture quality."
1,Poor customer service and broke,After 3 months the AC connection broke. I had to call India where I couldn't get any follow up. I sent it 2 weeks ago and still no word. The link that they sent me doesn't work so I can't track it.If I call technical support I'll be charged $25. I even have an extended warranty.I won't buy any other palm products.
3,Zire,"Well it is definitely packed with some good features, camera takes good picture, as long as there is plenty of light, mp3 player works great and sounds great through headphones, unlimited amount of software to use with this OS and easy to install!! However the screen on mine makes a slight humming noise, and even after putting a brand new battery in it, the battery life still does not last long at all, after continual use maybe 1 hour!! Otherwise, good size, good features, also did not care for the blue rubber crap, peeled all mine off, and it resembles the special edition model now!!"
1,Bad luck?,"I bought it a month ago and the case blue paint is already peeling off, to bad for a PalmOne product. It can be that I am the only one, but it happened."
1,Not Good,I had this thing for one week and the peeling started to come offI RECOMMEND THIS TO NOBODY
2,Problems w Audible Promotion,"Note that at this time, at the beginning of January, Audible does not appear to be answering its phones. Individuals interested in taking advantage of the Audible promotion may wish to confirm that Audible is providing customer service, is answering its phones, and gives customers the ability to do things like cancel the service pursuant to the terms of service.Oh, and the Zire 72 which I got through this promotion, had a battery problem so I had to return it and had to cancel the Audible subscription - but have not been able to get Audible on the phone."
1,i has 1 system error.,"I have palm T3, M500 and zire 72i find 1 system error at zire 72.if quick-unlock and auto-lock setuppalm doesn't work any more. must reset.let's do1. hard reset(becouse of installed application. anyway ok)2. setup quick-unlock (system -> pref -> security)3. setup auto-lock(after 1min)4. turn off palm5. waitting for 1 min.6. let's try turn on palmbut u naver turn on your palm.any button doesn't work.if u want to turn on your palm you must reset.i tested many zire 72 at staples, fry's and office depot.also same problem.so i return it"
2,centers for palmone,i live at egypt and my friend was at usa and he get with him pda palmone zire 72 but he get me it without charger and it hard to came back to usa to get charger i just asking about any where at egypt can i buy from it charger or any website i can get from it charger but pay at shipping plz really i hope to can get charger or i will not never use it ok thanks alot
5,Zire72 PDA,"This is a great product for taking along information, pictures, documents, etc. I'm rarely without it. I would suggest it for anyone who is on-the-go and needs information at his/her fingertips."
3,"Runs great, finish terrible","This is my third palm-type unit that I have used. The Zire 72 works great and is very easy to use. The camera feature is a nice plus, but will not produce great pictures. I strongly recommend a extra memory card, since it is easy to max out the unit. My biggest gripe is that the finish for the Zire 72 is terrible, paint started to flake off the edge within weeks of the purchase. Seeing that the unit is not cheap, I think this is inexcusable. The poor finish is the main reason I rated this unit only three stars. If you don't mind this negative, it is a nice middle of the road palm."
5,Must Have!,This is a must have for any psychiatrist's office or any student. It's BIG and costs a lot but it worth it. Even non-professionals can use and understand it.
3,Mostly O.K.,"I have had trouble with this player recognizing region 1 disks (2 so far). It is set up correctly but it just will not play a couple discs, claiming that they are the wrong region. The disks play fine in my PS3 Blu-ray player so it seems to be a problem with the Pioneer, or it's drivers. Other than that, it works fine with all other formats (DVD, CD)."
2,"Danger, Will Robinson, Danger!","Blu-Ray playback on the PC is not yet mature. Before you burn your hard-earned cash on this product, make sure you meet ALL of the hardware requirements. And even if you do, like myself, it still may not work!! The software that comes with this product, WinDVD 8 LE is at best still-born. It will work on one of my older PCs, but incredibly not on my fastest machine. It will not even load on my Q6600 Asus P5Q Pro 3GB RAM setup. Go figure. Ultimately, you will need to buy WinDVD 9 Plus or some other application. I cannot understand why you even have to buy this kind of software. It is only just to play a movie."
3,Blu-ray drive rushed into market,The drive does not work with computers with SB600 southbridge. You may have to flash the BIOS or get a external SATA controller (Ex.PROMISE SATA300 TX4) The list of supported motherboards provided by the Pioneer documentation is useless because they are so old that you will not be able to find them in the market. The WinDVD software has hardware detection code. You can only install into a computer with the Pioneer drive installed.
4,Works great but may require a bios setting change,Make sure this device is compatible with your computer BIOS before you buy it. The Serial ATA connection is fast but required a tweak to a setting or two to be recognized.
4,Strapless,An enchanting movie starring Blair Brown as an American doctor practicing in England. Brigette Fonda plays her younger sister. Hugh Laurie plays one of thedoctors she works with.
1,Pointless,"I have great respect for playwright David Hare, and I'm a big fan of Blair Brown (and Bridget Fonda too, for that matter), but despite the engaging performances of these two actresses, this movie goes nowhere, slowly. Bruno Ganz's character is too cryptic, and his performance too expressionless, to ever provide any suggestion of real love between the two leading characters. Ms. Brown plays a doctor who is smart enough to run from the altar once; but she later goes through with it just because her shiftless sister calls her a coward. Later, when he disappears and she starts paying off his gambling debts, she seems foolish, not loyal. Reviews of this film talk a lot about the political significance of the story and its commentary on Thatcherism and single women, but those writers must have gotten that mumbo-jumbo from a press release, 'cause it ain't on the screen."
1,brainless,"if watching paint dry is your idea of entertainment,this dog of a movie is for you.BORING,BORING,BORING!"
4,Un buen grupo de Northumbria,"Este album, así como el propio grupo Cùig, es un interesante referente de la buena música celta que también se hace en la región fronteriza de Northumbria (Norte de Inglaterra, influenciada por Escocia), en la que sin embargo apenas existen grupos o artistas de este género con la suficiente proyección y difusión internacional. Se trata de un album con predominio de los temas instrumentales, indicado para los que gustan de los sets concatenados de tonadas, con piezas de distinta procendencia (locales, escocesas, etc.) y un repertorio ampliado además con algún tema de fusión (blue-grass de raiz americana, etc). El sonido del grupo presenta un perfil análogo al de un grupo acústico irlandés o escocés, con matices característicos que recuerdan el folk inglés. Melodías ágiles y entretenidas en general, con algunas canciones netamente folk intercaladas. Un buen disco que, sin ser excepcional, resulta bastante atractivo."
2,"No bad, but not the quality it once was","I brought them as a wedding gift, and they are beautiful, i have some John Rocha waterford flutes myself so thought they would be a great gift, they are stunning to look at, but they are not crystal, there is no weight in them at all, and felt dissapointed that were not to the usual waterford quality, mext time i will spend the extra and get some john rocha ones"
3,Quiet Beauty,"I bought this set mostly for the little statue, but I like the book, it's full of lovely images of Kuan Yin. The statue itself is quite pretty. This would make a nice gift, or an addition to a home altar."
4,Hurray for Jeeves! :-),"I love all the Jeeves stories, and whilst this is not up there among my top five, it does stand out for me because as far as I remember, it is the only one in which Jeeves is actually rattled - only for a few seconds, but it really does happen!PG Wodehouse's books are brilliant and I would highly recommend them to anyone who...well, to anyone! Go read them, now if not sooner! :-)"
5,Makes a great gift,"I have purchased this magazine for 2 years for my sister. She loves it and will rant about the cute, clever ideas."
5,COUNTRY LIVING IS THE BEST MAGAZINE,"I love getting this magazine in the mail every month. There are so many interesting articles and I learn alot about new items and the items I've already got in my home. I've used the decorating and craft ideas many times and I was really impressed at how easy they were and the difference they made in my home. The recipes are are so great it's inspired me to want to cook. This magazine makes a great gift, all of my friends love it too."
2,Not what it used to be,"I had been a subscriber to Country Living for many years and used to love it. The older issues of Country Living were authentically country. Now, they might as well call the magazine Country Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous because those seem to be the only kinds of homes and people they feature. If that's the kind of stuff you like it's great but it's not me, which is why I canceled my subscription. If they ever bring the old Country Living back I'll renew."
1,What happened?,"I subscribed to this magazine as a gift for a friend and she received a notice stating that this magazine is no longer in publication. This is her FAVORITE magazine and now she is told that she will not get it? I'm confused. If anyone can enlighten us, I'd appreciate it!"
5,Finally ordered for myself!,"After reading this in all of my Doctor's offices, I finally bought this for myself to read at my leisure. It has such great items in it that I was contantly taking photos with my Iphone. Glad I did!"
1,Literally half as thick as before,"Not sure what's going on, but I'm cancelling my subscription to Country Living. Seems as though they can't get it together to produce the same quality or amount of content as before.The January and February (which arrived only 10 days apart) were both half as thick as previous years of issues. I had the thought they didn't have enough material and just split it up between the two months.Boo."
1,No longer a good magazine,"Have taken this magazine for many years but during the last year I end up throwing it out after one pass-through .....used to be charming; now it is weird and unappealing. The decor featured is mainly steam punk cum Edgar Allan Poe from-the-crypt with ghastly DIY projects, bad recipes and too much information about the editor and staff. It has lost its heart and soul. What's going on Hearst?"
5,Very good reading,I like the different projects and items you can buy - plus they give prices and online addresses. Overall I'm quite pleased with this magazine.
1,Missing the old CL,"I miss the old Country Living magazine. Seems like all the articles are about second homes in the country. To me, this is NOT country living!"
1,"Agree with other review, this magazine has gone down hill","Once a much better magazine, it has turned into nothing more than fads and monotony, often features the same people over again and is going down the drain. Does not remember what it was or why it started. Have subscribed for years and am ready to cancel."
3,new subscription,"I like the magazine so far, it is hard to do a review with something you have had for only 2 days. It is informative with excellent photographs. Articles are as I suspected when I subscribed. Keep up the good work."
4,Great ideas!,"There are lots of great articles on decorating, food and everything to make your home and life a little more energized. Lots of terrific tips, too, on new products/ ways to do things plus internet finds. I'm always excited to read the new issue!"
5,Did my subscription start with the Dec. issue? Because that is the first issue that I received?,"The magazine is great..I am just concerned because I found my copy in the neighbors mailbox while we were visiting one morning. I am afraid that i missed one of the issues. Also, I saw a country living that was a monthly issue. Are there two types of Country living?"
4,Auto renewal?,"Of course I will have to wait a year to see what happens but when I tried to cancel an auto renewal on another magazine, what a hassle! Will wait and see how this one goes."
3,Too Many Ads,"I used to like this magazine. However,it is so difficult now to find the text due to the ad-heavy format.I would pay more for a subscription and have a cleaner, less cluttered format."
5,Creative and Affordable Ideas,"This affordable magazine is worth every penny. I enjoy the recipes, the decorating ideas, the crafts, and the articles. I read it from cover to cover and save it to share with others and read again later."
2,Only an ad book now,"I used to love Country Living when it had content relative to ""country living"". Now it is so full of ads and minimal content, I can read anything relative while waiting in the check out line at the grocery store."
5,great magazine,I've taken the Country Living Magazinefor over 30 years and love it.Love the variety of things that it providesthe reader.
5,Ordered for my daughter,This is a great magazine and a great price. Just renewed for another year and she cannot wait to begin reading again!
2,Country Living,I have a print subscription to Country Living and enjoy it very much. When I tried to subscribe to the Kindle edition Amazon created a new print subscription. I alerted them about this problem when I began receiving two print editions each month last month. This month the same thing happened. I tried to cancel the Amazon subscription to no avail. I will never order another periodical from Amazon. Most print subscribers can view the kindle edition at no cost.
4,Used to love it!,"I HAVE SUBSCRIBED TO COUNTRY LIVING FROM THE BEGINNING. I STILL HAVE THE FIRST ISSUE. OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS HOWEVER, I HAVE BEEN DISSAPOINTED. IT SEEMS EVERY ISSUE A WHITE ROOM IS FEATURED. IT IS GETTING OLD REAL FAST. I WISH THEY WOULD FEATURE MORE ROOMS THAT HAVE COLOR.I ALSO WISH THEY WOULD MAKE IT EASIER TO CONTACT THEM IF YOU DON'T RECIEVE AN ISSUE. THAT SAID OVERALL IT IS A GREAT MAGAZINE AND I WILL CONTINUE TO SUBSCRIBE."
3,Design changes - hinderance or helpful?,"Halfway through my five dollar annual subscription (which I picked up here on a bargain day) Country Living changed their design to a larger format. They seemed to be trying to vamp up their image and the process is not yet settled.I do love their innovative craft/decor ideas, but I think they could do with more details within their articles/image sections. It seems that they are more interested in promoting products than in actually taking the time to make sure they work well and are thought out. All in all a good magazine, but its not going to replace my Domino mag obsession. Come back!"
5,A fun magazine,"This is relatively light reading. Don't expect detailed plans for how to implement any of the ideas shown. However, I usually get at least a couple good ideas of out each issue, and I look forward to recieving my issues in the mail. I prefer this magazine to Martha Stewart Living, which is more food-focused. Don't get me wrong - there are still plenty of food recipes in each issue of Country Living. However, it's a nice balance between articles on food, decor, DIY/crafts, flowers, and entertaining."
4,"Wonderful magazine for ""country"" enthusiasts !","This is a great resource for individuals that enjoy country furniture, motifs and anything that has a country flair. The writers that contribute are very diverse and informational about a wide variety of topics."
4,country living,this is a good magazine for anyone that likes the country theme and way of living its really good but you have to be into that
3,Country Living Magazine,"It's well done, but not up to the level of content found in the original version of this magazine. It's still worth reading, but I'd prefer more ""how to"" content and more emphasis on historical country living."
1,have not received yet,"I have not received this magazine at this time. Otherwise, I already know I like the magazine. wwwww wwww www"
2,Not happy with Country Living magazine,"I have been a long time subscriber to Country Living but the magazine has changed to the point that I know longer recognize it. I always looked forward to the beautiful pages showing homes decorated in ""country"" fashion. I know that the country look is not as it once was but neither should the magazine take on the modern look it now has."
2,"country living, great for ideas and inspiration.","Lots of lovely photos, great ideas, deco tips and food."
1,Country Living Magazine,"Have not received it yet!!! And I get a ""Brides"" magazine I never ordered I wonder if someone confused the 2 magazines on my order!!!"
3,A good book which could have been better,"If you are looking for an honest, non-ideological study of the Reagan administration, your search begins and ends with this book. The author scores points with the reader for his honesty and willingless to consider new facts. I think that his final conclusion - that Reagan was both politically and economically sucessful - is true. The author proves the first point completely but the second one only modestly. I would have preferred that Mr. Sloan provide a more completely analysis on the economic afffects of Reagonomics, but perhaps that isn't his specialty. In any event, this will probably be the best book you'll find on Reaganomics politically but hopefully, another book will take up the economic front more completely."
1,No sample cartoon,Why cant we see any cartoon? How can we know if this book is something we like or not? I am disappointed.
2,In the Kindle sample please show more than the cover!,"Seriously. In the sample all you get is the book cover and a meaningless page or two and the question ""well how did you like it"". Not funny. Would it hurt to show one cartoon? Hey you can remove the text if you got to be greedy. I am considering not buying this just because of the poor quality of the sample."
2,Not Choice Christie,"If you are the type of Agatha Christie fan who collects everything she ever wrote, ""The Harlequin Tea Set"" will be a cause for celebration. Six of the nine stories originally appeared in magazines and have never been collected before. I would say Dame Agatha made a wise decision to let these little critters languish between magazine covers.Most of the stories were written very early in her career and have a girlishly romantic flavor with almost no mystery. The one Hercule Poirot tale ""The Mystery of the Spanish Chest"" is a fair puzzle, but she enlarged on the theme more successfully in the full-length ""Baghdad Chest."" The will-o'-the wisp, Mr. Harley Quin, one of my least favorite Christie characters, appears in the title piece with a very elderly Mr. Satterhwaite.To savor Dame Agatha's really fine abilities as a short story writer, may I suggest the excellent ""The Thirteen Problems."" Give this one a pass.-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer"
3,OK--best for deep Agatha fans,Not her best work; but her not best work is better than most best works....
4,Awesome locks; wish the description were more detailed,"I love these locks, however, I didn't know until they arrived that the ""key"" isn't included in this set.Magnet Key and Holder by Kidco (contains 1 key and 1 key holder)You have to purchase it also in order for the locks to be engaged. Otherwise, for the quality these are the best, even if it could be more descriptive."
3,loved it when I could get it to stay on,Great product as long as you can get the pieces to stay where they are supposed to. They fall off unless you screw them in...at that price and having to ruin your cabs buy the cheapies!
2,Bet on the wrong horse,"I let my 1 year-old play with the magnet opener. I admit that was dumb and of course it went missing never to be seen again. The next day I went on a wild goose chase to Lowe's, Home Depot, Babies R Us, etc trying to find a retailer who carries this product. The only place that had anything was Babies R Us but they only had a four lock pack with no key. I asked an employee and she mentioned seeing their products on clearance lately and thought maybe they were being discontinued. However, the Safety 1st locks were available everywhere. Also, maybe my husband did a poor job on the install but I have two or three of these that flat out don't work."
4,great idea!,"great product. very easy to install. our cabinets are old and warped, so we needed to use the screws to firm up the cabinet part, but not the door part, which was perfect. we did all the bottom cabinets in our kitchen and bathroom in no time flat and its already holding up very well to our son's prying fingers and yanking hands."
2,Great for doors/such as under sink - do not work for drawers,"We purchased these for our kitchen cabinets. Unfortunately, they do not work at all for drawers. Both pieces are too long for adhering to front of drawer and top of drawer. We tried everything, even drilling them in - when we specifically bought them for the ""non-drilling"" option - and they still won't work.They, do however, work great on cabinet doors. So, I suppose we will use the rest we have a total of 10 locks for other cabinet doors in our home.Not sure what to do about our drawers in kitchen. They are custom, so I think it may be difficult to find anything that will work.Overall, if you are buying these for cabinet doors, they work excellent. But, I would not suggest purchasing them for cabinet drawers."
5,Recommend,These are great. Easy to install and easy to use. The nice thing is that they are easy to remove when no longer needed.
3,Doesn't work on sloppy cabinets!,"These are so easy to install, but make sure your cabinet doors are very solid first. Ours jiggle up and down a little bit and it would be very easy for our son to open them by pulling down even with the locks installed. I wish I had figured this out as I bought them months ago and they were quite expensive."
3,Good but needs better directions,"The first step of the directions should be to run the magnetic key over the area where you plan to adhere the hook. Hidden brads or brackets used to join the cabinet door panels can attract the magnet in the hook and hold the latch open. If you find the magnet attracted to the area where you plan to adhere the hook, choose a new location or you will get inconsistent or nonexistent latching.I also found the alignment tabs to be less than useful so I broke them off and did it by eye."
2,The KEY is sold seperately! WTH?,"I ordered this because I wanted something easy and no installation. It arrived and I am about to stick them on when I realize there is no key in the package. I then see in tiny print on the box, ""key sold seperatley""Ridiculous and frustrating! Beware if you order to also buy your seperate key!"
4,Best type out there but still hard,"These have stayed and worked the best out of all the other types out there, but still not the easiest to install. Have to get the placement just right. Ended up removing half of them and doing them again which meant I ad to either screw them in, or glue them since adhesive was ruined. Now that theyre in place though they've been great!"
1,returning these,We bought two of these sets and one of the starter sets and have been really disappointed. We installed the two from the starter set first. One was broken and wouldn't latch and the other had such a sensitive magnet in it the nails in our cabinet door caused the latch to be permanetly down so it wouldn't lock. We are not happy with these and will be returning the rest of them.
