2,Mild and laid-back movie about Barcelona couples,"A laid-back, very relaxed, subdued movie, never jolting or over-dramatic. Maybe TOO relaxed. Not the worst choice of a movie for a rainy day, though best accompanied by a bottle of wine or, if you prefer, some other central nervous system depressant. Unfortunately, I consumed coffee. Instead of the MPAA rating, movies should just tell you what to eat and drink before watching.Not much of moment really happens other than the indiscretions of several couples. I lost interest after an hour, but the thing just kept going on and on. A friend found it mildly interesting, so I listened off and on in the background, but nothing drew me back in. A yawner. No sexual/erotic/romantic fireworks."
5,I Lucked Out,"I bought this DVD in the hopes I would hear the group sing their hit songs in their entirety, and was pleasantly surprised. Draggin' The Line, Crimson and Clover, Crystal Blue Persuasion, Hanky Panky, Mony Mony, and, my favorite, I think We're Alone Now were all very well done. Other features include individual song commentary, full-length interviews, discography, and a biography. However, it was the full length renditions of their hit songs that get the five star rating from me. If this is what interests you, you will get your money's worth from this DVD."
5,About time Tommy James had a release,"Tommy James is way overdue to have a dvd out there. Too many hits, too popular to be forgotten about. He's not 18 anymore but he still can do a great show live unlike some artists who embarrass themselves trying to perform and only showing a shadow of what they once were. It's live and is he perfect? No, some tracks are right on the money, others you may here an occasional flat note, but he still rocks the crowd and the band sounds great too. Enjoy...."
1,I don't get it ? But you shouldn't get this either,"The DVD itself is great. Good video, great sound and a real sense that these guys are playing classic 60's rock with a modern touch. I loved it. BUTTTTTT $79 for a used one and $130 for new ? As Mr. McEnroe would say, you cannot be serious. Check out the TJ website for this same item. I won't disclose the price but let's just say, you'll be pleasantly surprised unless, of course, you already bought one of these. Then, I'll be happy to sell you a six-pack of beer to cry in......for $48. Hah, get it ?"
3,BUENA PARA ESCUCHAR UN PAR DE PIEZAS SOLAMENTE,"AL VER A TOMMY, ME PARECIO QUE HABIA RETROCEDIDO EN EL TIEMPOPOR LO MENOS UNOS 35 AÃ‘OS YA QUE DESDE HACE ESE TIEMPO MAS O MENOS QUE VENGO ESCUCHANDO CRIMSON AND CLOVER Y CRYSTAL BLUE PERSUASION,SIENDO ESTAS LAS PIEZAS QUE MAS ME HAN GUSTADO.NUNCA PENSE QUE PUDIERA VER UN DVD DE TOMMY JAMES, LA VERDADES DE QUE VALE LA PENA VERLO.TAMBIEN SE PUEDE UNO DELEITAR CON LA INTRODUCCION DE SONIDOMODERNO DE GUITARRAS EN ESTAS PIEZAS.QUE LO DISFRUTEN."
5,Dragonlance top 3,These books along with The Soulforge are by far the best in the Dragonlance saga. Maybe I am partial to Raistlin but I find that the character is one of the most interesting in all D&D; novels and the work that Weiss puts into him really pays off.And time travelling is always a plus !
1,Will appeal to children and the unimaginative,"I read a dragonlance series book written by Jean Rabe, and got these expecting far more than I got.The story is so predictable, so implausible, so ridiculous that I could barely force myself to finish each book. A halfway decent editor could have fixed so much in these books; clearly the authors expected to be paid by the quantity and not the quality of the words.I was continually disgusted and appalled from the first chapter. Intelligent readers will be insulted by the writing style. My only solace is that I bought these from a secondhand bookstore for a total cost of $6. Still, I would much rather have the $6 than the worthless literary trash it purchased."
5,Dragonlance Legends,Read it as a kid and it still stands as one of my favorites. The Chronicles are just foreplay. Legends is simply awsome.
2,Not as good as I expected,"This opener has received good reviews by others, however I cannot do the same. We have tried it on a few jars and it opened none of them. The gripper just slipped and held on to nothing. One jar was even easily open by hand without the gripper."
5,Best gadget I ever bought for opening bottles!,"For someone with weak hands this is one the most useful gadgets in my kitchen! It has now had two years of daily use and, of all the bottle opening gadgets I've had over the years, this is the best I've ever had. It only opens wide enough for bottle tops - not jars - but if this ever gets lost I will be buying another! Being small, it stores easily and still looks as good as the day I bought it!"
2,"Works well, but broke in half after about 1 1/2 years","I'm reviewing this product because I've had my eye on it to re-purchase since my first one broke in half at the pivot/rotation point at the top - and I just noticed they've raised the price from $8.99 to $11.39. So, at that price, no, I (probably) won't buy it again. It had worked very well on opening jars - if I remember correctly, it has a bit of rubber around the area that grabs the jar lid, so it hold on well and I could always open any jar (large and small). Crate and Barrel had these for $8.99 a few days ago. Not sure if I should give 2 or 3 stars. I'm giving 2. Message to manufacturers: Make quality products. When did everything have to be replaced every few years??"
3,Broken after little use 3 stars,"This thing is versatile but breaks easily. I bought one of these a year ago and mostly used to open jars, and today it just broke in to two pieces at the hinge. Hence 3 stars or else 4 stars...Product is made in China and has a weak plastic hinge. If only cheap hinge was rectified it will be good product."
2,NOT a multi opener,"I bought this for my dad who is handicap and has trouble griping and opening cans and other stuff. About the only thing you can use this is for a bottle opener and a tab opener. Even with the tab opener it is only good just to lift the tab high enough to help you grip it. The handle is wide to help my dad grip the opener. Can opener does not work at all, I tried several different sizes of cans and none would open."
3,I wish I'd saved my money,"Although I have tried to give this tool a fair chance, every time I use it I think, ""This is okay, but the _______ I always used did the job faster and more effectively."""
5,Best ever opener,The Progressive International 6-in-1 Multi Opener is the best kitchen gadget I have used in years. It opens almost every size bottle and jar including the ones with the push down and turn type caps. It's a wonderful aid in many household situations. I urge everyone to try one. It works easily and every time. So glad to have it.
3,disappointing,"I've had one of these for less than a year. Already the black rubbery stuff on the outside has started to crack, even though I don't think that part gets much stress. But that is not the main reason I am dissatisfied. I bought this jar opener because I was looking for something to open wide jars, for example my olive jars which are a little over 3 1/4 inches in diameter. I have small hands and have developed arthritis in my left thumb joint. I had hoped this item would grip the jar firmly enough that I wouldn't have to grip as hard as I do with the floppy type rubber jar openers. It has not helped and my thumb bothers me more than usual for several days after opening a jar of olives. The opener is OK for small jars, but with any jar wide enough that I have to use the large end for opening, it does not work easily. It is not very expensive, but the floppy all-rubber jar openers work just as well for me and cost less money."
1,The worse!!!,"I haven't been able to open any jar yet with this opener. I am so disappointed. I only keep it because my son can use it, but I don't have enough strength in my hands. I am so sorry that I didn't pay attention to the negative reviews. I had the One Touch Jar opener which was great, but it broke and I can't find another in the stores. From the reviews, the One Touch has a tendency to break after repeated use, so I won't waste money buying another if I have to keep replacing it. But America's Test Kitchen recommended the Swing Away Comfort Grip Jar Opener and I am going to try that. I looked at the reviews for that item and there are very few 1 star reviews. Keeping my fingers crossed that it lasts 20 to 30 years like other customers have said."
5,Must have in kitchen,"For me this is a must have in any kitchen, you can open any jar with this, even the big ones that other dont fit."
2,Hard to grip if you have painful joints,I liked the idea of a multi-purpose opener a lot but I had to return this item. I'm not able to squeeze the grips tight enough to open the jar due to joint pain. Looks like I'll need to try one mounted under the cabinet so I can use both hands to hold the jar.
2,Fantastic until it BROKE!,"I've really liked this jar opener. It's versatile enough to open many sizes of jars. However, the other day the rubber outside layer just snapped in two on one side. I was thinking/hoping this opener was an Oxo product -- lifetime warranty -- but unfortunately it isn't. And I see in these reviews that I'm not alone in the good-until-it-breaks category. Bummer!"
5,Fantastic tool,"I got this for a friend with arthritic hands. She absolutely loves it. I have had one for three years also because of my arthritis, and can't be without it. I now don't pass off a jar I can't open to someone who can. This opens it easily. I used to rip my hands on so-called screw off bottle caps. You can use the other end to either un-screw it or pop it off with the opener."
4,Opener,So far I've only used this opener once and it worked like a charm. The construction is very good and it should hold up for many years.
1,Poor design,"When I first saw this, I thought it was a pretty good design.When I actually went to use it on a 3.5"" jar cap, it broke. As much as it looks like the inside is made of metal, it is not. Only the bottle opener section is made of metal, the rest is all plastic.Will not buy another one."
2,difficult for arthritic hands,"This opener is helpful for smaller lids (great for vitamin, vinegar bottles etc) however, I can't open a wide jar lid as it slips around the rubber (especially if you have used it a while). Part of this is due to the loss of strength in my hands from arthritis. So, if you have a similar problem, I suggest you get an automatic opener or try a manual jar opener that mounts under the cabinet to give some extra torque. I am buying automatic jar opener today after spending 5 minutes attempting to unsuccessfully open a jar of salsa with this product and every other implement in my drawer."
5,an overlooked gem,"It really saddens me that with all the JUNK on the film market these days (including most of the so called ""comedies which rely chiefly on sex nudity and cheap jokes) this film has never made it to dvd. In fact, it's difficult to even track down a VHS copy. The acting, writing and everything else in this film shines (What ever happened to Tom Conti??) If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and find a copy. It's definitely a treat worth seeing."
5,Tom Conti is amazing,"Tom Conti is truly amazing in this under-rated, little-seen gem. Backed by the equally amazing Roberts Blossom (who has never given a better performance), this sweet and sad movie will keep you laughing right up to the tragic but inevitable conclusion. A Must See!"
2,A Not-So-Ultimate Frisbee,"The frisbee itself is good quality. It has a nice thickness, but no gripping for throws. The fact that it glows in the dark is convenient. However, when taken out in the rain, or becoming wet in any way, the design on the top begins to peel off, which is rather upsetting. Eventually I just peeled the whole thing off and began playing with a blank frisbee. It's still kinda cool but, overall, I'd say not worth the money when you can buy legitimate UPA frisbee for under $10."
4,Great toy!,"My son is 7 months old and enjoys this toy. He doesn't quite understand the idea of matching up the shapes yet, but the blocks are the perfect size for his little hands, and he loves to chew on them. We can always make him laugh when he puts the toys in the block and the cheerful music plays. Also, because we travel, the handle & compact nature of this toy make it especially good for trips."
3,Okay- but the price- too much,The blocks and sorter are well made. But the price tag- too much. I dont think both of my kids got $[...] out of this toy combined. We gave it to a friends with a baby and I hope she has 4 more - then maybe we will have gotten the money out of it.
4,Great Toy but Handle can be tricky,"I agree with a previous review. The handle has pinched our daughter's fingers several times. I wasn't sure what to do so I just tried to watch her more carefully while she was using. One day while my husband was home he saw her do it. He took the toy and using a screwdriver took the top apart and removed the handle. Once she is old enough (she is eight months now) to carry the toy around we will put the handle back on. Other then that, I love this toy. I also use this sorter for storage for her other PeekaBlocks and RollaRounds. I was disappointed though, that normal shaped rollarounds won't fit in the circle shape. Other then that, I think the shape sorter is a great idea for a traditional toy. Sarah also loves to hit it so the music starts. All around it's a great toy and educational."
5,Great shape sorter!!!!!!!,"I looked for a year for a shape sorter that was made well and simple. The others that I found were either cheap looking or to difficult for little fingers to do. This one is great. We already have lots of other peek a boo blocks and love them all. My 19 month old son mastered the shapes very quickly. (It was a Christmas present) He loves the fun sounds and the handle to carry around his blocks, and the colors and shapes are great for learning.The only thing that I would change is the square. It will only go in one way which can be difficult for children to understand."
2,Not the Best Shape Sorter,"Because this has a completely open top, my daughter only wants to put the shapes in there instead of the right holes. I also don't like that there are only 4 shapes when you can get sorters with a lot more. The ones with more shapes are obviously more educational. I won't deny that this toy is cute, but it plays unnecessary music. I would honestly just buy a different sorter."
4,This is a great starter toy,"I was trying to get my son to sort blocks and to notice different shapes. All the other toys were a bit complicated to start out. This one is great. It has four shapes , triangle, square, star, and circle. I started out with just two of the blocks and worked from there. After about a month I noticed that int he morning he grabbed the toy and turned it until he got the right shape. I put in the other two blocks and he really did not need much help.The one thing I would say I do not like about the toy is the sound. I would not waste your batteries on it. The sound if off and a lot of the time it makes noise for nothing.Overall great toy."
2,Hello...big open top!,"Like other reviewers, my child won't try to put the blocks in the right shaped holes because it's so easy just to put them in the wide open top. I'm really baffled at this design. Also, why must EVERY toy nowadays make sounds? Can't the child just be happy with herself for getting the block in the hole with no funny entertaining noises coming back at her? Oh wait,no they can't because they just put the blocks in the wide open top of the toy. Thankfully there's an off switch which I use all the time. This was a gift; I'd be mad if I spent $33 on this....I am wishing we had the $7 one."
5,Excellent toy,My daughter received this as a present when she was 8 months old and still plays with it daily at 18 months old!
4,Simple and fun,"My son is almost 8 months and enjoys this toy so far. He likes putting things (anything) in it and hearing the music. He's not sorting yet, but the opening at the top is big enough for him to drop the blocks in and pull them back out. He enjoys when we start putting the blocks through the correct shaped hole and he finishes pushing them through.The peek-a-blocks in general have been a little hard for him to hold, as they are *just* a little too big to grasp with one hand until recently. Since the sorting holes are on the sides, it is a little more challenging than the kind where all the holes are on top. They are fun, though!I like that it has a handle, and I look forward to seeing if he carries it around once he's walking."
3,Glad to see it on DVD,"This movie was download to PC only so I'm glad to see it on DVD. I haven't seen it yet but it has George Montgomery, a rather engaging western star. The Internet Movie Database (imdb.com) gives it a score of 6.2 out of 10, a decent score for imdb.Davy's nephew of the same name takes pioneers out west. Along the way they fight indians and a spy in their midst. Judging by imdb and other George Montgomery movies I've seen, I'll give it 3 stars. I'll change my review if necessary when I get the movie.Derek"
1,BORING,Bad not in a good way. This is not a movie it is a bad movie with COMMENTARY. If you want to see how a bad old cheep movie was made this is your thing. It may be watchable without the commentary .
3,Probably only for fans of Kari,"Slight disappointment because this is a single-track DVD, meaning no DVD menu or special features. There are also no chapters and you don't even get a time counter while the movie is playing!Technicalities aside, this is not a bad movie. (It's not amazingly good either.) This is Kari the action girl, and it's entertaining enough although the plot is simple. Leo Rossi and Jennifer Rubin(?) don't make great bad guys - more worrying than frightening. The movie is definitely low budget, but the effects aren't bad.Buy it if you love Kari like I do."
3,OK to watch once,"It's middle of the road. Yes, it's on a low budget, but the acting is fairly done. It could have been a lot worse. Kari Wuhrer carries the entire movie, the captain of the ship follows closely. The rest of the actors are just along for the ride.It's always interesting how a hot woman can overcome guys twice her size, get beat up, and not even bruise. ... Only in Hollywood.Anyway, it's a good watch for a scifi-action flick, even if you just watch (rent) it once."
1,Didn't get the movie only an empty case.,I would have liked it because I really like this movie but when I got the movie in the mail it was just an empty case so I returned it hoping I would get the movie but I still have not gotten it. I would still like to get the movie but I don't want to have to purchase it again because I already purchased it.
1,Owww my balls - PG,"Taking a cue from the movie Idiocracy, this is a PG version of Owww My Balls. Inane slapstick humor."
2,Bogus DVD,"My son, for whom this was a gift, pointed out this looks like a bogus DVD. Be wary of anything from this vendor -- looks like a bootleg DVD."
1,BOOOO!!!,"This movie is so bad it made me physically Ill. It made me weep for all mankind that this kind of garbage can get made. Of course this only refers to the first 20 minutes of the film,which is all I could stomach. Forcing your children to watch this filth is tantamount to child abuse."
3,Good family movie.,Good family movie. Good to watch at Christmas. Not a spectacular movie but good for sitting with kids. Not really for adults.
3,not enough info,"The unaccompanied minors movie wasn't in the condition I expected. It was specified as used but wasn't informing on the fact that it came with a busted up case that doesnt like to stay closed. However, the disc was fairly clean and almost completely without scratches."
5,Why Acts Matters,"The opening chapter, ""Why Acts? Why Now?"" should be read and absorbed by every American Christian struggling to make sense of the church's relationship to culture in the 21st century. In a few pages the authors explain ""American Christendom"" and, in a wonderful way, why its demise is cause for real hope. Acts is relevant again, and in it the church can rediscover its relevance as an authentic witness to the resurrection of Jesus Christ and his Kingdom. The partnership between Robinson and Wall provides a great balance of exegetical depth and pastoral practicality. Great for preaching preparation, and very accessible for lay readers."
3,Worked OK,"It does work to a certain extent. However, I still have some pots with carbon bronzed on the bottom that cannot be removed using this product. It also takes multiple coats and removals to get all the carbon off. I was expecting a bit better.Also, be careful of paints. Like the can warns, do not spray on to any painted surface. No joke, it will strip paint faster than paint varnish."
4,Works well for stainless steel pans,"Sprayed on my All Clad pan with lots of burnt carbon, left it overnight. The next morning, all the burnt-on falls off pretty much like bread crumb.The good thing is no scrubbing needed, you just need a dish cloth and wipe off the fallen carbon. Much easier than Bar Keeper's Friend.The bad thing is it smell pretty toxic when used. So if you are going to soak it, I suggest doing it in the bathroom and close the door. You don't want to do it in the open kitchen without ventilation. It's also a lot more expensive than Bar Keeper's Friend, so use it as the last ditch effort."
4,cleaner pan,"it has almost completely removed all the carbon on a large stainless pan, does not spray, but comes out in spirts and blobs, does not seem right."
2,Carbon Off Cleaner Not too good,"Product was advertised as spray on and baked on grease/oil will come off easily. The product helped some, but did not easily remove the baked on grease. I plan to try another product to see if it works better. Sprayed the baking pan, let it sit overnight and still had to use a lot of hard scrubbing to get the baked on grease to come off. Not all the blackened residue was removed."
4,Quality looks at a bargain price.,"I've purchased the Silverstars before, so I knew what to expect when I got them. For those of you wanting a bright white light without the high cost of a xenon headlight kit, or PIAA bulbs (which are top of the line), then silverstars are for you. A word of caution though - they don't last as long as normal or long-life halogens; but they look real nice on any car.If you're looking for a blue tinged light, or a yellow tinged light, this bulb isn;t for you. It's only for those who like the pure, bright white of efficiency."
2,Excellent Intensity bulb but don't expect it to last very long,"I would agree with other users. This is a great bulb but it does not last very long. Sure there are tons of variables that will affect the longetivity of the bulb but compared to an average halogen, this bulb will only last for about a year or less based upon my experience. Buy PIAA's if you can."
4,Very nice brightness,"I don't know why others gave this product bad reviews. It's a light bulb. They eventually burn out, I get it. The price is better here than any auto parts store and they work great. I bought these early last year and they still work great. Good purchase."
1,YUCKKKKKKKKKK!,"It is more like deconstructing.I can not beleive that GnR would allow this. This is a yuck fest! If you are a true (loyal) fan of GnR don't listen to it, it's a disgrace.Does Axl know about this?"
1,"Bad, really bad","Here is the premise of ""Appetite for Reconstruction"" (1999).All twelve songs from ""Appetite For Destruction"" have been re-recorded with original Guns N' Roses guitarist Tracci Gunns. The album features twelve singers--has-beens and also-rans, from the sunset strip scene. The songs are given a techno-industrial spin.Doesn't look good on paper? Well it sounds a lot worse than it looks. This CD SUCKS!!! It's unlistenable. The new interpretations don't work at all. The songs aren't intriguing or catchy, they're just ruined. This whole CD is a joke. If you are a fan of Guns N' Roses, you will get NOTHING, NADA, ZIP out of this CD."
1,Most insulting piece of dribble ever pressed to disc!,"This album is not worth the plastic it was pressed on (if I could give it negative 10 stars I would). I find this to be the most insulting piece of dribble ever pressed to disc! I don't know what they were thinking, but to make a rave/techno/""Electronica"" rendition of great Metal songs, sung by great Metal artists is the most insulting thing I have ever heard. I can't understand why great vocalists, like Kevin Dubrow, Kelly Hanson and Joe Leste would give their approval for such a cheap, sampled, mixed and remixed piece of electro crap. It's almost like the artist sang to the original GNR tracks, and then the mixers layered their vocals on top of their noise track without the artists even knowing. If I can't get my money back on this one (how about it Amazon!?), then It's going straight into the shredder."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS INSULT TO GUNS AND ROSES,"I rate myself as one of the most dedicated Guns and roses fans on the planet, in my opinion appetite for destruction, the origional guns album is the best rock album of all time. I have every gnr album, and video. I naturally rushed out to buy this and cannot believe how bad it is, it makes me cringe and feel embarassed to be part of the human race. It sounds like kids singing along to a play gnr on bontempi organ book for beginners. It is just quite awfull, I would buy anything else other than this album, its just a drinks coaster for me now. If you dont have the original Appetite for destruction, buy it now and enjoy the ultimate rock group, if you already own it, well you dont need many other albums do you !!"
4,A little different,"When I first saw this cd, I couldn't wait to listen to it. The orignal band is no longer together so they will never be another album like the orignal appetite, so I thought it would be nice to hear a different version of an album I can never get enough of. I was surprised when I put the CD on, being so anxious to get the cd I didn't bother to see that it was a remix cd. I was dissappointed at first, but after listening to it, I really liked it. It put a modern spin on a classic album. Maybe this is what the album would've had to sound like today for it to sell. Is it any different from the bands like Kid Rock, Orgy, and Powerman 5000. This is what modern hard rock sounds like today. So think of it as this generation's version of a great album. If I ever get tired of it I always have the original to rock out to."
1,Cannot be done,"Guns N Roses is one of those bands whose songs simply cannot be remade. Their style cannot be reproduce. They(Guns n Roses)on the other hand can make virtually any song better. The Spaghetti Incident is evidence of this statement. I agree with one of the people here that said Axl Rose and Slash are one of the best duos of all time. I believe Mr Rose's raw musical talent has been overlooked because of shallow people's petty interest in his personal life and his troubled ways. Slash is simply the most soulful musician I have ever heard with maybe the exception of Ludwig Van Beethoven. I have studied and am trained in classical music and have studied the great composers in music history(Beethoven,Mozart,Chopin,etc..) therefore I can appreciate the exceptional musical talent and deep emotion these two individuals put into their music, especially Mr. Rose. The songs on this tribute album should have never been made for you simply cannot remake any Guns n Roses song."
4,If you think this CD sucks,"Get out of the 80s. I, for one, do not want to hear an exact version of Guns N Roses tunes....if I wanted that, I would buy Appetite For Destruction again. This is more of a dance collection (techno..actually) and I think it turned out really good. Listen to KMFDM's remix of My Michelle.....its awesome. And you can not honestly tell me that Sweet Child O' Mine bears no resemblance to the original. If people had an open mind, they'd find that this is actually a damn good album."
4,Different could be good.,"Okay it's different but that's what G-N-R was when they came on the scene. Okay it's electronica but that's not the end of it. Some of it rocks and rocks hard enough for you to go back a listen to a track again, Listen to Paradise City and tell me Kory Clarke of Warrior Soul and Space-Age Playboys doesn't blow that song away! Give it a listen. Yes some song makes you wonder and are different but isn't that what you thought the first time you heard Guns-N-Roses?"
1,GARBAGE!! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!,"This recording is an utter piece of garbage. I've been a GNR fan since I was 14 (I'm 36 now) and I was really looking forward to a fresh interpretation of ""Appetite"". This thing is a mish mash of electronic/wanna-be dance music with really pitiful vocals. Really?? What a terrible disappointment. Save your money."
1,Spend the 15 Bucks on a haircut.,"I know how it feels to long for new GNR material. I consumed the ""Live Era"" CD's for about 2 weeks straight (they are awesome, by the way). As hungry as I am, however, I could not stomach most of the songs on this soon to be drink coaster (especially the Kevin Dubrow stuff... horrible). If you still rock, you will hate it too."
1,A Dud,"You would think for the price that this would be a valuable book. DO NOT waste your money. The ideas are just not very good. If you've been doing training for any length of time, you've seen them all."
2,Terror in Beverly Hills,"When your brother is Sly Stallone, how do you end up in garbage like this???? Saw this one on the late, late, late show while flipping the channels and only caught the tail-end. Only I couldn't find it on video, now after watching it I can see why!!! Frank Stallone isn't a bad actor in stuff that I seen him in before, Cameron Mitchell has done a lot of good low and high end movies and he and Frank do their best to save this movie! I couldn't figure out if Frank was a secret agent or cop and that's the big problem with this low budget film, it tries to cram way too much stuff into the plotline then it had for a budget. ""Terror in Beverly Hills"" gives the city a bad name!!!"
5,"dark, clever, and lovely","This album has been a constant in my life for about four years now...it certainly ranks highly on my ""favorites"" list. Jill Tracy is a wonderful songstress of a dark and macabre stripe who writes clever songs rife with vicious little tales of murder, poison, suicide, and morbid relationships. Her lyrics feature deft turns of phrase and *gasp* polysyllabic words indicating a grasp of the English language that is much stronger than your average musician. The presence of an X-chromosome and a piano would lead to easy comparisons to Tori Amos, and while I also enjoy Tori's music tremendously, Jill Tracy would appeal to more of a niche audience than would Tori. I'd recommend ""Diabolical Streak"" highly to those with a literary bent and a dark turn of mind."
2,Perplexingly tedious,"I like the sound, I like the mood, and I like the look. Jill Tracy has a nice style and the accompanying orchestra seems quite competent. Yet somehow this music, for me, is blander than silence. The lyrics, though superficially colorful, seem mostly aimless, and worse, the dynamics are utterly limp. These musicians are clearly skilled, but if they've put any passion onto this disc, then I must not know where to look for it. With one or two exceptions, every song has the same plodding tempo and modest intensity, straight through. I know these songs are about death, but that doesn't mean they have to be dreary. Case in point: the self-titled album by the Dresden Dolls, upon purchase of which Amazon prompted me to buy Diabolical Streak. That album has all the cleverness, sorrow, and life that this one lacks, and then some."
2,Pulling Your Eardrums Out,"My initial impression of this album is that it sounds campy as hell. Though the background music is actually pretty enjoyable, thus the 2 stars, but once Jill's voice saunters in, the blood-goth words that grate against the instrumentals come off as very cheesy and unconvincing. Actually, you could almost say that the vocals sound like a bad impression of Marylin Monroe. Almost.And though Jill and the Dresden Dolls are not exactly comparable, I currently have Dresden Dolls in my stereo, and given the choice, I would take the Dresden Dolls over Diabolical Streak every time."
4,Try your subtitles!,My mom's a Brit and I thought I could decode any dialect from the UK. But the combination of 1960's miking and mumbled slang make this a real chore. By turning on the subtitles I was able to uncover critical dialogue that likely has evaded viewers of this film for decades...give it a try.
4,Military injustice: a view from The Hill,"Sidney Lumet's film depicts the brutality inside a British military prison during the Second World War. ""The Hill"" is a searing indictment of the system. It is a hard-hitting film in every respect. Brilliantly acted by Sean Connery, and an excellent support cast, Lumet's film leaves the viewer with a sense of frustration and rage. Black-and-white photography and the absence of a musical score contribute to the film's effectiveness. This is one of the best films of the 1960s.DVD quality is good, although the sound is not great."
3,PRE FULL METAL JACKET,"22!!! years after this movie was released, stanley kubrick did a light version of it---FULL METAL JACKET; the first half of kubrick's vietnam war movie certainly isn't as powerful, or radical, as this 1965 movie involving british soldiers during ww2 being humilated by officers in a british military prison.The only bad part of this 2 hour movie is that it is based on a play, and has too much talking and yelling----which could also be said of sidney lumet's DOG DAY AFTERNOON. The visuals preety much amount to the prisoners having to run up and down a man-made hill for punishment.A terrific cast, including ossie davis having to put up with british racism----again, more powerful/radical, in 1965 than FULL METAL JACKET in 1987 with its african-american soldier nick-named ""snowball.""Kubrick never made an anti-british movie, and though he made a mint from CLOCKWORK ORANGE in the early 70s, he didn't make a vietnam war movie till everybody else had made one."
3,Brutal WW2 British Drama,"The name of this movie is ""The Hill"" and it refers to a hill of sand and rock the ""prisoners"" of a British Army Penal Camp are forced to build and climb in the hot North African sun. Stars Sean Connery as one of the prisoners who is sent to the camp to improve his attitude. So-so film but can be interesting in places. It's a test of wills between prisoners and guards and the film shows what can happen to a soldier who bucks the system. Brutal guards who have the British Army on their side vs. prisoners who hate war, the army, and just want to go home."
3,Futuro Ankle brace,Great price compared to some of the other ones. Not much help until swelling goes down and pain becomes tolerable so you can put weight foot. Effective at stabilizing weak or recovering ankle. Support for walking and most light activities. The side stabilizers have minimal padding. They can bruise bony knobs and any hard surface of your foot. Recommend you always wear socks and add some kind of padding. Use one that is pliable and distributes pressure such as gel pads and foam inner sole material.
5,Great accessory for the active person!,I bought this for my strained ankle as a result of a tennis incident. I am very pleased with the support it provides and it was very economical. In fact I sold the additional unit to a friend.I highly recommend this product!
3,Not for avid basketball players,"This product fits very comfortable and provides adequate support for hiking or playing casual sports. However, this products does not provide enough lateral bracing to prevent ankle sprains when playing basketball. I have suffered from a couple of sprains in the past and bought this this preempt further ankle injuries. Unfortunately, I fell on someone's shoe while coming down with a rebound and twisted my ankle while wearing this device. It did little to mitigate the effects of the sprain. It took me quite some time to recover. From this, I gather that a stiffer brace would be better for people that intend to play sports."
3,Decent,"This is a decent brace for every day usage or healed ankles for an added bit of support. But this brace didn't give me enough support to play indoor soccer with a sprained ankle, I had to buy the brace w/ the laces AND the straps, it worked much better and is actually much more comfortable."
1,worked well for a month,"Hitachi CJ110MV 5.8 Amp Top Handle Variable Speed Jig SawSaw felt balanced and worked well for about, oh, ten hours. Then the assembly that holds the blade fell out. Of course, it was attached by screws which had long since shaken loose. Even if I could have found them, they would be incredibly difficult to reattach.In addition, their ""keyless"" blade system is tricky to use and does, in fact, not last for more than say, ten hours of work. I usually expect more of Hitachi tools. They must have been asleep when they designed this one."
3,Blade falls out,"This is a great Jig Saw except for the fact that the blade falls out during a cut. This is especially true when cutting a circular pattern. Also, the blades are hard to get and I find them only on-line."
4,check around,"Haven't used yet, but I just got mine for seventy seven at the big blue place this afternoon."
1,"THIS IS A REVIEW OF ""mrplayboy714"" ^^^","What a sucka, this cd is good but the CaPiToLs from the above review got to go!"
3,Audio problems,"I was very anxious to view this DVD, having had the great fortune to take refuge with His Holiness, the Sixteenth Karmapa. However, my viewing was marred by problems with the audio on the DVD: in several places, there was no sound during voice-overs and interviews. I am ordering a replacement, but I am wondering if anyone else experienced this problem or if it was simply a problem with the copy I purchased."
5,The Karmapa's brilliant silver light,This is a wonderful film about about the transitioning of great teachings from Tibet to the West. Not only does it capture the lofty reverence which the Karmapa so inspired but also a sense of the urgent need for us all to generate kindness and compassion in this life. His Holiness emanates such brilliance in living the dharma and this is profoundly accessible here. I wondered how much more we could achieve if we could improve our focus like the many wonderful lamas in this beautiful film. Their suffering in Tibet and the joy which they emanate can only be reconciled with an appreciation of the buddhadharma which can only increase as we view this material. Namaste
5,very moving,"This is a very moving and beautifully researched film about His Holiness the Sixteenth Karmapa, especially for all those, who did not have the good fortune to meet Him. It is also very timely, since His Holiness the Seventeenth Karmapa Orgyen Trinley Dorje has visited the USA for the first time in 2009 and is about to visit Europe in June 2010."
1,to have a camcorder is not enough,"This documentary proves that to have a camcorder, good will and a good subject is not enough to make an interesting movie. Poor menu, boring montage, endless slide show and dull narration. Only for devoted."
4,this is beyond words,some of the footage on this video is priceless. my only Quibble is that it includes no footage of Lama Ole Nydahl. He has been the most active in spreading the Karma Kagyu teachings in Western countries. in previews there promised to be footage of him but none showed up in the final version.
3,It's an ok game.,I bought this knowing there was something not right with it. About the third misson in the game you are made to do something impossible. I want say what but lets just say I tried everying and I'm a little peeved. Well the game might be fun against a human but I cant seem to beat the comp on skrimage. Anyhoo I wouldn't recomend to go jump and buy this untill you've read what acouple of people think.
3,Ok in a pinch and for specific seats,"These stick in place seats are a great concept, however they were hard to use in public bathrooms, etc. It took way more time to get it on the seat versus the standard and then, disposal was an issue. The tape was ultra sticky and was hard to remove at times. Again - I love the concept or I wouldn't have purchased them. I just think it needs to be tweeked a bit. I'll still use them as they are much thicker and more ""cushy"" than the basic paper."
2,not useful,"Our son loves Dora but he didn't like the crinkling sound. He refused to sit on this, but he sits on the seat just fine without the topper. Topper not useful for us."
4,Very good product. Sometimes tricky with peeling sticker...,"Recently we visited India and taken this product with us. It was VERY useful. The material is not the flimsy one that you get in mall bathrooms but a strong vinyl. Very durable, The only complaint that I have it that sometimes it is difficult to peel of the sticker to expose adhesive spots. And of course my kids love Dora!!"
5,this woman is brilliant,"nancy wilson is one of the greatest singers alive.idont often right reviews but the only one was thisLee eng kong. this concert captures the essenceof a remarkable artist who while yes mannered,has an approach that is all her own. do urself a favor and see for yourself."
2,Growlin' Her Way Thru The Songs,"Nancy Wilson is a beautiful woman. From her early cds on Capitol, I know she has a wonderful voice. Somewhere in the 80s, she suddenly became a very mannered singer and all the bad points are on ample display in this short concert. Why must she insist on growling her way through her songs just to sound bluesy? This results in a contorted exxpression on her face all the time. By the time this concert was staged, she has lost some of her vocal range. To compensate, she has resorted to weird phrasing in all the songs. Her hits are here but unrecognisable in the mess. In stark contrast, her Grammy-winning cd RSVP shows her in excellent voice and back to her 60s roots. Let's hope for a better concert in her next dvd if there is one."
3,A Little Disappointed,"I have been a fan of Nancy Wilson's for the past 30+ years. My aunt actually introduced me to her music when I was a teenager. I am now 51 years old. I am originally from Washington, D.C. where Nancy typically performs at Blues Alley. Her voice, of course, is spectacular and none can compare to her style or possess her sultry tones. She is by far the most unique jazz vocalist of the century. However, there were rumors about Nancy's substance abuse problems during the sixties. What I saw in the DVD of her performance at Blues Alley made me suspect whether there was some actual validity to the rumors. Substance abuse and the music industry historically have not been strangers to each other; however, I had hoped that the rumors were untrue about my favorite jazz vocalist. I would hate to see such talent overshadowed by self-destructive behavior."
5,very on Point Book,Music related Industry Books always move me alot. this Book is no Exception to the rule.very detailed about the Politics.and you get hints at various Isms. selling you on a Dream but who is gonna cash the long term check? very well written&very direct&to the point.the book leaves no street unturned&takes it's own path.Black Artemis is the truth Fo SHO!!!!!
4,Not all the birds of Mexico,Although this book is up to Peterson standards it only contains the birds in Mexico not found in the North American guide. For example this book contains no shore birds. If you are out bird watching in Mexico you will need to bring both books.
3,One glaring omission,"This book describes birds of Mexico in the usual annoying Peterson format - decription on one page, illustration on another. The illustrations and descriptions are good, and for birds of Mexico, there are only a couple other guides to choose from. Two problems:1. Mexican birds that are covered in Peterson's guides to the birds of North America, or the guide to birds of Texas, are not illustrated. You'll have to bring at least one other book.2. Really glaring omission: no mention of the Spanish names of the birds! Did Peterson really think we would do all our Mexican birding from the north bank of the Rio Grande, with a really good spotting scope? (The Spanish names of the birds can be found on the website of the Museo de las Aves)"
2,Not Worthy of the Name,"I love Peterson's Guides, but the birds of Mexico is severely lacking. The art certainly holds up to the standard set by the guides to North America, but unfortunately, it can only be considered complete if you tag along two other Peterson Guides. Perhaps a good addition if you wish to complete your collection of Peterson Guides, but otherwise, buy Howell's or Edward's Guides, both of which far outshine this guide when considered alone. Howell's is certainly the most complete, but Edward's guide is a bit handier in the field."
3,Book Fair- Binding Terrible,"The color plates are well executed but they all fell out because the paperback binding is glued in, not sewn. Other owners of this guide have had the same problem. I was surprised because I love many of the Peterson Guides, but this book was not the least bit durable. Eventually, the book became a liability and I didn't bother carrying it. I was angry and Houghton Mifflin sent me a new copy when I complained. My friend had, ""A Guide to Birds of Mexico and Northern Central America"" by Howell and Webb. It was far superior. It was much more detailed and had range maps which were very helpful. It's only problem was its weight.I strongly recommend you look at the Howell and Webb if you are serious about identifying birds in Mexico."
2,An unpleasant surprise,"I assumed any Peterson guide would be good enough to provide a solid field reference. This was an unpleasant surprise -- it is well short of the mark. For starters, approximately a sixth of the book was bound upside down. (I did not have enough time before my trip to return it.) Next, the number of plates seems particularly limited and, finally, the number of birds covered seems far too limited. The first two entries I went to while in the field irritatingly simply referenced other Peterson guides with no further detail. Note to publisher: this diminishes the Peterson brand."
2,Mediocre guide to Mexican birds,"Not very well bound, not comprehensive and not as well illustrated as other Peterson guides."
2,Disappointing,"I live in the state of Guanajuato, and this book helped me to identify only 1 bird of the hundreds i was seeing in the area. It left me frustrated and disappointed. All birds shared with the United States and Canada are to be found in a different guide, which you wont be able to buy in mexico, so bring one with you. I have recently started using ""A Field Guide to the Birds of Mexico and Adjacent Areas"" by Ernest Preston Edwards, and have been able to identify every single bird i have come across since. Altho i like it much more than the Peterson Guide, i do find the write ups lacking.. the bird song is completely omitted, which you will be able to find in the Peterson guide. From my personal experience i feel that a few guides are needed to properly identify, and learn about the birds one will be seeing in Mexico. I am looking forward to finding a complete book one day, to save me lugging around three."
1,agree with other reviewer that this book is useless,"As below, this book does not include birds in the other peterson guides. Far better books are out there."
5,birds of mexico,Exelent book and excellent price. Shipper was prompt and have only praise for their service
2,Can't You Use Modern Technology on This Product!?,"I bought this DVD for the 2nd time (as I already own a copy) expecting that these distributors would have at least used a LITTLE more up to date polishing of the viewing quality. IT'S WORSE THAN THE OLDER ONE I ALREADY OWN! I LOVED this film at the show when it came out in the '70's. But for the small screen, whoever released it on DVD didn't bother to clean up the image. The picture quality and the sound are TERRIBLE on this DVD. The cover is more up to date, but trying to watch this DVD is like looking at a REALLY bad bootleg copy. I'm sorry, I love this movie, but this DVD of ""Chinese Hercules"" just can't be recommended due to the VERY BAD viewing quality. You'd probably be better off searching for a VHS movie for this product."
3,History of the Fender Guitar,"This is not really an instructinal DVD it is more of a history lesson about the Fender Stratocaster Guitar and its rise from the early 50's to today.Tom Kolb explains such mundane things as the Bridge section of the guitar and control knobs, tremelo,pickup's...ect.But the highlite is when he plays in different styles such as Jeff beck, Eric Clapton,Ritche Blackmore,and other great Strat players.Fun to watch if you are a huge Strat fan like me... but may bore others who were hopping to glean some riff's off of this DVD.After watching this dvd you do realize just how important the Strat has been to Rock and music in general.Its the only true example i can think of where they got something right the first time! the body and structure of the Srtat has not changed in 60 years....thats beacause it was perfect to begin with."
1,Looks great but DON'T BUY,"Immediately I loved the looks and idea of this can opener. I bought it just prior to moving overseas. After about 3 weeks of use, the magnet fell off the cutting assembly - it took THREE applications of superglue to get it to stay back on. The opener is difficult to attach to cans - you have to fiddle with it several times. The cutting assembly is removeable for washing...sounds great...but it falls off easily, usually while you are trying to attach to a can. ...I have lost some faith in Black and Decker."
1,Terrible Black & Decker support!,"Black & Decker goes to great lengths to detail about how to dispose of it when the battery has worn out - BUT THERE ARE NO REPLACEMENTS AT ANY OF THE CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBERS, THEIR PARTS & SERVICE LOCATIONS, OR AT THEIR OWN STORES! The battery is an unusual one and is not offered on any web site. Their solution? Toss it and buy another. Lousy planning and environmentally negligent."
1,Works great IF you can get it started,Getting this opener positioned properly on the can is very difficult. The cutter blade must be lifted but once it has been lifted the whole assembly can slide out and fall off. Getting the opener positioned so that the cutter blade pierces the can requires a real juggling act. Once you get it positioned correctly it sort of falls into place and away it goes. Unfortunately I find myself reaching for the old faithful mechanical opener most of the time because I don't like fighting with this beast. I recommend giving it a pass.
1,Great but doesn't work for very long,"Loved this thing the moment I found it. There isn't another cordless can opener, that I have found, on the market. Unfortunately, it only works for a few months then it conks out and I had to exchange it for another one. Same thing happened to can opener #2 so I just returned it and got a can opener w/ a cord."
3,Interesting but not Compelling,"Any reader seeking solid evidence suggestive of reincarnation in this book is likely to turn the last page disappointed. In contrast to Stevenson's other works in this area, many of the cases in this volume are frankly not worth the paper they are printed on. One wonders why Stevenson bothers to spend so much time and effort trying to verify them. He also appears to interpret a great deal of the purported evidence rather generously, and the readiness with which he gives away the benefit of the doubt to strengthen the cases is really quite alarming. Again, this is in contrast to his other works featuring cases from cultures where belief in reincarnation is common.By all means, read this out of curiosity or interest, and the last case featured is full of colour and mystery, but as Stevenson finally admits in the closing pages, these are not the most compelling cases of his remarkable career."
2,"Great concept, but.....","This is a great idea, but it just doesn't work that well. The pendulum gets stuck in the down position and it just stops counting steps. I work on a university campus and I walk all over during the day, but by the end of the day it had only counted about 10 steps. Also, the clip doesn't work very well. It can fall off very easily and then you could end up losing it. The menus are easy to understand. The different ""characters"" that you can pick from to encourage you are pretty cheesy, but they're not bad.Maybe I got a dud, but I've been pretty disappointed in it. I've had mine for 5-6 months and I have yet to get anywhere close to an accurate count on it."
3,Bette chews the scenery,"One of the later, more obscure movies in the Bette Davis catalogue, The Anniversary is based on a play and is rather static visually as a result. Davis plays a bitch-on-wheels matriarch whose verbal viciousness keeps her adult children cowering. While the supporting characters are not particularly well drawn, this is a wonderful flick to watch if you're a Miss D fan or someone dreading the torment of dinner with a parent from hell. Believe me, your own parental units will look cherubic by comparison to the eyepatched Bette Davis!"
3,Different,"This is a rather bizarre movie all the way around. Bette Davis, as always, rises to the challenge. She is an overbearing mother who rules her brood with a twisted sense of humor. It is an english movie, which I very much enjoy. It is a must see for any Bette Davis fan."
2,miss davis poison movie,only for miss davis fans because the movie is not great is far from the good old histories and curriculm of bette!only the costumes are nice and the cover eye!!!!
1,double check what you need,I usually have great luck with viking! But I used the configurator to get the correct memory for my ibook- and this memory would not be it. I did not know I got the wrong memory until after it arrived-- good memory usually- but please double check what you need- and do not trust the configurator.
5,Great buy,"This kit is a great buy. The sterilizer is very convenient. It was the main reason I bought this after I had a dome cap melted in boiling water. :)The pump is great, too. I'm a full time mom and have a Medela Pump-In-Style Advance. But Isis pump is more comfortable and as efficient. Especially good for pumping while nursing.And I don't have to talk about the bottles. They are one of the top rated bottles in the market. I highly recommend to any nursing mom."
5,Nursed two years and used these products,"I used avent with my daughter and never had a problem with the bottles, nipples, or the isis pump. The pump works great and if you need a little while to get the hang of it, you might try pumping on one side while the baby is nursing on the other - sometimes this gives a more productive let down. I found it all easy to use and the slow flow of these bottles was very compatible with nursing. My daughter never supplemented and I found the quality of all these products great. The sterilizer is super convenient and fast. I read someone say that this product causes nipple confusion and the truth is that was not in my experience at all. Additionally these bottles are easier to clean that most and the conversion kits to sippy cup type tops is fantastic."
5,Too Blessed to Be Stressed,"This book is on the mark for anyone not just women who are moving at a very fast pace and need to find peace and comfort in their daily lives. The Prayer of page 12, I call ""The Stress Reliever's Prayer"" is very powerful and has been of great comfort to everyone I have shared it with.Dr. Cook's approach to women of the Bible brought them in to the ""sisterhood"" of my life like I have never understood before. I highly recommend this book at a training I do on stress management called ""Are you too stressed to be blessed?""For me personally, the book has been a great source of peace and comfort and a guide to seek and trust in God. Once reading it and not all at one time, I recommed her other book, SisterStrength as a companion to TBTBS. She indeed takes you on a personal journey to find less stress and more peace in your life. If you are seeking to manage the stress in your life this is a good investment to start with. TDBS"
5,A celebration of Healing and Praise!,"Too Blessed to Be Stressed found me on the first pages of the book and ministered to my spirit throughout. Often we get so caught up in the drama that we lose sight of the choices we make that create our scenarios. I found myself humming me back to a centered wholeness and peace that I don't want to let go. Dr. Suzan Johnson Cook, thank you for this wonderful work. It has certainly blessed my life and the lives of my Sisterfriends!"
4,artist journaling,"This is a marvelous book for anyone aspiring to do an artist's journal. The examples and instructions are clear and doable, and it covers a wide range of ideas and examples. Since each section is relatively short, feeling inspired and excited just naturally follows."
4,A Great Book to Inspire and Start With; Especially for Students,"When I was fifteen, I was studying visual arts at a higher IB level. Part of the requirements for this was keeping an idea sketchbook, and the books of cartoon doodles I had wasn't really acceptable. Luckily for me, my professor had this book.Each page is absolutely dynamic - bright colours, really lively well-designed pages, a variety of styles, and quite a few instructions. It hadn't occurred to me before this book that sketchbooks were not necessarily all-graphite studies. I was absolutely captivated, and it opened up a whole new host of ideas for me about the potential for artistic journals and mixed-media techniques. I loved browsing through this book, and ended up buying my own copy.I find that I don't look back on is much as I used to, so this isn't for the experienced artist. But for someone just starting out, it was an invaluable resource and I'm grateful for it."
4,CREATING,"THIS IS A GOOD BOOK AND FULL OF IDEAS FOR MY USE. I HAVE SCANNED THE BOOK, BUT NEED TO HAVE THE TIME TO GO MORE INDEPTH."
3,Disturbed,"OK, so I'm not a book artist, but I am a journal-keeper. I was hoping for real journal information--idea development--and what I found was slick, finished pages that took HOURS of time. Lots of tricks, no process. Heck, if you're going to put that much work into a journal, why not sell? And if you have that much time to put into a journal AND make art for sale, you have a WHOLE lot more time than I do.It's a pretty book. Lots of eye candy. A bit bouncy in the text--try this! and this! and this! and this other thing! and you'll find yourself! but there are no rules!41 contributing artists. Six men (by name analysis; could be fewer). How come? Could it be that a lot more artistic men are making art to sell, while the women are making journals?"
2,Artists Journals and Sketchbooks: Exploring and Creating Personal Pages,"Disappointed with this book. I found it very light in fundementals of bookmaking. Lots of pictures of examples of things made, however if you are a fairly creative persons this really offers nothing new."
4,Good book Great info and photos,"Basically a wonderful book for anyone wanting inspiration. Has lots of ideas, although most I already knew they sparked my creative spirit again! I think someone wanting to experiment more and push their personal limits would find this book Exceptional. An all around wonderful book.."
4,Inspiration for novice art journaler,"I stumbled upon art journaling while researching art projects for my clients (I'm a child therapist, but not an art therapist). I purchased this book and I have found it to be chock full of inspriration, encouragement and ideas. A variety of artist's journal pages are displayed and the narratives describe the process and the message the artist is trying to convey. The book describes techniques that anyone can use and suggests supplies and techniques to get you started. It is not a step-by-step how-to book, but I've gotten so many ideas from it. It's beautiful to look at and I've gone back to it again and again. I've purchased a couple of spiral notebooks, some basic art supplies and started on my own journal. That's a pretty bold leap for someone whose stick figures are laughable."
3,quickly absorbed light cream,"This eye cream is overall okay. It's a light cream which the skin absorbs quickly. But it's a little too light for me. I felt like it didn't really protect my eyes. I'd preferred a thicker eye cream like Kiehl's Avocado Eye Cream, for which you will definitely know it will be there for a long time.I'm not saying tis eye cream is not good. But considering the price, I have to say this product didn't meet my expectation."
3,well...,"i read a review about this product before i bought..but i dont really found the differences..well.. i guess i have wait for a week to see anything happens..compare to the amount, its quite expensive.."
4,The Tourneur Touch,"STRANGER ON HORSEBACK is the least known of Jacques Tourneur's westerns, which include two other Joel McCrea vehicles, WICHITA and STARS IN MY CROWN (not really a western in my view, but widely regarded as such), and the justly celebrated CANYON PASSAGE. The tightly-constructed story involves a circuit-riding judge with high standards of personal and public behavior faced with some difficult decision-making when he runs up against the renegade son of a too-powerful rancher. This is one of the best examples of the way Tourneur uses windows and doors as referents for different planes of vision and passages between diverse systems of moral value. This disk appears to have been reproduced from a television broadcast, and isn't as pretty as the film deserves, but for now it's all we've got and we're sure lucky to have it."
5,My mistake...,"It's actually ""Translation"" that Peter Case co-wrote with John Faye on this album. But I don't change anything else I said in my prior review. This CD rawks."

5,The Best Study Habit Guide Ever,"I've received three degrees, most since I discovered Dr. Olney's fantastic system. Not so much a how to study, but more a how to play the game of college. Prior to reviewing Dr. Olney's tapes I received good grades - A's and B's. Afterwards, I received all A's and one B+. Listen to this man, he'll save you countless hours of frustration and allow you to get better grades with less work.Brian"
1,It could be the best ever but........,"Once you actually get this game to load, and wait again for it to load some more and load yet another time, you will find this game EXTREMELY buggy and laggy. I have played other on-line games and this is the worst yet. Load times are just ridiculous. Not mention how often you will loose the connection and have to LOAD it all over again! This has real potential but they need to take lessons from DFLW,Everquest and etc, once all the bugs are gone and keys are more configurable (this games Hates Feedback)this could be the best online game ever."
1,This outta be a crime,"I bought this game like a fool after trying it to try it out in demo online. I was never able to get the downloaded version to run but figured it would be corrected by the production version. I immediately had to download a patch that took hours on my dial up and the game still didn't run. I emailed their help desk numerous times and only received one response which said ""this issue is resolved"". Funny the game didn't seem to know and still wouldn't work!!Don't bother posting on their BB asking for help. You won't get a response and if you mention not getting a response and asking what is their problem there are some really hostile folks will will flame you.Save your money. I was so fed up I threw this game away."

3,A Game with a Future,"After receiving my game from Amazon, I intalled it according to instructions. From there I was not able to play until almost two weeks later. Customer support was behind because of the release of the game. Cornered Rat released this game before it was finished so there are a lot of features that are not yet incuded in the game. No ships yet, numerous weapons, etc. I was extremely frustrated with the lack of support. Once they fixed my problem which was the day before yesterday, I have played the game, and it is a blast. I think that this game will grow, and as it grows, so will it's popularity. It is fun, and the team work from other players is a pleasant surprise."
5,"Great game, evolving, but what online game isnt?????","This game looks like it will be the game to beat in the online game battlefield. Sure, it has its problems, but what online game didnt' start out. How dim witted and forgetful some people are that are quick to belittle this game. Everquest started out very buggy when it was released, but is now the top rated online game. I predict that WWII online will do that and more. The developers have many more features left that are not yet implimented, but will be someday in the near future. Absolutely a blast to play, a must buy, but would suggest waiting a month or so for the bugs to be squashed and features to be implimented, if you have a short attention span."
1,Wait until the kinks are worked out.,"The game has potential but at the time of this writing (5/8/01), the multiplayer servers seem to be down more often than not. Also the game needs a lot of resources. Pay attention to the Recommended specification. There is an offline mode to the game but there is not much to do. The manufacturer's website has a forum with more information on the current state of things."
5,Don't be discouraged by the reports from the front!,"Many are screaming about the foul-ups at Cornered Rat Software. The first 3 days have been met with hardware failures, allowing only 500 online at a time. I personally have only been able to access only the offline version, but let me tell you this: This is the ugliest, dirties, buggiest hunk of code that you will EVER LOVE. I heard that from one of the boys who actually got in, and believe me, it will rock.The world is immersible, and it will be awesome. Have faith! It will overcome the early problems and soon take its place as one of the most revolutionary games in the history of gaming."
2,Beware Buyers - Best to wait awhile on this one,"Just a warning for any buyers that the server for this game has had HUGE problems and has crashed numerous times! Apparently, the server was never tested with the amount of people that would be playing online. Right now, the company is putting a hold on free one-month trial accounts as most people have yet to play the game online.I would wait a few months before purchasing this title. In the age of internet financial disasters, this is another title that was rumored to have been rushed into production because of limited income. (In other words, the game wasn't tested enough to make sure it would work right.)The game looks fun and exciting if it works, but I would check out internet bulletin boards or news sources before purchasing this game (and the monthly online payments) to make sure everything is satisfactory."
1,"DON'T BUY, GET BATTLEFIELD 1942 INSTEAD!","I have a brand new computer, and I could not get this game to work on it. I tried again and again, but it always froze. I checked and double checked the requirements, but othing worked. Then about a year later, I read about battlefeild 1942. Although i figured I would eventually get it, I was going to wait a bit, I was nervous after this games huge dissapointment. Then I got the game as a gift. I have played a lot of WWII games. But Battlefield 1942 is easily the best. Sense it was made after this game, It obiusly leared from this games mistakes."
2,Has promise but doesn't look complete,"This game has the potential to be something great. Unfortunately it appears that the game is being rushed out the door before it is completed to a satisfactory condition.I would wait on this purchase until the game has been released. In time it will be great, but if you want to save yourself headaches and frustration pass this up until a significant number of post release reviews are published.The game will include infantry, tank and air operations. But the naval part of the game will not be released until sometime afterwards.If you are looking for a simulation and first person shooter game in a persistent world environment based off of a World War 2 theme then this game might be for you. I would recommend revisiting it two-four weeks after release before deciding to buy."
1,not one reviewer has played it yet,"what a joke. i am still waiting for this game to come out, but there are 5 reviews here. hmmm, smells like little kids talking about something they know nothing about; and that is if the GAME is good or not. they seem to understand the IDEA behind the game is good, but they know NOTHING of if the GAMES ITSELF is good.for those readign this, the game is supposed to come out around the 6th of June. do not buy it based on these ""reviews"", wait for it to come out and for mags to review it.i rated it a big fat 1, to help balance out what these reviewrs have done here."
2,"Long on idea, short on execution","I really, really wanted to like this game. It's easily the best idea I've seen in the last decade. Imagine a game that simulates the entire scope of the Second World War - ground, sea, and air. Very cool.Sadly, the game itself doesn't measure up to the idea. First, there are staggering hardware requirements that still don't provide smooth enough framerates for air-to-air combat at all times, numerous problems with the network and servers, and a log-in mechanism that requires your browser (eating up even more resources). But worse than all those are the damaged physics models (the tanks feel like they are made of styrofoam) and the fact that real-life tactics don't work while gamey tactics do work.Having said all that, this game still has promise. I'd keep an eye on it, and if they are still in business in a year or two, it might be worth another look."
1,Awful,"The most important thing to beware are the 'minimum' requirements. You really need something in the region of 1GB RAM, 1Ghz Processor, Cable/DSL, 32MB Video Card. Even then I've heard of people who have trouble with the game speed. My set up met the recommended specification and my PC just can't handle it. There appears to be a problem with 'memory leaks', which means the software just keeps grabbing more and more RAM as its played. Quite frankly this game should still be in beta testing. Don't waste your money."
1,Looking for a new game? Well.....,"Click the back button on your browser and look elsewhere, absolutly by far the biggest waste of time and worse game ever to come into the market. Graphics? SNES is about equal, Gameplay...sweet god by far takes the cake as the worst ever. Sound? Oh yeah hearing your infantrys footsteps for an hour and a half, another high point of the game. Oh yeah, and we get the priveledge of paying 9.99 a month for it. (Which i have absolutly no problem doing, and have done for the last 3 years other games)Save your money, buy anything but this..."
2,Not quite there yet,"This game has serious problems with playability. The dissappointing thing is, while playing the offline mode you can see the potential of the game. The biggest complaint is the slow frame rate and incredible lag which, for most users, makes the game unplayable. I would recommend waiting to buy this game for a few months until the kinks are worked out. I feel it was released too early, but hopefully the game will improve."
1,Has Not Gotten Any Better,"I have been with this game as a supporter since launch day. After the initial pathetic launch, I decided to stay with this game hoping that things could only get better. The stability of the game has improved, but the play and strategy of the game is not there.If you are a history buff who wants to be immersed in a realistic war environment, skip this one (no matter how much you love WW2 history). If you are a fan of games where you just run around and shoot things, buy a game with better graphics. If you like to sit around with a glimmer of hope that all things improve and find things like grass amusing, buy this game."
1,Read this before buying,"I recently bought the game... I should tell you to keep your money and use it for a game like HL-Couter Strike which defenetly is better than WW2 online. If you buy WW2 online, you will notice that you need a ""super system"" of computer. You need A LOT of RAM memory in order to get a decent movement in the game. The graphics are just terrible, is not easy to get connected and the game play is horrible. Don't buy this."
1,It could use a make over,With the tech of today and the so called tech the people who made this game it could use a lot more graphics and a story of update when you get in. it costs money to pay for a game that a 2 year old made. it does have a very good map but it gets boring waiting on a tank or opel blitz or even running and walking to the battle feild. while i did the waiting a got a small paper wheiht to keep the walk button down while i read and watch it from time to time checking my map to see my map. and also when you get under a tank and shoot the bottom of the tank you destroy it. you die in 1 or 2 hits and when you get shot your screen gets blinking with red which is redder when u have more damage.
5,the best game,I have never played a game so good. all you need is a lot of mb.i spent 19 days in a row playing this game i played it day and night it is a really good game
2,One Star for play - One star for concept.,"When this game was released in June, it had issues. We all said ""just give it a couple of months, it will work its self out.""Well, it's subscription based now, six months, and the quality is still suffering.I really, really wanted this to work. The concept of this was so impressive that it alone earns bonus points.But, sadly, that massive concept was also the downfall of it. Trying to be everything, it manages to be nothing well.Save those Christmas dollars (and the monthly fee) for something more robust.This is such an awsome concept, I find it hard to believe some company with stronger coding ability will not attempt a project like this again."
1,update on ww2 online,well its offical now no navy to be added to the game until late 3Q 2002.before you buy this game i highly recomend you frequant the game website home page and the player forums for at least some ideal of the current state of the game.
1,Worst launch ever?,"Massively multiplayer online games have had their fair share of problems. Ultima Online and EverQuest had lots of lagging issues, but at least *the game* still worked. Apparently, StrategyFirst didn't consider this when they released WWII Online.I have a PIII 450 with 128 megs of RAM. It just barely exceeds the minimum requirements, but, according to StrategyFirst, the game *should* work. Unfortunately, it doesn't. When I'm not being booted out to the Windows desktop, I'm trying to figure out how to get the game to load. It doesn't look like this is restricted to low-end computers, either. I've seen a PIII 700mhz computer with 386 megs of RAM do the exact same thing.WWII Online COULD have been one of the best massively multiplayer online games released in years. In my opinion, it turned out to be the worst. I give the developers 1 star for effort."
2,Big Beta Test,"I bought this game a week after it was released and have been playing it ever since. I love it, and yet I can't recommend it! Very few of the ""real War"" features have been implimented so far. Crashes abound, and the game is basically in a beta test mode.Still... If you're into the subject and like team oriented action, there's a lot of GREAT FUN here! When it's working, the action is gritty and intense. Just bring a halftrack full of patience!Bottom line: This WILL be a GREAT GAME. Someday.System Notes: Myself and many others play on 56k dial-up. A good connection is important (I like at least 49k), but RAM is the key to FPS in this game. You'll NEED a full 512Mb as this game is a BIG memory hog!"
5,A Must Read!,This is a book that lives up to its title and then some. It is not only the complete guide it is a definitive guide. A must read!
3,music from the serials,"A really nice trip to a bygone age of years gone buy, of some of the finest serials made, however, im a little dissapointed , as the adventures of captain marvel theme tune could have been made a little longer,"
5,Socket Tray,I have 4 of these. I have used them for years. The first thing I do is saw the handle off so it will fit in my tool box. I like them a lot. Color is wrong in the photo; it really green.
2,Disappointing,"My daughter loves all things Fisher Price, we have discovered. But this is one of the few toys I feel was a wasted buy. The magnets fall off the refrigerator easily. The ""activities"" are difficult for her to master without help. Especially the squeeze duck, she can never get it to squeak without my help. Not too interesting. If you are wanting good magnet toys for your child, invest in the Leap Frog Fridge Phonics; it is educational, and my daughter LOVES playing with it. Plus the magnets are much stronger, and it is easier for her to use, so she can play independently; isn't that the point of a fridge toy!"
3,OK... but not for the fridge/kitchen,We got this in hope that they would occupy the little one while I was cooking dinner. The problems is (like everyone else said) they dont work on the fridge... waaaay to heavy.The baby does drag them all over the house and gets some of the things to work... laughs when we do the others. They are ok... just wish they would have worked as intended.
2,Boring,"Good idea, poorly executed. Magnets are too weak, buttons too hard to push and quite frankly, the whole thing turned out to be a drag. BORING!!"
2,not what i expected,"I would like to see the magnets on this toy stronger. The baby easliy pulls them off the refrigerator, they spend more time on the floor than up where they can be played with."
4,Toy,"The only problem I have with this is, the tractor with wheel is a little heavy, so if you try to turn the wheel, it moves the whole thing. love the sounds, and I believe the new granddaughter will enjoy it. And learn from it."
1,Not the typical erotic suspense film,"If you are looking for a hot Maria Ford suspense / softcore / erotic movie, than don't waste your time with this one. There is a plot - yes - and the movie tries hard to develop it. The movie also teases the viewer with some nice outfits for Maria - but this never translates into any real action - which is why 97.8% of us buy her movies."
4,Managing Agile Projects,"I fear I may have made a poor choice in choosing this book as my introduction to Agile Project Management (APM). Although the book outlines some of the main principles of Agile Methodology quite well, it often leans towards the author's area of expertise, Extreme Programming (XP). In the book's introduction it is suggested that if you were new to APM it may be a good idea to start at Chapter 10: ""Transitioning From The Familiar"", then return to beginning of the book. I followed the suggestion but that should've given me a clue.On the positive side, each chapter is contains activities that can be implemented to put Agile methodology to practice. For example, in the Chapter dedicated to APM practice, Open Information, some of the activities described there include: Collocate Team Members, Use of Information Radiators, Conduct Daily Stand-Up Meetings, etc..."
2,a piece of crap,does not work at all. Too short. Don't waste your money. You might be able to make the web into something else to make it useful.
1,"Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire","I was terribly disappointed when I opened it, because I hadn't been aware that the book was in Spanish. It is my mistake. I've learned to be more careful next time I order."
5,Delicious travel back in time via DVD....,"THE NOEL COWARD collection....is simply a treasure. Yes, we will eachhave slightly different favorites...but...there is not a dud in the whole box. And, there is a monumental ammount of material...and all of it first rate. I becan with disc TWO and ran one dvd a night...andTHEN did disc ONE and watched ""The Vortex"" last...and indeed, it was not a personal favorite...but it was well done and beautifully mounted like everything in this collection. Yes, there were nine plays in TONIGHT AT 8:30...and only EIGHT are included on this disc. Joan Collins is a total delight in all of them...and she plays a wide variety of rolesfrom glamourous through frumpy. All I can say...is...I have never bought a BOX so full of treasures and so entertaining throughout. I havewatched everything and still have all the audio only features to examine.You will NOT get more BANG for your BUCH anywhere. THIS IS IT."
1,The Noel Coward Collection (BBC Video),"The plays and radio plays chosen were generally interesting -- even if more variety rather than sometimes the play and radio version of the same thing on the same disk. But the engineering and production was an abomination. The acts of ""Private Lives"" on radio were out of order, and the third act of ""Blithe Spirit"" was left out entirely. In addition, the disks were frequently flawed enough so that they stopped and skipped. It was a nice idea, but the production is bad enough to make us wary of purchasing any BBC Video productions."
2,Present Laughter fabulous....the rest a BORE!!,"After suffering thru several of these, poorly acted, laugh tracks inserted capriciously, etc. etc., I came to Present Laughter. This play is sooooo rich in various kinds of humour and satire. The actors and direction are a total delight. I cannot imagine an actor who comes anywhere near Donald Sinden. He is just incredible. I can watch this one over and over. It is so richly done I always find something new in it."
3,"Mostly Entertaining, but some duds","We found this set to be entertaining, particularly Hay Fever; however, there are some duds in this set such as the Vortex. 3 1/2 stars is my ""real"" rating but I cannot reflect that in the system, so 3 stars it is."
3,Narrow Shoes,"This slip-on is not as comfortable as it looks. It's too narrow. I think it will be more comfortable if you have narrow feet. If you have regular-width feet, you should order wide. It also seems its fit is not true size. I usually order a half-size bigger for closed shoes. I should have ordered the exact size, so they won't rub on my heels when I walk. It makes my feet hurt and blister.It certainly has that classic look. I would have loved to wear them if only they don't hurt."
2,cute but not comfy,"The shoes are cute, but they rub alot on the heels. They are not comfy to wear for a long period of time. Also, I ordered the natural ones, which look tan from the picture, but were yellow when they arrived."
1,RUN NOW!,"Save your money and invest in a Pet Rock. You'd get amusement from it than you will from this dreadful film. I picked it up at a Blockbuster previously viewed movie sale. Thank god it was only 1.99. And now I know why. IT'S AWFUL. I honestly tried to watch this movie, but I had to fast forward through most of it because of the insipid dialogue and trite premise. It tries to come off as a serio-comic romance, but it's boring, predictable and trite. If you come across it, lie very still and it may just sniff you and leave you alone. If it doesn't, may God take mercy on your mortal soul."
1,Product arrived in poor condition,"The bag of dove chocolates that I order were left on my doorstep in the middle of the day. Being summertime, it was quite hot outside and the chocolates melted partially. Unfortunate because they aren't edible."
4,Rangers Gone Bad,"What would it take for a Texas Ranger to go bad? This story gives you two perspectives: that of Rangers filled with greed and that of a Ranger filled with rage. Each feels his actions are justified.For a Western novel in the old tradition with a new twist on what can drive a man to evil, this book gives the reader a story that is hard to put down until he gets to the last page.I found the novel spell-binding and each time I read it I found something new, something that I had somehow missed in the previous reading.This is a book that Western fans simply must read: a great story."
5,The Vivid Old West,"Mr. Williams brings an excellent and interesting approach to spinning a yarn of the old west; while I'm normally not a ""wild west"" type of reader, upon recommendation, I picked up a copy of this book; it is the first western I've enjoyed cover to cover; the author has created vivid and vibrant characters which appear quickly in the mind's eye of the reader. Next, I'd like to see him write a book about days of castles and palace coups.."
3,pretty good but hard to inflate,this is a good toy once it is inflated but took way too long to do so. for the money i think there are better toys out there.
2,Disappointed.,"I guess I expected a product that was easy to use and which yielded a great cup of coffee. Instead, using the MyPod, I only got a very small (four ounces) serving of weak coffee. And still had the messy clean-up! The only advantage is that you are able to use your own ground coffee."
2,"Filters OK, MyPod not","The filters fit and do what they are designed to do, thought a little costly for what you get. Unfortunately, the MyPod that they fit just doesn't do anything but make a colored water drink that doesn't come close to EcoPod or the standard pods for the coffee machine."
2,Does not work with Senseo! Made a mess!,I bought these to try with my senseo but I was left with messy coffee grounds stuck in my machine and light brown water in my cup. These are not pods but just paper circle filters the same size or smaller than Senseo pods. There is no pocket to put coffee in. I would have given it one star but I used it for off label use so who knows? It might work with the Presto machine although I don't really see how since there is no pocket to place the coffee in.
3,make your own,"Purchase from Amazon.com: a ""Fiskars Squeeze Punch X-Large, Round 'n Round by FISKARS"", and make your own from cheap full-size grocery store coffee filters. Each cheap grocery store coffee filter yields 6 or 7 of these mini-filter pads."
5,Pod Replacement Filters,"Hay a Mypod? You need these filters! Remember to dampen them before adding the coffee so they ""sit"" better in the Mypod! Practice!"
5,coffee pods,These little filters are a much less expensive alternative to the coffee pods that fit the Senseo machine. They make 2 cups of great coffee and you can adjust the strength by adding more coffee.
4,Presto coffee filters,"filters are fine, using my own filters and the filter holder enable me to brew every day fresh and the kind of coffee I like/prefere. And thank you Amazon for good service, prices and products I can trust."
4,great for the price,"After looking at the price of Baby Bjorn, we decided to purchase this carrier. Our daughter loves it. When she was 3 months old facing in, she always fell asleep and now facing forward, she seems very comfortable. It adjusts well to fit both my husband and myself. The only complaint I have is that because the straps don't cross in the back, it feels like it might fall off of your shoulders-but it never does."
2,Save your money,"I'm a new mother of a beautiful baby girl and bought this carrier to make my short walks a lot easier BUT when I did my baby had no support one the head or her neck, she was constantly fussing and crying AND MOST IMPORTANT was so close to my chest facing me that she looked like she could barely breathe. I wouldn't recommend it. I should have read the reviews before going to the stores they really do help alot.."
3,So-so carrier,"This carrier seems comfortable for my 3-month old daughter (facing in) and is very comfortable for me, however I noticed that the straps near my daughters face are not covered and are very rough. Also, when facing in, these straps cross right in front of her line of sight. So far she has always been awake when I've had her in it, but if she tries to sleep, I imagine the rough straps will rub her cheek. I will exchange this carrier for a different one that doesn't have this problem. It could be because of my daughter's size - she's very tall for her age. Other babies may not have this problem."
2,Not good for spinal development,"A baby's spine is placed in a compromising position in many of today's popular carriers. If the carrier positions the infant upright with legs hanging down and support at the base of the child's spine, it puts undue stress on the spine causing a condition called spondylolisthesis, and compromises developing curves in the spine.When a baby wants to be more upright to see the world around him (around 4-5 months of age), the carrier should allow him to sit cross-legged, so his weight is dissipated through his legs and hips as opposed to the style of carrier that has the baby's legs hanging down, where again the young spine has to bear the entire weight of the child, and can cut into the baby's circulation by holding the legs apart in a bowlegged manner during the important early months when the pelvis is soft and forming.http://www.earthbaby.com/babywearingindex.html"
5,A fictional biography of a decadent aristocrat,"This is a fictional account of the life of a real person, the decadent pederast Count Fersen, who lived on Capri because even the French would not tolerate him. The key to the mysteries surrounding this novel are to be found in a long and excellent article available on the internet, by Will H. L. Ogrinc, 'Frere Jacques: A Shrine to Love and Sorrow', which may be accessed from the bottom of the wikipedia article on Jacques d'Adelsward-Fersen."
3,more suspense focused,"Firefighter heroine is resisting her asthma diagnosis & its repercussions re: her well-loved job & goes to public-clinic doctor hero, who's her old childhood friend, for help. Both become coincidentally embroiled in an arson-murder with the hero as its focus.Thompson writes well but I found her detailed writing & characterization distracting from the book's emotional pace. In fact, I found this book NOT emotionally engaging. It's like watching the news versus a movie...and I prefer my books to be like movie-watching. It's probably because it's more suspense-focused. The romance was 2ndary & lacking in heat.Partially recommended for the suspense but not the romance."
4,An essential tool in learning Hebrew,"I am a convert to the religion, nothing helped my new hebrew skills more then this small book. I'd tried tapes and fancy computer programs but this is the thing that worked. If you are converting, learning, or mastering this book is GREAT"
5,Delight to the nature-lover grounded in reality,"The information on handlogging is surpassed by descriptions of the places the Jacksons visited on their boat and their many encounters with wildlife--from mice to mountain sheep, deer and bears. It is told with warmth. The relationship between man and wife and their support of one another leaves you always wishing for their success as they face the Alaska wilderness."
5,super book,"This is a super book. It paints life as a logger in Alaska, bordering the cold, clear bay waters. Logger Jackson often works alone, and always the work is dangerous. I loved the book"
4,An Alaskan Wilderness Story,"About a man who made his living handlogging on the Alaskan coast. He worked mostly with an ax, and tried to fell the trees so that they slid downhill into the ocean. At the end of the season, he'd tow his logs to the mill. During the winter, he would trap. He and his wife lived on a boat and enjoyed the rugged lifestyle.A good winter's read."
3,Didn't work for us,"Originally bought this for our 2009 Ford Flex, it does not fit and don't let Ford tell you it does. You need the 58 inch bars and then it fits great!!!"
4,Thule Load Bars,"The Thule Load Bars are fine, fit well and were easy to install. The only comlaint I have is the whistling noise generated when the car is on the highway."
3,Functional but significantly worse than previous generation,"I am the second owner of 10 years old Thule bars that saw a lot of beating and they just great. Sturdy, strong grip, fits ski, bikes and many more attachments. I've bought this model because my old one did not fit the new car, not enough width and I have many attachments that fit square Thule bars.This new model of cross bars is a complete disappointment, they are functional but quality and utility is no close to old one. The feet are not attached to the bars and can slide freely anyway the bars are pointed, when you put on or take bars off the cars the feet could slide, knock off piece of plastick at the end of the bars and fly into random directions or hit your arm. I am sure the plastic ends that covers holes of the bars will be lost on first road trip.Find old model on the craigslist or eBay, they are much better done."
3,Good product - little pricey,"As stated in previous reviews, rack does indeed attach quickly and securely. Mounted mine to our 2010 Ford Flex (58"" bars) with no problem. Rack does indeed make a lot of noise. I would certainly recommend buying the fairings if you plan to have the rack attached for any length of time. My only negative is the price! Sure it's a good product, but I felt I'd paid an extra 50.00-60.00 bucks for the Thule name. Oh well, guess I could have gone back to Ford dealership for factory rack. That would have made this one look like a steal."
5,I Love this Coloring Book!,"I am an avid collector of coloring books, even though I'm technically a grown-up. This one meets all my requirements and expectations. The line drawings give room for exploring color and shadow, but have plenty of detail - you can tell what each thing is. I like the alphabet-style presentation of the Sonoran desert denizens and this would be great for any child learning their ABC's, even if some of the words are a little long. The paper is sturdy and watercolors or brush markers could be used with little or no bleedthrough, and the blank backs some might consider a waste of space prevent cross-over coloring. As an armchair botanist I appreciate the Latin taxonomy being included with the regular English names of the plants. The authors are well versed in the subject matter... and best of all, there's a coyote in it :)"
3,"Good Looks, good pliers, but overall, a little disappointing","I bought the ""juice"" on Leatherman's reputation, before actually handling it in a store. The first time I tried to flip out the screwdriver blades, I nicked my thumb and actually drew blood. OUCH! After a few tries, I figured out how to get them out safely, but I wish I had a tutor before hand. Another gadget buddy bought one too and brought his in to work to show me. He also showed me his bloody thumb - so it wasn't just me. All is not bad. The pliers are strong. The corkscrew actually works well (tried it on a tough cork). The philips head screwdriver blade is strong and useful. The wirecutters work well too. The basic knife blade is just the right size to cut a NY bagel - wish it locked in place for safety. All in all, it needs a little refinement to be ""best in class"" but it's getting close. Try it in a store first and be careful not to get nicked. As with all ""edged"" tools, for safety, exercise extra care when handling."
4,A Recording of Love,"Kaplans recording of Mahler 2 is another great version of a masterpiece. The music is smooth and forceful and extremely well produced Kaplans performance never errs on the side of excessive soppiness or cliches. The andante is especially beautifully played. The choir in the Scherzo is warm and full and well captured balancing well with the orchestra and the sound is brilliantly recorded. Not as lush a performance as Tennstedt, as fiery as Rattle or as majestic as Solti but a great version nonetheless."
2,Good performance altered...,"The london symphony is amazing. and you CAN hear it in this recording. But overall i feel that the record is altered TOO much digitally. Whether its the brass being made ""tin-ier"" or instruments turned up (where the clarinet is louder than the french horn haha, will never happen) etc... also some of the dynamic ranges in this recording, im sorry to say, sound almost impossible. They go from where you have to turn the speakers alll the way up, to where you just about blow them out. The only part on the record i love is the final ""Pesante"" track which just sounds amazing. But the rest of it is just... too digital-sounding for me. I prefer an organic, live-sounding recording that is not altered (except the usual mics which are used live anyway). And might i say, the London Symphony should NEVER be altered: they are the most amazing group in this day and age and their sound ABSOLUTELY should never be changed like this."
1,This game blows,"As I said, this is one of the worst games I've ever seen. All the reviews I read said it had fantastic graphics, but I thought they were on par with an old super nintendo game, and my computer has a fast processer and a great video card. Once I was in the game I was bored out of my mind. I was hoping for an action packed tank battle, but instead I got me cruising along a river looking at trees.If you game games that have action, DON'T get this one. If you want a game that will help put grandma and the kids to sleep, this is for you."
5,"A great, easy to read guide.","As a novice diver, I found this guide amazingly easy to read. Sites are rated on a 5 star system for both diving and snorkeling separately. Information on approach and typical conditions are given. Typical things that will be seen are also given.

5,"If you wanna go for a ride, Buckle Up.","Sharam's Dubai is nice, if you want to hear some more of what you've already heard somewhere before. Don't get me wrong, I admire Sharam, and the two make an amazing duo, but Dubfire has surpassed Sharam in his solo attempt. What you have to do is listen to these two CD's with an open mind, especially CD 2, but unfortunately that tends to be the problem with those who aren't seeing much in it. You will like CD 1, but if you come to music with the expectation of getting blown away everytime, you will then love the second. In fact, you might just end up thanking Dubfire for leading you into the deeper, darker recesses of music and your mind and may just make you realize that ""spooky"" is not a category exempt from this thing called music."
5,Dubfire + Sharama the greatest GU's in a long time,Dubfire's latest compilation album is one of the greatest i've heard from a GU release. I believe this one is even better than Sharam's. Both CD's are great not like the others when usually the first CD is softer and you only listen to CD 2. This one starts with very danceful songs and then turns a bit heavier but still with vocals and with great rythms.You won't be disappointed with such a great compilation album.
4,What happened to CD 2,"Cd 2 is great, then we get to CD2 and it just kind of went off into trance city, there is a couple songs that are good but for the most part, CD 2 can just stay in the case. Sharam Dubai is way better"
4,Dubfire is the man,"I've listened to both discs twice now, and have gotta say I'm not loving the first. The second, however, comes with some very hard tracks that sound great out of a good system. Reminds me of a bassier version of GU: hong kong.As far as the 'progressive' aspect, it's there, more notably on the second disc. Also the discs ring true to Dubfire's style.It was worth the money"
3,"Good movie, horrible sound track","I liked this movie, but the soundtrack was horrible. Very loud and soft. Had the volume at ""59"" on my sound scale a number of times. The acting and the plot were memorable. The scenery brings the rugged countryside to life. Oleg Menshikov was excellent as always. All the actors were perfect in their roles."
3,Review of the Prisoner of the Mountains,"Before watching this movie I thought it was a war movie. But in reality it was story about people, both Russian and Chechen. There really isn`t any battle scenes expect the one in the beginning.Two most important characters in the movie are the Russian soldiers, who are captured by a Chechen man. They are strangers at the beginning, but being captured together forces them to get to know each other. They become friends -or last something like that.There are some powerful women roles in this movie. The Chechen girl Dina is by far the best character in this movie. She is young but strong. (The actress was only 13 when the movie was filmed; she did a really good job). I also liked Vanya`s mother -she didn`t settle for the answers she got from Russian army and tried to do something by herself.Scenery is this film was really beautiful with the mountains and small Chechen village in the middle of nowhere."
2,Prisoners of the Mountains,I thought this movie was decent but nothing spectacular. It kept me awake but just on the verge. The few comical scenes helped to keep me interested as did the totally unexpected ending which was probably the best part of the entire movie. I thought the acting in this movie was just mediocre at best. Overall I was not impressed with the movie but the few good scenes earned it two stars over just the lonely one star.
2,Where was the War?,"This is a film about two soldiers captured during the Chechen war. Normally the Chechen rebels don't take prisoners but one of the men is hoping to trade the soldiers for his son who is being held by the Russians. As time passes the younger of the two soldiers, Ivan, begins to feel for the rebels and to wish he could live among them. The soldiers are told to write to their families and have them ask the commander to trade them for the rebel's son. Ivan's mother tries but ultimately fails in her attempt. Eventually the rebels get tired to waiting and kill the older soldier. Ivan gets free and runs for the hills ending the movie with his escape."
4,Realism,"In order to understand this movie you have to understand the situation of the Chechnya war. This movie shows how a soldier's mother tries everything in order to help save her son. This movie shows unfair the Chechnya war was. It shows how Russian army doesn't really care about it's soldiers. It shows how the Chechnians will do anything in order to get what they want. This movie is hard to watch. A lot of people may dislike this movie, but that's only because they don't like to look at realism."
3,Three and a half stars,If I could I would put this movie at just below 4 stars. It was really nice photography and I enjoyed the representation of the culture. It was too violent for me to want to see it again.
4,Quietly powerful,"Two Russian soldiers (Oleg Menshikov & Sergei Bodrov, Jr.) are taken prisoner in a remote Muslim village by a man (Dzhemal Sikharulidze) who wishes to exchange them for his imprisoned son. During their captivity, both the Russians and their Muslim captors begin to appreciate the humanity in each other. However, the war continues to exert its dehumanizing influence, pressuring everyone concerned to follow the path of violence. When one character makes a quiet break from this pattern, it is a small triumph in this low-key but affecting film. Though it is never referred to explicitly (at least not in the subtitles), this is clearly intended as a story of the Chechen conflict, even though it is based on a novella by Leo Tolstoy. It is amazing how timely it remains. The cast of mostly nonprofessional actors delivers marvelously natural performances."
1,decieved,"I HAVE E-MAILED AMAZON SEVERAL TIMES ABOUT MY DISSATISFACTION WITH THE CREDIT CARD PROMOTION. I GUESS THE LESS RESPONSE YOU GUYS GIVE THE MORE I WILL FORGET. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. I'VE MADE MY LAST PURCHASE WITH AMAZON. I CAN PROVIDE THE DETAILS IF YOU CARE, JUSTIN"
4,HardHouse at it's best.,"This is definatley hardhouse at it's best. If you like hard house music you'll love it. If you don't, then you won't. Simple as that. The first 20 minutes of the first disc kinda drags on but it picks up afterwards. The second one is flawless. I would definatley reccommend this JUST FOR THE ALPHA TEAM TRACK!!!!!! LOVE IT! Go speed racer go!"
1,Didn't Like It,"The title ""history of..."" gave me the impression that the tracks would be ol' school but they weren't.Unfortunately, for me I didn't notice the explicit lyrics warning before I purchased it so imagine my surprise when track 24 played.I wish I had gotten more information on this before I bought it."
1,Boring,"My biggest problem with this movie is that the actors don't seem to understand what they're saying. They seem to be struggling through the lines, because that's what the script said, not because they feel anything, and so the emotion just isn't there. The worst was Ethan Hawke-he was more like an impassionate, objective narrator of a PBS history special than a tortured Hamlet (and Hamlet's problem is that he feels so much and has too much emotion to know how to deal with it). Steven Seagal could have delivered more emotion for crying out loud."
2,Oddly detached,"I found this movie oddly distant and detached. The actors are for the most part good and I was surprised how much I liked Ethan Hawke. But for some reason, the film never engaged me. I always felt ""outside"" the action. Strangely enough, the Kenneth Branagh version, even though it is twice as long, seemed shorter because it involved me.The only exceptions were the scenes involving Sam Shepard as Hamlet's father's ghost. Contrary to some portrayals, you can palpably feel his rage at his brother's betrayal. I wish the entire movie had been as good as his scenes."
1,What were they thinking?,"I am so tired of ""Rock and Roll Shakespeare."" I am all for modern interpretations of Shakespeare - I've even done a couple - but these actors, particularly Bill Murray, could not have seemed less interested in the material. ""Concept Shakespeare"" never works because you have to fit the play into the concept, and not the other way around. Ethan Hawke is a good actor, but woefully miscast in this. Also, setting up Denmark as a corporation as opposed to a country sets the stakes very low, and makes us not care what happens after a while. In this version, Hamlet should have just called the police when he had the evidence and then gone out for a martini."
1,Hamlet from Ohio,"It was a fluke that I saw Hamlet w/Olivier a week before I saw this atrocity. This was the worst version of Hamlet I have ever experienced, it was like a production from my high school. I just couldn't get into it...everyone sounded as if they just arrived from deepest Ohio. Horrible! From Bill Murray to Ethan Hawke no vocal nuances, all very speechified with no feeling for the subject. So I watched half of the movie and put it out in the hall so some other sucker could experience this dreck.ginger"
1,Got to join the dissenting party,"Obviously this film has a legion of detractors ...-- I count myself among their ranks. Just one more criticism I haven't seen anyone else mention -- Ethan says ""to whose bourne no traveler ever returns,"" instead of ""from whose..."" To me this single example sums up how sorry this rendition of Hamlet is. The leading actor, the director, and everyone else associated with the making of this awful movie failed to correct Hamlet's misplacement of a preposition that dramatically changes the meaning of what is probably the most famous group of lines in all of English literature. In my humble opinion, sloppy work like this destroys the whole point of producing a play like Hamlet. If they're not trying to reach an audience who knows the work and cares about it, then who are they trying to reach? This film has no substance. It's a bunch of posers trying to pretend that they're making something new and unique while really they look silly."
4,"Les, you don't know what you're talking about.","Hey Les from Michigan, (See second review at top of page) For one thing Claire Danes was not in this movie. She was in Romeo and Juliet. I think you're confusing movies. Second, if you only watched 45 minutes of the movie and didn't see the whole thing, how in the world can you write a review on the entire film? How can you judge something if you didn't see all of it? Did you even understand it all? Third, I did not think Bill Murray looked like he was singing in a Saturday Night Live lounge, he was serious sounding throughout the movie. He didn't even allude to his comeodious past. I think you need to take a closer look."
1,I really wanted to like it,"Really I did. The setting intrigued me, and I wanted to think that Hamlet could be done in a contemporary corporate setting. Perhaps it can, but, until I saw this, I had no idea that Shakespeare could suck so much."
4,A Hamlet for My Generation,"Ok. I admit it. I was a virgin. I was in Blockbuster and having never read or seen Hamlet I decided to be literary. And I was completely blown away!! It was one of the most enjoyable movie watching experiences of recent memory. I identified completely with Ethan Hawke as Hamlet, and the whole cast (except for Bill Murray).This version of Hamlet is perfect for anyone who has been a college slacker since the 70's and has felt the psychological and philosophical dilemma's that that place in our society engenders. The twin joys of this version are 1) the transcendent beauty of Shakespeare's language; and 2) the univerisality of Hamlet's struggles, which transcends the generations. It may not be for Hamlet scholars, but this one was done for us, and if your one of us, you will enjoy it."
1,Yuck!,"I like Shakespeare enough that I popped for the BBC DVD collection, and Hamlet and Henry V are my two favorite. I have seen maybe 15 different productions of Hamlet, and this is easily the one I disliked the most. If I didn't already known why Hamlet should be interested in Fortinbras, for instance, I would have to ask myself why he was even in the movie. If he did ""What of piece of work is man"", I must have dozed off. No grave digger scene? No handshake between Hamlet and Laertes before the sword fight? In fact, the entire final scene was butchered, in my opinion. Now, I'm not a purest; I've seen out of period productions of a number of plays (Macbeth, Richard III, As You Like It, A Midsummer Night's Dream) and enjoyed them. But this one is just too far out and artsy for me.You may think of Mel Gibson as Mad Max or Martin Riggs, but I think that production was a much better use of two hours. I am, of course, really waiting for Branagh's version to come out on DVD."
1,Please read the play before acting the part,Eathan Hawke manages to turn some of the most beautiful poetry written in English into the most deadpan and apathetic drivel I have ever heard. Perhaps he was sleeping (or the director was). I've seen a version of _Hamlet_ mocked by the characters of Mystery Science Theater 3000 that puts this version to shame. Save your time and money. You'll do better reading the Cliff's Notes or watching _Strange Brew_.
1,TO BAD I COULDN'T SEE THIS...,"Well, first of all, I rented it on Amazon Instant Video and it kept freezing up on me. When it finally stopped freezing, I watched it a bit and couldn't stomach it anymore. It's always good for people to take creative liberties. However this didn't work for me. I just didn't think the dialogue worked with the scenery. I felt that the actors were having trouble making it real and believing it for themselves. Perhaps someone else will like it though."
2,And it had so much potential...,"Contrary to the Amazon review, this rendition of Hamlet was quite disappointing. Hats off to Ethan Hawke for great acting. My compliments end there. Bill Murray was awkward. Someone just needed to steal that hat Ethan Hawke wouldn't take off. Apparently the makers of this movie were overbudget...this assumption stemming from the blantant advertizing throughout. Does every video in a blockbuster store have to have the logo on it? Do we have to have the pop machine as the focal point instead of the actors? Subliminal messages seem far less obtrusive."
3,no cigar,"This movie is far, far better than I would have dared to expect -- and probably about as much as you can hope for from any film adaptation of Shakespeare. Almereyda's Hamlet is a competent and perhaps surprisingly intelligent version, but it lacks the staggering brilliance that characterizes the original. Just about everything that makes Hamlet Hamlet is missing. Clever and enjoyable as it may be, this is but a pale shadow of Hamlet, no more like Shakespeare's masterpiece than I to Hercules.I tend to agree with Nabokov's Van Veen when it comes to Shakespeare: ""A written play [is] intrinsically superior to the best performance of it, even if directed by the author himself."" Whether or not that's ultimately true, this particular performance of Hamlet is a well-meaning disappointment."
1,An abomination,"Run, do not walk, from this unwatchable version of Hamlet. Set in modern-day New York City, but retaining all of the play's references to lords and castles, this film is the most ridiculous and contrived adaptation of Shakepeare I have ever suffered through. Hawke plays Hamlet as a pouty gen-Xer, whose soliloquys are played back on a hand-held recorder. Must been easier to hide the cue cards that way. When Hamlet and Laertes pull out fencing swords on a New York rooftop, it's true eye-rolling time...although not as horrid as when Bill Murray, playing Polonius, hams his way through ""to thine own self be true."" An awful, awful movie."
1,"short, sweet, and to the point.","Horrible... HORRIBLE movie. If they were going to modernize the story, they could have modernized everything. The fact that they were still speaking old English was stupid! It just didn't work. And, good god, the whole ""GET THEE TO A NUNNERY!"" scene was atrocious. Finish the fight over an answering machine? Blasphemy. HORRIBLE horrible horrible movie. I would give it zero stars if that was an option."
3,not quite,"This version of Hamlet is interesting but except for Kyle Maclachlan as Claudius, no one performance really sings. Ethan Hawke's Hamlet is such a little brat that I couldn't understand what Horatio saw in him. He simply didn't have the acting chops to pull this off. Bill Murray's performance was...interesting. He had trouble with the words but he still managed to show that Polonius was pompous, windy fool. This version tries hard but it has no heart and doesn't quite make the audience care. If you want to see a Hollywood treatment of Hamlet get Mel Gibson's version instead or better yet, just get Olivier's version and see the play at full strength."
1,LET ME NOT THINK ON IT !!!!,"In the immortal words of Kurtz from ""Apocalypse Now"" ---""The horror! The horror!"" This has got to be the worst Hamlet ever. I suppose it's worth seeing for that reason alone. I mean, who wants to listen to a voice-over of ""To be or not to be"" while a kid wanders through a video store? I can see kids wandering blank-eyed through the video store at my local [Video Store]. I will say, however, that Bill Murray was an amazing Polonius and the Mousetrap sequence was very inventive. But after that's all over you still have to endure the rest - absolutely AWFUL! Back to Murray - you'd think that Bill Murray as Polonius would be a super-buffoon, but he actually came off like a really nice, concerned Dad-type. I actually felt bad when Polonius got killed, for the first time ever. If you're serious about your Shakespeare, do not expose yourself to this one. You will writhe in anguish."
1,How do you ruin a classic?...Watch this and see.,"By far the worst interpretation of Hamlet I've ever seen, and a terrible film in its own right. You can be as open-minded as you want about re-interpretations of Shakespeare, but this film was more than ludicrously produced: they actually had the cajones to put BILL MURRAY in the role of Polonius, and strangely enough I think he was channeling his character from ""Caddyshack,"" the way he mumbled through his lines. Ethan Hawke delivers his usually half-hearted, bored-with-his-job, GenXer performance. I had high hopes for this film, but it was so over-the-top maudlin that I almost couldn't bear it. There's a difference between exhibiting your interpretation of a classic drama and simply making a film just to see it done--this version of Hamlet is sadly the latter."
2,It's pretty much a mess,"The movie is only worth watching for Maclachlan's performance. He is fantastic in it and he oozes charisma. I can't stand Hawke's scenes because he sounds like reading off a laundry list and he does not look the part. The actors for Gertrude and Laertes are not bad. Murray and Stiles are aweful. The direction is terrible, we are constantly seeing people's back side when they are talking, and there's no special effect for the ghost and the actor who played the ghost did not sound ghostly. It's like they are not even trying. Yeesh."
2,Modern day Hamlet,"This modern day version of Hamlet is quite interesting in its own way. I had watched this movie with the expectation of modern language, and so was pleasantly suprised to find that Shakespeare's language had been (more or less) preserved.I think that if the language had been modernized that this adapatation could have been a little more acceptable. But the younger actors, including Ethan Hawke and Julia Stiles, just couldn't seem to handle Shakespeare's lines properly. Many of their lines were rendered rather woodenly.Had the producers chosen better seasoned Shakespearian actors this movie would have had some real potential. It's a shame that star-power could so blight a promising film."
1,A movie that never should have been made,"I don't know what these people were thinking, but this movie is about as much like Shakespeare's Hamlet as an Elephant is like a chimpanzee. Hamlet's to be or not to be speech in a blockbuster, not even close. This movie uses all the tricks and gadgets from the twentieth century to completely dilute or better yet pollute the orginal play. The acting was lackluster, no emotion whatsoever. The screenplay should was lacking in all areas. Try Branagh's version of Hamlet for what a modern movie about Hamlet should be. This movie was a waste of everyone's time from the start to the end. The only good thing that can come out of this is that a few actors can now add a Shakespearean role to their resumes."
1,Awful- with one priceless moment,"My only real comment on this horrific version of Hamlet is the what this production does to Hamlet's soliliquy.One of the most celebrated scenes in the world's cultural history takes place- in a 7-11/Gas-N-Sip with Ethan Hawke wearing one of those grunge rock Peruvian wool caps with earflaps and tiedowns walking through aisles of fruitloops, Slim-Jims and cokes! A priceless moment of unintended comedy.Horrible rendition of Hamlet though."
1,Among the worst ever!,"This is the worst performance I have so far seen of Hamlet, my favorite of Shakespeare's plays. Compared to the sterling quality of the Kenneth Brannagh production, which breathes brilliant life into the characters, this effort is like a stinking wind off the East River. Not recommended!!!"
1,Horrid.,I think that many of the other reviewers have hit the nail on the head. So I won't bore you with the small points. I'll just say that this play was butchered and if Shakespeare were alive and saw this abomination he would puke in his soup.
3,Techno-babel Hamlet,I unique addition to my collection. I am collecting as many of the different video Shakespeare productions and this a good addition to my collection.
4,It's Hamlet!,"It's always exciting when Hamlet comes alive again in a new reinterpretation that allows us to hear and see and experience this greatest of plays again. This grim and murky setting in corporate New York seems an appropriate equivalent to fuedal Denmark. Everything is out of sync; the characters can't connect, which is just as it should be in a play about lying. The last duel, taking place on the penthouse rooftop, alone made the movie well worth watching."
5,A Must-Read for Social Workers,"By far the most readable book on this subject, and chockful of invaluable hints. The writer obviously cares deeply about the families we are all trying to help. There's no excuse for professionals to make insensitive mistakes if they've read this book."
5,Child Abuse and Culture: Working with Diverse Families,Fast service received book in stated condition. Thank You
4,touching story about clashing cultures,"While on my ""mixed kids educational kick"", I happened upon this beautiful book about forbidden love between a Black military man and a Japanese woman. Trying to give more understanding to my children on how lucky they are to be biracial, I found this story easy to follow (for my kids), beautiful watercolored images, and a lovely personal touch on the last page. This book highlights the deep Japanese traditions and shows my kids that sometimes, love & understanding can conquer all :)"
2,A vague idea of the language,"Hippocrene has published a large number of cheap editions of bilingual dictionaries. They are cheap to produce but this one takes the cake. Sure, it has 6000 entries but at the same time it will completely frustrate the beginning language learner. Why? The editors have completely misunderstood the agglutinive nature of the language. Instead of listing a header with various combinations derived therefrom, they insist that all words are basically incapable of being linked together. Earlier versions of Finnish-English dictionaries by W. Soy in Finland are worth looking into."
2,Alternative,"By the way, I highly recommend ""the little yellow dictionaries by gummerus"" Finnish dictionary as it is excellent, contains many useful phrases as well as useful words and though it is enormous in content (60,000 entries compared to the Hippocrene Consise's 6000) it is no larger in physical size. It is meant more for Finns trying to use English, but I have found it more than servicable for English speakers trying to use finnish. Indispensable, in fact. (This was the dictionary provided by my class THIS year. A great improvement.)"
1,Cookie or boat hook?,"If someone asks you for a cookie, you're going to think they want a boat hook...If someone happens to give you this dictionary for free, your best bet is to use it for starting fires. Buy a Gummerus."
4,Glass Necktie Movie Description:,"A sexy thriller in the vein of FATAL ATTRACTION, this compelling, frightening film follows a man whose cheating heart gets him in more trouble than he ever imagined. In GLASS, NECKTIE, a married man becomes carnally involved with a beautiful young woman who happens to be his best friend's brother's wife. Quickly caught up in a web of kink and voyeurism, this infidel must get out before it's too late."
2,"One slight problem, or perhaps two","There are two problems with this documentary, or perhaps it is one problem, with two parts. Part A is that at the time this film was made anyone who made any kind of an objective and reasonably thorough investigation would have known that the world was in factswimming in oil. Part B is that since the film was made it is no longer required that one make any investigation. The news of the vastamount of oil all over the place, particularly here in North America, is shouted at us from every media outlet. Kindergartners are nowprobably quite aware of the Black Gold boom in North Dakota. None of this should hurt the film though, despite the fact that the wholething is not merely predicated on the fantasy that there is a looming oil shortage, but about that shortage. People who want to believe that there is a coming oil shortage will keep on believing that, regardless of the overwhelming evidence that it is not true."
5,alternative self sustaining,I can solve this i have designs for a self sustaining engine that is air operated once started it supplies its own air supply with reserves.also desings for a self sustaining generator that supplies power to itself and enough to power anything else
3,Collapse,"I was hoping for a little more closure and forecasting in this film. Michael Ruppert's story is interesting and somewhat compelling, but I was expecting more 'vision for the future' from a person who has had such amazing analytical abilities."
5,Must see!!!!!,I was glued to my seat and hardly noticed the passage of time. Make all your friends see it to.
2,A waste of good film,"Glib, isn't he? Has all the ""right"" statistics, all the populist warnings of your typical ""Messiah"" predicting the coming apocalypse. Yet when you focus on what he says, item by item, much of it doesn't hold up to scrutiny. There is just enough ""truth"" to his claims that most will probably accept the rest of the balderdash as genuine.I guess if you tend to run about shouting the sky is falling, the sky is falling, a portion of the population will admire you and send you money for saying out loud what they are feeling inside. After all, fear sells. However, if you are the ""critical thinker"" this nitwit claims to be, you will check some of his ""facts"" and draw your own conclusions. I just wasted about 45 minutes of my day watching this garbage. I hope you don't succumb to the same fate."
4,Informative,"The video CD is good so that I can share the information with others, however, if you go online searching the title and author, you can get even more information. It appears that they have destroyed this man. Never buy anything from the company I bought it from. About 30 days to get product."
1,total crap,This movie is so bad. It might be entertaining if you are a paranoid schizophrenic. It's about an hour and a half of unsubstantiated conjecture. Don't watch it unless you are an idiot.
2,Just another moore movie...,"This is just an ""off-brand"" movie of what Michael Moore would say. Pretty much everyone has heard it; anti-oil, anti-mass produced food, anti-capitalism, etc. This is just a movie showing how the route America has taken will end up being the collapse of it. Not a very enjoyable movie if you're not into the ""close-minded"" sides of an argument."
2,"Please, fact check this author and ""documentary"" producer...","Do yourself a favor and Google 4 or 5 things Michael says in the first 10 minutes of the story. You will find that he blatantly misstates the facts as they are known today. You can't build a foundation for believability if you are willing to change or ignore the basic facts around global peak oil decline rates.Conspiracy theorists, view on, others look elsewhere or try to use this as mis-guided entertainment."
1,Not a Credible Source,"I cannot believe this film was made, and that people rate this four stars on average is shocking. Sure the topic is interesting and relevant, but the guy is sitting there talking about how we're spending billions on the oil thats not there while he makes a couple million talking about what other credible experts have said. Im sorry, but I do not recommend this to anyone."
1,Glad this one was a freebie so it was worth it,"Begins with an interesting introduction, then rapidly devolves into a freak show of conspiracy theories about Iraq etc. This is all about ""peak oil"" as boogeyman. The star claims that all the big oil fields have been found, ignoring (at least in the first part -- I didn't waste my time on the rest) the shale oil finds, and the failure to exploit numerous known reserves. Certainly we will eventually face an energy crisis due to lack of oil, but these Chicken Littles have been making a fortune from the gullible since the 50s..."
5,Brilliant film,Economics to scare the pants off of you! Learn why petro is the bringer of wealth and power and why it may lead us to ruin in the next 20 years
2,Just some stuff said by Michael Ruppert,"I dont mean to be completely critical here the guy has some good points here but he has historically made some outlandish claims as well. This guy may have a thing or two right but even a blind squirrel finds a nut here and there. Just listen to some of the things this guy has said.In 2005: ""I predict we will soon see a national draft, and Canada will not harbor U.S. deserters as it did during Vietnam, as it is now a virtual U.S. colony.""In 2005: While I had serious doubts about America's ability to recover from Katrina, I am certain that - barring divine intervention - the United States is finished; not only as a superpower, but possibly even as a single, unified nation with the arrival of Hurricane Rita.In 2009: ""Now, with the swine flu outbreak just developing, it is clear that the dieoff has begun""Look chief, I get it oil is important and we are running out but there is no draft, NOLA is bouncing back, and NO ONE HAS SWINE FLU!"
1,I would expect more credibility...,"Good ideas, maybe some might actually happen. But this doc is about a guy ranting who has done no research or work to back up his claims other than watch and listen to more intelligent people who have actually done research and acquired data. He goes on and on without a coherent script, and gets painful to watch in the second half. It seemed so half baked I was very surprised people were giving this 3-4 stars let alone 5 stars. Doom and gloom has its many proponents, but there are far more succinct and intelligent people to listen to than this guy."
5,America Awake,"Ruppert has a profound grasp of the enormity of the current financial and social crisis. His early association with the 9/11 conspiracy crowd did stretch his credibility with me. But it doesn't damage the arguments he makes in this DVD. As a nation, we are soon going to experience turmoil and deprivation. It's going to be a high-tech version of the Grasshoppers and the Ants. Ruppert offers a Word to the Wise - be aware, be prepared, and strive towards self-sufficiency. Thanks, Mike!"
2,correlation doesn't prove causation,"It is kinda entertaining, but the evidence he strings his argument together doesn't hold against scrutiny. Then as a pet peeve he incorrectly uses the word ""axiomatically"" at least half a dozen times. Since he loves drawing correlation based conclusions he should look into pirates and global temperatures."
5,You only need a basic understandig of economics,"Its only obvious that at some point we're going to run out of oil. Some try to make it palatable by saying ""we're finding more oil, look at Brazil!"". But the truth is that energy demands are rising and it doesn't matter how much oil we find, it is finite, and it will probably end withing our lifetimes. The Peak Oil threat in Ruppert's opinion is the biggest threat we're facing. This documentary is not a ""feel good"" documentary where at the end everybody joins hands and sing ""we're gonna make it"". This documentary is more like a cry for ""prepare or the human race might go extinct"". Buy this dvd"
5,Some sobering truths,"If, like me, you've never heard the term ""Peak Oil"" be prepared to be blown away by this compelling documentary about how the ""world petroarchy"" is determining all of our futures. Remember how - during W's misbegotten administration - Dick Cheney had US energy policy written by insiders from big oil and big gas? This will give you a case of the latter - or at least agita - and lots to think about."
3,I LOVE RUPPERT's Work,"AND THIS FILM IS GOOD...But the reason I give it only three stars is it's not really worth seeing if you've seen his past lectures/videos. There's two feature length videos he gives which Google/Youtube have online FOR FREE, and there's VIRTUALLY NO NEW INFORMATION in collapse, so I was really disappointed in that. If you want a clean DVD copy of his material, then this is worth buying, it's cheap enough, but if you're looking for new material, you won't find it here. I also found a lot of the interview in Collapse wasn't informative, more so, half of it was Ruppert giving generic philosophy and analogies to the situation we face. This is more about Peak Oil and the economic changes that will be a result of losing Oil. 9-11 isn't discussed at all and not much material on CIA operations versus his previous offerings."
1,a self-aggrandizing - I Told You So,This guy is full of himself and for no real reason other than that from time to time there is always a down turn and it can be predicted by any idiot!!!!Nothing is gained from viewing this video. Here let me sum up the entire 100 minutes in just a few words....I told you so!!!!!!
1,Take with a grain of salt....,"Poor mr. Rupport, he poses as a whistleblower, but he's compromised. He's a fearmonger, who's message is he promoting? scarcity? but not really proposing any solutions. One thing you can be sure of, a sexy woman can mess up his game, every time! Check out the index of Crossing the Rubicon. John F. Kennedy."
1,Fantasy Land,If you like crazy conspiracy nuts who live in Fantasy Land then you will like Michael Rupert. Otherwise go use the bathroom or do something else more productive than watch this silliness.
5,Very well done!,"A very intelligent man speaks about a subject he clearly knows without being a conspiracy nut. Whether you agree with his solution or not, the facts are compelling."
2,Nothing special,"As soon as I seen his ""thorough"" investigation of Nuclear energy and some of his other grandpa ideas I quit watching. Poor research and fear mongering at its finest. I am sure he makes some good points but not worth it."
1,Find a reliable source,"If you want to listen to a guy sit, puff on a cigarette and weave his very narrow and incorrect assumptions together with small truths, in order to baby feed you his crap, go ahead.Editing is alright, lighting in the interview is terrible. Camera work is alright, just a dolly shot moving back and forth a hundred times. Very little quality as far as production value goes."
1,Do they think we are this dumb?,Evidently so. They allow a man with no special knowledge dupe them into belivieing he knows anything at all. I want my time back. I
3,No Collapse,"Surely there will come a time when the oil runs out. However, there will be no collapse. The recent discoveries of vast shale gas and oil reserves in this country and the technical advances which will allow their production will allow time for us to move to a solar economy. This also suggests that similar finds will be made throughout the world. Oil will become more expensive but it will be available for a long time (maybe as much as a hundred years). This not to say we should not move to renewal energy sources. It is just to note that we have time to do so."
3,Collapse Documentary,Having read so many books on the meltdown; this documentary was ok; but to get a much better picture; one should read the books about this.
1,"At the time of this review, at least 77 complete idiots have reviewed this tripe.","The most amazing thing about insane, misinformed, and downright stupid people, is their ability to get on film. This dill weed sits around and talks as though he knows something... But as a Geo-physicist currently retired from the petro-chemical field I can say with no doubt of any kind, he is an idiot about all things oil. Other than than that... Whatever. Truly the amazing thing is that 77 or more other people also have no information about the supply or production of long strings of carbon surrounded hydrogen, yet have no problem spewing their uninformed ""thoughts"" on the mater. Truly sad. As they say, ""it is better to be silent and appear stupid, than to open your mouth and remove all doubt"". Those who care to learn actual information, start with Norman J. Hyne's ""Petroleum Geology, Exploration, Drilling and Production"" it is a great intro in non-technical terms to the world of hydro-carbons."
3,A home made video,"The information given is interesting food for thought, but nothing more. The video is poorly put together; lapses, interruptions, and lack of fluidity make it not very professional. It is a homemade video. A young person viewing this video would probably fall sleep."
1,"Preppers and Dick Chaney haters bed time story, like 80 minutes of National Enquirer headlines","As stated, like listening to someone read headlines from the National Enquirer for 80 minutes. As is usually the case with these kinds of documentaries Michael Ruppert mixes a few facts with a lot of opinion to reach his incredibly paranoid conclusions. Only the diehard anti Bush/Chaney and end of the world crowd will be satisfied with this mans incredibly flawed analysis of history and predictions for our future."
3,Good start; does not go far enough,"Ruppert makes some startling and apparently accurate assessments of various crises we are facing or will face, but he does not go far enough with any of them. This should have been expanded much further."
3,Collapse DVD,"This DVD was essentially an interview with Michael Ruppert who is described as a rogue reporter. He makes many points worth considering regarding the potential for the collapse of our oil based civilization. However, during the interview, the tight focus on the chain smoking Ruppert was distracting and hard to watch. He has a message worth contemplating but if I use the DVD again I will turn off the picture and listen to the sound."
1,"complete garbage, fantasy mixed with convoluted facts","Complete garbage, fantasy mixed with convoluted facts. The make-believe starts right at the beginning where he claims that, as a teenager, the police department informed him he had a top secret security clearance and it was because his father had a clearance. The story telling just gets worse from there. Don't waste your time!"
1,Capitalist,"Funny how he claims he had been predicting a ""collapse"" for years, but releases a documentary after its well on its way. The best part of the video comes at the end when it indicates his new book was largely ignored and he himself is facing foreclosure."
3,Done before,"Collapse gives one good perspective of how the near future might play out. It's nothing that hasn't been said before (Zeitgeist 1 and 2, Endgame) but it's a good watch for people that have a hard time believing or watching something that was given out on the internet for free (Zeitgeist 1 and 2, Endgame)."
2,Yawn.,"Why are people fascinated with collapse anxiety? In answering this question the documentary actually does a pretty good job. It documents its subject as being self destructive, self indulgent, scatter brained, manic, unable to maintain employment, unable to maintain relationships, pay bills, etc. Of course he assumes the rest of the world is the same as him and ready to collapse.As far as presenting any intelligent theory on how the western world is about to collapse, it fails terribly.His arguments essentially boil down to scan the news for data that validates and reinforces your opinion (bad news). Then remind everyone that you have been warning about collapse since 1985-- and apparently failed to see all the global growth and benefits that humans have realized since then.Watching this DVD left me feeling pretty optimistic."
1,ultimately propaganda,sadly i've donated $2.99 to the cause. there are certainly lucid points made about society and oil but this ultimately devolved into castro-prop and obamapology. the views expressed are certainly anti-capitalist and horny for a deeper collapse globally so that the beacon of communism can finally shine upon the earth and help find some monkey.
5,Total Joy,"Moliere and Wilbur, though they did not, of course, work together, are a match for Gilbert and Sullivan as a wedding of talents. Each of these plays is very funny and full of insights about human vanity."
2,Barely readable,"There might be good advice in the book, but it is not written well. There is a lot of self-promotion by the authors. The language changes through the book, probably due to being written by more then one author. At least one of these authors is not understable by American reader at all due to extensive use of (probably) British fishing terminology, incomplete phrases and a lot of ""scientific"" pretense.The entire chapter on bait does not have a single recipe. Nothing even resembling a recipe. Not even a hint of what common ingredients are."
3,Book review,I am a keen fisherman and this book has enlightned me a lot more I have found out how to approach carp fishing in a mental and phyisical way I really enjoyed the book and recomend it to all fishermen.
1,mister,The product does not work properly. When depressed the mister squirts a small stream and does not mist.
5,Worked perfect,This kit fits multiple applications. Everything I needed for my truck was there. I've used Metra items before and work great.
3,Flasks,"I ordered these for my son to give to his grooms men. I wish I had looked some more. The leather was paper thin, and for the price I thought I could have done better."
3,Pretty Thin Gruel,"Nice pictures make this coffee table book attractive to flip through the first couple of times, but the writing is mostly sanitized filler that doesn't tell much you haven't read elsewhere and better and at less than 200 pages the book is a bit less than advertised. There are four or five other Red Sox books out there that give much more bang for the buck: ""Fenway"" has better photos, as do a number of Ted Williams' books, ""Red Sox Century"" has many more pictures and tells the definitive history, ""Tales from the Red Sox Dugout"" has all the anecdotes. Basically, a Red Sox Lite book for fans who don't like to read. If you must have all things Red Sox and already have everything else, get it, otherwise there are better choices."
3,The Boston Red Sox: 100 Years--The Official Retrospective,"The above review nails this book on the mark. Excellent pictures, but the writing leaves something to be desired. There are nice charts/graphs/timelines, however. Definitely NOT a definitive history of the Red Sox, but a nice addition if you have a Red Sox library of books."
2,Grew Up a BoSox Brat,"Let me add my 2 (for 2 stars). The pictures are great, only it would have been nice to know WHO the pictures were of. I thought it would be a 100 year history, but I was wrong. What they wrote about was informative, heart-tugging and interesting. There just wasn't enough of it to justify the subtitle ""100 years. The Official Retrospective."""
2,"Beautifully designed, lacks mystique","This is the feel good book of the century as far as Red Sox retrospectives go -- a true Sox fan could only buy this book for the cover (or, as I did, for the great graphics inside). Beautifully designed throughout, this ""official"" retrospective lacks the heart of the Red Sox mystique: the need for card-carrying members of the Red Sox Nation to ultimately mourn the great losses endured over the past 100 years and still believe. I had to crack open Shaughnessy's ""The Curse of the Bambino"" to right myself."
2,Loss of Happiness in Market Democracies,"Mr. Lane attempts to tackle a serious issue of great importance to modern capitalist democracies. Certainly after long days we all wonder if the drudgery of capitalist lifestyles is worth the rewards. However, the book suffers from many analytical flaws. It attempts to find casual mechanisms resulting in unhappiness, but fails to adequately untangle the many sources of unhappiness and several times places emphasis on clearly the wrong one. The book is also extremely redundant, and could have been condensed to half its size. Lastly, many of the studies cited needed more justification and explanation. The results of the studies certainly are an adequate factual foundation to justify the facade he attempts to build. It certainly is a beginning to a discourse on a serious question, but this book does not have the answers."
4,Suzie's Spelt Breadsticks,"My husband and I have been eating the Blood Type Diet way for over a year now and we don't eat white flour or gluten anymore and I really missed my pretzels. So when I saw this product I thought I would give it a try and was pleasantly surprised with the taste. They are a little dry, of course, but the overall texture and taste was very satisfying. Now I don't feel so deprived anymore."
1,Beware!,"My system has about 30 zones and needs two 8825 controllers. During initial install one of the controllers failed. Wouldn't communicate with thermostats or pc. Unit was replaced for free and has worked since. Now, after little more than a year, the second unit has failed in the same way. These things cost around $600 each, and although I can probably get this second unit replaced under warranty, I feel nervous about the longevity of the unit. So concerned that I feel the need to buy a spare to put on the shelf. Another gripe is that the web interface with this product is very clunky. To make matters worse, the latest version of Java does not work with the device. Be prepared to keep a dedicated PC handy, running old software, to adjust the thermostat programs.Overall experience ""C-"""
1,Multiple units failed the same way,"I installed the 8825 with three 8870s. Functionality was fine, although the browser interface is rather crude. This unit is based on the Homelogic Climate Brick which has similarly crude software.My first 8825 failed after one year, and the factory replaced it. The replacement failed after 6 months, but I was able to resurrect it with a firmware upgrade utility. The replacement has now failed completely, and Tech Support tells me to buy a new one. For nearly $800, I am giving up on Aprilaire and probably moving to Proliphix. I like the Proliphix direct access from the internet better than the kludgy way I have to access the Aprilaire 8825 from the internet.In each failure case, the symptom was the same -- the unit seemed to be on but gave no response to a web browser, and did not communicate with the thermostats.I recommend you look at other products."
4,Great Accessories,"Just the tripod alone was worth the price. And you get the smaller tripod too? Amazing! The lens cleaner kit is very handy. I don't use the card reader although I am sure it will come in handy someday. The camera bag is just big enough for the camera,SD cards, batteries, lens cleaner, and few other small items. If you are want to fit a bigger lens you're out of luck. But it serves a purpose and protects my camera. I would like it to be bigger but it will do. I think this a great buy perfect for a beginner photographer like myself."
1,photo bag deception,"i purchased this accessory kit in hopes of receiving the camera bag as depicted in the photo shown as being what was in the kit. it turns out the ""camera bag"" was a belt pouch smaller than a pack of cigarettes. and the mini tri-pod is about 5"" inches tall. i called the distributor of this offer (not amazon) about this and was sent another belt bag that is still useless. i would not recommend this kit. photo is totally deceptive."
5,Great deal!,"Buying all of these things in one large bundle rather than buying each thing individually was a great save on $$! And each piece is of great quality and strong, sturdy, and very eye-catching. Thanks Amazon!"
1,Camera Bag,Camera bag and accesories were just as described. Was a gift so have not heard how everything is once in use.
2,Disappointing: Many CD without track/title/song info,"In truth it's hard to complain too much because the advertised album does come as advertised (Bob Dylan In Concert: Brandeis University, 1963 [Limited Edition, Live]) however the additional CD's all seem to be homemade? They are unadorned CD's (appear to be CD-R's) with only basic name info on them. They have NO track, title, artist, year, etc info on them.. as if someone just made an unlabeled CD. The closest I can come to figuring out what they are is when one of them does find enough internet information (Windows Media Player rip process) to be identified as the ""Interview Box Set"", but even it has no other information on the CD. If this was supposed to be part of a professional box set then someone did a poor job of making a bootleg copy, and if it is supposed to be a professional release then someone needs their job on the chopping block"
2,Terrible compared to OEM.,"Got these because I couldn't find what the OEM used, which was the Philips H11 Long Life bulbs.The Sylvania's were not near as bright as the original Philips, when the Philips were fresh and over time, they got dimmer much quicker then the Philips bulbs.Now, I'm looking for the Philips H11 and the only place I can find them is from a company in the UK. It amazes me that I can't find them here in the States, when they come as the OEM bulb in the Camary."
4,The con is on,"After falling in love with this series, it stopped coming on television. On a whim I did a search on Amazon, and found the dvd sets here. Great program, well worth checking out."
2,Not for me,"The music is nice, and he seems like a thoughtful instructor, but I don't want to look at a man without his shirt on the whole time."
2,Love Scott Cole but the DVD was damaged/scratched,"Scott Cole is a wonderful Tai Chi artist and teacher. He progresses through the movements smoothly and you learn without even realizing that you are learning. The music and background scenes are perfect. The BIG problem I had is that the DVD was scratched. Sometimes it played and other times I had to wait while it was ""skipping over damage areas"". I don't remember if this was supposed to be a used or new DVD from MovieMars via Amazon.com. The problem is I haven't had time to return/exchange the DVD. I'd recommend buying a brand new DVD via Amazon.com or purchasing the DVD directly from [...]. It is worth it!"
1,miss,This DVD more like Qikong to me and it was not worth to buy it. It isn't for beginner to learn the taichi. So don't but it.
5,Perfect for Beginners,Checked this out at the Library and liked it enough to own it! Scott Cole is exceptional at making the complex art of Tai Chi very simple for beginners....avoiding intimidation and intellectualizing. Watching this video makes you jump right up and start doing the moves! You are doing Tai Chi within 5 minutes and enjoying it :)
4,Tai Chi for Beginners,"I think for someone who has studied Tai Chi before, this is a perfect video to pick up and maybe learn a few things about the history and reasoning of Tai Chi workouts.I'm glad I've studied before because in some parts, we went right into putting all of the moves together and I was a little confused. Had I been a brand new practitioner, I never would have kept up or even knew what was going on.I like Scott's way of teaching as he goes and explaining each and every stance and position. It really helped me understand the whats and where fors of that particular move/position.Overall, this was a great purchase and I'm very happy I got it."
3,Eh...it was ok....,"Scott Cole, is obviously knowledgeable...but a lot of the moves he practices are mixed up. He goes from Tai Chi, and switching right in the middle to certain Qi Gong exercises. There's no real explanation as to what he's doing and when.May be okay for beginners...I rented one from the library that much more informative:Tai chi for beginnersProduced by Dragonfly Productions; directed by Andrea AmbandosMuch more informative, starts with Qi gong, ends with putting it all together."
4,Excellent way to learn Tai Chi for beginners,I like very much the way Scott teaches Tai Chi. He makes it very easy. The exercises are gentle but effective. His voice is very soothing and has a lovely personality.
4,nice,since walking is a problem I went to this.It really helps and I enjoy it a lot get upfeeling good and the warm up is wonderfuleven if I don't get a chance to do the forms
4,Recommended,"I bought this DVD a few weeks ago & I really like it. It moves slowly enough that, as a beginner, I can easily follow along.I bought it because I wanted to take a Tai Chi class but I did not want to enter a class and not be able to keep up. This particular DVD does not teach very many poses, so I think I would probably purchase a more intermediate video before I jumped into a class."
3,Scratchy audio,"I purchased Scott's original Tai Chi for Beginners from 2002 and absolutely loved it. However, after many years of use, it got scratches on it, so I decided to reorder it. Imagine my surprise when I found that it is selling for over $50. But I saw that they rerecorded it in 2009 for a reasonable sale price and I ordered it. It is the identical DVD except that the first one I received had a very distracting audio hiss that is evident every few minutes. I returned that one and got a second DVD and it has the identical hiss. Must be something in the rerecording process. Disappointing."
4,Good basic video,"I have wanted to learn some Tai Chi for awhile and figured a dvd like this would be a good start. He teaches you some of the basic moves. If you are just looking to try Tai Chi out before going to some school, then this is the one for you."
4,A leatherman for those who don't need to do everything.,"After many years of hard use, I lost my PST. I tried living with out it but it just became to hard, so I needed a replacement. I used to work in theater, so a full functioned leatherman came in handy, and when the Wave came out, it was going to be my next purchase. However I have reached a point where I don't need the extra knife blades, saw, file etc. I didn't even need some of the features I had in the PST. The S2 packages everything I need in a slick, compact but functional package. If I KNEW I was going to be lost in the wilderness, I would want the Wave. But for everyday use, the Juice is elegantly efficient. And if I DO get lost in the wilderness, I'll be okay.Only downside is that it came without a holster. It's small enough to pocket, but when I have keys and cell phone in pocket, I like to move some weight out of there."
2,"Would give it 5 stars, but it broke...","Had it for 2 weeks. Used pliers to loosen a hand-tightened door stop, and the tool literally broke in half. I barely applied pressure...I've sent it back for replacement (leatherman warranties tools for 25 years). Hopefully it was a defect. We'll see.It is very snazzy, though. Looks great, nice weight and balance, very sharp blade. Aesthetically, it's top-notch."
5,"Had it for years, bought one for my Dad and all my brothers.",This thing is just plain useful and easy to bring along (except on planes). I've had this for somewhere between 5 to 7 years I'd rate it as nearly indispensable for those of us to refuse to wear these things on our belts unless camping or hiking.
5,A touching tale about the need to be loved & friendship.,"I found this in the discard pile at my local library, and 'adopted' it. My 2-year-old daughter loves this gentle story of a little dog who yearns for food, and most importantly love. He roams the streets looking for scraps, and eventually makes his way to a gallery, in which he finds an artist, Rosa, who seems to be only able to paint dark, and bleak paintings. She provides Little Dog food and a home, and comes to love him, just as she finds his irrepressible spirit contagious and starts to paint visions of color and brightness. This is a great story of love, and friendship and is appealing to all ages."
5,Not a razorback.,"This is NOT a Razorback as the images indicate.You get exactly what the title specifies:""Games Workshop Space Marine Rhino Box Set""I expected this but was 1/2 hoping to get a little bonus since the price was cheap for a razor."
4,I like my humvee more,"My humvee isn't that great with IED blasts, but it does hecka better than this thing. Granted, I think the humvee is built better, but yeah. However, as long as you're not dealing with 2000lb bombs buried in the road by a turban-wearing bacon-hater, this thing does ok."
5,Saskia rules the world of Jazz,"There is now a kinder, friendlier person in the field of Jazz. Saskia Laroo plays for the people while still being innovative. She does an excellent tribute album for Miles, but you can tell that she has been given the torch from past legends. She has written two tunes for this CD, ""Spin"" and ""Good Morning Dr. Laroo."" Besides being good tunes, they exhibit her talent as the consummate Jazz artist (musician/writer.)The tune ""Bye Bye Blackbird"" shows that she has tenderness behind her honest music. Also on the CD are ""Spin,"" ""Blue In Green,"" ""St. Thomas,"" ""Good Morning Dr. Laroo,"" My Funny Valentine,"" ""Perdido,"" ""Doxy,"" ""But Not For Me,"" ""Round Midnight,"" and ""So What.""Personnel: Saskia Laroo, trumpet - Albert Sarko, Piano-Jos Machtel, bass- Martin van Duynhoven, drums"
5,Worked well But Expensive upgrade,I needed to install sony dvd burner on my dell dimension 8100.I got two modules of 128 MB (total 256)from Amazon and added to existing 128(2 X 64). It worked fine and no trouble. Remember you need to install in pairs for a data bank. One more important point install higher memory modules bank close to processor.Fnally I installed my Dvd burner. No problems so far.But this rdram is expensive when compared to other types of RAM.
4,"Excellent resource for advanced beginners, but should not include exercises.","This little book is an excellent resource for beginners and advanced beginners. Most of the stories of the little frustrations of life in Italy are told via conversations. This is different from many texts for foreign language learners, but is not a substitute for prose works. On the other hand, half the book consists of exercises, which should really be sold as a separate book for those who actually want it, instead of charging $20 for this book! Furthermore, the answer key is sold separately for $3.50!"
3,needs improvement,"My professor(who is a statistician) pointed out several problems in this text. Some times he was just in awe of the serious mistakes and liberties taken in this book. One that comes to mind is Mario's use of the Z-test when (in certain circumstances) really it would have been more accurate to use the T-test. Also, there are many little mistakes that should have been corrected by the seventh edition (in some of the examples etc). The book is okay if your just taking the course for a general ed. requirement...My professor, who himself has authored many high-level math textbooks found the book to be problematic. Perhaps there is a difference of opinion on the Z- versus t-test. Hopefully, the little mistakes (that aren't controversial) will be corrected before any new editions are published!"
2,"Good idea, but useless in my case.","This Product is a great idea, but I never got it working right. Im living in Europe and this product does only support NTSC, so this product is not useable in Europe. If you live in a concrete house, you might have to use Wired-Ethernet-connection between your extender and your computer, because when using Wireless connection, the extender has to be nearly on top of the router to get all the wireless connection it needs.In the user-manual it says that the extender can operate @ 100-240V but the technical support doesn't believe you can use 240V.And for those who don't know: MS Media Center 2005 does not support DivX.So in my case, this product is not worth it, but I give it 2 stars for the idea."
1,Needs XP Media Edition 2005,This product will not work with any other OS except Windows XP Media Edition 2005. It won't even work with Windows XP Pro SP2 with the Media Connect patch. I'm taking it back.
2,Smoke and Mirrors,"This device seems to be cool, but has a lot of drawbacks.1. It does not allow you to watch your DVDs2. It will not be compatible with Windows Vista3. You cannot browse Internet using it4. It does not support Dolby Digital 5.15. There is a USNB port that is not supported (kiss your keyboard good bye)It does a great job for watching pictures, recorded TV shows, having a glance at your email, weather, news and watching live TV, though.My recommendation is not to buy this device because it is already obsolete (can you believe it?!?). Wait for the next generation, compatible with Vista that is right on the corner for launching."
2,Plagued by network congestion,"A great concept, but the reality is that it constantly pauses or hangs, complaining of network congestion. I'm using 802.11g; I tried the dual-band Linksys router, and results were worse on 802.11a.Not ready for prime time."
5,Great!,"I needed black treacle to make sticky toffee pudding, and could only find it online. I am grateful that it was not too expensive and that it came so quickly!"
3,Madcap Running Gags,"When I first started watching this I thought it was horrible. It took me days to resume watching it after 30 minutes.But then I started seeing it in a new light.Apparently it is a filmed version of a Broadway play Allen wrote.It has to viewed as another of his slapstick comedies, like Take the Money and Run or BananasJust a series of gags. Rather consciously conceived I think like a Marx Bros. movie where the premises are all over the top.All the characters are cartoons and I think the movie gets funnier and funnier as it goes along."
2,don't Drink The Water,As a Woody Allen fan I didn't remember this one so I ordered it. It was OK but certainly not up to the standard of his movies of the past few years. There were a few funny spots but not a real winner.
4,PREDICTABLE BUT FUN,"This 1994 TV movie had a great cast and plenty of chuckles along the way. It cleverly points out how crazy the Cold War era was with it intrigues and weird characters, and of course, Michael J. Fox adds to the beat as an incompetent bureaucractic bozo. It will likely not go down as one of the classics of the 20th Century, but it sure was entertaining and a happy way to spend an evening. The popcorn and hot fudge sundies added to a delightful time in the family living room. I liked it. Several family members laughed out loud, often complimenting Woody and Crew."
4,Great fun!,"I enjoyed the film very much. Good high energy performances (and far superior to the Jackie Gleason/Estelle Parsons early '60s version....Gleason, who was brilliant in so many other areas, just couldn't get this right).Correction: Allen's wife is not played by Julie Hagerty (ref ""Airplane"" and ""Lost in America,"" but Julie Kavner, who had appeared with Allen previously in ""Oedipus Wrecks,"" from the short film compilation, ""New York Stories."""
1,Woody's Worst?,"My wife and I are great Woody Allen fans. While we have most of his movies, this is one we missed. Based on the high Amazon ratings, we ordered it. What a dog of a movie! Michael J. Fox, Dom DeLuise and the girl playing Woody's daughter stink. Their combined horrible acting brings down the movie. Casting Fox in this role is beyond comprehension! His ""acting"" was pathedtic. He couldn't stand still for even a few seconds in a scene. Woody should have burned all copies since this leaves a bad taste for his other great films. Save your money on this one. Clearly it is Woody's Worst! I never trust those five star ratings again."
5,great item,"I have used this trap before and it is fabulous, works great, catches lots of gophers and is incredibly easy to use."
1,2.5 months no rodents traped,"have used this product as directed in known rodent (rat) areas. Well concealed, well baited. Rats ran right over it to only get caught on my cheap glue traps. waste of money. will try it on gophers, hopefully it will work better"
2,it doesn't kill them--just tortures them,I did very well for the first 6 or so gophers but now the trap is not killing them. Poor little things are just being held captive but not killed. Very inhumane way of getting rid of gophers.
5,The Thing Rocks !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I had tried everything. This is the best. I just wish I had more to catch. This is a toy boys will love. It eliminated my problem. I caught 3 in 4 hours. If you have gophers .......... this will eliminate them.
1,I don't expect that there is anything wrong with this unit.,I expect that I'm not skilled enough to snare these willy gophers. I need an expert to come do this for me but where or where is there a person like that...
1,not for my garden,worked for my sister with decomposed granite type soil. Does not work for me with clay- loam soil in IL. Never caught a thing with this. Waste of $.
2,A lot of money for two plastic things that I can't get to work,"I read the directions, I have talked with someone who has used them and yet I am watching as the buggers still eat through my garden. I am not sure why these things are so expensive. I bought two of them and have not had any luck catching one gopher. In fact they are eating around them! I have tried moving them, putting them together, spreading them apart and nothing is working."
2,Rodent trap,Never had a chance to use it. Had to call in a exterminator for the rats in my back yard. Returned trap
1,Trapped rodent destroys plastic trip paddle by chewing.,"I bought 4 of these to trap chipmunks. Worked great for two years, but now the plastic trip paddles are destroyed by the chewing of dying chipmunks rendering the $22.00 traps useless. If the paddles were metal the traps would be perfect. Do not buy if you have a queazy stomach."
5,Black Hole Rodent Trap,Works extremely well. Have caught several pocket gophers in it. I Would recommend this item to anyone with a mole or gopher problem.
4,Trapping Gophers in WI,The trap didn't come with much for instruction so we didn't have any luck at first. However when I emailed the company for instructions they were extremely prompt with their response. My husband got 4 gophers in the next few days! We have tried several other traps and 'smoke bombs' in the past with no real luck. The gophers haven't been quite as active this spring given the wierd weather we've been having but we're hoping this is finally the answer!
4,Gopher Trapping in Cali,"Great gopher trap! I rated it four stars because it didn't kill the gopher, but the nice part was the trap design made it easy to clean up. I just carried the trap with gopher inside over to the trash, released the spring and dropped the body into the trash. If it would have killed the gopher I would have given it five stars. This was my first time gopher trapping so it was nice that the trap worked on my second try within 45 minutes of setting the trap. I would definitely buy this again."
5,Three Squirrels in 24 hours,It works. It just works. Bait it with sunflower seeds and put it where the rodents play. Poor things....they're so stupid.
5,Mole Killing Machine,"I have had this trap for a number of years and it is a mole catching machine. The hit rate per setting is about 3 out of 4. The only time I have missed is when I guess wrong about which side of the tunnel the mole is on. Just make sure to put some soil on the bottom of the trap so it seems like part of the hole and seal off the edges with dirt leaving the small hole at the back clear, and you got yourself a kill. The one thing moles cant stand is an open hole. They will show up to plug it."
5,THE CURRENT GREAT PHYSICISTS ALL IN ONE BOOK,"This book of insightful and sometimes very witty presentations to honor this very courageous icon of science and mathematical physicist is MUST reading for all Physicists and Applied Mathematicians who want to get a glimse of the great minds of the past 40 years. I enjoyed every page. You do not need a PhD to comprehend this book, just a solid scientific and mathematical foundation. Good reading, fellow scientists and mathematicians! Prof Dan Remy (ret)"
4,Anything's Possible is Excellent,"I never thought I needed this kind of book. I have always been a very hard worker and have accomplished a fair amount. But Curtis urged me to read it. Since I knew the author, I thought I ought to. I was surprised! It made a big difference in my life. I now am able to deal with my stress more effectively. My obstacles seem less overwhelming. My life is more balanced. My direction is clear. And my attitude is more positive. My life is much better.I recommend this book to all. I also recommend that you meet Curtis. His passionate, humble spirit is contagious."
4,Wonderful and Inspiring Read,"This book was so wonderful that I have recommended it to several of my friends. It has clear and concise ways of setting goals, managing them and shooting for a dream. Recommended read for someone who is interested in planning their future with or without a current goal."
4,works fine,I have had this for three months and it works well. Just pump and spray. great for just a light coat of oil and whatever.
1,Horrible product! Waste of money!,"I bought this item because of the relatively good reviews, but I wish I hadn't. Right out of the box the thing didn't work. No matter how long I pumped it never got firm and built up enough pressure to spray a mist. It's a piece of junk. I would give it 0 stars but I have to pick at least one."
5,works great,Better than I expectedI am using this for 3-weeks with Olive oilso far it is working great. This spraysproduce better/finer/ results than Spray oil cans.
1,Not Functional,"This product was greatly disappointing. I followed directions faithfully about angles of use, amount of fill, etc. Still, the unit did not function properly. Most times it produced no spray at all. Some times it produced a thin stream (but not a spray). I have rarely found Amazon-purchased products to be poor, but this one ended up in the trash."
1,Horrible Item - olive oil leaks everywhere!,Something with the design of the item is off ... the nozzle mists fine for a couple of secs .. but then loses its pressure.But more important ... olive oil comes out at the sides of the canister ... pretty shoddy material design!
1,Won't work at all!!!,"I've pumped and pumped and get nothing. The nozzle won't even press down. It's pretty simple so I don't think I can be doing something wrong and I've used misters in the past. Wasted my money on what I thought was ""the best."""
2,Disappointed.,"I was so excited to finally get a misto. I'm trying to turn over a new healthy leaf. Unfortunately after using it for about a month and a half (outside my window of return) it stopped spraying. I can't figure out why it stopped working, and I used it only according to the directions. bummer.Part II, after reading other comments, I tried soaking the inner mechanism in hot water to 'de-gunk'it and it worked! MIsto spraying again! Still should not need that kind of maintenance but at least it's spraying again."
1,Leaks and I Couldn't Get it to Work,"After reading the other reviews I was sure this was for me to use with my new removable-plates George Foreman Grill.I washed the oil canister out and let air dry for a day, then filled with olive oil and pumped. Barely any came out. Repeated the steps with same results.My son accidentally knocked it over, and oil was slowly dripping out. We played with it for over a week because I was determined to get it to work - the other reviews make it sound so easy. Unfortunately, not easy for me.I'll stick with Pam (ha ha - didn't even mean to make that joke)."
1,USELESS!!!,"TRASH!!!! TRASH!!!! TRASH!!!! TRASH!!!! TRASH!!!!I did everything according to the instruction. The oil cannot be sprayed out! USELESS!!!Now, they don't allow me to return it. The product is a piece of junk!!! A WASTE of money!!!!!"
3,NEED FOR REPLACEMENT PARTS FOR MISTO PRODUCT.,I HAVE A MISTO OLIVE OIL SPRAYER THAT I RECEIVED IT AS A BIRTHDAY GIFT IN DECEMBER. ABOUT A WEEK AGO THE WHITE PLASTIC TUBE THAT IS LOCATED IN THE CAP THAT IS USED FOR A PISTON TO PUMP AIR INTO THE TANK BROKE OFF AT THE BOTTON AND I CAN NO LONGER USE THE PRODUCT AS DESIGNED BECAUSE OF A DEFECTIVE PART. I WOULD LIKE TO OBTAIN THE NECESSARY REPLACEMENT PART AND IF POSSIBLE A SPARE TO INSURE CONTINUED USE OF A GREAT PRODUCT. PLEASE LET ME KNOW HOW TO PROCEED TO OBTAIN THE NEEDED REPLACEMENT PART. IT LOOKS LIKE OTHERS ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM WITH BROKEN PLUMGERS. SOME IMPROVEMENT IN THE PLASTIC USED FOR THE PLUMGER MIGHT BE CONSIDERED. HAPPY CONSUMERS ARE THE BEST FORM OF ADVERTIZING.
3,Okay Product,"When I received my Misto sprayer, it was dented and had to be returned. When I received a new, I thought it worked okay. I haven't used it as much as I thought I would so I didn't give it a high rating."
3,Good as far as I can tell.,"This was a gift for my daughter-in-law so I haven't actually used it. It did have the highest rating of all those I researched, but all reviews seem to complaint that eventually the oil in the mister comes out in a stream. Hopefully, if my DIL follows the directions, that will not be a problem."
1,Terrible ...,"The bad reviews are right ... works at first BUT soon leaks, gums up, clogs, lid does not stay down because of the pressure ... don't waste your money. I eventually threw mine in the trash."
5,Nifty Gizmo,"I've had one of these for about 10 years. It still works great.Right now, I'm using Grape Seed Oil in it but I used Olive Oil too.I spray air popped popcorn and sprinkle black pepper and nutritional yeast on the popcorn. The Misto sprays just enough oil so the pepper and yeast ""stick"". It's SO much healthier than Microwave popcorn.I also spray poultry and fish before cooking so they have just enough oil and don't stick.I've given these for gifts too.They're easy to clean but you have to remember to clean them so they don't get gummed up and stop misting.A Positive alternative to Pam type sprays."
4,Good product,The Misto Gourmet Olive Oil Sprayer works just as it is explained. I use it instead of aerosol spray cans. This way I know exactly what I am spraying and save money as well.
3,"Sprays, but also makes a mess","Looks okay, works okay, but nothing great. I was using it for spraying vinegar on salad. I found it more of a pain than just pouring it on. You have to de-pressurize it before setting aside or the top won't go down all the way. Also seemed to get messy and drippy. Not as good as it could have been. I stopped using it."
3,Decent Sprayer,"I have had this sprayer for a few months and it has held up well, being used quite regularly. My big complaint with the product is that it creates a lot of airborne dispersion, like a can of underarm deodorant. I thought it would be a more elegant alternative to my re-purposed ""I Can't Believe It's Not Butter"" spray margarine container - but that little plastic bottle gives a more uniform and directional spray without fogging the kitchen. When the Misto stops working, I will not buy an identical replacement."
5,Perfecto!,"Got this for CHristmas 'cause I needed it for my expensive non stick pans that tell you not to use Pam because the chemicals will degrade the non stick surface. So I got this and am thrilled! Totally works! Only had it a month or so, so haven't had any issues yet, but I'm thrilled."
3,Great while it worked,"Worked great, but after about 6 months the small white rim of plastic at the bottom of plunger side got a small crack, and now it's useless."
5,The best for healthy cooking,"The Misto Gourmet Sprayer is fantastic. I bought 3 and use them for olive oil for cooking, lemon juice and walnut oil for salads. I could not be happier. These spray at a rate exactly like a Pam Spray from the store, only you can choose what type of oil you would like to use. It is perfect for lemon juice or vinegar also. Excellent choice for healthy cooking and eating!"
4,So far so good!,"I've only had this for about a week, but so far I love it! Seems well made, and is much more covenient than buying those expensive sprays at the supermarket."
2,PIA Product,"Perhaps if you are just using this to spray a little oil on your food, it's ok. But it sucks for baking. I don't used the pressurized oils like Pam since they leave behind a film after baking that doesn't wash off. So I really wanted something that could spray *just* oil. BUT I can only get 5 muffin wells sprayed before it's 15 pumps. So for 12 muffins that's 45 pumps. And the spray IS uneven--it doesn't coat well at all. It's just easier to dip a paper towel in margarine and wipe it on."
5,BRILLIANT,"I LOVE this thing. I followed the directions, filling only half way and the like, and it works perfectly! When the whether was cold (and oil gets thicker) just to be safe I placed it in a warmer area. I always release the pressure and never over pump. I have had it for a year and never had a problem..If taken care of this thing is perfect."
1,Works great for a couple of months,I have had two of these and both stopped working after a while. All they do is spray a solid stream of oil not a mist. I have washed them and they are not over filled and they still do not work.
2,Didn't last long,"Due to some heart complications, we primarily use olive oil. Olive oil is expensive enough, and the spray is even higher, so the sprayer seemed like the way to go. This sprayer does not hold much pressure, and it would send out a stream rather than a spray. When the oil level gets low, it requires a lot of pumping, and it was easily overpressured by my wife and blew out the seals. Very cheaply made."
2,It does not work as suppose to be,"We bought 2 units and just using starts to fail and it does not trough anything, it is too tricky to operate"
5,Great for Kale Chips!,"I bought this sprayer for use on lots of items, but especially on roasting vegetables and making Kale chips. I used to buy Olive Oil from PAM but this way I can use higher quality oil and not pay for extra cans.The Misto comes with short and easy directions, is easy to fill neatly and easy to pump and use. It's a perfect size and looks nice, too. Overall I am very happy with it."
2,Another drawer stuffer.,Not worth the trouble of filling & cleaning up. Much easier to buy reg. olive oil cooking spray. I will try to heed my on advice in the future.
2,Didn't Last,"The Misto Gourmet Olive Oil Sprayer spayed well for a few months. Then the spray turned into just a stream of oil. The first few times, just cleaning out the nozzle fixed the problem. After that, it couldn't be fixed. I bought it because my Pampered Chef one melted next to the stove, but they are really expensive. Maybe you really do ""get what you pay for."""
3,needs a better nozzle,"this is a decent sprayer. I like the pump mechanisim. However the nozzle seems to be low quality. the pressure has to be just right to get a good mist. sometimes it spays a steady steam, sometimes the oil just dribbles out. even when i do get a mist, it seems too fine and much of it blows away or simply dissipates into the air."
5,works well,I purchased this some time ago and it works just like you would want it to. I like that it allows me to use my own oil rather than the expensive spray cans. Works as advertised!
2,Sprayer broke after 2 months,"I would give this three stars while it was working. It does basically what you would think, but aerolizes more than I would like. The mist is too fine. What I really wanted was a sprayer that would act like more like a cleaning bottle spray. Pump spray, I guess.In any case, the spray nozzle broke on my Misto after two months of light use."
2,Limited Useful Life,It works great for a number of uses and then the spray becomes a stream. No amount of cleaning helps.
1,Spray nozzle clogged up after first use,"This was a big disappointment. Some reviewers warned that the nozzle would clog up, but we thought if we carefully followed the directions and warnings given by other reviewers we could avoid this fate.No luck. After only one use, the nozzle clogged up. It now just spews out globs of oil and we don't use it at all. Still can't bring ourselves to throw a new product in the trash after only 2-3 uses yet.Even on big discount, this was a complete waste of money."
1,Don't like it,"More often than not, the oil comes out in a stream rather than a mist. When it does mist, it's not an even pattern and is very messy. Definitely not one of my better purchases."
5,GREAT kitchen device,"I absolutely love this device. You just fill it up with your oil of preference (I use extra virgin oliveoil) and use it instead of no-stick spray, or to cover homemade fries, evenly spray a salad etc. None of those additives you get from the store bought cans and you also save the environment since you can simply refill it when it runs out.The can's pressure is created by pumping the lid up and down a few times (which i did not figure out immidiately) and then it is good to go.HIGHLY recommend this! You use less oil (=healthier and better for the purse) + you skip out on all the chemical stuff that are added to no-stick sprays."
4,"Great money saving device, one thing to watch out for","We had our first Misto sprayer for a couple of years before it stopped working. We recycled it and bought another from Amazon. The one we purchased arrived but did not work. Amazon, of course, remedied the problem right away and sent a replacement which worked fine. It seemed to be a fluke. I figured out that the first, defective device did not have a small rubber/plastic ring to keep the pressure in the can when you pump it. This tiny little missing piece kept the whole thing from working. Check yours for the plastic ring before you put oil in it!"
3,Meh,"Maybe there is some trick to it I haven't discovered, but I don't like the quality of the spray. I think I've used it only twice since I bought it. I can't recommend it personally."
4,Looove it!,"I love the idea of using a high quality oil in a reusable spritzer, The only thing I can find ""wrong"" with it is that occasionally the nozzle seems to clog up a bit and the spritz turns into a stream."
2,Pump doesn't work,I have tried several times for this pump to spray a mist instead of big clumps. I have followed the manufacturers instructions but to no avail. I can pour out of a bottle of olive oil and get the same results.
2,The Sprayer that doesn't,This sprayer only sprays half the time. The other half it just leaves a strip of oil behind. I'm really disappointed in this product.
5,Liked it so musch bought a second....,"Intially bought one to store Olive Oil. Used it daily for pans, salads and sandwiches. Bought a second for Canola Oil. Completely eliminates PAM and other sprays. Very green...."
2,Clogged up,I loved this thing for about 3 weeks. Then it clogged and now I still am unable to use. Bummer.
5,IMisto sprayer,I really enjoy the Misto sprayer! It is such a great idea and helps to keep my cooking healthy. Use it for many different dishes to help things to not stick and for salads.
4,;0),I have been using this spry bottle for 3 months now and so far its good. I put my olive oil in pump and spray. I didn't find it to be messy and when pump enough with built up pressure it sprays great.
2,great when it works,Have bought 3 of these and each one worked great until it didn't. Am now looking for another mister that hopefully will last.
4,keep on pumping,"Does a good job, but make sure you follow the instructions and maintain it properly. The spray has to be maintained to function well."
5,shipping and package in good condition,The shipping was fast and the package in good shape! This is an awesome sprayer and saves a lot of oil and a lot of calories on top of cholesterol! ENJOY!
1,Broke within 3 months,"Although the brushed aluminum body is very stylish, the product parts are incredibly cheap. The sprayer works by creating air pressure in an internal canister as you pump the cover, which allows you to spray oil as a mist. Unfortunately, the plastic tube, which is supposed to force air into the nozzle, is so flimsy that this product broke almost immediately. It is no longer able to force air into the spray nozzle, so it cannot spray a mist.I would recommend trying a different brand. It may cost a little more, but you get what you pay for."
1,Sprayer stopped popping back up after about 5 sprays,"I understand you have to pump this to get pressure in, but all the pressure in the world won't work if the sprayer head itself gets jammed DOWN and won't come back up - and that's with spraying a mixture that's 99% water! It's lovely to look at, and WHEN it sprays it's lovely and even, but fighting with it after every 5th spray is enough of a hassle that I switched back to my cheapy plastic sprayer that works every time...."
2,Mold,I really liked this but it got really gross black mold very easily. It doesn't spray exactly like a Pam or other type spray but it does still work.
4,Misto Olive Oil Sprayer,"This oil sprayer is a terrific little tool everyone should have in their kitchen. I have been using mine now for over 20 months, with no clogging. Perfect even spraying time after time."
4,Oil in a spraycan with no extra chemicals!,"This is a great little bottle, but do heed the advice of other reviewers and let out the air after each use. Also, it's been my experience that the spray isn't quite as effective for use in non-stick pans, I guess the propellant used in PAM and other commercial sprays also helps stuff not to stick..."
5,Love it!,I got my Misto about 2 months ago. I purchased to use as an alternative to store bought sprays. I also like the idea of infusing my own oil (although I haven't done this quite yet) to spray. I filled it about half way as per the reviews - and have had no problems. It works like a charm. :)
1,Piece O' Caca,"I'm planning on returning this if possible. I read all the reviews, but their promises that this puppy actually works were wrong. It's like the others we've tried: Follow the directions, do as you're told, even try the secret tips provided by other reviewers, and you still end up with a pathetic little drizzle in your pan. It would be great if someone someday figures out how to make a mister that performs as promised, but so far, this one ain't it."
1,"""Dribble-O"" or ""Squirto"" maybe. Mist? Don't bet on it.","So Misto promises to replace expensive store-bought aerosol cans with a product that will spray a fine mist of oil just like they do, but for only (in the long-term, anyway) pennies a can.HA!!I followed the directions verbatim, but no matter what kind of oil I tried... corn, canola, olive..., and no matter how much I pumped it up, all it would do is dribble out a pathetic stream.Possibly the most undeservedly-hyped product I've ever fallen for... should be ZERO stars!"
1,pure junk,I cannot figure out for the life of my how others have gotten this thing to work. It seems like a great idea and I use olive oil so much. I filled it only 3 oz as the directions said to. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
1,Worked great at first. Clogs too easily. In the trash now.,"Great concept that worked great at first. But it really does require all the extra steps that other reviewers mentioned -- only fill it halfway, pump it after each use, etc etc. Clogs too easily to be worth the extra effort. Just buy those EVOO 0 calorie sprays, save yourself the disappointment. My Misto is in the garbage now."
2,Not as bad as first thought (updated review),"I initially wrote an unfair review of this product. It's not as bad as I first thought. Other brand misters I had I was able to fill with oil whereas this unit really can't cope with any more than half full (I am sure other people put that info in their reviews as well). So as long as I don't need a lot of oil in the mister, it works fine-ish. I still get the odd squirt / jet instead of a mist spray but it works fine for my grill. I give this 3/5."
1,"Yes, Really Does Clog No Matter How Careful","Very disappointed. Not that it really even worked that great when it did work (mist was too light), but now just shoots a stream of oil. Luckily Trader Joe's started carrying Extra Virgin Olive Oil version of PAM, which works great, and isn't too terribly expensive."
5,It's great for salads!,I really like the Misto. I use it to spray the olive oil on the salads. I'll have to buy a couple more for vinegar. Just make sure you release the pressure after each use to prevent from clogging. That way it'll last longer.
4,Worth it to save calories and not use propellents,Nice and you just need to remember to pmp it before use. Looks good sitting on the counter as well for grab and use.
1,Junk,"Like many other 1 & 2 star reviewers, my misto worked for about a week or two. Now, it just sprays jets of oil, no matter how much (or how little) it's pumped. Cleaning it has not helped. Total waste of money."
2,Not the best,"Quick summary, pump doesn't work the best. I have owned it for about 2 years now, but I rarely use it. This is one item I have bought that I was disappointed in and felt the need to write a review :("
1,don't make them like they used to,This will be our third Misto Gourment sprayer. The first 2 last a reasonable amount of time. This one broke the first week - plastic piece broke off almost immediately. What a piece of junk. Wish someone would make a durable mister as it is a great tool to have in the kitchen.
1,Doesn't last,"This ""sprayer"" worked great, for about two months. Thereafter, it squirts, not sprays. Tried cleaning it but no help. It's headed to the trash can. Back to the dish and brush for me."
5,"Perfect, no more chemical tasting sprays",A non-stick spray for a lot of dishes is critical however the non-stick sprays you get at the grocery store are expensive and have chemicals in them that not only taste bad but probably shouldn't be put in your body in the first place. With the Misto you can use any oil you like (I use light extra-virgin olive oil). You add pressure by pumping the top and it sprays evenly. Looks nice on the kitchen counter too.
2,expected better quality but then again it's pretty cheap,"My Misto arrived with a missing part - rubber washer between the bottom container and the plastic pump. When I got it, I tried and tried, but nothing would work - no pressure and no spray. Then I opened it up and put some saran wrap around the lip of the pump, where it contacts the top brim of the bottom container. That did the trick. Seems to be working fine, but I wish it came... more completely assembled. Disappointed."
5,Misto Gourmet,This replaced an old olive oil sprayer that was no longer functional. The new sprayer works better than the old one ever did. For the cost it can't be beat. I highly recommend this.
5,Works great,I use this to lightly coat teflon with olive oil and it really does the job. It looks good setting on the counter top by the stove.
2,"so far, not so great","I tried it this morning. I get lots of small drippy spurts followed by a burst of air. Still trying to see if something is clogged, if I have it too full, or if there is some other form of operator error. I want this to work!"
1,becomes rancid-smelling very quickly,"I would love to be able to spray my oil, but noticed with the Misto the device started smelling like rancid oil very quickly, and I was unable to remove the smell. Tried soaking in dish suds, didn't work, even tried 409 in desperation and it still didn't work. Now I just use a brush, cheaper and non-rancid."
1,cheap and junky,This mister broke before I finished the first bottle of spray. The plastic piece at the top cracked and the unit would no longer develop pressure and therefore spray. It is cheaply made and I strongly recommend spending a couple extra dollars for a better quality sprayer.
3,Misto,"I bought this item because I use a lot of olive oil spray and I hate throwing all the cans in the garbage. It's a nice idea, but does not work very well. The oil capacity and pressure capacity is too small. Every time I use it I need to ""pump it up"" many times to get through spraying one item (pans are especially bad). Also, to get through one pan the button needs to be depressed many times versus the store-bought can of continuous spray. I realize it's got no aerosol to depend on but it should still work better. I'll need to use it a while long before I decide to continue using it or to go back to the store-bought cans."
4,Love These,"They worked. I bought two, one for Canola Oil and one for Olive Oil. They do make a very fine mist which does fly around in the air but all aerosols from the supermarket do anyway. Very pleased and they look great on the counter."
1,Not well made,"The sprayer is great at first but they don't hold up well. They clog up, stop spraying then eventually break, the pump breaks or the plastic and metal case separate."
3,A Little Too Misto,"The Misto does a good job of turning oil into mist - too good. It spreads a nice even coating of oil on the food but also fills the air with the oil mist, a mist that will eventually settle on kitchen or dining room surfaces. In other words, is the convenience of using the Misto worth the eventual oily mess you'll have to clean-up?"
3,Misto does what it says...,For some reason my husband seemed to think he needed a spray mister for his oil instead of dribbling it on. The Misto definitely does that job. Me...I'm not convinced yet that it's necessary.
3,BPA free? Want proof.,What plastics are used in the Misto?Where does the company say it is BPA free?
1,Beware of aerosolized oil,"I am a pulmonary specialist (lung disease). I am concerned about aerosolized oil from this product or any other (Pam). Inhaled oil can lead to lipoid pneumonia, a difficult to treat respiratory ailment. Enough said."
3,Misto Olive Oil Sprayer,"We haven't had this for long, but it seems to work ok. Unfortunately, it came with now instructions on how it works. It took a fair amount of trial and error to get in working."
3,helpful with problems,"The Misto sprayer is quite helpful in spraying your pans and keeping you cholesterol down because it allows you use any oil you want. Yet the sprayer is wrought with one problem, the spray doesn't last too long. Before you know it, you are squirting oil instead of spraying. While I do not expect the spray to last forever, I do expect the spray to last a minute or two. This one lasts only a few second no matter how much you pump the bottle.Enjoy"
2,"Works well when it works, doesn't work too often","This is a touchy little gadget which I've retired to the back of the cabinet and will likely freecycle in 2009. If it is used daily, it can work fine, but if it is not used for even a week, I have found that the spray simply doesn't work. When I first used the Olive Oil Sprayer and it stopped working, I called the company and received instructions to get it pumping. Unfortunately, I found that the time it takes to clean out the system and get it operational is better spent doing other things, so I simply use an alternative to spraying the oil. I really wanted to use this can all the time, but it became a nuisance. I do have a little sprayer which does work great and was sold in a martini set. I suspect it's because there is no oil messing up the system."
3,"Good Idea, Questionable Durability","The idea of being able to spray olive oil on fish or a dry pan is a good one, but after serious use, my mistos start to leak and sputter to the point where they just haven't been worth the effort. I now prefer using a bbq brush or other method of getting my olive oil where it needs to go."
1,A Great Concept that Fails in Execution,"I had a similar experience to most of the other reviewers. I had great hopes of this product -- expected to enjoy low fat cookery without the mass-produced flavor of most commercial cooking sprays. I had visions of chicken enlivened with pecan oil; salmon fired up with hot sesame oil; fresh tomato pasta sauce with just a hint of extra, extra virgin olive oil. Well you get the picture.However, I was doomed to disappointment. I filled it the first time with best-quality olive oil. The first spray worked just fine. And the second. But come to use it the third time and the plastic ""guts"" were broken -- irretrievably. A costly kitchen gizmo obliterated by a 5-cent part.I'd love to see this product relaunched with interior workings to match its exterior. Until then, guess I'll just have to keep using Pam and dreaming of something better.Sigh..."
1,Misto Gourmet oilive oil sprayer,I bought this sprayer as a Christmas present and the person used it only 2 times and the white screw cap inside that holds the spray mechanism in place broke. It seems that this is a faulty part of the sprayer. I would like to know if I could get a replacement part for it. I was very disapointed in this product due to it breaking.
5,Misto IS BPA-Free!,"Hi everyone! I'm Tony and I work for Lifetime Brands, the company that manufactures Misto. I've read many of your reviews and wanted to let you know a few things: First of all, Misto is BPA-free. Regarding performance, remember to only fill your Misto half-way to leave room to pressurize when pumping. Also, you CAN use Misto with many types of oils, including: olive oil, vegetable oil and canola oil to name a few. You can also put vinegar in your Misto - which is perfect for salads! Thank you to everyone for the great recommendations for Misto!"
4,THE FINAL OIL SPRAYER,"tHIS PRODUCT IS THE VERY BEST i HAVE FOUND SO FAR IN THE LINE OF OIL SPRAYERS. HOWEVER, ONE MUST LOOSEN THE COLLAR AFTER FINISHED USING IT SO IT DOESN'T CLOG. AFTER LOOSENING THE COLLAR TO RELEASE PRESSURE THERE IS SOME OIL FILM WHICH SEEPS DOWN THE OUTSIDE OF THE UNIT. BUT I DO RECOMMEND IT."
2,Too much work for the results,"I have tried to reduce the amount of fat added to our cooking. The Misto seemed to be a good way to put only a light coating on, and it does do that. However, the amount of pumping of the sprayer it takes to pressurize is overkill. I'm looking now for a simple spraybottle instead."
1,THE MISTO NOT SO MISTRO,"I PURCHASED THIS GADGET, AND IT REEKS. IF I PUMPED IT TOO MUCH, I'LL JUST GET A SQUIRT. IF I PUMP IT TOO LITTLE NOTHING HAPPENS. I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS GADGET!"
5,Oil sprayer,"Bought three (3) of these for The Christ Mas as gifts. Have had no feedback yet. However, I owned one (1) for 15 years in San Diego and gave them as gifts there. They were soon appreciated as a neccessary kitchen and bar-bee-que devise. Highly recommended for every kitchen. I fill with evoo (Extra Virgin Olive Oil) and is very handy for a quick ""spritz"" of items in a pan, from the oven broiled or baked, or from the nuke (microwave). Sometimes the quick ""spritz"" saves food from being too dry! Special good purpose for items being turned (salmon fillets or steaks, shrimp and waterchestnuts wrapped in bacon, even ""nuked"" veggies) Try one! Recommended. I would/will buy more."
5,throw away that spray can,i use a lot of olive oil and this was perfect. i ordered one for my son. he does healthy cooking demos and this was perfect for his take a long chefs kit. delivery was one time. satisfied customer
4,"First one broke after a few years, this one works great - so far","We use this sprayer for olive oil and it works great. Yes, you do have to pump it up quite a bit and occasionally you should clean it out with hot soapy water - but still a great product. Tried a cheaper unit from Target and it was junk."
4,Misto sprayer,"I am happy with this sprayer, but found a less expensive one that works even better. I gave this 4 stars because I think they are a bit over-priced. The Trudeau sprays even better at a much lower cost. I have only had them a couple of weeks, so I will update this post if one out-preforms the other over time. So far the Trudeau has a better over all spay action."
2,"Didn't work very well, then it broke","I was excited to use this product instead of having to buy non-stick aerosol sprays, but when I used it, the spray was very blotchy, not uniform, and kind of weak. After about 5 times of using it, the white screw-on collar broke in half for some reason. The worst part is my roommate grabbed it the bottom half dropped off and spilled oil all over the hardwood floor and carpet!"
2,I Guess I needed to learn the Tricks,"I really wanted to like this product. I bought it thinking I was going to love it. And I did, for a while.My problem is that you can only fill it half full of oil so it felt like I was constantly filling it with oil after very little use. In addition to that after you spray oil on your pan for a short amount of time, you have to stop and repump it to that it will continue to spray a fine mist. Also it quickly got clogged and as one reviewer has stated, once it is clogged; it's goodbye Misto. I used mine probably less than a year before we finally went back to buying already canned spray oils.I guess I should have read the reviews because it sounds like if you know the tricks and take the time to do the work such as loosening the top, you will be able to use this item for a long time.good luck to other purchasers."
3,it's an option to Pam sprays,the spray is not as fine as I would like. I have to pump it frequently. makes me wonder if i could get the same results with a small dollar spray bottle....which i will try. I use it but not overly impressed.
2,Clogged after a few uses,This is great in theory but it clogged up after a few uses and didn't produce an even spray. Not really worth the money.
1,Great Concept... but mine doesn't work,"I received this right on time but was disappointed after the first day. It's far less substantial than the description made it out to be. The pressure works great - for about two seconds. In order to spray a pan of garlic bread, I have to stop after each piece and pump the canister back up. It doesn't spray very well, but it spits gobs of oil quite nicely. I filled it to the halfway point - and no more - and pumped as instructed.I'll experiment with it later to see if I can get it to work properly. Meanwhile, I can't claim to be a happy user."
5,works great,Our's is several years old and still works great. We don't fill it up all the way per what the reviews recommend.
5,Does the job,"I've used two Misto Misters for a few months (one for garlic infused olive oil and one for white balsamic vinegar).They have never clogged and consistently mist.HOWEVER, I use each almost every day. Perhaps the reviewers who complained of clogging use their products less regularly or with thicker solutions?Suggested Uses: Spray olive oil/ and or vinegar over salad for flavor. The spray evenly distributes flavor without making greens soggy. Also, as it is nicely distributed, you can have the same flavor with less oil or vinegar.Fill with canola oil for an environmentally friendly non-stick spray."
4,Great alternative to disposable spray cans,"After reading about additional chemicals put into disposable cans I decided to pick this up. Works very well, I use just pure olive oil, and the can uses air pulled in through the pump to push it out. No chemicals or additives for me!"
4,Great product,"I really like this product, only 4 stars because you have to pump it for every 5 seconds of spray, but hey, that helps not put too much on right? Oh yeah, and watch out because the mist will rise and cover items in the area."
4,Misty might be a better product name,"The Misto really does spray olive oil out pretty evenly, but it doesn't come out like a typical spray bottle does. It's very misty, even more so than a cologne or perfume bottle. That's not necessarily a bad thing, it's just not what I expected.For me, it only means I have to spray a little bit longer. Aside from that, the Misto is very cool and a lot better than sloshing your bottle all over the pan."
4,Works good once you get used to it,"I've been using this for a few months now and I am happy with the purchase. I use it mainly for coating a pan or grilling and I feel its saved me much more than its cost in olive oil. There seems to be a sweet spot for how many pumps you should do depending on how full the container is to get the longest spray time before it starts coming out in a stream. Once you get used to that, it works wonderful."
4,suck on it,"If the sprayer stops spraying properly, pull it out and suck on the bottom of the tube while you push the button on top.Mine clogged....then a small stream, many times...not much problem now... except as some reviews have pointed out the fog that is very obviously visible in sunlight... but oddly i find no greasy(i use extra virgin olive oil)places like one would expect, since i use it only for air popped popcorn...oh yes the top plastic on the popper thing needs more attention than normal.Actually i wish it would go back to that tiny stream.The fog makes it lose one star.Bought in May 2010... and still like new.Presto 04820 PopLite Hot Air Popper, White"
2,"Should be called ""sputtero""","Maybe I was overly optimistic, but I kind of expected a product named Misto to produce something resembling a mist. Once in a while it does produce a mist, but not very often. Most of the time it puts out a sputtery spray of large droplets. Filled it only halfway, pumped it up good, it just doesn't work well.On the other hand, a Sputtero is still a somewhat useful device. It's a little easier to oil up foods for the grill with a Sputtero than with a paper towel or (ick) rubbing it on with your hands."
3,"Works well, but I broke it after only three months",Works as advertised and worth the high rating from Cooks Illustrated. The pump mechanism broke after three months. I can not find replacement parts and Misto did not return my email asking for a replacement. If you experience is like mine you'll enjoy the mister but the pump will wear out long before burly stainless steel body wears down.
4,Works just fine,"Okay, you get a little arm workout when pumping this thing, but once the resistance is there, it sprays oil out like a charm. It really does the job when you need a light mist of olive oil on vegetables, or need to spray coat a pan for baking. Now I feel like there is just enough oil there, instead of my old method of using too much by putting things in a plastic bag w/oil & shaking it around, or dipping a paper towel in oil and smearing it over a pan to coat (kind of a waste). This item is pretty economical for what it does, it's attractive, and it works. If you do need to do multiple sprays the pumped air can run out pretty quickly, but that's a small thing. 4 stars for the little sprayer (5, minus 1 for the workout)."
5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,"I own a Misto, and have been using it for some time. It works wonderfully, and I have not had any problems with it at all. It produces a good even pure oil spray, and it saves money. I used to use ""olive oil cooking sprays"", however those products are expensive, and most are not pure oil. Oils have boiling points and flashpoints, and the use of impure oil makes cooking like rolling dice. if you're serious about cooking, use the real deal."
5,works as advertised,Just got Misto and the thing actually works. It's very straightforward to use. The spray isn't as fine as with a can of Pam but I feel better not polluting the Earth with dozens of empty steel cans. The spray is good for everyday purposes. It's well made and even looks elegant with the stainless steel appearance so I can leave it on my countertop with my spices. It does take a little bit of work to pump air into the canister to get the pressure but it's small price to pay for a reusable canister. I put regular vegetable oil in it and used it for frying eggs. I plan to use it for a non-fried baked chicken recipe. Normally I drizzle oil on breaded chicken and bake it. I expect it will be better with Misto because I won't have to use as much oil. Great product. Wish I had discovered this years ago. Arrived in perfect condition.
1,I should have known better,"Ordered this several years ago and it stopped working a few months after I bought it. Saw it recently on a cooking program and thought ""Well, maybe they've fixed what was wrong it."" Ordered it again and scrupulously cleaned it at the recommended 6 week interval. After cleaning and refill it sprayed very weakly. Now a couple of weeks lately it's not spraying at all and there's no movement in the sprayer. I wasted my money."
5,Handy gadget,"Ideal for small household, gives you choice of oil to spray, no mess, easy to handle, I even spray a lite coat on my Pupcorn.Claus"
2,Vegetable Oil Sprayer,I was disappointed in the sprayer. It does not easily cover the small pan I use without consistent pushing. It could be my fault since I washed it before using it and the sprayer might have had some water in it. It is attractive. The service was very good. The mailing was very fast.
1,Works great at first... BUT,"I've gone through 2 of these now. I decided to try a second one after reading reviews from people providing a couple of tips, including releasing the pressure after every use. Nothing helps. It works amazing at first, but over time (just after a month in both of my experiences) other problems begin, including clogging or the seal not being able to hold pressure anymore. Pieces of junk. It's too bad, I wanted to believe! I can't find any information on getting in touch with the company either."
1,really!,"They were junk from the word ""go"". Unpacked them from a two-pack, and that took about 10 minutes. Then it took about another 10+ minutes to get the glue off (they were glued inside the pack). Just as I got the glue off the first, I opened the container and looked inside. The smell was a strong plastic smell that has to affect the olive oil taste. BPA free? Don't know, because the packaging does not mention that. After reading the other reviews, I am passing on this item and returning it.Misto Gourmet Olive Oil Sprayer, Brushed Aluminum"
1,Stream not mist from Misto : (,Worked OK for awhile - now only a brief nanosecond of spray and then a stream and then nothing at all. After repumping the same sequence again. Also the oil leaks from somewhere. Very disappointed
5,Brilliantly Designed Product,"This is a brilliantly designed product for the following reasons:1) It looks beautiful with the aluminum.2) It sprays effectively.3) It cleverly pumps when the user puts the cap back onto it. Maybe I'm an idiot and every other similar device on the market does this, but someone put some thought into this function and said, ""Why have two actions - one to put cap on and one to add pressure to sprayer? Why not have one action do both?"" That's brilliant design.I have two. One for olive oil and one for apple cider vinegar, both for BBQ'ing. You won't regret it."
5,so great!,"I waited so long to get one of these, but when I did, I couldn't imagine living without it! No aerosol, no additives, just pure oil getting sprayed on! You can spray it on salads, bread, and a whole host of other goodies! It doesn't take up much room in the cupboard, and once it is there, you will never regret it!"
3,This is just okay,"It looks nice and functions decently, but nothing to get overexcited about. The spray is sometimes erratic no matter what you do. Part of it may be that I like a little more oil than I'm willing to admit, too. I am not sure I'd buy again, but like it enough to still use it!"
4,Misto olive oil mister,"Fast delivery. Works great. Easy to use and I think every kitchen should have one. However, it arrived with a chip when it was supposedly new."
5,Great tool,"This is a great tool and replaces the need to get another aerosol can at the grocery store. Haven't really calculated whether it saves money, but it seems to taste better when sprayed on veggies and such for the grill."
1,not the same,Purchased a Misto before and liked it so much I wanted to get anotherbut this is not the same. Sprayer top comes apart instead of beingone piece and what comes out is so fine it creates a cloud of oilthat floats and coats everything in the kitchen with a layer of oilinstead of coating the food or pan that it is intended for.
5,"Works Great, you can use any oil you choose","Finally - I can buy organic olive oil on sale and refill a mister with it whenever I run out. I'm an avid cook, and I've really enjoyed using these. I bought a set of 2 at costco and I have olive oil in one and canola in the other."
1,Very Disappointed,"I purchased 3 Misto Oil Sprayers, two for gifts. The one I kept for myself does not work at all. I read several reviews and was looking forward to a good product. It does not build up pressure when pumped. I have soaked in warm soapy water and reassembled it multiple times hoping to get it to spray. It is half full of olive oil, I have pumped it many times without ever feeling it was building pressure. I called the manufacture but could only leave a message and have not as yet gotten a response. Very disappointed!"
3,A bit disappointing,"I had high hopes for this item as I wholly embraced the cooking spray introduction. I also am not really thrilled about propellant usage. However, it just does not work as well as I hoped.I followed the directions and filled with the proper amount and type of oil. Then I pumped. Afraid to break it (I've busted a bike tire pump)I was careful not to go too far. This barely covered a single cookie pan. I pumped it again, but due to the underspray, I had as much oil on my hands as I did the pan. I did finish the pan with this exertion however.This was not a single occurance. Both my daughter and my boyfriend have used it with similar results. Maybe I have a faulty one, or overly high standards. Mind you prior to this, I had been re-using one of the (I can't believe it's not butter's) pump sprays quite nicely, so I don't think so.They need to do a better job in design in my opinion."
3,Works great - until it eventually fails,"I loved this thing. So much so, that I ended up buying it several more times for my friends as a gift.I filled it with olive oil and put a couple of cloves of garlic inside. With every pannini I made, I gave it a couple of pumps and easily sprayed garlic-infused oil on the bread for a crisp and flavorful pannini. Excellent.Also for a salad - a couple of sprays is enough to give all the ingedients some essence of a garlic-infused olive oil dressing, without the amount of calories you'd get by simply pouring dressing on it. Great for a diet.Problem though - it failed after about 4 months. Just started leaking and the nozzle stopped spraying a mist, but rather a drippy stream.At least it's cheap enough to keep buying a new one."
1,Great idea but unreliable. Must be a better one somewhere,"I thought this a wonderful idea after ruining several pans using the aerosol sprays that leave a sticky residue. I bought two - one for olive oil, another for vegetable oil for coating bake pans. After about a month the veggie oil began squirting rather than spraying. No matter how hard I pumped, could not make it spray. Emptied it, thoroughly cleaned in hot soapy water. Then it worked...for about a day. Back to squirting.The one with the olive oil still sprays but unevenly and creates a mist in the air like air freshener. Maybe that's why they call it ""Misto""."
3,It was great at first...,"I was really looking forward to receiving my Misto sprayer. It worked great for a little while. But when I went to try it today, it wouldn't pump. The white collar was cracked and I had used it normally, it was never dropped. After reading a few reviews, I noticed I wasn't the only one having this problem. I just wish I could find my little instruction book that came with it so I could also get a replacement cap for mine. I do not wish to purchase another when all I need is the cap so mine will work as it's advertised to do. ... .... ....Update: Wrote to the company a few years ago, and they sent me a replacement cap. The company was very helpful and friendly. They said the company that made the caps for them had used an inferior material, and they had to recall all the old caps. The new cap has been working great ever since. :)"
4,Mine works well,"I have had might for almost two years now. I have not had the problem with parts falling off and the unit not working. I have found mine to be reliable and to work very well. One thing I did find was a maintence issue. At times the mister becomes gummy with oil. So you need to take everything apart soak in hot water and remove some of the buildup. Other than this, I find this to work very well. I give this a 4 for having to take the mister a part and having to clean it out."
2,Disappointing Mess,"I rarely use my Misto because it doesn't work.I've pumped it till there was enough pressure and it just shoots out short squirts instead of a steady spray. My friend's Misto works better but is very messy, expect to get oil all over your hands. The bottom line is that even if you get one that works, it's a mediocre product."
3,Just ok,Was hoping for a great purchase... didn't get that. It's just ok. Seems messy and doesn't really work as I hoped it would.
2,"Eventually, the spray nozzle dies","It's a great idea for a product. We put olive oil in ours and used it to coat pans before cooking, or glaze fish and poultry. However, the the spray nozzle failed after about a year of light use - now a weak spray comes out in a single stream.I have tried finding a website or some way to return it for replacement, but there doesn't appear to be a way to do this (please comment if you know)."
1,"Great at first, then useless!","It worked well for two or three weeks, then---no matter how carefully we cleaned it---it only sputtered pitifully."
2,No Luck After Buying Ttwo,I have had two of these. Neither one worked very well. More sputtered then sprayed & clogged easily. One person was nice enough to point out all the tricks to keep these things working- but really- they should just do what they are meant to do- without alot of fuss. I am looking for something made better........
1,Didn't even last a month !!,Don't waste your money! It worked great for about 2 weeks then the sprayer cracked. Apparently this is very common. A friend told me the same thing happened to her as well.
5,Misto oil sprayer,Just what I was looking for. Follow the the instructions and it works perfectly. I know this has cut down on the amount of oil I use for cooking and on pasta and in salads.
1,Junk,"Cheap, flimsy construction with less structural integrity than a tin can. Worse, the interiour has a strange, metallic odour that does not wash out and that you certainly don't want to transfer to anything you intend to eat. It has been years since I have seen a truly high quality mister but this is surely the worst."
2,Didn't like because it aresolizes the spray too much.,"I found this product easy to use, but it aresolizes the spray more than the Pam or other nonstick sprays. I recommend using this underneath an exhaust fan or outside. Breathing the areosolized oil posses a danger. I don't recommend for the use of oil unless you can protect your lungs.. I will use it as a water mister for my plants filling it only with water. Does produce a good mist."
1,Worthless from day 1,"My husband bought this for me after a my old oil mister, which worked flawlessly for YEARS got overfilled and leaked a little. This product did not work from day one. You can pump the dickens out if it, you get 0.3 seconds of mist followed by a steady stream of oil. Yuck. Save your $."
3,It's okay,"You have to pump it up before use and it's kinda messy. It's okay, nothing special. I would recommend coconut oil instead."
2,Yikes....,"this is a bit too much work to get the olive oil out to spray. It does the job it intends to do, just a bit too much effort involved."
2,it's not aluminum and mine has a huge scratch on the cap,"It's not aluminum. When I got it this morning. There was a bit long black mark on the cap. So I have tried to remove it. Since I thought it's aluminum, I use some of magic eraser to erase the black mark.Unfortunately, that wasn't mark but big scratch.Inside of aluminum feel plastic cap is black. so when I use my magic eraser, it shows the inside of cap very clearly. now the cap has smudged black mark on it.I really feel sorry I cannot upload the pictures. I wish the review window have function to upload pictures."
3,Oil Sprayer,"It's fine. Does what it's supposed to do.No, i won't give you 12 more idiotic words on this thing."
1,Do not buy this!,The sprayer doesnt work at all. You can try to push down but nothing will happen. Save yourself the hassle!!
2,"I really wanted to like it, but it's not convenient to use","I really wanted to like this product, especially since I heard PAM wasn't too healthy.I preferred to use my own oil and pump it and use it instead.Unfortunately, this product is really not convenient to use and after a while,it was too much effort for me to use it and the results were less than great,so I went back to PAM (at least until I will find a better product)"
1,Don't waste your money...,"I bought the last week and I received it Yesterday. I opened it today and followed the only instructions that come with the product. And now the Misto won't work, and it feels like it got locked when I push on the sprayer. I've searched for troubleshooting instructions all over the web with no success. I also have searched for the Misto website, but apparently there isn't one. I am very disappointed because I now have to return it back which will cost me money. I almost never post reviews, but this deserved one."
1,Thought it would be better than it is,"I've never had a pump sprayer before, but for some reason I expected that this would work better than it does. It spits droplets instead of a making a mist, and it's such a nuisance to use that mostly it just sits on the shelf looking pretty."
4,Be sure to release the pressure after use,"This is your basic oil sprayer. These things tend to die an early death. This one has lasted a couple of months so far, and is still working well. My wife has been doing two things to keep it alive. Most important is that after every use, she twists it open just enough to release the built-up pressure. The other thing she does is clean the nozzle with hot water every so often to prevent it from clogging with oil. Whether the Misto brand sprayer is better than any other oil sprayer I can't say, but so far so good."
1,Poor material,"I received one of them severely damaged and the second one's body were smashed during normal use. I do not recommend, the body is made of a very thin aluminium. It will easily damage."
3,Loose plunger,"This sprayer would have been terrific except the pump plunger repeated fell out the sprayer cap. Since the plastic of the plunger is glue-phobic, I used ""MR GRIP"" perforated aluminum strips to secure a tight firm cap grip on the plunger. All is now well in the land of green non-toxic sprayers."
3,Another temporary solution...,"This product was a decent performer for about a year. I cleaned it each time after refilling it and only occasionally had problems with the oil streaming, but generally never had a problem with clogging. When the sprayer finally stopped working I noticed the plastic pump section on the cap that inserts into the spray mechanism had started to separate at the bottom. I tried epoxying the broken section together, but this did not seem to fix the problem with the unit not pressurizing.I have looked online for other products but most of them seem to use the same pump mechanism so I suspect they will have the same problem after year as well."
1,"Two Mistos, Same Problem","I purchased a Misto and--like many other reviewers--it worked great the first five or so times. Then it started spluttering and spitting out a stream of oil, if anything at all, despite the fact that it was practically new. I doubled checked everything: it wasn't too full, I hadn't over-pumped it, etc. Ultimately, it seemed like some kind of gasket in the interior pump mechanism had busted, as it was partially full of oil.Later, I found another model on sale for a few dollars and I decided to give it another try. Mine was probably just faulty, right? WRONG! Within three uses, the same old routine started again. I won't be investing in one of these wastes of time and money again."
1,Unreliable and untrustworthy construction,"Was fun while it lasted, but mine broke within a week - the spray button is stuck in the down position. Frustrating and disappointing.When you look over all the reviews on this item it's evident that a substantial number of these units have quality problems of one kind or another. Even a considerable number of the positive reviews mention having to jump through hoops to get the thing to work correctly.Which is a pity, because the product is a great idea, just executed poorly and cheaply. I would gladly pay more for a quality oil mister that simply and reliably does what it is supposed to do. But the Misto, at least the one I received, is a piece of junk whose execution doesn't live up to the promise of its concept."
2,Kinda does the job,"I ordered this off of Amazon and it came in a day before the estimated date.That was great to expect.But this Misto sprayer doesn't really ""mist""it just sprays and splats the stuff outit doesn't even cover the area that is being sprayed very well either - cuz when I used to cook with, my eggs got stuck to the pan...and I had to pump and spray the Misto like 2 full times on a small pan (6in in diameter) and it still didn't do the job...Whatever, it was interesting to try..."
3,"Ok, seems to not work particularly well","When it works right, it is useful, and definitely seems like it helps cut back on the calories for baked veggies, etc. But it also seems to require alot of pumping. I'm sure I could get it to work better, but I don't want to have to ""work"" with something like this, so that's why it only gets 3 stars."
1,Cheap inner parts,"The idea sounds great, but I cannot get it to work. Nothing comes out the spray nozzle as much as I pump. No matter what I do I cannot get the sprayer to move up and down. I tried to pull the spray nozzle up higher, but the head comes off each time."
3,Does the job but nothing fancy,"It's okay. The product is pretty easy to understand how to use. I first cleaned it, then added 3oz of oil and started to pump in order to create pressure as the instructions say to. One problem I had was that the stem which creates the pressure detached from the lid. It continued to do that so I eventually just stopped using the lid. Even after doing 15 pumps (which is what they suggest on the box) the oil still came out a little spattered. It's not a light and fine mist but is a much better option than drizzling oil on food or using a basting brush. I'm happy with the purchase, but will try a different brand of oil sprayer next time."
3,"I like it, but...","So far the item works really well and even before I read some of the reviews I was releasing the pressure after each use. I seemed reasonable. I really wish the inside was coated or had an insert so that the oil wasn't leaching the aluminum, which as most people know, it very bad stuff when absorbed into the body. One of the ""curious"" findings was that Alzheimer's patient's all have abnormally high amounts of aluminum in there system. with cooking or food prep tools the exposure is brief, but oil sitting in there over time? I'm not a fan of the idea. Honestly, I may try to rig an insert of coating myself for peace of mind."
1,"Great Idea, Failed Twice",Love the idea. After a few months the first one only would produce a stream. Bought a second one because I loved how it worked (when it worked) so much. Same problem :(
1,messy,"Seemed like a good deal.And it's great if you like olive oil all over, including yourself.The spray/mist comes out in a very broad cone. So, if you have small or medium sized pans you will get olive oil over everything in the vicinity as well.So, I thought I was smart by just holding the sprayer closer to the pan.The spray comes out with such force that the olive oil reflected off the pan and covered my shirt with olive oil.I think this is a gift you might give to your best enemy"
4,Works well,"Just received this today.I like the stainless steel looks and it seems to be well designed and packaged. Also the spray mist is a lot finer than I expected for olive oil.So, in short, I like it a lot!!!"
5,Perfect,Great for spraying Wildtree butter flavored grapeseed oil on popcorn and then sprinkling with Wildtree white Cheddar Cheese or simply sweet. Healthy too! If you need to try it yourself visit hollyhobby.mywildtree.com for your own wildtree goodies!
4,Works great,Follow the instructions to release the pressure after every use and only fill it haflway and you'll be highly satisfied. It sprays my oil (use olive or hemp oil) evenly and doesn't clog. Highly recommended for the price!
5,"Great kitchen tool helps ""green up"" the kitchen","This sprayer works VERY well, and I feel good about adding another reusable item to my kitchen to replace a disposable product. I highly recommend it for those seeking to ""green up"" their kitchens."
4,Misto Oil Sprayer,"It is a very well constructed oil sprayer. I have been using this for a long time and lost my old one. I just recently bought a replacement for it on Amazon. The oil sprayer serves its purpose. It is easy to clean and the assembly is pretty safe with zero contamination. However one of the quirks is that sometimes the seal tends get a bit loosened up and I will have to open it up a couple of threads and re-tighten it to establish the seal and it is good to go. Also using this kind of a spray than the aerosol oil sprays from departmental stores reduces our carbon footprint. So not only does it serves it purpose and remains green, it also a very good looking item on your kitchen counter top. I will easily recommend this to anyone who is looking for an oil spray"
2,One Major Flaw,"The Misto Sprayer takes about 15 or so pumps to expel oil in a fine mist. Unfortunately, the manufacturer chose to make the screw-on sprayer cap out of cheap plastic (the body and cap are aluminum). The plastic cap cracked after a few uses and now when the sprayer is pumped pressurized air simply leaks out of the crack and the oil dribbles from the sprayer. A major design flaw seriously limits the life of this sprayer."
5,Reviewer comments very helpful,"I can understand why some reviewers found problems with this item - if I may sum up some of the helpful hints:- Hold the pan vertically, so you can hold the sprayer in an upright position- Release any built-up pressure by loosening the cap when you're done using it- Don't overfillWith these tips, I feel this product performs as it's intended, and delivers a great value in being able to use pure oils instead of artificial products. Every healthy kitchen should have one."
1,A Piece Of Junk,"I'm sorry I didn't read any reviews of the Misto Sprayer before I bought one for myself. Even though I followed the directions closely, it never sprayed a mist of oil. The oil came out in little squirts and the oil leaked out of the sprayer making it messy to use. Even if it had worked like it's advertised to work, I probably wouldn't recommend it because the constant pumping you have to do is very frustrating."
2,Works well--if willing to maintain,"I have two Mistos (both gifts). When I am willing to work at keeping them cleaned, then they do work. Thankfully, I've escaped the broken collar problem that so many reviewers complain about.The troubleshooting section of the Misto website...gives instructions about how to get the unit unclogged when it starts sputtering. Takes some time, but soaking in hot water and spraying hot soapy water through the unit does the trick for me. Also read on a web bulletin board that keeping it upright, not tilted, when spraying keeps it from clogging as quickly. But the manufacturer says that it will need to be cleaned and unclogged every 6-8 weeks. So this is a high maintenance item.But when it works, it is a great tool."
3,"great, but","fantastically useful (so much better than the weird aerosol stuff in stores). but yeah, i've been through two--it just starts squirting a stream. you can delay this by not storing it pressurized, but then it's a pain to pump it up each time. maybe, at ten bucks, just think of it as quasi-disposable."
3,Broken collar - but replaced by Misto n/c,"I had written a review (which I don't see here) about how disappointed I was that my mister stopped working after 3 months (of VERY careful handling) because the white screw collar broke so the pump did not have the needed pressure to pump.I had seen others with this problem in reading these reviews. I used the 800# on the instruction booklet and was told by a customer service associate at MISTO that there was a shipment with bad collars and they would happily replace it with another, with NEW design, which should resolve the problem.Within a week my new collar arrived.I suggest anyone with a broken collar who has had it break within the past 6 months might contact MISTO too, and see if a replacement is available.This is a GREAT product when it works :-))))"
2,Not as good as it looks,Mine worked fine for a few weeks. Then started squirting and leaking. Even soapy water cleaning seems temporary. I use it for vegetable oil though. I could live with this but scary is that the oil turns rancid fast. This is due to exposure to air during pumping. Cans use propellants and these vapors are lighter than air. Plus they're almost intert. So they work. Solution: Smell the oil in Misto every couple of weeks. You don't want to feed rancid stuff to your families.
3,fine for a little while,"It works great for a month or two, but then the spray just becomes a thin stream. Still usable, but not quite what you want.Tip: Don't fill it up past 3/4 otherwise it won't be able to presurize right."
4,Another purchase for the wife,"She wanted a mister so i got this one based on reviews. It appears to work fine. you have to pump more often then I would like but hey, it is not a 2gal bug sprayer after all ... it is a little oil mister fr inside the kitchen."
4,Olive Oil spray mister,This item is a great way to save on calories.It works great. Like it alot. I keep it handy nearmy stovetop. Pump it about 10 times and your readyto spray away. Only thing is you have to pump quiteoften as it does not mist for very long. A good productthough in my estimation.
4,not bad,"Delivers a definite mist rather than just a drizzle of oil, but misting action doesn't last long when compared to aerosol sprays. Definitely a better way to apply olive or other cooking oil than an aerosol that has unwanted additives."
4,Saving money and fat grams!,"I bought the Misto because I keep hearing that the propellants in products like Pam are harmful to non-stick cookware. Also, I like to watch my family's calorie intake and budget and this seems like it will allow me to use less olive oil when cooking.So far all of these things are true and I'm glad that I bought the Misto. However, the spray is not uniform like I would expect. It already seems to sputter out a bit, almost as if it is clogged. Overall I am pleased with the product, but I am surprised at how the oil comes out."
1,don't waste your money on this one,"This has got to be one of the worst purchases I ever made. After a few weeks it stopped spraying altogether, and began ""dribbling."" Today, after less than 2 months it totally backed up, resulting in olive oil all over the place."
3,Ok but still prefer PAM!,"Well, I bought this thinking it would be a cool gadget to have and since I buy spray oil often I thought it'd be a cheaper and easier way to get the same thing. Plus it looked pretty in the photo so I gave it a shot. I am overall satisfied with the product, and it is attractive looking. As to be expected, it is not quite as convenient as the store bought spray oils with the propellent. You have to pump it before you use it, and the spray only lasts for a few seconds and needs to be pumped again. It is not an even spray at times and that becomes annoying. I have found that I've been using it in addition to the store bought oil spray. I put olive oil in it so whenever I need olive oil I'll use it, saves on buying a different type of spray oil. Anyways... I guess if you want to cut back on the chemicals in the other stuff, it's a good alternative, but I find I only use it occasionally as a back up."
1,It broke after a dozen uses,"I've had this for over a year. The nozzle became clogged and stopped misting after about a dozen uses. The oil only comes out in a stream now. I've tried cleaning it many times and it doesn't improve the flow. And then recently it started leaking air pressure. I can pump it a lot or a little and it doesn't matter. As soon as I take the cap off, the air starts leaking out from the seal. At the same time I bought mine, I also purchased one for my parents. The Misto doesn't mist either. I wish I could get a refund."
1,It's too much of a pain to use,"When I first purchased a Misto sprayer, it was around $25.00 but even at less than half the price, I still wouldn't buy it again. I absolutely loved it at first but way too much effort in trying to figure out how to keep this thing working! Also, when I hadn't used it in over a month, some sort of mold was growing on the plastic tubing inside, yuck. The mold turned me off for life so now I buy a similiar product in a see through sprayer WITH the olive oil included at Marshalls, TJ Maxx or Home Goods for $4.99."
1,From Instant Joy ... To reality and Disapointment,"I really thought I would love this. I was paying an outrageous amount to buy olive oil in spray can's from the store and thought this would be a really great way to apply only a limited amount, but not pay the cost (per oz) that comes with the spray can.Unfortunately, it doesn't spray well. At first there is too much pressure and it's just a stream, then it becomes a mist like spray (what I wanted) but it only last a second before it becomes too low a pressure and it starts a very jerky uneven spray.After only a short period of use, I suddenly realized I had used almost a whole bottle of olive oil already. I was paying less than the spray can, but I was consuming more than 10 times the amount of oil I thought I was using. Needless to say, I have the added weight gain to show for it.Also, with normal regular use, there ends up being oil all over the canister, the table, and a lot of other surfaces around the general spray area of my food prep area."
1,Too bad that you can not rate this a zero,"I'll be quick; it leaks like you would not believe!What a great idea, but cheap components make it worthless. Ours leaked within a few weeks and the retailor refused to take it back. Save yourself some time and frustration and just throw a $20 bill in your trash - it's quicker and less harmful to our environment. Or better yet, keep the $20 in your pocket and pass on this all together."
3,Functionality great... but the cap?,"Functionality on this is great - easy to use, creates a very fine spray. Does exactly what it claims to do.The body of the sprayer is indeed brushed aluminum, but for some reason the cap didn't match quite right. There was a chip showing black plastic, and the brushing was not at quite the same angle. Doesn't affect the end use, it just makes it look a little cheap."
2,Worked Great - Broke Quickly,"I had a Pampered Chef oil sprayer for a few years and needed a replacement so I bought this. I knew about releasing the pressure when not in use, etc. My PC one lasted a long time but wasn't great at spraying. I got the Misto and it worked great, for 3 months, and then the plastic ring that creates the suction for pumping up the pressure cracked and split. No pressure, no oil spray. So much for that $10."
1,Cheap - broke on first pump,I would strongly suggest that you avoid this product. I used it just once and it promptly broke on the first pump I attempted.
2,"Great concept, poor execution!","This is one of those irresistible ideas. Who wouldn't want to use their favorite oils in controlled amounts? I purchased this sprayer with great anticipation, and expecting performance. What a disappointment it turned out to be. The sprayer is a dribbler. I initially thought it was just a defective unit, and returned to Amazon, receiving the replacement in only a few days. The replacement worked for the first day, and on the second day it failed. If the manufacturer can fix the issue, I will definitely try again. Amazon informed me that if they make the item available again it will be because the issue has been fixed. I will keep an eye on the site, just in case. I would like for this product to deliver consistently the performance that I had during the first day."
4,A Green Product that pays for itself,"I love making Bruschetta and Pannini but was tired of the mess of brushing olive oil on the bread. An aerosol spray can of olive oil cooking spray works great, but I worry about the additives. (And the taste isn't the best.) The Misto has been my solution. I know exactly what I'm spraying and it works great. For the cost of a couple of cans of cooking spray, you have a sprayer that you can refill and use over and over again. And no more empty aerosol cans being sent to the landfill.To get a really fine mist, you have to pump the top until the built-up pressure doesn't allow you to pump any more. Then, after use, twist the top to open it a crack and release the pressure. This prevents clogging, which can be a messy problem.NOTE ABOUT AMAZON PRIME SHIPPING: I've been very impressed with Amazon Prime. I ordered this product at 5 PM on a Friday, and I received it by noon the next day. Practically instantaneous gratification."
4,Olive Oil mister,"This is very handy, but after you pumping, it only sprays for a short amount of time and then you have to pump it again. I wish the spray could last for longer before having to pump again!"
2,Right idea....,"but bad quality. We really wanted to stop paying for the spray cans at the store and just poor cooking oil from our bulk purchases. But after 2 tries, the Misto just didn't last long and was unreliable."
2,Did not last very long,"This worked great, while it worked! Would get a fine mist of oil, but just a few months into use, and the mist has been replaced with sort of like a oil spray. I guess the nozzle stopped working properly."
1,Should have paid attention to the negative reviews,"This was to have been a nice gift for my husband. It was a disappointment instead. I read many reviews, deciding that if one simply followed directions, it would work. Unfortunately, the naysayers were correct. It was not worth the mone; it does not work! Not sure how to return something that has been used."
4,Good product,"Love the misto. I ordered three 2 packs. One was defective in one of the 2 packs. I gifted the others over the holidays so I'm not sure. Even so, I was quickly refunded and love using this product"
3,Just okay,Not as thrilled with these as I thought I would be. I will continue to use them though as I purchased a nice Caphalon pan and they say not to use canned cooking spray on the surface.
3,"Not exciting, not bad","Never again purchase a can of PAM (at least in theory)! As a means of making salt adhere to air-popped popcorn it's OK. I've never used it to apply oil-and-vinegar salad dressing - I prefer vinegarette with herbs, dried mustard, salt, sugar, paprika, etc. Misto won't get that job done without massive clogging, something that happens naturally enough. As a device for adding a little lube to a grill or skillet? Misto works great. Do release the pressure between uses to keep nozzle from clogging (so often), as recommended by other reviewers. But it's not nearly so difficult to unclog as some reviewers would have you believe. Just pump hot water through it."
3,Misto olive oil sprayer,"I like the product; this is my second. They don't have a long life, the plastic parts break. But it works and I haven't found a better alternative. It would be nice if there was a way to get parts. They're cheap but it still bothers me to throw away the aluminum or stainless cannister because a cheap plastic piece can't be replaced."
2,Don't know what the problem is,"Recently received this as a gift. When I initially cleaned it with water, I followed cleaning directions and got a nice mist of water, then when I filled it half-way with grapeseed oil it didn't work at all.I will follow one of the other posts that suggest rinsing in hot water. If this does not work I will try to return it! I cannot believe I didn't even get a single good use from it.It is a great idea though, if it only worked."
3,Healthy but clogs easily,"This surely makes dishes healthier, as you can spray the olive oil on the food/pan instead of pouring globs on, but even with cleaning and proper use the spout starts to clog up. It could just be my humid environment though."
1,Not what I expected,I really liked the idea but hated the product. It leaks and its hard to spray enough oil for regular cooking. Wonder if I was doing something wrong.....
3,Not much of a mist,"I had high hopes for this gadget, and now that I've used it a few times, I am disappointed. You really have to pump until the can seems like it will burst before you have enough pressure to actually get a mist. Usually that mist goes away before I can even spray a pan, and I am left with a little stream of oil instead. I am also afraid to over pump because others have mentioned that a plastic piece inside will break and cause this to stop working. Also, the Misto makes such a mess, and no matter how much I clean the container, my hands get greasy whenever I use it."
3,Handy little thing to use.,"I ordered the red Misto sprayer and received the silver sprayer. I was surprised about that, but not bothered enough to return it.Before use, I would strongly recommend following the instructions on washing and cleaning this sprayer out. It has a plastic-ky, factory smell that you definitely wouldn't want to rub off on your olive oil. I repeated all the wash steps twice and let it dry out for a day before I filled it up with olive oil.It creates a nice fine mist, which works well for coating baking dishes, spraying on veggie chips before baking, on bread before toasting, essentially anything that you don't want to rub olive oil on.I'm a little concerned about some oil leaking out of the nozzle and accumulating near the cap, and hence 3 stars. I will update on if this is a real problem."
4,"simple to use, easy to store",makes spraying oil onto pans much easier than pouring olive oil into pan. healthier than pam spray and can use a variety of oils.
4,Great Item,"I love my Misto. I've been looking for a while for a product that would let me spray olive oil so I would stop wasting so much while cooking. This has been perfect. The one that I found at the local health food store was nice, but it was three times the price that I ended up paying for the Misto. It does spay some more ""chunky"" mist once in a while, but no mare than other cooking sprays. It was also very useful for spraying olive oil on the wall after my 2 year old colored on the wall with crayon. Very happy I bought my Misto. :-)"
4,Works great when you follow directions,This is my second misto. The first one I over filled and it failed. This one I have filled no more than half as directed and it works great.
3,Bought 2 - one clogged up,"Bought 2 since I cook in my kitchen and the boyfriend's. The one at the boyfriend's house is used more often and has clogged up. I no longer get a ""mist"" it's more of a stream. The one at my house is rarely used and still produces a mist. I would still buy again. Much cheaper than constantly buying Pam."
4,teaches sensitivity to cultural differences,"The authors seek to educate the American reader in a certain amount of cultural sensitivity. You are assumed to be a social worker (or something of similar ilk), with clients or patients drawn from a typical American population. Nowadays, there are substantial minorities. With backgrounds in Latin America, Asia, or they might be from the Negro community.The different backgrounds can lead to difficulties between you and the client. The latter might have language barriers, and so be unfamiliar with your questions or theraputic advice. Plus, various standard diagnoses might have been derived from tests or experiments on white populations, and sometimes white male.En route, the book explains why the DSM 4 handbook is a big improvement over DSM 3. Version 4 has more inclusive guidelines on cultural differences. Makes you more aware of potential problems."
1,not exactly music,"This is not exactly music--more like whining with some instrumentation in the background. A major letdown compared to her album, ""Wondering."" I will throw this one away."
3,ONE GOOD ONE BAD,"MYSTERIES OF THE WORLD IS AN EXCELLENT CD FROM BEGINNING TO END.ORCHESTRA CD IS A HACKNEYED DISCO DISK THAT FALLS FLAT. THE PRICE HOWEVER IS MORE THAN WORTH IT JUST TO GET""MYSTERIES""!"
3,The younger the better,A family is struggling and a dog with no family of his own. The story is great for 7 and under and my older kids watched it but wasn't to entertained. If your looking for somthing to keep the kiddos busy while you wrap this will work just fine.
3,For older kids,"The book has beautiful pictures and poems, but tends to be a little much for younger children. Maybe better for kids older than 6 years."
3,Theeditingwaspitiful,"I like Chester Himes stories and writing but in this book, ""All Shot Up"" the editing, or lack of editing, was extreme. I'm pretty sure the ""intent"" in the ambulance was really and ""intern"" and I suspect when the bullet went through the man's hat it ""nailed"" it to his head and didn't ""hailed"" it do is hear. It was like that all the way through wishsomewholeparagraphswritten withnospacesbetweenwords. I still like Chester Himes' books. The editing in this one was horrible."
2,Did Not Finish This Book,"The author of this book is not George Pelecanos. I found I was not interested in any of the many characters. The setting was certainly sordid, but not in an interesting way. I was just a few dots into the book (sorry, but I was reading it on my old Kindle) when I decided to give up and look for something better."
3,You wake up...,"You don't know who you are. You don't know where you are. You just wake up one morning, sleeping next to a weird guy who thinks his name is Dart. But his name tag says Wade. Welcome to the Strangerhood. An internet parody of television shows using Sims 2. Lost, CSI, American Idol, all are targets of this wild ride of an internet show. Including music videos and commentary. The only problem is that, while there is some humor, the lack of a plot, which is part of the plot, means that after watching it you don't feel like you've gained something. Like eating a four course meal and feeling hungry.True the characters are funny but soon become kind of boring. Maybe because they are, also, parodies. Walking and talking jokes.Get it used. Otherwise you may wish to pass it by."
2,"Very, very suckish!!!","Well... it starts intresting with people who don't know each other and suddenly wake up in the same neighborhood without remembering how they got there, but then it got to fictional, stupid, and not very funny. Being used, it didn't work in my laptop or in any of the good dvd players I have, only worked in the cheap one. As a huge Sims 2 fan it was very, very dissapointing!"
1,"Unbeatable deal, uncooperative company ...","I purchased this fan through Unbeatable Deals and was dissatisfied with it. I was looking for something with a little more power. When I contacted them I discovered I was only a few miles from their return center.I inquired if I could drop off the item at their return center and got a curt and flat know. They stated that they needed a paper trail (their own invoice and a letter from myself not being good enough).I am physically disabled and do not drive. The cost of transportation, cost for shipping, and other related costs would come to more than half the cost of the item to send this back.I'm very dissatisfied with this company and the product which I took to be a more power fan (about the same as my honeywell which I paid about half the price for).Buyer beware on this one."
4,The best of the affordable ELO collections,"I've searched long and hard to find the best ELO collection - and this is it. First and foremost is the sound quality. If all you've heard are the US versions of ELO on CD, you're going to like this! While bonus ""bonus"" CDs often contain throwaway tracks and over-extended remixes, this one adds EIGHT more classic tracks. The only flaw is that it's missing ""Xanadu"" though it contains ""All Over the World"" from the same soundtrack.Still, with that minor flaw, if you want an affordable and solid ELO collection, this is it."
5,Great Poker Essentails and fast delivery,"The information contained within Mr. Fromm's disc is unbelievable. I was surprised that he revealed this kind of information. It helped me with my game, and gave me a new point of view to look at Hold 'em from the short handed angle. On top of this, Mike Minkoff shipped this disc insanely fast.thanks,Phil"
4,good video,This is a good video for someone who has already been playing poker for a while but is new to short handed game. Not a bunch of fluff like you get in a lot of books and videos that are out on the market.I have the heads up videos that were put out by the expert holdem team. Based off of the 2 video's I have seen from expert holdem I would pull the trigger on anything they put out. Good logical video. And they explain reasoning behind the instruction.good stuff.
5,Good car wash soap,Great car wash soap from Meguiar's. Thick and produces good suds. It's been a while since I've used something else in order to compare. One bottle lasted a couple years of washing two cars multiple times a year.
2,OK car soap,"For $7 bucks I can't complain much, but am.Pros:Does an OK sorta of good jobCons:1. Doesn't maintain suds nor soapiness. I start at the front, work around the passenger side, rear end, then the drivers side. By the time I got to the rear, the suds had diminished and the soapiness of the water long gone calling for a refill. Mind you, 1/3 cup of soap to two gallons of water one should expect more, right?2. Has a perfume odor. I want my cars cleaned not smelling like some imitation gaga flower.3. Same cleanliness and sudsiness[sp] as Meguiar's Next Generation [lavender/purple color]. Big hype; name and color change does not equate to quality.4. Same cleanliness and sudsiness as my local auto store generic brand at $4. Sorry Meguiar's you lose, BIG time.Will not buy again."
4,Excellent but bottle is not recyclable,"I agree with all the positive reviews on the performance and quality of this wash, but the plastic is a number 5 and where I live has to go to the landfill."
5,worth the money.,"great stuff!!! do not think twice about it ,BUY IT!!! good amount of suds ,smooth finish after drying truck off."
5,Good quality soap,"This soap seems to have more suds than other car shampoos and it cleans better than the cheaper car shampoos at the auto parts stores, i definitely recommend it over any other auto shampoo out there."
3,NOT ONE OF THE BEST COMPILATION CD,"THIS IS NOT ONE OF THE BEST COMPILATION CD, THIS SHOULD BE A ALASKA Y DINARAMA DE COLECION.....EMI LATIN INCLUDED IN THIS COMPILATION 4 SONGS THAT BELONGS TO ALASKA Y LOS PEGAMOIDES.1.BAILANDO2.EL PLAN 3.LA REBELION DE LOS ELECTRODOMESTICOS 4.HORROR EN EL HIPERMERCADOTHEY FORGOT TO INCLUDE 1.DESCONGELATE 2.

2,Quite poor - Cainz's Review was right on the money,"I should have read these reviews earlier. I was so disappointed by this CD, I was anxious to warn people about it - only to find Review Cainz to have experienced exactly what I did. Telarc should be ashamed of themselved - simply taking their ""Surround CD Sampler"" and putting a DTS label on it. In fact, it appears that DTS themselves do not have any quality control on the use of their name.It's a fine CD sampler for general surround sound - but there is hardly any difference at all between their generic surround sound CD (I bought both at the same time). But anyone that has experience true DTS mixed CD's (i.e. Toy Matinee).If your goal is to show off DTS - pass this one up."
2,You get what you pay for,"At 32 pages you really do get what you pay for. Minimal info on only common herbs, precious little indoor growing information, and certainly nothing that you can't find easily on the web."
2,Confusing and frustrating,"My kids and I have tried 2 recipes from this book and the measurements of the ingredients seem way off. The bread recipe was so dry that I had to add almost one cup of additional liquid. The pictures are very cute and fun for kids to look at, but confusing when looking for details of the recipes."
1,Ugh,"If this is improved sound, I'd hate to hear the prior recordings. Compared with a typical modern recording, it's like hearing something that was recorded from outside a concert hall through the walls. And to me the performances aren't much better; it's hard to believe these 2 Beethoven masterpieces could be made boring, but Toscanini achieves it here.With excellent modern recordings of the 9th (Gunter Wand's on RCA is my favorite) and the Missa Solemnis (Gardiner, Klemperer, and a terrific DVD conducted by Gielen) available, why anybody would waste their time listening to these recordings is beyond me."
2,price has always been too high,"The price of this RAM has always been high while most RAM goes down in price. Because you have to buy in pairs the cost is not worth it. For the price of a pair of this product, you could be half the way towards buying a new computer with much more memory."
3,Echoing same freshness,"3 1/2Even if they were beginning to borrow from themselves, one of metal's most melodic musicians make massively moving material."
2,cookie cutter rock,"I don't know what all the fuss is about. Pelican sounds like half a dozen other bands that play this type of music. Not much happening here, very little melody or experimentation. Some tracks sound like 'sludge metal', if that's what the band is aiming for, it sounds like cookie cutter rock to me. Maybe the band has done a more exciting album than 'City Of Echoes' but this one isn't it. 8 tracks/42.35, cheapo digipack."
3,Hardcore Industrial Dance,"These are not my kind of thing, however if you are looking for four 70+ minutes of hard techno, this set is for you! Some of the synthesizer is unique with a hard industrial tech beat all the way!"
1,Dona Barbara,Dona BarbaraUnable to review. DVD was spolied for the second time and I had to return it.
5,Awesome!,"Great Book and CD combo! Has tracks minus the drums that you can play along to, Jaime Abersold style. All the beats and variations are great!"
4,Fantastic Ride,"Excellent for any comic book fan, student of history, or anyone just looking for a great story. What a wonderful way to introduce people to one of the most pivotal battles in history -- or for old antiquity salts to celebrate a familiar story in a new way!Our heroes (anti-heroes?) are the Spartans, the most militaristic and brutal of the ancient Greek city-states. The Spartans are presented unapologetically: murderous, violent, savage, loyal, honorable, obsessed, skilled, and pure masculine power. This graphic novel has truly brought a lost time, lost people, and immeasurably important historical event to life."
5,You Have to Know What You're Getting Into,I've read reviews in here of people complaining that the graphic novel isn't representative of the movie. Of course not! The graphic novel came first! Anyone intersted in Frank Miller artwork would love adding this to their collection.
4,Great concept on a legendary battle,"What can I say, it's Frank Miller's epic opus. I believe every other review has covered the nuances of this graphic novel. I actually read it late in the game, having vaguely heard of it before but not actually laying hands on the book until after the movie came out. Both the movie and the book prompted me to revisit the historical accounts of the Spartans' valiant struggle against overwhelming odds. For some reason, Thermopylae reminds me of JFK - I believe he quoted the famous epitaph in one of his speeches. If 300 inspires young and old to read up on history because of the valor of its protagonists, it will have served its purpose."
4,Very well done,The detail and concept are quite interesting.Generates alot of discussion when used as a coffee table book.
4,Very much like the movie,I got this book and intended to read it before i saw the movie... i ended up seeing the movie first with my girlfriend (she cried at the end... so i guess it WAS a good date movie. i dunno) ... anyways... the movie was awesome... and the book was VERY close to the movie... but of course they added stuff to the movie to make it longer... otherwise the phrases and everything were exact. i loved the book... but loved the movie even more. Frank Miller is a genius. I hope you find this lil review helpful.
2,Herodotus meets Sin City and gets whacked.,"I was hoping that Miller would turn his talents from the dark side and we would see how well he could reproduce a Classical Epic. What we get is a blood splattered ""300 Lacedaimons in the Hood"". The Spartans are presented to be a buch of Homo erotic Rastafarians. The Persians rather than the Noble Middle Eastern Autocrats presented in their Art are drawn by Miller to resemble African American Gangstas with piercings and Skin art everywhere. I was looking for Xerxes to have a grill and whitewalls on his chariot.If you were into ""Sin City"", you will love this mishmashed version of the Classical Tale of bravery and sacrifice in the face of overwhelming odds."
2,300 Review,"Expected the book to be more interesting. The narrative part is very poor, the drawings have also let me down."
1,What's the point?,"After reading this luke-warm dramatization, one wonders why Frank Miller chose to leave any resemblance of history at all in this tale. Obviously, we're limited in our knowledge of this era, but Miller's laughable inventions add nothing, but only are xenophobic, homophobic, and, worst of all, dreadfully boring."
1,Disapointed,"I had heard so many good things about the upcoming movie, (It is out now) that I wanted to read the book prior to seeing it. I had a horrible misunderstanding as to what I was buying. I thought it was going to be a novel, but instead it was a Comic book. I quickly returned it without reading it. If you are into comics perhaps it is for you, as for me I prefer novels."
2,Comic books dont do it for me,"Upon reciept of the book I was immediatly dissapointed to have found what appeared to be more of a comic book than an actual book about this legendary story. With an average of about 10-15 words per page I did not find it a satisfying read. Also it seems they tried to use direct quotes from the movie, but often forgot key parts, such as when King Leonitus meets his ally in the mountains, he asks him why he brought so few soldiers; in the movie. In the book they leave out the word soldiers which is the key point Leonidus is making, saying he has brought more soldiers than he, but they include every single person that he asks their profession, the sculpter, potter, blacksmith etc. Flipping through though, I did find that it held a vast assorment of drawings from the artist, some quite detailed and gory which I believe makes up for a completely poor book, so I give it a 2 out of 5 stars."
4,pretty good miller work...,"300 was ok. it wasn't mind-blowing, the format was weird, and the story goes by very quickly. the book is about 90-95% set-up, then the battle all of a sudden is over. i would have preferred a sin city length work on this subject by miller. but it's still pretty good."
3,Eye candy without distraction of a meaningful plot,"The product was as expected. Nice artwork and many panels with interesting soundbites. The snippets about King Leonides' childhood were my favorites. The characterization of Xerses as more of an African rather than an Asian did not work for me. A reasonable build-up to the big fight which, is all this graphic novel is about. No other story lines or plot developments. The old movie ""300 Spartans"", although hokey by today's standards, did try to convey more of the Greek life and Sparta's relations with other city states. Since Miller's 300 did not take 2 hours to read, I am hoping the movie will provide some more nourishment."
5,better than the movie,"if you're a fan of Frank Miller, Graphic Novels, or Great Storytelling, then you must have this book."
4,Bloody but worth it.,"I got this graphic novel in preparation for the movie coming out this year. It's exiting to finally see something on the ancient Spartans, an amazing group of people in history. Though the graphic novel is not totally consistent with what we know about the battle the artist has kept the feeling of who these people were and what they accomplished. As with any picture book focusing on battle it's going to be bloody, but it's unique and I'm glad I bought it."
4,Buy It,"If you are a comic book fan and enjoy Frank Miller's work, you will want to pick this book up. The art is very good and the story does not even begin to get boring. After you are done reading the book you will want to go back and read it again and again. It is a wonderful story of bravado, belief, and self sacrifice. It is a great piece of work to add to your comic/graphic novel collection. Shell out the $ and get yourself a copy."
5,Wonderful version of a great Greek heroic tale,"I purchased this book because I read that it was going to be filmed,starring a favourite actor of mine - Gerard Butler - as King Leonidas.I have seen the movie version of Frank Miller's other illustrated book 'Sin City' and it was excellently done.I realise that this is a very different type of story but I am optimistic that '300' will also be awesome as a film.I bought the hardcover book and I think it is wonderfull!It brings this great story to life and the illustrations are out of this world.Looking forward now to seeing it come to life on the big screen and I think Gerard will be wonderful. He has an incredible range as an actor,transforming himself for each role.I am waiting now with interest to see who is cast as Xerxes.I read in one article that Sienna Miller was to play the Spartan Queen,Gorgo,but hasnt been confirmed?"
1,RIPOFF,"A truly awesome telling of this story is ""Gates of Fire, an epic novel of the Battle of thermopylae"", by Steven Pressfield. A truly awesome book, and the original which was ripped off by Hollywood insider Frank Miller."
4,Typical F. Miller,"If you like Miller, you will like this. It was shorter than I thought it would be, but it delivered in true Miller fashion. If you are looking for a historical accont of the battle, move along, this is a big fish account of the legend with enough fact sprinkled into it to stay true to the myth."
5,300 Stars,"I was fascinated by this book the first time I saw it years ago in the Virgin Megastore in Times Square.It's a very interesting story. It seems to be based loosely on real events, but with a very Frank Miller twist. You can tell he likes these guys as they show up in other works of his. Hell, this story features prominently in Dwights story in Sin City.Overall a must read for any Frank Miller fan and anyone who is looking forward to the movie, which opens tonight!"
2,A poor substitute,"While beautifully drawn and arguably one of Miller's best works, this book is a prime example of surface over substance. The retellling here of the battle of Thermopylae simply does not do justice to one of history's greatest stories. If you really want to know these warriors--their loves, their fears, their training; if you really want to experience the battle so clearly that dust mixed with day old blood chokes your nostrils; if you want to understand the camraderie and leadership that puts the life of the man who's protected by your shield above your own, read the definitive work on the subject: GATES OF FIRE by Steven Pressfield."
4,Lust for war .,"A fantasized interpretation of the battle of Thermopylae from Mr.Frank Miller (sin city) The theme of , when you go down you go down fighting , is still here , so are the Greeks and Persians , but the facts are altered a little . I didn't know the persians employed basketball players as emperors.It's still an enjoyable graphic novel . Showing what we, the man tribe, do best , fighting one another . And not forgetting the coffee table size of the book that adds to the macho tendencies it offers ."
5,Outstanding Graphic Novel,"yes, this Graphic Novel inspired the movie 300. Which, I might add, is one of my all time favorite sword and sandal movies. But the graphic novel itself is a work of art. The tone of the novel was captured well in the movie. The illustrations are great and the story is top notch. Recommend!"
4,Bloody Well Done...,"300 is similar to Sin City in tone, violence, and characters. If you liked Sin City or enjoy Frank Miller's other work, this does not disappoint.The book is a relatively quick read, but the artwork will have you stuck viewing page-a-day. At $20, its an inexpensive way to boost your art, comic & literature collections."
5,Beautiful and Moving Story,"If you are thinking of checking out the movie - or if you already have, you have to read the book! The images are so powerful and wonderfully illustrated, and Frank Miller's writing is amazing. the story is not dialogue driven, but what is there is perfect. Highly recommended!"
3,a must have,"a must have for 300 fans, definitely alot cheaper than Barnes&noble or borders. i was a little disappointed because one of the corners was a little bent from bouncing around in the box, and the pages didn't sit straight on the book when u looked at it sideways, as if humidity had gotten to it, or something, but aside from that it was a good buy."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"A retelling of the battle of Thermopylae. Miller is taking the style that it appears he now works in, a la Sin City, and applied it to this historical recreation. No detailed wedding tackle for those hoping for such.A story of the uncompromising military attitude (and xenophobia, of course) that leads to a last stand."
5,A Frank Miller Masterpiece now the Motion Picture,"From comic book legend & creator of ""Sin City"" comes this spectacular tale of glory, of the battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C. as King Leonidas, bold ruler of Sparta, leads an army of 300 warriors against the Persian army of of King Xerxes. It's a thrilling, heroic & enthralling triumph, great comic book art & storytelling, a historical masterpiece from the legendary Frank Miller, this an excellent read for anyone who reads comics or is goin' to see the movie."
2,unexpected,we wanted the book that the movie 300 was based on. this said it was that book. when we got it it was a comic type book. very disappointed with that.
1,Not a good book,"I have a feeling that 300 does not really show things the way that they took place, but I'm willing to look past that, in search of a good story. But this story is just ludicrous - it stacks all the goodness in the world on one side, and then invites us to cheer for the Spartans who represent all the forces of light. The Spartans are manly and defenders of freedom. The Persians are barbarians, easily crushed in battle, and quite inexplicably, Xerxes seems rather, well... I don't even want to start on that.I don't know how a society that survived on the labor of helots can repeatedly be proclaimed to be the champions of freedom they are made out to be, or what good so much freedom is, if the society has to kill all these children just because they are not good soldier-material."
3,"Great artwork, immature story","I bought this book because I'm a huge fan of Miller's artwork and style. If you're the same, you'll enjoy the cinematic feel and visceral battles that are influencing the upcoming feature film of the same title. Unfortunately the story's interpretation is far too masculine and juvenile like a 14 year old boy wrote it, much like other books Miller has done. Way too much macho crap. I understand they're soldiers and this is a war book but how tough spartans are doesn't need to be constantly reinforced. I got it the first time. So this made the characters flat to me. I didn't care about anyone. Xerxes turned into the hero by wiping these jerks out.For me, story is paramount and art comes second. If you're a 14 year old male, you'll think 300 is awesome. Otherwise, so-so.jon"
1,Wrong type of book,"For the first time since I've been ordering from Amazon, I had to returnan item. When I read the description of the book ""300"" I thought that it was a regular hard back book. I had no idea that it was a hard back comic book. I was disappointed but you took my return with no problem. Thats for that."
1,Comic book?,I didn't realize I was ordering a comic book. Next time I place an order I will be more careful!
1,"Not As Described, Returning ASAP","The Spectra Premium NSP01A oil pan is not a viable OEM replacement part. The advert claims that this item is powder-coated; however, it is just treated with enamel. The oil drain plug supplied on the pan is not the Nissan specified (M12-1.50) oil drain plug. The NSP01A comes with a much larger, non-Nissan specified, (M14-1.50) drain plug. I did not bother to install this pan as it is not within the specifications of the original Nissan oil pan. I am promptly returning this for a Dorman 264-500 oil pan, which satisfies Nissan specifications, and going to do this job correct the first time around.Dorman 264-500 Oil Pan"
4,The Teacher's Grammar of English,"Since this book is both a Course Book for teachers and a Reference Guide, the first 60 pages are useless for most experienced teachers. However, there are still 600+ more pages discussing the major grammar structures that most grammar and writing teachers will need to know. I like the way the author provides in depth explanations and short summaries of each grammar structure. The author also provides occasional information about L2 interference broken down by various language backgrounds. There is also a section at the end of each chapter suggesting ways to teach the particular grammar structure. I wish this section was more developed. My only other complaint so far is that the author only devotes one short chapter to verb tenses!"
5,Simply excellent,"MÃ©xico Profundo is a must-read for anyone attempting to understand the complexities and contradictions found throughout Latin American in general, and within Mexican culture, specifically. The book is written in a clear, direct and eloquent manner that gets to the core of present-day Mexico's predicament."
5,Awesome!,I am very pleased with what I purchased the book was still in the wrap!! Thank you so much it even got here like 5 days before !
5,Southern small town struggles,"I loved this book. It is well written and reminds me of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" both in quality and style. This was a book that I did not want to finish and I fell in love with the characters. The descriptions of life in a small town in the late 1940's resonated with me and her characterizations of people were dead on. There was enough mystery to satisfy my love of that genre but it was so evocative in it's painting of ""the south"" and it's struggle with the racial issues that I was hooked from the beginning. Because I live in Canada, it was a treat to bury myself in this totally different world. I could almost smell the magnolia's and feel the heat.I especially enjoyed her ability to get into the mind of an 11 year old and to see the world through her eyes. Rang true all the way through the book. Ms Sprinkle has written a winner and I look forward to reading more of her books."
4,"Definitely with a ""woman's touch""","Loved this book...however I found it difficult to keep up with all of the characters. I, too, first checked it out from the public library and then purchased it to pass on to others. I would definitely read other books by this author."
3,Material Unit Rate of Carbon Steel Pipe,"Material Unit Rate of Carbon Steel Pipe from Diameter 2"" until 32"""
1,BATTERY PACK NOT INCLUDED,"No Battery PACK?!?!?!?! This toys does not include a $30 battery pack That is required to play with this toy... If you can even find the battery pack. Save your money, don't buy this toy!"
1,Caution: DO NOT BUY ALONE,"Grandma purchased this online for my son and just read an ad for it in todays paper and noticed that in small print it said she needed to buy a battery pack separately (an additional $29-$49)to make it work (She didn't see the same notice online). We've been doing research all morning to find the correct one, because there's opposing stories on which one we need. What a pain this toy has proven to be and we don't even have it yet!!!! Save your money and go get a toy that COMES WITH all the pieces to make the thing work!!!"
4,snoop dog is cool,the terrain twister is cool but it isnt fast when it goes forward and it wont go on the roads or driveways
4,$30 for one battery still cheaper,"To all those 'reviewers' that wrote negative comments about the $30 TMH battery that runs this thing....WHEN IS THE LAST TIME YOU PRICED BATTERIES? About $6 gets you a pack of 8AA batteries which is same power as one battery pack, AND THIS MAY LAST ABOUT AN HOUR. So in one week, you could blow MORE than $30 on batteries going IN THE TRASH! I agree, its not clearly stated that you need to purchase it, but dont complain that rechahrgeable batteries cost too much. But a Nikko car for $20 and see how much your kids can make you spend on 9V and AA batteries!! By the way, the car is cool too!! ;-)"
1,How about making a few more,I guess the marketing guys for this company will get some bonuses this year and the manufacturing side will all get fired. what's with a toy that's advertised everywhere but can't be had anywhere? Maybe they should make enough to meet half the demand...and package it with the necessary batteries.
2,waste of money,"My son was dying for this toy last Christmas. It took forever to get the special flex battery from toys rus, and then it didn't work very well at all. It looks like it will go through any terrain on the tv commercial, but it hardly even went, on anything that he tried. He was very disappointed, and has hardly used it. Overall, a waste of money."
3,ok toy but hard to use,I got this toy for my son the controls are very hard to use. it is not that good on land. it is ok on water. the controls are hard to use it takes away the fun. the top of the toy is not sealed so if it gets splashed or if it tips over water will get in.
1,"I wouldn't know, Toys R Us doesn't provide accurate info.","It would seem that Toys R Us doesn't do a good job of listing battery types required for toys. In fact, at Walmart.com they are selling this item for $80.00 and it includes the battery and charger. I ordered this toy from Toysrus.com and based on the information I found at the site I was led to believe that this toy took the standard re-chargeable Tyco battery pack + 9V battery. So I ordered the battery pack that I was led to believe I needed. Everything arrived and on Christmas my son opened it. To my suprise, in fact the battery pack ordered was not the correct one. So as of now all I can say is the toy looks really cool. I will let you know how it works when I get the necessary battery pack from Wal-mart or K-B Toys. So if you are looking for a RC toy might I suggest you go elsewhere. You may find out that you get more for your money else where and that you get more accurate information."
3,YOU NEED A BATTERY FOR THIS THING!,ATTENTION!:THIS TOY NEEDS A BATTERY THAT ACTUALLY COSTS 30$!CALLED A FLEXPAK (WHATEVER THAT IS)INSTEAD OF A 50$ TOY IT IS ACTUALLY 80$
1,expensive and hard to control,With the required $30 batter pack this thing is nearly 100 bucks! And it doesn't go well on hard surfaces like concrete or asphalt AND it doesn't work well on 2 to 3 inch high grass. So it's great if you happen to have sand nearby. Anyway it's a pain in the neck and doesn't work too well especially for the price. Oh and it's really hard to make it go in a straight line.
5,Terrian Twister coolest toy ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This can go through SNOW!WATER!MUD!AND GRASS!!The first tycorc that goes in SNOW!!!!!!This toy has drillers that go through everything!If u do not buy this toy u just dont like toys.I would recomand this toy to buy,because i have it and its cool!!!!I would rate this toy a6 star."
2,Fun but broke too easily!,"We bought this last Christmas when it was new, harder to get and more expensive. It is a great idea and we had fun with it for about six months. When we went back to play with it a couple months later it was broken. We had even read and followed all the directions. The warranty was no longer good and since we paid so much we took the time to take it all apart and repair it. It had a crack in the plastic motor housing and water got in and rusted some of the leads. It was nice to have it working again, but the next time we went to play with it there was another part that wasn't working."
2,Buy with caution...,"My two boys ages 7 and 5, have played with this toy a total of two times since last Christmas (almost a year.) It takes a long time to charge up, and the charge doesn't last long. Also, the necessary battery costs $25.00 (Whoa!) I would say, for the price of this toy, it should be more fun."
2,"be aware, may not be a replacement part","I recently purchased a tyco rc rewinder and my son lost the transmitor. the problem is tyco does not have a transmitor for me to purchase, now i am out $100 and my son can not play with his birthday present. If you purchase any of the tyco(mattel) remote control cars, make sure you can purchase replacements if needed or your purchase is worthless."
1,VERY DISSAPOINTED POP-POP Ha Ha not Ho Ho!!!!,"I purchased the TWISTED TERRAIN because of the way it was advertised on this site.I thought I was getting a great early Christmas present for grandson.It goes great sideways but forward & reverse Ha Ha!! I tried it in the sand,grass,& on carpet.NO LUCK!! It's a little cold to try on water!! Now I have to pay double shipping to return it. I think it's defected it's that BAD!!! I think amazon,toys-r-us & especially TYCO should be ashamed of selling & manufacturing such a piece of thrash!! CAVEETTE EMPTOR BUYER B WARE ""STAY AWAY"" SHAME!! SHAME!! SHAME!!!"
1,DISAPPOINTED!!,"Another DISAPPOINTED kid at Christmas! THANKS Tyco, nice job! Yes, Tyco put a small message at the bottom that the battery PACK was not included. But give me a break, we all know and assume that batteries usually aren't included. I didn't know I had to buy this $35.00 practically one-of-a-kind battery pack. Like I'm REALLY going to use this thing in ANYTHING else BUT that one stupid toy! And you can't find them anywhere in town! What a lousy way to grub an extra buck! Well, Tyco will probably lose plenty of customers over this one!"
1,Piece of Crap,"I bought two, a 27 mhz and a 49 mhz for my two sons. One failed to work at all right out of the box. It would not turn on. The battery worked in the other car however, so I know it wasn't the problem.The other car (49 mhz) worked for about five to seven minutes before completely locking up. I powered it down and back up several times and tried the other battery with a full charge (since that car wouldn't even run) to no avail.I rated this vehicle straight ones, mainly because there were not any lower values. The price of two Tyco Terrain Twisters - $200.00. Two battery packs - $40.00. Having both cars let us down Christmas morning - let's just go with MINUS FIVE STARS."
4,New Blades Always Handy,"This is a great mini-utility knife. It folds, locks, and feels good in use. It has a ruberized handle of some sort that has stood up well for over a year. One of the best features really is the blade storage in the handles, this means no matter where you are with this little cutter you should have a new blade ready to pop in. You can also score the old one and place it in the handle until you have time to properly dispose of it."
3,micro size and micro blades - very limited cutting depth,"I was surprised to see how very small not only the knife is but how small the blades are as well. The usual mini blades are half the size of standard utility knife blades and the blades that work with this Sheffield are half the size of the mini blades. The blade has an effective cutting depth of only 1/4"".It is too small and has no clip for carrying outside of a pocket and in some ways too thick to carry around inside a pocket. It is 3x the thickness of my Swiss Army pen knives. The extra thickness is needed for the storage compartment for the spare blades.The knife will lock in the open position but it will not lock in the closed position. I could see it opening before it is fully out of a pocket if it catches on the fabric.Not a bad folding utility knife for the price but not something I would recommend either."
5,Mindblowing.,"One of the most powerful, gripping and downright funny British films to come out since Withnail and I. It's biting social satire and classic English grit make this well worth the couple 'a bob you'll spend. It seriously blew the roof off the Scouse.. I mean, house."
4,A Solid Book,"This book is a very thorough analysis of the role of the Holy Spirit throughout the entire Bible. One of the most interesting chapters is the role of the Holy Spirit in the Old Testament. I found it very enlightening. This book is not for new Christians or beginner theologians, but more for theologians at the intermediate level. Sometimes it is hard to read because the sentence structure is interrupted by Biblical references in the middle of a sentence. Bible references should be footnoted at the end of the chapter. I recommend a person be very well versed in the Old Testament before buying this book."
5,What the Bible Says About the Holy Spirit,"This book is very informative, unbiased and totally ""on the mark"" as to being Scriptural. It is ""reader-friendly"" and as it was recommended to me, I would encourage anyone who seeks the truth to read this book."
5,One of Billies Best,"16 Most Requested Songs is one of my favorite album's with such hits as Body & Soul, I'm a Fool to Want You, and God Bless the Child it just doesn't get any better. I discovered Billie Holiday about 6 years ago and have been in love with her music and voice since. I beleive that this album is right up there with ""Billie Holiday Sings Standards."" I think every Billie Holiday fan should own this album."
1,WARNING,"Don't bother looking at this product because it just doesn't work, in reality it made my suv slower than faster. Now I have made alot of upgrades to my suv like a gibson catback exhaust, weapon r cold air intake, a stage 2 performance chip, aem dryflow cone air filter. When the supercharger was installed I didn't notice any horsepower increase or torque, once I removed the so called supercharger put my foot on the gas pedal VA VOOM away I went. Another reason why I removed it because I was getting no power I research the some sites on the web and 99.9% were all negatives no positives. I had originally thought it was the performance chip, I first had a stage 1 mod then right when I had gotten the supercharger I upgraded to a stage 2 mod and I saw no difference until like I said earlier I removed the supercharger and WOW it really moves now. BEWARE remember do yourself a favor don't learn the hard way like I did, or you'll be out a few bucks while the seller is laughing with your money."
1,WTF!,this thing is a joke I bought one just to test. this thing actually made my car lose 18% hp so I decided to install it on my motorcyle with almost the same results. I have read the so called SUCCESS stories and they all link back to the OWNER go figure. DONT BUY THIS PLASTIC PIECE OF JUNK
2,A Royal Snoozer,"Anybody that finds this book interesting has apparently never read much about Diana. I have read just about all the other books written about her, and they beat this one by far. The first 100 pages are about Paul B.'s life, and his service to the Queen. We find out all the small details of the Queen's day, and if you are interested in what she has for breakfast, this is your book. It is almost 100 pages before we get to the Diana part, and frankly I don't know why so much was made of this book. He was (is) so blinded by her that he is pathetic. A waste of time. Basically it is very repetitious, - he tells about fixing her breakfast, lunch, her dinner, blah, blah. He tells what she wore. He was THERE for her !! Frankly, after all I had read about this book I was expecting some new gossip, but there is not even any old gossip. Just too many mundane details about his service, which frankly, made for boring reading. And, he did the unforgivable. He made her boring."
5,FOR PRINCESS DIANA!!!,"This book will break your heart! Mr. Burrell knew her at her worst & best times. His detailed description of her through these periods make you feel as though she was a personal & loving friend to you personally. This made me see her again in a completely different & delightful light. Her treatment by the ""Royals"" at times made me want to scream & cry. The mistreatment of Mr. Burrell by the ""Royals"" after Diana died, was heartwrenching. I feel Diana relied on Mr. Burell as a soul mate that could feel & understand her every mood. Hats off to Mr. Burrell!!! LOVE FOREVER TO PRINCESS DIANA!!! This is a book you will not want to put down...."
2,Pleasant read but nothing new,"Any ardent royal watcher is going to be very disappointed with Mr. Burrell's new book. Not much is revealed in these pages that isn't already known. This book is a love letter from Mr. Burrell to the late Diana, Princess of Wales. There is an implication throughout that he knows more than he tells here, but, he doesn't give many clues about what else he knows. A few details are given about life at Highgrove and Kensington Palace and it makes for a light and not unpleasant read. Just don't expect any great revelations."
2,Not bad!,"I found this book interesting to begin with, Burrellreally harping on his ""special"" relationship with the Princess.Toward the end of the book I was questioning his motives forwriting the book in the light of criminal allegations in whichhe was involved. By the end I was certain he had a hiddenagenda. Not what I expected."
4,An informative read,"After listening to Paul Burrell on RTE Radio and how well he spoke, I downloaded a sample of his book to kindle, needless to say I was totally hooked and love the book, which gave an interesting view of ""inside"" the Royal family, a must read for all Royal followers"
2,Scary! Both of them!,"I read Sally Bedell Smith's bio of Diana and thought that Smith went overboard with her insistence that Diana was mentally ill. That is, until I read Paul Burrell's book! She was impulsive, immature, jealous, vindictive, and full of self-pity. Burrell's story of Diana's attack on Tiggy was a jaw-dropper. How could you idolize anyone who acted like that? This book made me feel sorry for Charles--and I never thought I would. No wonder he turned to Camilla for some intelligent conversation.The sad thing is, this terribly deflating portrait of Diana was written by a man who adored her and thinks we will, too, after reading this book. Our idols really do have feet of clay."
1,not impressed,"I just find it disgarceful to write a tell all book about someone that isn't around to defend thmself and tell their side of the story. Is this book fiction or nonfiction? Who really knows, it is distasteful however."
5,This book has the ring of truth,"I stayed up last night reading ""A Royal Duty"" by Paul Burrell. I couldn't put the book down. Learning about important events in Princess Diana's life is fascinating. Paul Burrell has written a fair, mature and historical book without the gossipy quality alot of Diana books have had. He was completely loyal and complimentary of the Queen and her husband throughout the book, and I can't understand why the Royals would be upset by this book. There were some revelations about Prince Charles' unsavory character traits, but nothing much.I really am enjoying this book and I would like to congratulate Paul for writing a well written, important account of his time with the Princess."
4,Worried about Burrell's mental health......,"This book was an overall interesting read. I enjoyedthe details about life with the royals. But after the firsthalf of the book the story seemed to get bogged down withMr. Burrell's ""obsession"" with Diana. I am surprised that hiswife stayed with him -- it was quite obvious to me that histrue affection was for Diana and he even admits at one pointthat he had ""more respect"" for her than for his wife. It leavesme wondering what would have happened had Diana not been killed."
2,Queer eye for the Princess?,"Had to read it.It didn't reveal anything not yet known.Pauls wife deserves a sainthood for still being with him.Nice finish, left it open for his next money grabbing venture.A couple of things I would like to say to Paul:Look up the word ""Traitor"" (not to be confused with ""Treason"") in the dictionary.Put on your tiara (however you got it), one of your sequined dresses and totter off on your high heels, back to the rock you crawled from under.I'm mad at myself for spending my hard earned money to line your pocket."
4,Truly loving look at Diana,"You can tell that Paul Burrell truly cared for the Princess. Not only does he dispell rumors, he sheds light on the ""true"" Diana. It is a loving portrait of Diana, the Princess of Wales."
2,Disappointing,"This book really sheds no new light on Princess Diana. Instead, it illustrates what a complete nut her butler was! He comes across as emotionally disturbed, whiney and spineless and if even half of what he says in his book is accurate, I'm simply amazed that his family (especially his wife) stands by him. Wow. What a disappointment. I could barely finish the book and now can't wait to get rid of it."
2,disappointing,"I had eagerly anticipated the release of this book and mustadmit that after reading it I was very disappointed. Basedon several pre-publication interviews that I had seen PaulBurrell give, I was expecting the content to reveal new andcontroversial information regarding Diana and the Windsors.This proved not to be the case. Burrell simply took previously known and published information and retold such. His complete devotion to her is obvious but this proves to be a detriment to the reader since his objectivity is impaired. I wanted to geta clearer picture of the real Diana but this wasn't the case.Her unquestionable love for her children and wonderful charity work was written about extensively but her flaws and life difficulties were minimized. I was hoping that a close insiderlike Burrell would have been able to provide the definitive andbalanced portrait we have yet to have on this complex woman buthe didn't quite achieve that."
4,Love and respect,"I suppose that there will always be two camps, pro Diana and anti. This book is about one man's love and respect for Diana, beautiful, capricious and loving as she undoubtedly was, and flawed, as we all are. Reading between the lines of this entertaining and informative book, I cannot but feel that this man was set up by some members of the royal family and abetted by members of her own family, to paint him in the worst light possible, as a thief and a traitor to her memory. I was fascinated by details at life at the VERY top, and by just how fleeting love and loyalty can be when one has to take sides. OK, so she was a bit ratty but with the treatment she got, who can blame her! If you read only one book about her personal life, this would be the one."
4,royally good beach read,"I was surprised by how well written the book is. Burrell strikes a nice tone - intimate but not too smarmy. He doesn't hide his biases, and that's what makes it interesting. Lots of good behind-the-scenes-at-the-palace stuff. Queen Elizabeth comes off very well, which was also something of a surprise. I tend to be a ""skipper"" when I read non-fiction, but I read every line of this. Even the stuff about Burrell's life gets pretty interesting. But naturally, the details about Diana really pretty wonderful. It's a loving tribute to her, and since we're coming up on the 6th (?) anniversary of her death this summer, it seemed appropriate to read."
4,The fish stinks from the head,"Oh Burrell, Burrell. Thou quintessential ...-kissing protector of the British idiocracy. Thou hast coughed up another naughty princess tell-some, but with enough little buttons of ""Oh, MY!"" scattered among its pages to keep those given to such things -- me, for instance -- stuck in that slough of despond for yet another fortnight.It has always amused me that the minions (servant or otherwise), take great pains to laud the queen while lamenting the often boorish, nasty, dull-witted, classist, hilariously smug behavior of her ""staff"" and ""counselors."" Come on, Queenie, you must know by now that you're the CEO of a company full of badgers and wolverines. It seems obvious that the Big Q could stop any behaviour she wanted stopped. But nay -- or neigh -- she simply steps through the muck on her way to her latest public appearance. I daresay she must be blind, deaf or duh!"
1,Si Non E Vero E Bene Trovato !,"Another Kiss-n-Tell about this poor woman, this time from her ever-so-honourable butler ! Her poor sons seeing the Daily Mirror serialise this and dredging up her dysfunctional sex life and the treacherous people that surrounded her, with the author being the latest to betray confidences, and dish the dirt on the dead. Who would want to have their dead mother made to sing and dance in this macabre display of voracious greed which those around her have engaged in since her tragic death ?To her sons she was a living being, to the purveyors of such titillating tomes, she is just a product to be exploited, merchandised, and plasticised.......I feel really, really, sorry for her sons.......to have their mother's reputation traduced for commercial advantage like this."
1,A royal duty,This book did not meet my expections at all. It seems to me the author Paul just like to make money in publishing a book about Princess Diana. Since she is such a famous person.
1,Boring Royal Betrayal,"This is honestly one of the most boring books I have ever read. There is more description about the table settings, tea cups, uniform decorations and silverware that I had to force myself to read, UNTIL I read an insult about Diana, and I then promptly closed the book. Paul Burrell may have been enamored with Diana, but he certainly did her no favor by writing this boring book, and I highly doubt he would have written this book while she was still alive.For someone that was trusted as a dear friend, in this book, Diana's private confidences were severely betrayed. To me, the book lacks integrity, trust, and is quite distasteful. It was simply not necessary. It seemed throughout the book that Paul was quite taken by Diana, and the text shifts from severe infatuation to betrayal. I gave the book one star because it has a few nice photos, other than that, the text is beyond boring and quite the betrayal of a trusted ""friend."""
1,Pure Fantasy,"Poor Paul Burrell. He didnt get a call from the royal family so he wrote a book -- his admission not mine. Then he says the book is not meant to hurt anyone. Regardless of his protests, this book IS a betrayal of Diana's trust. Has anyone heard the interview where he acknowledges that he doesnt HAVE any of these LETTERS? They are all just ""memories"". He isn't the first the write a book like this -- but if you want an inside account -- try Ken Wharfe's Diana, Closely Guarded Secret -- much better and doenst include the fantasy and the worship, while still painting a great picture of a complicated, wonderful person."
5,A story all people can relate to,"Mr. Burrell, while explaining in detail the pomp inherent in royal life, revealed a side of normalcy that anyone can relate to. Initially, I was offended at his revelation of secrets - a Royal Betrayal if you will. However, after coming to understand his relationship with and respect for the Princess and finally, the treatment he received after her death, I was left with the feeling that Princess Di would look down and say ""you tell them Paul - atta boy."" If you can relate to insecurities, friendship, unconditional love from family (such as Princess Di's birth family); jealousy; or a broken heart, you will find yourself identifying with this Royal environment. I wish Mr. Burrell the best success and commend him for revealing his own obsession with his boss. It is touching to hear his story of complete admiration of a woman who was by no means unflawed."
3,Good movies but NOT the original glorious music!,"As much as I like ""The Manxman"" I rate this particular collection 3 stars because it does not have the original music. I first saw it in 1996 on my local PBS station and it had beautiful classical music in it, including ""Serenade for Strings"" by Tchaikovsky and Sarasate's famous ""Zigeunerweisen."" The reason I bought this is because there is a piece of music that is so utterly gorgeous and I wanted to hear it again or at least find out who it was composed by. I can't remember exactly which scene it starts in, I'm pretty sure it's before the baby's born. To this day I still have the tune in my head and do not know where to find it! I was thinking it was by Tchaikovsky since the majority of the pieces in the film were by him, but I can't seem to find the tune in my vast collection of his works. If anyone knows where I can find the original version of ""The Manxman"" with the original score please tell me!"
2,Too Dark for a 4 year old,"DK Readers: Antarctic Adventure, Exploring the Frozen Continent (Level 4: Proficient Readers)Real life Explorers' story of hazards and death. Pictures of frostbitten fingers and toes! A bit much for a 4 year old. Maybe OK for 10 year old. Mostly a history lesson instead of a general info about Antarctica, which is what I wanted."
4,"The definative ""Shining""","I seem to be the only person who really thinks this miniseries is preferable to the awful Jack Nicholson version. This version, however, was written by Stephen King and so felt far more like a Stephen King movie. The child, Danny, doesn't talk to his finger as he did in the old movie (which made him look like he had more problems than just clairvoyance), and although Jack Nicholson is a fine actor, he didn't give the character of Jack Torrence the pathos that Steven Weber did. The hotel chef, Dick, appeared at the end of the original movie only to be killed before he could do anything, making one wonder why he was in the movie at all; in this version, he played his role in seeing the whole horror through. On the whole, this was a good, fun watch. King, as he often does in TV adaptations of his books, has a cameo role that's fun to look for...something like trying to spot Waldo!"
5,"ship hydrostatics and stability , first edition","the best book on this subject-on line with the best of the ""classics"""
4,Tokina AF193 19-35mm on a Canon 350d (Rebel XT),"The Tokina 19-35 is a affordable wide angle lens for the EF lens line. The autofocus works well (including in low light situations). The lines is of decent quality material (I don't think there is any plastic on the lines) and has worked flawlessly so far. I would recommend picking up the lens hood to reduce stray light from entering the lens. If you are looking for a wide angle lens this is very affordable. However, if you have the standard lens that comes with the 350D this lens won't provide a significant difference in terms of a wide shot.Hope this helps!"
5,GREAT LENS FOR THE $,THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST WIDE ANGLE ZOOM LENS ON THE MARKET FOR THE MONEY. I USE IT ON MY CANON DIGITAL REBEL AND IT IS GREAT!
3,NOT AS GOOD AS I'D EXPECTED FOR A CHRISTMAS VIEWING,This so far is the only show I have been disappointed with since I started watching the Avonlea series. I'd expected something better and really christmasy.
2,Why is This Woman Smiling?,"This is not a very happy movie. The acting is subpar and depressing. It has an anti-war undertone that really doesn't fit in with the era this movie takes place in. I'll keep it though just to see some of the old Avonlea cast, but I wouldn't reccommend this one to anybody."
5,AVONLEA CHRISTMAS,EXCELLENT PRODUCTION AND WAS WONDERFUL TO SEE THE MARVELOUS ACTORS IN THEIR AGING YEARSWITH THEIR STILL GREAT TALENT FOR ACTING. THANK YOU FOR SHARING WITH THE PUBLIC THIS DDV.
4,Exactly what we wanted,We were looking for this particular movie in the series and this DVD was it. The service was excellent; it arrived just as advertised and quicker than predicted.
2,Not as good as the series,"I got the video yesterday and watched it. I wasn't happy with it either. The sound was awful! It sounded like it had been copied from a copy.They didn't even mention Sarah. Heck and family memeber goes missing and you don't even call Sarah?I will stick to watching the reruns! I used to tape every episode (for my own use) I would watch them all the time. I found myself bored with the movie, something that never happened before."
3,Happy Christmas a return to old friends for the holidays,"We enjoyed seeing the cast of Avonlea again, although there were so many changes from when we when we cancelled the Disney Channel and stopped getting the series, that some of it was difficult to follow or understand.Still, the show was an excellent entry in the Avonlea saga, and we definately enjoyed it.What I'd really like to see is season sets on DVD, then we can enjoy the entire series again."
2,Not recommended for beginners,"This book has lots of pretty pictures and is good for getting a general overview of the digital audio world. The problem is that the writting is filled with so much jargon that a beginner can get really lost. Some of the terminology needs some more clarification. Because of that, I can only give this 2 stars."
2,Do not buy this book,"If you are an aspiring engineer this book is not for you. This book has no in depth detail into anything. This is basically an answer to the question ""What is digital audio?"""
4,Challenging,"Very challenging game! Expects serious commitment from the player in terms of learning mechanics --after going throught the tutorial and playing three games, I am still unclear on some of the finer points. Great depth and detail... actual historical events affect gameplay. Definitely one of the neatest ways I've seen to make history come alive.I have not experience the crashes another reviewer commented on... there is a downloadable update available from the publisher."
2,Difficult interface and buggy,"Sort of like RISK on steroids, EU tries to do many things in this zone conquest game. Unfortunately, the user interface is unintuitive and clunky. Given the number of things you need to worry about, this makes the game frustrating. It is not turn based, so as you try to figure out how to send those colonists, the computer is running at full throttle. I have also had many crashes and a patch has already been released to let you load a saved game. How can a game be released that can't even load a saved game. This is a quick and dirty port and it shows."
4,head on... innuendo?,"Good movie. It portrays a very troubled soul.He can't fit in, so he chooses to stay alone.The movie gives us a peek into a life that doesn't seem to have a beginning or end. It is just in a state of replay.I do seem to have a problem with how attractive he is despite the fact he doesn't work out and does coke all day long. He should look emaciatedThe supporting character is also very interesting and entertaining."
5,Gay-themed without sensationalism.,"""Head On"" is a film which many will see purely for its graphic content - indeed much of its success is attributed to the Australian public's fascination with seeing Dimitriades naked. Behind the sex, behind the hype, lies an artful examination of the pressures of a greek homosexual existence which marks a beautiful debut for Ana Kokkinos. Ari's beat-sex and inability to commit are rendered with a respect and compassion that could so easily have been replaced with a sensationalist approach. Kokkinos prefers to treat her subject cinematically, rather than in the straight-to-video style so many other gay-themed films are produced. Ultimately the film is a visceral but uniquely touching insight into its protagonist's life which haunts for weeks after viewing. The DVD transfer is high quality. There is little in the way of extras bar trailers from the distributors other recent releases."
1,Disturbing,"I found this movie incredibly depressing. I felt bad for the character regarding his drug use & life choices. The part where he goes in to the alley with the old, dirty, bearded stranger that he eyed in the bar made me gag. I have no issues with homosexuality, I do however have issues about the purpose & plot of this movie. I was left repulsed & wishing I could have the hour & a half of my life back that I spent watching this movie. It was very disturbing."
2,Not very enjoyable,Not something to watch if you're looking for fun or entertainment. It's a dark story about family rejection that takes itself a bit too seriously. A few scenes (especially the police scene) are so over the top that it's difficult to take the film seriously. Skip it.
4,"Great, Real","Great plot, very believe-able, and very Greek! Culture full, likable characters, overall, worth a watch. (Beginning 20 minutes are very slow, until you learn all there is to know about the main character.)"
1,What was this about,All the reviews I read bout this said it was good. I guess I must have mis what everyone else say. For well over half this flick i could not get what this was about. I still don't think I get it. Needless to say the main character Ari was worth looking act and thats the only thing that keep me watching. Sorry folks this one just didn't do it for me
2,Nothing Special.... at all!,"Alex Dimitriades certainly ain't all that. I didn't find his acting particularly competent and (sorry, Alex) he's not that pretty, either. Although the story line was somewhat unique, I didn't find it interesting."
2,a little dissapointing,"I really was looking forward to this dvd, when it arrived I immediately wanted to see it...unfortunately is the quality not that great and even so the sound of this dvd...it looks like as if not a professional taped and recorded it...I am a fan of sassy, I collected over the years almost all her recordings and now I am trying to get dvd's of her. Besides the lack of quality of this dvd its great to hear her, when you get used to the sound quality...Sass sings fantastic!! But be prepared for a dissapointed feeling when you order this dvd."
2,Disapointments,"This DVD,should have been really great, but it isn't. Amateur video and audio makes this a real mess. Even Sarah complains about the lighting..You can not hear the base and drums, only a little piano and the filming leaves out the trio totally. This dark one camera video starts out with very fuzzy audio and the camera has cut off the top of Sarah's head. Very Poor. No more purchases from this producer.Eldon Bryant"
3,Be sure to have someone handy near when 1st used!,"This track was exactly what my nephew described, the cool twists and turns -- I thought I had found the ideal track. Once it was put together (~1 hour and no written directions), it was put to use for the first time and the green car flew off the track. The peg which holds the car is too short and can't keep the cars on. A handy dad can repair and have the track operational. Good luck if you decide to give it a go."
1,GARBAGE!,This is a piece of junk. For starters the track will not stay together. We were constantly putting pieces back together. We'd snap one piece back and on the other side of the layout another piece of track would come apart. When we did get it together it was almost impossible to keep the cars on the track. My son and I attempted to play with this for about an hour and if we made it around the track twice without the cars coming off it was a lot. Like most hot wheels racing sets this one falls far short of expections.
2,Too Heavy for desk,"I don't know anything about what is normal weight for keyboard trays, but I was shocked by how heavy this was. I had a carpenter install it and it lasted about 10 minutes when it collapsed to the floor. You need to have a solid wood desk. Mine is a cheap reproduction (particle board) of wood.It looks like it would be great if your desk can handle the weight.Rebecca"
4,Good enough.,"If you're going to keep a single setting for a long time, this is very good; if you intend to adjust this fairly often, consider one of the more easily adjustable models."
3,Old Style with No Ergo,"I had to buy this knife in a pinch and thought I'd try it. It was disappointing. Didn't fit my hand well. Unually needs two hands to open up. OK blade change, but not the best. If I am able to flick it open, the blade flies out. That's not cool. Going back to my Turbo Knife slide knife."
4,"Nice, light, but a little bulky","I got this knife to replace a similar knife I had. The storage is nice, along with the way the knife feels in your hand ergonomically. The sheer size of it is a bit bigger than what I expected, and the blade changing mechanism is a bit tricky at times.Not bad, not great, but useful."
3,a bit disappointed,"when i ordered this item it was listed as new. but when I received it, it appeared used, with smudges, dings, and fingerprints upon it. however, it was all sealed. a bit bigger and bulkier than expected. but i have been pleased witjh past sheffield knives."
1,Find another reel,Definately not worth the price. Does not stop easily when reeling hose out and does not retract well. Feels flimsy.
4,This music is fun to listen to,"The Hooked On Classics series combines the both of best worlds, classical music and a really nice beat. It doesn't take the place of real classical music and doesn't even try. However, if you want something different, but not like your conventional popular sound, this is it. It is light in mood and upbeat. The orchestration is very genuine and the background beat does not take away from the classical sound. I doubt even those who dislike classical music would find Hooked On Classics disagreeable to listen to. It's great for just listening enjoyment, great exercise music, and highly recommended here."
4,luv them long live Bud & Terence,the two millionaires in Rio and their double duplicates.they knock out all the gangsters together in a duo brawl team.Funny and adventurous from Buddy & Terry ! a must for fans
3,Aguante Argentina!!!,"I have listened to this album many times. I happen to own it as well, but never the less, I don't believe that it deserves any more than 3 stars at its best. Most songs are good, ""Uruguay"" happens to be one of them, and so is ""Valor"". Natalia did a good job picking song writers, but she still has a lot of work to accomplish on her voice. With more work, i can see this girl making it bigger than what she has done so on her looks already. If you are interested in music of the true south american culture, (specially that of Argentina or Uruguay) get cd's by Mercedes Sosa whom will not dissapoint you. Natalia is beautiful, but far from being a good singer or actress."
1,TERRIBLEMENTE MALO,"Los que vivimos en Argentina la padecemos. ES TERRIBLEMENTE MALA CANTANDO Y BAILANDO. Por favor, que se dedique a otra cosa."
5,Great upbeat music,"I happened to come across Natalia's CD at my local library and then coincidentally was watching Muneca Brava and realized they were one and the same person. Wow what a singer! She has charisma and an infectious joy for life that is transmitted in her music and consequently all her listeners. Natalia Oreiro's album is a definite must-have for a light-hearted carefree spirit! By the way, for the first time there's a soap opera that doesn't take itself too seriously and that's what makes Muneca Brava fun."
4,An AMAZING debut!!!,"Natalia Oreiro's first album is one of the best latin CDs I've ever listened to! All the songs here are so nice, better than anyone would expect from a newcomer like Natalia! This album, has really great songs, my personal favourite is ""Vengo Del Mar"" but I do listen to it as a whole album, without skipping tracks! If you like GOOD and tasteful Latin music, then you MUST buy this album!! It's so good, I could hardly believe it's a debut album! After buying this, you should buy Natalia's follow-up ""Tu Veneno"" which is MUCH different from this one, but it showcases better Natalia's talent. But, really, her debut album is a must-have! After buying it, you won't be able to stop listening to it! Way to go, Natalia!!Hope this review helped you!"
4,Graphic SF Reader,"One of the original batch of Marvel graphic novels, and well done. Some of this was of course adapted for the X-Men 2 movie in a somewhat different format. Graphic novels of this type were new and innovative then. A somewhat more adult and tragic look at racism and the tensions and violence between humans and mutants."
5,Kent raises the bar,"With ""Street Hungry,"" Bill Kent raises the bar. His writing style is getting more comfortable with each book, like a worn pair of jeans or a favorite lambswool sweater. His memorable characters border on the surreal, but in a homey, believable sort of way. Like an expert surgeon, Kent dissects the hearts and minds of his characters to let us view the inner workings that make them human. ""Street Money,"" Kent's first Philadelphia based mystery was a joy to read, but with ""Street Hungry,"" his prose reaches new levels of literary merit.Bill Kent--keep the adventures of Andy Cosicki and Shep Ladderback coming."
5,Keep your hands and feet in the car at all times!,"Ron E's hard edged trance takes you on an epic rollercoaster ride. Pure Art. Eclectic sounds and progressions keep interest and attention at its peak. Genre--> Ron E's trance, won't find another artist who produces music with such finesse. If you want words and lyrics go somewhere else because this artist/producer doesn't need them to unlock his Soulgate."
3,Good item.,It was a christmas gift that I bought for my cousins 9 yr old daughter. She enjoyed it and was very interested in it. It was smaller than what I thought but it was still nice. It arrived in perfect condition and in a timely manner.
1,Only a glider and a lot less,"Thsi is a rare goof by Thule. Flat plates that swivle more than 180 degrees around the centre. If you have the two sides flat under the kyak, it will glide but you cant leave them that way because1) they will make a dent in the bottom of the kyak and 2) will not hold the boat in place. If you try to have them tilted inwards to glide and keep the kyak in place, they will not stay the same way as you glide because one will tilt more than the other causing the kyak to drop one side on the cross bar. You will be better off with the saddle type provided it has a smooth sliding surface. In any case you will have to have a set of two in thefront of the saddle type anyway, so might as well have the two sets the same."
2,This cream is nothing to email home about,"It works fine as a moisturizing cream, but it's not particularly ""calming"" to the skin. It's no better than buying any other quality skin cream. My skin still itches."
1,My 3 yo says this burns him,"I have a 3 year old son with severe eczema. Because he tends to itch and scratch, I thought I'd try this cream to relieve his itchiness. Every time I've put it on him, he cries and tells me it burns. (Doesn't matter if he's broken out or not.) I took it to work and gave to a friend to try on her 5 year old daughter, and she reported the same results. So I am surprised to see all the positive reviews given our poor results on 2 unrelated children.In my book, stay away!"
4,"Maybe not a miracle cream, but really great!","I read all the reviews for this cream, and by the end of my reading, I was convinced that this was the miracle cream. That said, with the challenge of keeping your skin hydrated to avoid general ickiness in the winter, this cream really does do a great job. I use it every morning, and I haven't had any more troubles. When my 9 month old nephew visited, we used it on his arms and legs to make sure that we could keep his eczema at bay. What sets this ""creme"" apart from others are the following: it's very thick, so it lasts longer - but it absorbs well and you can get dressed immediately after you put it on; it's unscented (so less irritating to the skin) but it doesn't smell like chemicals (thank goodness!); and it's economical enough that I don't feel bad using it every day."
3,Darker side of Bally K,"I love this series,but this Series 6 has taken a deeper look into life in Bally K. Some new characters showed up with no explanation of their reason to be in town. One of the things I really liked was being able to follow characters through the series. I am sorry to see the demise of Ballykissangel,but I will remember it as an intimate peek into the life of a small Irish town,and it's folks. Wonderful cast members,and totally believable."
4,Old but slill good,"I saw the film many moons ago I liked it then and still enjoy watching it today, for the era it was very well made it's a great pity its's not colour, Jamaica Inn is real and it is in the middle of the moor's I have had many a beer there it is not a hollywood set and the cornish coast is how it is, they had to realy act in those day's to get work and by the way the guy that drove the stage was the only guy the could find that could do this job I knew him well he wore thick horn rimmed glasses and was still blind as a bat,Ibought this dvd some time ago if you don't mind B/W GO FOR IT. Des; from downunder"
1,Non-Numan approved - a total waste of money,"I have no clue where the producers of this audio DVD got their ""masters,"" but it's certainly not a true surround-sound mix of these songs. There is no action in the center or rear channels that doesn't exist in the regular 2-channel stereo tracks that this disc was obviously created from.Sound quality is muddy, packaging is poor, and the track selection has been anthologized on countless other compilations of Gary's post-Beggars material. Please listen to the man himself and don't waste your money on this."
4,A Little Confusing,"I absolutely love this song. The only thing bad about it is that I don't know the words! I guess it just takes time to learn them, and also, I'm not good with rap. If anyone reads this and wants to help me out with the words, that would be fantastic! Anyway, this song is 'da bomb!"
3,"Reduced from four stars for ""noise""","This disc is surprisingly good for the money. This is full orchestra, ballroom tango. The tempos fall with American and International tango competition standards. Of course one could dance Argentine tango to it, but with little variation in rhythm, there wouldn't be much to interpret or to play with. :)There is about eight seconds of silence after the music quits in each track. Most of of these have a hint or more of noise -- a glitch -- near the end of this tail. DJs will need to hit the fade to screen these out. This reduces the value of an otherwise useful disc.Here are the titles and durations for each track:Blue tango, 2:55Choclo, El, 2:12Jalousie, 3:13Cumparsita, La2:36Tango Verano, 1:49Tango in D, 2:15Hernando's Hideaway, 2:32Toreador, El, 2:26Poeta, El, 3:41Santa Monica, 5:03Pasionaria, La, 2:34Guitar tango, 2:03"
1,It's Missing 6 of the 7 Nations,"I realize that, by design, this is a departure from Seven Nations, but it lacks the power and energy of the entire band. The vocals are restrained or weak - not soft. (For example, Diana Krall can be soft without being weak.) So overall, I'm not very impressed and wouldn't purchase it again. But I would purchase more Seven Nations!"
2,cheap,the product didn't work very well seemed very watered down. i have a bulldog and this product didn't come close to the stuff that i get at the vet. spend the extra money on your pet.
3,Game loves to crash on my G4!,The manual is POORLY conceived and written and the only way you gain any proficiency with the game is to play it for a while. The game is also very unstable on my G4 using system 9.2 (I have plenty of RAM so it is not that). It is particularly prone to crashing when it is showing a battle (will easily freeze someime during the battle). It can also become tedious after awhile.This is a shame as I am generally interested in the period and would love to see more games centered around ancient Rome and other ancient civilizations.
1,Cheesy,"Someone should be shot for making this game. Prime example of a good idea gone awry. Graphics are pathetic. Do yourself a favor and save your money for something better, like Civilization 3 or Stronghold."
2,Really can't honestly review,The seller I purchased this from sold it as new yet it came without packaging & unsealed. I didn't use it because I couldn't trust it hadn't already been used. I have not replaced that one with another yet. So really....I can't share good or bad on the product itself.
5,Leonid Kogan: the unforgettable violin's legend!,"The interpretative art of Leonid Kogan was always overshadowed by the figure of David Oistrakh. But his name and relevance -against all the odds- has been enhancing by itself, thanks to the time's steps and the legendary transcendence his faultless technique and amazing phrasing.In this album we will be able to listen his well commented performance in Salzburg Festival in 1978, when he was in his 54; owner of an overwhelming expression, virile attacks and superb tonality, this album deserves a status place into your important collection.Don't miss it."
2,Average at best,"There are a lot of books out there these days that deal with creative thinking. This book is average at best. It's a book where the authors cobbled some creative techniques with bios of famous thinkers. It's a simplistic approach that, at best, will benefit the reader who has read little in the field."
2,Authors should take the advice they peddle...,...then maybe they would present some original ideas that readers haven't heard many times before.
4,Journey Home,"The book I read was very exciting.The book was abouta girl named Yuki,her family was one of the families that gotout of Topaz where the concentration camps are.Now she was leaving in a apartment in Salt Lake City.She left behindsome freinds in Topaz.She later got out of the apartment andwent home.They stayed at a japenese chapel.They were later rejoined bytheir freinds that they left some of them were alive.Yukiand her family made more freinds that helped them get throughthe stuff times and the good.Her brother that were in the army had come back to them.He was having some trouble over the lost ofhis freind.On Thanksgiving Day they all seem tocome together."
1,Its a tranqulizing dart.,Ever heard someone use imagery so beautifully to convey a scene and then nothing really ever happens? Thats what this whole book is. Its like taking a super quick dose of Nyquil.
4,Solid,"The notable success story from this compilation has been Jack Johnson, but as the Aware compilations go; this was a very solid package. The overall mood is upbeat and it is a good sampler both of the featured artists and of the Aware compilations. Ideal background music while performing household chores or just sitting on the back deck. The bonus track is ""Another American Pie"" by Bleu."
5,Best book about women's bladders throughtout the life cycle.,This book is used in my Conitinence Center to help my clients understand more fully the bladder and what influences it in a lifetime. It is invaluable teaching tool and has assisted with the work that I do to reverse this embarrassing condition. It is good reading for women at any stage in life and the earlier a woman gets a handle on the pelvic floor and it's function the better quality of life will follow.
2,Not for Art use.,The colors do not mix well together to make other colors. I had an art lesson to do on Purple and we could not get a shade of purple for the life of us i was very disappointed luckily i had tempera paint in the primary colors at home so that we could start over. The paint is more like gel and it is hard to paint with . My kids did not like it because the coverage was light and it was slimy
3,Not as good as expected,"I bought this because Crayola is known for their quality products. It does wash off easily both clothes and person, however it reminds me of jelly (the kind you eat) so I won't be purchasing this one again in the future. Very disappointed in product and won't recommend it to friends/family that is for sure."
2,Not a good choice!,"Like others have said, this is a gel-like consistency and doesn't get the right effect on any kind of paper. Also, the colors do not mix--they either make black or some other odd, dark color."
2,hard to work with,"Adequate for a toddler to mush around and explore, not good for actual painting. We tried it on paper--works fine, it is more like a gel than a paint. Colors don't mix well. We tried it on pumpkins without much luck, wouldn't adhere to the surface. Washes up easily. After we're done with these tubes I won't buy again."
1,Great for Grafiti,"In Arizona, you must be 18 or older to buy spray paint. Sooooo, I just discovered the thick paint on my driveway and block wall is Crayola washable fingerpaint. And its not as washable as they say, I had to scrub multiple times with a metal brush, grafiti remover, and a lot of water. Some instructions on Crayola's website about how to remove it from surfaces other than hands would be useful. If you want your child to grow up to be a grafiti artist, this is a great product."
2,Better options out there,"Usually we are very impressed with Crayola art products, but these paints were definitely an exception. The primary reason I bought them was because they were washable, and I've never had a problem with removing Crayola products from clothes, rugs, etc. With that said, these paints are definitely washable, but at a cost. The paint is a very thick texture, similar to hair gel. My daughter doesn't mind using her hands to paint with it, but my 21 month old son can't stand having it on his hands. The texture makes it very difficult to make any shapes beyond smudges. The color is very watered down and faint, no matter what type of paper you use. The end result is a very muddy mess. Since it's so thick, it takes quite a while to dry on paper. My hope was for the kids to create some art projects we could hang on the wall, but these paints definitely wouldn't be ""wall worthy."""
1,THEY STAIN TABLES!,"My daughter received these paints as a gift and used them on paper. Some of her work went off the paper and onto a pottery barn white children's play table. The paint has left stains all over the table despite attempts to clean it up immediately. The purple paint has turned pink in our attempts to clean. The rest of these paints are in the GARBAGE, and we will never buy these again. I'm off to continue scrubbing in the hopes that something works."
4,Smooth voice. . .,"If I had heard ""Tal Cual Es"" before I heard ""Un Mundo Diferente,"" I would have given this CD a 5 stars rating. Unfortunately, I heard ""Un Mundo Diferente"" first and I gave it a 5 stars rating. This 1999 CD isn't as good as his latest release. That being said, ""Tal Cual Es"" is still an outstanding CD.Now that I've heard this CD and ""Un Mundo Diferente,"" I can say that I'm a fan of DIEGO TORRES and I'm looking forward to his future CDs since he seems to be getting better as he ages."
4,triple decker,"Dr Seuss - On the Loose is a short video with three of Dr Seuss's stories: The Sneetches, The Zax and Green Eggs and Ham. The cat in the hat is the narrarator who links the three stories together. The stories are told with the orginal words, a few simple songs and animation that is very faithful to the original drawings. I think (but am not positive) that Dr. Seuss was very involved with this project and wrote the cat in the hat's words. My kids have loved this video for many years. I would never choose to watch it on my own but I can still enjoy snuggling with the kids and watching it with them, which is impressive after all the times the kids and I have seen it. I think it is true to Dr. Seuss which is high praise."
3,Entertainingly written - but too negative,"After reading Adele Parks Game Over and Larger Than Life, one can instantly see the mastery the author has over writing and narrating a novel. The language is funny, clear, and entertaining in some parts.However, her themes tend to be very negative. Certainly, in the end, the characters undergo a realization and surpass any immorality of their previous behavior, but it takes till the very end of the novel until that metamorphasis occurs.The author gives an interview at the end of the book, and indicates that writing an imperfect heroine with complications in her character is more challenging to create. However, as a reader, I want to feel like I am rooting for the main character at least fifty percent of the time."
3,Hmm ...,"This book was good except for the fact that it too way too long for the heroine, George, to get over her worthless boyfriend. IT was certainly entertaining, but I didn't like George much for the first 200 pages. She was self-centered and obessed with Hugh. And her looks. (How many ways can the girl say she's fat?) A bit shallow, for sure. Also it made me mad that after she got pregnant and she knew for sure that she was expecting, that she went and drowned her sorrows in alchol. That's awful!"
3,A Sci Fi Necessity,"Any fan of S/F stories has to read 'Monkey Planet'. Its influence, especially through the 'ape' franchise, is evident in all subsequent S/F media. As a stand alone novel, it is a thought provoking and emotional story that unfolds through the reading of message in a bottle. What prevents it from getting four stars is the feeling that it has lost some shine in translation. A personal feeling backed up by no fact whatsoever. A book you have no choice in reading but you will enjoy greatly regardless."
2,Save the money,"When I purchased this book, I was unaware that it was a graphic novel. Not a bad thing in itself, but it is simply a edited down, incomplete version of the anthology, Rath and Storm. I wish I hadn't purchased it because the anthology was much better."
2,Inside of Mikasa Antique White Coffee Mugs Stain,"While these cups, purchased as a gift from a daughter, are a good size, feel comfortable in hand, and look nice, we were disappointed that coffee and tea stains remain in them. They have to be hand washed to get out the stains, and even with that, a lot of rubbing is necesssary. For this reason alone, I would not select them again nor would I recommend them."
2,"barb austin, tx","I ordered this for Christmas from Clickntoys. I'm fairly sure what I ordered was high quality. However, when the package arrived, it actually had 3 animals: melman, gloria, and alex. The return address was from some lady in Ohio, not the store or amazon. They all had tags on them that said ""not available for retail sale."" They looked like cheap animals you'd win at an arcade. I contacted the vendor on 12/22 and they said, ""sorry about that. Keep those and we'll send you the correct product."" I emailed again 2 weeks ago about the status of this order, and have never gotten a reply, or what I paid for. Since my daughter is only 3, she didn't notice the poor quality, and liked getting 3 animals, but I won't order from this company again and caution anyone else to be wary of them. Don't buy from clickntoys."
3,Disappointed,"This bag looks adorable in the picture, and in fact, is still a cute bag now that I have it. However, it is way too large (too tall and too wide). I can see how things could be easily lost in the bottom. I did not try it out to even see if would fit below my double stroller, but it doesn't appear that it would. The material is very stiff, so it would be hard to even fold the top of it down in order to cram it into the stroller basket. Oh, and the bag, itself, feels heavy, so I can't imagine what it would feel like completely packed. Needless to say, I am going to return it."
4,Jerry Joseph & Jackmormons reveiw,"I bought this collection of songs, commonly referred to as an ""album"" for you youngsters, because I heard one of their songs (Climb to Safety) on Sirius XM ""Jam On"" station. I tend to buy the whole album, not just one song, because is supports the musicians and you can find some jems that 29 seconds of preview doesn't reveal on Amazon. Sure enough, ""Savage Garden"", ""North"", and ""Back in the Hole"" are suberb crank it up songs to add to ""Climb to Safety"". Like most albums there is usually one or two songs that work for me and the rest is just the band. This one really stood out. I showcased these four songs on a mix I did that included Gov't Mule, Arc Angels, Moe, Sonia Dada, and Clutch. I have to be careful when driving not to get ticketed for speeding or being too noisy. Jerry Joseph did an awesome job on this album and I look forward to more."
2,"Boring, Recycled Music","This is okay backround music, but a big waste of money. This album consists of musicians of really mediocre ability perfoming very un-original music that we've all heard a million times before by many similar sounding bands. It seems that they do write there own songs, but listening to them really just sounds like going to a bar and listening to a cover band play music that you like, it's just not played very well."
2,"Good film, terrible DVD.",'Angel and the Badman' is a very good western. It is a very good western because it is character driven. The American west is simply the canvas on which its story is told.The 'Lazerlight' DVD of this fine film is of very poor quality. DO NOT BUY IT. There are better DVD versions available.
2,"It is useful to read it, but I do not like the writting style of this book","This book pointed out a lots of general mistakes that parents may make. It is useful to know all of these aspects that parents should pay attention. But the authors made me feel that I am already a bad parent, and I need to be taught as a child. That makes me feel irritated."
5,Great Book on Foundational Programming,"This is the first non-programming-language book I have read during my career as a Programmer and I really lucked out. This is a book all beginning programmers should read to give them an expansive base of understanding about the full scope of code construction. Practices which I have learned and applied through journeyman-type education are fully explained and out-lined in this text. The text is well-written and easy to read, and possesses a wealth of other resources and references to allow you to continue studying any of the many topics discussed. For clarification, though, this is not a code-reference book, and while giving many excellent examples of the techniques applied, with not give you any language specific syntax or rules."
3,Code Complete Book,"I think this is a good book for software programmers to read, expecially early in their careers or right at the beginnin. It presents logical, structural approaches to designing semi to very complex software but what software isnt complex these days....I only gave it 3 stars because I think they need another more recent update as several of the references are a bit antiquited."
5,Excellent Book - Must read for all Software Developers,This is a must read for all software developer who wants to write production level code.I have read this book Cover to Cover once and plan to do it once again.I am sure your code will improve day one if you strongly believe what is written in the book and follow the advice
4,Nice review,"I have spent the last few weeks reading this book. On one hand the book is easy to read and presents a lot of good material. But it really reflects mainly what I learned in my undergraduate curriculum. I did not see a lot of new material, but I have also met many who did not practice these things. The best thing about the book is the checklists. They are great starting points for making your own checklists and put together a lot of things that are easy to overlook in the moment of creation."
3,"Instead of referring to this book, just ask the question ""why?"" to yourself all the time while you are working on a software","I started reading this book after reading the rave reviews. I religiously read first three chapters, after which I got bored and skimmed through the rest of the book.It is a nice read with little substance. If you have good experience in Java (or maybe C++) and know basic data structures and algorithms theory, then this will not give you much information.As the preface clearly says we can find all the techniques in it in various other sources. Well, if you are experienced enough, instead of referring to this book, just ask the question ""why?"" to yourself all the time while you are working on a software."
5,Most Important Book for Developers out ther,This is by far the most important book for anyone who writes code. After reading this book you'll feel like the best programmer around. I used to think I wrote good code until I read this book. It has really showed me how to write great code. If you have never read this book you absolutely have to.When I first bought the book I started in the chapters about variable names and comments and eventually went back and read the earlier chapters. If the first few chapters turn you off to the book try hopping around at first and come back to those chapters.
5,An essential volume for your bookshelf,"The original Code Complete has long been regarded by many serious software developers as a ""must have"" compilation of software construction best practices. CC2 has similar breadth and depth and has been thoroughly updated to include discussion of emerging methodologies as extreme programming and best practices such as refactoring.Steve McConnell provides a balanced, thoughtful discussion of competing opinions along with a wealth of references to additional materials covering specific topics in more detail. At the same time, McConnell has a clear voice articulating his judgment on various controversial topics.Overall, CC2 is an essential book to include in your library whether you're just starting out in your career or an old grey hair responsible for mentoring teams. In both cases, CC2 puts a mountain of software construction best practices at your fingertips."
5,A Must read for every programmer,"This is an excellent book. Software life cycle can be divided into multiple stages: requirements specification, architectural design, writing code, testing and deployment. This book is covering one stage of the software life cycle, which is software construction (writing code).The book is great, giving a lot of real world's statistical data to support and explain each point.The book covers software construction in a great detail, explaining and discussing every possible point related to writing code.The only criticism that was said about this book is that it didn't mention or discuss security related issues in code construction, but I think that this doesn't decrease the value of the book."
3,Complete but a little borring,Code complete is the right title for this book. Sadly most people find it extremely hart to read it. Its great as a reference but reading it word for word is as interesting as watching grass grow. Don't get me wrong. This is a great book. Everyone should at least hold it for once. But do not try to read it as a book. The first 300 pages will be boring. When the actual code chapters begin it gets better but still tends to be tedious.A great book for beginners but a little boring read for advanced users.
4,Good for beginner,"As a beginner programmer, you might want to read this in your better interest. As 3 years programmer like me, this good helps me very little. If you graph the helpfulness of this book you will get y = 1/x (restrict x >= 0) where y = helpfulness, and x = time you spent programming."
4,Reduce Code Complexity,"After read it from begining to end, I think that CC2 has suficient new information to invest in. Why? because like many programmers, sometimes unexperinced sometimes with too much experience, I saw how some errors come again and agin. Posibly CC2 is too closely related to a Style Guide of programming, however I've seen suficiently too much ""artist"" and ""lone rider"" in this area.This a First to read book after knowing some language. If you want to arrive somewhere we need a little methodology (I'm sorry but we need it). Like CC2 i feel that a good aproach to project success is controling complexity. Don't miss to transform and simplify your design (not your code!!) to help to understand programmers and future designers.After it don't forget basic Patterns, and try to forget some miraculous solutions."
1,You won't sharpen your skills after reading this book,"I have no idea how this book is highly rated.It's a cookbook about everything and every known ""skill name"" ( probably ).But can you learn something by hearing lots of skill name?""Be aware of the difference between string pointers and character arrays.""Hmm, that's all?Did you learn something by reading above?Or Did you get remind something by reading above?Skill is practical only after measuring trade-off and context.Definitely Garbage book, waste precious forest resource."
3,Getting a bit dated,I bought this book because everyone was talking about it being such a great book. I am halfway through the book and plan on reading it cover to cover. Overall it is written well and I'm picking up some good points but the content is more than ready for revision 3. Very little mention of .NET and code samples go back to classic C. Alot of the studies quoted are from the seventies and eighties. I suppose maybe I should have looked at the copyright before I bought because it is just getting a bit dated.
3,Good for a fresher,Here are the positive aspects you find:1. Tries to cover possible issues that could effect coding practices2. Tries to give names for the common coding problems3. Tries to explain what is meant my quality of the code4. Tries to explain logistics behind choosing one coding practice against another5. Could definitely make a novice programmer a better programmerHere are the things I don't like:1. Tries to make money by making a big book. This book doesn't need to be this big2. Tries to present obsolete data some times to support nothing3. Unrelated (to the title of the book) some times meaning less sidebars
5,A great update to an already terrific book,"The first edition was one of the few books I keep within arm's reach. This update is even better. If you're a programmer, you probably need this book."
5,A difficult concept explained with cartoons,"It's surprising to learn that the comics aren't all bad. After all, they're teaching our kids concepts like friction, drag, thrust, and quantum mechanics. Kakalios writes with expertise about the subject and, at times, his book is hard to follow. He does include an appendix with key equations for his readers. I'd love to take his physics course."
4,Really good!,"I read this book and found it very interesting and full of scientific easy facts. And above all, they are all connected with the world of comics and cartoons (super-heroes above all) that is a world that I follow since I was about 11 years all.Now I am a director and write and direct animated cartoon series, I have a background in Physics and for this reason I find this book one of the best I ever read.Thank you, very nice (and interesting) work!!"
3,If you know your superheroes but not your physics...,"With such an intriguing title (and a recommendation from a tai chi classmate), I had to pick up this book when I saw it in the library. Unfortunately, I'm not really the right audience for it: the ideal reader is familiar with the characters referenced while not knowing the physics, while I know the physics but am wondering who the heck these superheroes are? Okay, Superman and the Flash, fine. But Ant-Man, the Atom, or Iron Man? So I was at a disadvantage.Given that, I ended up finding the book a bit dry and long-winded, though with some entertaining and enlightening bits, such as the revelation that poor Spiderman killed his girlfriend through a misapplication of Newton's Laws. So if you know the superheroes but not the physics, read someone else's reviews and decide. But if you know the physics already, this probably won't excite you."
5,Enumclaw Adventure School Review,"When the mother of thirteen year old Francie allegedly falls and hits her head, Francie is grief striken, and her life changes drastically. No one is home to cook her and her father dinner, no one is there to look after her father when he drinks, except her. She wishes her mother was still alive, and it is a blessing when she meets Ruthie, the girl who saved Francie's life when she was bit by a rattle snake. Ruthie and Francie become friends, but will they be able to remain close as the mystery in the past of their lives becomes more clear? Between family, rumors and neigbors, the girls no longer know who to trust. Racial division in thir town may tear apart their lives, and their friendship."
3,What I think of this book,"Well written, found it hard to put down at times. It really brings out the meaning of true friendship. Also shows that the color of your skin doesn't mean anything nor, does it matter where friendship comes into play."
1,"Boring, dull, a chore to read","Nothing interesting in this book, well written but dull, a chore to read, characters dull and the heroine extremely stupid."
1,dull dull dull,"This is the 2nd or 3rd book I have read by this author and I have to say I will not try her again. I have to agree with the 1 review that I thought it was boring, not much going on til the very end and I had to push myself to read to the end hoping that it was going to get better. It did not. I saw all the glowing reviews and I thought I would try it. Not much happened way into the story. It could have been so much better using the plot where the hero tries to find out more about the author of the book society is conflicted about. That would have made it a little more exciting! Instead both the hero and the heroine go round and round about their feelings and the story doesn't go anywhere. Pretty blah."
4,A very pleasant read,"I found the characters very pleasant to read about. After an atrocious book I had read earlier I was looking for something to take the bad taste out, so to say, and this book did that very well. I liked Andrew's character very much and was rooting for him all the way. Pretty decent, sweet guy though sometimes sappy, and who has been in love with the heroine for sometime. Catherine is not bad, but I was wishing she would come to her senses sooner. These are quite likeable and relatable people, and its a fairly smooth going book with not too much drama.It could have been cut short a bit I think. If you are in the mood for a quiet romance with more or less ordinary people, pick this up. If you are in the mood for something very dramatic with lots of twists and turns and complex characters, this is probably not it."
3,Least favorite Jacquie D'Alessandro Book,"I love Jacquie D'Alessandro's books and ever since the first one I read, I got hooked on it. This particular book was just ok to me. I felt that I didn't quite connect with Catherine Ashfield and felt that Andrew was too good for her.The plot itself was interesting and it was a little unexpected towards the end when solving the mystery. I would still highly recommend Ms.D'Alessandro's books."
3,disappointment,"I was disappointed with this book because I happen to like this author a lot and I go through each of her books within a day and yet this one just dragged. Lady Catherine just irritated me. She was such a shrew!! Andrew seemed to be too good for her. In A'Lessandro's previous book, ""Who Will Take This Man"", Lady Catherine just seemed so much nicer as Phillip's sister but yet right at the start of this book, she seemed almost mean. I would recommend A'Lessandro' other books before recommending this one."
1,Product didn't work,"I plugged the rat zapper tale into my zapper ultra, and it didn't work. I even waited until I caught a rodent in my zapper to see if the indicator lights would light up... no such luck. At least my zapper ultra works. Unfortunately, my husband threw out the packaging as soon as the zapper tale arrived; therefore, I probably cannot return it."
1,BEWARE!,"Beware the Amazon tickler ""Customers who bought this item also bought..."" When I saw that, I naturally thought the Rat Tale would work with my Rat Zapper. Wrong! I bought a brand new Rat Zapper and a Rat Tale to go with it. Lo and behold, when I unpacked my purchases, I found that the Rat Tale only works with Rat Zapper Ultra - which is NOT the one I bought. ""Just return it"" you might say? Well, the Rat Tale itself cost only $11.99. But with shipping it was closer to $20. With some investigation, I discovered that the seller charges a restocking fee. So if I return it and pay for THAT shipping and then pay for a restocking fee on top of that, I'd just be throwing away good money after bad. Not worth the hassle. So if you buy a Rat Zapper, be SURE you have the right model before you purchase this Rat Tale."
1,zapped,I gave this 1 star however i did not get to use it because the actual zapper is crap and a waste of money.
1,This place is out of business!,"This company is out of business. I did not need this attachment and there is no future support if your rat zapper goes dead. (However, I do love my rat zapper). You should read about the company that makes this, the inventor went bankrupt suing Victor. And his sister was his main investor -- Michael Landon's ex-wife!!! Yes, THAT Michael Landon."
4,Rat Tale Really lets you know,"The Rat Tale let me know as soon as I came down the basement steps that the Rat Zapper had ""sprung"". The only problem is the wire should be longer to let you place the mouse further away from the trap"
5,Helps identify when the trap has sprung.,We've installed our Rat Zapper up in the false ceiling tiles and it's nice to be able to know when you've got one of those nasty critters in the trap without having to pull it out of the ceiling to check.
4,Should be helpful if we zap anything.,Haven't had any zapping yet but seems to be handy to check on those hard to reach traps. Glad to have the additional help.
4,If you have you Rat Zapper in a tough to get at location make sure you get this,Make things much easier to find out if I caught anything without having to go into my attic all the time to check. Sometime get false positive readings when there is nothing in the trap
3,Didn't last long,"While the piece fits, and was useful, it came to the same problem as the last I ordered and the stock one. breaking on the right side of the truck while under heavy speed.probably not to much to do with the part itself but just the amount of force I put my truck under."
3,"Not Best Quality, But 2 Classic Hitchcocks for a Great Price","I am not going to re-summarize how much fun these oldHitchcocks are. I'll just say that they are the best of his oldGaumont British films. Look elsewhere on Amazon for reviews.This Whirlwind double feature is of okay quality ... The picture is mildly soft and the sound is a bit muddy and hissy (not too bad, but the occasional line of dialogue is hard to understand --subtitles would have helped!) But, it is acceptable if you just want to enjoy these two films together for [the] price ... I certainly did.For extras, the DVD includes a somewhat interesting newsreel from the time period and a crummy Porky Pig cartoon, that was beofre the good Warner Bros cartoons and seems to have been strangely edited by Whirlwind. The idea was to make it like a theatrical double feature from the late 30s, but it just seems like public domain stuff that Whirlwind had to chuck on. The poster pics in the booklet are nice."
5,Very nice!,"If you're looking for a simple version of these two films, as I was, this set fits the bill. Sound and picture are good- of course, they're from the 1930's, so it won't be perfect- and what more do you need? (There are Criterion versions, which I suppose are better, but they cost much more.)"
3,GOOD VALUE FOR THE MONEY,"I bought these for my 5 month old, but they are a bit big for him. However, my two year old loves them... He uses them to ""teach"" me things like, ""The cars going round and round in a circle now mom."" I gave it a three because it is a good toy, but i could live with it or without it."
3,Not the best....,"My daughters and I love the Laugh and Learn line of products, however, these keys turned out not to be the best. They don't really do much and do not keep my daughters as entertained as some of the other Laugh and Learn products. Okay for the price, just don't expect it to be as good as the other products from this collection."
2,Too Heavy,"The keys are pretty big and heavy. Not what I expected. You can remove them from the ""keychain"" but it's still a pretty bulky item, especially for a 10 month old. I love the Laugh and Learning series, but this one was a dud."
2,Not The Best Set of Keys,"My son LOVES the other Laugh and Learn toys, but this one is flop. The keys are huge and the keychain is just too large to even resemble a set of keys. The three buttons that make noise are ok, but the toy is awkward to handle. Our child shows little interest in this toy, he prefers his other little sets of keys that he can handle easily. This toy came in a set with the puppy and phone, which we love. Overall these keys are not a great toy for little hands."
4,A different kind of Rods,"I'd always used the Hot Rods by Calato. But I'm very partial to my Regal Tip brushes. So one day I gave these Thai Sticks a go. I like 'em. The fan shaped ones are not my faves, though. After playing out with them, I've ended up preferring the straight sticks. If you want more volume and a louder ""whack"" sound, these fan sticks are for you."
1,Horriable,Spend the money and get the Baby Bjorn back pack!!! I tried and tried to make this back pack work and it was a hassle. There are too many straps and I couldn't get my son out of it without someones help. If you are trying to save the money which I did...DONT. Spend the extra money and get the baby bjorn it is the most comfortable back pack carrier for you as well as your baby. My son loves it. He even falls asleep in it facing forward. I use it everywhere.
3,Not quite lock and load,"We've used this carrier for hiking and around the house. It's great to use when there's someone to help you put it on.However (as another reviewer notes above) there are 2 buckles and 2 slide/lock clasps to deal with. You can ""pre-lock"" two of the clasps and one of the slides. But the remaining ones need to remain open in order to put the baby into the carrier. Unfortunately, this makes the carrier next to impossible to attach by yourself. The slide clasp is particularly frustrating, as the baby waits (typically impatiently) to be placed into the carrier.Also the pouch in the front is too small to hold much more than a cell phone, so don't expect to carry your diaper/bottles in the carrier.Overall, this is a good product that could use some ergonomic improvements considering the need for fast in/out of baby and more storage."
4,I love this carrier and it is a great buy..,"This carrier is overall great. It is easy to figure out, easy to use. You can get it on and off quickly and easily. It makes a trip to the grocery store a lot less stressful! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that this carrier does put some strain on my neck. I first bought the Parents of Invention The Ultimate Baby wrap carrier. Boy was that a mistake!"
2,not user-friendly or baby-friendly,"I registered for this carrier because I liked that it could be used as a front carrier, facing in and out, and a back carrier. I have never used it as a back carrier, but it is not a good front carrier. I have tried it several times with my son and he hates it. It is such a struggle to get him in and out, the leg openings are too tight, and when I tried to adjust it to use facing out, the support was still in his face. I know many people who have sworn by their carriers, mostly Baby Bjorn. It I had it to do over again, I would definitely spend the extra money to get a better carrier."
2,I don't care for it.,"This carrier was nice to use when our daughter was smaller. (she is almost 5 months and is 16 pounds now) She just does not fit in it very well. It seems that her thighs are too big for the leg holes and getting her in and out of it is a pain. When she is facing forward, the front of the carrier rubs on her face. So we have to fold the front over and so that she can see. In regards to comfort, it was fine for me. On the other hand, my husband can't stand it. I guess for $30, if you are going to use it on a daily basis for the first couple of months of your baby's life, then it's worth it. But right now for us, it's worthless so it's going to Goodwill."
2,Couldn't use it,"I bought this carrier after reading all the positive reviews and seeing the price. However, I didn't use it much after I got it. It was a hassle to get on and off, and by the time I got it on with my daughter in it, she would be upset and wanted to get out.It was a good price new, but I ended up getting a used Bjorn on ebay for not much more $36 shipped. I sold this one for $5.It seems to work for some people, so if you fall into that category, more power to you. If not, there are other ways of getting a decent priced carrier."
1,Don't buy this product.,"I'm a first time mom and found this carrier to be difficult to use.First, I found it very difficult to get my son's legs in and out of the carrier. I would end up waking him every time I took him out of the carrier.Second, his face was smothered in my chest. I was constantly checking to make sure he could breathe.Third, when he was 2 1/2 months old his legs were being squeezed so tight in the leg opening that his feet looked like they were turning color and he's not a huge baby. He was 12 lbs when I stopped using this product.When he was 3 Months old I got the Hip Hammock by Playtex...Much better product. Very easy to get the baby in and out of without a struggle, it was a much better position for the baby (he could breathe) and I've read other reviews of parents using it with children up to 2years old."
5,A lifesaver for colicky babies,"I bought this for our 1st baby, because, I wanted one of everything. Just in case I needed it. I used it mostly when my daughter was colicky. It was the only way I could get anything done, because, she wanted to be held ALL THE TIME. It did take a little while to figure the thing out. (As far as how to adjust it to make it fit right.) Then it was a breeze. She loved being able to face outward and look around while I cleaned the house. I used it until she was about 20 lbs. (9 mo.)I tried to use the backpack feature, but, I am way too paranoid about safety. It didn't feel as secure as it did wearing it on the front. I would definately reccomend this to any new mom. It's also great for taking places that strollers don't fit. Great product, and serves same purpose as more expensive ones."
1,Difficult to get baby in and out,"I would recommend spending the extra money on a Baby Bjorn if you're going to be using this often. The Snugli is difficult to get the baby in and out of, and there are too many straps. Plus, you have to have someone help you buckle and tighten the straps because they're in the back. The straps also don't stay tight, and loosen as you walk around."
2,difficult to put on,I got Snuggli and Bjorn for my baby shower. I was planning on returning Bjorn to get my big $$$ back. But Snuggli was so difficult to use with all those straps and belts that my impatient baby had a fit every time. Baby Bjorn worked better.
4,GREAT for price!,"I loved it when my daughter was a bitty thing! Now that she is close to 14 pounds compared to 6lbs 12oz...I find myself using it more as a back pack. In the back pack position, I could still have her facing away from me. That way, she can see other things while I went about my business. However, if I turned her towards projects I was tending to, she got bored and started fussing. I don't rightly know if it is recommended to turn her backwards in the Snugli while in back pack position but, I just didn't bend over...mainly to wash dishes or water the garden...go for walks, shopping....great! Love it! Just don't bend over while using this as a back pack (picture them doing a back bend..not good!).In the front position, I find that my lower back gets sore after 15 minutes and I need to take the whole thing off and stretch. However, I've always had a lower back issue so, it could just be me perhaps, I have this unit adjusted incorrectly."
2,This carrier was not for us,"We received this carrier as a gift, so we didn't have much input on the selection. We liked the idea of it being a front or back carrier, however it just doesn't seem to work with our bodies. Our daughter seemed to be carried with her head by my ear when I tried it as a front pack. The plastic side buckles to hold the child in place were not that secure, so when we used it we still held her for fear of them opening up - defeats the purpose of having your hands free! We much rather use our FABULOUS Quattro tour system than this!!!"
3,WIsh I DID use it.,I wish I used this item. Baby doesn't seem comfortable and no matter how I adjust it I feel like I have it on wrong. I really think this would be a great item for me and baby but it just doesn't seem to fit my baby's idea of a good fit.
1,horrible,I was given this item for my baby shower and I was so excited. I think I used it a total of 5 times and my son is now 21 months old and I have a 2 month old daughter and I gave the snugli away. I couldn't put it on by myself cuz I couldn't snap the back strap and without that snapped there was no supporting the carrier. I am now afraid to buy another more expensive front carrier because I disliked this one so much.
2,not if your petite,"When the (multiple) straps felt tight, there was at least a foot of extra strap on nearly every one; cumbersome details I did not enjoy dealing with. Would not recommend for smaller women (around 5'2"" 110 lb). As well, I always felt like my baby's forehead was right at my chin, not lower. I have not used it as a back carrier, would probably like this better.My husband likes this carrier, he's over 6'."
1,"Super Frustrating, uncomfortable and poorly designed","We received this carrier as a shower gift and I was really excited about using it. I tried it a few weeks ago and couldn't really figure it out... (seemed really uncomfortable and ridiculously difficult to use) plus baby was too small at the time.I tried it again today... I felt like the baby was totally in front of my face... literally, I couldn't see around her and it was not comfortable for either of us. My husband tried it, and he hated it even more than I did. Not well designed... our baby hated it and it just seemed impossible for one person to put it on without assistance. We are taking it back to exchange it and pay the extra money for a baby bjorn."
2,Get the Bjorn please,"We registered for the Snuggli with our first child because it was much more economical than the Bjorn. Now with our second baby, I went out and purchased the Bjorn and it is far superior. The snuggli is cheaper but you get what you pay for. It offers little back support and numberous snaps and buckles that are a pain when handling an infant. The Bjorn is far superior- fabric is great and it is much easier to snap AND it offers excellent back support. I am usually a cheap skate but this is money well spent."
4,Great Carrier,"This is a wonderful carrier, there is no need to spend the outrageous money on the name brand ones. I had a different one from Infantino first, that I returned after wearing it for 10 minutes because it KILLED my back! The waist strap on this carrier is excellent for taking the strain off your back.Although, it looks tricky with all the different straps, once you get it intially adjusted, it is very simple to use! This is the only one I could actually get my baby into by myself. Just get everything set, and do a trial run while you are at home.Would recommend!!Gave 4 stars instead of 5 b/c the directions can be a little confusing to figure out."
1,Not a good carrier at all!,"This product is terrible. I tried it on once. My baby slid to the bottom and her face was completely covered. There are too many snaps and buckles. I got a sling from Hotslings instead. It works great and is MUCH LESS COMPLICATED. I found that when having a baby, keep it simple and LESS IS MORE. If you want a less complex way to carry your baby, go to www.hotslings.com and check them out."
2,Shoulder Strap Problem,"This carrier has been nice to use when I walk my dog or go shopping instead of bringing a stroller. The shoulder padding tends to slide around since they are not attached to the straps. When this does happen, the straps dig into my shoulder. Also, it took quite some time before my son was able to face forward. He could hold his head well enough long before he was tall enough to face forward, but my baby didn't mind facing me. Some similar carriers fold down by the babies face so they can face forward easier."
4,Universal Carrier,"Excellent item! We used it for a few weeks with our daughter facing us, and soon switched to facing her out. When she gets older we can use it as a back carrier. It's like 3 carries in one!"
1,Awful,"Speaking specifically about the front-facing position (that is, a small infant facing inward), I really hate this product. It is complicated to learn how to use, and very awkward to put on without someone's assistance-- useless to me, since I need a carrier when I am home alone doing chores. It has very awkward side clips that are hard to fasten when the baby is loaded, resulting in an angry baby and an irritated parent. The strap that goes across the back is difficult to reach without help. Once the baby is loaded, her head bangs against your chest when you walk around. Every time I have tried to use it, I just get mad. Why on earth would someone design such an annoying and complicated product for use with an infant?"
2,Too bulky,"This carrier is way too bulky and a complete pain to put on. I registered for it after reading some favorable reviews but wish I didn't. I am going to try another brand. If your baby is small you have to pull all the straps so much that you have tons of things dangling all over the place. It is hard to get her in and out of it without major disruption to her, and no matter how I adjust it the left shoulder continually slips for me. It is also too small in the waist adjustment for my husband who is a pretty big guy. I thought the Bjorn carriers were overpriced but I am going to try another brand. Very disappointed."
2,Not fond of this one,"I am disappointed with this product. It is difficult to get baby in and out. While she seems ok when facing in, when we put her facing out it cut into her little chubby thighs at only 4 mos. old and cut off her circulation. Haven't tried any of the other carriers, but I prefer a sling to this one."
3,Not sure you should waste your money,"I registered for this thinking it would come in handy. My son was born at the end of April and weighed 8 lbs. 1 oz. By the time I actually felt like using this carrier, he was quite heavy and it was very awkward walking, especially outside with the sun shining on him. I suppose if your thinking about using it in your house, it might be okay. I think I used it twice and my son is now 3 months old and I don't have any desire to use it again."
2,Hard to use!,"The neck support for the newborn position didn't like to stay put and my poor baby's neck flopped around. Now that he is a little older and faces out, the neck support is support flap is supposed to tuck under, but it keeps getting in the way. Alex just chews on it when it doesn't shimmy up over his eyes. I haven't tried it on my back yet. The whole system is a bit uncomfortable for me, but better than some I've tried. If you lean forward just a little, the baby flops away from you, though. I must admit, I don't know what I'd do without it while watching both my baby and my sister's 11-month old, though!"
2,Good-until you use the front carrier,"I LOVED this until my daughter could face outwards. I know it says that the part that once supported the baby's head goes down, but it doesn't. I could not get the upper part out of her face when she was facing out. I had to fold it under the straps. Anyway, I returned it and got the other one by Snugli. I think it's called the Comfort Vent. Much easier to figure out. Just my $.02."
2,Very Uncomfortable,"This carrier was so uncomfortable that our daughter cried when we put her in it. there is a stiff piece of fabric that the baby's head rests on, while they face you, and it always left a big red line under he chin. it was very combersom to put on.spend the extra $$ and get a baby bejorn. they too are tricky to put on, but so much more comfy for you and baby!"
4,Great Value,"I received this carrier as a gift when my fifth child was born. He is now nearly six months old and we use this carrier almost every day. He loves to ride in it facing out toward the world, especially when grocery shopping. It is very comfortable for me to wear it for long periods, however my husband is too large for it; the straps won't go around his waist and his shoulders are too wide for it.I also love that the whole thing is machine washable and the pouch is removable with belt loops on the back. All in all, the best carrier I've used."
4,Very good!,"This book caught me up from page one and held me with rapt attention. I learned a lot about Tourette's, which I found interesting, but be aware the author crosses from the book being a neurological thriller into psychological horror toward the end. There was one scene toward the end I would prefer to have seen done differently, but overall felt this was a very good book with some very interesting characters. I shall definitely read more by Mr. Hecht."
4,Struggling Under the Burden of Advance Praise,"To read through the accolades on the dust jacket, I expected miracles, or at least fireworks. The book was entertaining and a worthy first effort, but not exactly the ""most psychologically sophisticated thriller"" this reviewer has ever read. The many interesting subplots kept me up late into the night. Unfortunately, even the author had trouble keeping track; one or two story lines got lost. In the end, I found the race to the final conflict more exciting than the ultimate outcome. Still, it was well worth the three dollars and the trip to the bargin bin."
4,Well written,"An absorbing, atmospheric, modern Gothic mystery; well researched and realistic, yet ultimately cartoonish. Think the Fall of the House of Usher meets the Tasmanian Devil. Still, a good read."
5,Wow...this one will keep you breathless!,An outstanding story with realism in its mystery...which will blow you away.
4,An amazing first effort,"I actually found myself pouting when I finished this book. I'm electrified to have discovered this author,whose writing ,some how,some way,reminds me of Anne Rice.It's suspenseful,sensual and very beautiful.I'm a very fast reader,and was constantly forcing myself to go back and read every word,rather than skimming. Thank you Dan,and please keep them coming."
4,A thriller with a difference,"I really enjoyed this book, and was frustrated to hear this is the only book to date by Daniel Hecht. Was great to read a thriller and not be able to guess the ending by the third chapter(an all too common situation). Enjoyed the characters, the mystery of the wrecked lodge, and the extra 'meat' of the story like the Tourettes Syndrome, which I never knew much about. After so many bad thriller genre reads lately, Skull Session was a breathe of fresh air. Thanks to Daniel Hecht-can't wait for your next book."
5,Exciting debut novel,"Tautly written, with great character development, near-science fiction was fascinating projection. Main character has Tourette's Syndrome, which alone makes novel stand out. But when dark things start happening around an ancestral home, there come interesting Jungian twists and reflections."
4,accrate protrail,I liked this book because the protrail of tourettes was very good it was a more realtuic protrail that icy sparks. also the book is very good supences story.i really like a urge all who like thrillers to read it.
2,Irritating and Slightly Ridiculous,"I don't demand Shakespeare when I read suspense thrillers, but this book really bothered me. Two things, in particular, need to be said. First, for the plot to work the protagonist has to be the biggest, most irritating wimp on the planet. I realize the man has Tourette's, and I realize that would affect his interactions with his loved ones, but if once, just once, he pushed a little harder with some of his questions the mystery would be quickly dispelled. Hecht seems to realize this and tries to figure out ways around it, but I don't think he ever really solved the problem. Second, the ultimate answer to the mystery is incredibly silly. It may be plausible, but the reality of the climax is laugh-inducing."
4,Smart!,"Hetch is an intelligent writer! This book is referred to as a ""psychological thriller"" so I now use this phrase to describe the genre I'm interested in."
1,Tourette Syndrome is not a side-show disorder!,"As a college graduate,I can appreciate a budding author wanting to make a buck and attract readers with a character who faces unusual and challenging circumstances, but Tourette Syndrome is not a side show disorder!! Less then 10% of folks like myself who have Tourette Syndrome DO NOT experiance outbursts of uncontrollable obsenities, violent tics, or job unemployment. Depicting 38 year old Paul as some sort of wild, neurological ""anomaly"" incapable of getting his disorder and his personal life under control is not only inaccurate and deeply offensive, but takes away from an otherwise intriging tale."
5,Good job Mr. Hecht,This book literally kept me on the edge all the way thru. It had me guessing all the way I kept changing my mind as to who the home-wrecker was. I thought it was a clever twist the way it ended keep up the good work Daniel.
5,"Therefore, Stand by Wilbur M. Smith","This is an older book on Christian apologetics. Dr. Smith does an excellent job on defining apologetics and pursuing several of the main topics, including Creation, the Resurrection, the righteous judgment to come and peace and joy in believing. He puts forth telling arguments in defense of the faith and in opposition to modern day liberalism and antagonism toward God and God's people and God's work. Throughout the book he produces scholarly research documentation for his positions. I heartily recommend it to thinking Christians!"
5,Great hat for the price!,"nice fit, nice quality for the price, great Christmas gift- my 9 year old Packers fan is going to love it"
5,great snow cap,Great snow cap for the winter showing off my favorite team that was priced at a very low price and was shipped to me fast.
5,Scarred....,"When I read this book for the first time I thought it was a history of skateboarding type book, but I was wrong. It is a book of stories about the people who made skateboarding history!! Keith Hamm did a great job writing this book. He uncovered info that I had never knew or even thought of. I am waiting for more from Keith Hamm especially about Jay Adams and more pool skateing. Yeah!!! Get a copy and read it for yourself. It is a good edition to a skate library. Team AM approved!!"
3,Terrain Twister Review...,"I got this product for my 6 year old nephew for Christmas and I just got the Twister itself, later finding out that I also needed the battery pack too. So when I got that, charged it, and put it in the Twister...I was ready to test it out.It works really well on land. It's somewhat hard to control, because its the opposite of what you think. But you get the hang of it.We also have a pond, and I was a little sketchy about putting it in the water, but I did. It floats, and it does get around in the water too! I kept it near the edge of the pond just in case the batteries decided to run out, apparently they did, but I was able to reach it out of the water.The batteries are annoying. You charge them for 5 1/2 hours but they only work for about 30 minutes."
1,What a Waste of Money,"This is the only toy my 5 year old son begged for this year for Christmas. I don't have a lot of money as I am a single parent, but I saved up and spent the $90 for the Terrain Twister and the battery pack that AMAZON said was required! Christmas morning we discovered that it was the wrong battery pack!!! My son was so disappointed. I told him I would buy the right pack and I did after 2 weeks of searching the stores...What a waste, the twister still is pretty much useless! It only works for about 5 minutes and then stops and it does not work at all in snow! My son is so disappointed and keeps saying he can't believe Santa would make such a junk toy!!! Shame on Tyco for ripping parents off and disappointing the kids (and the parents) and shame on Amazon for making such a big blunder in recommending the wrong pack!"
1,"Fraud is fun, but batteries aren't included","I think the biggest problem I've seen is turning a $70 toy into a $100 toy with the words ""batteries not included"". My issue isn't that there are no batteries (I learned with Tyco last Christmas to check the box) my problem is that the ToysRUs Website on Amazon.com states that this product requires 1-9 volt battery when it actually requires 1-9 volt plus a $30.00 add-on."
1,WALT,"I never tried the snow or the water, but on grass and asphalt, this thing will barely move. It will only travel out of control on pavement in a sideways fashion. It will not go forward as the rotors won't grip. Hardly moves at all in even short grass. Regardless of the battery cost, do not buy this. You will be disappointed. I just ordered Tyco Vertigo & another Stunt car from Amozon.com that use the TMH battery. (...) Good Luck."
1,tdl,"We purchased this toy for our son last year for christmas. What a let down!!! The toy definitely was not what it was shown to be on TV. While this is no big surprise, I at least thought that it would do some exciting things. It would barely move on the grass. We tried it on dirt, sand, and driveway. It never really performed very well. I really don't mean to sound negative, but I am really being honest. For the price, I really thought it would be a better toy."
2,BATTERY DOESNT LAST,"Well my son got the terrain twister this year (FINALLY) for xmas, last year it was sold out and unavailable. He has spent more time charging the battery then he has used it. The battery seems to take forever to charge only to get a few minutes use of it. He is not impressed and I am dissapointed with it also. It was not worth the 80 plus 30 for battery pack I paid."
1,total fraud,Tyco should be ashamed of itself. They mislead parents into thinking the battery is included only to later surprise parents with the price of $35 for a battery that is not included on a $60 gift.The worst part is that we brought the gift to switzerland from florida. When our son went to use it we realized it didn't have a battery and there was no where within 3 hours that had it. The only gift we had brought him from florida which took up one suitcase could not be used!!! We will never ever use a tyco product again
2,Wrong battery pack suggested and recieved,"Here it is two weeks before Christmas and I just received the battery pack suggested and that WAS pictured with the Terrain Twister on here. It is NOT the correct one and lucky for me we have the correct battery pack that is required for the toy, since my grandson has other Tyco RC toys that required the same battery that the Terrain Twister requires and I found it in the basement. I did notice that they have corrected it on here, but too late for me and I now have to return the one that was suggested and sent to me."
1,Worst RC toy ever,"I couldn't agree more with the bad reviews of this toy. I bought 2 of these for my two boys, and they both hated them. It won't go in a straight line, as someone else pointed out, it only goes relatively fast sideways, and can't hardly go at all in grass or dirt. There is almost no control of these things. If my company name was on this rc unit, I would recall it to save face, it's that bad. The commercial's could not be any more misleading as to how well these things move around. Junk."
2,Broke easy,My son quit playing with because is stopped working right. My husband cleaned out the toy box and threw it away.
1,Make sure they send you the correct battery!,There is something about a toy that doesn't come with a battery to make it work. I gave in and bought this toy and rechargeable battery that is required to make it work for my nephew for Christmas. Only to find out that they didn't send the correct rechargeable battery pack for the toy.What a disappointment.
4,Sent in Manufacturer box--oopps!,"I was expecting another ""amazon"" box with the wonderful smile...what I got was this item in the manufactures box! With big letters written exactly what was inside!!!So much for the mystery of Santa! If your kids can read--beware--or be home before them for delivery!"
1,NOT like the commercial!!!!!,"Amen to the folks who have said this is a stupid toy! The commercial shows this thing tearing through all terrain, jumping, going forwards and backwards! These are the key words here---going forwards and backwards. This thing only moves quickly when going sideways. It just spends around senselessly. We tried to run this thing on some dirt and low grass---slow as Christmas when trying to go forward! My son played with it once...then said he'd rather color. I've never seen him pass up an R/C toy for coloring!!!!I was so angry that I called Tyco directly. There's a number on the box! Luckily, they provided me with good customer service by allowing me to send them the stupid thing back. They promise to send me a voucher to purchase another Tyco vehicle that works better. Try it if you're unhappy. (Haven't sent it yet, so let's hope they live up to their word!)BLAH TOY!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Can't Rate Because We Can't Use It,"I would love to rate this toy but upon opening & taking it out of the box (which takes an hour) we discover that there is a special battery pack that must be purchased seperately. this is not shown very well on the box. Tyco needs to make it way more clear that this is the case. Parents are way too busy to have to search & search for this information. I checked the Toys-R-Us info when ordering & it says only that it requires 1 9-volt battery - nothing about the special - $30 extra rechargable battery pack. [...] It just needs to be much clearer or to be most helpful - included in the toy, sure it would be more expensive, but at least it would be there. Now I have to wait til tomorrow - buy it - charge it - & if I'm lucky my kid can play with it by tomorrow night! I tell you this - I'll be hard pressed to ever buy another Tyco toy again. [...]"
1,stinks,Son got for Christmas--no where is it stated need to order battery pack---RUINED his day--will never purchase TYCO product again!!!!
1,unhappy child,"Be aware that this toy needs a power pack that can not be found anywhere in the ""recommended accessories"" and my grandson can not play with this toy until I find one! Also, the recommended accessory was a wrong battery."
1,It's a WASTE OF MONEY$,this toy is a waste of money. People don't buy this toy when i got it last year 4 Xmas it sucked. i can't ride it on the cement or on the road . REALLY PEOPLE IF U BUY THIS TOY YOU'RE WASTING YOU'RE MONEY
4,Awesome R/C,I received Terrain Twister for Christmas and it is awesome. The other day it snowed and it runs really neat on the snow. I can't wait to try it in the sand. I love this thing.
3,Toys R Us - BAD!!,I too purchased the Terrain Twister at Toys R Us as they were offering the battery pack and charger for free!! It has been 3 weeks since I purchased it and only 5 days until christmas and they still don't have them. Why in the world would you advertise such a thing if your not going to have the battery pack available for each terrain twister you sell??? My son is going to open this Christmas day and be so excited that he got it until I tell him sorry you can't play with it because we can't get the battery pack and charger!! Not very happy!!!
3,The battery thing is not worth the extra money!,"My GOSH you already have to pay 70 bucks for the toy, then you get it and realize you need a 30 dollar battery!!! This is hideous to say the least. Who would think about needing a battery that expensive, when the toy is already 70 +? In the rushing of holiday shopping, and ordering off of ebay, computer shopping, etc. some of us, don't have a chance to look over the box before making the purchase. I guess we just figure for that price, everything is included except maybe a few AA's etc. Then you get it and realize your child can't even play with it on Christmas Day because it needs this EXPENSIVE battery! As if the toy weren't expensive enough!!! Why not just charge $100 for the toy and put it in there, tyco? huh? You made my child dissapointed and I do not reccommend this toy at all!!! IT's a rip off!!! Now I have to use my grocery money for the week to go buy a battery to go with this 70.00 toy. Great! I hope this helps others not to get ripped off."
2,Which is better?,"Which one is better or is there even a difference? The red terrain twister with 27MHz or the green 49MHz? Is the green one more powerful. Are the MHz's like a measurement of power in some sort of batttery. And another question, do you have to buy a battery and charger seperately because i saw a review that said his son bought it and he had to buy the battery seperately. Please respond with the title Which is better?"
4,Last years Christmas gift and my son still plays with it !!!,"I got this last year for my son, and he still plays with it. We got the green one and have had no problems with it. We played with it in the snow, pool, grass, as well as indoors on carpet and tile. If your child loves RC toys then they will not be dissappointed. And it's also great for chasing the family pet around...LOL."
2,Terrain Twister Sinks!,The Terrain Twister should not be put in water. It is not water proof. The grey underbody is not sealed and neither are the pontoon augers that propel the machine. It has limited ability to manuever. It does not move in sand well or at all. Some of the simplest turns are hard to make with this system. The controller is very cheaply made. The control buttons are not durable. My unit stopped working 3 minutes after being on water. It never came back to life. It does not live up to the hype. What does? The manufacturers should not be allowed to make the claims they have regarding the toy. This item made them a bunch of money due to these misrepresentations. I am looking into what a consumer can do to make the company compesate those they defrauded.
1,what a disapointment,"i rated this toy a 1 star because we have not been able to use it yet. i ordered this toy off of amazon. i also ordered the ""suggested battery pack"" that came up on my order page. well, guess what, we charged that battery pack christmas day night and went to put it in the twister on the next morning, and it was the wrong one. of course, by now, all the packaging was gone! so i now have to buy another battery! after buying the ""suggested battery pack"" that came up!that sux!"
1,"I don't know if it works yet, because you recommended the wrong battery","Do you know when we found out that it wasn't the correct battery???? You guessed it, Christmas morning. When ordering the Terrain Twister, this website recommended the 9.6V battery to go with it for $20 more. I had read negative reviews, so I knew the battery was needed. Only to find out on Christmas morning after my son tried to insert the battery into the toy that it didn't fit. Now, I have to go back out and spend another $34 on a battery? The manufacturer should just up the price of the toy and include the battery so this doesn't happen in the future! Or, here's a thought, make the same battery to go with all Tyco toys."
4,rosie,"I loved this story :)Rosie is so brave and strong, and deserved her happy ending.Lesley Pearse does it again!"
2,Horrible to assemble,I would have liked to have instructions upon assembling this Kettler Cat Kid Tractor. It was extremely difficult to assemble; harder than any toy we have ever assembled. It could only be assembled by constantly glancing at the picture on the box that was delivered and that did not help very much. I would never recommend for anyone to purchase this.
2,IMPORTANT-BE SURE TO ASSEMBLE FRONT TIRES PROPERLY!,"Like many reviews have stated, the instructions are fairly difficult to understand. I installed the base for the front wheels backwards and did not realize it until after the wheels and locking caps were installed. I was unable to release the locking caps, even after following the directions to remove these that were sent from Kelty. The tires cannot be removed by force either. We were finally able to break apart the entire front wheel assembly, but we were charged $50 to purchase the replacement parts! If you order this project, please be sure that the wheel assemble is correct BEFORE installing the locking caps!!"
4,Purchasing a box of Parts,"This is a nice riding toy. Too bad it is packaged as a box of parts and the purchaser has to spend 3 - 4 hours to assemble it.And let's not fail to mention that the instructions are illustrations only and in different colors from the actual parts.Why don't the manufacturers/Amazon describe unassembled toys as such and include the number of hours, ease of assembly and tools necessary before the child can enjoy the toy.Anna Russo"
2,Missing part,Missing part to front end loader so unable to use. My son has gone from being super excited for his big birthday gift to wanting to send it back.
2,Dissappointed,"I was very dissapointed in this product. First, it takes a while to assemble it then it was much smaller than the description stated. The price was tempting but even if your child is small, the moment you put the child on the seat, the plastic piece bends and touches the wheel making it almost impossible to maneuver. On cement it works great but that is not the intended use. As always, Amazon does not do a good job describing the objects it sells."
4,Kettler CAT Kid Tractor,"The actual vehicle once put together worked quite well. There were a few design situations that could have been done better but, I surmise that these are designed for several different styles of tractors. The only real problem that I see is the horrible directions. I am an engineer and work on mechanical things every day. The directions were very vague and did not detail parts to be used in each case. Very Confusing"
1,False advertisement,"Amazon.com is providing a false advertisement of this product. The tires do not have rubberized tread on them. The tires were completely plastic, which did not agree with the description listed on Amazon's website. I returned the product because that was a big factor as to why I wanted to buy it."
4,Does anyone have assembly instructions?,"I purchased this item ""off the shelf"" and the back kickstand will not move. Can anyone email me the assembly instructions? cjewell@surewest.netTHANK YOU!!"
1,Freakin Nightmare,"We are sending it back. I am not a civil engineer, and I think you need to be to assemble this product. The little metal fasteners on the end of the wheels don't fit. I have no idea how to get them on. And that's the easiest part! Not well explained. Why do these toys have to involve so much assembly? I'm going to from no on looked for already assembled used toys, because this is a freaking nightmare. And don't get the wrong impression, I have put together a LOT of furniture, toys, and other things which needed assembly in my day, I'm not an idiot."
1,Frustrating Toy Tractor,"As mentioned in another review, the tires are completely resin. There are no rubber strips to be found to provide traction. Because of this and the fact that the pedals only control the movement of one back wheel, it is extremely difficult for a child to ride and control. Have you ever seen a frustrated 2/3 year old? It's not pretty! It's a shame because the idea and the look of this tractor is so cool."
4,"Great toy, needs better instructions.",Great toy just not easy to put together. Needs better instructions. Decal needs some works. My grandson love to play with it.
2,Way Too Small!,"My son is almost three and is 36"" tall and he is already too tall for this tractor. Although it is a very cute design aesthetically, it's difficult to steer and and even more difficult to pedal. My little tractor man tried his best to pedal this across our smooth sidewalk, then again on a flat lawn, but it's very hard to do. I'm disappointed in the product and I think it should be labeled for 1.5-2 year olds instead of 2-4 year olds."
4,ASICS low cut running socks,"I was looking forward to wearing this socks, since I'm a jogger and have been getting blisters on one of my feet. I have to honestly say the blistering did not lessened. So, would I buy another pair of this socks, no not really (also not worth the money I paid for, sorry to say). The upside is that the socks feel comfortable when wearing them."
5,Asics Wins Again,"After trying all kinds of socks to walk in, I decided to try these. What a good choice.They're really lightweight, so I thought that they wouldn't work, but the elastic in themkeeps your foot and the sock in place. No blisters, aching or anything. I like the otherAsics socks, but these are far and away my favorite."
4,comfy,"the socks are great, i love the high contoured collar and the extra padding.they took forever to ship, took about 2 weeks+"
4,Expensive...but worth it,"This is the first pair of official running socks I have bought. I thought they were a litle pricey, but after wearing them several times, I think they are worth the cost."
5,A few more masterpieces.,"I can't get enough of Witness,Everybody's Gotta,Queen of Today,and Forever On. This recording gives you more than your money's worth with just those four tracks. But to be honest, even this dedicated fan has to skip a few of the tracks. Still, you won't want to miss what this one does have to offer, although I'd reccommend any of their other CD's to a first time buyer."
1,"Misleading title, trivial book.","The author wrote a fundamental ""How-to"" book for OSX, only introducing each item as a ""problem"", e.g."" I don't know how to..."" or ""I want this or that to happen""...If you are looking for solutions to real headaches, such as the Trash refusing to empty, or error messages infoming you that you lack the privileges to perform an operation, do not look for them in this collection of trivia!I am sorry to have wasted my money on this book. I am sure even a book entitled ""xxxxx for Dummies"" would be on a higher level."
5,The best of the best in Thai Cuisine,This is the classic Thai compendium for all lovers of Thai food. This will tempt everyone to give it a go.
2,Impractical book,"Beautiful and detailed classic Thai cookbook....most recipes impossible for me to make, as always at least one ingredient unavailable in my area"
1,Authentic? Perhaps but impractical in the U.S.,"The book is filled with historical details, recipes are carefully laid out, ingredients are beautifully described. However, if I were living in Thailand, this book would be helpful. Even though I live in southern California where there are plenty of asian supermarkets with fresh fruits and vegetables, the ingredients asked in this book are impossible to find. For example, some recipes ask for mangosteens and other tropical fruits, where to find? I think that the author strikes for absolute authenticity, but as we know, every cook improvises given the available ingredients. The author does not bother to tell us how to substitute any hard-to-find ingredients. This makes the book impractical and useless."
2,Try something even better...,"This book is beautiful, but instead check out Kasma Loha-Unchit's books; especially It Rains Fishes. Excellent explanations and stories about the culture."
5,the best,This is the ultimate in learning about Thai cuisine with a fantastic history of the evolution of Thai cooking with home run recipes !!!!! A MUST buy
5,Woah!,"Simply Stunning. The best cook book on a single cuisine I have ever read. The Larousse of Thai Food. If all cook books were written like this the world would be a better place,"
4,coffee table book/appetizer,"this is a beautiful book.almost destined more for the coffee table than for the kitchen library.recipes are there, but there seems to be a very strong emphasis on recipe context. not an exhaustive resource by far - but is very nice to have anyway."
2,Complicated,"I'm no slouch in the kitchen and I've found nearly every recipe in this book astonishingly hard to make. Most of that is derived from the ridiculous lists of ingredients required to prepare every dish. It may be the most authentic Thai cookbook around, but it shouldn't require you to live in Thailand in order to make anything in it. Even in NYC it's hard to find a lot of this stuff. It probably has a lot of good recipes, but most of us will never know..."
3,For Hardcore fans only,"Casual Beatles fans may wanna skip this one. It's basically a bunch of clips of them going from place to place facing screaming fans and the like, along with a handful of interviews. Nothing earth shattering.But there are a few intriguing moments. There is a clip of Pete Best (original drummer) trying to maintain his dignity during an appearance on ""I've Got a Secret."" Reactions and fallout from John Lennon's infamous statement about the Beatles and Jesus (the statements from KKK leader Bobby Shelton are almost incomprehensible) and the near arrest of the Bay-tels at a Minneapolis motel. The clip of our guys in the Shakespearian skit is a bit had to follow with the screaming crowd. Not much here to write home about. But it's interesting to watch at least once or twice."
3,Fabs video scrapbook,"FUN WITH THE FAB FOUR is another of the many Beatles ""documentaries"" that consist of press conference excerpts, interview clips, an overabundance of screeching Beatlemaniacs and the occasional TV broadcast dub. Televison samples include their Midsummer's Night Dream sketch.The primary drawbacks of this GOODTIMES VHS is a slow running speed, which makes already degraded source material that much the blurrier. For a low-priced peek however, you'll find it most adequate. If absolutely necessary to your Beatles archive, this hour-length melange is available on equally-inexpensiveDVDs."
3,so so,"some good moments. John is hillarious in one of the interviews. if you're not a hardcore fan like me, it's not worth it, otherwise, good to see once."
5,Great Attitude with Tasty Recipes and Helpful Suggestions,"Maybe you're one of those super-sophisticated types that never is faced with needing a potluck entree for 12, a soccer party, Awana meeting, school carnival, staff potluck or any of the other events that lots of folks are required to attend. A bag of potato chips and a big smile usually won't do the trick. I marked at least a dozen recipes in this book from a Autumn spin on the old ""Gorp"" trail mix to clever hot drinks for a crowd like Cranberry Tea and Hot Berry Cider. Nothing too simple or too full of fat and sugar, but definately a useful reference tool for many women in the ""Social Whirl"" of middle America."
3,Over rated!,"Everyone so far is giving this album 5 stars. ""Future world"" is a good record but it's not worth top rating. Pretty Maids best album is without doubt ""Red, hot and heavy"" - get that one first. ""Future world"" is a weaker follow up but of course it has its moments..."
3,PRETTY MAIDS,"I have to admitt i enjoy this album and they remind of another band from that time the tubes.They songs are well written and the rythm section is great ,and the singer is perfect for this band.Futher world is the best song on it but rodeo,and loud and proud are also good .And in a way they sound a little bit like ed guy that progressive band that is real good also.Buy this cd it rocks."
2,One of my least favorite Naxos disks.,"I am a big fan of Naxos. This is probably my least favorite cd. Its choral pieces seem more like opera and out of character with other cds in this line (such as Sanctus, Agnus Dei). But at ($) or less, you can't complain too much. Recommendation: listen to a few tracks to see if you like this style before you buy."
4,Nice,"I got this book within two days, exactly when I needed it. It arrived on time and in good packaging. I would like to thank el felix for sending the book. I am anxious to use it."
5,"ESTA CHIDO EL DISCO,SOBRE TODO LA CANCION DESPUES DE AMARLE","I HAD NEVER HEARD DESPUES DE AMARLE BEFORE UNTIL HE SANG THIS SONG ON BIG BROTHER, PRIMER TONTO ITS ANOTHER GREAT SONG, I LIKE THE WAY HE SINGS IT, YOU SHOULD ALSO HEAR CALLADOS, FEATURING NINEL CONDE HIS GIRLFRIEND, ALSO FROM BIG BROTHER VIP MEXICO."
5,esta buena,"despues de que mire a jose manuel en cristan canto la cancion ''sin sal ni limo"" me gusto mucho por que fue lo que me estaba pasando en ese tiempo con mi ex novio y sea me ayaudar mucho a vivr sin el."
5,Great Live Album,If you have ever seen Carrie in person you know that she is a great live performer. There are just some nuances that are missed in the studio version of a song. Carrie has a great way of making you feel how personal some of these songs are for her in her live performances. This is absolutely an album to add to your Carrie collection!
2,Disappointing,"My first experience with Jeremy Pelt was listening to Haiku (from Identity). A great song on an impressive CD. Close to My Heart disappoints because of the five overly orchestrated simply awful songs on the CD. The other five are good solid pieces. So unless you are into mush, bypass this one."
1,Never Hits It,"When players like Pelt are getting praise - there's too much hype over ""young lions"". This guy never quite hits it..."
4,Wonderful shape,"The only reason I didn't give 5 stars, they are a little bit big for cereal, but I still love the quality, the shape and style. They are very handy, look great, and I just love the entire set. The soup bowls just don't cut it for cereal bowls, which is why I bought these, and am pretty happy I did."
4,versatile bowls,"I ordered these bowls to augment my Mikasa Antique white dishes. They are great cereal dishes, or use for pasta, stew, or another kind of dish. They stack well in the cupboard, fit easily into the dishwasher and are lightweight but sturdy. This pattern of dishes is the most versatile I have ever owned."
2,4 of 8 bowls chipped in less than 1 yr,"We bought a set of the Mikasa Antique White Dinnerware and have been really impressed by it. The dishes are pretty, sturdy and dishwasher safe. Because the set only comes with the pasta bowls, I ordered a set of eight of the cereal bowls. While the dinnerware set is still perfectly intact, half of the cereal bowls are chipped already. I am surprised that there is such a difference between the quality of the dinnerware and the bowls. I would not recommend the cereal bowls at all."
3,Big honkin' bowls!,"I love my dishes and wanted to add these on as cereal bowls, since the set came with shallow bowls, better suited as salad plates, really. So, I ordered these. The other reviews said the were large, but that is kind of relative, so I thought they would be ok. Well, they aren't cereal bowls unless you are Jethro Bodine. They hold 3 1/2 cups, or about 28 ounces. My idea of ""cereal bowls"" hold 1 3/4 cups or 14 ounces. So, these are about twice as big as a ""normal"" cereal bowl. Knowing the exact measurement will be helpful for you since these bowls qualify as HUGE (in my book, anyway)but you can decide for yourself, based on measurement. They are pretty and I use them for other things, but I still don't have cereal bowls."
5,Good bowls,"Enjoying soups in these over sized bowls! Although not an easy fit in the dishwasher, we like them very much. Out of things to say, do not have 20 words on a bowl"
4,Wish I had gotten these instead.,The Antique White has two different table settings available. One with the rimmed soup bowls and a standard cup and saucer. That's the one I got because I didn't know any better and the sales person at Macy's either didn't know or care that the set I would have preferred had I known about it would have been the set that came with the cereal bowls and the Cappuccino mugs. So now I have both sets of bowls. Anybody want some cups and saucers?
5,Cereal bowls,The cereal bowls are beautiful. My suggestion is that if they can be made less deep. They are two big.Ines Gortazar
1,Dislike,"I bought Inner Grace after smelling it on someone else and loved it, but she told me all the Grace lines smelled good. This one smelled like old rancid perfume or lipstick. It was awful. Inner Grace smells a lot like Sarah Jessica Parker's Lovely, but cheaper, Amazing Graze, it's just bad."
4,"Very nice, just a hair too small!","I was very impressed with the quick ship on this product, but I was under the impression that I would be able to roll the cuff over to get a bit more ear-coverage (I wear this to feed my horses on a cold day, lol!). The cuff is stitched in on the sides of the cap, and there is a very nice ""InuYasha"" embroidered text on the back.Im very impressed with the quality, I just wish it would fit a 22 year old head better!! =)"
4,love it,"Ok I do love it, but the hat is small, so it does not goes far enough down for me, but I love it."
4,Good quality and super cute,"I really like this hat. It is very good quality and adorable, but like some other people have mentioned, I didn't like the cuff either. It is perfect after some minor alterations. That is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I highly recommend this to any Inuyasha fan!"
2,Meguiars Gold Class,I bought this Leather Cleaner for My Ford King Ranch which has some pretty expensive leather seats.I should not have .The cleaner did work however the seats did not seem to have any conditioner at all.I gues I will just have to fork out for the King Ranch conditioner again.
1,worst decision I ever made,"I tried Meguiar's rich leather wipes on my new sports car and over the course of a single day, it turned my black leather seats to slightly greenish brown leather seats. It claims to protect from UV rays, but instead it destroyed my leather seats. They should add a warning that this could happen."
3,It works....kinda.,"I used the blue color cure wax with chip stick. Surprisingly, the chip stick did do the trick on some of the smaller scratches and paint nicks, but some of the larger scratches remained unhidden. The key to using the chip stick is to use it when your vehicle is hot, such as in the direct sunlight (the opposite of what you should do with the liquid wax). The chip stick melts into your scratches and with a light buffing blends nicely into the paint surface. I was a bit disappointed with the wax itself. The ""one-color-fits-all"" is quite misleading. My vehicle is a dark shade of blue. The blue wax is a medium shade (at best). The lighter blue did not match well with my vehicles paint and now I have the small scratches (in which the wax remained) that show up as light blue. I'm considering an experiment, buying the black color cure wax and mixing the two until the wax color more closely matches my vehicle's color."
2,Hard to appreciate the value,"I have The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934) in a DVD set together with The 39 Steps, Sabotage, and The Lady Vanishes. Maybe it's the quality of the reproduction itself, but I found it difficult to truly enjoy the film.Much of the dialogue is unclear, and there are spots where words and phrases are missing, probably absent from the master used itself. On first viewing I had trouble distinguishing some of the male characters. Maybe if I watch it again, the difference will become clear.Some reviewers feel that this 1934 version is better than the one from 1956. From my experience, it is the other way around. Two stars for 1934 and four or five stars for 1956. I really felt the suspension and tension in that one. If I saw a better reproduction of 1934, would I change my mind? I am open to that, if I have the opportunity."
3,Very Barlow-ish,"The author of this program, Patrick Barlow, is famous for writing radio plays in which he gets the history of the subject - whether it's art, Shakespeare, the Messiah or the Greatest story ever told, terribly, terribly wrong. He has certain ""schticks"" which he puts into all of his writing. It works well when he's doing a comedy, less well when he's doing a drama with comedic elements, such as this. (The young Van Gogh meets his very first landlady. He's wearing a top hat. The landlady looks at it and says, ""What a marvelous hat."" That's pure Barlow.)"
4,Paradoxes from a Straightforward Guy,"For all the blather about leadership, the thousands of books, videos and tapes available, there is something missing -- an acknowledgement that the ways to great leadership aren't clear. Charles Edmunson has recognized that leadership is not a clear-cut, cookie-cutter makeover, but a personal examination, and an understanding that leadership in today's world is an amalgam of paradoxes. This short, but rich book asks readers to discover themselves in a world of paradoxes-- where we have more influence when we listen, when we are stronger when we are vulnerable, when grace is stronger than confrontation. Anyone struggling with the leadership of an organization will benefit from this short read, but beware: if you want a one-minute formula, you won't get it here. What you'll get is the opportunity for honest self-examination, and some tough questions that if answered from the heart, will benefit you and your team."
5,Looking for miracles - A great video for everyone!!!!,"This is a heartwarming tale of two brothers who become great friends over the period of a summer. 18 year old Ryan, fresh out of high school takes on a summer job as a camp counselor for kids, to help pay for his college education. His mother, who works all the time and can't afford a babysitter, insists that Ryan must take his brother to camp if he wants to go. Needless to say, the two have quite a few adventures at camp and get to know each other better and by the summer's end, they have become great friends. This video is a timeless classic that you will want to watch over and over again. Although it isn't being produced anymore, I would recommend buying a used one from an auction if you get the chance. This is one video you don't want to miss!!!"
3,Ad not clear,Killdirt advertised this as a 2pack. When I received the order there was only one filter. The advertisement was not clear. My understanding of a 2pk means there should be two filters.
5,Truly Poetry for All Seasons,"This is one of the most beautiful books of poetry I've ever read, and I've read a lot of poetry collections working in an elementary school library. Children of all ages appreciate these poems, many of them haiku, by Japanese masters of the art of brief imagery. If your kids think poetry isn't really poetry unless it rhymes, share this book with them. Demi's incredibly lovely paintings enhance the beauty and idea of each poem. This sweet book inspires kids to try writing their own poetry."
2,Super Reader,"Condorman was a movie where Disney tried and failed to do a spoof properly. Neither good enough for kids or adults, the book suffers because of that, and having to be kid accessible.A cartoonist gets involved with spies and a silly spy plot by virtue of a friend, and ends up bringing one of his own outlandish characters to life."
1,Never Again!,"Imagine having 45 elementary students that think they are going to get to watch The Lorax for Dr. Seuss's birthday. Imagine that with no internet access. I may have been ignorant to not realize that I wouldn't also get the actual DVD, but Warner Bros. is ignorant to assume that everyone in the country is prepared for this type of technology. I will never purchase from Warner Bros. again!"
1,"ultraviolet digital copy, no thanks.","Bring back the regular digital copies. I refuse categorically to buy anything with an ultraviolet digital copy. Using Flixter to stream a digital copy is terrible strategy. Unless it can be copied onto my devices, I don't want it. When the streaming servers go dark, and they will go dark, you will be left with nothing.<edit>The movie itself is great. It is a wonderful adaptation of the book. The music is dated, having a hokey 70s sound to it.However, the product itself - a blu ray movie with an ultraviolet digital copy is flawed. I imagine the actual blu ray and/or DVD will be great. 4+1/2 stars for the movie itself.I hope the manufacturers will take note that they are losing sales to inferior digital copies.</edit>"
1,This is not the 2012 version,I ordered this movie thinking it to be 2012 movie. The seller is not telling that this is 1972 version remake. This is not the 2012 version. I am returning it back. I don't want to pay $15 for a 1972 remake of the Lorax.
4,Children's story with an ecology lesson,"When I ordered this, I thought it was the new movie. It was not. But I like it better than the newly released version. This one has a simplicity and clarity that every child 4 or older can understand. Wonderful lesson about what happens when we destroy our environment."
1,Not the Lorax we saw in theaters,So disappointed! I had no idea that a version from the 70's woud be on Blu Ray! Kids were so sad we when sat down to watch this as a family last night!!! Useless waste of money!
1,They ruined it with ultra violet,"Nothing against the movie. The Lorax is a great story and this cinematic version is a classic. However, this rating is based solely on this item which is a copy with ultraviolet. We aren't rating the movie, we are rating the object being sold. Ultraviolet is not a true digital copy. If people are ignorantly buying this thinking they are really getting a digital copy, think again. Force them to stop producing disk sets with ultra violet by not buying it!"
2,The Lorax,"I wasn't happy with my purchase---I didn't realize it was the old Lorax, I thought it was the new remake."
5,Great classic!,I used this as a lesson in my class and they enjoyed it a lot. Especially since the new version wasn't out yet.
5,Cute movie - NOT the one out in the theaters at present,"This movie follows the story in the original Lorax story written by Dr. Seuss. Really cute, but don't confuse it with the movie that is out now in theaters. I will buy that video when it is released. I wanted the kids to see both versions. The service was great and I received the movie very fast."
1,BEWARE,"THIS IS NOT THE 2012 MOVIE. I don't know why this edition is listed as 2012, or is exactly the same length as the Danny DeVito movie, or lacks any description other than the title. It is an old movie of very poor quality and is not worth your time, money, or that sickening feeling you will get while watching it. The short from 1978 is available for free online and is worthwhile; avoid this product! I would give it negative stars if only such a thing were possible."
1,a waste of money!,not at all what I thought it would be. I wish I had recourse to get my $ back! buy the book!
4,"The Young Ones Meets Yes, Prime Minister","If you are a fan of Rik Mayal from the Young Ones, or of the Yes (Prime) Minister series, you have to get this. Mayal stars as Alan B'Stard, new Member of Parliament who has every trick up his sleeve. Nothing is too dirty or sneaky for him as he pulls out all the stops to work his way up ""the slippery pole"" (Note: that's a British term meaning to work your way up the politcal ranks to Prime Minister). Not as clever as Yes, Prime Minister, but brilliant in another avenue. B'Stard is as sneaky, cynical, and conniving a character as I can think of. Watch him as he uses his election to the European Communion to get free translations of his Dutch ..., or him squeezing lemon into his eyes to produce the proper sob story effect to get an environmentalist on his side - whereupon after the legislation is passed for the UK to buy up land for a nature preserve it is found out he just bought a strip of land that runs directly through it all."
5,Wow!,"After hearing these guys on Weekend Edition I rushed out to the store and grabbed this. It's one of the most exciting discs I've heard all year. They were saying on the interview that they're not like Kronos - and they're not! They've got so much soul, spirit, and energy - the sounds on this disc range from blues and jazz-influenced to more ""classically"" oriented pieces that show off their chops. Don't miss this one!"
2,Picture is wrong; Not covered tip,"The photo that Amazon uses is wrong. On these bulbs, the tip is not covered/painted. Thus, you cannot use these in a fog or low beam application where the factory does not use a separate shield in front of the bulb to prevent oncoming glare.It is, however, suitable for driving or high beam applications, but then just get the Philips product which, at the time of this writing, is much cheaper and higher quality. See http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00480KOP4/"
3,underwhelming,"A decent stock replacement bulb, but it doesn't impress with its brightness. If simply looking to replace a burnt out bulb, this is a good choice."
3,"""NOT ALL THAT GREAT""","I understand this is Richard Barre's first book. He did far better than I could do. Wil Hardesty is introduced as a PI. There are seven children found in graves after a flash flood. The father of one of the seven hires Wil to find out who killed his son. Seems as people close to Wil either get killed or hurt. I really liked the first 179 pages (paperpack) after that the book seemed to really drag until the last 10-15 pages. If you read it you can see what happened on page 179. I don't want ot say as it would take away from the story. There was a lot of talk and more talk after that. The book does end well but it was a long read, nearly but it down several times."
2,Depressing,"I gave this book 66 pages and finally put it back on the shelf. The writing style seems a little choppy, and the locale lingo doesn't make sense if you're not familiar with that area. Most importantly though, there are just too many dead children. The hero, Wil, lost his 11 yr old son, the man who hires him lost his 6 yr old son and the story line revolves around the death of 7 children. Yuck."
3,Not quite what I was looking for,"I got this video because I was looking for an instructional video that would give step-by-step instructions how to do oral and anal sex between men. This is much more like a sex education video for high-schoolers. It gives general advice on dating, sex, and relationships. It talks about safe sex a lot. It doesn't give step-by-step instructions. It shows some masturbation and oral sex, but not much, and it doesn't explain how to do it.Also, the video is dated. Some of the sex information about STD prevention I expect is outdated."
4,Written with Much Rhyme and Reason,"My youngest daughter - in college - seems very well pleased with this selection... like the professor gave her a choice, right?"
2,Not more than barely passable,"I saw this movie only a couple of days ago, and already I hardly remember it. It's just not very good. The production values are quite fine, and so are some of the performances. But the main character is somewhat aggravating, and the plot goes nowhere. I was glad to see it end.It's hard to see what point this movie is trying to make. In a way, I guess it's attempting to update and incorporate some elements of the 1956 movie ""Tea and Sympathy,"" where a straight man is mistaken for gay. But now, nearly half a century later, it's time to move on, isn't it?"
1,"not good, not plausible, not interesting","This is a French-Canadian film, badly dubbed into English. I watched with the English subtitles on, and what the characters said rarely matched what the subtitles thought they were saying. Very bad paraphrasing of almost every sentence uttered.As far as the actors go, not very good. The guys are young and attractive since they float around in a world of modeling, stripping, and porn. They might be pretty, but they're not very good actors. The nudity is minimal. I didn't buy any of the father-son scenes at all. It seemed to me that some scenes must have been cut. A whole subplot about the visiting cousin needed to be fleshed out.This is not gay enough to be gay. And it's not straight enough to be straight. And it's certainly not good enough to be good. It's just dull and pointless."
1,Why?,I thought this movie was very disjointed. It didn't do a very good job of connecting the scenes. The cinematography was excellent. But that couldn't save this movie from been very uninteresting.
4,Salvation brings Alphaville back to their style,"Salvation hits the right beats and sends you back to when no one knew of Alphaville and you felt you that the music was made just for you. This is a must have if you already own ""Forever Young"" and ""Afternoons In Utopia"". If you dont know who Alphaville is then this is an excellent cd to start with. One thing to do is get the American release with the extra tracks. The European one doesn't have any extra tracks and has a different cover. You will enjoy this cd!"
2,Alphaville makes a foray into techno-blandness,"Sorry I have to disagree with the other reviewers. I was a big fan of Alphaville in the 80's, but this one is full of empty euro-dance fluff that may get your feet moving but the melodies and chord progressions are absolutely commonplace. A guardian angel theme runs the course of this album, making it a concept album I suppose, and even this becomes tiresome. Also gone are the cryptic lyrics full of wild imagery that made Alphaville so unusual (though I suspect a lot of it was nonsense stemming from an awkward grasp of the English language at the time). I have yet to buy Prostitute, but my hopes are up on that one."
4,"Like Wolfgang Loos, Like Salvation","Alphaville has successfully (IMHO) updated to the new millenium with this adventure into dance/techno. Wolfgang's voice is as strong as always, though the lyrics are not as interesting as Afternoons in Utopia."
5,Fantastic synthpop,"I am a very new fan to Alphaville. I recently bought a copy of Salvation via Metropolis Records when they had their summer sale. I had heard some of their songs on youtube and had to buy the album. I have been listening to the album a lot. Since I have been listening to a lot of synthpop lately, Salvation was definitely an album I could sink my teeth into. The songs are upbeat and loaded with catchy pop hooks. What more can anyone ask for with this type of music? I really love Marian Gold's vocals. His vocals has a sweet, melancholy quality to it, kinda like in the vein of Pet Shop Boys and Erasure. I love all the tracks on the album. Salvation is just a really charming synthpop album. The music does not sound dated at all for me. I am definitely going to have to check out the group's other albums. I am definitely a converted fan."
3,"PRETTY GIRLS, PRETTY VAPID, PRETTY TAME","Not racy, spicy, revealing in any sense. Unless you wantto make a case for the Dumb Blonde Syndrome. (I'm fromMinnesota; plenty of blonde's there; all genius's comparedto these play mates.)Actually, kinda tame/lame and sad; destroys alota illusions."
2,Only if your a fan or the Cartoon Network.,"Only if your a fan or the Cartoon Network, will this game be a must buy.Don't waste your money on this game, or your time. This game is fun for younger kids under 7 maybe. The levels are limited to movements, and the graphics are odd. My son (10yr.) had this game finished in a few hours time. This game can't even hold a candle to Mario's racing games."
1,Not worth it,"I bought this product but not worth it, still deer are coming to my yard and eating plant. So not worth it to spend this much amount"
2,Too expensive,"Tried this product for deer,as directed for 2 months. It works great the first day, Everything leaves the area. You then have to reapply in 3 days, and then 2 weeks. By that time the container is empty. In less than two weeks the deer are back. I bought the 3 lb size thinking it would last longer. Getting one month (or less) for $27 is too expensive for me."
1,stray away,I heard this works for stray cats. Has anyone tried the product to keep unwanted cats out of the yard? I can't afford a fence as my yard is rather big. Help?
4,COYOTE PURINE,"While I lived in Spain, I worked on a ranch that had many Prarie dogs. I don't mind them but the owner had a bunch of lazy cow stock so he had me try to get rid of them. I tried traps and safe baits, then I relocated them or shipped them off to relatives who wanted to adopt them.COYOTE URINE works sometimes if you spray it around the hole but some clever Prarie dogs never see the COYOTE after months so they know they've been had and stay.This Repellent comes in Granules, so you can just toss them around a garden. It's costly. If you know your wildlife, it's cheaper to use donor Coyotes to provide you with their COYOTE URINE."
1,Coyote Urine,Product didn't work as advertised. It was expensive and a waste of money. I wouldn't buy it again I felt ripped off.
1,"This didn't work for us, but a lamp did","This product seemed to work for one night with our raccoon that adopted our backyard as its poop station. Used it all up over the next few nights but never got any further results. Instead we placed a lamp to shine a light on the area most used by the raccoon - which was an area that was very dark at night. It worked immediately, and the raccoon has never returned (months later)."
4,Great customer service at Shake Away!,These people really stand behind their product! I had some doubts and some questions. They were prompt and courteous to help me.I recommend that you give their product a try. They stand behind their guarantee and are very eager to please. I only have good things to say about them.
1,"Worthless, Don't waste your money....","I had a problem with 10 raccoons before I used this product, now I have a problem with 14. The product seems to attract raccoons"
4,Works great so far,"Arrived quickly, apparently works well as I have not seen any evidence of deer since applying it per the instructions. My two dogs were very definitely interested in it at first but are okay with it now. Will use again."
2,Think twice B/4 U try this!!,"Although this is my first experience usingthis product, I didn't like it very much!!It gave me alittle energy, but I onlylost 3lbs in 2 wks. By mid afternoon Iwas really hungry and wanted more thanwhat I should actually eat. Will not tryagain!"
5,stayed sharp,"I had to drill 10 holes about 4 1/2 inches deep in concrete. To my supprise, it stayed sharp. I intend to drill another 10 holes later. I am well satisfied."
4,Acoustic??,I had to redo the original review below which I gave 2 stars to 4 stars. After listening to this a few more times I grew to appreciate it. Long time fan.Can't get a grip on this one. As a fan I found the odd acoustic version to be hard to listen to. Living Proof sounds completely different to the original in a bad way. Save your money.
4,ALPHA DVD VERSION,"BLACK RAVEN IS A TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE OF A POVERTY ROW OLD DARK HOUSE MURDER MYSTERY. STORMY NIGHT, WASHED-OUT BRIDGE, WEIRD ASSORTMENT OF ODDBALL CHARACTERS WITH SHADY PASTS, SPOOKY WAYSIDE INN, SECRETS TO HIDE, AND THEN THE MURDERS BEGIN...EVERYONE IS A POTENTIAL SUSPECT OR VICTIM.GEORGE ZUCCO IS A MASTER AT THIS KIND OF STUFF & IS GREAT TO WATCH AS ALWAYS, SECOND ONLY TO LUGOSI FOR SHEER ENTERTAINMENT VALUE IN THE LAND OF PRC/MONOGRAM. A MUST HAVE FOR FANS OF THE GENRE!!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.HOWEVER,....THE ALPHA DVD VERSION COMES FROM NOT THE GREATEST SOURCE MATERIAL. THE PRINT IS RATHER DARK MAKING IT HARD TO SEE WHAT EXACTLY IS GOING ON IN SOME SCENES & THAT'S WHY I KNOCK OFF A STAR IN THE OVERALL RATING OF WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE A MUST FOR ZUCCO FANS."
4,Better than average offering from PRC...,"The 1943 PRC effort ""The Black Raven"" is an interesting mix of ""old dark house"" stories and a slight dash of film noir.George Zucco is great as Amos Bradford, the owner of The Black Raven Inn, a stopover on the edge of the Canadian border. Bradford is also known to the underworld as a contact man who can help crooks escape across the border to safety. Add a thunderstorm, several crooks, a pair of young lovers, a timid banker, and a bumbling handyman to the mix, and the stage is set for murder, mystery, and mayhem.Serial fans will want to keep and eye out for the Sheriff, played by Charles Middleton. Middleton is probably best known to fans as Ming the Merciless in the Flash Gordon serials."
3,Are these really Easy Spirit's?,"I have owned 2 other pairs of Easy Spirit walking shoes in the past and they are extremely comfortable and well made. These Jumpstep's by Easy Spirit must be part of their budget line(did these really sell for over $70?). Problems: Not much arch support. Very narrow fitting shoe and I have feet that are between narrow and medium width. Nowhere inside the shoes does it state if these are leather upper,only that they are made in China. A comparable shoe can be found at W@lM@rt. As for how they feel while walking,etc., time will tell and I will post later about that."
3,A Field guide to Atlantic Coast Fishes,We were disappointed in this particular guide. We have Peterson bird guides that are great but the fishes guide is mostly black and white images and many varieties of fish had no image at all. Written information was available for all species.
3,A Field guide for large fish only,"This is a field Identification book, If you really want to know what you caught, you need better literature. When you catch smaller fish species, many of the key features listed for them do not pertain to your catch. That, and the book is built to fall apart, with the plates in the center of the book struggling to freedom within a year."
1,why was it wet with pages torn out?,"well the title says it all. it was soaked when it came in the mail and a few pages were ripped out. it was not tampered with post shipping. thats just how it came in the box, on a sunny day."
4,Unexpected love and coming out story,"""Man I love"" is a well made piece of french cinema. It's a story about friendship, which change gradually into love, about coming to terms with own sexuality and about dying...Both Jean Michel Portal and Marcial Di Fonzo Bo, as well as the rest of the cast, deliver outstanding performances.The director, without unnecessary drama, dealt with problem of AIDS and its impact on people's lives.There are, however, some plots and scenes, which are bit unclear. The first I have in mind, is the one where Martin gets fired.Another one is the scene in the pool, kind of dreamy one, with flowers and young boy swimming by Lucas. What does it stand for?These few missteps won't change my opinion about this film. It's worth to see. I am still waiting for european release :(P.S. The cover of the dvd...Only Americans could create such kitchy thing. Don't let you misslead with this little graphic disaster. It has really nothing to do with the content inside."
1,Simply Awful,"The box cover and desription of this make this flick seem sexy and edgy. It is actually boring, depressing, and almost completely reprehensible. The moral of the story is that straight men can be persuaded to pity gay men enough to sleep with them (but only if they have AIDS and are dying). I was insulted by this film. Save yourself time and agravation--skip this one!"
4,Maybe it's because I'm half-French,"I've read some of the other reviews but I can't agree with the negative ones, perhaps, because I think you really have to understand French culture and our ways.I really thought this movie was great. Yes, fine, there was no literal reason for Lucas to fall for Martin, but that is normal in a French movie, but if you are French, you'd understand.Having said that, it really is about Lucas learning to finally love, and he chose Martin, even though, at times Martin was a bit much and mean towards him. Again, in French culture, it all makes sense.So all I have to say is that this is a very romantic film, if you understand the culture, if you don't, then yes, it could seem like crap because they didn't have a big Hollywood ending, like you were looking for."
1,The 39 Steps,"This take of the original novel is fairly decent, however there is much better version available. In 1979 a Brittish film company produced a color version of the original story, which I think is outstanding. Though extremely hard to find, spend the extra time to locate the '79 Brittish version of the 39 Steps. It is much more accurate and suspenseful, compared to the Hitchcock versions. Quite frankly, don't waste your time watching Hitchcock's movie."
5,Excellent introduction for middle school,"I second ""historian0""'s review, and I have to add that the numerous first person accounts from letters and interviews make this an excellent choice for a logic-staged child studying this time period. My 6th and 8th graders will be reading this to get an understanding of how their lives would have been ordered if they were born into Hitler's Germany."
3,THRASH REVISTED,"ON THE CUSP OF THE THRASH METAL REBIRTH ASSASSIN AND DESTRUCTOR ARE PUTTING OUT ALBUMS LIKE 15 TO 20 YRS AFTER THERE LAST RELEASES.I WAS HESITANT TO PURSCHASE DUE TO A COUPLE OF NEGATIVE COMMENTS FROM MY FRIENDS, BUT I TOOK A CHANCE AND I ACTUALLY ENJOYED THE CD IT SOUNDS GOOD AND THERE ARE THE TYPICAL THRASH RIFFSTHE COVER OF THIN LIZZYS ""THUNDER AND LIGHTNING "" WAS DONE REALLY WELL"
1,Absolutely useless,"I bought this unit over the cheaper io|2 express because it looked better quality in the pictures, and had better reviews. I now realize the io|2 express is the updated model of the same device and comes with a more recent version of cubase and better compatibility. I was completely unable to get the io|2 to work at all (windows 7 x64), so returned the device to amazon. Subsequently bought the io2 express and have had no problems with it."
2,Battery won't hold charge,"Was very excited to get this product at such an incredible deal. Had been having trouble with my original Motorola battery because it wouldn't hold a charge. Was very disappointed to discover that the new one doesn't either. After about an hour's conversation the battery was nearly dead. Oh well, at least now I have two!"
1,Terrible book,"This is a terrible book. I've never been in war, but it doesn't seem realistic at all. Terribly written. Atleast its a fast read so you won't waste to much time if you decide to read it."
4,The soldiers that died at Vietnam,"I think everyone who likes action and war novels or stories should read this book. When Lieutenant Carrol was killed, I was amazed because he is the leader and suppose to be protected, but was hit by a stray bullet in the shoulder. If anyone likes war stories and action you most definitely read this book. I recommended this book to anyone over 11 years old. Enjoy the book!"
5,i cound not put it down at all,I am a 13 year old boy who hates reading. i read this book and i could ont put it down for one second. the book is unbelveable
5,The most compelling book wrote,I think that the way Myers write the book is so real and compelling that you feel as though you are in Vietnam. This is the best book i have read and recomend it to any one.
5,Powerful book - feels like you are there with them,It's about Perry going to off to war. He struggles with the people around him and the war itself. You get the feel like you're in the war yourself. An excellent book to read.
4,Fallen Angles,This book is a very good war book. There is alot of action in this book. It is about a guy named Perry and he goes to the war. He also makes friend with people that are trying to get out of the war. It will be the best war book you ever read. It also has other things you will like. You shold read this book it is very exciting.
5,CAN'T PUT THIS BOOK DOWN,"GOT THIS BOOK FOR MY 14 YEAR OLD SON (SUMMER READING). VERY ATHLETIC BUT HE LIKES TO READ ON DAYS WITH NOTHING TO DO. HE READ ""FALLEN ANGELS"" AND COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN. BASEBALL AND BASKETBALL TOOK A BACKSEAT TO THIS BOOK NOT VICE-VERSA!!! HE WANTS MORE BOOKS LIKE THIS!!! HOORAY!!"
5,Stellar. A must-read for any 18-year-old,"As one of the greatest books I have ever read, Fallen Angels is breathtaking. The descriptions in this book have made the Vietnam War clear to me--In its carnage and brutality. I have four chapters left and I have never been so affected by a novel in my entire life. I feel as though I have seen the battles of the war firsthand. The descriptions have etched themselves into my mind without traumatizing me to the extent that the brave young men and women who fought the war had been. The scariest part about it is, I am the same age as some of the men in the story--I would never have survived."
