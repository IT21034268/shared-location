2,"No slide, no right or left click",They never described it as a mouse without a right or left click or the center slide.Useless for me.
2,Really rough shape,"As advertised, the condition of the coin will vary. Mine, for example is in really rough shape. You can read the date, but everything above that is worn and faded to the point that it's hard to tell it even was a walking liberty."
2,"Nice bag, poor quality","This rolling bag is the perfect size for the traveling professional. However, the quality is poor. After only one business trip, a rivet holding the wheel assembly to the bag broke. The bag was not over-loaded; I merely had my laptop and a few folders inside for the trip. I quickly returned the unit to Amazon which they processed quickly and accurately. I purchased a Samsonite rolling laptop bag that is working great."
5,Cute and reasonably durable,"This is a cute little plastic highchair. It is made from a strong attractive plastic, unlike a lot of other plastic toys, so it fits right in with her painted wood kitchen. It went together easily enough. I prefer it in the traditional high chair position. It's a little smaller than I thought it would be, but it still fits her baby Chou Chou and soft baby Stella. I'd recommend it for ages 4 and up."
4,"Cute, not sturdy","I can't comment on the assembly of this item, since Santa assembled it while Daddy was a bit busy.This thing is small... very small. You should know that by the dimensions, but it doesn't really make the impression until you see it. It is the perfect height for my daughter, and is proportioned properly for the doll that goes in it, but it's so... small.Anyway, the only real comment here is that she loves it, but it is constantly being knocked over by my son when he walks by it a little too briskly... or he does it on purpose, I don't know.Sometimes, when she ""feeds"" the baby, she knocks it over as well.It is made of plastic and very light - good for moving around the house, but bad for keeping it upright.Still, she loves it and plays with it, pretending to be a Mommy. It makes her happy, which is its purpose."
4,Great baby accessory,"We've had this toy for a few months now and both my kids are still playing with it on an almost daily basis. Definitely a good buy. My daughter who is now 4 still just loves playing momma and this was a perfect addition to her little pretend nursery. Now my 2 year old son gets in on the action, it's too cute too watch."
5,Very nice high chair,This high chair is very pretty and fits our daughter's dolls nicely. It's a perfect size for our 22 month-old daughter. It doesn't look cheap like many other ones I've seen and it was easy to put together. What more could you want? This chair also converts into a desk and chair set but I don't think we'll ever do that -- it's probably always going to just be a high chair.
3,"Different, but Good Taste","There are to things I really like to snack on and that's, Jerky and Spicy Stuff. Believe it or not, these beef stick's have a little spice to them(not a lingering spicy).The reason I gave these a 3 of 5 STARS, is because I make my own Beef and Deer Jerky and although these Jalapeno and Cheese are something different and tasty, they come nowhere close to my awsome homemade jerky made from steak, not ground beef part's such as (beefheart)."
1,Disgusting!,I didn't care for these. It tastes like old salty ham and that horrible clove oil used for tooth aches. It's disgusting. I couldnt even eat it past half way. I actually had to get up and brush my teeth.
2,Not what I expected -- sort of gross!,"These beef sticks taste very odd, and I'm not sure how to describe it. They're super-oily, which is gross, and the jalapeno/cheese ones have a lot of spice, which is okay. They just taste strange and have a weird texture. Try Ostrim beef sticks instead, they are far superior!"
2,"Heavy on the Pepper, Light on the Roni","These sticks are not what I expected. I like the fact that they don't contain MSG, but they are quite spicy to be ""pepperoni flavored"", and I really don't detect anything that tastes like pepperoni. It would be more accurate to simply call them ""pepper flavored beef sticks"". As 'pepper flavored beef sticks', I give them a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10. I don't care for the texture (kind of mushy), and they have a little bit of a greasy flavor to them, as well."
2,Like So Much of the Jewelry Amazon Sells,"I don't know why I buy these things. I guess it's Lightning Deal anxiety.It is pretty much like it appears in the pictures. But up close it has a cheap, mass produced look to it. It's smaller than it appears, and if you saw it a flea market you might think it costs less than $5.I kept it, but wouldn't give it as a gift to someone I cared about.I'm somewhat disappointed with this purchase, even at the reduced Lightning Deal price I paid."
3,Very Odd,"I must say, this is one of the strangest books I have ever listened to. I still am not sure what is is about, where it is set, or what the plot is. But you keep listening to it just to see what happens next, just thinking that soon you will figure it out. All I know is that it is about a crazy lady, and her upbringing. You feel sorry for her, and begin to understand how she got that way, but it jumps around so much that you never know for sure what is real and what is not. In the begining you think that it is going to change and soon it will start to make sence, but it never really does until the end."
4,Strange and Mesmerizing,"I am thrilled that the author chose this disjointed narrative for her main character; how else would the voice of a woman living rough in the streets, her mind jumbled from years of abuse and willful neglect, sound?The back and forth movement of time as the plot moves steadily forward, is a little like what an addled brain might do to chronological time, if pressed for explanation.The dialogue is real and the characters fully realized.Strange and mesmerizing, this book is amazing."
1,"Poor writing, confusing story","This book looked like it may have been interesting. The description on the dust jacket sounded promising. In reality, neither was true. the story starts out slow and mixed with emotion, and ends up slower, confusing, and flat out boring. If ever I had to force myself to read a book, this was it. The more detail the author tried to put into the novel, the more I wanted to scream, because how can you add detail to a story that is barely readable in the first place? Definitely on my DO NOT READ list."
2,"completely agree with : S. Calhoun ""rhymeswithorange""","I too was ready to give up on this book, but kept reading out of pure curiosity - where is this going? First half of this book is dark, somewhat confusing and borderline boring. I am glad I kept reading since it did pick up in the second half, but would not read it again and will not keep this book. I felt it was a bit pretentious, and not quite finished. Too many lose ends, too many questions left unanswered. Upon completing this book I was left with `so what' feeling. Why am I interested in this woman's life? What so special about her? The answer is `nothing'. I think this could have been a great book - the plot is there. But the story did not pick it up. Sorry. Unsatisfying."
5,Double Dose of Ella,"This album contains live tracks from two 1958 JATP concerts recorded a few weeks apart. Originally released on LP, it had a Chicago concert on one side and a Los Angeles concert on the other. Many of the same tunes are repeated, and it is interesting to hear how Ella sang in concert night after night. As per usual, Ella ends her set with an extended scat (Stompin' at the Savoy). In the LA concert, however, we get to hear an encore number -- Lady Be Good -- which is the highlight of the album. This is an excellent CD for both the casual and avid fan."
5,Great read for Perspective,I am using this in 4th grade to teach growth in perspective. I think this is a nice compliment to The Sign of the Beaver.
4,Incorrect description by Amazon,"When I ordered this ladder, I was expecting a fiberglass ladder as per the description by Amazon. When it arrived however, it was steel and heavier than expected. It is quite solidly constructed. To Amazon's credit, they gave me a 20% refund on the price of the ladder. Also, I ordered the platform that was recommended but upon receipt, it will only fit a fiberglass ladder by Werner, not the steel one that I received. I would have thought by now they would have corrected the description."
3,"okay, but could be better","I bought this for my boyfriend. The wallet is good quality, but it's a bit too small. The cash part doesn't hold much cash, once you get mroe than 5 non-crisp bills, it starts to stick out a bit. There is adequate amount of room for credit cards, etc."
4,Excelent Wallet,"The leather is very good, the item itself is good in size. The looks are great. Confortable, not big in size."
1,ARTICULO NO RECIBIDO,LAS 3 CARTERAS NUNCA LLEGARON A SU DESTINO Y FUE DESCONTADO EL PAGO EN MI TARJETA DE CREDITO...FAVOR SOLUCIONAR ESTE PROBLEMA...GRACIAS
3,Not for heavy stuff,"It's made of very light and confortable leather.Does not have coin's pocket; only two card's slots; Euro and new BRL(R$) bills keep border a bit out of It.Very beautiful aspect and nice Tommy flag. The seam was very well done, pretty tight and there are not those glued spaces where you can't reach.Worth the buy if you want a light wallet to not mark your back pocket."
2,Junky and overpriced.,"I payed 19.00 for it, and it doesnt live up to what I thought would be a good wallet. The bills slightly stick out of it-which makes it incredibly annoying. It began to fall apart a week after I got it. When the description says slim-it means slim. It is just to small to fit in my back pocket-I am afraid of it falling out and me not noticing it until the end of the day. Don't bother buying this if you plan on keeping receipts/money in it, it really is useless. Buy a Fossil wallet, their products are quality. Don't waste your time with this thing."
4,slim & perfect !!!,Very thin enough space for cards and currencies (not meant for loads of things).Slim & perfect for me !!!
2,Good recommend you buy,Good recommend you buyGood recommend you buyGood recommend you buyGood recommend you buyGood recommend you buyGood recommend you buyGood recommend you buy There is little
3,It seems lie.,"Al recibir mi billetera quedé muy sorprendido, parece de mentiras, eso no parece cuero real, quedé un poco decepcionado.Upon receiving my wallet was very surprised, think of lies, that does not seem real leather, I was a little disappointed."
2,"video was too short, b",video did cover the highlights of connie francis's career. All in all pretty good video.
4,Great Little Radio,"I've had this unit for nearly a week now and I'm very happy with it so far. I needed a radio on the screened porch and I wanted to mount it under the passthru from the kitchen window. I chose this radio because the depth was only 9 5/8"" which was perfect since I had only 10"" of room. Well, the specs given in the write-up are wrong....the unit is actually 11 1/8"" deep. I guess I can live with the 1"" sticking out since it works so good. The CD player does a great job...just don't look for high quality sound...it's OK, but not all that great."
2,Radio reception is not good,I tried everything to get this radio to pick up stations in our house. I couldn't get it to work so I returned it immediately.
2,Very thin sound,"I was very disappointed with the sound of this player. It has tiny speakers with almost no bass. FM reception is terrible and there is no antenna or any way to hook one up. It does not have any kind of line in or aux input, so the only thing you can listen to are cd's. It won't even play mp3 files on CD, so it is really very limited. I sent mine back and instead bought a pair of powered computer speakers that I can plug my portable mp3 player into."
3,"Great Product, poor quality control from Amazon.com","I bought this radio for my wife. Our old radio broke.. When I got the item shipped from Amazon (it was bought NEW) I could tell the item was previously opened. As it turns out the case was scratched in several places. Since my wife said it was ok, we kept it, but I am VERY unhappy with AMAZON. So much so that I am not going to buy from them anymore. Be careful with what you get from Amazon. They might sell you used merchandise as new...As for the radio, it works well sound is good. It has very little low end range but you cant expect much from the little speakers. (even with bass boost on) It plays burnt CD so that is nice. The radio works and that is a surprise from these types of radios.All in all, a nice radio for a great price."
2,Great product...when it works!,"I've had this unit for less than a year. The radio works wonderfully. The CD player does not work. The unit has a one year warranty, but to get it replaced I have to generate an original receipt and pay non-refundable shipping to SONY. The CD player worked for app. 6 months, then quit. Trying to decide if the unit replacement is worth the hassle. Not pleased."
4,What we were looking for!,"Well, so far, we really like this item! Like another reviewer wrote, there is some static with a few of the radio stations, but I think that can be expected with any radio. (plus, it's not with our fav station, so that's ok!) and the main reason we bought this is for the CD player.We wanted an undercabinet CD player in our kitchen for convenience and this is near perfect. My hubby installed it, so I can't give my feedback on that, but I don't think it was too hard. The speakers are great and there are some nice features to it: changing the clock from regular time to daylight savings is just a push of a button, CD has an auto-shut off if you have it on pause for too long, etc.We got REALLY fast shipping from J&R; too, so that was nice!The only reason for 4 stars is because it's not perfect (as far as the radio static), but it's darn near close!"
3,Poor radio reception,The unit was easily installed and the sound if fair. CD player works all right but the radio reception is terrible on a number of local FM stations that I pick up clear as a bell on my alarm clock radio. Really disappointing.
1,"CD is good, radio stinks.","The radio reception was good for about a month and then went south. No matter where I put this in my home it won't pull in the stations I want. I have two other radios that work fine, so it isn't my location. Definitely look elsewhere."
2,cd ok but radio reception very poor,"My CD523 unit mounted nicely with the help of the template. The radio reception was so-so from the very beginning. Now, some two months later, their is an annoying hiss on our favorite FM station. Other inexpensive radios in the house get good reception for this same station.So, being technologically savvy, I checked the specs online to discover that the FM antenna is in the power cord. My electrical outlet is only about ten inches from the unit; hence, I left the power cord wrapped up and jammed it behind the unit. When I unwrapped it, the reception did improve slightly. The hiss is now subdued. So I'm going to have to live with it.The sound quality is acceptable, yet the bass tones are non-existant. The ""mega-base"" switch is a joke!Wish I had read these reviews in advance and never purchased this unit."
2,not too functional,"I bought this to replace a 15 year GE that had a dying CD player. Overall the GE was much better. The Sony has 15 stations but split in groups of five and by band. On my GE I could program my two favorite AM stations and four FM,s and just scroll through them, now I have to change band and station to get back and forth. Looses clock and station memory when unplugged. no battery back up. No light. Tiny lettering on the radio controls, like they designed it as a CD player control and had an afterthought about how to add the radio controls to the CD buttons.Sounds good if you just want to play CD's. Not much of a clock or radio."
5,Sony ICF-CD523,"A replacement unit for a very reliable GE spacemaker that was used for 20+ years. So far, satisfied. Hope it will last as long as the unit it replaced."
3,Not sure how to rate,Sony ICF-CD523 Under-Cabinet CD Clock RadioNice looking unit. Sound quality is a bit tinny. The am/fm reception is very poor but that could just be my house. It would be nice to be able to attach an external antenna which could easily be hidden inside the cupboard. $70 seems a bit much for tinny sounding CD's but to each his own.
3,What Fidelity,I was very disappointed with the sound quality. Even with the megabass turnedon it didn't seem to make much difference.
2,am review,am signal is almost non existant. People are still listening to AM. I don't know why every product we tried had poor AM reception. Most of my listening is on AM
5,My go to Judge Wig,This wig is ridiculous. That's pretty much what you're going for when you're looking at buying a wig like this. Great for weddings and funerals.
3,Judge's Wig,"This wig sufficed as part of a Halloween costume. The major downside is that it sheds quite a bit. But, for the price, what can you expect?"
2,Readable but very simplistic,"The authors have a good idea, but they really only have an essay's worth of material. The two concepts of predictability and projectability are useful, and should indeed serve as the basis for most decisionmaking, business or otherwise. However, the book as a whole is very light."
2,Disappointing and more Entertaing than Informative,"More entertaining than informative, the content does not live up to the catchy and appealing title. Surprisingly, there is only one reference in the index to risk, a subject at the heart of predictability. References to Nikita Khrushchev, Richard Nixon, Bob Dole and the Rolling Stones add limited substantive value to the book. Chapter One did wet my appetite, but the rest was disappointing. By far the best book on the history, role and need for predictability I have read to date is Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk by Peter Bernstein."
1,Fluff,"This book is full of fluff - lots of words that sound good, but don't really say anything. I read a lot of business and management books - probably 2-3 per month, and have been doing that for years - so out of let's say 200 management books or so I have read, this would be one of the 3 worst."
2,"over-rated book, pompous writing with little content.","Excellent subject. Poor subject exploitation in the book. Written in pompous professor-style which may amuse his students... I consider it a waste of my time. Excellent marketing job on the book, though... chapeau!"
4,The Mouse That Roared,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It was an easy to read, understandable, and unrealistic book. The story of a country only 5 miles wide attacking the U.S. without them even knowing it is very unique compared to some of the other books that I have read. I found it quite interesting when the U.S. citizens believed they were being attacked by aliens from Mars. Overall this book is a great light-reading book and I would recommend it to anyone who is wanting to read something that jokes on governmental systems."
5,One of the best political comedy books ever written,This book is about a duchy only several square miles attempting to get involved in world politics. It decides that the best way for a country to get money is to lose a war with the U.S. It tries to lose a war with the U.S. ... but wins! The story is hillarious and the movie of it is nearly as funny. The Mouse on the Moon is the best of several sequals.
2,wrong cd,I want Ready for boarding from Running Wild and I received Black Metal from Venom. I send it back to the compagny and they give me my money.
1,Too salty,By far the saltiest dry plums I have ever had. I've had plenty of salted dry plums and like them to snack on. but these I cant even keep in my mouth or anything. Maybe use them for cooking or something but I threw out the bags I bought.
1,Worst SSX Title,"The SSX franchise is my most beloved. But this addition to the franchise is by far the least impressive. The graphics are a major step backwards from SSX 3 which was beautiful. You simply cannot create a character that doesn't look like a grungy teenager from 1992. The inability to play our favorite characters in tour mode is unfortunate. But the single most unpleasant aspect of this game and the reason why I dislike it with such passion is that in multiplayer mode if one racer gets too far ahead of another, the player who is behind automatically gets brought forward, catching him up to the player in the lead. This entirely invalidates the very essence of multiplayer."
3,Not as good as TRICKY,SSX Tricky is better than SSX on Tour. If you want a game that the whole family will have fun playing pick SSX Tricky over SSX on Tour.
1,Gun Digest 2002 Nonsense,"The current edition of Gun Digest continues with the same old listings of firearms in the back pages as well as the same pictures. It's a copy of the previous Gun Digest with some minor updates in the catelog pages of firearms and ammunition ballistics, as well as accessories. It's not worth buying if you have last years gun digest. There are perhaps two or three interesting articles but a lot of them are out in left field, wierd, or of the who cares variety. I got swindled even at Amazons cut rate price. Last time I buy one of these ""blivets"" without a personal perusal."
3,Sizes run big!,"I loved this shoe, but it was way too big-almost a whole size too big. I wear a size 5, and have been having a terrible time trying to find a store that carries size 5. So I started shoe shopping online. I was excited to see Dr. Martens on Amazon for such a great price, and in my size! But they were too big, and I had to send them back. I couldn't exchange for a smaller size...they don't make 'em smaller! I had a great experience shopping through Amazon - the shoes arrived quickly, and I had no trouble with the return. Just wish the shoe had fit!"
4,Opening the mind,"This value of this book is the ability to open the mind to who wants to move from a product excellence-based company to a total product lifecycle value-based company; do not expect any magic receipe but only good principles, guidelines, examples and high-level methodologies. Execution is the real challance, to be done not in a one-shot approach but gradually.Top management of most companies should read it."
1,"Why you should keep your faith in religion even ""When Religion Becomes Evil""","The book was very disappointing because it is mostly the author's subjective opinion about the world's religions. The author is very protective of religion in general and does not really hold them responsible for the evil that they inflicted on the world when they misuse their power. Read the first 10 pages and then skip to page 90 and start reading, the author takes that long before he introduces any evidence that religions have ever done anything evil."
3,When religion becomes evil,"I ordered this particular book for my son who questions anything to do with religion & what not,& he really enjoyed it!!"
4,Religion from Another Point of View,"Although I haven't completed the book I Believe everyone should read it. For America we are a Christian nation founded on the principals of a Christian value and morality. Please don't miss understand my point. It doesn't mean our government promotes it. People do have their right to worship as they please. We have a set of laws that have been given to use, not man made. It is based on the oldest recorded writings. Christianity is based on a loving God and therefore judge for yourself. Those who worship a religion outside of Christianity as I see it are invited guest and therefore should adhere to our way of life. If they feel our country is unfair to them, I invite them to leave."
4,To the Point,"Kimball did a good job with this book. Of course due to the topic there is no way he could exhaust this material. His five points are accurate, however I would add FEAR. Humans are inherently afraid. Afraid of the unknown. They crave, seek out religion and a deity to abate some fear.Spirituality is free. religion comes with a cost. a cost of freedom, monetary loss and a loss of indivdualized thinking. Kimball does a good job. Let us cut him slack on not getting it all down. Yes, I agree all religions and individuals who follow,""their"" god are not talking about the same deity. how convenient it would be if that was true.Spirtiuality found me. Religion was forced upon me. Thank God, pun intended, I lost my religion and stayed with my spirtuality.Dan Williams,author of, "" Above His Shoulders."""
3,"Not profound, but not bad","I was required to read this book for school (Senior, College) and got to see Dr. Kimball speak on campus. I was much more impressed with the person than the book. Kimball's position is somewhat vague, and while if you read carefully you can see that he is not against religion per-se, the tone and flow of his writing can give the opposite impression. Worth reading, but only just."
5,Excellent!,"Regarding the book ""When Religion Becomes Evil"" .Religion plays a major role in this world and like most other forces, it can be used for good or evil. Keeping informed helps to keep things in perspective. Vital, given the world situation. Written so an ordinary person is able to understand the subject matter."
2,Very little information; poorly written,"I was expecting to learn something new reading this book. However, I didn't. The material in this book is nothing beyond the most basic information. Plus, and perhaps worse, the book is rather poorly written. There are tons of misspelled words and grammatical mistakes."
3,Some basic information about navigation,"Small book, with basic underwater navigation, good for novice diver"
2,Not Very Detailed,"I wished I had read the reviews for this book before I bought it. This was not the instructional text I was in search of. The text was not very detailed and actually has me searching other text for answers. There were also several misspelled words and grammatical errors, which leave little or no confidence in the authors. I gave the text two stars to at least acknowledge what information I did gather from it."
2,A fine beginner's guide; not an in-depth manual.,"Although this book provides some very useful points in underwater navigation, I found it disappointingly sparse. I was expecting a more substantial study of marine topography and how to apply it to underwater navigation. Instead I got brief explanations of 'Eleven Keys to Natural under water Navigation' (Chapter 1) all of which my dive instructor covered during my open water certification. In all fairness to the authors and their expertise, this is a fine book as a general overview of underwater navigation and compass use, with tips for night and wreck diving. If you're looking for an in-depth manual, as I was, look elsewhere."
4,AND the kitchen sink (but no elves),"Korns has given us the ultimate in fantasty fiction with a complex plot and landscape inhabited by well-developed characters with subtly manifest yet dramatically effective powers eminating from an unusual source--a script, or system of writing. The implication here is profound for fans and writers of this genre alike--writing IS the empowering thing! I also appreciate the purity of this work in that it eliminates all cheesy, marginalizable gimics such as non-human or half-human Yoda-types and goes directly to the gods. As in Greek and other great mythology, it is MEN VS GODS that makes this such a rewarding read. Dense and fast-paced! Witty!"
3,Meh.,"The cards are clearly ""old stock."" The color is not white. They are thin. They work OK, but won't last long if well used. That's about the best I can say."
3,nice HRM but the case breaks,"nice HRM but the case breaksi think they quit making them toothe ears that hold the band on, breaki have had 5 of them so far!no, i am not doing anything special to make them breakon the other hand it is a very good HRMyou can just exercise and later see how much time you spentin 3 separate zonesthe zones are not changeablethey are50-70% max70-8080-upi like that better than having to set 'training zones' like all other HRMSthis one is differenti like the way it works betterif the cases were any goodthey aren;tboth batteries are user replaceablebattery life is goodwle."
5,great text,i am a chemistry grad student now and i used this book in high school. i still think it one of the best gen chem texts I have seen.
2,chemistry and chemical reactivity,This was a preview text. was in good shape but had one sixth of the total number of pages since it was only a preview of the real 4 th editionI could not use it for my requirementI sent it back and waiting for refund. Only under # bucks still.Good experience but not the book i expected.
4,*The* book for color photos/values of Barbies 1981 - 1991,"Anyone who enjoys collecting Barbie & her Friends, especially those dolls which came out during the 1981 to 1991 decade, will love this book. I wanted to find out what Barbies were around when I was a kid in the 80's, and this book was a find! Not only does it include all dolls, gift sets, fashions and other barbie products put out during 1981 - 1991, but also has color photos of each and every product as well as values for each item (NRFB). So if you have been looking for a book which covers this decade of dolls, buy this one now!!"
5,great,It is awesome! I listen to it all the time. Just saw them at Red Rocks and then ordered this CD. I love it
4,Would it have killed the song?,"To sing ""What I am"" instead of ""What I be""? Great music, but damn, we have enough illiterate people in this country..."
2,Everybody Deserves to be Preached At,"Do you really want to be preached at non-stop at while trying to funk?I even agree with some of his political shpeel, but Franti sets himself so far to the left in his neo-hipism, and his obvious self-contradictions are babbled so frequently, that you begin to understand the conservative detestation for short-sighted, college-theory-laden libertarian folk.Franti proves to the listener that everything Franti believes in needs to be rigorously spelled out (even when the rhyme is off-beat) in every line of every cut. That's too bad, because I consider myself mostly sympathetic.Thus is illustrated a classic case of alienating your own kind by being overly preachy. Talking the talk is just too darn easy.As Flavor Flav once said, ""Show us what you got!"", don't keep telling us. We Deserve Music, right?Sorry, but I'm just not hip enough to recommend this heavy load."
2,"No one ""Deserves"" This...","If you have any of Spearhead's albums, go listen to them. A lot. Cry for Michael Franti and his troubled spirit. Pray for him to get angry again, and make music about the world being messed up and wanting to do something about it. Ask your God to light the fire that 9/11 and it's subsequent saber rattling has seemed to extinguish in his heart.If you don't have any Spearhead, start with ""Home"", then ""Listener Supported"", then pick up ""Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy's ""Hipocrisy (Is the Greatest Luxury)"". Then ""Chocolate Supa Highway"". Then listen to the first two songs and the last track on ""Everyone"", and put it away.Hopefully, Franti will do the same thing.""The harder you hit us, the louder we become - just like the skin on a drum"". That should be Spearhead's thesis statement, not this ""one world, one love"" neo-hippie crap."
3,Daschound Training,"Still can't get mine to go outside all the time to potty. He is very stubborn. Hardest dog to train I have ever had! Book is informative, my Dog is not a good student."
2,Oh no!,"Oh no! Why did I buy this? So miserably written I couldn't manage to get through the second chapter. I put it down forever. I'm so sure there's information in this book, but I couldn't decode the language it was written in. Is this English? Miserable. Wordiness out the wazoo. Do people really talk like this? So incredibly verbose that you swear these people just like to prove they can use ""big words"" and as a bonus, hear themselves talk. I only gave it 2 stars because there could be information in it that I just couldn't get to."
4,Pres & Teddy,"Teddy Wilson is a really good jazz pianist. Coupled with Lester Young, and you get music worth listening to."
2,Wet Blanket,"I hate to be the one to dampen the entusiasm for this music --as all the other reviewers seem to be enthralled-- but it's just not the best. You'd think these two would create quiet fireworks, but it just doesn't happen. Even the best musicians have off-days, and I'm afraid this was one of them. Sorry. Buy the CD of Lester Young with Nat King Cole instead."
1,Picture & description deceiving - NO RAG Rack,"I am a faux finisher and needed a place to hang my rags while applying different glazes. The shelf that arrived does not have a built-in rag rack as pictured and described in the Amazon ad. Instead, it has a small indentation for screws. The shelf that was sent can be purchased at Lowe's for under $6.00. Don't waste your money if you are looking for a shelf with a built-in rag rack. I sent this shelf back."
3,"Does NOT fit ""all fiberglass stepladders"" but is a great idea none the less","I bought this product to fit on a ""Rigid"" 6' fiberglass stepladder, 300 lb. rating, that I bought at Home Depot. Under ""features"" the shelf manufacturer claims...""Fits on all fiberglass stepladders and 400 series aluminum""WRONG. This will NOT fit my ladder. The packages instructions state that it will fit all Werner fiberglass ladders. I wish the ad had said that before I bought it. However, to make lemonade out of lemons, I bought some aluminum bar stock and some nuts, bolts and washers and a large bolt and wing nut and did a little measuring and drilling. Now I can install and remove the shelf easily with via one wing nut, but it cannot be closed, and the shelf must be removed to close the ladder.This product is still a great idea and I'd definitely buy it again if I had a ladder it would fit on."
3,"Solid book, excellent photography, worth it.","I think among the many good street photographers shooting with color filmonly a few really succeded. David Harvey is one of the best. It is a nice book, although it could be nicer one with a bit more imaginative photo editing and much crisper design. Nevertheless this is is a good example of the an excellent resources for the photography students, particularly those interested in Spanish visual culture."
3,As usual - easy read,Another book by MK. Nice and easy read and somewhat entertaining. Plenty of historical references but true historians could have plenty od reservations about it as well. Overall C to B-.
4,Just as much a NYC history without the oyster.,"The Big Oyster is an excellent history of New York City. Unlike many of Kurlansky's books, which always kept the spotlight on the subject (like cod and salt) and its role in history, The Big Oyster often strays far from the oyster. Many of the tales of NYC, from business and prostitution to transportation and development have nothing to do with the oyster. Had this book kept the focus on oysters it would have been much shorter.If you know what you are about to read ahead of time you might enjoy it immensely. This is more a book about New York than one of its early exports and favorite delicacy."
2,"All shell, no oyster","Mark Kurlansky has a great idea: tell the environmental and economic history of New York from the perspective of the oyster. This is normally the kind of book I eat up (pun intended). He has done his research, and if you love New York or oysters or both, you will find a few gems in this book. Unfortunately, Kurlansky's writing and story-telling skills are so lacking that the book reads like a middle school history text: this happened, then that happened, etc. In the hands of John McPhee, this would have been a fascinating read, illuminated with big characters and portentous actions. Instead, it's all shell and very little oyster."
3,Expecting more of history of New York,"I read Kurlansky's Salt and Cod so I bought this one expecting more of the history of New York than recepies. Nevertheless, its like rest of Kurlanskys books easy to read and highly entertaining (though Salt is by far more enjoyable for history addicts)"
4,"It's tough but if you have a 2000 Legacy wagon, it will drag","2000 subaru legacy wagon. This thing has worked like a charm, but it goes under the tailpipe by at least 4-5 inches, there is no reason for it to go so low under the tail pipe. I've dragged it over several states, it seems to hold up even with the constant grinding, but it drags on a regular basis any time there is a large dip going in or out of a parking lot. If I could weld, I'd cut the part under the tail pipe and move it up four inches and it would still easily clear the tailpipe. That picture is not even right, the bar that goes under the tail pipe hangs down at least two inches under the bottom of the main bar.Why four stars? I've dragged it, I've put three bikes on a rack using it, I've carried a cargo tray packed with stuff for hundreds of miles, I've used it with a canoe carrier. It's never failed me. It's built like a tank. Just part of it is engineered wrong."
1,This Hitch Does Not Fit a Subaru Outback Wagon,"Do not order this hitch. I ordered this hitch for a 2003 Subaru Outback Wagon. As others mentioned the hitch does not fit properly. I spent two hours prepping the car and trying to hang this hitch, and found there is no way the hitch could properly and safely be mounted. I need to return it to Amazon and because they say the issue is not theirs I am on the hook for return shipping. Save yourself the time, frustration and money and do not order this hitch."
5,The Right Fit,"I bought this hitch last spring so I would tow with my Subaru Outback. I could have bought something else, something used but I wanted it to fit. The hitch fits fine although I haven't had the chance to use it yet. Also, like stated in other reviews of this hitch throughout the internet, you'll want to pick up a pack of washers so you can get it fit snug and centered on the chassis. This was the case for my 2004 model and may not be the case for other generations."
4,Bleak and yet hilarious,"I guess like many American readers, I first became interested in Celine by way of Bukowski. It was a mistake to begin the book with expectations of similarity in terms of style or content, but I quickly warmed to this great author's totally unique voice and view of the world. The ability to combine outrageous humor with the grimmest subject matter imaginable is a rare talent, and Celine had it in spades. I'm quite sure this is one book I will be revisiting often in the future."
4,Take the highway to the end of the night!,"Perhaps you are like me, who has come upon this book by hearing it from the late great poet/writer/frontman Jim Morrison mentioning it in great lengths. There's even a song dedicated to it. De Celine has been accused of being a nazi collaborator and a misanthrope, but it is the work of Art that we should judge. This book is not as misanthropic as what most contend, it is written in an amazing way, and to say the least is one of the most unstable books I have ever read. The main character finds himself in the strangest situations, and goes through an array of adventorous, grotesque, and ultimately absurd tribulations. It's a very strange book, and that's why I enjoyed it."
4,"too long, but even so a must read ( at least some of it)","This book is too long... The language is beautiful, though. there's no real story which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but for a book without narrative progression is goes on way too long to hold my interest.I have to admit I have not reached the ending yet (im on p 300 or something) and maybe the ending will be so rewarding i will have to take my words back..."
5,Not enough stars for Celine's masterpiece . . .,"""Journey,"" as some of you will soon find out, is not for the faint of heart. Thru the eyes of Celine, the reader is (constantly) confronted by a parade of human debris, who, in turn, exhibit all that is wrong with humanity. It is dark, crude, even brutish at times, but if you can curb that feeling of nausea within, then you will discover one of the most amazing books, bar none, that has ever seen the light of day.Buy it, read it, experience it. But do buckle-up, because the one and only Celine all but guarantees that things will get a little bumpy around here, especially for the first time reader.Hey, you only live once, right? Enjoy."
5,A Journey to the centre of ourselves,"Céline's ""A journey ..."" is one of the books that should have changed XXth's century litterature. It is amazing how, after reading this book, other authors have tried to express the same hallucinatory and exhilarating view of our times, failing by years-light, of course. Reading this book is one of the most painful, most terrible experiences any reader must endure. Céline's view of the world makes no concessions. And despite that, he makes us laugh loudly in every page. He showed us just that the complete insanity in which we live can only be tolerated if seen with the eyes of delirium. Céline's book(s) make all the serious discourses on the suffering and seriousness of human life look just ridiculous. How can anyone write anything after that (except Bukowski)?"
4,Celine translated from French?,"The only way one can truly appreciate Celine's work is to read it in French. If you read a translated version of one of his books, you only get a glimpse at the true genius he was (style has always been more important to Celine than the story itself...). For that, I envy those who master English enough to read Joyce: I've tried to read it in English but had to swich to the French translation. I resumed reading with a vague sentiment of frustration, feeling I had missed something... So much for the language barrier!"
5,How can anyone with a brain pan this novel?,"This is in response to all the people who bashed ""Journey"". Celine is the greatest writer of the past 2000 years and if you can't appreciate him you obviously have no taste or feeling for great writing. If you want something safe and predictable (ie ""uplifting"") then go read John Updike or Toni Morrison. ""Journey"" deserves its reputation and for anyone to rehash Celine's ""collaboration"" is incredibly lame. You've got to know something about the Celine's politics and Europe at the time before you start parroting some PC tripe. Here's to Celine, a true poet of the 20th century."
5,"Here is where you use the word ""best"".","I first read the journey when serving the army back in Yugoslavia. Everything around me didn't make much sense, even though others seemed to think so. Then I read the journey and felt like I was the one really understanding. I've read the book couple of times since and still adore it. Only Fante, Hamsun, Kafka and sometimes Buk can reach up to Celine."
5,Unsurpassed,"I first read this book during my freshman year in college. That was in 1990 - I have read it at least once a year since. I am a voracious reader, ingesting well over a hundred books each year and have not yet found another book that resonates with so much energy, grit, and beauty."
4,Better than Miller,"Celine is often lumped together with Henry Miller (who admired him), but Celine is the better writer, at least in Journey to the End of the Night. (And in Ralph Manheim's translation.) Like Miller, Celine writes about Paris and his relations with women. However Celine was a soldier and a doctor and saw much more of life and Paris than Miller ever did. This is a funny and sad novel that was very influential and, in fact, inspired Joseph Heller to write Catch 22."
5,Sadistically funny,"Although i am sure i am not as elequent and informed on the author as some of the reviewers for this work, I have to say that i love this book. To bring it down to all us non-academics. This book is a must read if you are looking for an experience in dark humor, shocking honesty, and thoes moments when you read a book and find yourself scoffing involuntarily. It is truely genius, and everyone should at least aquaint themselves with this fabulous work. A good place to start if you are interested in his other works."
2,Short range radio?,"Had no problem programing the unit, but during testing,sometimes all three of the OneLink units don't sound the alarm.It's like the signals are weak or something.About half the time, they all test fine.My problem is, if the unit in the basement detects CO,I need the bedroom unit to wake me up! Every time!I spoke to tech support and I think these units onlysend ONE transmission to the other units, during testing.BUT, in case of fire or Carbon Monoxide (CO),they should keep repeating the transmission, many times.I HOPE!"
3,Make sure they are ALL one link,"If all of your smoke detectors are not ONE LINK, then this is just another smoke detector."
2,"Buy the movie, not this soundtrack","Save your money. I love the movie very much, and to watch it and to listen it is an experience like none other. However, if you look for the music from this movie, do not look here. This is just the movie, except without video. I have great respect for Bonfa and Jobim's work on this music, but they do not get glorified truly since the tracks change so quickly and the movie sounds play such a large role in the soundtrack cd. Listen to Trio da Paz and their Black Orpheus album and see how it compares, and even though it is not the original Jobim or Bonfa, it pays more homage to them than this original soundtrack. Verve took the wrong route with this one. Yes the music is landmark in evolving Samba/Bossa Nova, but this cd does not depict truly how wonderful the music is."
2,Disappointing,"I love Brazilian music and the many artists who wrote it. I have heard the music from this CD performed on other CDs and live. However, this CD is not good. It is filled with as much movie soundtrack background noise as music. You would be much better off seeking this music from other sources."
5,THIS CD IS SO GOOD,This movie is totally powerful. I never felt Greek tragedy like that. It's an emotional masterpiece.THe CD is unique. Half of it is beautiful samba. The other half is the ambience of a haunted Santaria carnival. It's really spooky. This is my favorite CD of all time.
5,NOTHING LIKE THIS!,"There is nothing like this album. 30-some years after first hearing it, it still lives in my head. A piece of art - up there with La Traviota, Carmen, West Side Story. For art and music lovers, it is a necessary possession."
5,Well written and illustrated,"The authors and illustrator have made a potentially complex and confusing subject, easy to read and understand. The book is extremely helpful to those interested in the basics of the Catholic church and what goes on inside the walls, and what the various articles of clothing and objects mean or stand for."
2,Helpful for all catholics,I have used this book in my sunday school class for the last 10 years and I highly recommend it for all. This book helps everyone to understand the terminology used in our catholic faith.Children love the book because of the pictures.A good reference book for all.
4,a very enjoyable read,"Although this may not be the masterpiece of 20th literature, I have to admit that it was a very absorbing read. As we follow Charly, the well-bred perfect English gentlemen, through his week long vacation in Paris, we become ensnared in the life story of the prostitute he befriends and her web of friends and acquaintances. The story itself is interesting in its own right, but what really makes the narrative flow is how Maugham lets us peer into the psyches of various characters, all from different social strata. My personal favorite was Berger, Lydia's husband who despite his rogue behavior was one of the more memorable (and even likable) characters. Simon, Charly's friend was drawn perhaps a bit too extremely, but Maugham does use that to some effect. In any case, a fun read and a good story."
3,passably good,"The ease and the smoothness of Somerset Maugham's style make reading this book enjoyable. However the story itself is just OK, nothing extraordinary. However keeping in mind that it's a preWWII novel, there are some intelligent political remarks and astute psychological analysis of the charachters"
3,Not the operetta,"If you are expecting the operetta Roberta, you may be disappointed. Although the story is basically the same, the stars of this movie are Astaire & Rogers, (Huck & Liz) who were secondary parts in the operetta. In fact, John (the male lead of the operetta) doesn't sing and his songs have either been eliminated or are sung by someone else. Also, it is badly in need of remastering; the audio is poor and the video is fuzzy in spots. Nevertheless, it has good dancing and good music. I would recommend waiting until it comes out on DVD."
5,Astaire and Rogers are at the top of their form.,"I have had the opportunity to see this movie several times and want to own the video someday. The music and dancing is extrodinaire, and the acting is impeccable, I simply loved it. Irene Dunne has a wonderful role as so often she did in movies of this genre......such as ""The Awful Truth"" and ""My Favorite Wife"" both co-starring Cary Grant. Even the fashion boutique slant to the ""Roberta"" story is interesting in that the designs are quite beautiful and viable for the year in which the movie was made. Again, if only for the dancing of Astaire and Rogers this video is well worth seeing over and over."
3,Not pillow soft,"I drove 30 miles one way to sit in one. It is NOT pillow soft, but rather hard on this old man's posterior."
3,The Birth Of The Cool,"Lewis MacAdams does an adequate job of detailing the ""birth of the cool"" providing biographical sketches of many of the coolest people to have lived. The list includes Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Lester Young, Jackson Pollock, and the Holy Trinity of Kerouac, Ginsberg and Burroughs, among others. MacAdams book is a great introduction to all these figures, although I suggest after reading this book you will seek to delve deeper into the lives, art, music, and writing of everyone detailed in the book."
3,Slapdash in details but generally on the money thematically,"Reviews of this book on this site have characterized it as sloppy, uninformed, and even erroneous in certain historical details. I would have to agree that the book is breezy at times, and at its worst is slapdash in its treatment of what is probably one of the most important cultural phenomena of the past fifty to sixty years, i.e., the development and growth of the idea of ""cool"" as a form of cultural currency. Despite the misgivings, though, I think this book's themes are right on the money. Read in conjunction with other more attentive books about the phenomenon in question (and/or the historical period), this book can be a door-opener or a good supplement, depending on your point of view."
2,Shallow and somewhat bland...,"I was hoping for some kind of in-depth discussion of cool and its history in the 20th century, but this is more a high-school textbook treatment of cool.So-and-so was cool and this is why he was cool. And then so-and-so was cool and this why she was cool. On and on. A few interesting spots, and a quick introduction to some of the major figures in jazz and art, but little more."
1,Disappointment,"""Art of Virtue"" was in my CD changer all summer of '07. It and ""Plow to the End of the Row"" I listen to all the time. Nothing on this CD interested me, very little mountain music, too somber for my taste."
5,the ultimate death metal album.......,"to mega therion is without a doubt one the most underrated metal albums of all time.to all naysayers who says death metal artists are talentless,have never listened to this album.while most of the attention goes to circle of the tyrants,i find it's in fact one of the weaker tracks on this cd.for me the best tracks are innocence and wrath,dawn of meggido and tears in a prophets dream.but i find everysong on this album is quite a treat to listen to.if you are a true hardcore metal fan than you need to add to mega therion to your collection and everything else by celtic frost with the exception of the cold lake album ."
3,puh leeze,"I am not a fan of metal in general or death metal in particular so this is not a general review of this album. I am simply responding to the claim one reviewer made that the songs on this album will ""scare the **** out of you."" Well, I guess different things scare different people, but the vocals sounds to me like an adolescent d****** bag trying to make his voice all scary and failing miserably. I kinda felt bad for the guy (assuming his intent was to sound menacing rather than funny). Lame pimply teenager trying to make scary voice does not = scary."
5,Classic Black Metal,"What more can I say than ""Shear Perfection"". This was my first introduction into black metal and I have yet to find a better album in this genre. Nuff Said"
4,Nice,Both my Dad and I really liked this CD. It's not totally spacey and new-age but still has a magical quality--mixed with the interest of Celtic music.
5,My Prerogative Pt.1 ~ Britney Spears,"Spears cover sounds nothing like Bobby Browns original tune and that is not a bad thing since she is supposed to put her own stamp on a cover track and not just sound alike since then it would have been a copy and not a cover. It is rough, angry and filled with venom and she looks quite made on the cover as if she is about to have a fit of rage. I like it allot and it shows that Spears is not one dimensional."
3,not the best cover but she did hold her own....,"britney spears is a great performer and she has done a handful of lackluster covers (i.e. ""you got it all"", ""and the beat goes on"", ""satisfaction"", and ""i love rock and roll"") but this song, to me, is the best cover she has done (and i did say in her collection of songs)...her cover songs are not good at all...i know that she is making a statement but please leave bobby brown's hit alone!!! the only good thing about this cover is the beat... the beat is awesome... it sounds deeper and darker than bobby's but this does not light a candle to the original....i dont think that britney should do anymore covers because she is not right for them.....but if she does do a cover make sure it is a good one that people will not hate on you for...."
2,Wish Thunderpuss was still around...,"While Britney's cover of 'My Prerogative' earns 4 stars, the remixes are weak, and really do not do justice to the song, and its potential as a club-hit. The mixes on this CD do not live up to the standard set by DJs like Junior, Calderone, Hex, Cox or Harris."
4,Remarkable,"What strikes me most intensely about this album is that the recording of Spring is Here is heartbreaking. Its feigned indifference is unusually powerful. My Foolish Heart is remarkable as well, sultry yet emotional. By comparison, I Should Care, Who Can I Turn To, and Make Someone Happy are so-so. For me, the other two pieces, written by Evans, were unimportant. The Solo piece takes up over 13 minutes."
3,"Got this to work with a 24"" LCD","I was expecting more flexibility regarding height and depth. I would likely go with a model that had a separate slider for height, BUT they are twice as expensive if not more.With the standard installation this will not allow you to rotate a 24"" monitor. I put in some spacers and used the lowest bolt settings on the clamp and it works ok. It is very stable. I even have it mounted to the side of my desk so that the arm and wires are not as visible."
2,Cliffhanger,"Although, professionally produced, Cliff never moves beyond safe songs and arrangements. And, many song lyrics are pedestrian at worse to simple at best. A few songs were hits in England and will inspire feet tapping or shuffling.Cliff fans will enjoy this album but it is not reason to spend money, except of course if you are a Cliffette. In my opinion, although he was one of the early British rockers and rock stars, this album demonstrates why he never achieved icon or superstar status. Other than aging Cliffie fans, I doubt that many people even remember him or this album. It is not going to make the list of the top 1000 or 500 albums. End of story. Sorry Cliffettes."
4,"Bittersweet, Pensive and Soulful","This music is a perfect match for a rainy, cool day. Rainy days can be nice. This music makes you stop and think about life. Chris Botti's trumpet is always smooth and melodic. John Barry is one of the great composers of our time. (Think 007 themes).You can immediately pick out the Chet Baker tunes in this CD. These songs transport you back to a speakeasy bar in the 50s. You feel you're in a smokey bar way after midnight contemplating life's troubles. This is an excellent CD to introduce or reintroduce yourself to Chet Baker, Chris Botti and John Barry."
4,Better for Bunnies than Rabbits,"This is a well made Item. I bought one 6 years ago for one of my rabbits. He loved it! Unfortunately, at 4 months he had outgrown it. I cleaned it up and saved it for my next baby bunny. She also loved it. This item is great for baby rabbits, or very very small dwarfs under 4 pounds. But not the greatest for adult rabbits."
4,Phoenix Gold 2 channel 250 RMS aplifier,This amplifier definetly puts out the power it claims. Very clean aswell. Be aware that this amp DOES NOT have an adjustable gain.
4,"Better than the second, not as good as the first.","While the second book of the first Dune prequel trilogy trudged along trying to build up suspense, the first book set the stage and was far better. The third book, though inferiour to the first, concludes the set up and end the trilogy's side stories. While interesting, it still suffer from what all prequels suffer from. We know what happens.I enjoyed the sub plots, the fact that each characters actions will have huge ramifications later on."
2,A big bore,"I am really sorry for Frank Herbert's legacy.This book was by far the worst of the three prequels, which were all mediocre at best.Now that I am reading Dune 5 ""Heretics"", wow! What a fresh change!"
2,Dune--MTV Style,"The downfall of this book--as with the other Herbert/Anderson Dune prequels--is the ridiculously short chapter length. By failing to focus on individual characters or plotlines for more than a few moments at a time, they fail to provide depth of character, emotion or story.The average chapter length is three pages, which is hardly enough to give readers a taste of their characters. And instead of this style giving their work a sense of tension, the ""quick cut"" chapters only left this eager reader deeply unsatisfied.One of the many strengths of Frank Herbert's writing was the depth with which he explored his characters and settings, giving even his most imaginative creations a strong sense of reality.By contrast, the Dune prequels including House Corrino, spend too little time on any one character or plot for anything to ""stick"" in a reader's mind. This vapid style might work for MTV, but fans of the original Dune novels will be disappointed by the lack of substance."
1,Great!,"Amazing that the old boring Dune series served as inspiration for these splendid prequels.Witness the introduction of a [quote] Bene Gesserit makeup specialist [unquote] !Comic relieve at House Harkonnen featuring an etiquette instructor and a young Feyd Rautha !Over 300 chapters per volume !There's so much innovation and addition here that it is hard to believe it's all crammed into 3 volumes.Whereas the original Dune was difficult to comprehend and really rather bookish this great joint effort reads like a dream. Everything is patiently explained in full detail and there are helpful reminders in every chapter on who, why and what to avoid confusion.Still, given the overall complexity I can't really recommend this trilogy to anyone under the age of seven.A solid 6 stars. (The meter stops at 5 so that should read 5 plus 1. Stupid system!)"
2,House Corriono,Servie was very good . recived my book within about 4days after i ordered it. very happy with it
3,Not my favorite,"Out of the trilogy, I'm not certain this was that great of a book. While it is set in Frank Herbert's universe, I'm not certain it really fits; however, there are some amazing quotes and one liners that I truly enjoyed. The main reason why I continue to read books in the Dune universe is that it is fun to finally read something about events that happened prior to the main cannon. The quality of writing is suspect and not at the quality level of Frank Herbert. The complexity is also not there either..."
3,The last of the prequels is probably the best,"Alright, so this isn't good ole Frank writing, but that'd be too much to ask for.Overall the prequels weren't up to standard, but as the series developed, it got better, or I got used to Brian and Kevein's writing...Suffice it to say that this is a good finale to this trilogy, there's enough surprises to keep you interested and the book is well paced. The characters are still not very beleivable, sometimes a bit cartoonish. You'll be left wondering how Shaddam or the Baron ever survived their first years, let alone came to positions of power after reading about their latest blunders, but hey, it is entertaining, albeit mildly irritating sometimes.My advice: don't take these books too seriously, just enjoy taking a look at an alternate Dune universe."
3,Dune in sloooooow motion,"I have been a passionate fan of Dune, I've bought the books as soon as they were published and devoured them on the spot.Somehow ""House Corrino"" did not grab me like the others. There were many instances where thoughts from previous chapters were repeated (just to remind us that THIS is where we left off :-) The writing did not seem to be as fluid as the other Dune novels. I feel the book would have benefited from having some of the excessive detail trimmed (fashion, etc) in favor of substance.Other than that, like the other reviewers I did appreciate the ""prequel information."""
4,Much better than the previous,"I'll try to be brief.House Corrino is a much better book than the previous two in the trilogy (House Atreides and House Harkonnen). These too books, most probably, had to be written to introduce characters and plots for the interesting developments in House Corrino.My advise: keep going with the Atreides and Harkonnen and be happy when you arrive to Corrino.Lots of plots are non-important and could probably have been omitted. My opinion is that B. Herbert and K. J. Anderson tried to fill the pages they had already sold to the publisher. Anyway, they make the books more lively and clearly clear the way for The Hunters of Dune and Sandworms of Dune.You should not fool yourself in ever thinking they are as good as the original F. Herbert books, they are just fun anbd extend the universe in the Dune character's universe."
5,Great Action,"I will keep it simple. Great Action. If you enjoy Dune, you should enjoy this book. I enjoyed the other 2 books in this series too, but I enjoyed this one the best. For me, it was hard to stop once I got going."
2,"Bad writing, worse story","It shames me to say that I finished the entire book. That's the only reason I gave 2 stars. It was only out of curiosity to see how this shameless son of Frank Herbert would further defile the great Dune legacy. It's truely amazing how little original thought went into this book. The only story lines are filling in details that Frank Herbert intentionally left vague or following one-dimensional characters down one-dimensional plots. I'm drawing the line here. I'm not going to buy the Butlerian series and give more money to these sick so-called authors.There are only 6 Dune books, however much we might wish for more."
2,"This was sad, really.","I did not feel that i was reading a Dune novel as i read this. like its predecesors, it was poor writing. Very amateurish in style, and not worthy of Frank Herbert's title. You often wonder if the authors actually read Frank Herbert's awesome works."
2,We're Duned,"This book completes the Dune prequel. It's not bad until you consider it in comparison to Frank Herbert's work against which it pales. As the story wound down, I kept wondering how the storyline was going to be reconciled with ""Dune"". The result was unsatisfying in the same way that a TV show resolves a cliffhanger with one of those scenes where it all gets explained away.Frank Herbert was one of those science fiction writers who explored the intersection of politics and technology with a savage intelligence. Dune is just one example, The Jesus Incident or The Dosadi Experiment are others. The prequel lacks the imagination of any of these books. As I said, on one level it's not bad. The story moves along and the characters are sympathetic or despicable as called for by the plot line. But ""Dune"" it ain't."
4,A fine finale!,"After the very long House Harkonnen, this succinct finale leaves one ready to delve back into the original series and experience once again the wonders of Dune. House Corrino succeeds in weaving some rather intricate plots together without burdening the reader. I have yet to refresh myself with the original DUNE since completing this book, but am eager to do so. I cannot account for any discrepancies at the moment and therefore found the book a rather fascinating read (only if you've read ALL of the other DUNE books)."
4,Well written and consistant,I enjoy the fact that nothing I've read so far by Brian Herbert in his father's world conflicts with his father's writings. The characters are consistant yet freshly portrayed. Cheers all around!
3,Any Dune Fan Will Like Corrino,"Corrino is the third book in the Brian Herbert Dune prequels but don't let that fool you. You can easily pick up this book and begin reading without having ever read *any* of the Dune books at all. At a basic minimum, you should have at least read Frank Herbert's Dune book that started it all.I'm about half way through this title at the moment and I'm finding that a lot of the material feels like deja vu. I haven't read either of the prequels but I have read the first Dune novel and Corrino is eerily remniscent of those storylines.All in all I like Corrino bc I'm a Dune fan and fully intend on reading Atreides & Harkonnen but the intricate storylines and creativity that made Frank Herbert a legend are qualities that are strangely missing in son Brian. I suppose that's what happens when you try to improve on someone else's literary masterpiece. Hey Brian, how about developing your *own* universe instead of borrowing from your father's."
2,"Details, details, details","Am I the only one who realizes that they killed the Queen, yet in the 1st Dune book, she's actually ALIVE?!?!? I'm one of those crazy people who thinks if you're gonna do a prequal of something, make sure it goes with the stuff that's supposedly coming after it!!"
1,"The only reason I read it all is: ""Frank Herbert"".","Frank Herbert managed to write a series so good that I read even ""House Corrino"" (and the other two, for that matter)to the end.I mean, the discrepancies with the Dune Series (such as when Anirul's Other Memory invite her to join them, like they were some kind of spirits from beyond) and the simplistic and, sometimes, devastating depicting of some characters (the Bene Gesserit reduced to a bunch of petty and conspiring ""multi-powers"" women) made me stop and sigh every three pages...Still, Frank Herbert's universe is so incredibly seducing and encompassing that somehow it made up for every time I thought about quiting. Dune fans, if you want to spend some more time in the Dune universe - or something like it -, get ready to ""ignore"" the screw-ups.As a better alternative, however, make up your own stories and write them down. You'll probably do better than House Corrino..."
1,Frank Herbert turning over in his grave,"I had the highest hopes for the new Dune Trilogy. I was deeply saddened that Herbert and Anderson came so far from delivering. In House Corrino, Herbert and Anderson take characters and ideas inherited from Mr. Herbert's father and drain them of complexity and interest. The nuanced figures of the Red Duke, the conniving Count Fenrig and the Padisha Emperor are turned into good guy, bad guy and inhuman caricature of evil respectively. The mystical Saddukar are turned into common thugs. The eerie and subtle powers of the original Bene Geserit are made the parlor tricks of silly women. The first Dune's delicate play of power between the Spacing Guild, the CHOAM and the BG was mocked by the one dimensional and monolithic rule of the nearly mad Shadam. Maudlin writing and worse plotting makes this one of the least enjoyable books I've read all year. I would encourage shoppers to purchase and re-read the original Dune, rather than waste money here."
3,A political story,"House Corrino is a book which is extremely politically oriented. If you cannot stand to read about intrigue and politics, then this book is probably not for you.If you can enjoy such things, however, you will find the book quite satisfactory. The dialogue and exposition is well written, and while the pacing sometimes lags a bit, the book provides a pleasant reading experience."
2,More indepth herbertness,"All i really need to say is that this is more Herbert tomfoolery.If you are a fan it is a must read. If you have yet to discover the magic that is Frank Herberts work (now carried on by his son) then go back and start with Dune, and believe me, you will be getting around to this one sooner or later."
2,Destroying the Value of a Great Work,The authors continue to portray 1 dimensional characters that in any realistic scenario would be complete incompetents.There is no subtleness/realism/intelligence built into any of the characters.
4,an interesting book!,"I thought that Dune:House Corrino was a good conclusion to the Herbert/Anderson series. I think that because It filled in a lot of the gaps about the characters and their experiances. The discription of the settings and characters was pretty well done, in my opinion. But I think at the begining of chapters insead of having a little leaf symbol there should be a chapter number. That would make it a lot easier know what chapter you are on. But I think the quotes are a nice addition to the book, they make you see things in the book differently. This book probably wouldn't make much sense to you if you havn't read House Atreidies or House Harkonnen. but over all I think this is a valuable addition to Frank Herbert's colection and is well written. So enjoy this one and I hope the next book will be even beter!"
1,Nice story shame about the prose,"I don't know if its because I re-read the original series while waiting for this book, or if it really is so much worse than the previous 2 books in the series, but I am very disappointed.The writing in this book is pedestrian at best and space opera at worst. the plot flow is linear, sudden abilities helpfully appear (like the Bene Gesserit capability to alter memory), the dialog is written like a poor screenplay, and everything is spelled out in painful clarity rather than by inferrence. The only bits that appealed to me were the litte quotes in the chapter headings :-)If like me you HAVE to read the book to see what happens in the series... and hopefully allow for a finale to ""Chapter House"" to be written then buy the paperback, borrow a copy, or visit a library.I'm just hoping the next Dune book is worthy of the series because, for me, this one wasn't."
4,Moonlighting,"Excellent portrayal of hardships immigrants suffer when displaced (even of their own free will) from their native country (Poland in this case), in order to earn a decent wage. Jeremy Irons and cast very convincing as Poles in England. Saw this once on TV so purchased it from Amazon for Polish friends recently living in Chicago. They both enjoyed it equally. Found it very different from most run-of-the-mill movies. For me it was a ""sleeper""."
5,Historically Significant and entertaining,"Most Americans will never understand why Polish workers in 1981 would give up union wages for a year to work a month for illegally low wages in Britain. Such were the economies in this pre-Lech-Walesa-as-an-international-hero drama. Set in the days before most of the world had heard of Solidarity and before Polish martial law, this brilliant comedic tragedy pulls both together, giving Americans a rare glimpse at the daily oppression many people face as everyday life--and the outsiders willing to take advantage of their plight. Enjoy it as a supplement to your own understanding of history or watch it with your children for teaching and discussion. If you do not come away with compassion for the underdog, you are already emotionally dead."
2,Moonlighting,"I ordered this movie, because Jeremy Irons is a favorite, but the movie was very, very boring - so I skipped most of it, not wanting to waste my time."
5,"well-written, entertaining, and deeply moving","Jackie Joyner-Kersee's autobiography is everything a biography should be, well-written, entertaining, and deeply moving. Unlike many celebrity bios that center around events, primarily ones that reflect well on the author, Jackie's book is people-centered and equally honest about her struggles as well as her triumphs. She writes with love and admiration about many people who have touched her life both in big and small ways. It is not hard to see why Jackie became the woman and athlete that she is. This book could have just as easily been titled ""The World's Greatest Role Model for Young People."""
3,Interesting read,"I like reading about pro athletes and this story was a good one. You can tell it was written by a non-writer, as it's not the best writing, but it's genuine and seems real."
5,After reading this book you will always want to do your best,"I love to participate in sports.Namely track and field. Jackie Joyner-Kersee tells you exactly how it is being an athlete. This book gives you real encouragement to strive to do your best. This book is a real hard one to put down, but gives you inspiration to go outside and start working out. You learn all the pressures and training it is to be an Olympic athlete. You will know that the best athletes don`t give up after severe injuries or conditions."
2,capable of more,"Music is such a subjective transient experience! With that being noted, I am always hesitant to take the time to write a review or comment about a recording ( actually this is a first). This disc starts out with a fairly well crafted moderate-yet mellow, poetic tune that had me initially believing this was going to be a great disc. Unfortunately there are only glimpses of what I like to hear-this recording lost my attention. Mellow, laid back and reflective is fine (ie iron and wine -old elliot smith, nick drake)... Im still searching for something more."
2,"Oops, wrong movie.","I guess I was expecting an episode from the TV series with a different cast. This was probably the pilot movie, before the TV series. I did think that Barbara Eden was great, though. Also, now a days I think science fiction is more based on real science. They probably didn't have as good consultants back in the 60's as we do now.- rickster08Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (Global Warming Edition)."
3,"Better Than The Television Series, But...","This remains the most enjoyable of the ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"" adventures that I recall seeing. Walter Pidgeon is at his absolute best as the driven Admiral Harriman Nelson. His performance is worth alone the admission price of this otherwise routine science fiction submarine thriller. It's a pity Irwin Allen never got his science correct nor his writing; otherwise both this film and the television series which followed could have been a credible underwater version of ""Star Trek""."
3,Format,"I've always liked this movie,but I wish it were in widescreen, and on DVD. Perhaps with behind the scenes footage,and how it became a TV series."
3,The atmosphere is on fire,"If you have seen all these types of films and enjoy the genre then why not try this one also. It has hardly any monsters accept for a giant squid and is mostly about scientists and submarine commanders running against the clock to launch a missile that will hopefully put out a fireball that has engulfed the Earth. Yeah it's daft, but aren't they all? That's why we enjoy them. This isn't exactly the best of the genre but it is watchable. The best part involves a shark heading for the dame in the water."
1,"""Global Warming Edition"" ???","What kind of nonsense is this? This is an obvious attempt to cash in on the global warming bandwagon. There is nothing in this movie that has anything to to with ""global warming"", especially in something made in 1961."
5,LOVE THESE KEYBOARDS,"WHAT A SHAME THAT YOU CAN'T FIND AN APPLE KEYBOARD ON THE APPLE WEBSITE!! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING A WORKHORSE, HEAVY DUTY, OLD STYLE KEYBOARD WHICH I PREFER OVER THE SLIM, ALUMINUM, SILENT NEW ONES! KEEP 'EM IN STOCK. I MAY NEED MORE IN THE FUTURE!! : )"
3,Slim but not touch-friendly,"I bought this keyboard as an alternative to my MacBook Pro's keyboard. What I found was that it is not nearly as nice to the touch as the MacBook's keyboard is. The keys on the MacBook are soft to the touch and easy to type on. I find that this USB keyboard is much more difficult to type on. Often I press a key and it doesn't register so I have to go back and retype, resulting in many typos that need to be corrected. My fingers actually get tired trying to push so hard on the keys to ensure that they ""take.""Most Apple products are phenomenally designed and built. I'm a little disappointed with this keyboard. What is nice about it is its small size. It doesn't take up a lot of room on my desk."
5,Nice keyboard (without all the extras you don't need),"Nice, simple, I use it for my mac and windows machines. Finally, a usb keyboard that doesn't have 50 other useless buttons that get in the way. It's small and a joy to use."
2,Not as expected from X-Travaganza USA,Received a lightly used non USA keyboard of the later white design that used USB ports in the rear and no height adjustment. This did not match the accompanying image. At $72.95 I was expecting USA and new.
3,after 4 years and 9 month,My keyboard came with thee iMac in March 2003. Just about a month ago it started skipping and extra spacing. Cleaning is not an option since the unit is sealed so I am looking for a new one. Maybe 4 1/2 years is not a bad time? What I did not like about this board was that there where no instructions with it that meant discover as you go. This is my main reason why I am going to try a different board.
4,Not Bad,"I bought this keyboard for Mac because I had bad luck with a wireless Microsoft keyboard. By the way I plugged this into my parents' PC for the heck of it and it works on that too. Okay, I digress. This is a great keyboard. I likw rhw extra USB ports. I usually plug my mouse into one of them. Apple has had keyboards with mouse plug-ins for the longest time. I don't know why other companies haven't copied this neat innovation. It's nicer typing my papers on this keyboard than the laptop one. My one complaint is, that since it's so white one can see all the dust on it. On the plus side with another keyboard you would be unaware of the dust and not clean it."
3,It's okay,"This keyboard is rough on the wrists. Very hard to find an ergonomic keyboard with proper Mac controls, however, the design of this keyboard, as all Apple products, is impeccable."
2,Decent but fragile -- caveat emptor,"All of the reviews below are accurate in their evaluation of the style and function of this keyboard, but no one mentioned its unparalleled allergy to spills.As a computer professional and enthusiast I've spilled many liquids in many keyboards over the last twenty years. In all cases, I've been able to dry them off, or in the worst-case scenario, disassemble and clean the membranes. Not so with Apple keyboards. Liquid damage to the membrane is fatal. It's almost as if they used water-soluble switches!So third time's a charm, Apple, or a curse -- last night my third and final Apple keyboard fell victim to literally a few drops of water I spilled from my glass. I shall not buy another one. They're either intentionally designed to be susceptible to damage to force you to replace them, or Apple is so interested in the bottom line as to not care about the durability of their products."
2,poor quality..,I'm about to return my second keyboard. Thee first quit responding to any input at all after a couple of weeks. I tried connecting it to my pc and same thing. My replacement's 'X' key mysteriously reponds only in large case. It's a cool looking keyboard but I can't recommend one given my eXperience.
3,Repeats characters and stalls in Windows XP...,"I really wanted this keyboard to workout. It looks nice, feels great to type on, the right size, and the 2 USB ports are nice when connecting to a mouse or external drive. The keyboard gave me the same problem as another Amazon reviewer which was repeating a typed letter for no apparent reason (something like thisssssssss). Other times I would hit Return and it would stall at the beginning of the next line. And the same thing when I would delete a few letters and start typing again.My previous keyboard was also an Apple for the G4 computer and it worked perfectly on Windows 98 and XP. This new model may work fine on a Mac (I have never tried on a Mac myself) but be warned if you are running Windows XP."
4,works on a PC too - awesome!,"for all those who don't like the look of today's PC keyboards there's a solution: just use the sleek, stylish apple keyboard instead. i'm running it from my win2k PC and it works flawlessly. the 'apple'-key replaces the 'windows'-key on a 'real' PC-keyboard, aside of that, it's like any other keyboard.if you have login enabled you might want to leave your old keyboard connected to enter the password the first time you turn your PC on with the new keyboard plugged in. windows won't recognize the apple keyboard until after you logged in. this is only required once."
4,PRETTY!,"I spilled hot green tea all over my original one (the wireless version)Since my mac mini sits on the desk, anyway, i went for the USB version of the keyboard. SO MUCH BETTER... no batteries required!"
2,"Mediocre keyboard, expensive lint tray","I don't own one of these, thank goodness. But after having freelanced at several places that use this keyboard, I noticed that they do not age well. For starters, certain keys become slightly misaligned with repeated use, and cannot be depressed swiftly. This problem is particularly apparent with the left Command key. Anyone who uses key shortcuts will be frustrated when the Command fails to work (e.g. instead of selecting all the copy in a text box, an 'a' will have been inserted).There is also no covering over the areas between the sets of keys so any dust or debris that falls over the keyboard is 100% guaranteed to fall to the bottom, where it will collect and display clearly through the transparent edges. After a few months, what you get is a keyboard that causes inadvertant typos, while looking like it needs a bath.Fortunately, these have been discontinued. Just don't go buying one now!"
4,"Great keyboard, ony a fill details....","It is the best keyboard I ever had...the only problems are that:- my iPod wont work through its USB;- I havent found out how to use latin characters (to portuguese);- it is White so it gets durty realy easy (but it looks great even though).Anyway, I like it!"
2,"Looks good, a pain to type on.","I have a used keyboard given to me by a professor. I'm not sure if it's the age of the board, but typing on this thing is a bad experience. The keys give a dull, stuck feeling with no tactile response to tell if the key is fully depressed or not. I mistype constantly, either completely missing characters because the key gets stuck or doubling random characters."
1,The M7803 Apple Pro Keyboard was much better,"The biggest problem with this keyboard is that key travel is not smooth. Over time, you will notice more and more friction as you type, resulting in numerous typos as well as untyped letters.I have reverted to a G4 style M7803.Edit: I've replaced my G4 style keyboard with the new ultra thin USB keyboard. The new keyboard is very good."
2,"Nice keyboard, but fragile","I like this keyboard, however it is exceptionally sensitive to liquid. Don't count on it surviving even a small splash or a few drips. It seems designed to channel liquid directly to the sensitive circuit etchings where they immediately corrode and stop fuctioning. Keep this in mind if you have children or if you are not a particularly careful person. Mine lasted about two weeks before getting cut down by a very small splash of tea."
3,"Sometime It ""stiicks""","My keyboard that originally came with my emac died recently. I was all set for buying another Apple keyboard, but something not made by Apple, unfortunately. Well, none of them had the things I needed (eject button, 2 usb ports) so I was stuck with buying the standard Apple keyboard again.As much as I love my Apple computer, my apple mouse, my apple ipod shuffle, this is not my favorite Apple proudct. Heck, I preferred using the PC keyboard I had to use in the days I was waiting for my keyboard to come in the mail!"
5,Fast shipment and great product.,This keyboard is just what I needed. Works great is a great fit for my IMac. Fast shipment and keyboard arrived with no damage.
5,Recently purchased USB keyboard,"Bought this when I was looking for a USB keyboard for a used eMac I'd acquired sans peripherals. I would've sort of preferred the older eMac keyboard, whose USB ports were facing opposing left & right sides rather than the rear, but the price was right. The keyboard came with a minimal amount of wear (a little grime is visible under the keys), but otherwise works fine. Well worth the price I paid."
2,Water Killed It - Glad to See It Go,"This keyboard comes with an eMac and looks great.A little water from my daughter, numerous disassemblies and cleanings and it still doesn't work right. Still, I'm looking forward to a better keyboard. Read other reviews and you'll see comments on the mushiness and inaccurate keying of this keyboard. Believe them. How can a reviewer give anything more than 2 stars to a keyboard which facilitates wrong keystrokes. To me you have to get the basics right. Classic drawback of the keyboard is you type a word and one of the letters is missing.So, two stars and I hope to find a much better keyboard than this one."
3,Never thought I'd give anything less than a 5 for an Apple product.,"I am a diehard Mac addict, but the design of this keyboard allows any liquid to flood underneath the buttons, totally screwing up the keyboard. I even took every single key off, and cleaned it properly. Still, I had trouble with some of the buttons. I tossed it in the trash and bought a cordless Logitech keyboard and mouse. They work great, and you don't see every speck of dust that drops in. Still a diehard Mac addict, just passing on their keyboard."
1,ITEM SHOWN ON WEBSITE IS NOT WHAT I RECEIVED,Be advised that the item shown on your web-site is not what I received. If you do not have the item you are advertising please correct picture showing what you really have. Waiting to hear from you.
1,Is a piece of trash,"I buyed this used keyboard because I believe in his optimal conditions, but I reicived a piece of trash, a dirty keyboard with dust, food prints, dog piles. Is a irresponsability and a ofense sale this articles without maintenance.I can't return the keyboard to the seller because I live in Colombia and the keyboard is with me. I had to shop another one in my town."
4,"Nebraska about 1915, gritty noir with elements of horror.","This is a noir classic. The whole town of Verdon in Nebraska is filled with conflicts, and everyone has a vendetta.This book is also horrific as well, as Thompson at times tries his hand at horrifying the reader. I don't believe this novel is for everyone, but as the back cover suggests, everyone who enters this town should carry a .45."
4,That last guy who reviewed this disc is nutz,His obvious bias against Houston ska renders him worthless as a reviewer... ignore everything he says (especially the part about the resistors - they stunk)!
5,Mercury recordings,"This CD from UK has music from Xavier Cugats period on Mercury, about 1958-1964. Very good with swinging beat. I onw about 55 CDs with Xavier Cugat and many old LPs too. Anybody who wants to discuss this music is welcome to write to me."
4,Best of Xavier Cugat,"If you are looking for Xavier Cugat original style of playing this album will not disappoint you. The title selection contains some of his most popular songs namely ""Fly Me To the Moon"", ""Green Eyes"", Papa Loves Mambo"" and many more. His music in the traditional Cuban Latin style is the closes you can find with a touch of the ballroom sophistication. His ability to have variety in his percussion rhythm section makes his music much more interesting and a pleasure to listen or dance to."
1,"look great, unfortunate flaw","I have two of the Momentum Atlas watches by St. Moritz, one with the white face, and one with the black. They are good looking watches and initially you think they are great--titanium cases, very legible, keep good time. Unfortunately, the screw down crown just does not work well--on both of mine they initially would pop up every little while, now they will not stay screwed down at all. I think the threads are so tiny and fragile that after you set the time a couple of times for daylight savings or change the date, they just strip or something, and I was VERY gentle with mine. Would love to recommend them, but this is a glaring design problem."
5,A Necessary and Informative Guide on Chilldhood leukemia,"As a grandparent of a recently diagnosed 3 year old with ALL leukemia I have found this book an important resource for me to understand the treatment for this terrible disease. The descriptions of the types of chemo used and its side-effects have been particulalry valuable during the early months since the diagnosis. The book is comprehensive with all aspects of the disease and is full of anecdotal and suggestions for coping with this disease at all phases of treatment. It also offers lists of available resources to be accessed. I highly recommend this book for parents, family members and caregivers."
5,Great resource,Our friend purchased this book for us when our son was diagnosed with leukemia. It has been a very good resource to refer to. I really like that it includes real experiences in the families own words.
5,Cleverly designed and strong.,"I have to re-configure my living space on a regular basis. These sturdy boxes have the advantage of being easier for me to store and rearrange than if I had a regular 2- or 4-drawer file cabinet.The boxes are well-designed, and the rails are simple and sturdy. Foolproof assembly. A very good product."
4,Hanging folder fie boxes,"Hey, it's just a couple of hanging folder file boxes.Not reallly a big deal.They arrived quickly & were as advertised.Good enough for me.JR"
4,Looks good with my black macbook,"I bought this mouse because I needed one that looked nice with my black macbook. It's very simple and quite easy to use, but the lack of a middle scrolling wheel kind of annoys me."
1,Bad Quality,"Tried 4-5 so far.They cut very badly, worst by far comapre to the one available in the stores."
5,Chris' Review,"My husband bought this for me as a gift for Christmas. I had it on my wish list and emailed it to him. This product is absolutely great! I'm 60 years old with very dry skin. I've used all kinds of peels, face cleaners, exfoilant's, you name it. This is so gentle to my skin and it feels refreshing when you use it. When you rub the small amount on your finger and rub it into your skin, you can see the dry cells lifting off your face. Once you are done, rinse your face with lukewarm water and your skin is fresh and clean. This is the best!"
2,Get Something Else,"It looks good, the leather seems nice, but the buttons are hard to access and I am required to move the leather out of the way a little to get the headphone jack in. Haven't had any problems of obstruction with the connector on the bottom. By far the biggest problem and most annoying, is that the holes cut for the buttons on the front are too small and the leather is too thick, you practically have to dig to press them. Get something else."
5,Surfing Monopoly,"I purchased this game for my teenager who is a surfer...he and all of his surfer friends have had a blast playing this game. They say, ""it's a great way to kill time while waiting for the waves to pick up""."
4,"Cool idea, neat board and pieces","Neat idea for any surfer, something to do while waiting for swell. Or dream about surf trip...pieces are cool.I would recommend"
2,"L'oreal Excellence Creme Permanent Hair Color, No. 8",Ordinarily I like L'oreal hair color but the box of hair color sent to me looked like it had been on their storage shelf for many years and was outdated as far as coverage for grey hair. Shirley
1,L'oreal Excellence Creme Color,"To be very honest, I would have no idea if the product its self is a good product or not, because the selling description with it, was not made clear enough for a man shopping for a woman, this item is not complete, and needs an additional product in order to be used. Enlarge of the presented photo also did nothing towards making that clear for the consumer. Bascially my family member, has an item that can't be used unless or untill we can find the other part needed to complete use of this item. My advise is, and suggestion, is to be able to ask a question of the seller of the item's for more complete information. Just my honest opinion."
5,CELESTIAL VOICE,"Her phrasing, her swing, her angel-soft voice, in portuguese; The hues of her tone of voice paint the most wonderful colors in the canvas of music and beyond. Only Elis Regina and perhaps one or two more Brazilian singers have gotten up there where she is and where she takes us everytime she sings. If you like bossa nova, jazz, or brazilian music in general, this is a must have and your just one click away."
2,Plain and Bland,"If you like your seeds with absolutely no salt (not that I could detect anyway, although the label says 5mg sodium per serving, essentially none), and chewy/rubbery rather than crunchy, these are for you. For the rest of us, pass these by. The ""subtly sweet"" advertisement was way too subtle for me to detect.El Sabroso Pumpkin Seeds (also on Amazon)are definitely tastier, although still a bit light in the salt department (and no, I do NOT like the frequent store bought seeds that have 3 pounds of salt on each shell). At least they are crunchier, tastier, and don't feel like you're chewing on a tire. El Sabroso's are, however, much smaller seeds."
4,"Remarkebly ""enjoyable""!!","I found this book very much to my enjoy. I have always being doing pantomime, but never heard the ""almost"" complete story about this type of art. This women captures some of the earliest form of mime like if you were there, and gives you a root on where and how the art of the mime began since the beginning. Lots of references and resources included."
4,great but omitted two tracks...,"I really good album, with cathcy tracks such as 'never be anyone else but you' and 'la gonave', to name but a couple. With all the reissues are some b-sides that did not make the albums. When I got this, I was really disappointed, as two brilliant self penned Cliff Richard ballads are not here, but were b-sides to 'heart user' and 'shooting from the world'. 'Small world' and the simply sublime 'I will follow you'. These are tracks that are not easy to find."
1,Not Worth Buying,"Generally I am a big fan of Deepak Chopra and Wayne Dyer. This one was not worth buying. I found that the first half of the material was recycled from previous tapes. The second half had a few new tidbits and restatements of concepts already presented in other books, tapes and videos. At the outset Dr. Dyer talked about this being a project that both of them had wanted to do for a long time. I wish that they had indeed collaborated on developing new insights into consciousness and our relationship to the world."
2,Buyer Beware,"This book covers 3 topics, cassettes 1 and 2 covers ""how to get what you really really really really want"", 111 minutes. Cassettes 3 and 4 covers ""wisdom of the ages"", 96 minutes. Cassette 5 and 6, ""seven steps to get in touch with cosmic consciousness"" 91 minutes. The total length is less than 300 minutes, on 6 cassettes. To get it over 300 minutes, Wayne has to add a 9+ minute introduction to the book. Dyer's newer books like ""its never crowded..."" which has over 7 hours of material offers much better value."
5,Excellent,This CD series is great. I would highly recommend it. Very helpful. Dyer and Chopra together was very educational and inspiring.
5,Grey Gardens (the Musical),"Having seen the musical I HAD TO HAVE the CD. I love the music and play it constantly. I also love the DVD which the musical was based on. I have watched and read everything I could get my hands on about the Beales.And, as always, it's a pleasure doing business with Amazon."
5,One of the most amazing musicals!!,I saw this show on Broadway just before it closed...AMAZING!! Mary Louise and Christine give phenominal performances as well as the ensemble!!!! The music is amazingly well done and the lyrics are wonderfully written! If you know the story of the Beals you will love this musical!! It is addicting! Christine's transformation from Act 1 to Act 2 is amazing!
3,"Great Performance, Disparate Score","Perhaps you have to see the show to enjoy the score, but on its own, it feels uneven."
2,Extremely disappointed,"I just saw the documentary and had to fast forward to get through it. I tried to endure the recording again which verifies (at least for me) the indignity and shrillness of this travesty that violates a pathetic family's dysfunctional psychological pathology. I thought I made a mistake in ordering the off-Broadway cast album but I don't think it matters to me now. Shame, shame, shame!"
5,Ebersole is EXCITING,"Having seen the cult film many times, I thought the musical would just rehash old things. BOY was I wrong! Ms. Ebersole is Unbelievable as the mother and the daughter Little and Big Edie Beale. The writing is amazing incorporating direct lines from the film to the score. BRAVO!"
4,Wrong artwork used to illustrate this item,"I just want to flag up that if you order this CD you do NOT get the one illustrated but the original off-Broadway version. The text does point thsi out but I didn't read it as I just wanted to replace my lost copy of the Broadway production. Luckily I didn't have this version. However, wouldn't it be easier for Amazon just to change the artwork?!"
4,Decent LCD stand...,"Decent stand... Definitely LCD only... Molded plastic but sturdy enough to hold an LCD... Same deal with the speaker stands... The shelf for the monitor is ok sized but not huge... I have a 19"" Dell Ultrasharp LCD and the LCD base hangs over the front by about half an inch..."
4,"Does the job, and does it well","This stand was very easy to set up. The instructions (if you even need them) are very clear. It even comes with a handy tool to determine the proper height for your monitor. I had it set up with the monitor and speakers on it in less than 10 minutes. I use it in my office, and several co-workers have commented that they want one too. I have a 22"" LCD monitor on my stand, and would say that anything bigger than a 24"" would probably be too big for it. I was worried that my big speakers would be too big for the stand, but they fit nicely on the wings, which are very sturdy.All in all, a very nice product. I would easily recommend this to anyone."
5,Nice Monitor Stand,"When I bought this stand, I thought it would be thinner than it is, but its designed in such a way that it saves a lot of space. It's sturdy and well made. The two stands for speakers can be moved and placed in several different positions. A little more than I wanted to pay for the stand but I am happy with it."
5,No regrets.,"This stand elevates my 22"" monitor to a more comfortable viewing level as it does my twin computer speakers on the side platforms. Elevating those three items effectively increases my desk surface area for the other knick knacks. Its solid, effective and you wont regret it."
5,Good Stand,This stand is easy to put together and has a few different configurations so that you can pick what is best for your desk. I've had it for a month and am glad I bought it.
2,biased RFK bio from Right Wing columnist,"This bio is extremely biased against RFK and the Kennedy family. The author Victor Lasky is a right wing columnist. Lasky's most controversial book was It Didn't Start With Watergate published in 1977. He argued that the scandal that drove Richard Nixon from office was little more than a media event.In this book he presents every event in the most negative light possible from the Kennedy point of view. For example, the effort by the Kennedy's to confront Catholic bigotry, he completely discounts as manufactured by the Kennedy's to get votes. The funny thing is that the book is still fairly readable and if you know enough about RFK from other sources you can discount the negative spin and there are lots of entertaining anecdotes and the author is a decent writer. But definitely don't buy this if its your first bio of RFK."
4,Music that will Move You,"Agree with previous reviewers' 'excellent' ratings. This is truly excellent small group swing.Despite feeling slightly 'shorted' by having alternate takes, resulting in only 7 real songs, the performances are superb throughout. Recording quality is much better than expected for a 1943 issue (beware: you can hear some of the scratches as this was obviously copied from a disc and the dynamic range isn't the best. Still, when you hear the performances, the imperfections in recording seem to melt away.)Highly recommended for some deeply moving swing!"
5,good for teaching ESL,"The text is written in a pattern of a number followed by a plural noun. This makes it easy for students of English as a second language to follow.If you are teaching Asian students, who usually have trouble with the plural form, you might like this book."
4,refreshing,"I don't understand why so many people gave this film such a bad review. Sure it wasn't perfect, but I liked it a lot. I felt it was refreshing compared to all these high budget overcomputerized things they have out. Plus, unlike the majority of movies with gay characters, there was a somewhat happy ending. Plus, it really makes you think. It's one of those movies that just gets better and better the more you mull over it. I highly recommend it."
2,"The only reason I don't give this movie one star is, I didn't care enough to hate it.","Just because you have a computer and a digital camera, and just because a few people are willing to give you the spare change out of their pockets to create your production ""budget"", please don't believe the universe is encouraging you to make a movie. The only reason I don't give this movie one star is, I didn't care enough to hate it. The film just isn't strong enough to inspire enough emotion to create love or hate for the effort. It's bad. Really, really bad in that lighting is too dim to see the so-called scenes, acting is too weak to support the so-called dialog, and writing is too poor to create characters and situations that make the audience care."
4,A jewel,"Never mind the low budget, this film delivered straight to the heart with awkward realism. A bit slow at times but still engaging to the touching end."
5,Cast list: Alex Booth is the red-headed girlfriend,"Hey - no mention in the credits here of the brilliant Alex Booth as Sam's girlfriend. Strange...what's up, Morgan?And her brother Jason Booth is the only comic relief in this movie - whoever else could stuff so many rice krispies in one simple breakfast bowl?"
1,Oh please...,"Who in their tiny, little minds could even THINK about giving this thing a positive review? I have seen directors and crews work on a shoe string and come up with magic. This is just woefully bad. Inconcievably horrendous direction, non-actors, a seemingly improvised script, god awful sound, TERRIBLE music,(did I mention the bad acting from the non actors?)inept camera work (honestly, could no one afford a tripod?), painful ""story"" and the most awkward unpassionate same sex kiss (only one)this side of Dawson's creek..This cliche-ridden piece of drek would not be considered a competent effort by community college standards let alone one to sell to the masses. If you want a low budget gay ""Coming of Age"" story try ""The Journey of Jared Price"" or anything else."
2,oh come on,"Ok. i think the producers knew it was gonna suck if all they had to work with was a canon gL2 and final cut pro. They werent going for some really powerful film with great effects. If they were, they wouldnt have bothered. We all know that it sucked. really bad. But you have to look beyond all that. If you cant, thats ok, i found that part hard myself. it has a message. dont get me wrong. But they expressed it differently. The credits were of better quality than the film and they needed to get sum more 'beautiful' people. More people would enjoy it if they had a piece of eyecandy to stare at the whole time to help them keep track of the plot. Which wasnt very in depth."
3,Washing frog,"Cute toy, but it is very hard to get the squeaker to squeak. I could do it but had to squeeze HARD. My dog is a 60 pound border collie mix and she does great with squeakers. This one was a disappointment. I bought the Chimp toy and she works that one fine. They are certainly cute toys. I am going to try the Cow version."
2,Not Cookson at Her Best,"Although I am a long time Cookson fan, I found this book to have an unbelievable plot. Could a young girl raise a family of nine children on her own with no resources? Could a woman, forgive and even come to love a man that raped her and ruined her life, who's family took her illegitimate child away from her? Would a man sacrifice himself in a loveless marriage to provide for a fallen woman? Many of the characters changed their basic natures: the wife, who went from being kind and generous to being insanely jealous, the hero who was cruel and abusive to his mother and wife, and finally, the cowardly rapist becoming the savior. I just couldn't buy into it."
5,The book that got me reading,"I first read this book many years ago, it was the first ""grown up"" novel that I can remember reading and I absolutely loved it. I went on to read avidly after that, and still do! I downloaded a sample of this on kindle, just to see if it would ""grab"" me in the same way, needless to say it did! Thank you Catherine Cookson for showing me the way."
5,targus cpt400 17 platinum deluxe notebook case,Gave this notebook case to my husband for Christmas. He loved it. He loved all the compartments it had. He has a wide screen 15.4 on his laptop and he likes the size. Many of the notebook cases fit up to but not including a 15.4 wide screen. He was just amazed at all the storage the notebook case had. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a larger sized case that will fit 15.4 or larger. Also I would say the free shipping and the speed of shipping impressed me. I have been using Amazon for years and they never let me down. I looked everywhere for the cases but as usual ended up at Amazon. They have a large selection of just about everything.
4,"Durable Case for Toshiba 17"" Notebook",A great case for the price paid. I only considered the leather Targus as a possible alternative. I have traveled twice with it; my only complaint is one of the inside lock & stitch (Velcro) square anchors was not solidly sewn...an easy repair.
5,Recommended!,"I recently bought this case to hold my 17"" HP7000 notebook and it's almost like it was made for it.It has a good amount of storage on it -- nice big pouch in front that I have to use for my power adapter. It also has other pockets in the pouch for pens, etc.The inside has plenty of addition pockets for cd's, business cards and more, and the padding in nice and thick for protecting the computer.The back has another small pouch for paper, and also an additional zipped compartment with a separator for important papers.I'm very impressed by the all metal hardware and the large rubber padding on the bottom edges.This is an excellent case, and the price is a huge bonus. I found it recommended on a forum and am glad that I took their advice, and wanted to pass that along.The only con that I found is that if you've got a 17"" notebook and you want to bring along your power adapter and an additional battery, you will run out of room. Aside from that, go for it!"
4,"It is too large for 14"" laptops","I must to say that this duluxe notebook case is too large for my 14"" dell 600m.Those who have small laptops may need to choose a smaller carrying case instead this one.But it is a really good product."
4,Just what I ordered!,"I looked at the other reviews on this product and many more before I purchased my case for my 17"" laptop. This case is just enough room for the laptop and cord; papers and folders; and the essentials on the inside. No fluff and puff - just the basics, but useful and effective!"
4,Very protective case but......,The strap cuts into your shoulder. The case is very protective of the equipment and has a few extra pouches but the thing is bulky and the strap is to small for the size of the case.
5,Very Durable!!,"The reason I picked this one out of all the other cases was because where the laptop sat was in a zipped up compartment. I also really like how the laptop is strapped down tight inside (a Velcro safety strap to fit to the size of your laptop). There are A LOT of little pockets for all the other things to bring along. I have a bluetooth mouse, and my battery cords that I bring along and it doesn't add bulk at all. It fits my 17"" Dell Inspiron laptop perfectly with even a tiny space left. This is a good product if you travel a lot with your laptop and you want it safe. But if your looking for a case that is lightweight, then don't look at this one. It's not that heavy, but it's not the lightest of the cases...I rated this item 5 stars because I think it's a really good product."
5,Perfect peripheral,"I bought this particular case 2 years ago when I got my Dell Inspiron. Haven't used it real hard but use it often. Has everything one needs in a 17"" notebook case. Our family has 3 laptops, all with Targus cases because of their high quality & we haven't been disappointed."
5,A Real Page-Turner Best Read,"This is one of those magical books that takes one back to a time almost forgotten with all the hardships and good times mingled. Not only does the author involve you in the lives of a family struggling for existence in near impossible circumstances, he has an art of putting one in the place of each of the characters alloiwng you to see and feel as they do no matter what the age of the character.Reminders of the way of society surrounding rural 1950 abound. One can feel the emotions of the characters as they deal with events within the constraints of the times; one can see the landscape and architure surrounding the story; one can smell the odors and fragrances of a time gone by.This book is a real page-turner. I could not put it down and have begun another book by the same author.Mr. Saunders is hardworking in his writing and a very pleasant man to speak with."
4,Tips for the leaders,"This is a quick and short book with tips on how to behave and lead once person has reached senior management position within a corporation. However, if one is a decent person and has a good moral compass already, this book is more of re-iteration of what a decent person should behave like. In any case, when assuming a new position where actions are expected, do not make rash decisions, take tim to feel and assess corporate culture, before any decisions are made. This at least would buy a year in a positon. Be honest, plan succession carefully, take vacation and recycle technology when appropriate while being ready to accept the new one at any moment. Do not be afraid to be #2 because that can always lead to being a #1 eventually. Be professional and stick to business only, personal relationships should be kept outside of the office. The most importantly, always have a plan B even if you never have to resort to it."
5,'Insights' is Loaded with Insights,"I read 'Insights for the Journey' in one evening. I intend to refer to it often. It is 102 pages of wonderful advice, that when first read, seems obvious. On reflection, the seemingly obvious is not at all obvious. I think somebody must have said that making complex issues seem simple was the mark of genius. I was already a Lucht fan from his 'Rites of Passage' and this book further confirms his wisdom."
1,Narrower than other Adidas of the same size!,"I bought these shoes on a whim from Amazon, and was very disappointed and returned them. I normally wear size 10M from Adidas, as I do with my Metrum shoes and SuperStar IIs. Yet with these shoes, size 10M is WAY TOO SMALL, and quite painful. They were returned... If you order them, make sure you get a larger/wider size!"
5,Nice shoes,I bought these for a very good price on Amazon. They are very sturdy and keep my feet very warm in the rain. It's not just for downpours; even in situations where you're walking across a wet field it will keep your foot warm and toasty instead of cold and damp. I generally use these as my cold weather shoes even if it is dry. They have great support.
3,narrow toe,"I have had my shoes for a couple of months now.At first they seemed a half size to small.And the toe looks more narrow than my feet.But after wearing them a while,they seem to be doing ok.The Gortex linning is also nice for puddle jumping."
1,terrible shoes!!!,"I got the shoes for a while and I must say it was a total disappointment! The look and heel were ok, so does the GTX XCR. However, there is a major problem: the shoes won't hold your foot! The opens for the shoes lace (the tounge) are too big so the shoes won't hold your foot intact. This is potential big problem if you really want to hike with it since your foot will just have extra fraction due to the insecure of the foot in the shoe. Hate it ever since I put it on. I have total of 3 pairs of GTX hikers now and this one is the one I regret to out money in!"
1,amazon misrepresented item,incorrect color was shown on the website. it has since been added but it wasnt at the time of my purchase.
2,Expensive,This book has been marked up in price considerably. I just received it in the mail and was shocked when the back cover said 10.99 Euros which would be about $16 american dollars. I paid $42 for my copy expecting it to be bigger. It's only 200 pages total with no pictures or anything of the sort. All in all very expensive for the size content and has been marked up almost 300%!!!
2,not worth the effort,"It's been a little while since I read this (about 5 or 6 months), but I was browsing through some other inexpensive titles, and this one caught my eye with how high the ratings were. I'm in shock, so I feel compelled to write my first review. Now, I wouldn't say it was absolutely terrible, but it definitely wasn't good. There's some decent dialogue and one character in particular is funny, but mostly it's not believable - at all - and dull. None of the characters are particularly likable. I found myself finishing it only because I knew it wouldn't take way too long, and I'd already started. My advice: don't start it."
2,So so story not as good as the demon soocer mom series,I really enjoyed Kenners soccer mom series. This was a real disappointment. I found myself skipping through actually trying to find something interesting to read. There is just so much panting over each other that it was boring.
3,Funny read,"I liked it, I thought it was funny and wouldn't mind reading more. I don't think its worth 5.79 though and luckily for me I didn't pay that."
4,Very Enjoyable,I wasn't sure what to expect but I found the book to be highly amusing and quite entertaining.I'm not much into supernatural reads but it was something I found enjoyable and would try something similiar.Well done!
3,okay,"It's cute, in a goofy sort of way. The characters are pretty one-dimentional and the plot is marshmellowy, but if you want a light read with little plot, you'll like it. I didn't like the hero in the story, he seemed too soft and emotional. That Pierce Bronson comparison, really lost if for me. I don't think an author should ever compare her leading man to any known man in Hollywood, then she puts him in a sterotypical box. A reader can't picture as any other sort, but that actor. You should just leave it to the reader's imagination. Besides, I think Pierce Bronson looks like a dweeb, so how am I suppose to assume the lead character is hot?Well, whatever! Suffice it to say, this book needs work."
2,Very much lacking,"Seeing the reviews I was really excited to read this book but was very much disappointed. I sensed that the author just sat time and typed a book as opposed to developing the story and the characters. There were some many contradictions and the story dragged and lulled in many place.Stories are in the details. For instance the characters found themselves at a backyard party at a supposedly fancy house. There was champagne, the owners of the house were wealthy and there was even valet parking but the guest ate off paper plates??I know that might sounds picky but those are the little mistakes that add up to a bad story, and there was a lot of those little mistakes."
1,Ugh,"Clunky dialog, shallow characters without a hint of emotional resonance and a hackneyed, faux-humorous style. Even at 2.99, a waste of money."
2,I wish I could get my money back,"Blech! The summary sounded interesting and I am a big fan of supernatural fiction- especially romantic fiction but I had a hard time getting through the first 100 pages. I would feel better if I had paid $.99 because at $2.99, I feel like I got a bum deal."
4,Good book,"In Aphrodite's Kiss by Julie Kenner it was very heart felt and surprisingly well written I was a bit of everything romance, action and paranormal"
3,Good but a little dragged out,"The story line and the way its written was decent. I felt that the author was repeating over and over again how important it was for the heroine to stop something, but monotonously. It just seemed like she was trying to say a point but didnt actually get to it.After a while, the whole thing started becoming redundant. What couldve been said in 150 pages sort of dragged to 300. The final confrontation could not be very well visualized and went with a poof. It was a nice story on the whole but needed a little more oomph. Not a very satisfying read."
4,A Great Rainy Day Book,I enjoyed this story...enough so that I am going to buy the others in the series...it's a light book...something to read just to pass the time...I didn't expect to get a quality story from a freebie...but I did!
3,not my cup of tea,"It was quite predictable. I just thought there would be slightly less romance. So if you are into cheesy romance, this is definitely the book for you."
5,Perfect book for any person who doesn't understand love,Usually I don't understand love but this book taught me that even ancient Greeks sometimes Don't understand love like most people do.
4,Good book,If you like mythology and romance with happy endings you will like this book. I would like to read the other ones in the series eventually.
4,Aphrodite's Kiss,This was the first time I had read the super hero series. I really enjoyed the point of views and the emotions and intensity of this story. I didn't know that a person could put so much insight into becoming a super hero or what they might miss out on. I also had never thought about how mortal would react when put into a super hero's world.
1,Fluff.,"I enjoy books that don't take themselves too seriously - something fun and witty. I can definitely see where that was the intention, but it just didn't make it. I honestly had a hard time finishing this book, which is a pretty big deal for me. Everything about it was so cliche' and overly dramatic. The characters had no depth, and the writing didn't do anything to draw the reader in. I like the idea behind the book, but the writing just didn't come through. I was looking for a new series to get into. Guess I'll keep looking."
2,a good concept badly written,"The idea is so good, if only the author could have made it interesting. It is about a world inhabited by people with superpowers. The heroine has to take some tests in order to become a full blown superheroine, while trying not to fall in love with a mere mortal. It reminded me of the old Supergirl comics, except that the heroine was a very silly woman, the hero was uninspiring, and the only interesting person was the villainous cousin. The ending was a cop-out.... Now if this concept had been expanded upon by Nora Roberts or Jayne Ann Krentz, they'd have done a much better job."
3,Charming and entertaining,"The story line was charming and fresh, the charectors likeable and believable. Unfortunatly the writing was not as engaging as the story. However, this was a fantastic mix of fantasty, and romance and I look forward to reading more from this fresh new author."
1,Couldn't finish it.,I love fantasy but could not get into this. It would have to be more interesting just to be boring.
2,On The Fence,"Zoe finds her life changed with her 25th birthday. Who doesn't like chocolate? Who can expect her boyfriend to accept her superhero qualities. Not the best written book, but enjoyable for a freebie."
5,Awesome drill!,"I've had this drill for nearly a year, and use it pretty heavily in the shop on metal, mostly steel and stainless steel. I get about a week of use out of a single charge, and it only takes 1 hour to charge! Doesn't bog down on even work-hardened stainless like any other drill I've used. It gives me the power I'd expect from a corded drill, without the hassle of a cord.Friends of mine in construction have used this model of drill for longer than I have, dropped it off buildings, and use it hours a day without any problem. If you can afford it, buy this drill. You won't be dissapointed."
4,WOW.. customer service too!,"I got a response from Milwaukee on the batter problem I reported in another review.Hello David, I wish you would have wrote to us first. We are aware of the tightness, but it is not in the latches. The housing body screw is to tight in which a Authorized service location could release the pressure on the screw and retighten. We do not recommend battery or charger repair to the customer. The batteries though tight will loosen with time. Thank you John..product service"
2,Not up to Milwaukee's usual high quality,"I bought this drill while doing some remodeling at my girlfriend's house. I didn't want to drive all the way back across town to get my 14.4 Dewalt. I should have!! The bits slip in the chuck and the motor smokes under heavy drilling.For light duty use this drill is fine, but for heavy drilling you should look elsewhere. This is not a top quality Milwaukee tool!"
4,A very good sampler.,"I bought this sampler because it has Hip Walk on it.I've never heard a bad Cal Tjader record. This sampler is a good collection from a number of mid-60s Verve albums.Tjader's Verve albums have the highest production values, thanks to Creed Taylor.As part of Verve's Jazz 'Round Midnight series, this collection offers (for the most part) romantic music; but all of his Verve albums were romantic, so this one does not stand out in that regard."
3,Bossa Nova on a Marimba,"His ""xylophonic"" Bossa Nova sound is instantly fammiliar; elevator music it isn't, but perhaps hotel lobby. Posh New York downtown Hotel's, lazy forgotten tropical bars, to low rent strip malls are all filled with his airy tunes. Perfect for all the lounge lizard's out there."
5,A marvelous exposition of practical typography,"This wonderful book explains how you can use type to help your documents communicate better. It gets into all of the nitty-gritty you expect from a book about typography, but does so without going too far into the tall weeds for someone who doesn't set type for a living.In my work as a technical writer, I have used this book to make my publications much more readable. The author shows how typefaces, the space between lines, the length of lines, the space between paragraphs, and so on all contribute to text legibility."
2,Not much here...,"I've read quite a few marketing and branding books in the past and was hoping to find a unique twist with this book. However, it was poorly written and out of 117 pages there were nearly 50 blank or ""title"" pages and 15 pages devoted to advertising their other products. I felt like I wasted my money."
5,Hilariously funny,"A western comedy with Kriss Kristopherson, Max Baer and many others. This spoofy comedy will have you in stitches."
4,Irish Traditional Drunken Songs!,"In my opinion this is the best Dubliners album ever!(If this is the right cd)The wild rover,dirty old town,7 drunken nights,etc.All worth listening to over and over.......(You should list the artist of this cd it would help a bit)"
3,Great Debut,"Salt N Pepa provided the hot dance tracks with this one. Examples of their power are ""Push It"" (which still gets play in radios and clubs to this day), the original no-good-male denouncement song ""Tramp"" (way before ""No Scrubs"") and ""My Mic Sounds Nice."" The beats on this album have aged well."
3,it is cool,"my favorite songs on this album are, push it, and my mike sounds nice, this is from my genration the 80's, not a big rap fan , but i always loved these songs"
3,Hot Cool & Vicious Salt n Pepa,"CD was in excellent condition. I just remembered this cd content being better than it is now. Probably just a matter of growing up in that time and my youth, but overall alot of fun and laughs."
5,"Salt N Pepa - Hot, Cool & Vicious - 5 stars","What more can be said about the first critically acclaimed female rappers? Hot, Cool & Vicious is Salt N Pepa's best album release, and one of the best pioneering rap works of all time. Included on this CD is a remix of the hit Push It, not originally featured on the tape version. Chick on the Side is a remix and not the original version released. Also, Tramp is not the original version as released on the tape edition, although it is not identified as such. Keep in mind that when these songs were engineered and produced, all recordings were analog. That said, the audio quality is very good if not excellent."
4,Good map for the car...,"I get lost easily in unvisited areas and needed a good reference map for my car.Book stores want insane prices, but this one was a good price and although just a bit dated, most of of the street data is sound. Hardbound, it holds up well.I am more comfortable travelling unknown territories with this to guide me."
5,Absolutely charming and endearing!,"I couldn't be more happy with this Tarot kit! The book is wonderfully organized and I think that the author hits things square on! I love the 'Cat's Interpretation' for every card. Sometimes they are the best way to explain the cards to a newbie I've ever seen. They are playful and approachable and undeniably gorgeous. I have several other decks that I use but my ""kitty tarot"" as I call it affectionately is by far my very very favorite. I treasure them and the book also and I keep them with me all the time. If you enjoy Tarot cards and love cats - this is your deck. In fact - even if you don't know or think much of Tarot - these cards are a still a cat (and art)lovers dream. Oh and the ""bonus"" card is wonderful."
5,The coolest tarot cards around !,These chic feline cards from the lovely Czech Republic is the most gorgeous tarot deck ever made.Highest artistic standard and exceptional quality. You won't be dissappointed !
4,Great,"This is a great deck. I got it for my friend, who is a beginner, so it was kind of hard for her to read them at first. But she got the hang of it and now we're having a blast. The images are fun and every card has a different cat and picture. This is a great tarot deck."
4,"It takes two to tango,,,,","The Priest's WifeThe explosive chemistry between Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren is undeniable. Although this is not one of their best films together, it is still very good. Sophia is delightful as the hot tempered, scorned woman who fails at all her relationships and then sets her cap on a priest played by Marcello. Handsome Marcello is incredibly believable as the celibate, pious priest who tries to help Sofia while attempting to rebuke her advances. Of course he fails so the age old duplicity of priests is well highlighted. Very good movie, well worth a view.,"
4,Avery 3266 Quarter Fold Blank Cards,"The cards are good--some don't fold as easily. The card stock does not have to be as heavy as it is.Also, sometimes the cards are dented on corners because they are not packed correctly. I've had several boxes with dented ends."
1,Same as tghe others that I purchased,This was a reorder and I am completely satisfied except that I would like it if you could make the cards in a Matte finish also
2,Quarter fold computer card paper.,"It is very hard to find quarter fold paper for computer greeting cards. I was very excited to find this on-line. I like the paper quality, but the paper is very thick so when you fold the pages, even though they are scored, they are clumsy and show paper rips at the fold. Sometimes I put a piece of scotch tape on the inside so they will not separate after folding where the scoring is."
4,AVNET Quarter-Fold Blank Card.,I use this product fequently. It is of good quality. The only complaint I have is that I wish the paper would fold more neatly/easier.
3,Have to cut with exacto,"I bought these hoping I could make two single-fold cards/page. But they are apparently designed to make a single 4-page card. For my purposes I have to cut them after printing into two parts. I use an exacto knife and metal ruler, then fold each half. It looks like I should have ordered Avery 08315 instead.By the way, photo reproduction on these cards using an Epson Stylus Photo R280 is excellent."
1,Too heavy,"I have been making cards for about 20 years, and have YET to figure out WHY someone doesn't make lighter weight good quality matte finish paper for quarter fold cards. What I find myself doing is making the outside of the card with card stock and using regular paper for the inside (glued in). It works well, but does require a little bit more work than I'm sometimes willing to put in.That being said, I have no problem with the actual quality of the product other than it's WAY TOO heavy for quarter folds. Had it not be scored to fold in quarters, I'd have been able to keep the cards and use them for other projects. As it is, the package is going back.I might add, that I purchased this product foolishly thinking the weight might be lighter, as I'm sure I'm not the only one who has this issue.It is going back!!"
2,In the immortal words of Jon Stewart,"I saw Jon Stewart interview Kristol last night on the daily show. As best I can remember, Jon said:""Bill, you people were way ahead of the curve! This book proves that you were wrong about Iraq _way_ before everyone else was wrong about Iraq!""That sums it up pretty nicely. I think history will show that Kristol & Co were also wrong about Bush being a conservative (as that word is currently understood) but it'll take a few more years to be sure. Conservatives: buy this book, get extra copies for your friends, remember how sure of yourselves you were, and never forget how wrong you were. Moderates and liberals: all you need to know is summed up in the Jon Stewart quote"
5,Go Gerry,"As a former student of Dr Sterns (way back in the 70's) this book brings back many of my own memories. As Dr. Stern grew up in the coal fields of Pa, the references strike me very deeply as I remember the same things he is writing about. His humor continues to be jacketed in serious thoughts, but just as in class, his brillance shines thur."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"A science fiction struggle over some super powered hybrid children, involving some unpleasant aliens.This is Doran's magnum opus, as the children learn their place and start to understand what is actually going on."
5,A must for every jazz collector!,"Jeff Lorber's State of Grace CD is a non-stop good time of jazz, funk, and lounge music all put together! His tracks are accompanied by some great talent: Dave Koz, Art Porter, Eric Benet, Sue Anne Carwell, Gary Meek, Michael Landau, Marlon McClain, Stuart Wylen, Nathaniel Phillips, & John Robinson. This is not to be missed!"
3,this is a CARTOON,"I was dissappointed because it wasn't the real Ben Hur movie with Charlton Heston (not the cartoon). But we decided that instead of wasting the shipping sending it back...we would watch it. Besides the magic - special effects type stuff (lightning zaps from the cross) and the female angel- I like it better than the hateful, bloody ""real"" movie for my children. Charlton Heston sounds too old for the part."
4,very good dvd for both adults and children,this dvd was a very good movie for the entire family to watch. especially for children it wasn't too long. thumbs up.
2,SINCERE BUT SECOND RATE,"The latest film version of BEN HUR is an animated retelling that emphasizes the novel's original subtitle: A Tale of the Christ.Charlton Heston reprises his Oscar winning 1959 film role as the voice of Ben (and also narrator).Sadly, the animation is second rate and nowhere near the quality of ""Prince of Egypt."" The voice work is not particularly imaginative with the exception of Heston who is more emotional and worldly wise than the blandly drawn young hero. Still, there's an admirable bravery to the provocative enterprise; after all, it's about a Jew on the road to revenge who stumbles across a forgiving Christ. How radical is that?Limited extras include brief statements from a somewhat haunted looking Heston who, oddly, speaks almost without emotion or expression."
2,Not the best SACD mix on my shelf,"I've got about 30 SACD's now to complement the other 1,500 normal CD's. When I want really well-defined sound I often go for the SACD's. Unfortunately, this SRV disc is not that well engineered, as are a few others I own, and it is not really worth the extra money for the SACD version.One would like to think that any SACD you purchase will be seat-of-the-pants better than it's normal CD counterpart, but that is not the case with this one. Not all SACD's sound superior to their CD mates, unfortunately, so let the buyer beware."
3,Was expecting more,"Not sure what happened to MoFi but this recording is a little flat and lacking punch. I have some older MoFi remasters that sound really good but the recent ones dont sound as good to me. Paid a premium for this disc.The cover and sleeve make it nearly impossible to remove and reload the disc into it's cover. Very LP like, but practical for cd's. ( I liked the old MoFi jewel cases)."
2,sound not so good,"I just got this SACD and have a few comments about its sound quality, which is a bit disappointing. First of all, it's a STEREO SACD (as opposed to a multichannel one) and it does not play on a regular CD player as most other SACDs do (as the product info on Amazon rightly points out). And on my surround system the sound of this recording is poor (compared to any other SACD or DVD audio that I own; actually, even compared to most regular CDs I own!). The 2 stars are just for the sound quality, not the actual music!"
3,SRV is great -- but this is not a great album (sorry),"I am going to stick my neck out here -- I was disappointed by this album. Don't get me wrong, SRV is an incredible guitarist. When I first saw him on ""Austin City Limits"" I was blown away. I actually wanted to give up learning to play after watching it -- it was so obvious to me that I could never even hope to get close that good. The gulf was too huge. That said, the quality of the recordings and the versions here are cruder/duller and less inspiring than I expected (I guess I have heard better versions by SRV). The extra tracks, interviews and sleeve notes are nice additions...and perhaps this might push it up to 3.5/4 stars. I am sure there are better SRV albums out there than this one though. As this was their first album (I think), I can understand that fans may have a fondness for it."
1,Not good,"I do not know what the other reviwer is on. The sound on this MOFI is poor and lifeless. The Sony sacd sounds much better, more life, more sparkle, more dynamics. This follows a trend in the latest Mofi releases: They generally sound like mentioned above and is not better than the old remasters. USD 30- What a letdown."
3,Texas Flood,"Recommended highly by a friend, but unless you like country I don't recommend that you spend your money on this."
5,Entrancing,"Very few artists in a life time of the history in music have accomplished what Steve Ray Vaughan did in a short life. Stevie was a master. Stevie was an artist that played the guitar with such emotion and feeling that you knew he was not holding back. At times it would seem like no one existed around him while playing. He had the ability to draw you in with his music and not let go. His emotions , real emotions , were played to everyone. Sometimes it was joy , other time it was complete agony. Each time he played , it would not be different. Some of the things he did boggeled my mind. I could not imagine how Stevie could play so fluent with a guitar behind his head ; remenisent of Jimmi Hendrix. His playing , music, emotions would bring a tear to my eye and cause the hair on the back of my neck to stand up."
5,Come back SRV,There is nothing new left to say about SRV. This album shows off the best of SRV. Most albums have tracks which show his talent and tracks which you classify with 'you could have done better'. This album has no such deficiency.
5,good project,"Steve Ray Vaughan one of the best blues guitarrist in the world, in this album ,Texas Flood , with three live performances as bonus tracks with Chris Layton on drums, Testify live version is unreal great guitar play very well played,there is not question about it he was good.I strongly recomend this album for anyone ."
4,A SRV must,"SRV was one of the greatest. This ablum features the studio versions of some his classic tracks such as 'love struck baby' and 'texas flood'. Well worth the listen. However, as with most of his albums, there are a bunch of forgettable tracks which diminish the impact."
4,Smokin',"This album was Stevie's first in an all too short career. This was definately one of Stevie's better studio releases, but not his best. A guitar player's player, Stevie employs his stronger ability as a guitarist with 3 of the 10 songs being of the instrumental variety, including the love song which Stevie always dedicated to his wife Lenny. My only gripe is that Pride and Joy and I'm Cryin' sound nearly identical. I guess I ask too much. This album does provide a good representation of Stevie's abilities and is an excellent choice for any collection."
4,Stevie Ray convert,"I have been listening to this album a lot since I got it 2 weeks ago. I would recommend Texas Flood as a good first Stevie Ray album--it was mine. His guitar sounds like it's just dying to make energetic and unpredictable music, and Stevie's job is to choose when to let it out. He makes the guitar sound like a living thing. And he is a great singer. I never liked his music before, but since I moved to Dallas I've been drawn to the myth of Stevie Ray and now I've come full circle and really like his music, too."
5,Awesome Debut Album,"Stevie Ray's first album comes out smoking, wheather you like the hits songs (like Pride and Joy or Love Struck Baby) or the lesser knowns (like Lenny or Dirty Pool), this album really delivers. The live bonus tracks top the cd of with some great songs both released and unrelesed till now."
3,A little muddy compared to the 1999 remaster,"This is a great album as we all know, however, while A/B comparing, this Mofi edition sounds a little muddied when compared to the remaster release from 1999. The upper mid frequencies have been rolled off and this results in a loss in detail in the drums and guitar. The bass guitar also sounds less powerful when compared to the '99 remaster. I get the feeling they were trying to master this to sound like a vinyl LP, and I've noticed this with some other Mofi CDs and SACDs, but not all. Personally I prefer a CD/SACD to be mastered to sound like the original master tape, but that's just my two cents. If you're looking for an SRV album that Mofi did right, I recommend Couldn't Stand The Weather."
5,Texas Flood cd by SRV,"I don 't know of a single SRV song that wasn't written well or performed exceptionally. ""Double Trouble"" was a perfect back up to the Texas style rock.This is truly timeproof music, where the feet can't stop tapping.If you love timeless music that is performed by the best, lend an ear to SRV & DOUBLE TROUBLE!"
5,Terrific Album!,"Great album at a great price!The CD was delivered in a timely manner and in excellent condition.The more I listen to SRV, the more I think he may just be the best!!"
5,Texas Flood Legacy Edition - A Winner!,"This album never gets old. It always sounds fresh and exciting as it did the day it was released 30 years ago. I purchased this cd for the Disc 2 live Philly show (incomplete show from what I've read, but still very good). The disc 1 material can be found on the previously released remaster. When I put this cd into the cd player, I was happy I made the purchase. All I can say is that the cd sounds great (both discs)! I spent the afternoon listening to this cd and revisiting some other SRV cds. What a great afternoon it was! Like a previous reviewer said, don't get rid of the other remastered Texas Flood. The interview with SRV is on it which is not on the Legacy Edition. Highly recommended."
5,I Love My SRV,The CD came at a reasonable time in delivery and I love SRV with a passion. The CD was in great shape and I enjoy the listening pleasure always. Christine Matthews Psychic Medium.
3,NOTHING NEW HERE FOLKS,"THE LATEST STEVIE RAY VAUGHAN SONY LEGACY RELEASE OFFERS NOTHING NEW FOR THE HARDCORE SRV FAN. DISC 1 SOUNDS THE SAME AS THE LAST REMASTER AND THE ONE BONUS TRACK WAS ALREADY ISSUED ON THE PREVIOUS REMASTER AS WELL. DISC TWO, RECORDED LIVE AT RIPLEY'S MUSIC HALL IN PHILADELPHIA ON OCTOBER 20, 1983 IS ONE OF STEVIE'S BEST CONCERTS EVER BUT IT'S PRESENTED HERE IN EDITED FORM AND IS MISSING FOUR TRACKS, ""LENNY"", ""RUDE MOOD"", ""TELL ME"", AND ""SCUTTLE BUTTIN'"". THE COMPLETE SHOW HAS BEEN AVAILABLE FOR YEARS AS PART OF AN IMPORT BOX SET CALLED ""IN MEMORIUM"". IT CLOCKS IN AT 77:40 WHILE THE SONY LEGACY VERSION CLOCKS IN AT 58:05. SONY CERTAINLY HAS ACCESS TO THE ENTIRE SHOW SO WHY LEAVE OUT FOUR SONGS? THE SOUND QUALITY ON THE COMPLETE VERSION IS BETTER TOO. THE VAUGHAN ESTATE SHOULD CONSIDER DOING A LIVE SRV BOX AND INCLUDE THE COMPLETE LIVE IN TOKYO SHOW AND THE TWO CONCERTS THAT MTV AIRED BACK IN THE DAY. STEVIE DESERVES BETTER AND SO DO THE FANS."
4,Great debut.,"SRV's exploration of the 12-bar blues is wonderful! The boy could GO and he shows it-almost unbelievable playing, especially for an as yet unsigned artist. He is laying the foundation for things to come on this album."
2,"Interpretation, Not Scripture Based","This book was not what I was looking for. I was hoping to see unrecognized scriptural based descriptions of heaven, Christ and the invisable realm, but it seem more fictional, with 2 to 3 scriptures references scattered between between one and two page chapters. I think I would not have been so disappointed if I knew in advance that the book was primarily from the author's imagination."
2,Wrong Color,"Listing photo showed black curtains - but lemon color arrived. Needless to say, I had to return them. I ended up paying for shipping back to vendor - they would not refund. So Amazon/vendor mistake cost me money."
2,"Huge headphones, industrial-strength","i got these headphones after my $150 Bose suffered a broken lead. I had taken such care of my Bose, but slipped one evening and they were GONE. The very thin leads cannot be repaired (the wires are thin as a hair inside). So, in disgust, I wanted heavy-duty phones. These are over-the-top. The wires look like industrial cables, and are very long. The headphones are massive. So, not at all suitable for use when walking about in public (I tried, with the wires all rolled up and in my pocket). The jack itself must weigh as much as my iPod. Sound quality is pretty blah, with a shrill sound to my ears. I use them at home, but would not recommend them."
2,Horridly Uncomfortable,"These are my thoughts after about 24-hours of use.Comfort:These headphones were extremely uncomfortable for me (my hat size is 7 1/8""). I usually don't get headaches, but these managed to give me a headache after 20 minutes, without fail, every time I put them on. Maybe it's circumaural headphones in general for me because even Sony's MDR V150 were infinitely more comfortable (which are universally hated by audiophiles). Instead I bought Beyerdynamic's DT 235 (http://www.amazon.com/beyerdynamic-DT-235-Headphone-White/dp/B001BAKTFO) which are not circumaural, but my ears are small enough so that they basically are.Sound:I'm no audiophile, but the sound quality was excellent to me; even without an amp.Craftsmanship:Fairly well built, it is made of plastic. The biggest cause of concern for me was the thin cord, but the connector was covered in a metal spring contraption, which made it seem very solid."
3,Not bad but my old Bose headphones squash it,"Not bad for the price. Sound is good, but I was hoping for more. My old Bose headphones are 4+ years old (bought them for less than $100) and they sound MUCH better than these. But these are comfortable and the cord is LONG so I can use it watch TV or play video games without waking up people in the house."
3,Weak bottom end,"These cans are fairly comfy, but I noticed a lack of bottom end almost immedaitely compared to my old cans which broke. So of course I opened them up and noticed there was an RC low pass filter on the drivers. Red flag. Apparently AT knows these things are a bit tinny and try to compensate by rolling off some of the top end. so I swapped these drivers out for the drivers in my old cans, and now they sound great. BTW, when I was looking at my drawer dwellers for drivers, I found a pair of AT drivers almost identical to the ones I swapped out, and at least a decade old! Product improvement - not!"
4,good sound but not loud or loud bass for hiphop,sound good but not good bass. they do block out a lot of sound. they are also build good. had mines for about 7 month. and works good
1,"Horrible, do not buy unless you need 'em for a month.","After owning a pair of Skullcandy Hesh headphones with poor sound quality, I decided it was time for an upgrade. The M3Os I bought for myself arrivedlast month.. I plugged them into my laptop and listened to them. I was really impressed. The bass is a huge improvement over the Hesh, going for a sharp, full sound instead of just making your cans thump. The sound quality is great. With my old Hesh, I was missing half the song! The headphones are pretty comfortable, after wearing them for 2 hours straight, I've experienced no discomfort, despite having a ring in my ear cartilage.After a month of GENTLE use, they stopped working. The wire was intact, everything. These are a scam, do not buy!I'm so mad because I feel like I've been scammed! I spent all my spare money on them..."
3,"Good for sound, but...","These earphones are excellent for sound but I was surprised and a bit amazed that there is no way to regulate the loudness on the unit itself. You have to change it on the TV as you go from one TV station to another and on the Tuner/CD player as you need to modify the loudness from CD to CD. For the price of this unit, sound control is a no-brainer. Kept the earphones, but really disappointed in the company for producing such a limited capability in a costly wired product."
2,Sound Problem,"The headphones are very nice and comfortable. However, the sound volume can't be turned up high enough. I understand why they might want them toned down a little, but this is just too much. I was disappointed and I would recommend you find another brand. They need to at least have the volume you get on an iTunes iPod."
3,Not what I Expected.,"Well I own and use earbuds for the most part, not the expensive kind just a decent pair. I wanted over the ear headphones because I wanted great sound with great bass. They turned out not as I expected and I prefer my earbuds to these headphones. They're not too bad but there is no bass and the sound isn't as I had hoped."
4,Great Entry Headphones,"So after reading many reviews decided on these headphones to get my feet wet. I'm an aspiring songwriter and former musician. By no means am I an audiophile so I can't give you detailed specifics on the headphones. What I can tell you and what I was impressed with is the range of sound. With normal headphones you might get good sound or really great volume, but the instruments all blend together. With these headphones I am able to distinctly tell what instruments are being played. The sound comes together very harmoniously without losing there specific identity. So for me that is awesome!!! One downside, they are not as loud as I would like. One review I read said that these headphones would end up being a very expensive venture for him, because if the low end entry level cans sound this good, it only gets better moving up the scale. I concur with that review and already have my eyes on a couple other headphones."
4,Nice headphone sounds.,this is a good headphone. But the ear gets hot if you wear for a long time. IT's sound quality is great though.
5,"Excellent Value, Great Quality","Been using them for 12 hours in a row now (very comfortable). By far the most crisp and clear sounding headphones I've heard for under $50. Last pair of headphones I bought were green and black from walmart and I thought for $50 I would get something decent. Couldn't stand them and after 3 months I decided I needed something new. Had my eye on the M50s but I don't have that much cash, and after I heard these I wouldn't have bought them anyway. Tested out the monsters, beats and bose head phones through friends and family. I think the others charge you mostly for advertising, these sound the same as those (biggest difference for me seemed to be the source, a lot of difference between a crappy computer and a nice audio card).They also work fine in noisy environments, but they aren't noise canceling. Just simple and great quality."
5,Crystal clear.,"These headphones are amazing for studio use. I have not heard clearer sound from a headphone in this price range. I wouldn't recommend these for portable use/regular listening, as the bass is not powerful whatsoever, they don't fold up, and the cord is 11.5 feet long. You can use them that way if you please. I would recommend highly."
4,Extremely crisp.,"These headphones are freaking great if you are mixing, every sound is amazingly razor sharp. The problem is, if you grew up on cheap headphones, the crispness feels like it over-shadows bass guitars and most bass your used to ""feeling"" on cheap phones; if that makes any sense.They aren't kidding when people joke about bass guitars been turned down in respect to most band instruments, these headphones show that. They are that sharp."
5,Record quality.,"These headphones are well worth the money. The sound quality is amazing, when recording you can hear ever detail. Highly recommend them."
4,"Great sound, OK noise cancelation",Music and movies sound great. But on an airplane it does not silence the outside noise 100%. I bought it on sale and was satisfied with it's value.
2,Uncomfortable to wear,"I would give these 5 stars but for the discomfort I experience while wearing them. They feel fine initially, but after a few minutes the pressure applied by the pads becomes irritating. I take them off when the great music no longer compensates for the intensifying headache."
4,"Brilliant crisp sound, a little quiet","For the price, the sound quality is amazing. Perfect mix of trebles and bass, your lows, his and mids. Ive had beats and these are so much better sound quality, beats have so much bass it drowns out the rest of the music and makes the sound very muggy and hard to hear, with these there is a perfect balance so you get a crisp clear but also bassy sound at neccesary points. Only critique where the beats would win is the volume. Beats are very loud whereas if your on an airoplane youll need to turn your device up full but this isnt a big problem, im probably deaf from too many gigs."
3,"Sounds OK, but not very comfortable","I'll confess, I'm disappointed with the Audio-Technica ATH-M30 ""Professional"" headphones. They sound good, but they are too uncomfortable for extended wear. I don't consider myself to have large ears, but the cups are too small/shallow to fit over my ears without deforming them. I will probably return them."
4,Comfortable with great flat response,"These headphones, for the price, are a great deal. They sound great as studio monitor headphones. The response is clean and flat, exactly what I was looking for. Perfect for mixing and audio production."
3,Comfort level is not so great.,"As all the other reviews mentioned, this has some pretty decent sound quality. Not a big audiophile so I can't really go into great details, but generally the quality of the sound is like what all the majority of the reviews say.The downside to these pair of headphones is the comfort. If you have slightly big ears, then these headphones will be very uncomfortable for you. I had these for about a week, and after wearing them for about an hour or less, my left ear will be hurting. I thought the depth of the earpads would've been the same as the M50's that my housemates have, but they're not. So for those with slightly larger ears, I would not recommend these."
5,"Excellent sound, clarity, and noise canceling!!","These headphones are very comfortable and provide excellent sound. Good bass, as well as a balanced sound. The music can not be heard by others, even when turned up to maximum volume."
5,Perfect for Samsung Galaxy Nexus.,"I use this headphone on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus. Cord is a bit long... but minor issue. It probably wasn't designed for portable devices like phones but damn. This together with Power Amp Player :D. Running ICS and Google Play player isn't the best player, so I been through many headphones trying to find that good sound. These headphone got it. Go get it."
4,Great headphones,These are wonderful head phones - light with fantastic sound. The best compliment I have is that would buy them again.
5,I love these!!,"For the price I paid for these, they are amazing. The wire is a bit too long, but thats fixable. Sound quality is great, and they block out the sound of the outside quite well. Really happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend this product."
5,Incredible value,"Never heard better sounding headphones at this price range. In fact, sounds better than a lot of more expensive headphones I've heard. Big fan of these!"
2,Marginal sound and very uncomfortable,"I bought these because I had tried several other headphones, one costing $1500 and could not find a pair that offered good sound and was comfortable. These were inexpensive and the reviews were decent so I figured, what did I have to lose by trying them. The answer to that question is, shipping to and from Amazon.I cannot recommend them, even for $45.00."
4,Incredible sound,"I was really surprised at the quality of sound. They are light and comfortable. After wearing them for a while however, the ears get a bit warm."
4,"Great headphones, but easily broken",The piece you insert into the Ipod or other music device bent really easily. I do not even know what I did. One day they were just bent. The headphones still work.
5,Worth every penny,"Very nice sound. Keeps out the noise while I'm studying in the same room as my wife watching TV, two yappy dogs and various neighborhood sounds. All that I needed and at a very reasonable price."
4,Amazing value for the price.,"For under $50, you really can't do better than this. I recently decided to upgrade to the HD-280s and, upon their arrival, I thought the ATH-M30s sounded remarkably better. These probably won't satisfy you if you're an extreme audiophile, but, if you're looking at this page, that probably doesn't even concern you."
4,good first headphones,"These headphones are great, when you put them on to hear music or something to edit, you can not really hear anything outside of that of the headphones, so it's a great tool to delete those low unwanted hums that you might not have heard without headphones"
5,Fantastic,"Very affordable headphones. They feel very durable and are extremely comfortable for long listening sessions. Highs are crisp, lows aren't too bassy, and with a little EQ tweaking, they sound incredible. Probably the best over/on ear headphones i've ever owned."
4,Great budget headphones that no one talks about,"I've spent a lot of time trying to find a great pair of cheap headphones, and the lists I read almost never mention the ATH-M30's. I've had these headphones for over a year and they still sound great and have shown no wear. There are a couple of things that aren't perfect about these cans, but for the price I think they are some of the best out their. The two main problems I have with the M30's is that the base can be a little underwhelming at times, and that the cord is too long. These are meant to be studio headphones so the cord length is to be expected, but it gets tangled pretty easily and is annoying to deal with. As far is the bass is concerned, these are much lower then beats by dre. but since they are more balanced by simply turning up the headphones a little I get the bass experience that I need"
4,Almost perfect.,"Great sound for its price. I've heard better, but those cans were 4 times the price of these, and the only difference was that they were a bit bassier. But these have very good balance, lo, mid, hi, whatever, everything sounds clear and deep. I can hear the different levels of sounds that are being produced. The 'phones also muffle out outside sound a lot, which is a big plus when I'm going through noisy places. For the price that these are being offered, this is the bargain of the century. A very good buy.I just have one problem with these headphones, and thats the reason why I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars. After a while, my ears feel a bit pinched, maybe because I have big ears and head, but they still pinch my ears.Overall, I urge you to buy these headphones. This is the bargain of the century."
3,Pleased with the sound but not the durability of the pads,"I'm not an audiophile, so I'll defer to those reviews for anyone looking for a sound quality assessment. But I did live with these phones for over a year, and the only way they let me down was the way the outer liner of the ear cushions fell apart all at once; the cup cushion material has a film on it which peeled away in big swaths, and made me feel less great about the phones in general. If I hadn't left them in a hotel room I'd probably still be using them, but in shopping for new 'phones I'm hesitant to get another Audio Technica set due to this one issue. I'd appreciate hearing others' experiences."
3,Good while they Lasted,"I bought these headphones about a year ago after a pair of good-sounding, cheaply built panasonic headphones fell apart. I was definitely impressed out of the box. The bass response was impressively rich and clear. It was after several days of use that i realized the real quality. I heard things with these headphones that I'd never heard in songs that I'd listed to through a myriad of sound producing mediums. Unfortunately about a week ago I realized that I must have blown them out. I now receive crackling instead of bass. The highs and mids still remain quite good and for that reason i will hang on to them instead of scrapping them altogether. Take note that i seem to do this with a lot of mid-quality headphones, despite the fact i do not use them at excessive volumes. I did use them during a bit of amateur recording which may have been the culprit... Regardless more than satisfactory while they lasted, not so much afterward."
2,Audio-Technica ATH-M30 Professional Headphones,"After reading all the reviews I thought that these would be some good headphones for it's price. Except fit really tight on your head. They give me headaches everytime I use them. I ended up just giving them away after a week, and I'm using my iPod headphones now.The sound is good for the price you are paying but there was no comfort when I was wearing them, and that was a huge turn off.I would not recommend these if you are very sensitive or particular about comfort."
4,"Great audio, noise cancellation so-so","Purchased these headphones due to pretty good reviews from both Amazon and tech websites. I am very pleased with the audio quality, especially for the price. I wouldn't recommend the headphones based on noise cancellation, however. This isn't a huge surprise, since these are a fraction of the price of the high-end noise cancelling headphones so don't let it be a deal-breaker if you are primarily looking for a good-sounding pair of headphones at a manageable price."
5,Audi=Techno Headphones,Ourchased as a gift for a gamer who is delighted with the audio quality and comfortof the equipment. They are serving their intended purpose well.
4,Nice headphone,"My first impressions.The sound quality is really good, I have listened a few different genres (classical, rock, live concert), they all sounded really well. And, it still hasn't burned in yet, so, I am expecting even better performance later on.The bads (resulting in a star loss). The design. It is not collapsible (unline Sony's MDR-V6 model), if you try to collapse it, you may break it, so be careful. Secondly, it is more like supra-aural rather than circumaural, hence, it doesn't isolate from the outside very well. I think it is worse than MDR-V6 in that aspect. But, I feel it sounds better than MDR-V6."
5,Great sounding and robust headphones,These headphones are the best bargain that u can get for a low price. The sound quality is excellent(which you can always expect from audio technica) and are also very comfortable..they are not at all flimsy( i have dumped them ino my bags during air travel but still u cannot find a scratch on them). The only poblem that i faced is the long cable which makes it quite messy at times..but considering the pros these headphones are a must buy!!!
5,Wonderful Headphones,"After reading many reviews of various headphones, I chose these headphones. They work wonderfully. I'm very pleased. I recommend these headphones to everyone."
3,Great sound but uncomfortable,Sound 5/5. I really loved the sound of these headphones. Listening to my favorite tracks with these was like listening to them for the first time. One minor nit was that on some songs the base seemed a little undefined.Comfort 1/5. I wear glasses and even after 1/2 hour my ears would be getting crushed. I bought these to that I could have music at work all day so this just does not work for me and I will have to return them. It is too bad I really love how well they sound.
2,"Average quality, if the price was higher, the reviews would be lower.","I bought these headphones after reading many other reviews. But I think I was misguided by them. The sound quality is not so high, and they are not that comfortable. If the other reviewers had had to pay double the price, would their reviews still be as good as they are? Probably not. I was looking for quality sound, period. Not quality sound in relation to the pricetag. I compared the sound against my other much simpler and cheaper headphones, and there was hardly a difference.The lack of quality in this item is simply forgiven by the other reviewers because they were not that demanding, because they hadn't paid much for it. Oh, and the headphones are hardly sound isolating."
2,Quality in everything but the speakers!!! Bad news.,"I was so impressed when I opened this product. It was obvious that high quality products were used all over these headphones, the best and longest plug- in cord ever and then I plugged them in and hit play...OY!These speakers are low rent big time. The sound quality is so bad and the range so restricted I thought my stereo had malfunctioned! I hooked up my Farm & Fleet clearance $19.95 specials and found the maifunction is in these poor quality speakers.BAD.If they replace the speakers these are first class."
2,a $40 headphone...dont get for ipod or phone,"Got the headphones, plugged them into my phone and they didnt work unless i pushed down on the jack. Not worried about not working on my phone as im only using them for messing around on sound board. Once I was home I put the adapter on and used them on the sound board. Here's my pro and consPROS-Awesome fit. Very comfortableCONS-SOUND LIKE CRAP! unless you have a headphone amp they will most likely be useless to you if you like loud music..No bass response what so ever..my headphones i got with my phone are better"
2,"Great Headphones, bad retailer","I received these headphones today and they are everything that I expected after reading plenty of reviews and hearing only good things. However, after initially being seduced by an attractive price of $50.93, these headphones have cost me around $85.00.This is because I live in Canada, and was forced to pay the overpriced duties and similar fees of shipping company 'DHL EXPRESS' that is set as default by retailer 'Audiosavings'. If you live outside of the USA, I suggest you do your research to find the cheapest way of having the product shipped to you, then requesting that Audiosavings choose your preferred method of shipping, or consider another retailer all together."
4,"Great Headphones, Long Cord","Great headphones. Great sound quality, though the cord is really long. Great for musicians? but cumbersome for regular use. I would give this 5 stars if the cord wasn't so long. Looks to be solidly made."
1,POOF!,I have had these for about a year. I also have M35.POOF! no sound! I have never had a pair of headphones to go out completely. Some had shorts in the wire. Some fizzled. Never POOF! No Sound!
1,Sound cuts out.,Disappointed in this product. I listened for about 10 minutes and the sound was cutting out- there may be a short in the cable. Totally unacceptable and now I have the hassle of having to return them. Even if the sound didn't cut out I'm not sure about these. The pads feel cheap and I doubt they would be comfortable or long lasting. I would steer clear of these headphones.
3,Pro Headphones? I think not!,These headphones are not worth the price it was sold for. They sound good but professional? That's a real reach. A price like $25.00 would be fair and honest. I kept them but sorry I didn't return them now after seeing what other headphones that are better go for..I got ripped off.
4,Great sound and great price,"When at work I like to listen to news and podcasts, and the inner-ear buds always seem to give me a headache after a while. I want something that would fit over my ears comfortably and not interfere. These are great.Don't expect booming bass that shakes your head, but sound is crisp and clear.The cord is insanely long, and while I sit at my desk with my computer or phone in front of me - I could see this being useful in some sort of a studio setup where you move around a lot.Would buy again."
4,audio-techniica M30 headphones,"Audio-Technica has an excellent reputation in the headphone industry. The phones are quite comfortable and I have worn them for up to 6 hrs. without fatigue. The extra length 10 ft cord has a strain relief at both plug and phone end, and I can reach from the receiver to my easy chair without using an extension. Sound is natural, not overly bright, but it is lacking a bit of bass."
4,It is good!,"It sounds very comfortable and is higher quality just the appearance are not so beautiful some others. I am not a professional one, it is valuable for me to use on subway!"
5,Amazing.,"The most amazing headphones, ever. The quality, amazing. The bass, amazing. Everything, AMAZING. The price, aha, amazing. Buy them, you won't regret it."
3,volume too low,I our purchased these headphones based on previous experience with this brand but the sound quality was not very good. Very low volume even when turned up to the max.
3,sound great but don't feel great.,Great sounding headphones. One complaint is the ear pads are very thin and extended use irritates my ear. Also they don't seal out noise very well. The Sony v6's are more comfortable and more efficient power wise.
1,Not loud enough.,headphones are comfortable and lightweight.but the sound quality is very quiet and low.these do not have noise cancelling at all.
4,Work very well,This noise reduction headset worked as stated and were very comfortable. They were a great option for a very reasonable price.
4,Great sound but not what I was looking for,"In my search for the ""right headphones"" I researched a few brands like sony, and sennsiher..don't know the speeling, anyhow I noticed good reveiws on these headphone so I jumped on them. My motiive for getting these were that I thought they would have a good bass response which I did not know wsa not the case. The sound is great don't get me wrong but not what I was looking for. I sent them back the next day to order the ATH-WS55i which are the solid bass model which comes with a microphone and i-phone controller. these were also ordered from amazon and they came in ""3 days"" directly from Japan. these were exactly what I was looking for because it kept the same great sound as a m30's with even more treble and great higs but the lows was what was the gift. so if you can afford to pay more for some good headphones go for ws55model"
5,Great Quality,"I bought these headphones because I was looking for a pair to plug into my old receiver that has a 1/4 inch jack. Initially intended to listen to my records, I have actually been using them on my laptop and mp3 player. For $40 this deal was beyond what I thought it would be. Great buy and I would recommend them to everyone."
4,Great Headphones for the Price,"Well, I'm on my second pair of these headphones...I lost the first one. The fact that I chose to buy the same pair again should say something about how I feel about them, though. I'm not a hardcore audiophile, but I think the quality of sound and construction is pretty unbeatable at this price for this form factor. They're a little bulky, but I can't really fault the headphones that much...think it's kind of just the nature of circumaural headphones. My only real complaint is that the cord is sort of ridiculously long...some people seem to think this is a positive attribute, but for the way that I use headphones, it just sort of gets in the way."
3,Squeezed my brain case,"These headphones are HUGE. Very bulky and the style is more utilitarian than aesthetically pleasing. The real problem was they squeezed my head such that I started to get a headache 30 minutes in. I wear a large size hat, so maybe my head was too big? So I returned them.Those flaws aside, the sound quality was great and the headphones well-constructed. I could see them being quite durable in a professional environment where they get banged around a bit. If they hadn't squeezed my brain case so much, I would have gladly kept them, bulk and all."
2,Okay sound but no isolation,"I tried three different headphones:Sennheiser 280 ProSound was very good, especially after some burn-in. But VERY uncomfortable. Way to tight -- really clamp down hard on your head. This produces great isolation, and they're well built, but this is useless if you can't wear them. Note: I don't have a big head.Audio Technica ath-m30The sound on these was just okay, and they sit on the ear (not around the ear), so they don't isolate well at all. They are more comfortable than the 280s and much lighter, but they also feel a little weird (being on the ear), and I don't know why anyone would buy closed headphones that don't isolate.Shure SRH440I think these sound the best. Maybe not quite as clear as the Senns, but they are more dynamic. They feel less like the sound is in a tin can. The sound feels closer. They are very well made. Probably the best made of the bunch. And they are comfortable. Not as tight as the Senns and isolate almost as well, certainly well enough."
3,Very good but not great,"UPDATED 09/26/2012Pros:The bottom line is that these headphones are very good. The sound quality is superb. Very clear and crisp sound with these. The bass leaves a bit to be desired. I run these through the HIFIMAN EXPRESS HM-101.Cons:Here is where the but comes in. I do not recommend these for sound isolation if you have larger ears. They sat on my ears more so then around them and this caused them to be useless for sound isolation. Another issue that came of them sitting on my ears is that my ears began to hurt after using them for 1 hour or more.Conclusion:These would be a good 3.5-4 on my book if they weren't so uncomfortable. Saying that, my next shot at a nice set of headphones will be in the Sennheiser HD448. I tried the Sennheiser HD448 for a bit and had similar issues with comfort as the ATH-M30. I ended up with a set of Sennheiser HD598 headphones and love them, would highly recommend the HD598 if you are willing to spend the dough on them."
3,Great headphones,"After reading reviews for these headphones, I though I might just have to give these little guys a try. After receiving these bad boys in the mail, I was instantly pleased with the high quality these headphones truly are. They do no feel plastic nor cheap in any sense what so ever. With a thick long flexible cord only adds to the greatness of these headphones.Although the build quality is super, the comfort wasn't so much. After wearing them for about 30 or more minuets a day, they start to feel really uncomfortable. To the point I was forced to leave them off for an hour or so, before the un-comfortableness caused by the headphones returned back to normal.Build quality - 9/10Sound quality - 10/10Comfort - 4/10"
4,Good Sound,Good headphones but not the best sound quality. But great for the price compared with some other brands they have a crisp sound.
5,Good Price Good Quality,Very good sound so far. Only had a week though to use them so I can not guarantee persistance my friends.
4,ATH-M30 Headphones,"I bought these after reading reviews and shopping for a set of mid-priced, flat-response headphones that I could carry with me (to avoid damaging my more expensive ones which I keep at home). I teach audio production and was also looking for a set that I could recommend to students that are on a budget. These work well for the price, seem to be accurate (at least, moving from mixing in a DAW to near-field monitors) and cut out a reasonable amount of room noise. I wouldn't mix with these in an environment that was too noisy, as they aren't very loud and although they function well (as closed-back) they just aren't as isolating as more expensive headphones. Reasonably good and reliable so far."
1,"After less a month, one side no longer has sound","I purchased this because of the reviews online. After less than one month, the right side stopped working completely. Even cheaper ones I have worked longer. This is very disappointing."
3,I don't get what all the hype was about.,"I was looking for a good pair of on ear headphones and I decided to go with the M30's based on my previous experiences with the brand and customer reviews.I used the headphones for less than 24 hours. I wasn't impressed with the sound quality but it was decent overall, for $44 why complain? I listened to many different generes of music even watched a movie on my laptop. They started to feel uncomfortable after having them on for an hour or so, not unbearable but definitely uncomfortable. Then I started to notice that the right ear was cutting in and out, I figured it mightve been the audio jack from the device I was listening to. I tried it on several different devices and it was still cutting in and out. Probably recieved a defective unit, but it was enough for me to return them.If you're looking for a decent pair of on ear headphones for seldom use, go for it. Other than that, I don't recommend these."
3,My Old 9 year old Sony MDR-V600's are better.,"I bought new headphones because I thought there was something wrong with them, seems its just my computers fault... My old MDR-V600's are definitely better.. I can hear all the individual sounds.. These headphones sound flat.. and like everything is mashed together... good deal for $50 but my decade old Sony's are better."
4,"Excellent sound, good price","Got these to replace my Sennheiser EH-150 that are dead after 2-3 years of regular use on computer. I'm extremely satisfied with my new Audio-Technica ATH-M30. Overall sound is better than my former Sennheiser's. Natural and balanced sound, well defined and spacious from bass to high treble. Every note is so clear, just enjoy listening to music with these! Light enough and comfortable. Practical long cord. I'm very happy with these, just hope they gonna last long!"
3,Good sound ruined by poor design,"These are the cheaper versions of the M50s, and for good reason: sound and comfort are definitely a step down. However, they are pretty good and have big bass like the M50s without being overpowering. My ears really started overheating though, and the M50s do not seem to have that problem at all. Also, the straight cable is waaaaaayy too long. It's just ridiculous why anyone would make such a long cable. And it's not even removable so you could put in a shorter one.It's pretty unfortunate because these actually sound really good (I LOVED the sound), but I can't get past the overheating and cable length problems: I'm sending these back. Get the M50s, they are the best I've ever bought. Try getting the coiled version if you can, they'll be totally worth it then."
4,Good quality for the price.,"The sound is good, specially in the bass part of the audio band. I'd recommend this product to anyone looking for a pair of headphones for a daily ordinary use."
5,really great cans,really rich sounding headphonesnot noise cutting but when you have them on they do some greatsound cancellingbought for a podcast studio very goodI love thema must buy
1,Unlucky customer,"I ordered this headset last week with another Panasonic one for my wife and both supposed to arrive in one package. 4 days ago, it said that package delivered, but Ive keept checking my mailbox and around my house and still nothing... tried to call carrier but useless :( just wasting..."
1,What a waste of money,"These things are terrible. They sound terrible, the wire is at least 900 ft long, they're extremely cheap, I won't be buying something from audio-technica again. Don't waste your money, pay 10 extra dollars for some decent Sony Extra Basses."
1,Horrible Headphones.,"These headphones were horrible. When they came out of the packaging, the connecting wire was already flawed. Sound only played from one side, or the other, depending on how you twisted the jack. I never could get both sides to play at once. The comfort was very bad, made my ears hurt, and was scratchy.For the price, these were a rip-off. I would have sent them back, but I ended up ripping them apart because after a gaming session where I could not hear anything and I simply lost it. Nobody should suffer these on their head."
1,DEFECTIVE,"So I get my belly button ring, and guess what? it was tinyyyyy and also when i tried it on the first time one of the LITTLE balls broke... yes it broke when i was trying to put it back, It was not even in completly so it was not tight.... Bad bad product"
3,Closing chapter,"Not as ""real"" as Season one, Freshman Year. In fact, the episodes were a bit too unbelievable. Characters and plots were too ""Hollywood."""
3,Not in great condition.,"The product was missing the cover jacket and it looks like the DVD set was not perfect to begin with. The Felicity front and back cover looked like it was printed with a computer that ran out of ink. Although it was not a fake, it was not the quality promised."
2,Felicity Senior Year,The box sourrounding the DVDs was all beat up and looked like it had been dropped on all sides.
5,If you buy Felicity: Senior Year you won't be disappointed!,"I have watched ""Felicity"" since the show first aired. Honestly, since it's series finale I can't put my finger on what makes me watch the previous seasons over and over on DVD.I agree with most watchers that there is something about the show that makes you feel like they are ""real"" characters and you feel like they are part of your lives. The characters portray real-life subjects and probably things that most have us have already been through or are going through in our lives.I think that is what makes this television show so special. Since ""Felicity"" I have not found a show that I can relate to as I did with this one. I don't know if it was the fact that I was going through college the same time as the Felicity was on the show or if it was that I could relate to each character to someone in my own life. Whatever it may be...""Felicity"" is one of those shows that are ""unforgettable."""
3,Senior Year.....Felicity is Out of Here,"Not as much fun or as interesting as previous seasons.....but a nice wrap up to a wonderfully written series. The last 6 or so episodes of the season are very out-of-the-blue for this show, and not my cup of tea, but I do not let it diminsih my enjoyment of all of the shows and seasons that came before."
1,never received purchase!,It is now a couple of weeks past expected delivery date (and well over 1 month since order) and I still have not received this item...or any response to my emails to seller.
5,just watch the concert,"You can't base your opinion about this album, just by listening to it..you've got to watch the live performance, it's absolutely magnificent. You get to experience such an emotional power put upon all the music.. I think that's what makes this album so great: the way Jobim, Gal and the others give themselves to their sound, it's all just so true, so natural.. Jobim's performance on Luiza made me sit still from the first note till the very last one faded.. and I'm afraid since I listened (and watched) to it, I was nevermore able to enjoy another version, althoug I recognize that, for instance, Chico Buarque's one is quite good.. but there's no way anyone will ever love that song as Jobim did, and he let it all out so truthfully that we might as well just love the man and his legacy, which includes this wonderful encounter.. Well, buy it if you want to feel it; don't, if you're planning on examining the work until the last detail.."
3,Not as nice as some of the other numbers,"I recently received my order of a Flora & Fauna HN9 Hand Carved Address Plaque Number Nine. I have received many compliments from my neighbors on the sleek and stylish new addition to my trailer. However, I am not *completely* satisfied with my purchase.The ""9"" features a single line, curved from the middle up into a loop, then back down, across the beginning point, and curving again around the bottom. It looks very much like an upside-down ""6."" Maybe its a little understated for my tastes, but I really like the style with which Flora and Fauna carved their ""8,"" which consists of two closed loops atop each other, and also their fanciful and indecisive ""3,"" which wants so badly to be an ""8"" but just can't close the deal!Perhaps I will trade lots with my buddy, who lives on 38. For me, stuck on lot 9, at least for now, I will be only moderately satisfied with my purchase."
3,missing my favorite song,"This CD was ok. The instrumentals are a bit slurred.I fell in love with the song she's a gunand decided to buy the CD looking forward to similar songs, but there was nothing just like it and the song I wanted wasn't on the CD. My bad for not making sure, I don't know where I'd be able to find it because it's not on this CD"
3,not bad,"I am a big fan of the Doves, and was thrilled to see that they put out a DVD. The videos are quite nice, so are the extras. However the live footage was quite dissapointing. Too many camera angles almost made me dizzy. It really doesn't have the ""feel"" like you are in the audience. Maybe its just me, but I don't need cameras swooping in and out to enjoy the performance. It felt like an MTV video or something... however the band played wonderfully. Just be warned, this is not a very candid live set."
5,Please support Yuri/Shoujo ai,"This was my first yuri anime and i must say that it is so far one of the most memorable in my mind. I hope that all Strawberry panic fans pick up the dvds, manga, and light novel that are being release. The more we support SP the more merchandise we will get here in the U.S. and we can only hope that maybe we can get a 2nd season of SP!!"
1,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"i've never let an anime title's genre sway my judgement. be it action/adventure, mystery, mecha, horror, or in this case yuri, a good show is a good show. THIS IS NOT A GOOD SHOW. i thought maybe this was one of those series that starts out slow and gets better as it goes. i was mistaken. i have never been so thoroughly unentertained by an anime title. the plot is uninspired, the characters uninteresting, and the sporadic attempts at humor fail soundly. if you're having trouble sleeping i suggest popping this one in the dvd player. you'll be out in under 15 minutes."
5,A great running account of the Civil War,"This is Bruce Catton's third book in his Civil War Trilogy - no doubt this is one of his best. This volume covers the war from Fredericksburg to the surrender at Appomattox, and finally the assassination of Lincoln. Catton's approach in this book is generally the higher level strategy and the politics of the war. In many ways, it is a President's approach to the war, as Catton explains the actions of both President Davis and Lincoln. The most amazing aspect of this volume is Catton's smooth, running account of all events of this war, fought on various fronts and parts of the country. A tough literary feat, and Catton does it superbly in this book!I received a first addition, like the one pictured here. It is in pretty good conditioned, I am pleased to get a ""collectable"" if it can be classified as one."
1,"ANDREW TRAUCKI, OPUS 2","From time to time, I get fooled by a trailer. And, each time, after a disappointing experience, I also always solemnly swear that I won't get fooled again. So, The Reef here is my last disappointment. Infantile dialogues and shots of the deep blue sea characterize it. It seems that the director used here real sharks but they are not scary at all. However, I understand the actors who refused to swim in the company of a great white shark. Instant crap."
1,Unbelievable,"This movie is unbelievably terrible! The acting is atrocious. If I could give it zero(0)stars, it would be overrated. Quite simply, the worst movie I've ever seen!!!!!"
3,REEF MADNESS,"If you've seen OPEN WATER or OPEN WATER 2, you've seen THE REEF. Based on a true story that has little to do with this script, THE REEF pits six friends against a hungry killer shark. The film is done well, admirably eschewing CGI sharks for the real thing which does up the suspense ratio. One by one, the brave victims try to swim to safety. THE REEF is well acted and has a couple nail-biting segments. If sharks are your cup of tea, you might like THE REEF."
2,reef,"There are so many ways a director can scare the hell out of you with sharks. And this director fell short. The story had great potential but the way it was filmed was just boring. I never jumped once, now come on a shark move an you don't jump. What the what?"
2,disapointed,I couldn't believe I paid that much money for this. I will never buy another product like this again. I feel ripped off.
4,Wonderful Toy,I've always loved miniatures and had bought this and the bird feeder set. These are quality toys and well last a long time. Whether you're buying this for a child or an adult they well be very pleased and delighted at receiving such a fun toy.I hope to add more to my collection. And when my niece is older I well surely be buying these for her as well.I gave it three stars because it does not have much in the set. I was a little disappointed that there weren't more vegetables or a food bowl. But over all it's delightful I love the little bunnies and the farmers snap on hat is a fun detail.
1,watching paint dry,"This book seems to go on and on and on and on...and get nowhere, not her best. Cranford was readable this just ploughed on, on on you gete the picture!"
4,"If You Like Austen, Try This Book","This book reminded me of Mansfield Park by Jane Austen, but it wasn't nearly as good. Molly, a quiet and shy young lady who never asserts herself, reminded me of Fanny while Roger seemed like Edward, the second son of an important man who falls for the wrong woman. Despite the similarities, this book was very different from Austen's work, and it wasn't nearly as good. It was looong, and the parts in between the action were, well, rather boring. I didn't enjoy this book nearly as much as I had hoped, but I did finish it. However, if you love Jane Austen, you may want to try this book since it is written similarly."
5,Highly Recommended!,"This is a wonderful book! What a find. It was a rare treat and a free treat, to boot! The characters are well done. Gaskell is compared to Jane Austen and no doubt they appeal to the same reader. But I particularly enjoyed the strong female main character in this book and in North and South. Gaskell Molly (Wives and Daughters) and Margaret (North and South) are somehow more substantial individuals even than some Austen ladies. Do see theThe Elizabeth Gaskell Collection (Wives and Daughters / Cranford / North and South)which Amazon sells. They are delightful."
4,"Great Story, but SO many typos!","I really enjoyed this book. The story was very engaging, and the characters were all so interesting and well-developed. But this particular version has so many spelling/punctuation errors that it was quite distracting.I realize that it was a free version, so I am not upset about all the mistakes, but I would recommend investing a few dollars in another version if you do not have the patience to try to figure out what the words are probably supposed to be."
4,Another Favorite,"Ordered book by mistake, wanted DVD; decided to keep & read & as always with Gaskell, I truly enjoyed it. Was glad I read book 1st as with Austen's work. Because of the era it pre-explained and filled in areas in the movie that had questions. I did enjoy book more than DVD; but the visual was just great. I enjoy British / English movies of this period and it holds your interest while stirring multiple emotions. It was Gaskell's last and unfinished which is obvious in the ending only in DVD & only if you have followed the books from beginning. The book is a must. You will enjoy"
4,Could not put it down,"I watched the television adaptation of ""Wives and Daughters"" and loved it so I decided to read the book on kindle (it was free, does not get better than that). I was glad I did since I got to understand the characters so much better. In my opinion,the only downside to the novel was the ending. I'm glad I saw the television adaptation first since it gave me a sense of closure even though the book leaves the reader to make your own conclusions as to what would have happened between Molly and Roger. All in all a great novel. Highly reccommended."
5,Gaskell-a keen observer of human foibles,"If you like Jane Austen, you will probably like ""Wives and Daughters"". This may be Gaskell's wittiest book. She let's her character's tell the story through their own selfish, or honest, or naiive, or manipulative actions. The beautiful and brilliant Cynthia is really the star of this tale-her self-centered mother is the machinating demon, wrekeing havoc with domestic tyrany.A handsome, successful widower with daughter marries a pretty, winning widow with daughter, and all hell breaks loose. One of the greatest little stories ever told!"
3,I wouldn't have begun reading if I knew this was an Unfinished Work,"I am left hanging of the cliff of resolution!This is an amazing book so thorough and realistic in its details, while at the same time having a pleasant moral strain. It is a lot like Jane Austen only less satirical.All in all I recommend it just know that you will find no happy ending, or ending of any kind!"
5,A leisurely stroll through an English village ; great read!,"Mrs. Gaskell is the perfect author for avid Jane Austen fans. Here is humor, ""quiet suspense"", and in-depth characterization. For those of us who like to lose ourselves in the bucolic life of daily 19th-century England, this book is a treat! Another similar title equally satisfying is ""Framley Parsonage"" by Anthony Trollope."
2,didn't finish story,she didn't finish the story. after writing a long story she cut it off before it was ended in the middle of the wrapping up. it was like she was only going to write so many words and not a word more. other then that the story was good.
4,Decent...especially when you can get them for cheap,"These fake plants look better than most you can find at pet stores for twice the money. My only complaint with them is that they have the same problems as many fake aquarium plants. The stems of the plants tend to detach a bit too easily when putting them in your tank, so often when cleaning the tank, a stalk will come floating to the surface and has to be re-attached.That complaint I have had with most of the many fake plants I have purchased, no matter how much I have spent, so I wouldn't say this is a bad product, especially for the price range."
4,The Rifleman Goes To Italy..,"Chuck Connors, the next best thing to John Wayne, starring mostly in television series like the Rifleman, Branded, this time Connors travels to Italy to make this spaghetti western, ""Kill Them All and Come Back Alone"", sets the stage for a good plot, plenty of gunplay, acrobatics and good fight choreography as you watch Chuck Connors and genre actor Frank Wolff slug it out as both men are searching for the dynamite stolen by Connors and his men, nothing short of action and adventure this one delivers the goods, and may be one of the most original of the genre, also any chance to see Chuck Connors is worth the price of admission, Connors only made a few full length western movies, and Kill Them All and Come Back Alone is presented in 16x9 widescreen featuring an interview with actor/stuntman, Ken Wood."
3,Very Average,"I bought this movie not long after viewing the Rifleman Mega Pack. The Mega Pack contains 80 Rifleman episodes. About half of them are very good. With Kill Them All and Come Back Alone, I expected to see an intense Chuck Connors in a classic thriller western. However, Chuck seemed to be going through the motions and the movie seemed low budget. I would not recommend it unless you are really a big Chuck Connors fan."
1,Not suitable for any animal,"This cage is falsely advertised. This is FAR too small for ANY animal. I would not put a mouse in it let alone a hamster. The water bottle has no ball and drips if the cage is moved at all. It is frustrating to put together and take apart. Pieces fall off of these things. For your money you can get a MUCH better brand than this, and much bigger too. Researching what housing is good for your pet is always important. I only use this as a carrier."
2,Mice can chew to freedom!,"It is very cute but has a couple of design flaws, and the same goes for all crittertrail products. a determined mouse such as mine can chew off any bits of plastic that are jutting out, such as the pieces that the metal bars slot into. thinking it was the small size upsetting her, i bought a tunnel and a burrowing cage, but she chews the hinges off the top of the burrow. as a result, i have covered the inside of the bars with cardboard and duct tape, and sealed off the parts of the cage she can escape from at night, such as the top compartment of the burrow. also i haven't seen her drink from the bottle once, so i have to put jar lids on the floor for her to drink from. she seems happier since I boarded things up, but we'll see what tonight brings. if you have a contented mouse, these are great fun, and a good purchase since you can expand on it as much as you like. but if you have a chewer, spend your money on a simpler tougher cage."
3,"Do NOT buy from B&J Pets and Aquariums, Inc. !!!!","Firstly the cage is okay, not great at all. The tube access covers don't fit properly and are easy for hamsters to remove, we had to tape the covers in place. The bottom tray is too low and quickly leads to a mess surrounding the cage. It does the job and is astatically pleasing; except for the tape I had to put on the tube cover. A solid three star product, nothing to brag about.My main issue is with B&J; Pets and Aquariums, Inc. who are selling USED as new. The cage I received was clearly a return that had an animal in it before. Old bedding fell out of the box soon as I opened it, as well as there being small scratches on the base from an animal trying to dig. (Amazon won't let me post review of the seller since they use an Amazon warehouse, so I am posting it here.) Not worth returning, but I am not happy about buying a new product only to receive a USED one."
4,Perfect for small hamster!,"I love this habitat, and so does my Roborovski dwarf Hamster. It's small enough for her and has enough ports to add all of her tubes. The handle is very handy for traveling! The only downside I've noticed with this product is that with excessive use of tube removal the tabs and the wheel thing can, and do, break. Not a deal breaker to me, stuff breaks when you over use it. I threw the wheel away and bought a new one.Super Pet CritterTrail Snap-On Comfort Wheelwe bought is way quieter, cheap, and more fun anyway.Habitat arrived promptly and in excellent condition."
2,Small cage,I got this cage along with my fancy hamsters but the cage was way to small! So I switch the cage and put my dwarf Chinese hamster. But it was stilll to small u cant put much inside the cage. I don't like the bottle that goes through the top to have it hang inside.As far as cleaning you take everything apart it is easy.. Putting parts back is ok..The cage wld work if u just put in a food dish. And add nothing else... And just put a smaller hamster would fit not fancy hamsters.
5,SOULFUL AND SEXY! I LOVE THEM!,THIS CD IS AWESOME! THE SONG 'BREATHE EASY' IS SO BEAUTIFUL! GO WATCH THAT MUSIC VIDEO ONLINE. IT IS CINEMATIC!!! THEY ARE SO SEXY AND TALENTED!
5,Excellent,What pop should be. This group is welcome relief to the bleak music landscape. The harmonies are incredible.
4,"Heavy, Heavy Duty","As a salesperson at Home Depot, I get to use most every tool we sell. When it comes to cordless drills, this Milwaukee has the longest run-time and highest power of any we carry, save for the higher-end 24v systems, which are prohibitively heavy. It will drive lag screws all day, it seems, with no trouble at all. Just be sure to hold on tight. It drives lags faster than the newer impact drivers on the market that produce super-high torque ratings at the expense of speed. The all-metal keyless chuck is great to have, the keyless chucks with plastic grips tend to wear out quickly if they rub against anything while drilling. This drill's only downfall is its weight. I personally purchased one based on my experience at work, but there are drills out there that are easier to handle. I wouldn't want to use it sheetrocking a ceiling, but if I were building a deck, using 4x4s, lags, timberloks, etc. this would be the one cordless I'd pick."
5,Painted Ponies,Absolutely wonderful!! One of the best Carousel books out there. The photos are just amazing. Great reading also. A must have for any carousel enthusiasts.
2,Waste of money for me,"I've used other postcard forms and they worked fine. Maybe it's the weight of the paper on this one, but it wouldn't feed through my printer's feed AT ALL. Okay, one sheet fed through. I feel like I just threw that money away, and it was going to be for marketing postcards for my book. Doesn't work on Brother multifunction units. Don't spend the money."
3,"Works fine, while it lasts","Attractive clock runs on one AA battery and keeps good time, while it lasts. Ours lasted little over 1 year, which is not long enough for me. I'll be shopping for a different brand."
3,Keeps decent time,"It's not quite the color they showed it to be. But, it is attractive enough and keeps reasonable time. I have to adjust it, occasionally, but it was reasonably priced and I like it."
3,"Geneva/Advance 10"" Wall-Clock","The Advance battery-operated 10"" Wall-Clock works fine, looks OK EXCEPT one problem. The ticking Seconds is loud enough to DISTURB a person with normal hearing. It will be better is the second-hand just moves smoothly WITHOUT making Tick-Tick sound."
2,Cheap,"Makes too audible of a ""click"" noise each second. We ended up putting it n the bathroom where it's not so annoying."
5,"Good stuff, works well, easy to apply","I live in MN and have an older house. One of the windows I have not replaced suddenly wouldn't close all the way no matter what I tried.I used this stuff to caulk approx a 1/8in hole all the way around the window a couple of days ago (had ice on the window etc). It seems to have cured great despite the cold air and some melting ice water getting on it. The draft is sealed and the window isn't leaking air anymore....so far this stuff is working great.If I could give it a 4.5 I would, it says clear but hazy is more like it (I gave it a 5 I'm certainly more worried about performance then looks), still great stuff and I'm impressed with it."
4,okay,My daughter loved this her hampster could go on sleepovers to grandmas with her. but the hampster chewed through it any way. great for the money but thoughs animals can just chew through anything.
3,reading level,"I was expecting a higher reading level. This is preprimer, not middle reading level. I would say the search engine on the website is not accurate."
2,"Ummm, not really what we expected.","This is an odd version of the Nutcracker to target toward emerging readers. I would not have purchased this book for such young children had I known the images were going to be quite this graphic. Plus, it did not provide very good reinforcement of the Nutcracker story we saw on stage, as Clara's name is different in this version and several other facts my children know from the more traditional story were changed as well. My children left this book feeling more confused and overwhelmed than anything else. Sorry, but I cannot recommend it."
3,What happened to Clara?,"This is a nice book and the story is simple but seems true to the classic story, however, I'm bugged by the fact that the main character is named Marie not Clara. I'm not a nutcracker expert but I know that much. Also Amazon's title say Step 2 but it is really a step 3 book."
5,Worth it,"This toy was purchased for a party with several kids from 2 to 12 years old. They all loved it! Not only did it last through heavy use at the party, but it still lives in a little girls room. Well loved!"
2,Just a cardboard house,"My 2 year old enjoys playing in the house, but the thresholds (1 inch wide cardboard strip) broke within 1 week which destabilized the house. after 1 and a half months of playing, it toppled over yesterday. I don't know how the other reviewer could get 2+ years of use out of it. the bottom line is that it is a cardboard house and you are paying just that. and the markers stained my child's hands. it took couple washings to it off."
1,Cardboard Box,"Waste of money. We put it together, even started coloring it in... when it was set in the playroom, it looked like crap. LOL. We tore it down and put it in the recycling bin. Lesson learned.... don't buy a house of cardboard! lol"
5,My niece loves it,"I think the people a couple reviews down are confusing this playouse with something else.I gave this very same playhouse to my niece, Amanda, 2 years ago (she was 3) and she still plays with it! Am buying another one to keep at my house for when she comes over.It has held up through tons of sleepovers, ""tea parties"" and decorating. It's still one of her favorite toys."
2,Cute but not worth the money,"We got this for our daughter and it's cute but for the price, you can make your own! The wings that keep the roof connected wore down very quickly so the roof doesn't stay in place. They say it's easy to store and break down, which it is, but the wings and base of the house got frayed quickly by trying to store it. We also didn't take into consideration how big it is - I would definitely look at the dimensions of this to figure out where to place in in your home."
5,Fun Fun and more Fun,"My kids are calling this the BEST playhouse. They have been playing in it for hours. The markers that come with it are durable, the pieces were easy to assemble. My kiddos are 8, so I hoped they would love it and they do. Thank you!"
4,Rainy Day Fun,"As a grandparent I purchased this for my 4 year old grandson and 16 month old granddaughter. They were visiting for a week and naturally we had two days of rain.They both had a great time with the play house. My grandson was all about coloring it and my granddaughter just wanted to stick her head in and out of the windows and door and gather all of her stuffed ""friends"" in there with her. We were surprised at just how big the house was.I do recommend as others have to tape the house once assembled. It will make it studier. We did not do that because I wanted to be able to put it away until the next trip.My daughter may very well end up getting the castle for home."
1,Hiroshima Revisionist History (again),"Biased, poorly researched book related to the boombing of Hiroshima. The bias begins on the dust cover (insinuating that Truman knew this would be the start of the Cold War). The book goes downhill from that point. selecting the low estimates of US losses and providing a revisionist view of the bombing (guess what--the Japanese approach to existance where the country supercedes self was real hence kill the 'Round Eye' who are invading our country) and would have resulted in horrible US losses. As is often true about revisionist history, no real attempt is made to project what would have happened if the war draged on and the Soviets participated in the proposed invasion of Japan. It is hard to comprehend how such a poorly written book made it past any editorial staff."
4,reasons why we bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki,"Book details the reasons why the U.S.A. used the atomic bomb at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Generally the main reason given was that an American invasion of Japan would have cost half a million American casualties. The author also states several other reasons. Among them: the American belief in unconditional surrender, impressing the Soviets, and Truman's racism. There might be some truth in these areas, however the Japanese military would never have debated using a weapon like this. They waged total war, are we as Americans not supposed to wage total war when the other side is? Ron, if the bombs saved U.S. lives, I think it was worthwhile using these devices. Truman did the right thing."
1,"Not This Time, Ron","Dr. Takaki has earned a reputation as America's most prolific (and generally accurate) historian of Asian America over the past three decades. It saddens me, though, to see such an otherwise careful historian tarnish his reputation with a work whose accessibility will find it being read by secondary students who may not balance his account of the bombing with other viewpoints. I certainly hope the history teacher who reviewed and used this book demonstrated such objectivity in his lessons over this issue. I dread to think what will be thought of our involvement if students are left to Takaki's impressions. Aside from the historical inaccuracies in the book, I find it interesting that so little attention is given to the Japanese (military and civilian) culpability. Ron, you're usually on target, but not this time. If one wants a real read on this issue, I recommend ""Truman and the Hiroshima Cult."" Here's hoping you drop out of that cult, Ron!"
2,No need for A-bomb?,"This is a typical revisionist account attempting to prove that Dropping the A-bomb was not militarily necessary. I had to read this book for my WW2 class, with no counter-argument offered by my professor. This book will have you believe that US only dropped the A-bomb to stop the Russians from spreading to Asia, as indicative by Truman's hate of communism. The author gives a little bio of Truman to further his point. He asserts that the estimates of probable US dead in a mainland storming was execrated. This book is in essay form, putting out this type of argument. I think anyone who has any background in the Pacific campaign would not buy Takaki's argument. If one looks at the number of Japans dead at Okinawa and those dying in US fire bombings, the numbers killed by A-bombs don't seem as staggering."
2,On the Fence,"I wasn't very impressed by this book. The writing seemed very circular and plain ole boring. When reading it, I felt like all of what the author was telling me, I already knew. The information presented in this book could easily be found in Scott Cunningham's ""Solitary Wicca"". Is that bad? No. But if you're looking for something deeper and more spiritual, I don't believe you'll find it in this book.Sorry, folks :("
5,Another Fine Swing Session from the Verve Vaults,"Norman Granz (Verve founder and JATP Producer) must have been like a kid in a candy store in the 1950's when he was planning which all-stars to pair in various recordings and tours. His stable included a virtual who's who of big band legends and jazz up-and-comers and this session represents exactly that kind of pairing. You have Lionel Hampton on vibes, swing band icon who also became famous with the Benny Goodman small groups and Stan Getz on tenor who, at the time of this recording wasn't all that far removed from his seat in the famous ""Four Brothers"" sax section of Woody Herman. Backed by the quintessential west coast rhythm section of Levy, Vinnegar and Manne.....it swings!"
1,Does not run on xp,"My computer exceeds all system requirements, and this program will not run on windows XP, even when switched to win95 or win98 mode."
1,Bad purchase,"As per the item descriptions the idea is that I was buying the covers for the whole car. This is not true, it's only one row of seats and I figured it out after receiving the product. It's incredible that I was paying 200.00 for only one row."
3,Should Have Been Better,"As noted on the CD: ""Many of these recordings were transferred from disc sources. Surface noise is audible."" Yes it is, and it really detracts from the music. I can't believe they couldn't do a better job of cleaning up the sound.Based on the song selections, I had high hopes. Based on the sound quality, this CD was a disappointment."
3,Serious Background Noise,Great choice of compositions but serious background noise/hiss significantly detracts from the pleasure that this CD compilation could bring to the listener. I appreciate the use of original source materials for this Songbook but really wish they had spent some time cleaning up the background noise. What is particularly striking is when you hear a song that does not have the background hiss. It's at that point that you really get a sense of what could have been in this reissue of Peterson's Verve greats.Let's hope that in the recently issued 1 CD disc Oscar Peterson Standards that Verve has cleaned up the background hiss.
5,It makes finding angles a snap!,This tool makes finding the right angle to cut a snap! It cuts working time in half and reduces the mistakes I used to make in cutting angles.
2,Not as good as you think,"I may be the wrong person using this angle finder.Being a machinest all my life, I must deal with thousanths of an inch and seconds of a degree.So whe I took this out of the box and checked it with my master square,it was .6egrees off.When your cutting 22.5 degree angles,.6 of a degree makes a large mistake when yuo put your miters together.It was within the 1 degree +/-.One degree is a mile when you put your miters together."
5,Track List,1. 9:41 Nebuchadnezzar2. 5:57 Spiritual Awakening3. 5:41 The Governer4. 11:10 Deep In The Shed5. 5:43 Mysterious Interlude6. 4:09 E. Dankworth
1,Are you serious?,"I bought this game finding it in the store as the only DS game still in stock along with wiffle ball... after reviewing wiffle ball and seeing poor reviews I opted for FIFA 07... I am SO disappointed. Horrible game play, horrible touchy controls, need multiple cartridges to play anyone else, I guess maybe if you live, eat and breath soccer, you might KIND of like this game. Poor call EA SPORTS!"
4,Fun for all ages!,I got this game for my daughter for Christmas. She is a soccer player and I thought she would like it. She loved it and quickly found she had to fight her Dad for her DS because he loved the game also and kept taking it. Would recommend it for any age soccer/video game lover!
5,HAHAHA,The second season of Popular is amazing (cheesy) but in the most amazing of ways. I will never get over seeing Mary Cherry go in and out of her Barbara Streisand accent when she dyes her hair dark.
4,How Popular it is...even in the second season,"The first thing you will think after viewing the 2nd season of Popular, is WHY did it have to end? The humor is as silly, the writing is as sharp, and the acting is as good as the first season. What is better? The characters! You get to know more about Nicole's demons, laugh more at the great crazy Mary Cherry, and cry for sweet cute Harrison."
4,popular 2,It is a good insight into teenagers and all the problems they faced at high school. The writers have done this with some great humour and some serious topics to get their point across. The biggest regret about this series is that it didn`t continue for a third season.
5,Popular,"We had watched this series when it was on TV many years ago, and really enjoyed the refresher. Good fun, and very witty!"
5,Popular,"** ""Popular"" is one of those shows that was cancelled WAY before it should have been. It was so different, and so entertaining, that it is a shame it only lasted two seasons. It had two really great leads - Leslie Bibb and Carly Pope. It also had a wonderful supporting cast -- quirky and likeable, not-so-likeable, and interesting, but always fun. The episodes always had some serious event or other as the main story line, but there was always the humor that helped to amelorate the bottom line.** I didn't hesitate to buy the DVDs as soon as they were available. And even if you are not familiar with this series, I would still recommend them to anyone."
5,I wish i was popular.,"Popular - The Complete Second Season was one of the best shows on the WB (Felicity was #1 for me), Popular was created by the same dude that created Nip/Tuck. This show only lasted two little seasons, I was so upset when the network yanked the show off the air, what went wrong? This show was edgy, funny, and poigant all at once. Leslie Bibb was great as Brooke. Her character suffered setbacks during the second season, her past war with bulimia resurfaced, her archenemy became her step-sister and one of friends was diagnosed with leukemia. I miss this show so much, it makes me so mad when important shows get treated unfairly. Buy Season 1 as well, worth every penny."
3,1st Season Better than the 2nd,"I ordered both the 1st and the 2nd Season of ""Popular"" I really enjoyed the first season although towards the end of it, it started to get a little too out there. The 2nd season is really out there, entertaining, but it gets old fast."
5,I've never been happier with buying a product.,This product is one of the best ive ever bought. I Would recommend everyone to shop on amazon.
5,The Other American Roots Music Tradition of Talking About Things That Matter,"The music on this, the first CD I ever owned, is matched by the political/cultural awareness and sharp commentary.Although there is much here that shows Jayne Cortez is erudite, the simple, gut pleasure of the phrase ""Operation Desert Dumbness"" sticks with you."
4,Great drill - one flaw,"This driver drill is powerful, smooth and lightweight (3.8 lb). I can use the same battery charger as my other Milwaukee tools. The only flaw is that it is difficult to change the direction of the drill (forward/reverse) without using two hands. It can be done with one hand, but you have to shift your grip on the tool to do it."
4,Gorman DELIVERS the goods and then some...,"Ed Gorman has got to be one of the best thriller writers working in the genre today. Gorman's writing is sharp and easy to read, he doesn't over-write like so many others out there; his style is simple and straight-forward.Gorman keeps the story moving along, despite some slow spots, paces it well and keeps the premise pretty basic. The only pet peeve I have is the repetitive dialogue.""Really?""""Really.""That is what I mean. He does this several times during the novel and it gets a little annoying after doing it 4 or 5 times.However, the novel is excellent overall and Gorman is a master storyteller. This is a must-read for Gorman fans."
4,Pretty Good Read!,"I enjoyed reading this! It was definitely better than ""Hungry Eyes"" but not as good as ""Daughter of Darkness"". Keep up the good work!"
5,Avery glossy half-fold greeting card blanks,"This is an excellent product that is hard to find. The cards printed on them are ""store bought"" in appearance and much less expensive. I like this product very much."
3,15 Cards and Envelopes,I had heck time trying to find how many you get and if you get envelopes. Yes 15 cards and 15 envelopes in package. THe paper is like thin weight photo paper. So you can print photo on one side for sure. Not sure how ink will hold to the rest of card.
4,Making personal greeting cards,"I've been using this product to make my own greeting cards from my personal photos. People find it hard to believe I can produce such a professional card. The price is great, the product is great, and the delivery is quick. My only complaint is having the card stock and the envelopes in the same package. I'd love to have 100 packs of just the card stock. I can buy blank cards cheaper somewhere else."
4,Excellent,"Since Epson discontinued their greeting card paper, this is the best I have found for photo greeting cards where you want the quality of the photo to show."
5,Avery Ink Jet Glossy Cards,"These cards are the best I have ever used. The glossy finish gives a professional touch - even when using graphics other than actual photos such as clip art! Excellent, Excellent, Excellent. Definitely worth buying and keeping on hand."
5,Butter Toffee and Creme Cremesavers,I love this product and order it every few months. I'm always pleased with the speed of the delivery. It's difficult to find this product elsewhere.
4,Creme Savers HARD TO FIND flavor Butter Toffee and Creme,"I have been looking at stores all over my area and was unable to locate this flavor for my elderly mother. This is her favorite of all flavors. She was thrilled when I gave her a whole case for Mother's Day. Now she can share them with all of her friends (and ME, yummy!) Sure saves gas, time and money to order from Amazon.com"
5,Excellent Resource,"I highly recommend this reference to architects, builders and anyone planning to build north of the mason-dixon line."
3,Concise story of cell biology,"Another introductory book in the biology of the cell. I would say that the book is divided into mainly two sections, Cell structure and DANA, DANA replications etc. Second part takes almost two thirds of the book. I would prefer to read other Gene books when it comes to that point but for the cell structure, it is not bad. Some colored pictures, computer animations makes it easy to visualize things. Sections called ""experimental pathways"" scattered throughout the text takes you into current issues related to the subject. They are also quite sophisticated issues rather than practical problems. I think this book requires considerable guidance when read alone. I could not call this book as self sufficient or easy to read one compared to books by Alberts or Baltimore."
4,Great Book,The explainations and concepts are well written in this textbook and Gerald Karp is a great author.It can give you a lot of information about cell and molecular biology. A good book to keep if you are a bio major.
4,THIS BOOK IS GREAT BUT NEEDS SOME IMPROVEMENT,"I think that this book is simply great ,but it needs some improvement such as mentioning more about the diseases in the((HUMAN PERSPECTIVE))part.In addition,it should have more of the realastic figures about diseases.Basil Numan((MEDICINE STUDENT 1ST YEAR))."
4,Great job,The book was in great condition. Seller let me know that the book was in the mail which was nice.
5,price too high for spanish version.,I was noticing that the price in Spanish for Karp's cellular and molecular biology is way too high. I'd rather go for the english version...
1,don't get it,"if you want a mp3 player for a low price dont get this one get a nomad for about the same price but you get a fm tuner,voice recording and your also get more memory 64mb comparing to the 32mb that this one has, so dont get it."
5,Easy to use,For the price its sure worth it. It should maybe include more memory but u can buy that for a cheap price. It is easy to setup and worht it. I liked it.
3,Poor Expansion MMC Capability,"I recieved this MP3 player sometime ago as a suprise Christmas present. It is very adequate, however there are some problems with it. The number one problem is the serial connection to download songs onto it. Not only is it a hassle to have to unplug the printer everytime i want to put new songs on it, it is very slow compared to USB. The other problem comes with buying more memory for it. I purchased the 64Mb expansion card from Viking as an accessory from amazon.com and it didn't work. I was told by audiovox afterwards that nothing over 32 Mb will work in the expansion slot, and that not all brands of MMC work. So, buyer beware!"
1,IMPORTANT ONE MAJOR DRAWBACK!!,"If you plan on buying new computers in the future, do not buy this mp3 player. Although the player is good, you must use a 25pin parallel port to download from your pc. Audiovox tech support offers no alternative! I just bough a VAIO, and, like a mpdern computer company, SONY eschews old fashioned parallel ports for USB inputs. I suppose I could buy a $40 adapter to keep my unit from becoming obsolete. BUT WHY SHOULD I? Audiovox basically told me I was screwed on this one. Thanks for the support. F' em. I'm gonna hock my MP1000 and buy a decently designed MP3 player with current electronic technology."
4,Great Player!!!!!! For a good price,"The MpDj is an awesome player. The Screen is backlit and easy to read. The quality of the songs is awesome!!! The one problem is the space which can be solved by a memory card. Awesome! Go buy ""The Sicness"" by Disturbed. Its an awesome CD!!!"
1,"Will never, ever buy from Audiovox again","I liked the mp1000 until I upgraded to Windows XP, and was astonished to discover that the company will not support it. The device is now worth scrap metal. Customer Support responded with a form letter to the effect that they feel my pain, but drop dead anyway. Philip Christopher, the CEO, did not respond to my letter at all -- probably too busy making deals to bother with solidifying his customer base. Don't waste your hard-earned money on Audiovox products."
1,Agree with others- don't buy this!,"Unfortunately, I have to agree with the others- while this is a great MP3 player and it really served me well until I upgraded to Windows XP and found out the hard way that it was not compatible and there is no way around it!"
1,Audiovox MP-1000 Complete Junk,"I bought this MP3 players as a Christmas present for my wife. In the 6 months that she has had it, it has been back to Audiovox for repairs twice and now has stopped working again. It is out of warranty and definitely not worth the cost of an out-of warranty repair. I would discourage anyone from wasting money on this player."
3,What about WMA?,I like this player except for one big item. It will not play WMA. But if you look at the Audiovox website it promises the ability to play WMA by the end of 2000. Just take a look at the calendar now. I have emailed Audiovox with no response at all. I bought the MP-1000 thinking that it would not be long before I could listen to my streams I recorded using Voquette on the go and have only been let down.
3,Great condition Wrong Condition,Upon receiving the book it was nicely decorated with vintage stamps but uncovering the book revealed that it was a teachers edition that i didnt need so i went to the college bookstore and purchased a correct used edition for a jackson
5,The Springer is Choice to Buy,Yes it is more expensive than other dog bike attachment products but it's the only one that works properly and is enjoyable and safe to use. I have tried 2 others and the most important difference is that the others either didn't flex enough (tension was too tight and could not be practically asjusted) and/or posed a significant injury risk to my dog. Example the Springer won't impale your dog if you get in an accident or fall over - the Walkie-Dog though much cheaper is a straight solid metal bar that would land with my full weight directly into my dog if I fell over to his side. I'm not exaggerating - it is very dangerous so be aware. My dog loves going for his Springer run every day and because it flexes properly I barely feel him attached to the bike.
4,works fairly well,"I've used a springer for the last 6 years or so. Overall it works well, keeping the dog out of harm's way and giving you good control. The clamp construction is heavy stamped steel - once it is correctly mounted, you don't want to take it off and on regularly. I bought an extra seatpost and saddle for my bike just to keep the springer mounted on.You need to pay attention to you dog as it is easy to run them too hard - the only time we've crashed was when I over-exerted the dog and he took a hard turn away from me to go to a pond.Much much safer than messing around with a leash. Be aware of your dog and the environment and you'll be safe."
2,Not good for shorter people with small bike frames!,"The concept is good, and worked beautifully with my German Shepherd, but unfortunately being short (5') with a smaller bike frame, even with the clamp as high as it could go on the seat post, I kept clipping the back of my ankle on the curved part of the Springer--(which REALLY hurt!) It ended up being impossible to use, even with trying to keep my foot way forward on the pedal. Do not buy if you are short!!"
5,Really awesome,"I bought the shoes for my nephew, and it's really good. He would like them after I mail them out."
5,You Get What You Pay For!,"Wow! I love this hammer drill and sawzall combo set. The hammer drill is machined perfectly and the power that the drill delivers is just fantastic. I usually believe in buying all American made products, but I will gladly grant an exception. Milwaukee has taken the best of all worlds and put them together. The hammer drill is made in Germany, the batteries are made in Japan, and the sawzall in the US. Put these components together and you've created some of the best tools available. The only downside is that the sawzall drains the battery pack fairly quickly, but the battery does charge in about an hour. So, I think I'll get another battery. Quality, you do get what you pay for... Good job Milwaukee"
1,THIS IS NOT A LEGO PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am just going to say that it calls it a lego product, but it's wrong. It's not a Lego product!!!"
3,Not Lego but Canadian defunct C3 company (bought by Lego),"This is a so-so set. The Canadian company C3 was bought out by LEGO, but these sets were made by C3 and NOT LEGO. C3 is quite inferior to LEGO with several design and construction flaws, as noted by other reviewers herein. The correct product listing should NOT claim the product is LEGO, as it is very misleading."
4,Really fun to look at,"This little set, I would way, is very nicely designed. The two most iconic Batman characters in a setting that is fun to build, and they can actually be posed in many ways that will put a smile on your face throughout the day. Although I don't really ""play"" with toys anymore, I'm really happy with this bit of fanboy paraphernalia :D"
3,Lost in Art,"It's not just a song title, it's what was happening here. These guys who had so much promise and so much acheivement between them cut a bunch of crappy music that is short on ideas and high on pretensiousness. They had gotten tired of doing music that sounded like rock music, so they ended up making this strange attempt at anti-rock that is nearly impossible to enjoy.Of course, they didn't fall apart entirely at once. They cut a few tracks on here with some nice angular variants of rock rhythms that swing hard - ""Go"", ""Misery Goats"", ""Rounder"", ""Birdies"". ""Rhapsody in Pink"" worked out okay. But by the time you get to ""Arabia"", you're going to realize that this record is as a whole astonishingly bad considering what these guys were capable of."
1,unhappy in PA.,"Rachel and the Stranger (ITA) ( Rachel & the Stranger ) ( Vuelve a Amanecer ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - Italy]I haven't been able to view this because its in a non USA format and it cost to much to return , i don't think AMAZON should be allowing these things to be sold through them if its useless in this country, i'll read everything about it next time but not with Amazon.com"
4,Pioneer widower buys a bond-servant to mother his son.,"Surprisingly, Robert Mitchum can sing, and a fun little song he does with his friend's wife and son makes this movie worth watching.Back in the 1700's; poor people coming from Europe, to the U.S.; paid for their ticket on the ship by indenturing themselves as bond-servants for so many years; sometimes as long as 7-years. In this story a widowed man buys a female bond-servant to be a mother to his son; marries her, but treats her like a bond-servant with endless chores and coldness, rather than giving her her freedom, and treating her like a wife. A trapper, friend offers to buy the woman and set her free, and a jealous rivalry ensues.Filmed on location in a cabin in the woods alongside a river in hostile Indian country.A film about relationships; a little action; a relaxed pace, but enjoyable."
4,Must See for Loretta Young Fans,"this movie is a must see for all the Loretta Young, Bill Holden, & Bob Mitchum fans, it shows our country's early history with indentured servants, & our early settlers tenacity. This is a keeper"
5,Must see film!,"This is an excellent film and I very highly recommend it.""Rachel and the Stranger,"" hs a wonderful cast of the beautiful Loretta Young, also William Holden and Robert Mitchim. It's a very entetaining film, about a bond slave taken as a wife in the frontier days. It's vry good and an entertaining film. Loretta Young fans will especially like it."
5,Where has this gem been hiding?,I just watched this movie for the first time. The cast is incredible. Too bad it has not been released on DVD. I wouldlove to know more background about the film.
2,Horrible Sound,The music sound is very poor exept for the 3 videos included. I expected a better quality from el Torito.
2,Missing The Mark,"I know the others reviewers liked the book, but I did not. I am a BIG Fox fan and REALLY wanted to like this book. I enjoyed the pictures and some of the reflections from musicians and other friends. However, the book includes unfortunate gossip--statements made in private among friends that Virgil, and any other sane person, would not have expected to be written down for public consumption many years later. There are also some statements about Mr. Fox's private life that I didn't want nor care to know. The book even lapses into bad taste (chapter title using sexual reference, as one example). So much for my great hope that this book would be appropriate to give to young people in order to inspire them. I just do not feels this book honored the life of such a great artist. I truly hope someone out there will write a definitive biography that emphasiez his positive accomplishments!"
5,Fueled with all the dark energy and passion of the Doors and their music,"Val Kilmer is excellent in the role of Doors lead singer Jim Morrison. Fueled with all the dark energy and passion of the Doors and their music, this is one you won't want to miss."
5,INCREDIBLE MOVIE,Val Kilmer is at his best! I thought I was watching Jim Morrison. A must watch performance for anyone interested in The Doors!
4,Essential,"A friend recomended this book and now I see why. It is also referenced by Moreland, WL Craig, and Adams. If you need to educate yourself on Thoedicy then this is a good starting point. If you read from anyone else on this jubject you'll still have to have this book to see what they are referencing."
3,Confusing but Useful,"Although intended for the layman, Plantinga's writing style is dreadfully confusing. The common reader will have to read and re-read sections to understand the concepts posited. Mr. Plantina does, however, refute the atheist's claim that a holy God is incompatible with present evil. His arguments are consistent but he utilizes hypothetical worlds to substantiate his claims. Rather, he would have been more consistent and straightforward to simply assert the revealed truths of Scripture in the heritage of God's prophets and apostles. In any case, it is a valuable and interesting read, but only one familiar with linear logic should attempt to read it."
4,Stimulating read.,"""God, Freedom, and Evil"" was the first primary text by Plantinga that I have read, and it lived up to my expectations. I found the writing clear and rigorously logical, ambitious in scope yet succinct and not overly encumbered with technicalities. I was mildly disappointed with his approaches to natural evil and to Kant's critique of the Anselmian ontological argument. On the whole, though, this essay was impressive and certainly stimulating."
4,U2 go Fly,"Great vhs tape of Achtung Baby music. For me, that was their last great album. Too many versions of One, an overrated/overplayed single. Sorry Bono. But this tape shows how creative the band were and also how they have surrounded themselves with talented people. This should be on dvd.Fan of the band since Boy and have enjoyed watching them grow. Last two albums were ok (All that you and Atomic Bomb) but not inspiring. Let's hope next one is tho the single Get on your Boots is not working for me."
5,Stevie Ray Vaughan's best studio album,"Stevie Ray had temendous intensity in his early days with the main focus of his music on his guitar work. This album is a great second album after ""Texas Flood"" as Stevie kicks it up a notch. Scuttlebuttin' is a Stevie Ray signiture classic instumental as he rips it up on this one. ""Couldn't Stand the Weather"" (with input from his brother) has some of the best rhythm guitar written. ""Voodoo Chile"" is an excellent rendition of a Hendrix classic done very clean and intense. ""Cold Shot"" has the classic blues 'horse walk' beat with smooth lyrics.This album has Stevie Ray Vaughan at his peak. He added keyboards after this album for a new demension, and he had a more relaxed style after his reformation, but I feel he lost the laser sharp intensity that made him famous after this album."
4,SRV why did you leave us!,"As with most SRV albums, this is a mixture of fantastic and ordinary. Don't get me wrong, SRV was brilliant but none of his albums were brilliant all the way though. On this album, 'Tin Pan Alley', 'Cold Shot' and 'Voodoo Chile' in particular leave you wanting more. Most of the others do not measure up."
4,"Fanastic music, so so pressing","I am a huge SRV fan, and have recently gotten into vinyl and have been buying some of my favorite albums back on LP, so it was Stevie Rays turn. They throw this 180 gram stuff around a lot, but I would 10 to 1 rather have the regular Japanese or German pressing as the heavier, and reissues rarely are better than the originals, go figure. We live in the time of ""good enough"". CD's aren't better than vinyl, but they are good enough. Digital photography isn't better than film, but its good enough and convenient."
4,could've been better,"This is not even close to SRV's best studio work. The album feels rushed in production and SRV wasn't given enough time. However, this is still a very adequate follow-up to ""Texas Flood"". The title track is amazing. SRV's take on Hendrix's ""Voodoo Chile"" isn't much of a listen, SRV almost replicates it down to the tone. On the flip side, SRV's original compositions in the album aren't that great. Ok, so ""Scuttle Buttin'"" and the title track are amazing, but it dies off at the end with ""Honey Bee"" and ""Stang's Swang"". In my opinion, this album doesn't come close to touching ""Texas Flood"" or ""In Step""."
4,"SRV""s BEST ALBUM","His best studio effort to date, the title track is easily his best composition to date, a very funky version of Voodoo Chile, but unlike other reviewers, it is not better then Hendrix's version, SRV overall performance is excellent compared to his other albums. He sometimes lacks originality and comps other people's licks (Albert King and Hendrix)."
5,AWESOME ALBUM,"Unbelievable! By far the best blues album I've ever heard. His guitar playing gives goosebumps and the strings cry and scream. Strike me down, but I like SRV's version of Voodoo Child better than original Jimi. He is a true showman of Texas Blues. Blues fans will NOT be disappointed."
3,"Great Music, Bad CD Production","I have received 2 of these from Amazon and both have issues with the end of the first CD. I've tried on different players with the same problems with Stang's Swang and a few others. I think it's just a bad run of discs from the manufacturer. Too bad, this music is the best!"
3,Clock is very Loud ticking,"I just got this clock that I ordered...it is nice looking clock, however it IS REALLY LOUD ticking...after listening to it most of the Day, I have definitely decided this clock IS NOT for me....it drives me nuts....buyer beware....."
1,No Good,"While cheap, one out of five clocks I ordered is not keeping time. I emailed the company back with no response. DO NOT order this product. Fail."
3,The ticking is hard to get out of you head,"I purchased 2 of these clocks and I am going to start by saying that they keep great time and they look very good wherever you hang them,,,but the reason i gave them 3 stars is because they have such a loud ticking every second of the day that you cannot get it out of your head. Do not buy this clock if you are going to put it into a bedroom. You very well might not get any sleep. If you have a large enough room it might not be that bad, but that ticking is rought and it is hard to work around. Other than that they are a great clock for the price."
3,great clock for the price,We use these clocks to recreate custom clocks. They are a nice size and easy to manipulate for reassembly.Haven't had any problems and keep good time.
1,does not keep good time,does not keep time. disappointed with product. would not recommend. looks nice and the right size i was looking for but i need it to keep good time
3,Battery clock,"It is fine, for the price. It is a little loud, though? It is in our office, so not a big deal."
1,tick TOCK,Length:: 0:25 MinsRealy LOUD ticking for a quiet office. I've taken 30 secs of video and will try uploading it when I am near a cable.
2,Cheap but functional,"For $5.50, what can you expect? It works, but the LOUD tick...tick...tick makes it unbearable."
1,Wasted money,"I bought 3 of this back in November last year. I had them in their boxes never opened. I have them on my office now for 2 months. One died, I changed batteries but it doesnt tick anymore. Then i checked the other 2 and they are both 1 hours behind time. I used this to show local times from cities. So 1 is dead, and I will give away the other two because they both 1 hours behind. I will not fix the time every month so they are worthless. They are cheap yes, but unless your going to use them for a month or as shooting target dont buy them. Also, remeber this. The tick is so loud I can hear it 3 rooms away.This was a bad idea, I had not idea the tick was so loud, its annoying, you cannot even work with them."
2,makes noise,"I understand that this is an inexpensive clock and I should not expect much, but it is noisy. I bought it because a previous reviewer write that it did not make any noise. It is loud!"
1,second hand got stuck after 1 month,"loved the clock at first. great price, looks nice, etc. etc.but after 1 month, the second hand got stuck (it gets stuck on the 8, but is fine if the clock is put flat on a table, which of course makes it useless).so, caveat emptor..."
3,Noisy clock...,"If you will use only as a bathroom clock, you can buy this. But if you will use in inside your room well dont buy. This clock is very noisy one, second hand keeps ticking like a time bomb. Very annoying."
2,Small Clock and Cheap Plastic,This turned out to be smaller than i expected and was made of cheap plastic.Remind me to spend some more money on wall clock.
2,Need Fixing on Arival,"Clock did arrive two days earlier then the estimated arrival date, which is nice; HOWEVER, the clock's battery casing is damaged but operable. Also, the minute hand was bent in such a way that it prevented the second hand from making a full pass through the clock. I had to take off the faceplate and re-bend the minute hand so that the second hand could pass through unimpeded. My suggestion: DO NOT BUY!"
3,3 out of 4 work perfectly,"For a cheap clock it's works just fine, but it's a little on the loud side. The only problem is I have 4 of them and while 3 are perfect the 4th is 5 minutes behind and even when I reset it it goes back to 5 minutes behind within a week. Never goes farther behind which is weird, but it's annoying."
4,It works,"We've had this clock for almost two years now. The clock still works; it's easy to read, great in the office. Obviously this isn't a family heirloom or meant to be displayed in pride in the formal dining room, but as an affordable, working object for the gym, office, garage, or casual setting, it's great."
2,These peel off!,"If these didn't peel off regularly, this would be a fantastic product. However, about half of these peel off after a few weeks of being on tabbed files."
4,Inspirational,"This is not a technical manual, but a motovational speech put to paper. I found it inspirational and motivating. It is a very quick read. I found that it is best read one or two topics at a time."
4,Judo Heart and Soul,"In reviewing the book, Judo Heart and Soul, I found the layout of photo's and text both relevent to the subject of Judo on both the experiences and the follow up pictures very relevant and informative for both the novice as well as the more experienced Judoka. not only at the club level, but also at all levels of competition, be it regional,inter state, national & international. The dedication and hard training necessary can be realized by the descriptions throughout the book. excellent work and material for an aspiring Judoka. Ken Whitney"
5,Love It,Great actors and great story. It is amazing how relationships are different in many ways. The preview gave me the encouragement to purchase the DVD
5,Think like a man,Well this one I have not see ether so it be something to look forward to see this also. I hope it turns out funny also.
1,Don 't buy it,"If you have a RIZR Z3, do not get this product. It does not fit, does not charge the phone and is not approved by motorola."
5,Love this product!,We had a same sort of item when I was younger for camping....so I looked online and found the same type of thing for my own trip. Thank you!
2,An Unnecessary Purchase,"I traveled for months out of a 37L backpack and so I had to do my own laundry a lot. I didn't use this thing once nor can I see myself in a situation where I would be able to hang it up, but not hang up the clothes I wanted to dry. You just don't need it."
5,Made one-bag travel possible!,"I decided on this clothesline after reading about it on the One-Bag Traveller site. It made a week-long international vacation possible -- with only a few changes of clothing! I used it every night, and was able to rig it up in each of the B&Bs we stayed at, no problem. The loops even fit around some large, round doorknobs! Good stretch, sturdy loops, and great gripping ability. Definitely a must-have for any extended trip! :)"
4,Great travel option,"Very sturdy construction, but compact and flexible. Not quite long enough, in my opinion, but perfect for smaller spaces. Invaluable!"
4,An Essential clothesline,"A highly recommended travel clothesline. It is the prefect complement for any traveler trying to pack lightly and does not mind washing their clothes during the trip. The cord is light weight, strong and versatile. The braided cord works as described as I have trapped underwear, socks, and shirts. For heavier clothing like pants and sweaters, if you braid multiple points on the clothing, the line should be able to maintain the weight by the friction and force. Otherwise you can drape your clothing over the line to dry as well.One other recommendation is to carry two clips or carabiners so that you can easily clip the line to itself or to other stationary objects. This will be saying in my travel bag from now on."
4,"Very helpful, but needs carabiners","I just took this clothesline on a week long ski trip to Breckenridge, CO. I was able to launder my Patagonia base layers on a daily basis and dry them overnight with this clothesline. It seems well made and gripped clothing well, but the end loops didn't allow for set up as easily as I would have liked. I have subsequently added some small (not for climbing use) carabiners and the set up is now exceptionally easy. I was able to take an eight day ski vacation with only 1 carry one bag thanks to this clothesline.Highly recommended once you add some carabiners."
4,"great, absolutely great.","Bought this for a vacation, I was out for 5 weeks.Does a great job, simply. You fasten the ends, and slide your wet clothes into the weave.My only gripe regards the loops at the ends. I found that often there wasn't much to fasten a loop onto. Instead, I found that it was more convenient to have hooks, or better yet, both!At a local market I asked a man for the metal hooks he used to display his items with, he gave me two. I fastened them around the loops of the Flexoline, and voila! The best of both worlds.If you'll be traveling, absolutely consider doing this before you venture out, as I found I wasn't able to use my line often because of it."
5,Good Quality,"This clothesline will last for a long long time. I use it weekly to hang up a variety of small items. It holds everything in place. Actually, when everything is finished drying, I just grab each end and walk the entire line to my bedroom to put each item away. Nothing falls off, it keeps everything secured. I wish it was longer, but for the size it will fit the average bath tub/shower area with no problem. I purchased the ""Sea to Summit"" clothesline too, so I can have an extra long one, and it works for larger items really well. But, for socks/undies etc this clothesline can't be beat. This is a small clothesline, and works best for traveling."
5,A BRIEF INSIGHT INTO HISTORY ON THE HIGH SEAS,"(...)From a sociological standpoint, many parents with little means to support their families allowed their young children to leave their homes and seek out the life that may or may not have have been meant for them, many at a very young age. As a result, their sexual and socioligical attitudes were lacking.Another issue about Van Buskirk's diary is not what he wrote in his diary but what he failed to include in it. (...)What were the backgrounds of the other young sailors he shared his life with? He gave almost no insights into the other sailors' backgrounds and previous pasts. Was he so intent on his glorious crusade to stop them from their ""evil"" ways that he had no time to find out something about their ""checkered"" pasts? Of course, we will never know the answers to these and many other questions.All in all, this diary captures a rare view of one man's life as a sailor as well as his self sacrificing, moral crusade for those around him."
3,Good Album,"Personally I feel that 'I scare myself' is a little over rated. The violin solo did not rock my world. Today this kind of music would probably be considered by many as quirky. That may be case, but there are some good tracks here. 'Moody Richard' is a great song, really very interesting. Getting this record is worth it just for the pleasure of listening to the back up vocals and Hick's guitar work."
4,"Fun music, with lyrics that creep into your memory.","I first heard this music on Johnny Carson years ago and I loved it. I had the record, and wore it out, so now I am getting the CD. The songs are fun to sing-a-long with."
5,Fun desserts,What a way to create a different type of dessert for the family. They loved them. Can't wait for Xmas to try different treats for everyone. Easier to do than I thought
4,They are cute,"I like it. Its simple, and it does what it say's. The sanwhiches are sooooo cute. Wish it had better cookie reciepes from scratch in the little booklet though."
3,Fun for kids!,"I do love these molds! I use them to mold hard boiled eggs for school lunches. They are fun and the kids enjoy eating something that is good for them.They are a little on the pricey side for something that has only three pieces to it. However, it is something I will use often. I also used them to make ice cream sandwiches for the kid and those were also a big hit. I used root beer float ice cream and vanilla wafer cookies crunched up. Ummmm. Again a little work for only three sandwiches so you might want more than one set, but for an occasional treat, they are great. The designs show up better on the eggs then on the ice cream sandwiches but no one complained about that."
5,excellent kitchen fun for kids,"My 8 and 10 year old children had a blast making these--they are easy to use and made a sandwich that is smaller than a store bought, which I prefer. This product comes with cookie making recipes but we used the Nestle Tollhouse recipe using gluten free ingredients and Earth Balance instead of butter. The gluten-free version worked just fine. The molds get clumps of cookie on them that you have to wipe off as you go on making more, but that's the nature of what you are working with, not a product defect. One set worked well enough and we assembly lined it. I noticed the little imprints you see in the picture of the dots, star, and ""xo"" did not show up in our dough recipe. (BTW, there are no gluten and dairy free ice cream sandwiches on the market that I have ever found so now my kids can enjoy this treat with others)."
1,Macrock X,"Boston, MA -awesome Boston, MA metal band that was by far my favorite of the conference, I actually bought their CD""Asylum of the Human Predator"". I belive the title track of the CD ""Asylum Of The Human Predator "" has become my new anthem; with lyrics like ""Save me one time, won't you, take this blackend heart and make it whole... ). Every player in this band is at the top of his game and this is the kind of metal that deserves to be called METAL! Killer album with crushing drums, driving bass, amazing twin guitar attack and dynamic in your face vocals. Keep up the good work guys!"
4,Keeping Ma on the map for metalcore,"As the Ma area has quickly become the birth site for much of the metalcore movement over the past couple of years with bands like SHADOWS FALL and ALL THAT REMAINS, HELL WITHIN are continuing to carry the torch with their ""Asylum of the Human Predator"" album. As with the previously mentioned bands, HELL WITHIN have taken a thrash base and added multiple flavors to create something that is purely their own. Some of the essences found in this release are sketches of hardcore muscle flexing and Swedish death metal that carry all the blazing guitar hooks and quick-time double base clobberings. Fortifying this intelligently balanced mixture is periodic melody stimulated singing and whining guitar solos. What they accomplished in this album is probably one of the hardest things to-blending the relentlessly brutal with jagged preciseness that will surely dispose of those who are in their path."
2,Less than a good fit.,This case appears to be genaric. There is no place for the plug in power supply for my portable sound dock. I must be careful when using the small pockets on the end (used for the IPOD and remote control) because they could easily be crushed. On the other hand the price was right.
5,Case,"I do carpentry work, so I like taking my i-pod music to some of my work projects. This case is a great way to protect my soundock while carying it with my tools."
1,Not the right case for the PORTABLE sound dock,"The case was advertised as going with the PORTABLE Bose sounddock I purchased when, in fact, it is only for the Bose sounddock. Consequently, it didn't fit and had to be returned. The advertising is wrong on it so look for the PORTABLE Sounddock case if that's the sounddock you buy."
4,well made,This is well made but could have been designed better by having a top opening instead of the side opening.
4,Ideal item,Well designed and fits like a glove. Couldn't be happier and feel safe about traveling with my Bose soundDock station now.
5,Great bag,This was a great Christmas gift. My husband got a bose system for his birthday and this was a great fit at a great price. Just make sure you have the right bag for the right system.
1,No good for English speakers learning Swedish,"Swedish words are preceded by either ""en"" or ""ett"". There is no rule for this so when you are learning a word you need to learn whether it's an ""en"" word or an ""ett"" word. This dictionary doesn't include this information so it's almost useless. I have to buy another dictionary now instead. Nor does it include the plural form of words which is another desirable function of an English Swedish dictionary. I don't understand why this book is so expensive. Be warned!!! Don't waste you money!"
4,A tip-top top-notch compilation!,"This double CD summarises beautifully the last year or so of action in the radio airplay stakes. If for some reason you're unlucky enough not to be familiar with the British pop scene, then listen especially to Death In Vegas, Moby, James and don't miss Noel Gallagher's terrific acoustic reading of ""Half The World Away."" His finest moment. But seriously, you will be listening to this excellent compilation for months and months when others are still languishing in the bargain bin."
1,There are freaks,And then there are freaks who struggle to get a book published. I like weird or off the wall books but quality writing must prevail.
3,A fine coredless saw with limitations,"It works, it cuts well, but it runs the batery down FAST and it is best limtied to 1/2 inch ply or less. It is slow because it can not hit the RPM of a plug in saw. But for working far from the outlets it will do the trick"
3,Not the Saw for Me,"I purchased this saw for ripping through plywood and cutting 2x4's when at a distance from electrical outlets. I had to push it through 2x4's because of the saws resistance. It's not as smooth as I expected. The battery life is very good and the saw build qaulity is excellent. The exterior casing is extremely tough, but if the saw will not get light jobs done correctly, whats the use of owning one. I'm going with the Blue brand. Smooth, powerful,precise, and durable, although the handle doesn't seem as tought as the Milwaukee."
3,Has some problems,"The milwaukee is built very well, but has some problems which can affect the qaulity of cut on your work. First of all, the blade is not sqaure to the shoe. The rear of the shoe is about 1/16 of an inch wider than the front of the shoe. When accuracy counts, this will affect the work piece. The bevel guage is about 2 degess off when squared at 90 degress. Although it is built well, these problems should be addressed by Milwaukee. If only the shoe were cut sqaure and the bevel guage were re-engineered, I would give this saw a 5."
5,"All the tricks in the book, are shown in this book.",This book correctly shows exactly how the US government has continuously tried to disrupt democracy in Venezuela for its own gains. A very interesting case study for anyone wishing to understand how the US conducts its foreign policy.The methods shown in this book have been replicated all over Latin America notably in Nicaragua and Chile but also recently in Peru and Mexico.If you have ever thought that your loony leftwing friends were paranoid ... read this.
2,Didn't stand up to my son,"My son loved the silly seat, but it didn't stand up to extended play. After standard two-year-old play (dragging it around, flipping it upside down, sitting on it constantly), it developed leaks in two of the air chambers. We couldn't find the leaks to fix them, so we got rid of the toy, three months after we got it. I also thought the batteries were extremely difficult to replace. The whole thing was extremely frustrating and disappointing."
2,Defected,"I bought my 1 and 4 year olds both a chair, and they loved them. The fact that they loved the chairs made it even harder when they both started to deflate within 3 days. The concept of the chairs are cute and would make a great seat and toy if they were better made. The material is very durable looking, but I guess the seams aren't together well enough. The chair will not stay inflated, and the more you try to put air in it once it starts to deflate the worse it gets. After this happened I got on and looked at other peoples reviews, and most of the reviews said that there chairs deflated also. Don't waist your money."
4,Great chair!!,My son loves his chair. He sits infront of the tv and watches TV and of course Blue's Clue. He keeps his notebook handy as well. It is the perfect size for him and he can move it around the room too to sit where he wants.
1,Adorable but doesn't last!,"My son totally loved having his very own ""Blue Clue Chair"" but after a week, it literally fell apart at the seams! Now I have to blow it up every morning and within an hour or two, it is deflated again. I tried repairing the tear in the seam but nothing will hold. If your child is rough or big for his age, this is NOT the toy for you."
1,Not Happy,"My one year old son received this chair as a gift from his aunt. We blew it up as soon as we opened it. Unfortunately the next day it deflated. I tried applying a patch to it, but since the hole is in the seam, the patch won't hold. An obvious manufacturer's defect. But being the crazy parent that I am, I blow that darn chair up a couple times a day b/c my son does love it. He carries it around from room to room and likes to push the paw button."
1,not the best for the money dosent last long,I bought this chair for both my 4 year old son and 2 year old daughter they both lasted a day before they riped at the seam and deflated I think its a factory defect because both chairs got holes in the same place anyway my kids loved them but they were very upset when they popped if you dont want to listen to your child crying for a week dont get this I ended up spending more money on those soft fold out sofas which we bought shortley after christmas and so far they have lasted much longer my kids are rough on toys things just need to hold up to every day abuse these chairs just didnt pass the kid test. I think this item should be discontinued or at least made of more durable material I have purchased other inflatebale toys and they have held up nicely.
1,a disapointment,I bought 2 Talking Silly Seat for my 3 and 5 year old We blew it up and by the next morning it was deflated
3,It's cute but that's it,I purchased this for my nephew when he was 3. He's a pretty big boy and all boy. Within the first couple of days there was a problem with the talking device and it wounded up in the garbage soon after.
2,Does not last long,I bought this for my son when he was 2. It lasted about a week. He wasn't rough with it and only sat in it to watch his fave show Blues Clues. It started to deflate and he was very upset. I thought maybe our cat got ahold of it so I bought him another one. Only for that one to last 2 weeks. With that one I made sure the cat never sat on it and put it up when he was not playing with it. He loved the chair and we went through a week of crying for it. Not worth the price or seeing my child so upset after it deflated. The material just wasn't sturdy enough.
5,"im not a kid, im 16 i just dident know my moms password","all the other SRV fans have already told u how great this album is im just here to talk about the bonus track ""life without you"" (live). the studio version is good but this version is so much better, words cannot describe how i feel about it. its expanded by about 10 minutes and includes one of stevies free form raps. But what makes me love it so much is the expression and raw emotion stevie puts into every note. i close my eyes when i listen to it and i get this indescribable feeling and enter this state of mind were nothing else matters or even exists. it sounds corny i know, but that is the power that this song has. anyways i think i will wrap up my seemingly crazy description of the song and my feelings for it. i love the rest of the album to but this is my favorite track. please, dont hesitate in buying it."
4,VERY GOOD TEXAS BLUES-ROCK,"Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble created several very good albums, and this one is probably the best of the bunch. I can understand why SVR is considered a guitar great. And the other members of the band are also excellent musicians. Each person has a particular taste in music, but no matter your preference, any person who appreciates good music will recognize the quality of this man, band, and album."
5,FAVORITE AND VERY BEST STEVIE RAY VAUGHAN CD,"In Step is by far my favorite Stevie Ray Vaughan cd! From the first note of The House is Rockin', we hear Stevie Ray blasting off with what is the best rock blues guitar playing that you will ever hear. Nine hard-driven songs later, Stevie Ray Vaughan plays the beautiful and sublime Riviera Paradise. Next is a short informative speech by Stevie Ray and then come four live tracks, which are my favorites. On In Step Stevie Ray does a very cool job of singing. His strong voice is the perfect compliment to his strong music. Double Trouble provides excellent musical support. In Step was recorded shorthly after Stevie Ray kicked drugs. Maybe it is his new found sobriety that makes In Step sound so fantastic. Whatever the reason(s)for its brilliance, In Step is a masterpiece of rock blues! In Step has my highest positive recommendation.John"
4,Love Riviera Paradise,"I bought this cd for the Riviera Paradise track, which is amazing, but the cd as a whole is great listening."
5,This man changed my life,"I am a gutair player myself. But this man change my whole musical career. He change the way I thought blues should be played. I never get tired of listening, talking, or whatching Stevie on video. This album is I think his best ever. I still get choked up when I think about how he died and the great music that was sure to come if lived. I love your music Stevie rest in peace. Tell Jimi hi"
5,probably his best album,"A very listenable-to blues album indeed... a bouncy opening track (House is Rockin') followed by several prime cuts of blues - Tightrope, Crossfire, Leave my girl alone, and Wall of denial are my favourites, great guitar, flowing rhythm, and some exuberant flourishes."
2,"Interesting, but not sure how scientifically supported","Bought this after reading an article by Mark Bittman on this guy (his doctor). It seems interesting for those who suffer from digestive problems, but not sure how legitimate all the science in this book might be. Good read if you want to vary your diet in an effort to find what works for your system."
2,Great Kitchen item,This is the perfect size and weight. It works great in the kitchen so it is used all the time.
5,VERY good,"this movie really scared me! buy it if u wanna be scared.(:its actually not that much about the paranormal stuff, but it was still very good anyway (:"
4,Always ahead of the curve,"One of the most adventurous, creative groups of all time unleashes this classic Sparks tune, complete with great feline frolics video. One of my favorite recent Sparks songs, plus an interview!"
5,deeply moving,"I had the immense pleasure of seeing Nina Simone live in concert in Oslo, Norway in 1990. That concert is forever with me, and this glorious live recording is the closest I will ever come to that experience. Simone never ever turned out a bad record, but live she is probably more deeply moving than any other performer. There is hardly anything that can match being two, three meters away from this stunning artist at a successful concert. This record can take you there...almost."
4,"I usually don't like live CDs, but...","...this is a good live CD and a great example of Nina Simone's work. She has a haunting, emotive, unusual voice that really grows on you. I actually like this CD better than some studio work she has done due to the arrangements that really highlight her vocal talent."
1,"Nina at her worst, definitely....","Nina Simone has never sounded worse on this live Vine Street recording. The vocal talent that she was so well known for in the late 1950's through the 60's is definitely lacking here on this release. Often flat, singing without any feeling whatsoever, Nina Simone is a complete disapppointment. Don't waste your money on this release! For better Nina listening, try Collectable Record's Nina Simone At Town Hall/The Amazing Nina Simone, Nina At Carnegie Hall/Nina With Strings, or Nina Simone Forbidden Fruit/Sings Duke Ellington....or any of the Phillips or RCA releases...at this stage in her career, Nina Simone proves in this pathetic recording that she has lost the ability to sing...her honey & vinegar sound that we all know and love is missing; what was so well loved in her recordings during the Colpix/Phillips/RCA years doesn't manifest itself...no studio machinery could mask the fact that Nina Simone should now stick to playing the piano or retire..."
5,A wonderful text.,"Concise and wonderfully coherent, this book isn't filled with ""fluff"" such as dumb examples and spoonfed advice. Clearly targeted for a mathematically inclined class of undergraduate modern algebra students, you will find the immense amount of knowledge and the price of this book to be absolutely pleasing."
4,Good look into a legend,"This was a good look into the life of a climbing legend, especially how he got interested in climbing and what he has been up to more recently."
2,Just a short interview,"I should've listened to the reviewer who said this DVD is short and really just an interview... or series of interviews. I wanted to like this but didn't. If you're looking for something about mountains, look elsewhere. Like the other reviewer said, this would be a good DVD to add to your collection if you can find it used for $5, but no more than that."
2,poor quality toy,"I bought this set for my four year old's fifth birthday since he loves Superman and Lego style building blocks.Unfortunately, this toy is so poorly made that the throne room was difficult to put together and keep together. It won't stay together when assembled if it's touched.Likewise, Superman's hair/ears and legs keep falling off.This set might be fine for a collector who is going to assemble it (with glue?) and leave it on a shelf.It's poorly constructed for play.Why did DC choose such a poor company to manufacture their sets?This set is several steps below Legos and a couple of steps below Megablocks in quality."
1,myopic perspective,"Cover to cover, this book has flaws. A personal take on the area of scientific arguments, I feel that many of the statements are speculative or misjudged. This book pales in comparison to a revered work on the topic such as The Structure of Scientific Revolutions by Thomas Kuhn. A far better recommendation for its historical content and expertise. Science In Action could be dismissed as unnecessary aside from a few valid points and revelations. The content and diagrams offer little useful information to the reader. Better a qualified point of view for an objective examination of Science."
1,Trivial where not incorrect,"Latour again demonstrates trivial insights and egregious errors. He simply does not know his subject (allegedly science) well enough - he makes conceptual and factual blunders. I am glad this book is still in print because it is a useful aid in teaching humanity students about science - but not in the way Latour had envisioned! By understanding his misinterpretations, we can learn how laypeople get confused."
3,Published in 1969,"Perfectly fine book overall, but I didn't notice the publication date of 1969. The diagrams are ancient, and not in a good way. Historians or expert diagram creators might dig it, but not me."
5,Goodman's Energy Flows Again,"The release provides an excellent example of Steve Goodman's energy and enjoyment in making and interpreting music. He conveys a joy in performing that comes out of this recording. The song selection, such as ""Lincoln Park Pirates"" and ""Three-Legged Man"" bring a smile to one's face. He has an interesting reflection on today's debate evolution vs. creation in ""The Family Tree"". Another interesting social commentary is found in his ""Men Who Love Women Who Love Men"". This release includes ""Old Smoothies"", which is a sentimental look at attending the Ice Capades with his grandparents in the 1950's. Something I could relate to having grown up on the Chicago area and seeing the ""Smoothies"" actually perform - ""when the Blackhawks were on the road""."
4,Good stuff,"THis is really a fun disk. Songs you dont' normally hear plus a live version of ""City of New Orleans"". The best of Chicago and Steve Goodman."
4,Gemmell's Always Great,"Yet another great story from Gemmell, my favorite author of all time. The Rigante stories are always intriguing, and while not the best in the series this is another solid performance."
2,One of the worst,"After the huge disappointment of Ravenheart, I expected Gemmell to do what he did in The Hawk Eternal - create a sequel that would make the first book something great and more importantly, tie up all its loose ends.Stormrider (and Ravenheart) had many great ideas and concepts, it laid similar foundations to Sword in the Storm and Midnight Falcon, and had the seeds of greatness within it.Whilst the book was heroic, it went from nowhere, to someplace worse and became lost in the void. I am one of the biggest fans of David Gemmell, and it disappoints me to state that this book is by far, the worst David Gemmell book, I have ever read.It is almost as if he ran out of ideas and gave up half way and tried to end the book as quickly as possible.Avoid this book, don't even borrow it from the library.However, I gave it 2 stars as I cannot bear the thought of david gemmell receiving the lowest rating available."
3,Not the best of Gemmells work,As a matter of fact the worst of it. Compared to Ravenheart the book is an utter disapoinment. It is the book Gemmell had to write because Ravenheart was just so damned good. The whole thing drags on through. I had a hard time getting attached to any of the characters with the exception of the Moidart. That's right the unspeakable villian from Ravenheart is the most likeable character in this book believe it or not. He was the only character that I found myself chuckling at whenever his point of view would come up. The end is OK at best. All in all you can't stop yourself from reading it just because Ravenheart was so good but be prepared to just sit down and get through it. Besides bringing closure to the series it won't do much else for you.
2,"I'm sorry, but it is actually a boring book.","This is the 4th book I've read by Gemmel and the first three were amongst the most rip-roaring heoric fantasy I've ever read.This one was too slow, too convoluted and had too many different story threads with wildly unrelated characters to easily keep track of what was going on. Based on my past experiences with Gemmel, I expected something much crisper. The writing and characterisation are still great, but the plot and size and pace are deader than a really dead thing that's been killed, twice."
4,Great Addition!,"Stormrider is a great addition to the series. Having read the previous reviews, I was not expecting much and was pleasantly surprised."
3,This book truly an American Grotesque,"This book should be considered a novel of fiction rather than non-fiction. It is a very interesting book if one has never done a full study of the Garrison investigation. Much of the information contained in this book is inaccurate, and when reading at the very beginning, he tells which side he is on, and rather than bring about the truth, he only brings forth evidence in which will side with the defense, leaving out very pertinent information. This book is in the category of ""plot or Politics"" By Rosemary James, and ""False Witness"" By Patricia Lambert, whom all attack Jim Garrison. One must look at the sources in which they use, and when you look, you see that the sources in which they use is reworded to fit their account of the investigation. Don't take this book seriously if you are seeking the truth!"
2,Gospel Bluegrass is better,"I was just trying to see if simple bluegrass basics would appeal to me. Im trying to sway away from mainstream POP and noise with some more meaningful music. Bluegrass has been it ever since I saw O'Brother Where Art Thou? But Gospel Bluegrass is more to my taste, as this CD was not close to the songs of that movie."
3,Good bluegrass,"This CD is good---but not great. There is better bluegrass music to be had, but as a historical record of little known bluegrass bands, this is not bad.The song selection could have been better in my opinion."
1,Not for most of us,"If you use the Macintrash and has tons of money for high-end software, this may be for you. For 99% of the world, this book doesn't give you anything you can put to use. Avoid."
4,The only game I ever finished,"I loved this game. I must admit, I couldn't finish it without help from the website, but it's the only one that I really wanted to play whenever I had the time. I've tried Myst (took too long) and other games (Lost in Time, etc). And I also played Carmen Sandiego when it first came out, but The Neverhood had sly humour, problems easy enough to solve but not too easy, and funky music. I'm 55 by the way, so I think it's a game anyone can enjoy."
5,NOT FOR SERIOUSLY FAST PACED GAMERS OR CAFFEINE LOADED A.D.D.-ERS,"This game is long and slow and incredibly frustrating, and worth every minute! We got a second hand copy without any directions or anything with it. Fortunately there are hints online, but there is nothing quite like the thrill of figuring out the puzzles all on your own. We also looked forward to the new discoveries in each part of the world and checking out all the surrounding stuff to see what we might discover... And it's just as fun to play again even after you have reached the end! I also highly recommend the soundtrack featuring all of the ingenius tunes from Neverhood and Skullmonkeys: [...]"
3,Not To Be Sold to Minors,"Just your basic info on this DVD: It's another of Tai Seng's soft-core profiles of a Japanese nude model - in this case the lissome Haruki Mizuno. The production values are splendid, the model is stunning, the settings and set-ups are designed to show off the model's substantial physical beauty. More esthetic than erotic. But it is not 'PG' material, unless Jack Valenti at the MPAA has had some Scrooge-like change of heart and is opening the flood gates (as if ratings had any appreciable effect on social values)."
1,Sucky sucky sucky.,"I bought this at Staples, and came here to see if anyone else had the problems I've had with it.I can tighten all the screws except for the one that keeps the camera upright. What good is a tripod when I'll have to hold the arm to keep it upright at all times?I wish I still had the packaging it came in, I'd return it toute suite. Don't even bother with it. Defective defective defective."
4,OK PRODUCT FOR THE MONEY,"NOT A BAD TRIPOD FOR THE MONEY BUT,LEGS FULLY EXTENDED ARE KIND OF FLIMSY AND NO LEVELING BUBBLE."
5,Grand-daddy of them all!,"This is the book that started it all. It is, on the one hand, an account of the sailing craft still surviving in the early '70's in the Lesser Antilles, complete with lines drawings and many B&W photos, and on the other hand, a story of the search up and down the island chain for these craft and the cultural influences they showed, as well as the building of one of them, in which the author took part, on the tiny Grenadine island of Bequia. The writing is excellent, the story is well worth reading."
3,"Campy, funny, skilled musicians akin to B52's only diff.","I saw them at a festival in Portland, Oregon and my friend and I agreed that they were the best of all of the entertainment that evening. Fun music presented with campy humor! We can't wait to see them again."
3,Fine,I used this text as a follow up reference text. It was not the first book I would go to for reference material.
2,Considered a classic?,Just because this commentary is considered a classic doesn't mean that it is particularly insightful. Matthew Henry lacks knowledge of biblical culture and often resorts to simplistic reiteration of scripture. In my years of ministry I have found Matthew Henry to be one of the least used commentaries.
4,Good literary mystery,"A must-read for Loretta Lawson fans and lovers of literary thrillers. True, it helps to have read her previous novels in the series. While ""Full Stop"" is not the strongest entry (its USA location isn't that enthralling) Joan Smith is an interesting writer, and the series is well worth reading, especially if you are involved in any way with academia and literary criticism."
1,Unappealing protagonist and disconnected plot twists,"While the premise of this book is interesting, I found the protagonist, Loretta Lawson, unappealing and character-less, and was confused by the anti-American sentiment and blatant stereotyping displayed throughout the book. The various plots within the book seem disconnected, as though one has had to read previous Loretta Lawson mysteries to know what is going on. An odd tie-in at the end to a previous love affair left me confused. Intellectual snobbism seems to run through the book. References to obscure authors and their work have little to do with the plot, and come across as an excuse to self-aggrandize, rather than adding to the reader's interest. I was very disappointed with this book, as the plot description seemed intriguing, but the characterizations bordered on actively unpleasant."
4,Interesting read,"I loved the heroine of the book, and I loved the references to art and culture. I found the ending to be a bit sketchy and unrelated to the beginning of the book. I will be reading her again, however. She created a smart character and detective."
1,"y como es el, los exitos","Once again, i was very annoy buying this produc couse linea naranja got only 6 songs and price and delivery make this product expensive because it is not full cd.."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"This book was not worthy of Sandra Brown. It was very unbelievable & not suspensful at all, as the jacket leads you to believe. Also, the language and violence was senseless. Instead of it helping us to understand the character, it was offensive and tedious. Sandra Brown, can do so much better than this. If you're a big fan skip this one, you'll be dissappointed."
3,Unspeakable was a little disappointing.,"I've read all of Sandra Brown's books and Unspeakable is not one of her best. I found that the relationship between Anna and Jack lacked the powerful sexual tension that is the trademark of Ms. Brown's other books, such as French Silk, Silken Web and Best Kept Secrets. Though the story was very interesting, I found much of the violence depicted in the book to be excessive and unnecessary. Unspeakable was a nice diversion, but unlike Ms. Brown's other books, I will read this one only once."
3,A great book for when you don't want to think too hard,"I admit it. Sometimes I just like to pick up a book and read without really thinking. I spent one rainy Saturday on the couch reading Unspeakable. It was a real page turner, but more for simple language than compelling plot. It was pretty much your cookie-cutter mystery/love story. The ending was a little bit predictable. But I don't regret reading it. It was fun while it lasted."
2,"""Unspeakable"" was ""an unspeakable disappointment""!","I have been a big fan of Sandra Brown's since my first book - Texas Trilogy. Up until this latest release I had always been a satisfied reader. I will admit that not all of her books have been on a scale of 10 (true 10's) but I've liked her humour and style of writing. This latest book was unnecessarily violent and at times crude which did not bring much to the story. Being a true fan I have not yet abandoned my favorite writer, but please note Sandra, that I don't care to purchase and read an other type of book like ""Unspeakable"" soon."
3,Ms. Brown used to be my favorite writer...,"'Unspeakable' is not that bad, although it is not nearly as good as her earlier mainstream novels. Ever since 'Charade' (my personal favorite, along with 'Mirror Image') her books have lost the 'touch' that made Ms. Brown unique. I look forward to the release of 'The Alibi' in paperback, the sneak preview I read looks very promising - steamy and entertaining, which 'Unspeakable', alas, is not."
2,I Tried...,"First let me say that I love Sandra Brown; I have read all her romances, and I loved ""Fat Tuesday,"" the first of her mysteries that I happened to pick up.But I could not, no matter how hard I tried, stick with ""Unspeakable,"" even though I read more than half the book. I had to force myself to pick it up; finally I gave up. This is a demented ""Of Mice and Men"" on a drug trip gone bad. I am not squeamish when it comes to graphic descriptions in a murder novel, but there is something about the descriptions in this book that turned my stomach, starting in the first pages with the description of a disembowling of a mouse. I simply could not go on; I felt sick.I skipped to the end, because I did have some curiosity about what finally happened, so I guess Brown had me hooked on some level. But not enough to keep me going."
1,It is not what we have come to expect from Sandra Brown,To be honest I could not get past the first chapter. I am so disappointed I usually can't wait for one of her books. I hear the next one is also not a romanctic suspense. Just a suspense. well they lost my $22.00
1,"It gets my vote for ""Worst Book of the Year""","This book was so boring, unrealistic, sappy, unbelievable, stereotypical, cliche filled, and ironic, it has to be the worst book I have read in the past 12 months. I listened to it on tape. The essiest way to read a book, and even then I had to struggle through it. The tornado at the end was to much...come on, be at least a little creative. The con's were straight out of hollywood (I work in a prison, no one is like these two idiots). The irony lies in the title of the book, nothing is Unspeakable in this garbage called a book."
1,terrible,"This is the first time I ever put a Sandra Brown book down in disgust. Not worth the time I spent reading it, a huge disappointment."
1,I disliked this book immensely.,"I have read all of Sandra Brown's books, and have loved them all. I have been a big fan of her's for a long time. This book is nothing like her other books. I feel she is trying to change her style from Romance to a more grotesque, crude form of murder mystery. I hope her next book will be more like her other novels and not like ""Unspeakable"". This book was a great disappointment to me."
1,Sadism as Entertainment...Not For Me,"This was reprehensible! A 14-year old girl being brutally sodomized and killed? Believe me, that's just the tip of the iceberg. This is supposed to be entertainment? To me this was the literary equivalent of a snuff film. Often while reading this book I found myself thinking less about the plot than about what kind of sick puppy could sit down and write this garbage. It honestly, truly disturbs me that this sadistic trash is what's being peddled to the reading public. I threw the book out because I couldn't stand the thought of having it under the same roof with me. I hope Browne has at least considered trying therapy. I would not want to meet her in person."
1,"Sandra, what has happened to you?????","I have read almost every book she has written and this was absolutely horrible! How can she call that a romance novel...it was disgusting and gruesome. The little bit of romance came around page 380. I wanted to quit reading it many times, but I kept thinking it would get better. It was so choppy...changing characters way too often. If this is Sandra's new trend in writing she has made a big mistake! Or, she needs to just call herself a mystery writer now. I agree with others that I would like to toss this book in the trash and never see it again!"
4,Awesome Book,The best Sandra Brown novel since Witness. The story was riveting and characters were very well written. It was a pleasure reading.
2,The ending was a let down,"Although I am a fan of Sandra Brown, I must admit I was disappointed with this book. The middle seemed too slow and when I got to the end I was extremely disappointed. It seemed as though the deadline was coming up fast and she needed to finish it quickly. I invested time in reading it and felt let down by the last chapter and Jack's speech at the end."
2,Crude and disgusting,I have read nearly all of Sandra Brown's books but this is the worst one she has written as far as being too graphic. The love story was good but the killing and preverted sex were not anything I care to read about.
3,So-so...,"I read the mixed reviews of this book and figured, what the heck, I'd try it out myself. As my rating indicates, I found the book satisfactory but not Ms. Brown's best. I can't really pinpoint what I didn't like, but I do know that after her love interest revealed his true character at the end of the book, I wondered why she didn't just walk out of his life..."
3,Took a while to get going.,"I was enjoying the book until I came to a place where all the power was out at this rural farm and the characters took long hot showers and baths. Water may be possible during a power outage in the city, but does not happen in rural areas. This distracted me from the story, making me feel that the author hadn't done her homework."
4,Very good easy reading!!!!,"This book was good. MUCH better than Exclusive and Fat Tuesday. Jack and Anna are fabulous in this book as are the other characters. I recommend this to people who don't like Heavy romance novels. It was part romance, part mystery. A perfect book in my eyes. I read it in 3 days!!!!!"
2,"Unspeakable just never ""got off the ground""","As a newcomer to Sandra Brown (having read Fat Tuesday and Exclusive) I had high hopes for this new release. Unfortunately, I was sadly disappointed. It took forever to ""set the stage"" and the thrill and excitement I had seen in her previous books was lacking here. Character development could have been better or at least more pointed.If this had been my first Sandra Brown I probably would not have gone back for more."
4,Enjoyable,"I had a good time reading this book and especially enjoyed the surprise ending. I thought the character development was well-done also, especially considering how many characters there were in the story. Not for those with a weak stomach, though, as some of the details are a bit graphic!"
1,The Worst of Sandra Brown,"Having read all of Sandra Brown's books and enjoying them, I was total disappointed with Unspeakable. I can't believe Sandra Brown wrote this trash. After reading the first twenty pages I knew this book was not for me. I forced myself to read 75 pages thinking it would get better. . .WRONG! I gave the book away just to get it out of my house, that's how bad it was. It was on the edge of being porno material. Don't waste your time and money!"
2,Missing something...,This was my first Sandra Brown novel. The first few chapters were s-l-o-w. This book did not hold my interest and I found myself reading this book only when I was using the bathroom.
3,It was okay but not good,I have read many of her books and really liked them. But this book really surprised me. It was really sad in a way it was also really violent and I have never read any books of hers where they were that violent and had that much bad language. But I did like the love story that went along with it. And the villan of the book was also very good but it was to violent for my liking.
4,My opinion...,"This is my first book by Sandra Brown, I picked it up after reading the synopsis on the back cover. I became immediately enthralled in the book and enjoyed it until the very end, wondering who the killer was. I'll admit though, about 3/4ths of the way through I had a guess, and it was correct. That's kind of cool though.Ok, I've read several reviews on this book that I am very disappointed with. I don't know if they are coming from people who have weak stomach's or what, but their comments are a little off base to me. I did not feel that this book was too gory or that it was overboard in the scenes. Sure the descriptions were down the tee, but isn't that what you want when you're reading a book? Do you honestly think that when you pick up a murder mystery book that some blood and gore are out of place? Isn't that what murder is? I just think it's unfair for those comments to deter people from reading this book that I thought was a great read."
2,Sickeningly Violent,"I gave it 2 stars because it kept my interest right up to the end. However, I'm starting to think the people who write these thrillers have a contest going to see who can come up with the most nauseatingly sadistic killers. I'm not exactly a wimp, but I had to skip over large chunks of the book to avoid reading the hidiously detailed rape and murder scenes. I cannot believe a woman could write about a 14-year old girl getting raped and sodomized just to ""jazz up"" her book. That's really low. It made me think, ""Anything for a buck, I guess."" Anyhow, it did keep me reading to the end but the disgusting language and violence made me wonder what kind of person Sandra Brown is."
2,"Gory, strange","Good because it's Sandra Brown, but gory, vulgar and it vaguely reminded me of the movie starring Jane Wyman: ""Johnny Belinda"".Sandra's written some really great books, but this one was too violent and descriptive of the rape scenes for me. As a woman author, she could've toned it down a little. We get the idea; no need to elaborate."
2,Not worth the time,"I have been a Sandra Brown fan and have read quite a few of her books. But I have to say ""Unspeakable"" really is not good and not worth the time to read it. The first 1/3 of the book developed slowly and lacked the building of suspense to keep me engaged. The whole plot in general was boring and disjointed. I really liked that she created a main character that was deaf but strong, caring, and intelligent. However, the whole book was just not an enjoyable read."
3,Expected something better!,"During the past 2 months, I have read 6 of Sandra Brown's romantic/thrillers and have become a big fan. This is the first time I have written a review. Unspeakable was harder for me to get through than Witness, French Silk, etc. It's a little darker and the character development is often slow. Carl was really evil and some of the crimes were pretty gross. The romance between Anna and Jack developed slowly and sweetly and finally reached a great crescendo! I appreciate that SB gave us some insight into the challenges of the hearing impaired and I loved the way that Anna and Jack communicated. This book is still worth reading, but not as satisfying as most of her other novels in the same genre."
4,Very original and entertaining!,"Very excellent read! Was on the edge of my seat! I love all of Sandra Brown's books and this work really proves that she is a great author with the ability to make you want to keep on reading until the very end. I will admit that some parts were a bit graphic, but that just shows that she is not afraid to overstep a few boundaries and try something different. I admire her talents for writing suspense/thriller/romance works. This really makes her worthy of the ""bestseller"" title."
4,exciting,"This book is exciting, relaxing and full of suspision. Other readers who are used to reading S.Brown and disappointed should relax a little in their life and let her explore. Gosh, do you eat the same food everyday? I was already putting actors/actresses with the characters of the book by the 2nd chapter...when's the television movie?..the little boy is great....carry on S.B."
2,reader,I have read many by this author and I was very disappointed with this one. I usually can't put her books down until I have read every word. This one was a struggle to finish. I felt she was so focused on trying to develop the plot that she forgot to develop the characters.
4,very entertaining and a good who donnit,"Unspeakable is a very good novel, with varying twists and turns that are not predictable for a typical murder mystery. good casual reading.you will have a tough time figuring this one out. good airplane book"
1,Unreadable,"I too Love Sandra Brown. A close friend of mine gave me two of her books one day- I read them and was HOOKED. I own about 40, I've read about 10 thus far, and I have to say that this one was the HARDEST. I too found it VERY HARD to stick with and finish ""Unspeakable,"" even though I had already made it half way through. I did finally force myself to finish, but did I mention how hard it was? There are so many stories to follow and so many characters to keep straight. It was very dry and very bla. I did not enjoy it AT ALL. The end is meant to throw you off, but it only left me flat. PLEASE SKIP THIS ONE. Read Two Alone (my personal favorite) or Exclusive instead."
1,TRASH CAN,"I have never stopped rreading a book when I am 100 pgs into it. But there always is a first. I was really disappointed in Sandra Brown, I have read most of books, especially her earlier romance novels. She was a witty sensual writer and I enjoyed her earlier work, but this book could not capture my attention. The characters were not interesting enough to keep reading. I'm glad I bought the paperback version. And I will have to agree with the reader from Rochester Minnesota, this book goes in the garbage. I wish Sandra Brown would go back to her original style and write romance. She wrote well and it was enjoyable. Her current style of writing is not enjoyable, and I don't think I will be buying any of her new books."
1,Storyline tolerable...unabridged audio.. downright painful,"The book was predictable and I found the characters hard to like I mean geez usually a poor victimized deaf/mute would be an automatic ""gimmee"" but no Anna just didn't do it for me. Jack was not a drifter with no base but more like a loser with one dimensional character where's the [good looking] texans' Ms. Brown usually gives us?? Now that being said onto the unabridged audio tape it was hard to keep track of characters and then there's no lead-in on the tapes so I think I actually skipped one tape (but it didn't matter so no bigge) John Henry Cox did the vocals and the whiney whiney groanie David character was done so well I really had to rethink my opinion on corporal punishment.."
5,A favorite gift,"My daughter received this book as a gift, and it instantly became her all-time favorite book. A dear friend added my daughter's name to the last page - a perfect personalization of a book that she really identifies with. The illustrations are exciting and vibrant, and the text is simple but meaningful (my daughter loves to ""read"" it to me or with me every time)."
5,Amazon reveiw,"Excellent book, my granddaughter and grandsons are requesting it all the time. It is colorful and well written and very interesting."
4,Drilling for Wiring without Hiring,"I purchased this, without the guide tool, to run CAT6 patch cable and RG-6 coaxial cable throughout my house. It definitely simplified the process, compared to what I've experienced in the past, and I'm overall pretty happy with it.My only complaint, though maybe this is alleviated by the guide tool, is that it is a bit more rigid than I'd prefer, making it hard to get it just where you want it. Maybe I'll buy the guide tool before my next project. This thing did the job, so that may be many years away..."
2,The book is out of date.,I agree with the reviewers comments concerning the necessity for an up date. I used the book with Visual Cafe 3.0 and found the examples would not compile and all the examples incorrect for the versions 2.5 and 3.0 of Visual Cafe. The book is now a source for Java but almost useless for Visual Cafe. I think it is imperative that the publishers list the version of Visual Cafe the book was written for. It is deceptive not to put the version on the cover of the book. This is the last Coriol book I will ever buy.
2,Visual Cafe for Java Explorer: Database Development Edition,The book was well written but did not cover the details I was hoping for. I was looking for specific details in connecting to a variety of database products and was disappointed that the book barely covered the Symantec DBAnywhere product.
3,This book is obsolete!,"The book is well written and the examples are easy to follow until you get to the database portion. It was clear from the examples that this book was not written for version 2.5a of JVCDDE! If you want do do more then just write Java apps and applets, such as database connectivity, then you are going to have to look elsewhere."
1,Absolutely inapprorpriate behavior is accepted in this story,"There is one section of this book that makes it not appropriate for any age. There is a part where a child's doll ""baby would not be quiet"". And the child said ""Oh, this is a bad baby. He needs to be washed."" It continues with ""And she began to wash her baby very hard"". OMG! What is that about???? This book is now in the shredder and should be removed from circulation...unless it can be re-released without this atricous part. How can anyone recommend a book that puts those kinds of thoughts in a child's head? Was this really OK in 1977 (when the book was released)? I don't know, but it's certainly not OK now."
4,Research,"I bought this for a research paper. Semi-hard to follow, but a good classic Christian book none the less. Good read."
2,headmasters sucked,"first of all the japs killed transformers if americans have seen this in the 80's transformers would have died okay prime was killed off again that was stupid, blaster and soundwave kill each other off just to be remade as twincast, and soundblaster, cybertron is blown up, ultra magnus is killed off, galvatron buried under ice by the headmasters, rodimus quits and gives the job to fort max and dANIEL NEEDS TO BE KILLED ALONGSIDE WHEELIE AND OH YEAH ARCEE still nurses daNIEL FINALLY THE SHOWDOWQN ON EARTH WHERE everybody fight and yeah zarak ejects from scorponoks body while scorp blows up and the autobots win the war and fort max and compant leaves the witwicky's on earth really sad for tf fans only."
4,Excellent read.,"Working to dispel the myths of ""the West's"" (really European, and Euro-American) climb to being the dominant world power. Kinda a hard read but I like that sorta thing."
1,DO NOT BUY! Bolts will snap like a pretzel!,DO NOT BUY! Bolts will snap like a pretzel! I was tightening the driver side mirror when the bolt snapped right off. I wasn't gorilla gripping it or anything. I was simply just repositioning them so I could ride with the doors off. This was only the third time that I had removed them and I have had these mirrors about 5 months.
1,crappy mirror,"this mirror is crap - screw stud pulled right out of mirror when tightening! also, mirror was poorly glued on the plate. Also, had 4 mirrir rucker point instead of 3 so I could not use the top ofthe mirror. Only option for just one mirrir I could find though. Chrome one is slightly better."
5,Great Book,"The book was great if you like science fiction. It is fast pace and exiting. The description of uncle Ambros's weirs mutated animals is great. The playhous is where most of the plot is. Time goes faster in the playhouse and that is how most of the farm animals died. There is a portal in the playhouse that spits out weird objects such as used tissue, bugs, or silver mouths. Overall this is just a great book."
5,William Sleator's best book,"This book is at the top of the list of books written by William Sleator. He shows a delicate relationship between two brothers, while placing it in a mystery that involves time and space and the relativity of both. It inspired me to be a Physics major, by showing me a new world where time and space are not quite as easily defined as we may like to think."
4,awesome,I am a newcomer to John Prine's work. This is an awesome cd and I definitely recommend this purchase.
3,"Not *bad*, exactly...","It's probably not possible for John Prine to make a bad album. But it is possible for him to make one that is not up to ""John Prine"" or ""The Missing Years"", or even ""Common Sense"". This disc, while of course containing many of Prine's well-known strengths, suffers on a few counts.First, Prine's voice is not in good form. There are reasons for this, of course, but, well, there it is. His voice lacks the flexibility to properly emote.Second, his famous and necessary sense of humor is rarely in evidence.Third, and most telling, where Prine at his best is oblique in his social commentary, usually getting more than one bird per stone, in this one he is direct, as if he feels he doesn't have the time any more for subtleties. This condescension is unbecoming to an artist of his stature.I'm still looking forward to his next, and am hoping he'll be back to his regular form."
1,Long long long term Prine fan.,"I have been listening to Prine for almost 30 years. I've been to see him many times.Bluntly, I wasn't impressed with this album. The melodies are recycled and the lyrics are maudlin. I missed the wit that others have identified.I'll be going to see him this Summer if he comes back to Wolftrap, but I hope he sticks to his standards."
2,"Same Shtuff, Different Day and CD","I have a lot of John Prine music and I've loved seeing him in concert many times. That said, I really don't have a lot of interest in a CD where the artist has run out of ideas and essentially re-works his older material. This might not be what other Prine fans want to hear, but just because I am glad he's seemingly beaten cancer, I am not going to praise this weaker piece of work. I would have liked to have heard something from John Prine which didn't sound like a song he'd previously released. I've already got his old music and to be asked to pay for a slightly re-worked version under the guise of new music doesn't cut it with me. On the other hand, if you're new to John Prine, you can buy either this or his older music and you'll probably be happy. Hopefully Prine will return to creating new music and not just marketing his older work in a new package."
2,Last Chance,"Johnny, what happened? A very whimpy John Prine, not the ""Sam Stone"" biting commentary I remember when. I bought this thinking I'd give Prine another chance. Unless he turns around on that road he's starting down, it'll be the last chance I give him."
1,Time for John to retire,"Like an athelete that played too long.... unfortunately John has played too long. I was/am one of the greatest fan of John's since I discovered him in the early 70s... seen him live a half a dozen times... I have all his albums and CDs... Unlike some of his masterpieces (like the Missing years), this album is very very disappointing... Unfortunately the lyrics lack creativity and the music is just a case of John taking his older songs and putting new words to them... I listened to the CD one time.... and sadly put it away... I am not sure why he did this. Maybe he needed money.... Still, I can seperate this CD from the others and excuse it... nothing John could do could now will change or tarnish his previous body of work.... but I will be extremely cautious before I buy a new CD from John if he makes another one.If you want to discover John... any of his earlier CDs will do..."
3,Fair and Square Review,"While I enjoyed the ""Jimmy Buffet"" like character, I could have done without the negative lyrics on the Iraq war. Also, the beat was pretty much the same throughout the CD."
5,Great Listening,John Prine is a wonderful storyteller and this CD allows him to further that goal.I recently introduced a friend to John Prine and she thinks his later works are more moving than the earlier CDs. I just love them all.
5,Fair & Square,I'm a John Prine fan I've been to one of his concerts and I think he's incredible. It's a great CD and I'm glad I bought it.
5,good country/folk music,"the CD was exactly what I expected it to be, I enjoy it everytime I play it."
5,Quintessential John Prine - wonderful!!!,"I've always been a John Prine fan so I must admit a strong bias toward his music, but even so I was literally STUNNED by how wonderful and beautiful and simple and rootsy and true this album is. It is just amazing that after more than 30 years of doing this sort of thing, he is still at his peak. And his voice has never sounded better -- it's richer and warmer than usual. Some of the songs here haunted me from the moment I heard them. With all these ""Americana"" acts out there trying so hard, he still does it better than any of 'em. Absolutely a five-star album."
4,Nice Work As Always,"I've got a number of Prine albums on vinyl and some of his later stuff, but this beats all. It's good to hear Prine's old country/folkish voice contrasted with Alison's. I've been waiting for some new stuff from him for awhile so it's really great to have this CD. Prine is amazingly creative with his lyrics (including his shot at Bush, which I appreciate) and one of the few artists who really seems to grasp the beauty of melodic music. One of my favorite songwriters of all time and this album certainly doesn't disapoint for Prine fans."
5,Dine on Prine,"A welcome feast from a gentleman too long gone - and almost gone too. Pathos, wry insight and the social conscience that intrigued me ever since Diamonds in the Rough. Don't spend a lotta time reading about the album. Buy it and wallow in the craft of a wordsmith. I saw Prine at Bonnaroo this year and once again came home and blew up my TV with tears of joy in my eyes."
3,A little mediocre from a guy so gifted,"I'm glad that John is back and this effort is refreshing in these days of the prepackaged and synthetically enhnaced. To be blunt, I wish there were more good songs on this album. However, there are enough very good tunes to keep me from regretting spending the money. ""Long Monday"" is as witty and moving as any of John's previous work. It's as great as ""Safety Joe"" is bad (actually, Safety Joe"" is so smelly that it may become a cult classic).So, buy it and enjoy the jewels amongst the litter..."
4,"I love the story so far, but...","I'm a couple of chapters in, and so far there hasn't been a single quotation mark in the Kindle version. It makes it a bit annoying when following conversations. I'm reading it in a Kindle app, and not on an actual Kindle, so that might have something to do with it, although I didn't have this problem with his first book in the series: ""Graverobbers Wanted"" Also an excellent book that I strongly recommend."
4,Pretty good speakers if you have a new Mac,"First of all, these speakers look awesome! The audio quality is pretty good when you listen to a CD. However, if you want a lot of bass for movies or something you should buy the SoundSticks product. The Apple Speakers do give off pretty good bass for their size though. Mine came with my computer and I probably wouldn't have bought them if they didnt come with it."
1,Mini-Jack Woes,Like another person - I got these speakers to use with an older Mac - G3 - only to find out the Mini-Jack did not fit on my Mac. A trip to Radioshack did not solve the problem and neither Apple or Amazon could direct me to an appropriate adapter. They are going back.
2,Did not like.,"These had a very gross after taste that I could not get out of my mouth. I purchased the honey-stung, not going to order again."
3,In my opinion not as good as the short shots,Had a decent taste but the short shots seem to pack a lot more flavor
1,INGREDIENTS,"What they don't tell you: The first three ingredients are: Beef, Beef Hearts, Water. They also include Monosoldium glutamate (MSG) and corn syrup. I wish I had known what was in these."
3,S/P shakers,"Has some flaws on the glazing including drips. The quality is, ok. Didn't bother returning them because it's not worth the time. They were recieved on time."
1,Arrived broken.,"Thought it was a nice little memento, so I sent it as a gift, but it arrived broken much to my chagrin."
1,Cheap and Leak,These are made of plastic. They both leak out of the seams where the plastic is welded together. Find something else.
1,hole problem,The holes in both salt and pepper shakers are to big and let too much salt or pepper out at once.
1,"very very small, not as expected",got this product poorly packed and to my surprise it was very small indeed all for a price of $11.98. Of course i wasnt very pleased with this item.
1,Poorly packaged,"I bought these adorable salt and pepper shakers as a gift for my mother-in-law. They arrived quickly, but poorly packaged and damaged beyond recognition. Our only recourse is to have HER return the package for a refund. They should just send her a new set. Well, I will get my money back, and buy these elsewhere."
3,Cute but Broken,"The salt and papper shakers were exactly as described and pictured, however the arm of the pepper shaker was broken when I received them. It wasn't worth returning them."
2,Arrived with scratches,"My wife and I love the original Hug salt and pepper shaker. We decided to get this version on amazon b/c it was a good deal cheaper, but we were disappointed to find that it had scratches on it upon arrival. In particular, the scratches were noticeable on the black one, which just can't work, even at a bargain price."
2,"cute, but a little disappointed","These are super cute, but the holes are huge and the salt/pepper POUR out way too fast!! I wish I had of read the reviews before I bought it. Shipped quickly though."
2,Not a superior gift,"The actually item looks very different from the picture. As the review suggests, it's NOT made of ceramic and the plastic looks cheap. The design is interesting but I don't think it's a good idea for a superior gift. And don't bother if it's over 10 bucks-you will regret it."
1,Different Product Shipped,"When I received the product, it was slightly different from the original ""Hugs"" salt and pepper shown in the picture. The eye holes are much larger than the original, causing too much salt to come out! :) I was not very happy with the product, and advise others to purchase the original version from the MoMA design store, rather than this cheap knock-off."
1,Misleading,"I ordered these salt and pepper shakers for a christmas gift. I searched everywhere for a decent price and thought this was the winning set (little did I know it wasnt)I waited a good 3 weeks in anticipation for them to arrive. When the day finally came, I unwrapped the box and to my surprise was two cheap looking shakers. In the pictures they looked cermamic and not plastic (they are plastic). You could see the slits in the sides and the eyes were HUGE holes. I wish I had read some reviews before purchasing them. Hopefully this helps future buyers. These are not what you want!!"
2,China special,"I bought this with intentions of giving it as a gift. There is no way I would ever give someone this the way it came, a tiny generic brown box! These were ceramic not plastic like some people are saying, but I ended up getting a different gift since this was underwhelming"
3,Probably the weakest of the Furman UK stories,"I consider myself a huge fan of the Simon Furman, and his run on the Marvel UK Transformers book is legendary. However, the stories collected in ""City of Fear"" are more filler material and do not really have a coherent theme. Even worse, this book features a lot of artwork by Dan Reed, who I consider to be the worst artist to have worked with Furman and an awful artist in his own right. The stories themselves are not bad, but they unfortunately are not particularly memorable. I would recommend waiting to purchase this volume only after completing the rest of the run."
2,"Some Gems, some lemons...","I bought this for ""coconut island,"" a brilliant herbie hancock cover. The songs that came from the ""americanization"" album are really great and inspired. The songs that came from the ""lasting impressions"" session are dreadful and tonedeaf."
5,one of the best Masekela CDs available,"This is a great CD of some of Hugh Masekela's earlier work. His new stuff (circa 90s) is a little cheesy, but this is great, very unique style. His stuff from the 60s is the best that I've heard. Check out his album Stimela, also available here. Besides that, the best material remains to be released on CD. I hope to see a re-release of his album, Home Is Where the Music Is. That's the best but it's not available on CD, I don't think."
3,Great jazz album but....,I really enjoy the Jazz works on this album. It's a fresh dose of African- and Latin-American-infused Jazz alongside some American classics as well. My only problem is that the sound quality on this mp3 download leaves something to be desired. It was an eerie reminder of the sound of casette tapes that had been subject to a minor magnetic field. I'm not sure if this is due to the mastering/recording or if it was a technical issue related to downloading mp3 files.
3,Bios of those who happen to be extras,"Interesting in its own right, the DVD is more about the lives of several people whose lives are all about being movie extras. I would have preferred more details on the nuts and bolts and behind the scenes details of being a background player, but still liked this DVD, nonetheless."
3,My daughter loved it... for 5 minutes,I bought this for my 3-year-old daughter last year for Christmas and she seemed really excited when she opened it but then she completely lost interest and never played w/ it. She loves Blues Clues so I thought it was a good gift... I tried to show her how fun it was and that it talked but she didn't care. Now it's going to Goodwill. At least SOME child will like it....
4,"Nice Toy, Picture is deceiving","This ""So Much To Say Blue"" is a fun toy, but the picture is deceiveing. From the picture it looks like blue is made from a smooth type material, but really she's made out of a more fuzzy material. I was hoping that she'd be fuzzy, since I had seen pictures on other sights, and luckily she was. But for other people who want a blue that is made out of smoother cottony material, the picture is very deceiving."
5,a fun interactive toy,"my daughter recieved this toy for chriatmas, she also recieved the bedtime blue, this is by far her favorite. she loves it when blue ""talks to her"" blue asks questions. it's really a cute and wonderful toy, especially for toddlers who are learning how to respond to questions and hold conversations."
5,Some books exist. These live.,"Anne of Green Gables may be L.M. Montgomery's best-known book, but it doesn't deserve to be. While Anne is somewhat superficial and Pollyanna-ish, Montgomery gave Emily all the light and darkness of a living being. Emily's character is developed through her own eyes as she writes in her journal, but a hillarious, pathetic, wise, and unforgettable supporting cast prevent the books from being to introspective.Montgomery does occasionally fall into her besetting sin of over-flowery descriptions, but they in no way detract from the haunting beauty of this series."
3,"Really good, but has problems. 3 AND 1\2 stars","EMILY OF NEW MOON is really good. I like writing, so I can identify with Emily. Emily's adventures are cool, and I like the part where she can see what really happened to Illse's mother (Illese is her friend). I like the mischief Emily stirs up when she meets a Catholic priest. But sometimes it was just boring and predictable!!!! Some of the dialogue was stupid, and I thought ""Jarback"" Priest--Dean--was a flat character. It's a good book, but not as good as Anne."
3,Not All It's Cracked Up to Be,"As an avid Anne fan, I found myself disappointed with the first Emily book. I understand that many people believe Emily to be more realistic than Anne, but she struck me more as insufferable and spoiled. For some reason, I found the events of her life to be uninteresting and nearly didn't finish the book because it was such a drag to read. Perhaps this book is more suitable for younger readers around Emily's age, while Anne's is a more timeless saga that will enchant even the older set. All in all, I found Emily and her story to be extremely childish and boring, although L.M. Montgomery's fine writing skill still shined through, which is why I gave the book 3 stars."
2,ABRIDGED EDITION -- don't be fooled!,"First, I would like to state that Emily of New Moon is one of my all time favorite books (and series). However, this particular edition has been abridged -- great stuff has been edited to make it shorter for younger readers. While this edition will give you an idea of Emily, please read the full unshortened version! I read the original when I was about 11, and I certainly would have enjoyed it read aloud to me years earlier. If you want to introduce your child to to L.M. Montgomery, go for the real thing, not the shortened version!"
5,For Younger Readers,"First, I'd like to point out that the second novel is better by leaps and bounds. Now, back to this one. I'll put it shortly: last year, I loved it, laughed and cried, felt that Emily was a genius and that her aunt was a witch, etc., etc.; but this year I can relate more with her aunt than Emily, get pretty irritated at E's childish thinking and feel she's a little spoiled. The only thing I like at age 13 about this book is the character set alone--they're amazing. However, I don't think the situations live up to them. Anyway, at age 11-12 it will likely be the best book you'll read, and nourishing food for the imagination. After that, you grow out of it."
1,Beware!,Beware! Alot of the recipes have milk and cheese in them. Birds are lactose intolerant so those recipes can make them very ill.
1,IS NOT SUITABLE FOR PARROTS AFTER ALL,"Gourmet Bird Food Recipes: IS NOT SUITABLE FOR PARROTS AFTER ALLQuotation out of the book:'No one knows exactly what a well balanced diet for a bird is, but experts are coming closer to understand....'My appraisal is:.... that gratiné, the use of butter and salt like in penne in cream sauce, the reccomended Italian dressing, or garlic butter is miles away from a healthy diet for parrots. And I never provide a sort of these suggested menues to my fosterlings. I even must say, that these recipes are unhealthy - possibly even noxious. Oh dear!Not recommended at all!If your intention is to cook for your bird 'Healthy Bird Cookbook' by Robin Deutsch is a good reference."
5,Fantastic Cookbook for Bird Lovers!,"I bought this book when I got my African Grey parrot. Eight years later and I've had to replace it because I got ""goop"" all over it! I have not only used it all the time, I've bought it as a gift for all my bird loving friends! My grey girl loves all the recipes! I highly recommend this cookbook for all of our avian friends!!!"
4,Came chipped but still worth it,"When this arrived the sides of the base were chipped in a couple places, but I figured the wait time for a new one wasnt worth it. I use it about every weekend and it is great! I think the beeping to tell you when it is done isn't accurate and unfortunate that you cannot turn it off. It's very easy to clean and even if you make a mess it all just wipes off, even burnt berry bits"
4,6 waffle iron,"Although it doesn't heat quite evenly, I do enjoy using this waffle iron. So much faster than my old 2-waffles-at-a-time waffle iron."
5,A great book to read. I loved it.,I chose this rating because I loved it. I loved everything about this book. I would recommend this book to book clubs. It is a book that definitely will hold your interest to the very end.
5,Just gets better,After reading the first two books I couldn't wait to start this one. I had a hard time putting it down. I am concurrently doing a Bible study of the book of Amos and Isaiah. This series really adds a lot.
5,Addicting series!,"By the third book, I was completely addicted. This series ranks up there with the Mark of the Lion series by Francine Rivers! The faith of some of the characters in the books is so convicting! I am so thankful that I read these books, and will read them again! Start with book 1 though, for the full story!"
3,Good read but not best,"I got this book in large print. So I don't really know if the book felt childish because of the large print or not. Maybe, I was too close to the work to see it from the distance.I was expecting much more from the writer. It seems that the writer concentrated a lot on developing a few characters, but the writer forgot to create settings. It's like watching the actor's emotions and listening to the actor's spoken words without any background. Emotions and words can create a lot of images, but you feel cheated if there isn't any background. I have felt like zooming in to the characters' souls and staying very close there by not having the option of zooming out to see the surroundings. The writer did create some settings but not enough.Also, the author tried a bit too hard with the dialogues. She quoted psalms and bible lessons through dialogues that did not feel natural.I was expecting an epic, but the story was written for elementary students."
4,Good...,"You will mostly enjoy this book if you love biblical history or if you would like to understand it better.First, the writting is not as smooth as more experienced authors I've read. In some places its even a bit jarring. BUT Ms Austin is certainly one thing.....a storyteller!!!I found myself reading this book and really understanding human nature versus obeying God. It made me repent of some of my own thickheadedness and at other points it made me pray not to fall into the traps that I saw the characters fall into.Ms Austin has worked good cause and effect into her plotting of this book. Keep up the good work Ms Austin. All in all it was a good read that makes you look introspectively at yourself and hey....thats what every author wants to accomplish...right? 8-)"
5,Loved This Series,Couldn't put it down! I love the insight Lynn gives you into the lives of the Kings and how she tells it in such an intriguing story format! I totally recommend reading this whole series. Awesome!!!
5,The story continues,Lynn Austin has done an incredible job bringing the story of Hezekiah to life by adding the details of daily life in Jerusalem so many centuries ago. Her attention to detail and her accuracy to the Biblical accounts is amazing. Looking forward to continuing the series.
5,Love Lynn Austin,This book is a great book from a great series from one of my favorite authors. The price was right and it arrived quickly.
1,A John Brown Biographer and Scholar,"Despite its fine cinematic qualities, this is more an adventure in imagination and interpretation than it is a responsible historical documentary. For all of its efforts, it does not convey a sense of the man who lived, but rather the man who haunts the imaginations of those who understand him the least.Unfortunately this documentary--so lauded as an excellent portrayal of Brown in biographical terms--is weighted down too heavily by the opinions of novelists and lacks a respect and balance in portraying Brown's religious orientation. The film omits key themes with respect to his working with blacks, and overall conveys the ivory tower biases that are so hard to challenge due to the politics of media and academia, despite the facts of history. Of course, the producer is a filmmaker, not a biographer, but certainly if people want to learn about John Brown of history, this is not the place to start.Louis A. DeCaro Jr.John Brown biographer and researcher"
3,Great knowledge,I did receive knowledge of John Brown and why he was recorded in history.This DVD was a documentary without any real video. But the information was good.I would prefer shorter documentary without any real video.
5,Beautiful Joe a childhood memory,Actually I read Beautiful Joe's Paradise first then Beautiful Joe. These books really bring back some childhood memories. Beautiful Joe was a beautiful collie. As a child Beautiful Joe was my very close companion. Reading the two books in chronological order is probably best.
1,Beautiful Joe,"The book that I ordered arrived in a timely manner, and in good condition. However, the print size in this particular paperback book was so small that it was very difficult to read. Make sure which book you order."
1,DO NOT READ THIS BOOK,"For some strange reason which I have never been able to figure out, my mother gave me this book to read as a child. I was emotionally scarred by reading this book about dog-torture, and I have never recovered. PARENTS: PLEASE DO NOT LET YOUR CHILDREN READ THIS BOOK! I do not know why a book about a poor little dog being horribly tortured and nearly killed makes for a good children's book. Please do not inflict the pain and torment upon your children that was inflicted upon me. Spare your children this horror."
2,Lots of typos in this version...,"I ordered this book because it was quite a bit less than the other versions available. I wish I had looked at the preview and read the ""disclaimer"" on the first page. This is basically an unedited scan of the book, so the text is full of typographical errors (problems with text recognition and punctuation). I have not yet read the entire book, but in looking at the first few pages, I can already tell that it will be irritating to read this version. It will be similar to reading email from people that use no punctuation, capitalization, or spell-checking. I just hope that it does not detract too much from the story, which I am sure is good. If I find that reading this version gets to be too challenging, I will purchase another (regular) copy."
5,This book will please both boys and girls who love animals.,I have just taken the original book down from my bookcase to read to my 8 year old daughter. My mother bought this book for me when I was 8 and all 3 of my daughters have enjoyed it. Its right up there with Black Beauty! An excellent story!
5,Lessons on decency through the eyes of a dog.,"This book profoundly affected me as a child. As many youngsters are passionate about animals, this book teaches everyday values as told through the eyes of a dog. In a world where respect for human life is not always apparent, this book appeals to the humane spirit in all. By teaching kids to first love and respect animals, they can become better individuals. I turned off the t.v. last summer, and read this book to my 11 and 8 year old children. They loved it!"
5,Beautiful Joe,"Beautiful Joe is a great book in the tradition of Black Beauty, and will educate today's readers of not only the history of animals' roles in society but also will bring to light the history of our country prior to mass automobile usage. A great book that still rings true today."
2,mini bag,"So disappointed in this backpack. No where in it's description did it say that this was a mini backpack. Can't use it when my son begins school which is what I bought it for. Fine, if you want something to carry a lunch in."
3,page turner,A good novel. What I would call a holiday read. If you read James Herbert then you already know what I mean. Thumbs up rather than down on this one.
1,Terrible,"Used to love Herbert books - haven't read one in an age. Then tried this one. Bad mistake, tainted the memory of past reads.Boring story that hangs around way too long when the decent thing to do was to end."
2,Good idea -- tedious delivery.,"Herbert had a good idea here, but his delivery is so agonizingly tedious that I hated him by the end of the book. I'm one of those people who can't quit in the middle...If I were, I would have. He can take many pages to describe in the dryest manner some of the most uninteresting things...even things like describing exactly how the person's fingers wrap around an object in order to pick it up. So many times I simply wanted to scream ""Get on with it man!!!"" The two stars are for his imagination. The idea of a person dying while of on an OBE was fascinating in itself. There were horrifying moments, but I had difficulty relating to the characters and the ultimate resolution was less than satisfying."
2,99.9% theory and only 0.1% samples of what the theory is!,"I was surprise to review the book and found chapter after chapter that the topics were of interest but no examples, invented or from the real world. No working exercise with the proper examples nor recommendations of formats of applied concept! I am confused!!"
4,good pull trainer for swimmers,"Firm foam holds up under poolside conditions. Makes the workout more of a challange, as leg strengh required to keep float in place."
4,Great Massage Therapy Soundtrack,"I use this album and other Gandalf albums in my practice of massage therapy. They are relaxing, and not repetitive enough where you get sick of them quickly. Good soothing music to help you relax and meditate too."
5,Perfect for the price,I wanted an inexpensive kiddie pool for my daughter to make a ball pit. Since it is in the middle of the winter amazon was my only option. For $13 this price cant be beat. It is inflatable (so see if you can find a pump) and the ball and inner tube are great add on pieces
4,A very good family film...,"This is a great movie for the whole family to watch! I don't usually watch movies like this, but this one was enjoyable. Whenever the dog smiled, it looked very real, I wonder if he really did. The little girl in this movie, reminded me alot of Dakota Fanning, she did a great job. It got a little corny towards the end, but it was still very good. If you're looking for a great family movie, everyone will enjoy this one!"
4,A sweet movie,A movie with a moral and a really cute dog. The dog is probably the best part of the movie.
4,Because of Winn - Dixie,"This wonderful movie sounds really,really,really good!!!!!When it comes to DVD i'm so going to get it!!!!!i'm reading the book by:Kate DiCamillo and im in page:118!!!!!!I just got the book yesterday!!!!"
2,Because of wind Dixie video download,"I paid for the video download and I was not able to find it on my school computer where I downloaded it too, so I did not even view it. I do not know if the product was good or not. Not Amazons problem....."
5,Winn Dixie,I think this is a great movie. I teach fourth grade. We read the book and then watch the movie for comparison. The students love the book and the movie.
4,Girl and Dog Show,"You can't go wrong with cute little girls and their mangy dogs. Rent for the whole family. Watch it repeatedly. The kids will anyhow.Also, Cicely Tyson and Eva Marie Saint are having a wonderful time with their character roles. Go girls."
5,What a surprise!,"I'll be honest, I went to see this movie because it has Dave Matthews in it and I am a fan of everything he is involved in, and I wasn't expecting much from this movie. Turns out the story was amazingly good (considering it was a movie intended for a younger audience, you'd think it would be sappy and poorly acted), it had real issues and real heart to it. One and only disappointment...they do not plan to release this on DVD or VHS from what I have heard, and it is definitely a movie than can be better-appreciated upon multiple viewings. At least if you cannot own it, go see it in the theater just once. A film everyone should see."
4,Good family movie,"I actually purchased this movie in a combined package that included the book, but there are so many elements that are best viewed in a movie, that I can't help but recommend the movie itself.Perhaps as a pastor myself I understand the perspectives better, or maybe it is just that my Dad moved a lot when we were kids that I can relate to being in a new community.Moments that stand out in the movie:The bottles in the tree that speak to the haunting of one memberWinn Dixie joining with the singingThe approaching storm and the panic of Winn Dixie related to thunderThis is very much a family movie and I recommend it."
5,Excellent Family Film-Not To Be Missed,"When you think of a dog movie, you think, ""Oh, it's just a dog who steals the show."" Not in this case.Annasophia Robb plays the lonely Opal, who is a newcomer to the town of Naomi. She gives an okay performence. She wasn't the best ever, but she never fails to make me go, ""She's actually good."" at some points.Dave Matthews plays the superb pet shop owner Odis. You will swoon for his amazing talent. I mean, for just his first film, he was excellent. Never ceases to amaze me.Cicely Tyson plays the town ""witch"" who actually turns out to be a sweet old...alcholic. But, nevertheless, Opal meets her in confrontation. In a result, she becomes Opal's third best friend in Naomi. What an amazing performence!I laughed and cried at Because of Winn-Dixie. Never should this film be taken as just a ""little kid's"" movie. This is the best movie I have seen since The Incredibles and Finding Neverland. Not to be missed."
4,a really great mivie!!!!,"this movie is one of my favorites.along with lemony snicket,raise your voice,polar expres and many others.best cleaniest movie i've seen this whole year and has a great message for everyone."
2,"Not fun for kids, not entertaining for adults","I don't understand the marketing plan for this movie. Is it meant to be for children? It's not funny -- in fact, it's maudlin. It's like ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" with a dog and fewer lesbians. Is it meant to be for grown-ups? Then ... why wasn't it more entertaining?Jeff Daniels was barely there. The dog was very cute, but he didn't get enough screen time.Just not a very good movie.On the plus side: Little cussing, no violence, no peril, no sexuality. But why waste 2 hours of your life on it?"
2,Looks really young,"I'm almost 13 (will be in a little over a month.) The first minute I saw this, I knew that it looked like one of those movies 7-8 year old girls would love. I'm over this kind of movie with the cutesy dog and the cutesy girl. The actress is 11, but she looks like 7. I do enjoy movies with dogs, like Air Bud. Those are much better. I'm not really interested in seeing this movie. After all, right now I'm more into comedy and this just seems like a boring little kid's movie. Just look at the picture Amazon provides...I would just be really humiliated to be in a theater with 5-8 year olds, laughing their heads off at something boring. I'm beyond this. If you're 10 or over, then I'd probably recommend something different."
2,Pollyanna Gets A Dog,"Girl lonely and sad, has to leave friends because her dad moves from town to town to preach in a convenience store. Finds a dog, credits dog with making friends for her (dog causes lots of trouble). Silly and simplistic, for ages 5 - 10 only."
1,The Dog Saves It From Being NO Star,"Too much little girl and not enough dog. This movie should have been titled 'Because of Opal'. Plot excruciatingly dull. Very unsubtle proselytizing. Truly unpleasant movie masquerading as a feel good flick. I only gave this film one star because I love dogs, otherwise, it deserves NO stars.What a stinker!"
4,good adaptation,A good adaptaion of the book Anna Shopia does a great job in her first live action movie.
5,Winn Dixie,"I purchased this for my 8 year old granddaughter. She told me she had read the book in her class and loved it, we started talking about the movie and she said she would love to see it to see how close it was to the book. Well now she will know. The movie arrived quickly and it was well worth the money"
5,Students use it on the kindle,"This was a whole group read, so I downloaded it to my Kindle for my students to follow along. They loved using it on the iPad!"
5,Great family film!,"First of all i have been looking for this now since it came out, i managed to get one off ebay. It is brilliant! i would reccommend it for all the family to enjoy. The characters were the best eevr they could have chose, the plot was fab too!I enjoy watching family films and i was so into buying this when i saw that ANNASOPHIA was in it, i am glad i did. WATCH IT!"
5,"A nice ""clean"" movie","I liked this movie, I did not really get the few negative reviews. My kids ages 6 and 8 liked it too. It gets discouraging that it is so hard now days to find a movie that actually does not have cussing or sexuality in it. Even Disney movies have things inappropriate for children at times, and I am not prude. This is a movie a teacher could actually show in a classroom, my son watched it in 2nd grade. It is heartwarming and the dog is adorable.The only negative thing I would say was the sheriff deputy. I guess the writers were trying to make his parts funny, but they came off as really dumb. I can overlook that though, because I liked the rest."
5,Great Film,"I was forward deployed for Operation Iraqi Freedom, and this movie came to the theater trailer. I was the only one in the theater (thank god) i thought of my daughter at home and got a bit sad. This is such a great movie. Dave Matthews plays a great part, very true character. The movie is not too sappy or childish... now that i am home, i cannot wait till it is on DVD so i can see it with my Daughter!"
4,Because of Winn Dixie,"This is a great family film. Being an animal lover, I was delighted with the antics and reactions of the dog, Winn Dixie. If you like people, this movie shows many ways to reach out to others and bring them together into the seemingly most unlikely of friendships. Very entertaining and wholesome."
5,Heartwarming!,What a wonderful family movie. There is nothing bad whatsoever in this movie. As a special treat viewers get to hear Dave Matthews sing (He is AWESOME). This movie tells the story of Opal and her best friend Winn Dixie. Opal's is the preachers daughter who's Mother left when she was 3. Very sad at times but also very heartwarming.
4,Not a Sappy Kid's Movie,"I avoided this movie at first, because the trailers made it seem like a silly kids movie about a smiling dog. I was pleasantly suprised to find that it is a good story about a lonely kid in a small town. It is a good movie for the whole family to see together."
3,Heavy for a kids movie,"What a great story of a young girl dealing with death, loneliness, and small town life, but a heavy subject for kids. Winn Dixie, her adopted dog and best friend, is very entertaining and sure to make the younger audience happy to have sat through it, but it is doubtful that they will grasp the full extent of the film. Cute for an adult. Long for kids."
2,not the best movie in the year..............................,"because of winn dixie is a little borring and a little sad.annsopia robb was not that good.she was keep saying""winn dixie""in a very stupid vioce.although the 4 year olds lauged at every scene and their laughs were so weired that i lauged with them.so don't blame me.winn dixie was very good at smiling.it was a good plot,but i was a little to old for this.i reccamend you to read THE NOVEL."
3,it's okay........,because of winn dixie is a good movie.i'm not sure if it is the best.i don't like it how opal remebers her memoriy thingy.that's mostly why that i put three stares.because of winn dixie is a 50/50.
2,I had no idea it was a drama!,I'd never heard of the book seies until this year when a friend had to read the books for class.. I saw this movie a few days ago and I was so happy i wasen't a silly movie for little kids. It's sort of a girls version of My Dog Skip - although I don't think the dog in Because of Winn Dixie is that cute. This movie has a biit of a heart to it and it made me cry a few times.
3,work in progress,My order was not done correctly so I sent an email to provider. They were very quick to resolve the issue. I am not super happy with the initial order but am happy with resolution. Customer service is very quick to fix mistakes. I would order from them again.
5,Love my monkey,I just love him in my living room. The colors are bold but not overbearing and it's a cute talking piece.
5,Love My Monkey!,"I'm very pleased with my poster :) It looks amazing, as well as the 3 other posters I ordered from them. I got lucky and none of them were smashed while being delivered, and I cannot wait to frame them and hang them up!"
4,"Great, kinda.","I received my poster just yesterday, I framed it up and popped it on my wall, looks great! Nice, full size. ONE ISSUE, and it's not the fault of the shipper by any means. But in the process of shipping somehow the box got bent! So if you can imagine it left a big ugly crease on my poster. But, not the shippers fault. Love the poster."
5,"Great ""Straight""","While the reviewer below was trying to be helpful, it has backfired since he only gave this title one star. ""Straight, No Chaser"" is an excellent live document of Joe with the Wynton Kelly Trio in the years immediately following his stint with Blue Note. Along with ""Four,"" this recording sat in the vaults for close to 30 years before being issued on CD by Verve. Normally, I would say this is a four-star disc, as the material is mostly standards and not as adventurous as the Blue Note albums. But I have no qualms awarding five here to offset the earlier one star rating. Great sound from a great group in a great era -- we'll miss you Joe."
4,creme savers sugar free,"I've lost 65 pounds in 7 months on the no sugar no flour diet. This candy is my crutch when I need something sweet.It gets me thru many a dayCrème Savers Sugar Free Strawberry & Crème Hard Candy, 2.75-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)"
4,Nice cage,Good looking clean line cage. I have 2 parakeets and they love it. Plenty of room and toys they like to play with. A great purchase.
4,Very good for eMac,"Worked very well for the eMac I bought for my daughter from a place in Portland called Free Geek. I recommend the vendor and Free Geek for anyone near the Portland, OR area."
3,Nothing more than mediocre.,"This early novel by Jim Thompson is narrated by Joe Wilmot, a smalltown movie theater operator whose reputation as a chiseler is disputed by few. Joe rather unwisely gets himself involved in a love triangle of sorts. One where all three participants have murder on their mind.The plot of Nothing More Than Murder is irritatingly rambling with too many digressions into the arcania of film distribution and exhibition. The dialogue is well crafted but the characters themselves fail to ring true.Readers electing to skip this particular Thompson offering will not be missing much."
4,What? A Mystery?,"Not my favorite Jim Thompson, but with a kind of standard mystery ending. Not his usual extreme noir self. Still good, with a rather improbable ending regarding Carol."
5,good Movie,this movie is kind of whats gonna happen soon with the new world other and what the prophecies states so you might watch it
3,another good folk rock,an english folk rock with Mandy Morton as a lead singer.She has a lovely voice. The music is folky with touches of progressive music. The lyrics are wonderful.The record is originally from 1977.If you want to learn more about this band you can go to - www.geocities.com/fantasticmandy/The quality of the music is excellent.The band has 4 records - including Magic lady whith the title song dedicated to Sandy Danny.
3,"Interesting subject, difficult book","I read this book halfway through. The subject is very interesting and makes totally sense. But since English is not my first language, the reading is quite tough.The book provides a lot of background information regarding accounting, which our accounting professor didn't bother to talk about. For example how the guilds were organized in the dark ages in Europe (and still are organised in Germany of today).You should have some background in process automation and cybernetics or accounting."
2,Better on screen,"I have wonderful memories of Tom Poston in the movie Zotz! I looked forward to this book to re-experience that on the page, but it dragged and just missed the mark for me. I guess I'm spoiled by the movies.The story developed with an alluring hook of a magical notion from the ancient past. Once this was fleshed out, the story just hit the mud. All I remember is the tedium of this mundane character trying every avenue of government he could think of to get someone else to take it off his hands. Boring!Every child dreams of having that kind of power at their disposal.It ends up in the anti-climax of water drifting into the gulf after a thousand mile journey down the Mississippi - diffuse and anonymous."
4,LUGOSI ESTATE VERSION!!!!!,"Another great release from the Lugosi estate. Print quality is down a little from the first release, but is probably as good as it gets. Apparantly, there are no more to come, which is a very sad state of affairs. My greatest wish would be for the Lugosi Estate to release some of his other public domain films that are so hard to get a decent release of. The special features are excellent."
3,Bela's Dual Life,"Bela Lugosi is a distinguished professor but he also leads a dual life where he runs a mission for the Bowery homeless (reminds me of his Dark Eyes of London - 1939). His victims are disposed of in the basement, which is, laid out as a cemetery and beneath the graves lay a sub chamber where zombie like people are kept and in the end, that is where Bela tries to hide from the law. Not a good choice!The quality of the DVD is fair."
5,Will's review,This movie is my all time favorite movie bela lugosi's acting shines. The story line is one that is very intrigueing and unforgetable after seeing this i never looked down upon b-films again.
1,Everyone's got to have a hobby.,"I can't believe people gave this movie 5 stars. 5 stars? Really? Citzen Kane, The Godfather, . . . Bowery at Midnight. Hmmm.Bela is a professor who works in the Bowery feeding the homeless. He also employs a mad scientist who in turn employs a bunch of dead guys to wander around in the soup kitchen basement.I know this sounds intriguing. However, Bela seems unaware of the zombie workers he has at his disposal. Bela does not dispatch zombies to commit crimes. Bela does not use zombies to work in his sugar mill (White Zombie reference). Bela is simply a kindly professor by day, and ruthless gangster by night.I don't know when the guy fit in sleep, keeping his marriage together,and maintaining his dual professions. How does Bela have time to publish anything in journal articles? Why do other crooks follow orders from some ivory tower type with an accent?Still, this movie is cheaper than renting this movie more than one time."
2,"Matthew Montgomery is hot. Well, that's about it...","Being gay, I always want to like gay movies. And I probably rate higher on a gay movie on its straight counterpart. So I was thinking I should give this one a 3-star just for the effort. Somehow I just couldn't bring myself to it.You read my review title, so you know how I feel about the movie. At times I felt I couldn't decide whether the director meant for it to be funny, or it's just so bad that it's becoming funny. One advice for the director: Take a lesson from Jonah Markowitz, the director of ""Shelter"", a movie that in my opinion is everything how a gay movie should be."
2,"not really bad, but not good either","boring storyline,boring actors, sometimes really bad acting, I actually really suffered through this movie. It is 83 min. long, but I had the feeling I was sitting in front of my TV for about 4 hours until this movie ended. There were a few moments when I thought the story gets better, but after all it was a real dissapointment. This is one of the movies, you see and after 1 day you don't remember anything about it."
2,Looks like a Cheap Production,"Plot is ok in the first half of the movie and the guy who does the drug-dealer is maybe too good for this kind of movie. It's embarrasing to watch. None of the guys is as ugly as they look on the cover of the DVD, but that doesn't mean they are hot. It had very good ideas, but it was all spoiled with low budget settings, effects and truly poor acting from most of the actors. Watching it was like watching a movie made about an Alternate Universe fanfic of whatever book or series or movies out there written by a thirteen yearl-old girly who has no idea of actual life, real writing skills or love and relationships for that matter.The ending is good though, and really those two stars are only because this darker guy does a remarkable job to keep it out of the wastebasket. However, no matter what are you looking at, better go looking for another movie. Have you seen Shelter or Boyculture yet?"
4,Cliff Hanger,I first saw this at the San Diego Gay Film Festival and loved it so much that when it came out on DVD it was a must have for me.
3,"Interesting concept, a little light on delivery",This movie was interesting in how it trys to bring a twist to a gay theme. The story tried to weave a bit of Twighlight Zone plot into it but I felt the acting was a bit weak. The gay characters in this were uninteresting (not so much the two lead guys) and stereotypical. I do like the fact that an effort was made to be a little different with the plot so on that alone I feel this would be worth checking out but do not expect a whole lot.
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"I saw this movie last night and I was so disappointed. Crummy acting and writing and a lame story. I groaned repeatedly and was looking forward to the next feature. When I found out only this movie was being shown, I felt totally ripped off. I give this movie 2 stars because they at least tried. I cannot believe it is getting awards. Has the world gone mad?Horrible, horrible, and horrible is my description for the movie and my wasted two hours."
2,Disapointment.. So much potential,"I actually rate this movie 1 1/2 stars. I did not hate this movie, but I did not like it either. I certainly would not recommend spending any money on this movie and a part of me is embarrassed to now have this dvd in my movie collection. The storyline was so paranormally unrealistic. I wanted to believe, but I couldn't. Weak all the way around. I wanted to believe in the characters, but I did not feel a genuine love anywhere in this movie. Even though I understood the plot, nothing made sense to me.I believed in Dog Tags. It has a lower rating on amazon, but I believed in Dog Tags. I cannot say the same for this movie. I am so disappointed."
4,Capricorn Charm,Much nicer than I thought or saw in the picture. Careful wrapping and quick shipping.
3,Brake Hose - Ford Ranchero,"Looks and seems stock. Having a problem with Raybestos products regarding the threading.These, and a rear brake hose, are not threaded well in the manufacturing process. Guesswhat? They're made in China. Each time, I've had to lightly oil the threads and over-tighten them for a good seal. Luckily they did, wouldn't want to have to return them asdefective. Guess we are all stuck with them or else high prices for domestic stuff, thanksto union labor contracts..."
2,Wah wah pedal on the sound,"These are wonderful recordings. The noise reduction, though, sounds like the 1980s CEDAR system that has the effect of putting the sound through a flanger --- there is a shifting equalization contour that gets automatically set off by something in the recording. It is extremely unaesthetic tonally. No credit is given anywhere on the album of the restoration engineers or methods. I will see if I can find these recordings on Pearl or other reliable label."
4,Enemies and Friends,"om comes to Thailand and was in a rich house,bad luck happens,but he met a Thai boy called Lek.Lek sells sam-tom, (spicy food) and despises rich people. He was edcuated in a villige and learned to speak English.He had good relationship with his teacher, the teacher gave him a pocket computer when he left for Bangkok.It prooved to grant wishes, even evil ones that gets others hurt. And soon the teacher was killed by some raiding Khmer Rouge soildiers.Dom had had all the bad luck size=1><input type=hidden name=review_0001 value="
5,Very Good Book,"This was the first book that I'd read by this author. It's very good, very interesting, and factual in most ways. It tells about Thailand and the lifestyle of the people who live there among the story. The story is about a boy named Dom who moves with his parents to Thailand for a while. As soon as they arrive, bad luck descends upon him and his family. Dom befriends a Thai boy named Lek who sells som-tam (a type of spicy food) in the city. The story progresses as pieces to the puzzle of what happened to Dom's sister and her jade necklace when she'd visited before, and what Lek is so mysteriously hiding are revealed. This author's very good and if you like this book, you should try another one of his. This book is part of a sequel, and that should be read as well."
4,Michael's Review,"When Dom and his family visited Thailand, their bad luckstarted immediately. First, their car never arrived, so they had toride in a hot, smelly taxi. Then the driver couldn't find their house, so they rode around for hours trying to find it. Finally they came across a Thai boy who could tell them where their house was. Then the gate wouldn't come unlocked. But Dom went back and found the boy who directed them to their house, who agreed to help unlock the gate. The gate opened, but once inside, Dom's mom was hit by the chandelier! Can they survive this bad luck?I think the author wants us to realize that people don't need to have anything in common to be friends. Dom and Lek had just met and they became friends.I liked this book because it had realistic characters in unrealistic situations. A good bit of superstitution was thrown in, too."
3,Great Catherine,"I was unable to finish this book. I was actually looking for a biography about Catherine the Great, not a novel about Catherine the Great. I did start to read the book, and found that books need to grab me from the beginning, and this book did not. I'm sure there are people out there that would love this book as it is written by the great George Bernard Shaw. Like I stated earlier, I was actually looking for a biography regarding Catherine the Great. She was definitely a woman ahead of her time, she was not a Romanov, and became Czarina against all odds. I gave this book a 3 as I didn't dislike it, and didn't finish enough of it to give it a 4 or 5 star rating that it probably deserves!"
3,Great Catherine,"Following his eugenic convictions, the old geezer spits on whole countries and populations he knew nothing about. There are a few witty escapades, but he fills me with bitterness. Like with Caesar and Cleopatra, he is better off not digging into history, He has much better works one would prefer to read or see on stage where he works with political/social movements within his immediate surroundings.."
2,Great Catherine,"I had just received a Kindle Fire for Christmas. I was attempting to order Catherine the Great; however, this ridiculous play arrived. Now I would love to get rid of it. How do I do that?"
1,a dangerous sham,"I am a former patient of Dr. Nicolosi and have obviously read this book, which is a collection of dangerous lies. Dangerous? Says who? Try the APA, AMA and American Association of Pediatrics. Nicolosi lays out a respectable argument homosexuality can be cured, but neglects to justify WHY it should other than relying on the readers own inner homophobia. There's nothing the least bit clinical about that. This book is absolute trash and that should be kept away from the youth of America."
1,Shocking pseuo-science,"Just when you thought UFO's and ""quantum energy healing"" were as bad as it could get, books like this pop up.So-called ""reparative therapy"" is a bad joke. It belongs in the same camp as healing with crystals and the laying-on of hands. If you've got $40 to waste, by all means read it. Personally, encouraging people to accept their sense of wrongness is something that I find utterly shameful, in the same way that apartheid, Pol Pot and the Chinese ""cultural revolution"" were."
5,excellent summary of facts,"This book needs to be read slowly. It summarizesand presents a good foundation to understandthe journey out of a ""gay life."" If you are nothappy really and don't find what you seekingin gay life then understand why, you areseeking something else, deeper."
1,This book should be burned,"The people who write this sort of gay-bashing stuff under the guise of clinical therapy should lose thier credentials. This is damaging. Go buy last season's DVD of ""Queer Eye for the Straight Guy"" and tell your mom you'll be her fashion consultant forever. Don't buy this book."
1,Stay away from this book and report reparative therapists,"So-called ""reparative therapy"" is both ineffective and unethical. It doesn't work and just increases shame and guilt around same-sex attraction. I'm a therapist who has seen many clients over the years harmed by reparative therapy. If you have been to a therapist who practices reparative therapy, please report that person to the appropriate licensing board and tell the board how you've been harmed. There is nothing wrong with being gay or lesbian, bi or trans, period."
1,This is really damaging!,"This book has the potential to induce suicidal feelings in the people who read it. Telling someone that who they are is wrong/unacceptable/in need of change is damaging and irresponsible. There is nothing that needs to be ""repaired""."
1,`Gay cure' doctor admits he was wrong,"Robert Spitzer apologized to gays for a `fatally flawed' study published in 2001, which has been used by conservative groups as proof that being gay is a choiceOne of the most influential figures in modern psychiatry has apologized to the US gay community for a scientific study which supported attempts to ""cure"" people of their homosexuality.The survey, published in 2001, looked at ""reparative therapy"" and was hailed by religious and social conservatives in the US as proof that gay people could successfully become straight if they were motivated to do so.However, Robert Spitzer has now apologized in the same academic journal that published his original study, calling it ""fatally flawed.""""I believe I owe the gay community an apology,"" his letter said. ""I also apologize to any gay -person who wasted time and energy undergoing some form of reparative therapy because they believed that I had proven that reparative therapy works.""[...]"
1,What demons are this guy struggling with?,"More bad and disproved science which can lead to increased levels of anxiety, depression and suicide ideation.This guy is so fascinated with homosexuality. What is this guy afraid of in himself which he is trying to work out through this kind of dangerous writing?"
1,Please write a book for People of Color,"Thank God that this book has been intstrumental in repairing the wrong-minded homosexual. My hope is that the same material can be geared toward the Black (""African American"") Community. It's so clinically relevant considering the nature of your work that it can be used to help African Americans suffering from their struggle in their culture. It seems that and exact parallel can be drawn with regard to being black as it is to being gay. You can't choose the color of your skin (orientation) but you CAN choose not to become immersed in a culture that clearly doesn't subscribe to the same ethics and morals as the overall American Culture. This would be so helpful for many people of color who struggle because of the oppression they feel."
5,Not your mother's diet book,For a diet book this one was very friendly. It did not talk down to me or over my head with a lot of doctor mumbo jumbo but I know I'll appreciate doctor mumbo jumbo much more than I ever have before. It was a very fresh look at sticking with it which I know now how to do. And I can't wait to go on my next vacation!
4,"""Pale Fire"" and ""Lolita""","""Pnin"" isn't that great, in my opinion. On the other hand, ""Lolita"" and ""Pale Fire"" are hilarious send ups of intellectuals (which Nabokov obviously was, too). That's right: ""Lolita"" isn't mainly about pedophilia--it's about the equally perverse desire to mold youth to fit one's own wishes."
1,DO NOT BUY FOR THE FUJI X100 !!!,"i purchased this battery, thinking i was getting an oem fuji battery. The battery arrived on time, the battery, the box both say fuji, but this is not the same battery as comes with the camera. The oem battery coming with the camera has a hard shell, slides into the camera easy. this battery has a was paper type of cover, taped on the back. The batterY looks like it could fit, but is too wide. I could fit partly into the camera, but then rather than risk never getting it back out, i removed it...thats not the end, to get it out, i had to use tweezers, pull on the wax paper to pry it out, and it was not even fully in.THIS IS NOT AN OEM REPLACEMENT FOR YOUR FUJI X100, DO NOT BUY...LIKELY A BLACK MARKET BATTERY."
5,Fujifilm NP-95 Li-Ion Battery for Fuji X-100,"The best spare or replacement battery is the one made by the camera's manufacturer. Third party batteries are cheaper, but you get what you pay for and risk possible damage by inferior products.*******Revised*******This review was originally completed from the factory Fujifilm NP-95, not this listing. I don't know how my review got attached to this product, which sounds as though this is not a Fujifilm battery."
1,DELUSIONE,"Ho acquistato e pagato il prodotti il 13 agosto, (NP-95) dopo 90 giorni non ho ancora ricevuto il prodotto e neanche la restituzione di 35,36 USD. Quanto devo aspettare per avere la mia batteria o i miei soldi."
1,Not an original OEM np-95 battery,"I ordered this item specifically from Amazon thinking I would get an original OEM np-95 battery. This is not the case.1) The battery I received does not fit in as smoothly as the original, and has a loose plastic label taped on the body of the battery.2) The original np-95 battery has a label in English. The one I received has a label in Japanese.3) Search for np-95 on eBay. You will find that they sell those np-95 batteries with Japanese labels for less than $10 shipping from Hong Kong.CLEARLY NOT AN ORIGINAL OEM NP-95 BATTERY!!!"
3,Good Rocking Album,After listening to Dont cry wolf I decided to give this album a shot because of some good music on that album and also for all the big names in the band. As for this one I think they showed they have potential to make it big but unfortuntely the band meant to live short and broke up before they could make it to the next level.
5,Fascinating Read,"I needed this book for one of my classes. It is the only case study collection that I've read, so I can't compare it to others. But it was organized in an easy to follow manner with summaries at the beginning of each case. Then each case was divided into several sections like patient history, triggering event, treatment, et cetera. It was interestingly enough written that I read many cases which were not required for my class."
1,Rodentz Suckz,"One of the worst movies ever. Talk about bad computer generated effects. This movie has the worst. The effects are cartoonish at best.The only thing worse than the computer generated effects are the ones done the good old fashioned way which appear to be close-ups of somebody's house slippers.There are several other movies like this available that are much better films, ""The Rats"" for instance.I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."
3,amusing and not that bad,"I love cheesy corny horror movies and this was both. From the 30 something year old actresses that were supposed to be college age to the giant fake rat clinging to the top of a moving vehicle, I enjoyed it in all of it's stupid splendor. I thought it was very funny."
1,Rodentz suckz...........,Worst movie ever. Talk about bad computer generated effects. This is the worst I've ever seen. Cartoonish at best.The only thing worse than the computer generated effects were the effects done the good old fashioned way. They looked like close ups of somebody's furry house slippers.Why do people even make movies like this?Don't movie makers take pride in their work anymore?If you want to see a decent movie about killer rodents then see the movie 'Rats'.It is a much better quality movie with some unique ideas.Rodentz should be exterminated.
1,WHAT CAN ONE REALLY SAY?,"RODENTZ is almost so bad that its good. Especially the hilarious giant rat that looks like someone running around in a rat suit. Guy Vieg, who plays the professor, looks like he needs a good hit of Pepto Bismol; Aaron Haff, who tries to generate some life into Walter, merely looks dazed and confused. The rest of the cast, oh boy....where did they find them? And notice that in the outdoor scenes, there are no other people or cars around. The director also likes to segue into action scenes by showing the same silhouetted moon and cars going 160 miles on the freeway. A lame excuse for a horror movie that doesn't quite make cult cheez status."
3,a collection of light and humorous poems,"This is a collection of light and humorous poems with a rhythmic and rhyming structure. Many are illustrated with simple pen and ink drawings. Some of the poems take a stand against war, but most are fairly whimsical.One of my favorites is about a romantic meeting between Snowman Frost and Lady Thaw. Here are a couple of lines:""As their passions rose in a heat,off he melted from the seat.""now""Snowman Frost no more will hug,she must keep him in a mug."""
2,Rehash of 25 yr old Decca recordings. New CDs much better.,"Universal keeps releasing these 25 year old Decca analogue recordings despite the fact that The Rovers are still a very active touring and recording group. In fact, they have three new albums in the last three years. One is an excellent completely re-recorded 2 CD set of 32 of their best songs entitled GEMS. This is a beautiful set and a great gift. Best to buy the new product."
4,Excellent work from the master,"Even today, it's well worth getting this book. The best part is his utter dismantling of Summer of 1949, David Halberstam's bestseller. James points out at least 7 separate foolish statements or flat-out untruths halberstam makes. James also reviews all the players in the league and makes his normal excellent analysis. He has a great essay on the failures of psychology in the Gary Sheffield analysis. Definitely a classic."
1,Save your money and download the Congressional Report,"I would say rather than spend your money on this book, download the Congressional Report. You get all the same information. I felt like the author spent too much time congratulating herself and patting herself on the back."
1,doubtful,"after hearing this woman interviewed several times following the publication of her recent book on area 51, i have concluded that she is something of a lunatic. this book on airline security seems absurd to me and a clear reaction to a paranoid moment that she was probably ashamed of. how does somebody with this kind of mind garner so much attention when she writes books that really should be relegated to the pulp fiction aisle. don't get me wrong, i have no problem with pulp fiction. but why try to pass it off as factual? unless, of course, she has some kind of mental thing going on that compels her to do things like this."
4,Breaking new boundries,"This CD is deffinantly for the open minded hip hop fan. It has very unique beats. Its got MF DOOM on it! The best song is the ""once in your life"" re make - very intense and passionate.Well worth the money."
3,Sandoz knows her subject well,"Mari Sandoz, the daughter of German-Swiss parents, was born in 1896 on the Great Plains of Nebraska, and spent much of her young life amid the Sioux tribes there at that time. This book, which is only 118 pages long, briefly depicts much of what she learned first-hand of Sioux customs and rituals. She writes with great intimacy, love, and a depth of knowledge that few could match. Her prose sometimes meanders, and often gives the sense of being unstructured, without a coherent thread. This might bother some and not others. Admittedly, it bothered me at times, as I prefer my facts and history presented in a more cohesive context. That said, I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone interested in Native American history."
3,"""Brother Rat"" - Life at the Institute","As an alumnus of the Virginia Military Institute , I enjoyed watching this film. It takes a look inside the life of a cadet and the obstacles he must overcome with the help of his closest friends - BROTHER RATS. Although the film takes place in the 1930's, so much seems to have remained the same and endured the test of time. The Barracks termanology, open wall lockers that are all inspectoin ready, mattresses rolled and stacked to make room for the cadets in their rooms to study and move about. The only real changes in Barracks since 1839 can be the addition of running water and electricity!My spouse also enjoyed watching the film - once she was able to keep me quiet with all of my input and ""inside knowledge""! I would recommend it to anyone because with a good basic storyline and a happy ending, what's not t oenjoy!"
3,Fourth banana.,"The further he recedes into history, the more I seem to appreciate Ronald Reagan. As an actor. He was really pretty good. He put it to good use in politics I might add. An early effort when he was a contract player was Brother Rat. He co-stars behind his fellow VMI cadets, played by Eddie Albert & Wayne Morris. They're ready to graduate if they can stay out of trouble & away from the girls. Unlikely. They are played by Priscilla Davis (the star) Jane Bryant (the pregnant one) & Jane Wyman (Ronnie's girl). They are uniformly cute, perky & smart but incredibly naive. This is 1938 after all. High energy comedy. This is where Reagan met his first wife, Ms Wyman. They became a couple. What publicity. In fact by the time the sequel came along, Brother Rat & a Kid, they were either engaged or married. Lots of clean hi-jinks as they use to say. A fun movie."
4,Fun old movie,We enjoyed this although it is not a fine film. With VMI so close by it was fun to hear area places mentioned.
5,Brother Rat,Excellent quality; delivered promptly. Enjoyed by two families and will be for years. This was purchased by the grandparents of a VMI RAT.
2,WHY?????????????,"Was this movie really necessary? The first one was passable fluff made watchable mainly by Michael Caine, but this one has no Michael Caine and really no direction in which to go. An unmemorable waste of time, and an unneeded and unwanted sequel to a lukewarm movie. Sandra Bullock needs to pick better scripts or else she'll be doomed to Miss Congeniality 3 and Murder by Numbers 2. Let's pray that doesn't happen. Please pray hard."
4,Miss Congeniality 2 is great!,"I went and saw this movie with very high hopes and it didnt let me down. The movie is really good. Dont pay attention to these ""professional"" reviewers because they grade it on how artsy and all that crap that it is. These reviewers gave the 1st movie bad reviews and its a classic. This movie is hillarious and lives up to the original. If you liked the original I reccomend this or if you didnt like the first one because of the beauty pageant stuff then you'll love this one."
4,This Movie Was Better Than It Was Rated!!!!!!!!!!,"My local newspaper stated that the sequel to the hit move, ""Miss Congeniality"", was a waste of time, money, and Sandra Bullock's talent. I thought the exact opposite.Even my mom thought the movie was good, and she usually follows what critics say!I would like to say to everyone who is unsure about seeing this movie should at least check it ount: I guaruntee you won't think of it as critics do!!--By Sarah L.Age 11 1/2"
1,Lowered Herself!!!!,"I have watched both 1&2 of Miss Congeniality. Movie 1 was fair movie 2 just has to be the worst movie I have watched since Kill Bill!! You could tell what the story was leading up to,far ahead of the scene. Sandra Bullock had better stay away from these loser productions or her career will go downhill fast.The supporting cast did not help this film (old man from startrek) Regis!! Get a story and some real supporting actors next time Miss Bullock!!"
2,The story is there... but the characters aren't!,"This next installment of Miss Congeniality had a good story, but, in order to make that story, they ruined one of the main characters from the previous movie! Eric Matthews, Gracie's co-worker and love interest in the last movie, is not in this movie physically, but his name is tossed and bashed throughout the entire movie. The biggest mistake they made in this movie was that they made Eric seem like some really BAD guy, and he just wasn't. In the last movie, he was a really NICE guy. You just can't make someone be bad so you can make a story for a sequel. Other than that HUGE screw-up, the movie is pretty good."
2,miss congeniality 2,my family and i did not like as well as the first one.it was funny but not as funny as the first one.it was okay.
3,Doesn't even Compare to the first film but still a pretty funny movie!,"I really loved the first movie, but this sequel wasn't nearly as great as the first. However, Bullock played a great part and gave it what it needed. Too bad the plot wasn't a little better than it was. I would definitely see it again and again, but the first one will always be my all time favorite compared to the first movie."
2,Miss Congeniality 2 - Armed and Fabulous,"I'm a big fan of Sandra Bullock. Always enjoy most of her movies, but this one has a very ""silly"" plot line. This is not a good sequel. The first one was much better, much funnier, and a had a much better cast."
1,"No, no no!!",I was in Mexico and it was either see this in theaters or see a movie in Spanish. I should have seen a movie in Spanish.
5,Fabulouso,"The only disappointment was that Benjamin Bratt was not in the sequal. He is such a cutie, but the film itself did not disappoint. It was cute, funny and I cried a little too. LOVED IT!! Regina adds an interesting part to it as well."
4,Better than the first,"This sequel is just pure fun. Nothing more, nothing less. Bullock is great as Gracie and the supporting cast is filled with big names. I thought it'd be a silly movie, but it's really enjoyable and very entertaining."
4,surprisingly good,"I can't believe Sandra Bullock was the main star in a movie I consider good (usually she annoys me the way she tends to mumble nonsense on and on and on) but her role in Miss Congeniality 2 was quite funny, and actually had a bit of seriousness implemented in the storyline. I especially liked that one female cop who took absolutely NO crap from anyone, including Sandra's character. Sandra and this cop had to work together as part of a team. Overall, a fair amount of humor and a surprising amount of action makes Miss Congeniality 2 really good."
4,Cute sequel,"Sandra Bullock's character, Gracie Hart was an undercover beauty pageant contestant in Mis Congeniality and now, this FBI agent is such a celebrity that she can no longer operate sucessfully. Accordingly, she is given a new role, that of public relations for the agency. She lost the ability to operate as an agent and she lost her boyfriend who dumped her. Along with a bodyguard who has an attitude and is hard to get along with, Gracie goes on tour promoting her book and the FBI. Meanwhile, her good friend, Miss USA gets kidnapped along with an official from the pageant (played by William Shatner).If you have seen Leslie Nielsen in the Naked Gun series of movies, you know the formula. You may rememeber that in one of the movies, he was forbidden to get involved in an investigation, does so anyway, and solves the crime. Well, the same formula plays out here. As soon as Gracie is told not to get involved, you know what will happen. Still, this is good comedic fun and I recommend this DVD."
3,Better Than I Thought,"I really wanted to dislike this movie because Miss Congeniality is just one of those films that did not require a sequel. In making one, all the studio is doing is trying to milk a few more dollars out of a previously good movie. That being said, it was actually much better than I thought it would be. While it certainly wasn't as good as Miss Congeniality, it had several funny moments and the interaction between Sandra Bullock and Regina King was great. At times, they were like a modern day Lucy and Ethel. Sadly, there just weren't enough of those moments. The plot was thin and the script seemed to be written by an elementary student. It's really Bullock and King who make the film watchable. This is just one of those films you don't want to pay to see in the theatre, but it's good enough to spend a few dollars to rent."
2,"Too, too ""cute"" -- not good, ""cute""","I enjoy the actors in this movie -- love Sandra Bullock, in other shows including Congeniality 1. However, this is simply cute actions, cute comments, cute situations. Little plot, nothing new or unexpected. Just ""cute."" No where near as good as #1 although the supporting actress is very good. Runs a close tie with Oceans 12 for second attempts. If you enjoy watching them having fun and being ""cute"", you'll enjoy this movie; otherwise wait and rent the video."
2,"I guess they ""Showed Sandra The Money""!","This is what happens when you show a cute aging actress the promise of a fat check to duplicate a previous box office hit. You get this insipid followup to Miss Congeniality. I'll just cut to the chase. This is a lousy movie. Sorry Sandra, girl of my dreams, everybody's favorite all american girl but the next time they ""Show You The Money"" my advice is show them the door! These types of failures can ruin even a seemingly unstoppable career like yours. They wasted you and every other talented cast member of this movie by giving you a script that looks like it was hand written as you went along, directed using all 1st takes, and was shot in a weekend. Garbage!"
2,Script went in the wrong direction,"The first Miss Congeniality, while not a comedic masterpiece, was better and funnier than I thought it would be. The second one is about what I expected out of an unnecessary sequel. There are some funny scenes, especially by William Shatner returning as the pageant director, but not enough of them. And I thought for too much of the movie they lost who Gracie Hart was.She has become so famous that she can't do field work so they make her the 'face' of the FBI and she's given a staff of stylists and sent out to do publicity for the bureau. Wanting to do anything she can for her belovd FBI, Gracie dives in and loses herself. She becomes arrogant and irritating. This isn't the person everyone was rooting for in the first movie. She finds herself late and the ending is a lot of fun but by then its too little too late."
4,Just plain funny,"This movie is very funny. The overall wit and writing was very well thought out and Sandra Bullock and her cohorts played their parts wonderfully. Nearly every 30 seconds their is something funny said or done. The plot is somewhat convoluted, though, thus if you are looking for a serious movie that makes sense, don't go to this movie. If however, you are looking for a funny and entertaining film to help you relax and laugh along with, then this is the movie for you. I am still laughing at some of the lines in this movie."
3,armed and women in black,"Sandra Bullock does a good job of being a down and outFBI agent who becomes a TV shill for the FBI.With a ghosted book, a personal trainer, a make up teamand a body guardshe goes to Los Vegas when her friend Miss Americais kidnapped. How she solves the mystery of the crimewhile being thwarted by the agent in chargeand becomes friends and partner with an anger managementblack women FBI agent is the plot of the movie.The movie is actually pretty funny as Hollywood comedyin the Ben Stiller era goes! Not loss of taste takes placeeven in a cross dressing night club!I enjoyed the result, but wouldn't play the movies again."
2,Disappointing sequel that does not live up to the original,"Miss Congeniality 2 is billed as a comedy, but I doubt if I laughed more than two or three time through the whole movie. The screen play is weak and the characters are either flat and boring or depressing. On a relative scale if we rate the original Miss Congeniality as a ten then the sequel doesn't deserve better than a four.The class that Michael Caine brought to the original is completely missing in the sequel. Neither Enrique Murciano or William Shatner come close to Michael Caine.The box office results are also revealing. The original made well over two hundred million worldwide, but the sequel barely broke one hundred million worldwide.In conclusion a dull and lifeless movie. Unless you are a diehard Sandra Bullock fan or simply must see every sequel skip this movie and save your money."
3,"TIRED AND UNINSPIRED, BUT STILL OKAY","The need for a sequel to Sandra Bullock's first MISS CONGENIALITY seems uninspired and tired, but even so, it manages a few chuckles and for fluff entertainment, fills the bill. Sandra is back this time as ""the face for the FBI,"" which means she's in a promotional role trying to improve the image of the FBI. Her boyfriend is gone this time and she's paired with a snippety, bitter agent (Regina King). Her friend, Miss USA (Heather Burns) is kidnapped, along with the pageant's master of ceremonies (William Shatner), so Bullock dives in head first, ticking off the agent in charge (Treat Williams), and winning the friendship of a naive young agent (Enrique Murciano). Bullock and King battle, banter and then bond; King gets to do a Tina Turner imitation and all ends happily as expected. Diedrich Bader as the flaming make up consultant is cliche, but he's so good you forgive the writers. All in all, divertive entertainment, but shouldn't inspire a third in the series."
3,Not As Good As The First...,"The first Miss Congeniality was great, I loved it. Yet this one does not exactly add up. It was funny, I did like it, yet if I had to choose one and only one MC1 would be it because it is a lot more funnier and more better in plot. The plot really isn't that strong in MC2 and the actors were all right but not as bright as they were on MC1. I guess what I am saying is that MC1 is stronger and more memorable than MC2. Most of the time sequels are not as strong as the first so it was no surprise to me. I was hoping the sequel was not terrible though and I am glad to see it was pretty good. I think though I'll stick with MC1 out of the two though, it's the better out of the two. Yet both of the films have a great theme to it, and I love how they empowered that theme at the end of this film."
2,Below Average,Miss Congeniality 2- Armed and Fabulous is a below average movie. There was no point to it. Just another sequel to a great movie. The first one made since. I didn't understand anything that was going on. It would be more of a rental than a buy. It be a great movie if you become really bored during the summer and you needed something to do.
1,Tasted like rot,I waited a week to open the bag because the meat inside looked dubious. When I did open it I got a very strong smell of spoil and the tubes themselves were very greasy. I got sick to my stomach after eating no more than two bites of one of the tubes. The taste was strongly chemical and of rot.
3,It's OK,"As others have noted, this jerky is chopped and formed. It also is too greasy for my taste, but for those who like a rich jerky, it may be just what you are looking for."
2,venison jerky?,i wouldnt call it venison jerky i would call it meat flavored rubber strips. not very good but i do like the other jerky products from them
2,ordinary scissors,I bought these scissors and paid ten bucks for an ordinary pair of scissors. Do yourself a favor go find some scissors for 4 or 5 bucks and save yourself the money.
4,This record is a brilliant release.,"Betty Carter gave us something pretty special with this mellow, deeply musical album. If you are a jazz collecter, this is going to be something you want to hear. The title track is one of the loveliest, bluest melodies I've ever heard. There are no lyrics until the final minute of the song (it's all Betty's slow scat, tenor saxophone, killer base, drums, and piano) and when she finally lays the words on you, they're so poignant: ""We haven't met since then. Gee, but it's nice to see you again."" I mean, it all comes together right at that moment. It'd be nice to see a singer like Betty Carter again."
4,HOME SWEET HOME,Good story of a boy who adopts a salmon. Read about the life cycle of this fish. The Ranger tags the fish. Does he come home ? Read it and find out ! Good Fishing for this out of print book .Worth your time to look for.
4,great for beginning readers,"Too bad this one is out of print - if you can find it used, it would be a great find.I like it because it not only is phonetically easy reading, but it's about the life cycle and migration of salmon. A nice change from the beginning readers about nothing at all.The illustrations aren't in lots of colors - that's the only drawback to this story.My kids like this book, and it was my little sister's favorite book when she was a child. (Which was why my mom still had it, years after it was out of print.)"
5,A CLASSIC,A classic non-fiction early reader. The I CAN READ SERIES also features Lobel's Frog and Toad. They don't make 'em better than this.
2,Did not turn out Quite Like the Author Thought,This is a good book to get some review of events that have happened in Colombia. The author though writes with a clear bias and criticism of the path to a better Colombia. Almost 10 years later I think his perspective has turned out not to have been accurate.
5,WOW,"this movie is, in a word, stunning. the acting is a tour de force not seen out of japan in at least 20 years. ryo feels so real it's like you can literally feel him. feel his delicious luciferian ""assets."" akira is realistic as a the dumb piece of s--- he normally is in the manga, so kudos for that. however the main attraction in terms of acting for this movie is bill jackson, aka lord zenon. he brings so much depth and subtle emotion to the plot that it's impossible to not tear up a little as he reveals his true allegiance. there are also cool females but i don't remember them as much but who cares. they're cool. the plot is also completely shocking, you will laugh, cry, and never be able to see what's coming next despite the film excerpt above literally spoiling all of the main components of the story. the cg is so life like and realistic, you might be tricked into thinking it's actually happening! this is seriously the best movie ever. i give devilman the live action 5 psycho jennys out of 5"
3,not bad at all,this is a nice movie if you are a devilman fan this good movie . not bad for the price the picture qulity is good storie line is good a little cgi if no what I mean .
5,the rock and roll we have been missing,It is so refreshing to hear a band play rock and roll. these guys sound great on cd and even better live. this cd is totally worth checking out.
5,Built to Last with a Lifetime Warranty + Great Swivel Head!,"~My pair of Fiskars grass shears blade broke after 3 months just cutting grass. I got these based on the reviews to replace the Fiskars.Gardena made a precision quality shear that is very comfortable to use, and the cutting head swivels with several stop so you get the trim you really like.I doubt that I will have to take them up on their lifetime warranty, and I will be looking for more Gardena products."
3,don't work well for very thick lawn trimming,"These shears look nice and are quite comfortable to use. If you are trying to edge the lawn which has grown for a few months though you may have a bit of trouble. It just doesn't want to cut throught too much grass. If the clipping needs are light duty though, it does work well. The adjustable cutting head is a nice feature too."
4,Lovely!,"I love these glasses! They are beautiful, sturdy, and the quality is excellent. Considering how gorgeous they are, the price is amazing. I'll probably order more. I wish they were a little larger, but it's not a big deal."
4,"Arrived as expected, visually beautiful glasses",The glasses are very solid and I expect them to last for years. No problem with shipment. For under $20 a great deal.
5,G O R G E O U S GLASSWARE!,"These beautiful, artisan-like glasses will not dissappoint. They are substantial in quality, a bit unusual with distinct color and irregular hand-crafted design. Wonderfully affordable. Be sure to purchase this size and not the 9 oz. I have both and these offer that little extra room that the smaller size does not. Great for citrus martinis as the citrus pulp from lime or lemon does not show through the glass.Top-notch :)"
5,bormioli glasses,i love them. they are nice to hold and beautiful to look at. i only wish they were taller
1,way too expensive,"these glasses are beautiful! but i must tell you something which will make you sad... my daughter just bought 20 of these glasses @ the christmas tree shop for $1.69/glass.... the same glasses, stamped on the bottom with ""Bormioli Rocco""... what a bargain!"
5,These glasses are fantastic,I bought these glasses 2 or 3 years ago and not one has broken or chipped. This is the first time I have had a set of glasses this long. We have 5 people in our family and in our home at any given time using these glasses.
4,Lovely glassware but holds 12 ounces not over 14.,I love the look and weight of this glassware. I agree with the reviewer stating this does not hold 14 7/8 ounces. I measured and it holds at the most 12 ounces (filled at the brim). I will keep and may get more but would prefer one that holds 14 ounces or more.
5,Beautiful Splash of Color,"These glasses are beautiful! The splash of color through the clear glass sets off my blue plates quite nicely. They are heavy and feel good to hold. One word of caution: if you break one, it shatters into pebbles of what resembles safety glass, no sharp edges but a mess to collect from all over the floor and counter. Worth the risk because they are so lovely - just don't drop one!"
5,Great Quality,For the price you can't go wrong. The glasses are just as sharp as they appear in the pictures. They have an expensive feel and look without the price tag.
4,Absolutely beautiful!,"I just got these glasses today and they are so gorgeous. I am so glad I ordered two sets.The reason for only giving 4 stars? Filled to the brim these glasses only hold exactly 12oz, so it'll hold about 10oz realistically for drinking purposes. That is just a minor flaw, but I would think that a company should be able to acurately measure the amount of liquid their glass can hold. Even if I had known about that I would have still bought the glasses, as they are absolutely beautiful."
3,"Ordered 3 sets, 1 set defective","I ordered three sets of these glasses thinking they'd make good margarita glasses (I don't like stemmed margarita glasses) though with some concern as to whether they'd be large enough, especially given some comments here that they were smaller than advertised. I do believe they will sufficiently function to my purpose however unfortunately 1 set had a chip on the rim of each glass, which I have to assume was an overlooked quality control problem. Also one glass in another set was somewhat warped and should not have been passed on to the consumer. It's functional and I guess I will keep it, but I am not totally pleased with the item. As for the other glasses they looked fine and I hope to enjoy them. Though I am returning one set for replacement."
2,Disappointed in size!,"These These glasses do not hold 14 7/8oz. They hold 12oz. I am very disappointed! They are very sturdy, however I was looking for more volume."
3,Doesn't live up to all the 5-star reviews,"First, one of the 4 glasses I got had about a 2-inch crack in it. They were packed well enough, each glass individually bubble-wrapped, and no signs of shipping stress. I think they just came from the factory like this. One other glass had several small air bubbles in it. Not good quality control.Even had the glasses been perfect, I still would only rate them 3-stars. Maybe 3.5, if that were an option. For the rave reviews on here, I was expecting better."
2,Caution--not really as great as 5 star reviews say,"These glasses try to be artistic and funky, and from all the 5 star reviews that's what you'd expect. I bought them and was really disappointed. They are just plain ugly."
5,LOVE!,"I am so happy I bought these. They were on my wish list for a year and I finally decided to get them, even though they don't match my other kitchen decor. They're gorgeous and much bigger than I expected. I, thrilled with this purchase!"
4,Super for Salmon,"This plank is great if you live in the Northwest and can get fresh Salmon--it comes out tasting very sweet and tender. The plank is very sturdy, but not too heavy to use, and I've also used it to cook other foods. But it's best with Salmon, take my word for it. Don't let the so-so art on it throw you off, this cooking plank is excellent."
5,"Yeah, Ella was the best, but this was a masterpiece","Ella was trying to be contemporary at the time, and fortunately it was a grear step that has aged well over the years.I know some feel it's blasphemy to give her anything less than six stars -- but I read even she thought this was a masterpiece."
4,Ella Mixes It Up,"It's not one of the first twenty Ella F. LPs to buy, but she sincerely sings and swings the rock anthems that probably drove her older fans mad; and also does well by the Ellington and standards too. She didn't have to record anything she didn't like and it's obvious from this she didn't. Most of the LPs from this period by older artists doing any rock song were ridiculous and camp now. This is real. Did any pop singer ever have a range this large? Had she been born forty years later she'd have been the black Janus Joplin."
5,Love it,"This book is wonderful! I am giving it to my grown son who recently moved away after graduating from college and getting a new job. And one for my best friend, who is soon to be going through the same.Wonder illustrations and story!"
2,translation,"This book isn't written very coherently, but I suspect that much of that can be ascribed to the translation. Decent narrative but I have read many more better ones."
3,Honesty and Objectivity Trump Literary Value,"If the reader approaches this memoir as literature, he'll learn quickly enough that Red Road from Stalingrad is no War and Peace - hence my three-star rating.BUT - if the reader is interested in real history, in raw ""data"", in developing a feel for what it took to beat into pulp the greatest Army the world has ever seen, this book and its ilk are invaluable resources: the simple records of simple men."
4,Great Christian reference for homeschoolers,This book is aweseom for giving you a method to put Christ first in your child's education. It give you the tools to do it yourself and show you resources to assist you. Have a highlighter handy becuase you're going to want to look back at most if it from time to time!
4,A good resource,"There are other checklists available for those homeschooling parents who want to know what they might need to teach their children. You can even find some of these checklists on line. The ""what your child needs to know in.."" series will also help.What sets this one aside is it also covers character education and has check lists for what you might need to teach your child at different ages in character education and Biblical education.One of the things that I liked is that there was a place to write each child's name and youc an easily track what your children know at each level up to three children. Another thing I liked was that the checklists seperated out by grade were also seperated out by Character/Biblical Principals vs. State expected checklists. This made it easy to concentrate on just one thing if you wanted to do so.The only complaint I had was that it stopped at 8th grade. I would like to see another book along these same lines with 8-12th grade.Enjoy."
4,"Excellent follow-up to ""World Without Rules""","For three years I have been wondering how Haslinger would follow-up on his ground-breaking ""World Without Rules"". This time around he takes us in a different direction. Darker, and with more of an an emphasis on street/rap/hip-hop beats, Paul continues to prove his mastery of the studio as an instrument. Nothing in modern music today compares to Haslinger's unique sound sculpting abilities. While not as stylistically varied as his previous work, it continues to break new sonic ground. This, too, will occupy much time in my home and car cd."
2,Poor Quality,"I have used Gardenia products for years without a problem until my purchase of a Gardenia Flower Shower Nozzle. The cap keeps coming off with the slightest water pressure and it leaks.I bought three nozzles at the same time and I have the same problem with each. The plastic threads are not adequate. Poor engineering or poor quality, but I expect Gardenia has written all the reviews you see on this site."
5,BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!!!,This is the greatest!!! I was so in awe by the raw delivery on EACH song!!! There is no comparison. I listen to this cd just about every day. I cannot get enough of it. Her tone on these songs makes the listener feel as though they are in the Tivoli. She paints colors. It is incredibly hard to pin point a favorite song. You must buy this whether or not you are a Sarah fan or just a music lover it is a must have. Anything you ever wanted to learn about music is here!!!! Simply Beautiful!!
1,Utterly worthless,You camera will record audio better WITHOUT this microphone. Luckily I bought it locally and will be returning it.
1,It's really a piece of garbage...,"Got it for my 5D MKII. Made several tests and in all cases, the result WITHOUT the Sima microphone was better, confirming all other reviews. It's a true piece of garbage. This company should be ashamed selling this kind of thing! DO NOT BUY IT."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"I bought this to improve the sound on Canon Elura 100; even though the camcorder has pretty poor sound qaulity, but it was still FAR better without this MZM-1 microphone. The MZM-1 sound quality has heavy static, and we could not tell the difference between ""normal"" and ""zoom""."
1,Worse Microphone Ever Invented!,"SIMA should be sued for misleading advertising, the box reads: ""Eliminates Background Noise"" and ""Sturdy"" but such claims are absolute rubbish! It does not eliminate background noise, it actually introduces interference into your soundtrack and if you by any chance switch it to ""zoom mode"" you are going to hear nothing but noise. The mike picks up sound from the front as well as the back, it is not directional by any stretch of the imagination, all claims by the manufacturer are absolute lies.It is not sturdy either, it is made out of cheap plastic and so is the hot-shoe that attaches to the camera. In fact, it is so fragile, I almost broke it taking it out of the package. If you had a bad experience with this mike, return it and write a review here, perhaps eventually they will stop making this piece of junk. Avoid it at all cost."
1,Unethical!,"It's unethical to sell such a mediocre product and make such false promises. The sound quality is simply awful, significantly worse than the camera's original microphone. And switching from ""normal"" to ""zoom"" has no real effect: it is bad, and it remains bad.I flew from California to Switzerland to conduct 10 video interviews of very interesting (and busy!) people. The first eight, taped with the Sima MZM1 microphone, are basically useless. The last two are decent, only because I realized that this device was ruining my project and I stopped using it.What a shame to market such an awful product!"
4,Audiovox IR headphones IRHSCS work with Chrysler system,"These wireless headphones are infrared and are compatible with the factory DVD system in my Chrysler Town & Country.They sound good enough, are comfortable enough and cheap enough.They appear to be made by the same manufacturer that makes the Chrysler factory stuff, only with different printing and vinyl covered ear pads instead of the cloth covered ones on the Chrysler 'phones. They also have a snap off battery cover instead of a screw held one.NOW, if I could just find a set of replacement ear pads for these..."
4,Laminating Sheets are So Useful!,"So far, I have found many uses for these laminating sheets! Cards, Placards and Recipes are only the beginning! Also, the price is just right!"
2,Too Flimsy,"I bought this for my children's gerbils because the first cage I purchased (a ""cheaper"" brand) broke within a week. This one made it three months. The gerbils love it, but they ignore their wood chew sticks and have chewed on the slide so badly that it completely detached from the wheel tunnel. The tubes do not attach tightly, which led to the gerbils getting out one night and it took two days to catch them again. The clips that hold the cage together do not snap tightly. No sooner had we caught our gerbils and put them back in their cage then my son picked up the cage and it came apart and the gerbils escaped again. I will not buy a CritterTrails product again."
2,not the best mouse cage,I GOT THIS CAGE FOR OUR TWO MICE. THE WHEEL ON TOP LOOKS REAL FUN. BUT IT IS REALLY NOT SANITARY. MOUSE POOP ENDED UP ALL AROUND THE WHEEL AND ON THE FLOOR AROUND THE CAGE. WE HAVE TWO OTHER CRITTER TRAIL CAGES AND WE LOVE THEM ESPECIALY THE TWO LEVEL CAGE. I AM GOING TO GET A SMALL WHEEL FOR INSIDE THE CAGE AND A LOOK OUT ADDITION TO REPLACE THE WHEEL ON TOP AND MAYBE THEN WE CAN USE THIS CAGE B/C THE MICE LIKE THE SLIDE. WE SWITCH OUT THEIR CAGE ABOUT ONCE A MONTH TO KEEP THE MICE MORE ENTERTAINED. WE COULD NEVER GET THE SLIDE TO ATTACH TO THE TOP OF THE CAGE RIGHT EITHER SO WE JUST STUCK IT IN THE BEST THAT WE COULD. IF ANYONE KNOWS A TRICK TO ATTACHING THAT SLIDE PLEASE LET ME KNOW. IF THE COMPANY WOULD COME UP WITH A BETTER WAY TO MAKE THAT WHEEL WHERE POOP WOULD NOT FLY OUT THIS PRODUCT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER. OH I ALMOST FORGOT WE ENDED UP HAVING TO DUCK TAPE THE WHEEL TO THE CAGE B/C IT KEPT COMING OFF AND THE MICE ALMOST GOT OUT ONCE.
1,Messy,"Although this cage looks cool, I would caution against it or any other cage that has a wheel on the outside. my dwarf hamster ran in it like crazy, which was good. But he sprayed poop and urine all over the desk the cage was on, which was bad. Get a cage or aquarium inside of which you can put the wheel."
3,"Love the Cage, not the Slide","I bought this for my 9 year old son to keep his mice in it. We love the appearance of the cage, all the bright colors and the little window box at the top.The problems started, however, when we were putting the cage together. For the life of me, I just could not make the slide fit. I truly don't think it was made properly. Finally, one of the tabs that fixes the slide to the top of the cage just broke off. So our cage does not have a slide or are we able to use the wheel.We use it anyway, the mice are happy, everyone happy, but we could not use the wheel."
3,There are better options out there!,"This is too small for a syrian or teddy bear hamster! It is OK for 1 dwarf but there are better options out there!First off, this is a pain to clean because the top section is really hard to release to remove so you can dump the shavings. The wheel is a clever idea but my hamster would haul bedding up there and use it as a nest and then pieces would fall out the air holes-big mess.Yes, you can add lots of tunnels to this but the tunnels can be a pain to clean if they pee in them a lot-which mine did.Save your money and use a 20 gal long reptile tank. They are easier to clean and a lot more room for your hamster."
1,Flimsy parts,"I have had this cage for a year. The plastic parts are very flimsy and easily break. The petting compartment latch broke after only a month and I had to tape it closed. The wheel quit working well after a few months and the part the wheel sets down into broke, so it is not secure. The cage is very difficult to clean as it falls apart every time I try to lift the top section off to clean the bottom part. What others say about the wheel is true as well. My hamster uses it for a bed and other things then tries to run in the wheel and the stuff goes everywhere. I am purchasing a different cage as this one is falling apart after only having it a year."
2,It's all well and good until it breaks.,"My son's hamster is Now safe and sound in a DIFFERENT cage because the tiny little plastic pieces that held the wheel in place broke, after only 6 months of owning this cage, and the hamster escaped and was missing for 3 days. It was difficult to clean the wheel, and the wheel was very noisy. But the hamster did love the little viewing spot at the top of the cage. That was where he made his bedding area. I wouldn't recommend the cage based on the fact that the slide and wheel design is not solid enough, but the concept of the cage is fun and exciting so no one is more disappointed that the cage didn't work out than I am."
3,not for big hamsters,"this cage is kinda small for a big hamsters, the cage is small for putting the bowl and a litter box in,and the wheel omg it is so loud we have to put in another room at night.white power comes off the thing cause she goes so fast shes running down the plastic........"
1,Don't buy it!!,"It's a big mess, very hard to clean. But my daughter loves it!! Perhaps that's because she doesn't have to clean it!"
2,disappointed,"super cute looking home, but the wheel design is poor because the slits in where it connects allow poop and bedding (which our hamster takes up there) to come out all over the top of the cage and onto the surface below...yuck!"
3,"good, but not chew proof","I really enjoy this cage, the loft is great, and you can add on to it. But my two gerbils Itchy and Scratchy love chewing on the slide. They chewed it so much it could no longer stay in so i took out and took out the wheel and the slide. Also their ""waste"" falls out of the wheel but there's a tray to catch it. And last there bedding falls out a lot but otherwise i like it."
2,Poo flinger,"We've had this habitat for about a week and a half. It looks really cool and fun, but the hamster immediately started nesting in the wheel, which means when he runs, he flings poo everywhere. It's very unsanitary. I just purchased the expansion lookout to replace the current wheel and a new wheel that will fit inside the cage. If I were doing this over, I would buy the Super Pet CritterTrail Primary Habitat available on Amazon for about $23. As it stands now, I've invested nearly $60 in the Super Pet CritterTrail Extreme Challenge Habitat, the expansion lookout and new wheel {the hamster, Roscoe (a.k.a. Agent R) has to exercise}."
3,Wheel Woes,"My daughter bought this for her hamster. The animal seems to love it, although she did take some time getting used to the wheel. Which brings me to the ""woes"". Once she started using it she used it for more than exercise, if you get my drift. Thankfully the tray underneath catches everything. However, when it comes time to clean the wheel and tray it requires my husband or myself to take it apart (after it's been removed from the cage) so the inside can be cleaned. It snaps back together easily enough but getting the sides separated is a real pain. Other than that and the fact that it doesn't really glow in the dark (at least not very brightly), it's a pretty good cage."
5,Great cage,"I own both the CritterTrail Extreme Challenge Habitat and the CritterTrail Z and they both function splendidly!Now, I only wrote this review to chime in with a different note than the very popular 'messy' quote that circles these colorful cage products.Yes, hamsters make messes, and so does any pet, cage or not.You can't give this cage a bad review cause your hamster is what it is.Any cage is going to get messy, and they are going to pee wherever they feel like.Another common subject: Plastic.The plastic breaks and wears easily after a short amount of time. Fact of life. It's not made of steel. The company made it the way they did and people pay for it. A pet is an investment, just like a child, you have to keep feeding it and sheltering it. If one does not like the referenced torment these particular cages bring, go with a glass aquarium (the pet stores do).And if you can't stand a mess, don't own a pet."
1,Think twice before you buy,"Our hamster chose to use the wheel as his den. He spends his time filling the wheel with bedding and food. He sleeps most of the day there, and does his bathroom business. Then, some time in the middle of the night, he wakes up and decides to go for a run in his wheel. What goes in, must come out, and out it comes, all over the place.... bedding, food, feces and urine. I'm constantly cleaning up around the cage. Plus, the urine collects in the wheel housing, that plastic purple thing the wheel sits in, and creates a rather solid, dried urine, feces and bedding mess. It's really quite disgusting, and unsanitary. Plus, it's impossible to open to clean and put back together. The idea was to allow my 6 year old to take on the responsibility of caring for an animal, but she can't clean the cage by herself becuase she can't open and close it by herself."
1,"Horrible, horrible DO NOT BUY","At first, when my daughter had this for her hamster, it seemed like a great product. HEr hamster Miko LOVED it. But after about a month, my daughter looked at the cage and saw that her hamster was hanging upside-down in the wheel with her little foot stuck in the crack. Miko's leg ended up getting swollen and very gross. We all thought that she would die. The next morning when we went to check on her, her leg was gone. Please do not buy this product for the sake of the animals."
1,Not appropriate for gerbils,"I bought this cage when I first got my gerbils, and it was terrible. Even though I had it attached to another CritterTrail cage, I later learned it wasn't enough space for both of them. They had plenty of toys to chew, but they would constantly chew on the bars (one of them broke a tooth that way), and they chewed up the Xtreme Spiral Slide in about five minutes, leaving no access to the Xtreme Wheel. The wheel got stuck after a while and wouldn't spin properly. Also, this thing is an absolute pain to clean, and the gerbils always kicked bedding out onto the floor, so I had to clean that up too.This cage might be big enough for a single mouse or dwarf hamster, but your best bet is to get a glass or plastic tank instead. It's not as Xtreme, but it's cleaner, quieter, safer, and more fun for little pets to dig around in."
2,super pet crittertrail turd tosser,Hamsters love it but the wheel on top of the cage allows poop and seeds to shoot out over the entire room. I have another cage with the wheel at the side and it keeps the droppings right under the wheel. When the hamsters start running small seeds and extras shoot everywhere. Save yourself the headache and get a more contained cage.
1,Looks Cool but Is Not Good At All,"I'll admit it. This cage looks awesome. Thewheel and the portable cage are unbelieveable. It looks really cool, but trust me it isn't It keeps falling apart. The snap on parts don't snap on. AND THE WORST IS MY HAMSTER LIFTED AND PUSHED THE TOP OFF AND ESCAPED. I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM SINCE!!!! DO NOT GET THIS UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR ANIMAL TO ESCAPE."
1,Poorly made.,Terrible product. A pain to put together and take apart. Hamster escaped a few times. Broke in so many places that it ended up being held together with gaffers tape.
2,The water bottle killed my hampster,"I got my daughter a Robo and this cage for Christmas, and a short 3 weeks later the hamster died of dehydration. The water bottle that comes with this has some sort of spring inside that prevented the hamster from being able to drink. It was my first hamster, and very small, so I didn't notice that the water level wasn't moving at all.Fortunately, the cage does have some redeeming qualities. The wheel is pretty neat, as it spins around, and the removable ""look out"" is a good idea. If you oil the wheel when you clean it, it stays pretty quiet.All in all, it's ok, I'm just pretty pissed that now I have to explain to my 6 year old that an engineer killer her hamster."
1,Dont Buy,I bought this cage for our beloved Alvin 2. First of all the cage does not stay together. When you go to clean it the whole cage falls apart. I am not even sure how to get apart the wheel at the top of the cage to clean. Alvin 2 was able to escape from this cage. He never escaped from his Penn Plex Sam cage. We bought this cage to add on. Alvin squeezed through at the top of the cage where the bars hook to the top. Thankfully we found Alvin 2 after her being missing for about 10 hours only for her to die a few days latter. I tried calling the company about this cage but you have to leave a number for them to call you back. They never call back.
2,"Not sturdy, hard to clean...","Bought 2 hamsters for 2 children for Christmas..with two of these cages. One broken within weeks..both broken within month and my kids are not harsh on things. So hard to clean that ""I"" ended up cleaning both. Finally gave both to older kid to hook together and tape up broken parts and use for one of the hamsters. Not impressed although I gave it two stars because the ""hamster"" sure liked running around in it. Basic wire cages are easiest to clean and these things get smelly."
2,!!BAD PRODUCT!!,We have had this cage for one year and the slide has broken off and the peice that conects the roof to the cage broke.It has been a pain to clean because it falls apart.Another thing is that they eat and poop up in the wheel so when they run the food and poop fall through the cracks and after that I can't feed them the same food because it is mixed in with poop.All in all I don't think it was worth my money.
2,You will lose your hamster,The cage is secure and good ... except for the top attachment with the wheel. The hamster will run around a lot and it will slowly move out of its secure spot. Then the whole top wheel attachment will fall off with the hamster in it. I lost my 1st hamster because of this. Still used the cage for my 2nd hamster and its done it twice even though we keep securing it into place. Luckily I still have her because I caught her the 1st time and she landed in a laundry basket the second time ... so we trashed this one and ordered a cage with a wheel inside ... that way she can't run away if it falls off.
3,"Great idea, poor construction","Pros: Gerbils log=ve it. Plenty of exercise for them. glowing plaforms a plus,Cons: You'll constantly be purchasing spare parts. More durable materials are needed to prevent gerbils from chewing it to pieces. This is especially true for the ramp leading to the exercise wheel, You'll have o]to replace this at least once a month a month. Exercise wheel can be difficult to clean."
1,Not the right Habitat for us/ More wheel woes,"My daughter saved up her money to buy this Habitat for her hamster. Our hamster loved the wheel. At first when she ran in the wheel it was noisy. Then our hamster began to use it as a bathroom and food storage. If this wasn't gross enough she would also run in it. Little droppings and seeds would fly out of it and it was incredibly noisy. No matter how many times we cleaned it out the hamster would immediately fill it up again and make a tremendous racket. I would have to clean up around the habitat several times a day. The little observation area on the top is difficult for children to latch, so we had several adventures searching the house for our hamster. Save your money and buy a different Habitat. We're happy with the new 3 level one we bought."
1,"Bars Broke, Wheel a horror","Worst design and cage ever! A bar popped out from where the bars are supposed to be welded together and now my little hamster is dead from it stabbing her! Before that happening, Goldilocks would bring food and bedding into her wheel and then when she would run, it would throw the food, bedding, and droppings everywhere. The urine catch didn't help at all. Also, if you decide to get a different wheel and close the hole where the old one went, there is no room in the cage for a different one because the petting area goes down too far to allow room for the wheel. Save your money and get a better cage! If I could, I wouldn't even give this one star."
1,easy to escape from!,"Usually don't review items, but this one was a problem. The kids liked the cage, but the wheel was loud and stuck. It required some tape to move better, not a big deal. The cage is harder to clean than other brands (we like easy latch dish versions), with lots of areas that really need to get scrubbed down routinely so they don't smell. But the biggest issue was the ease of escape for a hamster! Ours broke out several times a month until we finally replaced the cage! Had a friend with the same cage, at the same time, and the same escape problem. The hatch on top is not secure enough if you like to keep the little pet in."
3,love the cage hate the slide!!,"The cage its self is nice but im not a fan of the slide, our hampster uses it mostly as a potty :-( (he has one also) it also takes up a lot of bottom room it really only fits a dish,potty & a toy.no room for a house or tube."
3,It does the job and the price was right.,We saved a lot of money buying this from Amazon instead of a local pet store which is great. The hamster is very happy but this cage makes a big mess. The wheel has gaps in it and our hamster likes to take bedding and food up there which then falls out on the floor. We ended up buying a large plastic box to put under in cage and we used strong tape to cover the gaps. We still have to vacuum around the area at least twice a week.
3,we,It was cracked. We exchanged it at a different store and 4 others on the shelf were all cracked too so we exchanged for another one by the same company and it was fine. Very cute!!!
4,Great hamster cage!,This is my daughters first hamster cage. I put it together which was really easy and kids can help. The hamsters seem to love it. Lots of little places they can hide and go. At night they can go into the wheel at the top for some running and we purchased some of the critter accessories to add and expand. Good price for what you get.
2,"Great cage, some bad quality.","My gerbil loves the cage, he especially loved chewing the slide. Within a few days of having the cage my gerbil has chewed about half of the slide so it would no longer stand up. I would have thought it would have been made to withstand gerbil teeth."
2,cool looking cage but makes a huge mess!,"My son loved this cage but we returned it after only two days because his hamster insisted on making a nest in the top wheel portion and then running in it, resulting in a big mess. There are slots in the wheel that allow the bedding and food and hamster poo to be thrown all around- really gross. We returned it and got the single level habitat and added on the lazy outlook which has been a much better set up."
3,"Um, not so great!",Cage is pretty cool except the plastic exercise wheel doesn't move much. I have oiled as per the directions but no luck.Plastic wheel on a plastic rod not good design! Going to have to get something with an old school metal wheel!
2,Do NOT buy this cage!!,"I got this cage fo my hamster, and at first it seemed really great. She was afraid to go up in to the wheel and when she did her foot got stuck in the gap and she tried to chew it off. Luckly we broke it in time before she got seriously hurt. The wheel also seemed to get stuck alot. I took the wheel and the slide to get up to the wheel out and there is much more room and she won't get hurt."
3,Okay,"This is an okay product, i dont love it and i dont hate it. Not the most attractive thing ever.........."
4,super pet crittertrail extreme challenge habitat,"This cage was easy to clean, easy to put together, and take apart for cleaning. Perfect for small size teddy bear hamsters. Not good for shavings if you have hamsters that like to use the wheel as a nest, better for critter care pet bedding. As the wheel moves shavings go everwhere along with any waste they might have released up in the wheel."
1,Do NOT use for dwarf hamsters!,"Extreme Challenge - We've had ours for 8 days. Tonight, my husband was walking by the cage and noticed that our dwarf hamster was 3/4 of the way out of his cage through an opening in the side door of the cage. This is an unvelievable design flaw. He didn't bend it or break anything, he just crawled right through the slighty larger opening between two rungs just under the area where you squeeze to unlatch the door. He did eventually get all the way through it."
4,cool but a little messy,Our hamsters also make a nest in the wheel. Stuff falls onto the area outside the cage and makes a mess. Other than that It's EASY to clean. My 11yr old cleans it herself with no help or problems. I would recommend it. It looks great and wont easily break like someone else suggested.
2,"hard to clean, and it broke","The wheel was quiet for about a week, and then whenever it rotated it made a terrible scraping noise. The wheel and its mount are also very hard to clean, and you have to disassemble the entire cage to clean it properly. My mouse also found a way to chew the wires and a few of them ended breaking off and she could escape. I used this for a few months before I got too frustrated with it. If you have a pet that likes to use their wheel as a bathroom, as my mouse did, definitely do not buy this, because I had to take the entire wheel mount off to clean it(besides it's a closed wheel so you can't just wipe it down while still attached), and it's not easy to disassemble."
3,A fun little house.,"This product is a fun little space, but it all depends on what kind of living space your hamster is used to. The lookout area is awesome because it comes out on its own and makes it very easy to clean the cage. The top doesn't fit completely securely with the wire part of the cage, but the tube keeps it together so that the hamster won't escape. The water bottle leaks because of the design (it is not the water bottle that has a little ball for them to push up and get the water out of like other cages) and therefore it just drips water out throughout the day and gets the bottom of the cage wet. The spiral slide if fun and the wheel is cool because it glows in the dark, however; the wheel is a little slim and should really only be used for teddy bear hamsters."
4,funny cage,"I bought this one to seperate my baby hamsters dad. He has his own extra sleeping & storage room, plus bath room and tolit, so he never mess the top wheel. This is the best price for buying such a big function cage. A lot of fun for me and my hamster dad Adward."
2,A mess!,"Our hampster brings all his food and filler to the ball and it's a HUGE mess - the floor, the tabletop, etc . .."
3,Hamster cage,"Overall this is a neat product. Our hamster seems to love all the different areas to explore. I only gave it 3 stars because it does seem slightly flimsy (yes I put it together correctly) and the wheel on top makes ALOT of noise. It doesn't seem to spin as well as it should when the hamster is on it. It also leaves a white residue from turning. The ""sleeping"" area is alot smaller then I would like since the house we bought her takes up all the space, and it isn't that big. But she does manage to climb on top and get around just fine. I don't think I would buy one again if given the chance. But it still is a neat idea, I just wish it was made better."
1,Awful!,"The cage is built with good enough quality, but after using it for two weeks, we are really unhappy with it. The hamsters have moved most of the stuffing into the wheel. They poop in there and everything, and then try to use the wheel sending poop, food, and stuffing everywhere! IT IS SO MESSY! Our kids can't even get our hamsters to come out of the wheel to even hold or play with them. DON'T BUY THIS CAGE! I wish I would have looked on amazon before purchasing this cage."
2,Had to return it,"Bought this thinking it would be cool, but the ball that rolls around on top rarely worked and would always get stuck. Also, getting my mouse out of it was really hard to do. The mouse loved it, that's the only reason I gave it 2 stars. Much more hassle then it was worth. Returned it for a basic"
2,May cause hampster injury!,The hampsters were loving the cage and wheel. Then I heard the hampster squeaking and entered to find that her leg had gotten caught in the small opening on the wheel. She was stuck. I helped get her leg out and it appears that she has a slight cut and is limping a bit on her back leg. I immediately put tape over the opening so this won't happen again and may need to remove wheel all together.
1,"THIS SUCKS, DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","We lost 3 Chinese dwarf hamsters in 3 months! They will easily climb up the cage walls if even the smallest part is loose. They will bite the spring that holds the door. This is a cheap, plastic 30 dollar rip off! Negative 999,999,999,999,999,999,999.999999999999784283750 stars 4 this company. Even the ball/wheel stinks. They will get their foot stuck in those giant cracks and then they will bite their own foot off! Do not buy!A tip for if your little furball escapes is put food on top of a sheet of tinfoil in every room of your house, it will come to get the food and you will hear it. Close the door behind u to make sure he/she does not escape. Stack stuff on top of each other to lead up to a bucket were u put loose paper on top of the bucket. Put food on there so it will come up ur stacked materials. It will try to get the food but it will fall into the bucket."
3,Kinda gross.,"First of all, it's super hard to assemble. Second, once you do assemble it most hamster like to sleep in the wheel. The wheel has openings so it can breath, but food and bedding and ""other"" things go right through it. It makes quite a mess after awhile. We have to clean constantly. It's a very nice and she likes to go in and out of the tunnels, but the mess can be a problem. Other than that its an amazing cage. Don't let the fact that it can get messy detour you from getting it."
3,Good,"I was very pleased to receive my package for this but it wasn't very easy to put it together with, because we didn't have very good detailed instructions. Poor instructions."
3,Eh...,"Love the idea for this cage, but plastic is definitely NOT a good idea for small animals. Our Gerbil's chewed through half of the ramp from the bottom up. Then they chewed through the part that holds the ramp to the roof and wheel entrance and the ramp fell into the cage. So now they don't have a ramp or a wheel to run on... Going to buy another cage that isn't plastic!"
2,Don't buy this.,"Where do I start? The water bottle leaks,it's too small for a hamster and it falls apart easily. I mean you look at thins thing wrong and it falls apart! My hamster figured out so many ways to escape from the cage. The wheel is also loud. You're better off buying an aquarium and a cage topper. I was a first time pet owner when I bought this, please learn from my mistakes!! DON'T BUY THIS!"
2,Hope you aren't a light sleeper!,"Bought this cage for my daughter's hamster. Love the actual cage, however, the ""Space"" wheel on the top of the cage is HORRIBLE. Since most hamsters are nocturnal, and choose to play at NIGHT, our hamster loves to get in the wheel while we are sleeping and even though the cage is downstairs, when the house is quiet, the wheel makes alot of noise. When I say ALOT, I mean ALOT. It rattles and squeaks. We have had to resort to putting the cage in a closed room while we sleep now. We are thinking of buying a replacement accessory to avoid the hassle. Cage is worth the money but be prepared to put ear plugs in. You could definitely not put this cage in the kids' rooms."
3,Sturdy but hard to clean,"The cage is good for the most part, but a pain to clean. We like to clean the cage out with soap and water every week which ends up taking about 20 minutes. The difficult part is putting it back together. The metal part of the cage is actually split into two pieces, but they're connected to the top and bottom as well as two more small plastic panels that allow the tubes to be connected to the cage. It's difficult to get all six main pieces in the right spot to get it locked together.One night we didn't get it locked together properly and the hamster pushed the cage apart and escaped. Prior to that, the hamster escaped by opening the front door. Now we push the cage up against the wall so she can't escape."
2,"Looks cool, that's it.","This cage is not very functional, and the wheel literally sprays crap all over the place. It's also really hard to get the hamsters out. Do not buy."
3,Messy,"This cage may be fine for some hamsters, but for some reason, ours doesn't really use the wheel for exercise. He has built a nest in it. There is bedding, food, etc. in the ""wheel"" and he sleeps there alot. I find that the food, bedding, etc. comes out of the small holes in the bottom and falls on the ""track"" below and also all over the top of the cage and the table it's on. I was a little disappointed but it may just be our hamster isn't normal."
3,Super Pet CritterTrail Extreme Challenge Habitat,"This is a cute little set-up. However, the wheel really squeaks and sometimes wakes my daughter up. We have oiled it which helps some, but it's still a bit noisy. Also, the hamster poop can slip through the crack in the wheel, making for a tiny mess. We thought the wheel looked a bit loose, like it might come apart so we taped it up a bit to hold it together. Not sure if it would have actually come apart, but didn't want to risk finding the hamster in the mouth of one of our cats or dogs. Pocket, the hamster, seems really happy in her little habitat and loves, loves, loves the wheel and sleeping in the small compartment on top."
2,Do Not Buy This Cage,"First of all - it's hard to clean - it doesn't stay together very well - not as if you lift the top and dump the shavings.Second of all... ""Biggy Smalls"" climbs up in the wheel thingy, poops in there, and then when he walks, it falls thru the vent-holes. Might as well be a chimp flinging his doodoo everywhere.It's a MESS!"
