1,Please do NOT read,"I did not finish the book (I got about 70% of the way through before I realized I could not bear to read one more page). Maybe the remaining part of the book would have been better, but I doubt it. This is the first time I can ever remember not even having even the slightest interesting in finishing a book. The characters were flat and plot went nowhere. Please - there are million of books out there. Spare yourself, and find something else to read. Anything."
2,"Predator should be titled, ""The Perils of Pauline.""","I used to love this series, but how can one enjoy a book where all the characters in it are miserable? I enjoy a good mystery; a good one makes you want to peek at the ending, just to see if you figured everything out correctly. I plowed through this book, just to finish it. I didn't get the feeling of genuine surprise or verification as I do in other mysteries.I am an avid reader. I have noticed over the years that books by Cornwell and her ilk are becoming smaller and smaller. Are the publishers telling their authors to limit their books to a certain number of pages to save money? You can almost visualize the outline in most of them, they are so thin. The characters become caricatures."
1,Waste of time,"I have read all of the Kay Scarpetta books by Patricia Cornwell but found this to be very disjointed. In fact, I got so tired of trying to keep on track that I finally decided it wasn't worth the time or effort. I did not finish reading it! Other books awaited."
1,Predator,Do not waste your time. I have read over 50 books this year and this has got to be the worst. Fame does not make a great book.
1,So disappointing,"I found the book mostly entertaining until the end. I was very disappointed by the convoluted story, and things were not explained very well at the end.I loved all her other books, but this one was horrible. I found it much more violent and disturbing than previous books, too. The stupid DID ending came out of nowhere and made no sense (maybe she has been watching too much One Life to Live). There were too many characters, too many plot threads, too many murders, and it was not tied together very well. I have to agree with most of the other reviewers. I sure hope her next one is better."
1,Kay Scarpetta should consider retirement,I'm normally a fan of PC and I've considered her books to be a good safe read. Nothing flashy but generally a decent story line and a lot of criminology thrown in. But her latest (Predators) was far and away her worst effort and her editors and agents should take a serious look at this franchise. It is in trouble. The overall one and half star rating is a gift and only because we aren't allowed to rate less than one star.Patricia Cornwell is a much better writer than this and she clearly has grown tied of Scarpetta and the rest of the characters.
1,Boring,"I keep HOPING with each book, Cornwell will regain some of the glory of the earlier stories. It obviously isn't happening with this installment. The book reads like a rushed first draft that was never seen by the editor. You don't care about the characters, the plot is contrived, and the suspense is nonexistant. As of this book I am officially giving up on Scarpetta and her adventures, which is such a same"
1,Predator,"Easily the worst book Cornwell has ever written. Intentionally scrambled-- to the point of being obtuse-- it employs the hackneyed device of multiple personality disorder. My disappointment is so profound, I am swearing off Cornwell's work. Fool me once..."
1,Don't Bother,"I enjoyed the Kay Scarpetta mysteries in the beginning. This last one is a waste of time and money. If I hadn't paid for the book myself, I wouldn't have finished reading it."
1,Cornwell is off my list,"I used to LOVE Patricia Cornwell -- the tight, first-person narrative, the complex crimes and descriptions and the interesting, involved characters. The series took a marked hit after Point of Origin and went completely into the trashcan with Blowfly. Why the sudden switch to third person? The last three books have been less about forensic science and more about how much the characters can put the mean in dysfunctional. It's almost as if a different person is writing these books. I picked up Predator from the library (because she went off my ""buy"" list a few books ago) and, after the first chapter, basically skimmed the rest. It takes a LOT for me not to finish a book -- this one was horrible."
2,Disappointed,"I have eagerly awaited each new Cornwell book, and have been disappointed. I really was unhappy with this one. The story was great and interesting and then BOOM it just ended. There was almost no explanation, no clues that I had missed, just information that wasn't given. It was as if she had written and then some one said ""Oh, it's due to the publisher tomorrow""This one I did not keep in my library."
1,The Worst I've ever Read,"Don't buy this book at all. Bad, Bad, Bad.Wait till you can borrow it from someone and then only if you have nothing else to read. Whatta waste of great talent and of a once great series of books. PC must have been drunk when writing this one or just sold out."
1,Call 911 - a crime has been committed - it's the publishing and distribution of this book,"As with another reviewer, my star rating could actually be a ""zero"" if the system allowed for it. I have been a faithful Cornwell reader throughout this series and have only seen the storylines and character development continue to disintegrate over the past few books. However, Predator takes the cake. This is positively the worst attempt by this talented author in her career. The storyline was confusing and frustrating and did not engage this reader at all. The stagnant relationships among the characters need to either terminate or move on. Sorry to say, I'll never determine if this happens in the next book because I won't be buying another Scarpetta mystery. I do have one question for the publisher - did anyone actually read this book before it was distributed?"
1,I give up,"I officially give up on Cornwall and Kay. The initial books were great. If you are starting the series, read them in order. They last 5 tend to peter out as she goes for the money only."
1,predator,"Nothing new.Mean , meaner, P.C.Show off.Product placement.A strange facination of guns and how to harm other humans in the most dreadful ways. Bvadddhr. Hopeless relations among women and men: In Scandinavia there is a name for it: Femi-krimi.

I think you can imagine what I am getting at.Kind RegardsOle, Copenhagen, Denmark"
3,Predator by Patricia Cromwell,"You need to have read this author's previous books before reading this one to appreciate it. For a first book by this author, it is very discombobulated and my mother, whom I bought this book, couldn't follow it and she is a voracious reader."
2,With apologies to Rob Thomas:,"I started out clean but I'm jaded,just phoning it in,well just breaking the skin.Can you help me, I'm bent, I'm so scared that I'll never get put back together....."
1,My last Scarpetta book,"For years, since I first discovered Patricia Cornwell, her books were on my ""buy in hardback"" list. I began to be disillusioned with her when she brought Benton back to life, and this book didn't give me any reason to change my mind. I waited for the paperback, read it, and decided that I don't need to waste my time reading Cornwell any longer. I don't enjoy all of the angst - I kept wishing that Kay & Benton would just TALK to each other, for goodness sake! I used to like these people, but not any longer. The mystery itself was okay, but for me all the sturm and drang outweighed that part of the book. If you want a good forensic mystery, read the Tempe Brennan books by Kathy Reichs."
1,"Not on the ""TEAM"" anymore","I was hoping that this would be the Cornwell book that brought back some of the original greatness of Scarpetta and friends. All I read was page after page of miserable characters who do not like themselves, their surroundings, their friends etc. Mercifully, I called it quits on page 80 when ""...the carcass will ""TEAM"" with maggots..."". At that point I ""put a fork in it - it's done!!!"" C'mon Putnam, you didn't have to drop the ball down in editing too!."
1,Worst Yet!!!!!!!,"If I could give it a half star I would. I don't know what has happened to Patricia Cornwell. She used to be my favorite author, and I used to love the Kay Scarpetta books. Now I have to slog my way thru one of her books. She needs to get back to her basics. I know authors are supose to evolve, but I don't see that happening here. It just seem like she's trying to get thru the book. The writing isn't as fun. I hate what she's done to Pete Marino, and Lucy just keeps getting more and more whiny. I personally wish she would kill her off, and Dr. Scarpetta just seems self righteous. Everyone should tell her everything , but she doesn't have to share. I have never been as disapointed in one of her books as I was in this. Maybe it time to give it up."
2,Not worth the money,"I used to be a huge Kay Scarpetta fan, but as several other reviewer have stated - I am no longer. I found this on a discount table at a bookstore while I was traveling and looking for a book to read. For someone who can go through a book I enjoy in a day or two, this took me months to finish. Cornwell's books have been on a steady decline. She no longer is intriguing or even interesting and her characters are now worse than reading soap-opera scripts. I do have to thank Cornwell however, because of her awful works, I have ventured out and discovered some other genres and interesting authors."
1,"Patricia, Patricia, Patricia","I had given up on her books, but recieved PREDATOR as a gift, so I read it. Now I,ve really given up. A gift will become a return. She creates new charactors, but tries to pass them off as ""old charactors"". Can""t she create new names to identify new charators or are they all split personality pychopaths.? Besides that, there is a blatant error on the first page of chapter 47. A Harley motorcycle running at 139,000 rpms?? Perhaps she meant MPH?? Just 2 pages later "" It doesn't make sense to increase the engine some thirteen percent...."". What?Thirteen percent of what? Does this paragraph make sense or connect to anything? Sorry Patricia, you have lost it and your editors have lost it. Time to pack up the Scarpetta series before you turn us all in to multiple personality psychopaths."
2,Convoluted plot,"This is an extremely convoluted novel. There are multiple subplots which seem disconnected but then at the end are coincidentally brought together (maybe??). You spend half your time trying to figure out who's who. Maybe it's time for Cornwell to go back to ""plot"" school."
1,pathetic hodgepodge masquerading as mystery,"Cornwell has run out of steam. Her prose is floundering, a massive mix of as many suspense themes as possible in an attempt to cover up the fact that she has no ""novel"" (pun intended) ideas. One feels that she really doesn't like any of her characters. It's all rather sad. And Marino's corny characterization comes across as though a little old maid were writing about what she thinks a macho cop must be like. It's really sad to see a once-interesting group of characters devolve into the depressed malcontents that populate Predator."
2,"Unfortunately, I agree","I just finished Predator. I had to read it all, kind of like the way someone can not keep from looking at a train wreck. I really enjoyed Patricia Cornwell's Scarpetta novels until Blowfly, when she started writing third person present tense - my least favorite style of writing to read. I feel like suddenly her books are some sort of writing assignment because they are that weird. All of her characters are broken, miserable and depressing to read. I actually had a hard time following the plot. And this is a Scarpetta book not War and Peace. The predators were trite and the ending was sort of pulled out of,well, I don't know where. I am going to read the only Scarpetta book that I missed; ""All That Remains"". This one I know I will like..."
1,Why Ms. Cornwell? Why???,"I was terribly disappointed by Patricia Cornwell's latest book, Predator. I have been a big fan of the previous novels, but this one made me wonder if Cornwell hired a ghost writer. Without spoiling the plot, for those I can't dissuade from wasting their time reading this, there are plot lines that seem to be very important that peter out without any further mention, or resolution. Pete Marino, a character I have always liked, that seemed street-wise, if predjudiced, comes off as a brutish bufoon, and hints are given as to the nature of his moodiness, but again, no resolution. Her attempts to give us the criminal's point of view come off as silly and repetitive, and I guess I now have a very good idea what an MRI machine sounds like, but have no idea why it was so important.My advice: if you love Kay Scarpetta, Benton Wesley, Pete Marino, et al, let them rest in peace in your memories, but let them go. They're dead now."
2,Scarpetta scrambled,"I used to love Patrica Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta, but as time goes on she has lost a plot in a big way. The relationship between Scarpetta / Lucy / Benton becomes gradually more disfunctional and bizzare. Marino has gone so far off the rails that I seriously expect to see that he is in fact a serial killer himself. These flaws could be excused if the plot was solid, but unfortunately even there we are let down. Once again Scarpetta, Lucy and Benton are all investigating different murders which bizzarrly are all coincidentally related (this has happened too many times before to be interesting), and the killer is once again playing a game that sets the main characters against one another.My advice to a reader - don't waste your time reading this book, you've read all the component parts of the story in other Cornwell books.My advice to Cornwell - go back to the original format of simple death investigation and quit slipping off into the realms of psychobabble"
1,After You're Done,"After the excutiating excercise of finishing this preposterous literary effort (and I use the term loosely) much less paying for the priviledge, I speculated on what to do with the book. Not having any broken beds to prop up I considered another reviewer's suggestion of donating it to a library. No, that wouldn't work because it might be inadvertantly read by someone whose IQ is above their body temperature and do irreperable damage to any future inclination to read decent fiction. So the only logical solution is to quickly place 'Predator'in a recycling bin. Hence it's only redeeming value will be conversion to cardboard and perhaps in a future life be an Amazon shipping container that will deliver far more worthwhile reading material. In the spirit of the holiday season I wish Ms. Cornwell all the best, but please, NO MAS with future Scarpetta drivel."
2,What Happened?,"I grew up reading Kay Scarpetta novels. The old novels were fantastically intricate, wonderfully written stories with engaging characters and great plots. But ever since Blowfly, the books have been steadily declining. The Third person view was the right setup, not the new first person style. And now that you read what the killers are thinking, it's just too easy. These books used to be about the crimes, with just enough personal drama thrown in to make it interesting. Now, it's mostly personal stuff and very little actual plot. All in all, this book was a disappointment."
1,Cornwell's Hit Bottom,"I've read all of Patricia Cornwell's Scarpetta series and their quality and readibility have declined at a rapid pace. Blowfly was a big disappointment and Predator is even worse.The plot is disjointed, the characters have become caricatures, and there is no suspense. I'm only happy that, after purchasing Blowfly in hardback, that my only investment in this sad novel was gas to get me to the library. Oh, and my investment of time when I could have been reading Kathy Reich's Break No Bones."
2,Couldn't Finish It,I give up on Patricia Cornwell. Is it money and fame that crushes so many authors' creativity and authenticity? It appears so in this book.
1,very disappointing,"Wow, this book really stunk. The plot was too convoluted, which meant that ultimately there were dozens of loose ends when the book was over; virtually none of the mystery was resolved. I've totally lost interest in the main characters (Scarpetta et al.) because they have all become sour and tired. If Cornwell can't do better than this she would do well to start a new series (although I can't say that I liked her non-Scarpetta novels)."
1,Don't Bother,This is another disappointing Patricia Cornwell book. Her older books were wonderful and I could hardly put them down. But lately they leave much to be desired. I also notice that James Patterson's books have become poorly written as well.
2,Disjointed; confused,"Kay Scarpetta was one of the best charcters ever and I've read every one of the books but as already mentioned, the Patricia Cornwell books have gone downhill. They are much darker, depressing and gorier than at the beginning of the series. Predator was hard to get into because of the disjointed, jumpy style of writing. Also, at the end many plot points were left up in the air regarding who actually did what killings and the motive. I normally don't mind that Cornwell doesn't tie up everything neatly at the end but if you've invested a number of hours in reading the book, you'd at least like to be able to figure out what happened when it was over. I ended up confused."
1,Why Patricia?,"You were one of the best in your field. I looked forward to a new Kay Scarpetta novel like a kid at a candy store. Now I just marvel at how downhill your writing has become. The characters are one dementional, it is hard to follow the plot line ect. you've seen it all before. You can't rest on your name forever, we know you have the talent from your earlier work. Go back and look at it, that was what made you Patricia Cornwell. Not Predator."
1,What was she thinking?,"I haven't been reading Cornwell novels since they kept getting progressively worse. I hoped she had improved so I took a chance and bought the book. I should have put my money on a lottery ticket. This book was dreadful. It jumped around as though Cornwell was writing as though each chapter was another book. The characters were all depressed and unhappy and the story was totally and completely unbelieveable!! I could go on, but I just want to forget I wasted my time and toss this one in my trash bin. Final comment - Don't buy this book!"
2,Disappointing,"Scarpetta and her crew have lost appeal...the characters are angry, bitter and secretive. What happened to those the relationships? Will wait for paperback and hope for the best in Cornwell's next..."
1,Awful!,"I note that several reviews suggested waiting for a library copy, rather than purchasing this book. Well, don't count on your local libraary buying a copy! This series has become so bad, that libraries are saving their money for titles that are readable."
1,Present tense?,"Why write in the present tense? From the beginning, I knew it was going to be different, but not this bad. The poorly constructed plot lines made it seem like it was put together with little thought. My advice would be to stay away from this book."
1,Too dysfunctional and gloomy,"I have read all the Kay Scarpetta books. The earlier ones were enjoyable. I like following a series where I get to know the characters. They become like my own family. Unfortunately, the characters have become all dysfunctional in this story. If I had never read any of the previous Kay Scarpetta books, I would not have gotten past the first hour of this one.I also enjoy a good whodunit, but I don't care for serial killers and Cornwell seems to be getting more and more into the minds of kinky serial killers. I can't relate to that and don't want to. Whatever happened to a good old fashioned murder mystery where the motive was greed, jealousy or blackmail?"
1,Another disappointment,"The sudden jump to third person strikes me as indicative that this franchise is simply a business for Cornwell. She has completely divorced herself from the characters when she used to be deeply involved in all aspects of their development. The forensics are non-existent, since Scarpetta is a consultant rather than a practicioner. I read this not too long ago, and I hardly remember what it was about.I keep buying these, hoping that the author will revert back to her old form, but like everyone else, I continue to be disappointed. I probably won't stop reading them, but I sure won't be paying full hardback prices."
1,the thrill is gone,"The last several of Cornwell's books have been awful. Trite plotlines; too much personal angst; missing forensics and mystery. I have sworn not to spend another dime on her books because there are too many other great writers out there that still give a good bang for the buck - Connelly, Sandford, James Lee Burke among many others. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. Do not be sucked in by the ""smear campaign"" theory. These reviews have been written because her work has become poor quality. Perhaps it is time for Ms. Connelly to either retire the series or get focused on what made her early works so wonderful."
2,This is still not up to Patricia Cornwel's previous work,"It is a long time since she shocked with; ""From Potters Field""There is a lot of psykobabble here and verly little story. The jumping from place to place with litllecoherence just makes this book a bad read.I still give 2 starts for the effort, and being a Patricia Cornwell fan, I am willing to forgive a lot.If this is your first meeting with Scarpetta... Dont't.Pick up ""Post Mortem"" and read the first few books first."
1,Very Disappointing,"I have (had) been a fan of Patricia Cornwell for many years. I would eagerly await the new novels and especially the Kay Scarpetta series. The last 2 in this series have been so disappointing that I will not buy another of her books. I will try to get them at the local library and see if my disappointment in her writing these last couple of years is unfounded, but will not spend my money until I am reassured that the books are worth my investment. Her characters have become weak and her plotlines trite. Her main character (Kay in this book) seems to have lost her edge and the lesbian situations in these last few books are just not my cup of tea. I would like for her to go back to the ""medical examiner"" situations and storylines. I learned quite a bit of forensic science when I was reading her earlier Kay Scarpetta and would like to see the return of this aspect of her writings."
1,Cornwell is losing steam,"Like many others here I used to be Scarpetta's biggest admirer and PC's biggest fan.I could hardly finish this book, it was so bad. I think she is simply losing her steam. She's worn out her characters, her plots are boring and when I read this I felt that it was written simply to maybe fulfill contractual obligations. She certainly did not write with the same energy as her past Scarpetta novels. Maybe creating a new series would be better than endlessly milking these by now very sad characters."
3,PREDATOR??????,"The way the story flows is as great usual but for true fans who have watched Lucy grow and cried with Kay, gotten furious at Benton.......The characters weren't explored in depth. I've read all of the Kay books and own most but as for how the crime was solved bravo. How the characters emotions and interactions among each other were lacking. Kay and Benton are they over or gonna actually attempt to resume their love and respect for each other as friends and lovers? friends? lovers? enemies? co workers? Is Lucy ever gonna have peace and lover for herself? Marino will he ever get Kay? Will he accept it? Will he find love for himself? What about his son Rocky, will he ever have peace with that aspect of his self? I feel as if now you are only focusing on the crimes when so much of the appeal for the Kay series is that you show us the heros and criminals as humans....."
1,Like watching paint dry,"I am a long time reader of Patricia Cornwell's work. I'm totally shocked at this book. Not only is her book out of character, I suspect it has resulted from a weekend project that was late for a publisher deadline.A critic of grammar is not my forte, but even for the untrained this book is loaded with grammatical and spelling errors easily noticeable by laymen. I certainly hope Patricia is more inclined to produce better work on her next book.Patricia's past writings have always been known to be very descriptive with the ability to whisk a reader away into another realm, leaving them captive and feeling it is hard to put a book down midway through reading. This one sorely lacks imagination and makes it hard to pick up after each chapter and makes it difficult for a reader to commit anything in the book to memory and to follow what exactly what they are reading. To finish the book is more an obligation than a pleasure."
3,Falling Apart,"Like a few others I have read Cornwell on and off for years. I really enjoyed her earlier Scarpetta mysteries. Trace, the novel before Predator, seemed like things MIGHT be getting back on track, but the last 25 pages of that book ruined it for me. Predator was much of the same. The story started out promising, but when did Marino become such a jerk? When did Lucy become so self destructive? And the side story of Scarpetta and Benton was a joke.All in all the book wasn't bad, but there is nothing to really recommend it either. If you are a big Cornwell fan, you won't be disappointed, but I don't think you will be pleased either."
1,Huh????,Ms. Cornwell has gone over to the dark side. My only hope is that she returns before she writes her next book.
1,Sloppy,"This is the first Cornwell book I couldn't finish. In earlier books the evil was fascinating, but now it's just revolting. The book comes across as sloppy and self-indulgent. If the Scarpetta series continues, I hope the author will allow the characters to grow (and grow up). The author is very talented and I think she needs to take a major hiatus and start again--her earlier books are excellent."
1,Predator,"I have read all of the Scarpetta series and this latest one, unlike many of her previous, is, in a word, is ""putdownable""I think Ms. Cornwell is bored with Scarpetta."
1,""" Predator "" Poor at Best","I was a huge Patricia Cornwell fan until this book. I noticed in ""Trace"" she was not writing in a true early Cornwell flare... but, I just chalked it up to difficult writing.Predator goes no where quickly! it has lost the background of it main characters and P.C is leaving off main elements of the story that leaves the readers with questions. A writer can do this with screen plays (directors will fill in the empty spots) but, in a novel the reader must feel they are there right beside Dr. Kay Scarpetta.I am sorry I wasted my money on this novel. I think Ms. Cornwell has just about burnt out the Dr. Scarpetta stories."
2,Depressing Characters/Depressing Book,This series has run out of gas. I don't know how the characters go from day to day their lives are so empty and miserable. The villains are so over the top evil that they are ridiculous. We've bought our last episode of Kay Scarpetta.
2,Needs some research...,"I'm sorry to say this, but, for me, too, this series is going in the clunker. The characterization has already been discussed by others, so I won't go there.I'm a computer professional, not a forensic pathologist, so I can't comment on that science. However, this is the second book in the series that I can think of offhand where the whole plot has hinged on the ""brilliant"" Lucy doing stupid things that would get any professional in the computer field fired on the spot for incompetence. Maybe I'm a geek, but I can't maintain suspension of disbelief."
1,"sadly, a waste of time and money","Most of the Scarpetta series have been good reads, with a few exceptions, and I always look forward to Cornwell's new books. This book is beyond being an exception to her normal standard - it is simply a waste. The plot is weak, events and people take up pages for no apparent reason, the ending is a disappointment, Lucy and Marino are both overblown and are distractions, and Scarpett herself is virtually irrelevant. Save your money and time to invest in something more entertaining and engaging, and hope that Cornwell gets back on track with her novels in the immediate future!"
1,This can't be Scarpetta,"I have enjoyed the Kay Scarpetta series and recommended them to many friends; particularly good for a summer read. But the last few books have been flat, lifeless and lacking in plot. I can't believe this is the same Cornwell who wrote Body Farm and others that were so readable, I couldn't stop long after midnight. I had to force myself to finish this one - can't be a real Cornwell, can it?? Where oh where did Scarpetta crawl off to??"
1,The worst yet!,"I used to enjoy reading Patricia Cornwell in the early days. I now find her books to be extremely tedious to read. This current book, Predator, was the worst one yet. I am quite disappointed in Cornwell as an author. She needs to spend more time on the meat of the story, than hopping around from character to character. Speaking of characters, I think she gives me far more information than I need about her characters."
2,Very disappointing....,"I have really enjoyed Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series... up until now. This book was so scattered with too many characters, side stories trying to bring together Kay, Benton, Marino, and Lucy. This story was dark, gritty, smutty, and very confusing.Normally, the Kay Scarpetta series covers Kay's life... but PREDATOR used Kay as an almost unimportant side character. All in all, it was a very disappointing effort by Cornwell.I would only recommend purchasing this in paperback if you must... or borrow it from your local library. :("
2,I've read better... gorey,I have read several of this author and this on just seemed more GORE and HORROR than she normally gets into. The premis was good.. just the expounding of it was bad. There is only so much my mind can take of the depravity of others before it really gets to me. And there were several sub plots that never had any endings. I am sure that is because she writes other books with some of the same characters.. but sometimes i think there should be certain endings.. with some themes. That didn't happen here so it left you hanging to a certain degree.
1,Not a Hit on this reading list,"Something just isn't right with how Cornwell has laid the work for this latest Scarpetta thriller. I can't put my fingers on it. I'm sure all the other reviewers have given a good analysis of what's missing, but I don't know. I'm still hoping for more. Here's wishing the next chapter to the Kay files is a better read!"
3,not all bad,"Despite the other reviews, I enjoyed this book--but I have always enjoyed being read to. Audiophile is wrong about one thing, however. The reader should have looked up the correct pronunciations of the chemicals. If you know the chemicals but not the forensics, it was a bit hard and distracting to figure out what was being read."
4,Not Bad. Not Great,"This book feels like Pat Cornwell is getting tired of writing about Kay Scarpetta and the other characters. Or maybe she was rushing to meet deadlines. There was a lot missing, some areas where she could have gone into more detail to paint a better picture for readers, but she didn't.As far as reading the book went, the plot was good, just not as developed as we have all come to expect. It was, unfortunately, a fast read.Pat, if you're tired of writing about Scarpetta, create new characters and a new plot line. Your faithful readers will follow."
1,Is there a zero star?,"I was a true Scarpetta fan at the beginning of the series, but with each new book it has gone downhill. I have grown to dislike the characters, they are boring and irritating. With this book I didn't make it past page 80. Especially annoying to me is the present tense story telling. This was my last Cornwell purchase."
1,Predator - certainly not her best,"Patricia has gone off the deep end with this book. Her earlier books were incredible, but these characters that we have come to love and enjoy are so disfunctional and the plot so convoluted that it left me feeling wrung out and wishing I hadn't bothered to take the time to read it. Patricia needs to get back to reality with real characters that do some good old fashioned sleuthing. I'll try one more of her books, but if no better, sorry that's it!"
2,Don't read this out of sequence,"I got this accidentally from a book club and since I normally enjoy the Scarpetta books I kept it. I finished it last night. Don't ask me what it is about, because I have no idea. I missed several books in the series, and unlike some mystery series writers, Cornwell gives little back story to catch you up. The changes in some familiar characters were baffling to me. The whole set-up is more like a poor-man's James Bond than good a forensic exploration (maybe she thinks there are too many forensics shows on TV for us to be interested in that anymore). The loose ends are numerous, and the denouement ridiculous. I gave it two stars because the writing was still good enough to keep me engaged, and I kept hoping it would all make sense in the end. Unless you are a hard-core fan, skip this one."
1,Did I Miss Something?,"Like many other reviewers, I've been a Scarpetta follower for some time. I was disappointed in ""Trace"", but couldn't help but request the latest, ""Predator"", from my library anyway. Right away, something seemed amiss. What happened to the 1st person perspective? This present tense 3rd person is irritating to read, and I feel as though I missed something. There wasn't a whole other book in between, was there?? When did Marino become a Harley guy, and what's the deal with Lucy?I tried to stick it out for the first 100 pages, then decided to see what the reviewers said. Now that I know it's not just me, I'll move on to another book in my stack and say so long to the Patricia Cornwell series."
1,A real clunker,"Wow, this one may be the one that does me in. As if returning Benton from the dead weren't bad enough, as if putting Marino on the South Beach diet weren't bad enough, as if destroying Lucy's career with the Federal government weren't enough, Cornwell's characters, formerly thoughtful and three-dimensional, have become faded copies of copies of themselves. The plot thumps painfully along like a Buick with a flat, the story is as dull as dishwater, and the suspense...well, there isn't any. Poor Dr. Scarpetta--will we ever get a read where one (or more) of her faithful, trusted employees DOESN'T turn on her again? This book's going in the ""Friends of the Library Sale"" box. Like one of Scarpetta's cases, Predator is a real stinker."
1,Patricia Cornwell's endless loop,"Cornwell's latest effort continues her lackluster performance. Cornwell never met a plot twist she didn't like; unfortunately, though, she's only ever met one or two. This latest relies on devices she has used, and overused, before. Lucy's inpenetrable computer security system penetrated by one of her self-destructive flings, Marino's boorish behaviour, and Scarpetta's inability to have a meaningful relationship with herself, let alone with another human being. Add to this the fact that what little there is new in this story Cornwell ""borrowed"" from the real-life National Forensic Academy, and you'll find very little new or original in plot, character development or technical details. Altogether a great disappointment - save your money for the next Kathy Reichs book."
1,Very Disapointing,"I read all the Scarpetta novels as soon as they are released. to say this one was disappointing to say the least . I couldnt follow it , what has become of Marino & Lucy ?? . I know Scarpetta fans will want to read it but if your curious don't bother . If there was half a star I would have rated it that , this is almost bad ! I look forward to a return to form in the next release."
1,Please note this is not a new book! Kindle version is new however the book was published in hardback in 2005!!,I purchased this kindle book after receiving an email from amazon saying it was Patricia Cornwell's new book and released in 2012. However - it is not. Was released in 2005 or 2006. Hope I get a full refund and can prevent others from purchasing in error.Predator (Scarpetta)
2,Bitter and depressing,"Murder mysteries and thrillers aren't expected to be happy and uplifting, but Ms. Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta stories have become bitter and depressing. The characters are unlikeable. It is a shame because Ms. Cornwell is a gifted writer and story teller."
2,Follow the bouncing ball,"I was once a huge fan of the Scarpetta books, until all of the main characters just became more and more unhappy. But this book has an even bigger problem. It bounces from one character to another, from place to place, back and forth, and is almost impossible to follow. And then the end is too simplistic and doesn't answer all of the questions raised.I'm really glad I borrowed the book from the library, in lieu of paying for it."
5,Thank you so much!,This book showed up quick and in great shape. Thank you so much for this great purchase!!!
3,The plot was a bit different but moved along quickly.,I thought this book was better than some of her others. Scarpetta didn't seem as annoying in this book. The plot was a bit different but moved along quickly.
1,Scarpetta crashes and burns,"I have read and mostly enjoyed every one of the previous Scarpetta books. Therefore, I was so disappointed in this muddled, disjointed disaster. It didn't even seem to be written by the same author. I doubt if I will waste my time and money on any future books. I feel like I have lost an old friend."
1,Scarpetta is Dead,"I give up. I'm glad I borrowed this book instead of wasting my money on this. I swore after Black Notice I wouldn't waste my hard earn money on another Scarpetta book. When I saw my friend cringing at the book, I asked to borrow it. Ms. Cornwell just let it go. It's shocking and stunning what has become of these characters"
1,definitely dismal,"I must agree with all the negative reviews given here. I received the book from a friend - we share books given the high prices these days. I must also state my resentment about being pulled into Lucy's alternate lifestyle. If I wanted to read about the lives of lesbians, there is plenty out there to choose from. They can live however they want, but that doesn't mean I want to read about it any more than they want to read about straights. So I put the book on the ""stinko"" shelf less than halfway through it. It will go the the library as a less than good donation."
1,This could be the last Cornwell book I'll ever read.,"This is one of the most depressing works of fiction that I have ever read. I can't believe how the characters I loved and the complicated stories I couldn't wait for from year to year have deteriorated so terribly. It was dark in the way a deserted coal mine on the darkest night of winter is dark. It is as sad and depressing as ... I can't even think of an image that is sad and depressing enough. I grieve for the Kay Scarpetta I knew and loved. I grieve for Lucy and Morino and even, to a small extent, Benton. If they were real people that I met somewhere, I'd make a point to avoid them in real life, which is what I will do to Cornwell's books until someone else who has read them tells me that the smart, savvy and entertaining characters I knew and loved are getting their lives and act together again."
1,Scarpetta getting stale or is it Patricia?,"Next time I may not even bother with Kay and the gang, but maybe I will - who knows? People are always drawn to a good car crash. I found this book to be first and foremost a difficult read. I have read every Scarpetta novel, I know the charachters and their histories, but I found this book hard to follow. Kay, Merino and Lucy were very unlikable - cold, even cruel. Benton, poor man, I to, would be confused by Kay.I know a mystery novel isn't supposed to give away all the clues too quickly, but this book was like a flea, jumping from subject to subject, hardly completing a sentence, much less a thought.Mostly, I was again disapponted by the very rushed, not completely explained, ending. But this is Miss Cornwell biggest fault, and I think it is just getting worse with time. I don't know about anyone else, but after I invest the time to read a book, I would like a nice fact filled, satisfying ending - doesn't have to be happy - just without questions."
2,Time Wasted,"I had read most of the reviews here before tackling Predator. It was given to me as a gift so Ireally had no choice but to read it. Now, I can tell you that the reviewers were right; don't waste your time. This is no longer Patricia Cornwell writing...at least it's not the old Patricia Cornwell I was devoted to. I don't know what's happened in her last several books, but other than those that might be given to me, I won't waste time or money on another Cornwell novel. This was the worst one yet. I did try a book that was suggested by someone writing a review on Predator. The book is called Thirst and the person knew what they were talking about. It is a gripping book that I read in two nights...didn't want to put it down once I started it, ans it didn't disappoint. The only way to describe the ending is to say, ""wow."""
1,So Disappointed,I'm almost embarrassed to admit...but I read several of the reviews and STILL read the darn book. I've been a fan of Cornwell for so long and have enjoyed just about every book. The last 1 or 2 have slipped a little but this one was a real disappoinment. The story was very hard to follow and even the writing was confusing and didn't flow at all. I found myself wondering if she had even written this book...it's really different from her usual style. I just don't get it...I hope you or your publisher at least read the reviews and give us something we can brag about next time. We just want Cornwell back!!
1,Save your money!,"I should have listened to the other reviewers--this book is horrible! While the author has written great reads in the past, she seems to have forgotten that, even in this series, people need at least one person they can like--the characters are so awful--as twisted as the people they are supposed to catch, that reading it is totally unsatisfying--it's more fun to root for the ""bad"" guys than Scarpetta, Marino, Lucy, etc, although, in this case, it's more fun just not to read the book at all! As if that wasn't enough, it was ridiculously hard to follow--it skipped around so much you couldn't figure who was supposed to be where, doing what, with whom! Save your money and try a new author--Cornwell is past her prime with this series!"
1,Predator,I was very disappointed in this book. I hadn't read a Kay Scarpetta mystery in along time. I was looking forward to a good mystery. Instead I found this book confusing. I would not recommend this book.
1,Please,"These books just must write themselves. Uuumm...let's see...Marino is still angry and in love with Kay, Benton and Scarpetta are still workaholics and Lucy, the stone butch niece, is still having shame-filled, debasing sexual encounters with psycho-serial killers. I'm thinking Cornwell ought to title her next one, ""Self-loathing."""
2,Predator,"I have been a fan of Patricia Cornwall's books. ""Predator"" was a disapointment. The characters with whom I have become acquainted, and enjoyed just didn't appear present in this novel. I kept turning back through the text trying to find answers to many unanswered questions. The plot was more like reading a Dean Koontz novel, in fact, I turned to the book jacket to make sure it was Patricia Cornwall that I was actually reading. Her earlier books were spellbinding, this novel, just not enjoyable, not engaging and not worth my reading time."
2,What hs happened to this series?,"I apologize in advance for writing a review when I am not quite done with the book, but I already know several things. I am OVER this series. I have seen these characters through the worst times and now am over the not-so-subtle downward spiral of their humanity. Moreno has become almost like a zombie, a Harley-loving one at that. Lucy, is bewitched by the bewitching and flows among her demons to a tiresome fault. Scarpetta has become unattractive in attitude and thought, rigid and unrelenting, clearly unfeminine. Benton, unknowable as always. Who needs this? Move on!!!!!!"
1,Leaves the reader unsatisfied,"I have read all of the Kay Scarpetta series and have really enjoyed most of them (the earlier ones more than the newer ones). I don't understand Cornwell's direction with Predator. It was too choppy and once it got to the solving of the ""mysteries"", it was very unsatisfying. Especially the ending. I wondered if I was missing a chapter!I miss the old Kay and I don't like the new Marino at all. Lucy seems to be too complicated and the Kay/Benton relationship is wierd. They seem to have unreal relationship issues when it comes to being mad and breaking up. I really preferred the more realistic times with Kay as the coroner, Marino as the detective, and Lucy and Benton with the FBI. This new academy is a stretch for these characters.Maybe this is a way for the author to ""write off"" a series and move on."
2,What is this?,Having read all of the Kay Scarpetts series I have found it has really gone down hill. Cornwells last book was a slight recovery from a long downhill slide so I had high hopes for this one. Although all of the main characters are becoming so disfunctional that I am losing any interest I had in them the book is fairly good until the end when it totally falls apart. It seems as though Cornwell ran out of time and had to write a quick ending. The only way this ending can be saved is if there is a sequel which goes back and explains in more detail what happened and continues from there.
2,Disappointed again.,"I use to wait anxiously for the Kay Scarpetta books to come out but have noticed the last couple haven't been up to par. I was really disappointed in the ending of this one. It was so vague that if you weren't familiar with the author's style, you would not have gotten the ending. And it seems like the relationship between Kay and Lucy never changes. It really needs to go somewhere so we're not reading the same lines in every book. Hopefully if there is a next Scarpetta book, we'll see some much needed changes."
1,Not worth reading,I've never read Patricia Cornwell and received this as a gift. I couldn't even finish it. It seems there is no suspense and no real story that is easy to follow. I almost forget that there is supposed to be an investigation. I kept finding myself bored and struggling to get to the next page. Perhaps I will try one of her earlier books.
1,The real Cornwell must have died some time back !!,"Oh where has the old Cornwell gone. Man, did I love her books. The cover on this book sounded like the old Cornwell had returned but this is just another in a string of disappointments. This book is horrible - it jumps all over the place - it's more about people that really seem to not get along and don't know what their life is all about. Cornwell tries to mix in some of her old style but it just gets lost. It seems like her attempts are like the movies when they throw in nude scenes - just tryin to give you a little thrill.I'm done buying her books. I miss the old Partricia Cornwell."
2,Going Downhill,"Patricia Cornwell's ""Scarpetta"" series keeps going downhill. It took me weeks to finish ""Predator"" because I kept dozing off when trying to read this boring book. Cornwell's early novels stuck with medical facts and interesting pathological details. Now she seems to be relying more on psychobabble and pseudoscience in her books. The characters are less and less believeable and she also appears to be trying to become more politically correct. I was able to finish this book, so I rated it two stars. However, if you want to read ""Predator"", I would recommend borrowing it or checking it out from the library. Spend your money on something else."
1,Very confusing and boring,"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books, but they are getting worse and worse. This will probably be the last book of hers that I will read. It was the worst one yet. I have just given up on believing her books will get better again. This one was too technical and kept going from one place to another and was very confusing to me. I really used to like her books, but I guess she has used up all her good ideas and now is just writing anything just to have a book to sell."
1,Missed Cornwell's name in the obit column,"Who or how many different people wrote Predator? It surely wasn't Cornwell. If this had been her first Scarpetta novel, she would have had to self-publish it because no major house or distributor would have carried it. Her novels have become increasingly bad; this one is definitely recycle material. Terrible writing, no pace, disconnected story line, dis- and unconnected characters (comic book type) who are unrecognizable from Cornwell's earlier works including Scarpetta. This book is a sick scheme to bilk money from a previously loyal following. Well, that's it, I'm done with Cornwell. Can't wait for the next Kathy Reich's novel; now that lady can still write good forensic/psycho thrillers. Bye bye, Cornwell; you'll not fool me anymore."
1,Amazingly Awful,"I'd seen Cornwell's books around and when a friend gave me this one, I tried reading it. Tried is the operative word. It was miserable, a mishmash of characters, plotlines and words. With nothing connecting, I put it down after several chapters and do not intend to read anything by Cornwell again."
1,Predator by Patricia Cornwell,"This was the worst. Not only are the characters more and more unlikable and even disgusting, the story was not there, either. I wish Ms. Cornwell would drop this whole Lucy character, the Acadamy (too outlandish) and her relationship with the rest of her recurring characters. I really do not need to spend my time reading this trash. I used to be a big fan."
1,why is cornwell still trying?,"i swore to myself that after the misery of ""Trace"" that i would not read another cornwell book with kay scarpetta as the leading character. i have been a faithful reader of the scarpetta series from the begining, but there are only so many times you can believe someone forged their way into a top secret facility, dug deeper into their self destructive ways, broke up/fell i love with the same character, and ran into ANOTHER serial killer with police connections. i've said it before and i'll say it again, cornwell should have bowed scarpetta out gracefully with ""The Last Precinct"" and let her rest in peace. this book is just another bad last ditch effort. of you are dead seat on reading this self loathing novel, get it for free at your local library. don't waste your money on the disappointment."
1,Demise of a good writer,"Not only was this book the worst that Patricia Cornwell has written, it was BAD by any standard. I don't believe I'll ever again pay full price for anything she writes. This book was a mess. The plot wandered, the characters were unappealing, and the only reason I finished it was because it is set, primarily, in my hometown of Hollywood, Florida, and I know a number of people who actually work in the Medical Examiner's Office. Turns out, that wasn't reason enough to have wasted my time. What a disappointment. I don't know what has happened to Cornwell to turn her writing so sour, but I hope she recovers."
1,goodbye Kay,"After several years, I have finally given up on hoping that Cornwell will get the Scarpetta series back on track. While slightly better than the last novel, it was still a sad reminder of how much this series has derailed itself."
4,A FINE MACHINE,This a fine quality machine. It really is very basic and quite simple in its design. Although not as refined as some sanders out there this unit does one thing well. SAND.The ability to adjust the speed is a must on any sander.This tool will easily withstand the daily rigors of loading and unloading your work truck.I do recommend upgrading the sanding shoe and I wish porter cable offered that as a standard.From the rugged american craftsmanship to its simplicity and fair price this tool is a big hit.Two thumbs up on this one.Now get out there and sand something.
5,A mystic musician who lives her spirituality,"Listening to any of Therese's works invites us to leave the busy world for a moment, not to escape, but to focus on the greater truths of peace, hope and charitable service to others. All of her recordings are true spiritual medicine, and are in such need in today's world.I've been a fan of Ms. Sheker since the mid 1980's, and she has followed me on many of life's journeys. This music is greatly needed. Bless you, Therese!"
5,Angelic,Therese's voice has a rare purity and healing quality and this cd always lifts my mood. It is certainly worth owning.
3,Poor Business Sense,"Offering the entire album at the same cost as individual tracks ($0.99/track) is an odd marketing choice. The Rolling Stones' Hot Rocks, for example, is discounted $1.83 from the cost of its 21 individual tracks."
2,Poor Quality Rice Cooker,"This rice cooker failed after just a few months. It made great rice for a time and then suddenly, in the middle of the cook cycle one day, I smelled an electrical burning smell and the rice cooker quit working. As I have checked other Black and Decker rice cooker reviews, I see this is a common problem.I fought with customer service of Applica (the company that makes BandD small appliances) for several months. But finally they gave me a different replacement rice cooker."
4,Everyday rice cooker for a reasonable price from B&D,"Nice rice cooker for the price. I bought it from WM on rollback for under $18. I have used this model b4, and its very durable for the price."
5,Nice rice cooker,"I purchased this electric rice cooker to replace the microwave model that I currently own. The electric model is very nice since it frees up the microwave, and takes up very little space on the countertop. All that needs to be done is to measure the rice and water, add any flavorings you wish, plug it in and in about 30 minutes, it's ready!"
5,Makes rice cooking foolproof!,"I love to make stir-fry but cooking the rice was always a pain. I prefer using the healthier brown rice which is even harder to cook. After some debate I finally decided to try one of these and I wish I'd had made the decision a long time ago! Just measure your rice using the included measure and add water to the line. Add any desired seasonings and press ""Cook"". When the cooking is finished it automatically switches to ""Warm"" to keep your rice warm as long as desired. Perfect fluffy rice everytime without timing or watching. Well worth the modest price. The only thing I might change is perhaps a bell to let you know when it's done."
1,Great...until it stops working,"Owned two of this model in the last 18 months. Used about once per week. In both cases during mid-cook, cooker started to have a burnt electrical smell then the cooker stopped working."
3,A decent rice cooker but...,"I think there are 2 issues with this one:1. The non-stick container is not really non-stick.. Everytime i cook rice, the bottom portion is mildly stuck, it turns out a little burnt (light brown) and is stuck2. The device doesn't have anti-slip legs.. if you put this on a polished surface, you can possibly shift its location with a big blow of air. This is inconvenient when you keep the cooker on a kitchen platform and even try to dig rice out of it, u have to hold the cooker so it doesnt move.Other than that, its a good rice cooker for the price. Rice cooks fine in the given estimated time with the amount of water levels they suggested in the manual."
5,hummingbird feeder,Great product. Constantly have several birds at a time at the opus mobile I use these on.
2,Not for a hot climate,"I bought this feeder to try because I was having trouble with finches at my hummingbird feeders. I live in the deep South where it is pretty hot during hummingbird season. The instructions that came with the feeder have a Special Note that states ""Direct sunlight may cause pressure to build up inside the nectar container, forcing nectar out of the feeding ports. If you notice nectar seeping out, move the feeder into a shaded or semi-shaded location."" Not only direct sunlight, but also just high Southern heat can cause the nectar to seep. I have the feeder in the shade but the nectar still seeps and I have not seen a hummingbird at this feeder. I plan to take this feeder to Michigan where my mother has active hummers and will see if the design works better there. Since nectar seepage in the heat must be an ongoing issue or there would not have been a Special Note at the end of the instructions, I think that information should be prominently included in the product description."
3,humming bird feeder,The Garden Jewels Hummingbird Feeder is pretty but MUCH smaller than anticipated. I have never seen a bird feeding (though they go to the larger glass feeders we have). Not sure why.
1,major design flaw,I purchased this model last summer. The plastic hook broke off very soon after it was hung. It appears to have been simply glued onto the top of the feeder. I have made several unsuccessful attempts to to reattach the hook. The feeder is now useless.
1,It's a total drip,"I have a birding/nature store and thought this would be a great feeder to keep birds other than hummingbirds from guzzling the nectar. Every one I sold was returned because they drip terribly. When I tried it myself, I had the same experience and on top of that the hummingbirds didn't use it. I had a huge sticky wet mess underneath the feeder and just gave up on it and have quit selling it. I see that other reviewers have had better luck and maybe theirs didn't drip, but living in New Mexico with the hot summer sun, I wouldn't recommend it because of the drip factor. There are far better feeders than this one."
3,"SEEMS LIKE AN EPIDEMIC OF BROKEN FEDING GLOBES, HUH?","Yup, mine broke away too. Only I wasn't as lucky as the good rabbi; mine were over a deck and ka-blooey; glass everywhere. To replace the three fractured globes, $5.99 each ? Eighteen bucks? A whole new system is $19-ish. Maybe that's where these folks make their real money, huh?(Okay, hang over soft terra and be really,really thorough in hooking the fragile balls.Nice disign for sure, and the rest of the system is well made."
4,opus 447 - need new feeding port,"about 5 years ago i purchased a opus 447 feeder and have had good success with getting hummingbirds to feed from it. I also had a plastic feeder ( rubbermaid) the hummers preferred the opus feeder over the rubbermaid. I did have to replace the hanger, as it broke. Also, this spring as i was getting ready to hang the opus feeder, i dropped it on my deck and the plastic feeding port broke in half. the glass did not break. is it possible to get a replacement?"
3,Hummingbird feeder,I would rate these great EXCEPT that the hummingbirds don't like them. We've had them several weeks and only one of our hummingbirds will eat from them. We tried everything the brochure suggested.
2,Too Small,"It's hard to unscrew bottom to fill, plus if you have alot of hummingbirds, this is not the right feeder for you."
4,Thank heaven - the hook has been redesigned!!!,"Ordered this in spite of reviews that the hook breaks easily. Liked the price ($5.99) and wanted to try a hummingbird feeder in my yard. Happy to inform all that the hook has now been redesigned! It has a metal piece which makes it easy to handle rather than the older glass one. Order without compuncation - this one is a winner. (And you can mix your own sugar water - 4/1 ratio, add red food color) - no need to order the expensive stuff."
1,Garden Jewels Hummingbird feeder,My hummingbirds have ignored this feeder for some reason. They prefer my window feeders to this one. I'm sorry I purchased this feeder.
3,It's Just OK,"The feeder pictured is not the feeder I received. The base is plastic, not glass, and the glass globe top is clear, not red. The positives are that Hummers are attracted to it and it functions fine. The negatives are that it is hard to clean and looks cheap. Think disposable.If you're looking for a good quality feeder that will hold up for a few years, check this one out:Best-1 32 Ounce Hummingbird Feeder. We have three that have been in use every summer since 2003."
2,Attractive To Look At,We were given this item as a gift and it is a beautiful feeder. We think the glass globes are too heavy for the construction of the mobile. If they could be replaced with plastic it would be much safer and perform better. I gave it 2 stars for appearance only. We filled it once and we were too afraid to keep it up because of the weight of the globes.
2,Short lived.,"This product was a disapointment.The item appears to be a good stable feeder.But, the feeder did not even survive one season.The attachment between the bulb and the hanger is unstable. This resulted in the total distruction of this product before the season was over. The new Opus design does not allow the ring to pass through the glass. The result is a split ring. The material the ring is made of is to soft (ie aluminum.) The ring lacks durability, and allows the bulb to fall unexpectedly.I liked the thickness of the new ring, it just needs to pass through the glass."
4,Hummingbirds like it,"I bought this when the woodpeckers decided this year to dominate my other hummingbird feeders. The hummers took to it right away, and didn't have any trouble figuring out how to use it. The picture is a little misleading- the only part that is red is the bottom part. The top, where you fill the nectar is actually clear. It is easy to clean. The only concern I have is the seemingly cheap make of the red bottom part. I hope it doesn't crack after a few uses."
2,"Beautiful, impractical","Was not expecting the feeder to be so small -- my error. Should have realized that 10 ounces would hardly last one day. Also, as one reviewer mentioned, it does not look like the picture advertising the feeder. Such errors of misinformation, while I'm sure not intentional, should be corrected...........agw"
3,OPUS 447 Garden Song 10-Ounce Glass Hummingbird Feeder,I have enjoyed using this Hummingbird Feeder but find it difficult to keep cleaned. But the size if perfect for hummingbirds and works well in my yard.
1,The birds looked,"After having two of the Garden Jewels feeder up for three day and only having Humming Birds look at it I filled and hung my trusty old one quart plastic feeder. The birds emptied the plastic feeder in about a week, they didn't even go to the Garden Jewels feeder when the plastic feeder was empty.I gave it one star for for being CUTE, it doesn't attract bees and you can't give zero starsMay 30 edit,A bear just broke my plastic feeder but did not touch these feeders.So, it does attract humming Birds, Bees or even Bears"
2,Satisfied but not pleased,"I was sent three fluted, clear-glass hummingbird feeders, not what I had ordered but not worth the trouble of returning the product for the red glass."
2,Plastic Base,"Did it say that in the description? I don't know. Maybe it's necessary, but I've seen many that are all glass and very lovely. This is fine, but not as pretty as it looks here."
2,Item Not As Pictured,"Item is not as pictured. Item is clear glass on top, not a smooth glass globe, it has molded ""segments"" around the globe. Bottom cap is red plastic. This is fine except that I was looking to replace the identical item pictured for an existing hanging feeder that holds 3 globes. This feeder works fine, but I was disappointed that it was not the one in the photo, so it does not match the system."

This is fine except that I was looking to replace the identical item pictured for an existing hanging feeder that holds 3 globes. This feeder works fine, but I was disappointed that it was not the one in the photo, so it does not match the system.The MOST disappointing thing is that I later ordered a similar feeder from Amazon for $5.99. I was going to see which one worked better for my system. I received the same exact feeder as this one! It was also not as pictured. So, there are 2 feeders for sale on Amazon, both advertised as completely different feeders, one priced at twice the amount as the other. I paid $5.99 for one, and $13.99 for the other. When I received the 2 feeders, they were EXACTLY the same item. And neither of these feeders are the one in the photos."
4,Fantastic value,"I was skeptical at first because of the low price, but I am very pleasantly surprised by what a decent lens this is. It's sharp, has good range, and even in low light, still does well on my Pentax K200D.I've noticed difficulty focusing at its maximum focal distance. I haven't had a chance to play around with it to see what's going on. Also note that the minimum focusing distance is 5 ft, so if you're buying it for macro work, keep that in mind. If you're looking for a low-cost telephoto lens, this one can't be beat at this price."
5,EXCELLENT ITEM,"An excellent item, it function really good and fits pretty well to my canon eos 350D."
5,great,works just what they say it will.. good construction and materials works just what they say it will.. good construction and materials
4,Awesome so far!,"I've been able to capture some nice shots with this lens on my K-5 II. It can be pretty sharp at 5.6 and 8. I have mainly shot in daylight so can't tell how well it will fare at night. I got this used for about half price, definitely worth the full price of a new one that's for sure. This is a good budget zoom that will give you decent shots with a good telephoto range.It does get a little shaky at 300mm if you are just shooting free-handed, but the K-5 II has in body stabilization so it helps a good bit."
4,Amazing lens for such a price,I bought this for my pentax and checked it in couple of modes but not yet completely. based on my opinion i gave it a 4 star since it is similiar to the one that my friend uses with his Nikon...however the fading around the corners while in zoom and macro modes are some meager issues to consider but i find this lens amazing for the price. will take more pictures to test the build and write in forums soon.hope this helps
4,Good lens for the price,"A good lens for the price. Switching between telephoto to Macro is a bit of a pain, because a manual switch is needed and only can be done after you bring it into focus. But for budget minded users, it's hard to find a better deal and quality."
4,Sigma 70-300 Lens for Pentax SLRs,"On a digital SLR, the Sigma 70-300 Lens provides good range for taking pictures for wild life and other distant objects. Based on my experience, the lens produces good focus and good photos, especially for the purchase price."
3,"For the wrong thing, it was great!","I received the Sigma lens from 47th Street Photo in great condition. The design was exactly what I was looking for, but upon delivery I noticed the lens would not fit my Samsung NX100. Product description wasn't clear. My camera was in the shop and 47th Street wouldn't accept a return until I had tried to fit it to my camera."
2,SLOW AND STICKY,"Didn't spend much time working with this lens, was very disappointed in the product. The auto focus was slow and loud. When using manual focus, found the focus ring to be tight and sticky. I was unable to focus and maintain any steadiness, with the effort needed to move the focus ring. Knew I would only get frustrated by this lens and returned it immediately."
4,Great for the money!,Have used the lens several times now taking pictures of Cross Country raises. It is easy to use and works very well on my Sony Camera. The pictures are excellent also.
3,Great lens but no AutoFocus,"We have used the lens and it takes great pictures. However, we were disappointed that this was not an Autofocus lens. The instructions and the box clearly show AF/MF but the lens is clearly MF only."
2,Not for me!,"I had read many 'glowing' reviews re: this lens...so I ordered it. I even ck'd out some photos people had sent in, esp the sports photos. I couldn't believe the clarity! HOWEVER THIS WAS NOT MY EXPERIENCE. Firstly, no one person mention they ever used a tripod for the longer length. Some even mentioned the camera was 'handheld'. Well I found I could not take NOT ONE decent shot over 200 mm and not have it out of focus. Certainly setting up a tripod each time is not practical unless you're into nature photography. Thats why the pictures of sports interested me. So I sent it back and determined to stick w/ a max of 200 focal length. Seriously considering Sigma 18-200 but would like to come down in price. I applaud those that took shots at 250-300 mm but apparently thats not for me.Well constructed. Sorry it didn't work out for my Canon 350D. Nice macro."
3,Sigma Lens,"Have had to have it repaired, not sure why, wish we would have checked Consumer reports on this item, we may have made a different choice of a lens."
4,Great price,We got a great price on this lens. The only thing that it doesn't do is auto focus which we thought it did when we purchased the lens. I would recommend this lens!
3,misleading.,"It says it works for Samsung NX cameras, but the product I received did not. I cannot comment on it's performance as I could not use it. The retailer was very understanding and gave me a refund, so A+ on customer service :)"
4,Nice lens,"I am not a photog so I can't really give an opinion on the pros and cons versus a comparable lens. I can tell you that it work great for some really long shots that I took while traveling. It shouldn't be the only lens in your kit, but its works well for its intended purpose."
2,Fair at best,"Ok lens if you're a beginner on a very tight budget. It's very noisy and the autofocus is poor, even in good light. The lack of an image stabilizer means that, unless you have surgeon-like hands, you will probably need a tripod to get a clear shot when fully zoomed in. And you can pretty much forget about action shots.That said, it's probably the least expensive lens of this type you can get and it's more versatile than a point-and-shoot. If you're brand new to SLR photography it's a good tool to experiment with. If you're a bit more seasoned, save up and buy something better."
1,waste of money,"This lens is garbage. Unbelievably slow, af is trash. Could not get any halfway decent shots with this thing. Dont waste your time"
1,Uncooperative dealer,"When the item arrived, we needed to exchange it. We could not get the dealer even to acknowledge us. He would not call, he would not email. It was a very frustration experience which had to be taken to Amazon for resolution."
3,awesome lens for the price,"Great lens for the price. I love the macro option. Auto focus is nice and fast. All in all, I am very happy with it.update: 3-11-11 - I've been using this lens on a regular basis. I use it both in manual and AF mode. It's been almost 2 months and I noticed the lens creep in the past 2 weeks. I still love using the lens, but maybe a lock option would be nice."
5,Very long lens,"This lens is amazing. The autofocus is faster than my 18-55 kit lens that came with my camera. This lens will work on the D5100. Autofocus works fine on the D5100 so don't worry if you have this kind of camera. If you zoom past 200mm and click the macro switch on, the focusing goes out even more. You just have to put the focus past where the little N> is to be able to get it back to normal mode. Great lens. This lens extends to about 8 inches long fully extended.My lens came with a lens hood, 58mm filters (UV, CPL, and FD), a cap keeper, and a cleaning kit. None of which I ordered, but it was free so why not keep it?For the money, definitely worth it. You need to use a tripod or at least a monopod with this lens unless you have the hands of a sniper to keep this thing still enough. BUY THIS LENS BEFORE THE PRICE CHANGES."
4,More to come,"Bought this lens to go with my new Samsung GX-10. Haven't used it much, but have used it enough to know it's a great lens for the money. Images are clear at all focal lengths, very little vignetting that can be easily corrected. Good build quality. You can't go wrong with this one."
3,"Better to name as ""Macro Lens""","I bought this lens with the hope of having a budget telephoto lens for my Nikon D100. The point is I bought a wrong lens, since it is not an ""OS""(Optical Stabilizer) Sigma lens where it is a real pain to have shake-free images in high focal lenghts especially in low light conditions (ofcourse without using a tripod).Macro performance is good but min focusing distance of 95mm may become a problem."
3,Might get wrong lens,"Just a heads up that I ordered this item, and the one I got didn't match the picture and wasn't compatible with my Samsung NX200. I'm not sure whether there is a compatible version out there, but it isn't this one."
3,Need to switch to manual focus at higher zooms,Autofocus does not work at higher zoom. Have to switch to manual focus. Havent used the macro mode much. Otherwise the results are OK.
3,Ok lens,"1-Autofocus is slow2-No image stabilization3-Noisy/shaky as hell and not sharp (Even on a tripod with 100 ISO at f/11 with timer/remote)photos still don't look that good! At least moon shots...4-Takes forever to get a macro shot in focus and it's completely impossible to use it without a tripod!5-I haven't used it in safaris or for insects' macros but I bet that it's impossible to do that since it takes a really long time to focus and get a non-shaky shot6-Even in extreme sunlight and at 1/1000s or 1/2000s photos are still shaky at 200-300mm7-Color fringing (Chromatic Aberration)In short words... Useless indoors, Useless without a tripod, Impossible to use at night, Good for slower exposuresThe lens maybe considered cheap to other lenses BUT I kinda regret buying it... I should've saved the $170 for something else!"
4,very pleased,"I purchased this lens for my pentax k100d. I was very pleased with the build quality and overall feel of the lens. Good contrast. Good fit and finish. I will be using this lens in harsh environments like camping fishing hiking settings. The price is right, and I won't be overly concerned with using it in those environments. I've been impressed with the images I've taken in normal outdoor dalylight. Probably not the best choice for inside / questionable light."
3,Wish I'd known the gears would strip so easily.,"I was looking for an inexpensive 70-300mm lens for my Sony a330 - at first, this seemed brilliant. The picture quality was fantastic right off the bat. Then, only two weeks into owning it, it began to shudder and make a terrible noise upon turning on and turning off. It took only one quick web search to find that this is a known problem with Sigma lenses (or at least this particular lens) - the AF gears get stripped on by newer model cameras (or something to that effect.) For now, my lens is still taking decent pictures, though it shudders and makes that terrible noise (horrible for quiet settings, while trying to be stealthy in shooting.) I'm afraid it is going to outright fail very soon though."
4,Decent balance of quality for the money.,"First: You get what you pay for. The ""feel"" of this lens isn't ""Nikon"" in any way, so you should not complain about that part of the Sigma experience.Finally: If you need an longer reach on occasion and do not want to spend hundreds of dollars to have the right tool available in your bag, this lens does the job.I used this glass at an indoor arena over the weekend and was able to zoom in on the center field as needed, and came out with some nice images."
4,Sigma 70-300 Telephoto Zoom Lens,Very good lens for the money. Switching to Macro and back at times is difficult. Quality and construction is good.
3,Value Purchase,Good value for the price. Functions very well. Pictures are sharp when the light is sufficient. Macro feature works well.
1,Trust the one starred reviews,"This lens is garbage.Chromatic aberration & blurring... yes it's bad enough, this is the lens made from your nightmares, do not waste your time looking at this brand ever again.This isn't the one defective lens that escaped assembly, this is yet another once good company that now manufactures and sells low quality to the unsuspecting/trusting customer because the profit is good enough and it can squeeze by enough people who take too long to notice the problem.Don't do it, avoid Sigma at any costIt doesn't matter how much you're not into photography and won't mind, this is simply unacceptable.I wish I could properly express my depth of disappointment in Sigma."
1,You get what you pay for I guess...,"I haven't had a lot of luck with good pics as of yet. Still playing with it though. I think it is odd that the lens when not attached/or attached - the shutter stays wide open, never seen this before. Either way, will check back in as I play with it more."
3,Not their most inspired effort,"I love the Femmes and consider them to be one of the best live bands I've seen (Viva Wisconsin is a must buy). However, this album doesn't have any really standout songs, nor does it signal any new directions. It is a basic straightforward Femmes' sound. Don't get me wrong, it's good. But if you are not a Femmes fan, you are better off with Viva Wisconsin."
3,"Close, but not quite...","Unmistakably VF but whether or not classic or pure VF will depend on each fan's perspective. This is much better than New Times but falls short of the wonderful Why Do Birds Sing and all their earlier great albums. Overall, Freak Magnet is harder edged and brasher in sound. Bottom line for me is this is an average album by a superior band that with a little extra TLC could have delivered a great album. I'm a bit disappointed but glad I bought it."
4,The Violent Femmes still rock..,"Okay so I bought this cd for 3 bucks. I'd have to say it was the best 3 dollars Ive ever spent! This is an awesome cd, sadly it is very underated. Their older stuff is still better, but thats a given. I do have beef with the VFs, whats up with them doing Sponge Bob Square Pants theme song? Hmm, I dont know. If you like acoustic/folk/punk then get this album, you wont be dissapointed."
1,Re-issue Rip-off!,"I'm so sick of new labels buying up old label scraps, and issuing a ""re-issue"" to try and make money. Screw this new label, and this ""re-issue"" with one bonus track. Tell record companies you're sick of this. Let them reissue an album as is, and make a whole new bonus tracks EP. You want to know why the music audience is stealing tunes off the internet? Because you record labels are pulling lame-o tactics like this. You deserve to go under!!!!!"
2,A little weak.,"If you really are going to drill alot of 1/2 holes and larger get a drill with more amperage. This drill looks like the big ones, but it's a pussy cat."
5,First Rate Guide,"This is a first rate book from O'Reilly. Plenty of depth, to the point that there will be little need to buy any other book on the subject. Here you will learn all about the physical layer, the 802.11 protocol, and plenty of information on the alphabet soup that surrounds it.The guide is readable and logically laid out. It will make a great reference work but can be read through as a single whole too.However as a caution, like all technology guides, 802.11 protocols have moved on since i read this. Check when the current edition was revised before buying this."
4,great book,Very good book lots of details on every wireless standard. I would recommend this book to anybody who wants to learn wireless networking.
4,Good overview,"This is a great book to get started with 802.11 wireless networks. It gives a great overview and a decent amount of detail. For more detail I used open source available on the web, Linux drivers, and a book on 802.11i for more in depth knowledge on security."
2,"Outdated and by default, Useless.","This book wouls be great if it was the year 2000 or something. It's outdated and therefor not a decent guide to implement any kind of .11 network unless you don't mind it being completely unsecured.Get a sample chapter here and you be the judge:...Save Time and money by getting Syngress ""Building a Cisco Wireless Network"" or any other Syngress wireless book for that matter. They offer a 1 Year Buyer protection Plan that lets you get updates for your book if the technology changes within 12 months of your books purchase...very useful.I manage a multi-level wireless outfit for a company in Seattle and have been testing 11a and 11b for almost a year now. This book is barely worth reading, unless it was free!=)kevin"
1,\_/\_/,"The books in not very complete in what it teaches you. It is fine for beginners, but does not meet the needs of advanced users."
2,And I thought i was already confused,"Maybe I am not smart enough for this book, it certainly isn't for the novice!!I ended up more confused than educated!"
3,Pink Headset,"I really like the Motorola H500 pink Bluetooth headset. Works well,great price,although I bought 3 for my girls and one of the headsets would not take a charge and had to get it replaced. The only feature that I was disappointed about was the earpiece is not adjustable to different size ears. It feels rather big like it's going to fall off. It would be nice to come up with some sort of attachment that could make it a tighter fit. The clarity in the sound is great and is very user friendly."
1,Didn't send what was advertised,I ordered the headset that included the case. I only received the headset and the vendor wouldn't send me the case. Fortunately Amazon stood behind me and took care of this situation. Amazone is very fair with the customer when the vendor doesn't send what they advertise in their offering.
3,Got headset but no case!,"Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset with Case - PinkGot the headset with accessories but there was NO CASE.The gadget works great though -great reception, clarity and not having to get any of those tiny batteries every week is a big plus."
2,Motorola H500 is very annoying,The Motorola H500 Bluetooth (BT) turns off/on with a button. Many times when I have stored it in my purse it would accidently turn on by being pressed against something. When I tried to use my phone to make a call(not knowing the BT was on) I couldn't get it to work (or so I thought). It was working but through the BT inside my purse.I much prefer a style like the Motorola HS850 that features a foldable boom microphone that turns the BT on/off. I went back to this type and put the H500 in a drawer.
1,Disapointed,"I have other products by Porter Cable and I have always assumed they are Quality products. My saw was 14 months old but had less then 5 hours when the trigger switch failed. returned to an authorized center for repair at a cost of $60.00. Three weeks later saw failed again, returned to authorized center and was informed the armature was bad and to replace was $100.00 for parts and &50.00 for labor.That is when I decided I will buy a Dewalt to replace it."
4,This Saw Can Take It - And Dish It Out,"I've had this saw for about a year now, and it can definitely handle the work. Let me start by saying that I've never been a huge Porter Cable fan. Their tools are always tough enough, but usually lack the smaller ""finesse"" design features that some of the other brands seem to have. In other words, a perfect choice for a recip. saw. The blade change collar works great - a HUGE improvement over my old Milwaukee with the hex key. This saw powers through wood, nails, pipe without complaint. My only complaint is minor. The blade compartment in the plastic case doesn't hold long blades. How hard is it to mold a plastic case that can handle common parts? Overall, a great value for a saw with this much power."
5,"A powerful beast, esp. for the price!",This is my first recip saw (used weak ones before) & only regret not buying this sooner. Bought it to demolish my 20-year old 3-tier deck (replacing planking). Can't believe how fast this baby chews through the old 2x6 planks... It's almost as easy as drawing a line with chalk. Cut through some joist hangers in about 1 sec/per. Highly recommended.
5,Serger DVD +,"Just as good as the first DVD...helped me to expand what I do with my serger. Again, I love that I can go back and watch a section over in order to understand the mechanics of the steps."
1,Poor Quality,"The hook and loop part came off of the backing the first day I used it. I did use it a lot, but should last more than one day. This is the name brand product. The glue isn't strong enough."
2,Rambling dissapointment,The book rambles on with no seeming focus. It does contain some interesting thoughts but to get to them you must wade through a terrible book.
5,Love this,Who would believe a few herbs into a salve would soothe and heal just about any skin issue but it does.
1,"Sadly, it had no effect.","Maybe this product worked for others but it did nothing to help with my Shingles rashes. However, it makes for quite a nice cuticle cream and it was not expensive."
3,somewhat helpful,The cream remains creasy on the skin...I have breakouts of dry skin periodically. I used this salve on my skin and it seemed to soothe the breakout. However it remained on the top of my skin and creasy. I will continue to use when I have a breakout...to see if it really is effective.
1,Buyer Beware,"The ""Format"" information in the ""Product Details"" section for ""Bite the Bullet"" says that a widescreen presentation is included on the DVD. However, the back of the DVD cover insert only indicates a ""Full Screen"" (i.e. ""Pan & Scan"") presentation."
3,"One Kicked the Bucket, One Won the Race, All Bit the Bullet","Good concept for a story, but somewhat shallow plot. I am a Ben Johnson fan. In my opinion, he did not have a big enuf part in this film. Ben was a tall man who spent his whole life on horseback and eventually walked as tho he had back problems and was in constant pain. His character,(a former pony express rider), also had back pain and he gets a linament rubdown from a compassionate compatriot. Loved seeing Ben's Hiney !! The horsemanship was wonderful all around. Who would believe Murphy Brown (Candace Bergen) was such a marvelous horsewoman. On and on they went. Don't even remember who won the race."
3,Hearts in the Right Place. Corny?.....So What?,"I want to see the knowhow of Hackman, the street smarts of Coburn and the earthy, toughness of Johnson.Want to see heros and nobility. Especially want to see Hackman giving his frothing horse water, instead of first riding over the finish line. I don't care about the corn. Made me feel good."
3,Candice Bergen is so charming,"OK plot but if you are a Candice Bergen fan like I am (from The Sand Pebbles to Murphy Brown), you will enjoy it."
2,Bite this!,"Ohhh the brutality, ohhhhh the dying breed, ohhhh the sense of loss, ohhhh the prejudice! Jeez, when are all the revisionists going to stop analyzing Westerns for crying out loud? S**t happens. If it offends your socially engineered sensibilities then go back to the comfort of your Meryl Streep collection.Boring, tedious, and very tiresome waste of celluloid-particularly in light of Coburn/Hackman/Bergen's presence. Nothing interesting or intriguing here, unless you are obsessed with 19th century desert dentisty. May have been a little better without the constant diversion of the out-of-place south of the border guy with the bad tooth. A monument to the stupid ultra-left creeping sensitivity of the 60/70's.Virtually impossible to sit through the entire film. I think I'd rather have my eyes stapled open for the entire Lucky Luke/Trinity series. 2 Horses-all deader'n hell."
4,Based on fact!,"This movie is based on a race from Chadron, NE to Chicago in 1893. Doc Middleton, a natorious criminal from the area is played by Gene Hackman. I believe there was a worlds fair in Chigago that year and Middleton wanted to get in good with Bill Cody and be in Cody's wild west show. Each enterant left Chadron with two horses. Cowboys of the west did not treat their horses as depicted in the movie. Horses were their life line. One of Middleton's horses became lame before Sioux City, IA and the other before he reached Illinois. He finished his trip to Chicago on a train. The total trip was about 1000 miles. Ah, how hollywood does rewrite history!"
5,They beat horses -don't they ?,"Distirbing movie about a horserace and how cruel and abusive some of the characters are or become. I saw this movie when I was 11 years old and have never forgotten it. Anyone who loves animals and horses will be deeply moved. The movie encompasses all the human vices with the sheer unconditional loyality of the horses that they harm or kill. The ""desert scene"" of the horse running to it's death still haunts me. I hate westerns and loved this movie. Unconfortable to watch for animal lovers but worth it."
1,"Poor quality, low volume, short life.","I bought this little portable speaker thinking it was rather low cost and convent, I was totally wrong.First, I had to buy 4 AAA batteries, which was a lot of power for such a tiny speaker. Then I found out that if I did not remove the batteries after each use they would leak acid.The volume was very low, even with my S9 (an audio player) volume turned up to max the volume was nominal at best. It almost felt like the speakers could not handle the load.That turned out to be real, one speaker died after a month, then the other. The plastic that the unit was made out of would break off into small pieces, it didn't last even 2 months.This is just not worth the money and is not convent in any way. I got an iLuv speaker case afterwards, which only needed 2 AA batteries and didn't leak, had much better sound and volume at the same cost and much happier with it."
4,Ipod portable speakers - my review,"I searched for quite a while both in stores and online for speakers to play my iPod in my vehicles that do not have USB or audio jacks. For the limited time I drive these vehicles, I did not want to invest in replacing the stereo's, but I needed something portable, and could be powered without the use of batteries. (note: you can use batteries with this model as well). I have a phone charger that has a built-in USB, and this speaker unit allows me to charge both my phone and listen to my iPod at the same time.I generally listen to audio books while I'm driving, and occassionally music. The quality of these is not for the music connoisseur, but if you are only listening to books, it is more than adequate. You must remember to turn off your iPod, as it does not automatically stop, as when using a built-in interface with your vehicle.I've had my speakers for about six months.So for the value, about $10.00, it more than fit my needs. I would buy one again."
1,Tiny cases with no meaning,"As a clinical psychologist who has studied with many of Erickson's pupils, I found this book virtually useless unless you've already read all of Erickson's cases and understand what he was up to. It is like a list of cases, simplified to the point of meaninglessness. Don't waste your money - although I'd like to sell you mine to get my money back.Dr. Doyle"
4,Sandpaper is fine. The sander is of limited value and poorly designed.,"I bought the sandpaper and it works well, however the sander itself is a waste of your money. Only the pad shaped like the sandpaper will stay on the sander. The profile pads fall out easily. The sander is poorly designed - shame on Porter Cable."
2,"Should have been called ""witches Inn""","I watched the Horror Hotel,but i didn't get a chance to watch the bat or the gorilla. All the movies are Black and White, but they have a very high dvd quality picture. There is a logo at the bottom right of the screen for about 5 minutes at the beginning and the movie wasn't very scary.It's still interesting to watch if you get it cheap."
3,Does NOT fit ALL Kettler slides,"We purchased this item because on several websites (Amazon included) the slide is/was advertised to attach to ALL Kettler slides. This in incorrect. This slide ONLY attaches to the Kettler Trimmstation. We were very pleased with Amazon's prompt and helpful response to have the item shipped back; however, we are sad that Kettler does not currently make a slide to fit the Swingset we purchased. We purchased the Deluxe 4 Child Swing, Glider and Gondola. All assembled VERY easily. While we did not assemble the slide, I would assume the assembly would be just as smooth based on the three other Kettler items I assembled."
5,Collector's Item,"THE LONG DAY OF JOSHUA AND SIX OTHER CATASTROPHES is a study in ancient history, Bibical exigesis, cosmology, geophysics, and solar system astrophysics.There are actually eight events considered:The Noachian FloodThe Tower of Babel CatstropheThe Sodom-Gomorrah CatstropheThe Exodus CatastropheThe Long Day of JoshuaThe Greater Davidic CatastropheThe Joel-Amos CatastropheThe Isaiahic CatastropheQuoting from the first chapter:The cause of the catastrophes was Mars -- Mars in another orbit, a Mars surrounded by orbiting meteoritic debris . . . .It gives excellent explanations that are very thought provoking.There are good citations for students of the subject."
3,Ancients books can bring new ideas...,The Earth-Mars resonance orbits and its implication in our calendar is interesting. I would recommend to people who wants to know why our one yer has 365.25... days - and round 360 days before ~700 BC
4,Quite Good,"We are using this for our 16 year old dog, Marcus, who is slowly losing the use of his back legs. Linoleum, by the way, is a hazard in trying to pick him, a big dog, up.The food is good, nutritious, and has helped slow down his mobility loss, yet he still has it in him to try and keep up with our 4 year old, and 1 year old dogs. And, he still chases our 19 year old cat.He is a happy menace, and I think this food helps."
4,Good read,"I enjoy all of Sylvia Brownes' books, and this one is no different. There are alot of skeptics ou there who don't care for her and her books. But, I really enjoy it all! Sylvias' books comfort me, and let me know that I am doing what I was ment to do. How do I know this? Because it just feels right, and I would not have trusted many of my instincts before reading her books and now I do. They give me the guidance and confidence I need to get through life."
5,"Sylvia is great ... jay ""evangalist"" another story entirely...","The book was great and well worth the investment. I find Sylvia to be a very interesting and helpful human being.Though I am a Christian person - the BIGGEST PART OF CHRISTIANITY TO LOVE AND BE KIND! I get so angry when I see posts like that from (jay ""evangalist"") what I call HYPOCRITICAL 'CHRISTIANS'. Check his posts... He clearly hasn't read any of her books - He made the same posting on every single one of her book comments."
3,HUH? I'm confused....,"Sylvia is delightful, but she can't seem to keep her stories straight. Discrepancies abound. In this book she states that a soulmate is one's ...""twin soul, created the same moment you were...."" In ""Conversations With The Other Side"" written two years later, Francine (Sylvia's guide who, one would think, would NOT give Sylvia false information), states, ""At times, more than one male may ask a particular female to be their soulmate."" Or, ""CHOOSING [emphasis mine] a soulmate always originates with the male entity."" So, which is it? A romantic coupling between two souls or that created-at-the-same-moment twin? Discrepancies aside, this little book is great reading and, as usual, Sylvia's humor is delightful!"
5,Awesome!!,This book was something very special and i think every person on this planet should get it and take the time to read it!!!! That' s all i have to say!!
1,What????,There is no way that anyone can know what life is like on the other side experientially. The only one that can know is Jesus Christ. (Who died and came back to tell others) A definite miss on a book why fill up your head with lies and conjecture.Don't waste your time!!!
4,"you've read one, you've read them all - but wait....","ive read the majority of sylvia browne's books and am always quick to snatch up new releases. i noticed they become repetitive even after reading only two or three. since i am a huge fan, this doesnt bother me. (well, maybe it does a little...)Blessings from The Other Side is far from her first publication and it does mimic a couple of her previous books, but its so uplifting and inspirational, those few tiny drawbacks fall by the wayside. if you are someone who is interested but a little annoyed by the repetition, this is a book for you. especially if you've lost a loved one, like i have. it offers comfort and wisdon, just as promised."
4,Encouragement to women of faith,"A rare book of encouragement to all the silent Christian women. Funny, moving and a very good read."
4,challenging and thought-provoking in typical Yancy fashion.,"All Yancy's books are well-written and thought provoking, and this one is no exception. However, I had a real problem with Yancy's statement that Africa is the most aggressively Christian continent in the world, yet is a country that suffers inexplicably because God allows the good and righteous to suffer. This is simply not true. While I agree that Christians suffer as much as anyone else, famine, disease and suffering in Africa are due largely to violence, rampant AIDS and despotic military leaders."
4,A New Appreciation for the Old Testament,"Yancey's book was an easy read. I felt I received a greater appreciation for books of the Bible that I've taken for granted in the past, namely the Psalms; and to background I hadn't considered before (his examination of the book of Ecclesiastes was truly eye-opening). I do feel Mr. Yancey has a tendency to say the same thing about four different ways before he moves on to a new point, but I think he is one of the most gifted writers, in or out of the ""Christian circle."" I am also indebted to him for his sincerity, his genuineness and his bluntness where others may otherwise tiptoe around subjects. His style is refreshing yet not condescending or boring. I have also read his ""Amazing Grace"" and would like to read ""The Jesus I Never Knew"" as I have heard only good reports on it."
4,A Good Message For Today's Church,"The basic premise of The Bible Jesus Read is that modern Christians make a mistake by ignoring the Old Testament in favor of just focusing on the New. In doing so we are giving ourselves an incomplete picture of who God is. The Old and New Testaments are meant to go hand in hand. Using Job, Deuteronomy, Psalms, Ecclesiastes, and the books of the prophets, Yancey shows that when we ignore the Old Testament we completely miss out on many vital aspects of the character of God. You cannot truly understand God without seeing him through both the Old and New lense.Not as earth-shaking as his previous work, What's So Amazing About Grace (that book changed my life), but an important and thoughtful read -- especially the sections on Job and Ecclesiastes. And any book that can make the minor prophets come alive deserves to be recognized. Four Stars."
5,an author who understands those who struggle,"Yancey is my favorite author. He writes from the perspective of someone who has had questions and struggles with his faith, who has fought through them and still believes, with a stronger and purer faith because of the struggle. This is another great book by him. I especially like his sections on Job and Ecclesiastes."
4,Good Yancey,"Once again Philip Yancey did an excellent job looking at the bible, and theology from a reporter's perspective, giving life to the Old Testament, the ""Bible Jesus Read."" This book really gave me a renewed interest into the Old Testament, and why it is so vital for any person interested in Christianity to read. Yancey explains how he struggled with the Old Testament when he was younger, and how he re-gained an interest in it once again. Right along with the author I discovered a new interest in the OT, and it really helped me at a time when I was going through the entire bible in six months. Sometimes when you read through the OT, it can get a bit dry, but Yancey, through this work, can inspire you, as he did me, to have an interest in what Jesus studied as a child, the Old Testament."
2,Yancey marvelous but subject comes short of expectation,"As a lifelong admirer of Yancey's work, I do not believe this is among his best work. Although impressive, the title is a little misleading. I did not come away with much insight other than a couple of old testament quotations that were presented in a modern light. I had honestly expected more fundamental revelation such as I found in Richard Patton's marvelous ""The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years"". Although lucidly written I didn't find the mother-lode the title would suggest."
1,Rambling and Slightly Flaky,"I have never read one of Philip Yancey's books before. If this is an indication of what the others are like, then I've not missed anything.I flipped over his protrayal of Moses as feeble, and with cataracts; the Bible explicitly speaks of Moses at his death as being strong and not having cataracts.The author also is a bit depressive for me. Life isn't as black and depressing as he protrays it, and the Old Testament isn't just full of people ranting and questioning God because they are depressed with life. This book leaves us with very little hope in the end. It even tells us, ""Do we matter? Does god care? We must live in faith, aware that those questions will lack a final answer until that decisive day when God does act, spectacularly, in Jesus' Second Coming."" We have to wait until the Second Coming to find out if God cares? If so, then I want nothing of Christianity. Jesus dying for us obviously shows us that God cares.Read another book."
1,Inaccurate,"Yancey's problem is that he follows fads. It's like in the movie, Good Will Hunting. Most of the people studying an issue will follow the latest fad. That's what Yancey does. The title, ""The Bible That Jesus Read"", insults Jesus Christ, who is God -- the Second Person in the Holy Trinity. The Old Testament and the New Testament clearly teach the Holy Trinity. Gospel of John chpater 1 shows all Three Persons of the Holy Triity operating. It is because people like Yancey has taken the helm of Christianity -- he is the editor of Christianity Today -- that America's Christianity is in grave trouble. Ordaining homosexuals? What do you think about that Yancey? Is that a part of the ""Bible that Jesus Read""? Ridiculous!!"
2,How Do You Tell A False Teacher?,"A true Christian teacher teaches the principles of the Holy Bible -- both the good and the bad. False teachers teach only what people want to hear. Yancey is like a false teacher. He doesn't want to teach anything that makes people uncomfortable -- such as the Holy God of the Bible ordered King Saul to annihilate all the Amalekits -- women, children, disabled included! This is our God! The God of the Bible we worship. If anyone has problem with the genocidal God of the Bible whom we worship as our God, then he can go to Hell. He will go to Hell because he doesn't believe in the God of the Bible who ordered King Saul to kill women, children, and the disabled."
2,bible jesus read participants guide-wrong order,"ordered the wrong book! Should have orderedthe Bible Jesus Read, Yancey, not Participant's guide. Will not be able to use and and have ordered the correct book."
2,spend a little more on a better one,"Was fairly comfortable at first, but does seem to feel pretty flat after about 1/2 hour. I wouldrecommend trying something different"
1,USELESS,Great disappointment! I am about 130lbs. This cushion does not give me any support at all. It becomes flat in less than 30 minutes.
1,It goes completely flat after a few uses.,It goes completely flat after a few uses.It's not worth the money.I now have to buy another wedge somewhere else.Manny
2,Disappointing,"I have degenerative disc disease with back pain and spasms; so when I buy pillows or cushions I am looking for something to give good, strong support, and this pillow offered a cushioned seat with cut-out to allow the spine to elongate to prevent pain. I also bought the pillow because it is portable and I intended to take it everywhere and use it when no other comfortable seating was available. However, I was greatly disappointed in this product. It does not keep a cushion and the pillow flattens out so you don't feel like you're sitting on a pillow at all. I gave it 2 stars because of the cut-out for the spine but all-in-all, the pillow was a let-down. No support whatsoever! Very disappointing. I would not recommend."
2,meh,"Doesn't hold up well after a week of use. I'm not heavy, and i'm still feeling my butt go numb because the cushioning doesn't hold shape very well"
2,as usual great service but quality was not typical of amazon,This product came quickly but i should have listened to the other reviewers. They said the cushion would squash flat in a week and it has. Just spend the extra dough and get some thing of a better quality. otherwise you will regret it in the long run
1,This cushion sucks,"I bought this cushion hoping it would make sitting at my computer for long hours more pleasant. Unfortunately after about half an hour, the ""memory foam"" gets totally squished down and it's almost useless. Don't try to save money by getting this cheap one - spend the extra money and get one that doesn't suck."
1,Don't waste your money on this!,"This product supplies NO support whatsoever. You sit on it and it flattens out. It also moves as soon as you sit on it. I have to keep getting up to put it in place again. It's a piece of crap and doesn't help my back at all. I rate this product ""zero"" stars."
4,Wedge Cushion,"Very comfortable, it could be a little thicker as it seems to squish down after you have been sitting on it for a while."
2,The Pain of it All,"I bought the ""Wagan 9788 Ortho Cushion"" and it does not meet the deminsions at all. The total lenght was to be 19"". It's 16 1/2"". ETC""How can Wagan screw up something like that, or did they? Making something to short by accident and lying to the people until it's fixed."
5,Great for those with tailbone problems/pain,"I use this in my car while driving. It takes pressure of your tailbone, which can reduce back pain (if you have lower back issues). I really recommend this prodcut, both for its function and its price."
2,Not a good buy,"I have lower back injuries and was looking for a pillow that would make sitting easier. This was not it. The foam isn't very firm and being a bigger woman made it flatten under me very easily. The wedge shape I will say helped a little, as the pillow DID relieve some pressure, just not enough. My mother, on the other hand, who has a bad shoulder, found a little relief from sitting on the cushion. She is, however, much skinnier than me and has no back problems that I know of."
5,Wagan Ortho Wedge Comfort Cushion,"The product arrived in a timely way, and it proved to be very helpful to me.I had recently had an internal hemorrhoid, and just sitting had been very uncomfortable. This cushion, because of its unique design, overcame that problem as the healing process progressed. I would highly recommend it to people with similar problems."
3,it's ok...and that's it,The wedge is ok. It cuts in behind my knees and the zipper placement needs to be improved. The zipper sticks out and will rub on your leg after a long drive. It's better than nothing on my truck seat ok....but just barely.
2,Not what the picture shows,"While the cushion has a blue zippered washable cover, it is only half as thick as shown in the picture and virtually useless. I guess I got what I paid for..."
1,Don't Brother,"Don't waste your money, have been sitting on it for a couple of days and it's flat as a pancake!! Im in a car all day and at 180 lbs. it was shot in two days!!"
1,Coccyx still hurts!,Wedge is not made of memory foam. It does not return to its original shape. My wedge is now flat and is of no help. It worked good for about 4 days but is now forever flat.
3,You get what you paid for,"I am a full time city bus driver, and I'm in the driver's seat for long periods of time with limited breaks. I bought this product hoping it would make seating in the driver's chair more comfortable, and it did for a few days, but like how other reviewers complained it flatten somewhat afterwards. It's still usable, but I wanted something that was going to last, and provide more cushion. I didn't give this product anything below three stars considering how inexpensive it was."
3,wagan in9788,I felt the product could have been a bit larger as my other ones. the thickness is fine I have a tailbone problem and the extra thick foam really helps.
5,helps!!,"I have recently had two back surgery's with a third in my near future, sitting has been one of the most painful things for me. This wedge cushion just might save my $500 recliner's life, helped the pain right away and I was able to sit in my recliner!!!"
1,A complete waste of money.,"There isn't much to say about this product other than this thing is actually very small and loses what little shape is has immediately, offering no support what-so-ever, but instead feels more uncomfortable...like sitting on a jacket."
4,Great Buy,This was a birthday gift for someone who had just purchased a new vehicle and needed a seat cushion to get comfortable. She really likes the cushion and the wedge design helped with accessing the pedals.
3,Wagan Ortho Wedge cushion,Wagan Ortho Wedge CushionThis product did not meet my requirements but was a beginning. It did not fit my driver's seat. The cut-out at rear of cushion was not comfortable and there was a gap between back of seat and cushion. The height and foam consistency were o.k. I took it to a custom upholsterer who made a new cushion the same general measurements with a rounded back edge and no semicircular cutout. Set me back $100 but at least I won't have to stare at the setting sun any more.
3,"Pretty good - kind of thin, which can be good or bad...","I've found these tailbone pads to be a real help - especially as I have an uncomfortable car seat and a long commute. This one is well made, so far as using it daily for about a month and a half goes. The one thing I wanted to say is that the pad is not as thick as some others and the foam is not a high density foam, so it squishes pretty much. I find this acceptable on my office chair, but not so good in my car."
1,It does not perform.,"This cushion, though it looks good to start, compresses down to less than two inches. I regret buying it."
1,This Wedge is not functional,After one week of using this Cushion there was no more support for anything. I was sadly disappointed. Didn't have the box to return it. Don't purchase this pillow. :(
2,The not that great cushion,"We have three of these now but have found that they flatten out and are not a solution for the discomfort my wife and I experience when sitting for more than 15 minutes. I am now trying out the more expensive ""Tuscush""."
2,very flimsy,"the foam is so soft that it pretty much flattens out when you sit on it, did not work at all"
2,seat cushion,"good for the price, was looking for more of a booster cushion. however it was not a much wedge as I wanted it to be."
2,It's hard,Not soft enough for me since I have a break. Would probably be fine if your just needing support for low back.
2,Not Very Firm,"I should have read the reviews first. This pillow is not nearly firm enough to do any good at all. There is little point to its wedge shape because both sides compress down to nothing when sat upon. In fact, I can pinch it all the way flat with two fingers. It's not very expensive but neither is it very good."
1,too small,"Not wide enough for those above 6' and 200+lbs. Possible use on a bucket seat for large people; but, impossible on a bench seat...constant balancing act to prevent cushion from slipping out from under."
3,Way too high,This pillow was too big in terms of height. My head was literally hitting the top of my car. And this was with the seat at it's lowest level. So back it goes. Maybe a shorter person will have more luck with the pillow.
1,Dissapointed.,"This cushion is hard, so hard it feels like a piece of hard foam. I tried it once and that was enough for me to not use it again. It is a shame as I really need it and was desperate to make it work. To be fair, if you use a hard chair, it might work for you. If your chair has some kind of cushion, don't waste your money as, again, this cushion is HARD."
2,Foam is Not Sturdy Enough,"Unfortunately, it compresses down to 1/2 inch or so pretty quickly. Other wedges are better."
1,Cushion - Not Really,The main problem of the cushion is that the foam does not hold up. I had this cushion for about a month and it is almost completely flat. The foam does not last very long. Don't buy this cushion if you want a good-quality cushion that will last a long time.
3,HELPFUL,"Because I travel a lot and drive many hours nonstop, my ""rumpus"" often gets TIRED AND OVERHEATED. There are many cushions out there to aid in this purpose. Most are worthless and those wich aren't cost close to $100. I bought the Wagan Ortho and like it enough to buy THREE MORE for the family. NEED I SAY MORE!?"
1,"This product is okay for the money, however I suggest you invest the money and get better support","This product is okay for the money it cost, however I suggest you invest the money and get a better support ... Wish I read the other reviews before I purchased this product ..."
5,This is my second one,"I bought one for myself but then gave it to my mom because she was having problems sitting on a hard chair. I ordered another one for myself. I use it in my car and it makes a big difference, especially on long trips."
5,Helps a lot,This is really very helpful and affordable. I would definitely recommendusing this if you have back pain issues. Good for car as well as home.
2,"Poor design, poor heat.","I found that only one side of the grill gets hot enough to cook on, and even that side produces sad, grey burgers and grills corn in three or four times the time it would take on a charcoal (or full-size gas) grill.The grill is constructed so that it is impossible to cook with the lid down, which further limits its usefulness.If you want a moderately convenient way to heat up hot dogs, this might suit your purpose. I don't think it's good for much else."
2,Buyer beware..,"I received my grill and I also found the packaging was not adequate to protect the grill. One of the corners of the base was badly bent and 2 of the inside tabs (that hold the heat diffuser plate were bent down flat against the side. I was able to bend the metal tabs up enough to get the job done, but the bent corner is still somewhat mangled. The tool tray has to be ordered seperately and it is quite a bit smaller than the grill, causing it to slide around on top of the grate and bang when being transported. The tools included with the tray have a ""cheap"" feel to them and the tongs are completely useless. I gave 2 stars for the novelty factor and compact size.."
3,Review by Motor Home User,"When the unit arrived, the first problem was that the box it is shipped in doesn't hold up to UPS handling, and parts of it were badly bent. We were able to bend them back most of the way they were originally and started to cook. Better packaging is needed by either Amazon or the manufacturer to protect the unit during shipment.The best way to look at this unit is that its cooking method is different than one that uses lava rock or real charcoal. It does cook well if an aluminum cover is put over the items being cooked. If cooking two hamburger patties, you will waste the heat of 75% of the grilling surface. We are still in the trial mode with the unit, but one must understand that it is just different."
4,There is no reason not to bar-be-que,"My husband received one of these gas grills for his birthday. To this day, we are surprised how much we use it. In the Spring and Summer months, most of our food is prepared outdoors, and it has been so nice to have a portable grill that we can take just about anywhere (the beach, tailgaiting and even camping). Most of all we use it in our backyard!!! My husband thinks nothing of starting up the grill now. What a wonderful and novel gift to give. It has proved to be durable and efficient. I'll be giving a few of these out around Christmastime."
1,Very poor quality,"My sons received this for Christmas and it's already out of commission. The quality of the fabric (more like paper) is such that the polls very quickly poked through, leaving the folding/elasticated sticks to stick out.It's a great idea, but if it was a better material so that it would last more than a couple of weeks...Here's hoping that I can sew up the holes without tearing it more."
2,barely average whodunnit thriller,"This is a below-average whodunnit thriller that stars a pudgier Tom Berenger. Not much action here, it's a thriller that relies a lot on the dialogue to carry the story. The plot is somewhat convoluted, as many important characters to the story are mentioned only by name, and some aren't seen until late in the movie, so it's important to pay attention to the dialogue in detail. It's somewhat hard to keep the plot straight in the 1st viewing, but makes a lot more sense watching it the 2nd time.Berenger is ideally suited as the veteran hard...cop who takes no gruff, Lori Heuring provides nice eye candy as the damsel in distress, and there is a nice plot twist that I didn't see coming that helps make up for the rather slow-moving story.Barebones DVD, with just 3 trailers as the only bonus features..."
3,Better than average TV thriller,"The plot is familiar as is the case for most of these detective movies that don't make it to theatres. But this movie has some interesting twists and the pace is good. Tom Berenger, as always, turns in a credible performance as the typical cop on the edge (who few people care to work with) and the rest of the cast are quite good. The are many worse ways to spend an hour and half."
3,Great collection of the non-glamorous punks in the world,"Die Toten Hosen one of the best German punk bands around has really teamed up to bring a great collection of older punk songs to the younger generation that has been living with bubble punk.All song are sung with a member of the band that originally composed the music. Including luminaries like joey Ramone, Johnny thunder, and wreckless eric.Take a spin on the simple side of punk and get an insight as to what the movement was like before it became overly commercial or to associated with skin-heads.The liner notes are great too!!"
5,MacInnis Does it Again,"The ""Remembering..."" series transcends normal biography by showcasing top quality journalist's recollections with statistics and insights into the player and their game.Remembering the Golden Jet is no different. From Bobby Hull's early days playing minor hockey, to his watershed defection from the NHL to play for Winnipeg, a move that would rock the hockey world and force the league to re-evaluate it's salary policy forever.For Blackhawks fans this book charts the progress of a player who was feared by goalies everywhere for his blistering slapshot.I have read every Bobby Hull book out there, and nothing comes close in it's insights, in it's recognition of Hull as a true Legend of the game, as this beautifully designed book.I can't recommend it highly enough."
5,Great read for any college football fan!,"I really enjoyed this read. However, I am a huge SEC college football fan. There were a few laugh-out-loud parts, and most of the book kept a good humurous pace. I would definitely recommend this book to any sports fan!"
4,A worthy read,"I am a college football fan and that helps when reading this book. I should say it is not completely necessary though. I found this book to be a interesting look at a sub culture of the sport I love. The book is fair and clear in presentation, no effort to hide the ugly part of this world, or sauce up the fun part. Mostly the book speaks about a interesting journey I wish I had the guts (and the time) to take.I always measure a book by am I happy I bought it or do I wish I had gotten it out of the library. I am happy I bought this book, and you will be as well."
3,Well written - too much football for me,"I read this for my book club. I am not a sports fan AT ALL, but enjoyed the book up to a point. The stories of the folks who follow their team were interesting and well done. The unending tale of football players and stats was of no interest to me. Others in the club (including some from Alabama) loved it."
2,"Nice read, but probably only for college football junkies (like me)","St. John's book is fun to read if you're a college football fan and been involved with tailgating and RV'ing to a game. He isn't a very accomplished writer with a lot of poorly phrased ideas, strangly structured chapters and several out of place remarks. That's really criticizing his style more than substance, so others may not be as annoyed by it as I was, but on almost every page something showed me his writing could have used a good edit (or rewrite).I love the topic he picked and thoroghly enjoyed reading about the Alabama football culture. It's a lot of fun to read about, but I'd be surprised if anyone outside of the college football universe would care much for it."
2,Rammed and Jammed,"Gee, there are loyal fans who follow football games and hold tailgate parties on the parking lots of football stadiums. Who knew? Let's send an investigative reporter to rip the lid off this social phenom. This is the tired core of this overexposed tome. Be forewarned there are some dreary racial views expressed in this book, and the author's attitude has been excoriated in the new-South publication Nashville Scene. I picked up this book to find out what the racial controversy was about. Putting it down was no problem for me."
4,"Comfortably Palatable, but Overtly Allegorical","Lilith is certainly one of MacDonald's more allegorical works; the texture of its prose is atypically cryptic, although not without substance. Mr Vane is the only really believable character in the entirety of the book, and even then his realisations and personal developments lack subtlety and are not delicately handled by MacDonald. Nevertheless, what the book lacks in characters it makes up for in a well-paced plot that makes for comfortable reading on any lazy, rainy day."
5,Lilith,"G.K.Chesterton once said, ""Fairytales are the sunny land of common sense."" And if anyone can make a charming, funny, exciting fairytale and bring it to life that, my friends, would be the wonderful George MacDonald. Snaps to George for having such a fanbloodytastic mind."
4,This Is an Epic Book,"If you're gonna buy this book, buckle up. MacDonald is the master of allegory. There are so many metaphors, comparisons, you won't even be able to keep up. Not to mention the tremendous amount of philosophy you'll find. Lilith is not like any fantasy you've ever heard of."
3,Classic Fantasy,"George MacDonald's 'Lilith' is a a classic of fantasy fiction. Largely allegorical, it tells the tale of Mr. Vane's adventure's 'through the looking glass' as it were. Mr. Vane has many strange adventures but the story meanders somewhat until Mr.Vane encounters Lilith, from here the story picks up. But as others have noted, MacDonald is not the best writer, often it is not exactly clear what is happening, as one example it is often unclear which of the two leopardesses is being referred to at any time. As for the theological arguments being advanced by MacDonald I am not qualified to offer an opinion.The average reader will probably be unimpressed but for those interested in religious allegory or classic fantasy there is much to admire, as there are many memorable episodes and interesting ideas within the novel."
2,Completely Crazy and Unrealistic,"This book is insane. He follows a Raven through a mirror into another world. There is also a lot of reference to the Bible and if you don't know about the Bible you will get lost. The end is also very confusing. The end makes little sense and there is a sense of being unfinished to it. Some parts were ok but the overall book was weird and confusing.My overall feeling towards the book was that it was weird. Broken up though, parts were ok. The begining was weird and confusing. The middle was pretty good. Escpecially when he is with the Little Ones. The end, however, is horrible. There actually is no end. No one is really sure how it ends because of the abrupt and mysterious ending.If fairy tales are your thing you might like this book, but if you want to read about something that has any chance of happening this book is not for you."
4,"Lilith, A Romance.","Lilith, A Romance.Great story. It is very nice as this is my first Kindle Fire book. I have enjoyed it."
5,A beautifully Haunting tale,This book's imagery alone is so amazing. I read this in two days straight because I could not put it down.
2,"Thought I would like it, but...","Since I like MacDonald's novels in general, I thought I would like Lilith, but I didn't. Maybe it's too difficult for me. I fought through it and enjoyed certain portions, but I was tempted not to finish it. I think it might be ""over my head."" I'm not talking about the ""universalist"" theology of it, because I understand what he is saying there, although I think the Bible clearly does not support it (I sense a temptation within myself to wish universalism were true), but I could have found much value in the story anyway if I could have understood it more thoroughly. I'm writing this review as a warning to readers like me who enjoy MacDonald's non-fantasy novels (and I prefer his originals there to the modernized versions) but will find Lilith to be a far different reading experience, one that they may not enjoy."
5,Enjoy other worlds? This is the book for you!,"I would recomend this book to anyone who enjoys adventure, other worlds, thinking about strange but wonderful things, and using their imagination. This is one of the best books I have ever read. I could not put it down!!"
1,Not Up to Other Horror Greats of His Era,This book put me to sleep every time I went to read it. I read dry histories without falling asleep. This is a mighty indictment from me.
4,Tales from the Muj!,"This is a one of a kind historical account/manual of guerilla tactics used by The Afghan rebels against The Russians during the Soviet-Afghan war. This book contains nothing but real play-by-play accounts. This book is entertaining to read, but the translated tales lack a story-telling quality that makes for fairly dry reading. In a way the matter- of -fact style of the stories lends to the brutality and realism of these true tales of war. Soldiers in Afghanistan should read both this book and it's famous but rare couterpart ""The Bear Went over the Mountain""."
4,Organic Techno at it's best!,"This Is a great CD, Don't be fooled by his early selling out. This Is bass that you could really bust the windows out of your car with. The songs are just simple Beats, with a few clips thrown in, but It's about as original as you're gonna get. Also, the video on the CD (enhanced) is worth buying the CD for alone. Mr. Oizo, I salute you!"
4,Analog synths and funky beats at their best!,"Not too many people have heard of Mr. Oizo, aside from, perhaps, ""Flat Beat"" which aired on MTV for a number of weeks a couple years ago (God forbid anyone actually watch that channel though). After hearing ""Flat Beat"" I immediately fell in love (and who could resist with that curiously humorous puppet from the video?)After listening to the album all the way through, I immediately started it over and switched on 'repeat'. This is an album that I can hardly stop listening to. Its funky sounds and curious off-beat tempo adds an almost unsurpassable flavor to the songs.Although this CD is incredibly amazing (to me) I had to give it a 4 out of 5 because of the repitition of sounds and beats. As much as I love it, anyone out there that isn't into this particular genre may find the repeating beats and sounds annoying about halfway through the album.If you liked ""Flat Beat"" and particularly enjoy the electronica genre this album is a definite ""must have""."
2,A first-hand account of the Communist takeover in post-war Poland,"The Rape of Poland is useful as a historical document giving one the persepctive of the ""government in exile"", and detailing the Communist takeover. Mikloajczyk takes no responsibility for the ascention of the Communists after World War II in Poland, instead blaming the Nazis, the Poles who remained during the war, the Soviets and even the Allies themselves. His discussion of the rigged and corrupt elections is accurate and in this reader's opinion, the best part of the book. For a similar discussion of the collapse of east and central Europe I recommend Thomas T. Hammond's _Anatomy of a Takeover_."
5,Great little book,"Slip the word ""heroes"" into a title and a kid's attention will lock on it like a missle. Kids are just naturally drawn to heroes and heroines and here is a treasure trove of some of the very first from the bible in a very accessible Little Golden Book. Who doesn't remember Little Golden Books from their own childhood? And at 2.99, this is a downright steal for 24 pages of truly beautiful little paintings from artist Ande Cook. Her appealing art has turned this Golden Book into a real treasure."
3,An arcane journey into the Egyptian past,"This book elucidates how ancient Egyptians believed that the sun had a position in the center of a cosmography in the afterlife. When Man died, he entered the cosmography of eternity, but faced obstacles anterior to the sun. For example, a gated wall might have obstructed a person's entry into the delectable area close to the sun. Additionally, after death, a person experienced the transmigration of the soul. Thus, a person might have reincarnated into an animal. Altogether, a fascinating look into Egyptian afterlife with detailed illustrations to complement the text. This author used excellent sources, including the pyramid texts, which greatly contributed to the book's historical accuracy. At the end of the book, a useful glossary aids the reader for insight into Egyptian technical terms."
4,More Positive interaction with company...,"I ordered this product specifically because it had a fixed broom head. The company sent me an adjustable broom head model. Turns out they had run out of the fixed head version. Not being happy with the adjustable head, I contacted the company and ask for options to get the fixed head broom. Long story short, they allowed me to keep the model sent by mistake, and provided me with a full refund. Perfect customer service. I'm looking forward to them getting the fixed head model so I can purchase that form them. Great interaction with the company."
3,Just what it says it is,I have a little bit of hard time working with this. I can't seem to get the Ice scrapper to work correctly.
2,Not what I expected,"I love all the old sci fi films and comedies like Abbott and Costello go to Mars, but this one is just plain silly."
4,Delightfully cheesy,"It looks pretty dated, with crouched-over guys in bug suits, a cheerfully dotty amateur scientist, and the obligatory saveable babe. Oh, and that little moon-ship had eating facilities, but not a lot for dealing with the inhabitants' other needs of nature.We don't see them until way past the half-way point, but Harryhausen's wonderful stop-animation makes this memorable. That includes a dancing skeleton, a whale-sized caterpillar, and a few other goodies. The ending shouldn't be a surprise to anyone who's seen War of the Worlds - I haven't read the book in decades, though, so I can't say how closely this tracks Wells's original.No matter, it's a popcorn movie. Wait for a rainy Saturday and run the flicks - the popcorn will taste just as good either way.-- wiredweird"
3,Comical,"My husband remembered it from when he was a kid. He loved as a 7 years old. He wanted me to watch. Not my kind of show, but I can see as a young kid back in the day, how it would have been liked."
4,Pure mush for the brain,"This movie is great! Not to be taken seriously. Just enjoyed. It was well written and well acted and is fanciful in nature.It is a very good adaptation of H.G. Wells novel. There is a subtle message at the very end if you're interested. It relates to something which, not highlighted, was included throughout the movie.Recommendation: Get this. Saturday afternoon excitement. Not serious. No thought processes required. Just enjoyable mush for the brain."
4,"Because In 1899, Nobody Would Have Said ""On the Moon""","Nope, nothing to do with much of it taking place in Lunar caverns.A witty novel that mingled Victorian scientific speculation with political satire, turned into a sparkling film that has first-rate 1960s special effects and the atmosphere of a musical comedy (I could so easily imagine Cavor and his assistant suddenly bursting into, ""Cavorite, Cavorite,the element with the power of flight!"").I saw it on TV when my age was single-digit and again in my teens. I was appalled that my wife had never seen it, so we remedied that omission. We have now watched all of the DVD releases of Harryhausen films, but agree that this is the best of them."
5,Great old movie!,This must be where NASA got the idea for the Apollo program!Way ahead of its time for 1964! Great!!
3,"Great Copy, Great Service, Just didn't like the movie.","My DVD copy was crisp and clear. Delivery was very quick. It's just I didn't care for the movie. There were no real heros, except for the aliens. Plus the main character was a self centered boor, who put everyone at risk."
4,Good or Bad,"One of the better 1950's scifi. Good story line and decent acting. It is up there with the original Thing, Them, and Earth vs. The Flying Saucers."
3,Moon Review,"Being a Sci-Fi collector and a Space Program Enthusiast, I believe this movie is another good example of good imagination that helped form where we are today with both Sci-Fi and the space program."
4,First men in the moon,"I own this DVD. This is a real oldie but goodie! I love it now, as I did when I was a boy. Excellent special effects for its time. Very entertaining; even for today's Sci-Fi fans."
3,Destination Moon Review,"Movie is ""just ok""; not what I remembered. Price and service were great. I'd buy from them again."
3,A bit dated,Although there is some merit in this film it cannot be considered a classic sci-fi film- it would take away from the real value of he true sci-fi ones. The plot is about the very first expedition to the Moon around the turn of the 20th century. Some of the scenes are a bit comical- but that is not entirely a bad thing as it lightens the film and makes it more enjoyble for kids to watch. It is a bit dated but one should also consider the time that it was produced.All in all a good family film that your kids will enjoy.
3,OK TO KILL TIME,"This movie might have been great 50 years ago, but is just so-so today. Still I think it would be great for the kiddies to watch!"
3,Howard's review,Good for its' time. Enjoued watching it in front of the big svrfeen TV with popcorn.
2,Old movie,"Not quite how I remembered it, it is very dated and even the special effects are not the interesting to see."
4,Classic Old Sci-Fi!,"I first saw this movie on television sometime around 1965-66, when I was about 10 or 11 years old, and it just made my imagination soar back then. I rank it up there with ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"", ""The Angry Red Planet"", and ""War of The Worlds"" movies. All greats, which I also own! Being on DVD just makes it that much better. While admittedly it doesn't compare to todays special effects, it was really good stuff back then. For those of us whose saw and enjoyed it in our youth, it's very nostalgic. If your an old classic Sci-Fi enthusist, such as I, by all means get it. You won't regret it."
4,Go to the moon!,"This is a wonderfully fun movie, a mixture of humor and semi-seriousness about three people who go to the moon in a machine invented by a strange, very strange, scientist at the turn of the century. Lots of fun, and very enjoyable. You'll like the antics of the eccentric scientist (Lionel Jeffries)."
4,Go to the moon!,"This is a wonderfully fun movie, a mixture of humor and semi-seriousness about three people who go to the moon in a machine invented by a strange, very strange, scientist at the turn of the century. Lots of fun, and very enjoyable. You'll like the antics of the eccentric scientist. At the end of the movie, if you're like I am, you're sure to say ""Imperial""."
3,Great movie,"Another old 60's B movie. Had some great actors in it from that era. well worth the purchase, good old movie............"
4,Two for One,"An entertaining rendition of the H.G. Wells book. A little slow in the beginning with the courting of two lovers, but overall good family entertainment. It soon moves along and has some funny scenes with the professor and nice special effects done by Ray Harryhausen on the moon and with its inhabitants. The restoration of this classic is beautifully done and the sound is exceptional. Since this includes the ""The Harryhausen Chronicles"" which is sold on DVD for better than half the price of this one DVD it is a bargain. Get it, you won't be disappointed unless you detest science fiction."
5,A must for everyone!!!,"H.G. Wells' First Men in the Moon is one of the best sci-fi films for any person whose imagination runs wild with the simplest idea to put men on another planet and for those who love movies of creatures, aliens, or monsters. This film happens to be a treasure for me. Any parents whose children like to be entertained with good stories should get this film. I enjoyed it when I was a child and I still enjoy it as an adult. If you liked ""the day Earth stood still,"" ""when worlds collide,"" etc then this is a must buy for you."
4,Stupid entertainment.,"Basically, the killer Angela has returned and is killing off all of the bratty girls and boys while they are setting up camp.This film puts the 'camp' in Sleepaway Camp. Pure, cheeseball entertainment. It's worth the 5 bucks that's being charged!"
3,Sleepaway Camp 3: Teenage Wasteland,"This is the 3rd installment to the ""Sleepaway Camp"" series and you guessed it Angela is back. If you are unfamilar with this series see my reviews.We left off last time at Camp Rolling Hills where Angela went on her killing spree! Now the camp has been sold to Herman and Lilly Miranda and they have re-opened it as ""Camp New Horizonz"".This time we bring together inner city kids with the high class teens to begin a lesson on learning how to cope with one another. Sharing in the wonders of the great outdoors.It doesn't take long before Angela starts to repeat her history and the murders begin. Will anyone but Angela survive this time...Again the gore does not let down our horror fans and Angela finds new ways to off her victims.If you enjoyed the first two movies you have to see this one. I will say the first is my favorite with a unsuspected ending! That is a must see!"
2,Sleepaway Camp 3- The Legacy Edition,"Note: This review is for the Legacy edition of the film and not the newer version, where the cover is just a close-up on breast and a knife. I prefer this version because the cover is cool, although it looks like the cover or part 2 of the remastered dvds.I highly enjoy this series and I figured i'd complete the set by buying this dvd. Angela is back and killing more campers, what else would it be about? While the first one was shocking and full of twists, the second was nothing but fun. The third is decent but nothing worth going out of your way for, maybe if you need to complete your collection or just want something to watch because you've seen everything else. The kills were good but not to graphic, I thought this dvd might have edited some deaths scenes but it's the way they were filmed. The lawnmower death would have been better if they showed a little blood. Overall, the picture quality is good but the film isn't. I got it just to complete a collection."
5,My Favorite!,"I bought this product because I needed a lightweight, washable white comforter. When I saw this one folded in the photo, I figured it had to be lightweight. It's light, fluffy, and washes well. The directions say to have it dry cleaned, but I decided to wash it on delicate. Comes out just fine. I plan to purchase more."
5,amazing,this is one heck of a book. It really made me realize how lucky i am to have the life i have. I highly suggest this book for everyone of all ages.-jamie
4,Sirius Suction,When I purchased my satellite radio the mount that came with the system didn't work with my car. I drive and infinity G35 and for all those who drive them know that the dashboard is curved thus making it impossible to mount anything on it. I did some research and found this suction-cup mount kit and it works great. I highly recommend this product for anyone that 1. drives and infinity G35 or 2. just wants a cleanly mounted system.
4,Great Product,This mount really holds to the window and is easy to release when necwssary. It is very versitile but could use at least one more swivel point.
2,Not what I expected,I was disappointed with this exercise video. The music was the same through all the segments. I was expecting more of a variety with the music.
2,A little to slow for my taste .....,"I was very disappointed, wish I could get my money back. She was off beat and not very motivating. Maybe my mother will like it, she's 68."
1,disappointed,very amateurish - at times she seemed to trip over herself - I liked the music and dance exercise so the idea has potential but I think they need to do a remake and dub out her mistakes.
4,Better than I thought it would be.,I had never heard of Joyce Vedral till I bought this CD. Apparently she is and has been a celebrity for some time. I think she is a real character and it is nice to work out with someone around the same age as me. She promises you she will work you like a dog and she does. That is OK because I bought the CD hoping to get a good workout. She is not going to replace Leslie and Denise who are my favorite workout DIVAs but this CD is most certainly going to be used when I need a break from those two. I like it well enough to look into the possibility of buying some others.
2,Too much counting of the steps,"The instructor recites the counts of all the steps, 1,2,3, etc., for most of these routines. This repetitive counting was annoying. Her accent was irritating, and the steps were too simple and boring."
1,Stick with the wooden bead cushion!,"The soft foam beads neither cools nor massages, and the magnets are too sparsely placed to really do anything. My old wooden bead cushion provided far better support and cooling."
4,good purchase,"Recently developed arthritis in my lower back, this cushion helps me during the day at work in my office chair."
3,not what i expected,"the cushion is really too small for the bucket seat, the straps don't hold it so it keeps slipping around.I will say where it covers the seat it does protect you from burning your legs & back , but it would be better if it were wider & had fasteners that would hold it still. I think I should have paid more & got something that fit better.G. Stack"
3,Not bad for the price,It's okay. It serves the purpose. Could have a bit more cuchion and a better way to keep it in place.
3,jury still out,I like the cushion but it hasnt cured all my ills. Magnets may be a placebo but it does provide a little massage and air flow.
5,Every space buff should own this.,I finished this book and kept looking for more. This indeed was a hard book to put down. Mr. Kraft takes the reader from square one of the United States first attempts to challenge Russia's coup with Sputnik until he left the agency in 1982. Well written and very reader friendly as he does not overwhelm you with technical jargon. I hope he writes another book about this subject he knows so thoroughly.
4,Not a Bad Book,I liked reading about how Chris Kraft moved up to a prominent place in the space program. He didn't seem to be all that wild about Gene Krantz though!
3,Chris Kraft is not a pleasant man,"I enjoy all the books on the space program and I am really glad that Scott Carpenter was able to tell his side of of the story in his book ""For Spacious Skies"" (which is very good). Chris Kraft makes Scott out to be a dopey day dreamer behind the controls of the Mercury Capsule. Chris ensures that the world knows that it was ""his"" decision alone to kick Scott out of the space program. Chris should have been more fair and point out that Scotty was overloaded with ""space experiments"". It was Scotty's flight that proved that you cannot overload the man in capsule with experiments and NASA never did it again in the ""and on"" flights. Give Scotty a break. He put put his life on the line while Chris played big shot engineer."
1,"Good, but not great","No question that Chris Kraft's contributions to the space race were enormous. That being said, he comes across as such a bitchy little thing. Can't resist trashing others - especially Scott Carpenter. Anyone who was willing to strap themselves into one of those early capsules that was then attached to one of those early rockets does not deserve such rancor. There were bound to be mistakes. Minimizing mistakes as well as learning from mistakes was top priority. Everyone involved seemed to recognize this. But, Chris Kraft just couldn't resist getting in the last negative word about Carpenter. If Chris Kraft was as important and as powerful as he said he was seems like he could have delayed Carpenter's turn until he deemed Carpenter ready. Just sayin"
5,Anonymous,"Excellent read! Loaned out the book and never got it back, so this was a replacement purchase. Enjoyed reading it the second time as much as the first. Good complement to other books of the period, from the very unique viewpoint of one who made unparalleled contributions to his profession. Highly recommended."
5,Quality Porter Cable Product.,"We have tried other brands of sand paper but always come back to Porter Cable. My job is not the woodworking it is buying the supplies for employees and family. To make my job easier, keeping everyone working and the complaints to a minimum is priority one.Porter Cable products make my life easier. :)"
3,Cute book,"Purchaced this as a birthday gift for grandson. My wife read him the book before he went to bed, which he really liked. Grandson is usually bouncing off the wall, but he stayed quiet and listened."
5,Dumb reviewer,"I'm sure you'll get plenty of mail about your reviewer, John Mattlock ""Gunny"" (6/21) who commented on the ""dumb"" special ed topic.This idiot is dumb himself. Special ed is for children with learning disabilities, not for dumb kids. How dare you publish his comments!I wouldn't ask him to teach a dead horse never mind a living human being."
3,Answers,"This book answered a question that has bothered me for some time: What do all those former teachers do for a living?With tales from aspiring, current, and former teachers of all ages and subject areas, this book tells the truth.Unfortunately, it seems that teachers (like me) are more interested in reading it than those in a position to aid reform measures.Honestly, the book was discouraging and fed into another question I tend to ask myself: ""What else am I qualified to do?""I prefer books that motivate and encourage reform, although a section of this book did discuss successful alternative pay systems."
2,TEACHERS DON'T HAVE IT THAT EASY,"Man, is this book depressing. While the book's primary focus is on the many problems facing teachers as a group which are revealed through a collection of short stories, it aptly addresses the bureaucratic issues that plague high schools across the country. Right when you start to feel totally depressed about your career choice as a teacher, the book (thankfully) sites examples of schools and school systems that are committed to providing greater opportunity and pay for its best teachers. Every teacher will see a part of themselves and their struggles in these stories."
1,Please Pass This Up,I did not enjoy this one at all. The CD could have been arranged better and a few songs could have been left out. A waste of money.M.D.D.
2,What a Pity!,"The Music is very interesting if you are already a fan of both Robert Wyatt or Soft Machine. But the sound is pretty awfull. I've got bootlegs that sound much better than this. The companion cd Turns On volume 2 has a slightly better sound, with embrionic takes of Moon in June and Esther's Nose Job.These releases are for die hard fans ears only."
4,Good tool,"I own at least a dozen of these sanders and have retired several over the last 10 years at my cabinet shop. I just purchased two more. We use them hard and they roll around in the back of trucks and yes, get dropped on occasion. Bottom line is they hold up well and they have made some good changes over the years that eliminated some problem areas. They are well balanced easy to use and have plenty of power. The only flaw that I see in them is the knob that adjusts the belt sticks out too far and gets bent if the sander gets hit or dropped just wrong.I'm not a real fanatic about the ""buy america"" thing but I was disturbed a couple of years ago when I needed to replace the cord on one of the sanders. On the outside was a sticker with the red white and blue and it said ""Proudly made in the USA"" on it. Whe I opened it up I noticed a tag on the switch that said ""made in Mexico"". Did Mexico join the USA when I wasn't looking? What I don't like is false advertising."
4,Seems to be a nice little cookbook...,"Book is very small but packed with yummy recipes. I haven't tried them, but as I catalog all my recipes (so I can find what I need quickly), here is a run down of all recipes in the book and their page numbers:Basic White Bread p. 12Potato Bread p. 14Cracked Wheat Sunflower Loaf p. 16Jewish Rye p. 18Pumpernickel p. 20Oatmeal Bran Bread p. 22Rustic Country Loaf p. 24English Muffin Toasting Loaf p. 26Brioche p. 30Baguettes p. 32Croissants p. 34Currant-Walnut Baguettes p. 37Challah p. 40Parmesan Bread p. 43New York Bagels p. 45Italian Pizza Rolls p. 48Corn Tortillas p. 50Irish Soda Bread p. 52Chinese Steamed Buns p. 54Pan Dulce p. 56Banana Bread p. 60Skillet Corn Bread p. 62Lemon Pecan Tea Bread p. 64Spoon Bread p. 66Wheat Currant Scones p. 67Buttermilk Doughnuts p. 70Pecan Sticky Buns p. 72Giant Cinnamon Buns p. 74Soft Pretzels p. 76Kaiser Rolls p. 79Hot Dog and Burger Buns p. 82Greek Easter Bread p. 86Panettone p. 89Kulich p.91Stollen p. 94"
4,Nice recipe book.,"This is a nice recipe book. I'm new at baking and was hoping for more tips and instructions, which this book doesn't have. However, it does have a lot of great recipes. Also, it's small with no pictures (I like visuals to help me know what to expect the finished product to look like!)"
4,Nothing in Common,"If you like Tom Hanks and Jackie Gleason, you'll love this DVD version of this movie. I saw it on the Pay per View channel and decided to get the DVD. Glad that I did."
3,...an audacious act of parent-child relationship,"After watching Tom Hanks and Jackie Gleason act out the common scene between a father and a son, I myself was drawing into a sensible phase. Jane English in her tidbit of familial obligations comments ont eh realtionship that the child has with their parents. Her view is that the child owes nothing back to the parent...it should not be an ""obligation"" but a privilege, somethingt he chils desires. After watching this film, one can only hope that they would be so sincere to their parents. The love that Tom shows his father in this movie is genuinely played on screen. From his numerous talks with his dad to the despairing but later inspiring limb ""chopping"" operation. I give this film three stars - one for the father, one for the son, and one for their relationship."
1,Not a pretty sight,"Full disclosure: I do not know anything about bodhrans. I purchased one for my musician daughter (not a bodhran player either) as a surprise Christmas gift. I liked the sound of the instrument but returned it because the drum head appeared to be defective and I didn't want to give it as a gift.The drum sounded good but the drum head was translucent in three separate areas -I could see my hand through it and it just didn't seem right. The manufacturer said this was not a defect so they would not replace it, but they did refund my money. Buyer beware - the picture shows just the back of the drum. If you know more about bodhrans than I do, and this is how they are suppose to look, then definitely ignore this comment!"
5,As advertised; fast shipping!,Excellent novel with great historical perspective regarding the Turks and the Greeks. I find that the author's writing style really engages the reader.
5,Luminous and lucid,"One of the best books I've read, funny, tragic, heartbreaking. De Berneres is a master of language, his writing is rich, elegant and evocative. He writes with obvious love for his characters. Whether a hundred years ago or today, people are far more complex, and perhaps better, than our artificial (political and religious) divisions imply. Birds Without Wings opens your heart to that realization."
5,A world of interesting characters,Birds Without Wings by Louis de Bernieres was worth the wait. At first glance it may not seem like a book to bring to the cottage but de Bernieres ability to create a whole village of interesting characters is a perfect book to sit back in an Adirondack chair and let the day slide by. I found myself wanting to learn more about the actual events of the novel's time-frame and I was satisfied that the book was not Captain Corelli's Mandolin but another showcase for de Bernieres' immense talent.
2,Informative but ultimately too gruesome,"The book has many interesting, poignant vignettes of life in the old Ottoman empire. However, if you are influenced by what you read, this will crush you. It's sad, maddening, gruesome. It's a very tough read. Not many uplifting moments."
4,Turkish Delight,"Hear, hear to the first review! de Berneires is a powerful writer, juxtaposing very human villagers in southwest Turkey with the history of the era. This is a must read for anyone who has been to Turkey or wants to go there."
2,"Listed as ""new"", but spine was a little wobbly","The hardback book was really inexpensive, which is good, but the spine was not securely attached to the book, so it did not feel like a new book. I had bought it as a gift, so I was disappointed.I would have preferred to pay more and get a really new book."
3,Not a Mandolin,"I have only read Corelli's Mandolin prior to this read.This book is very slow going. The characters are less compelling as is the multi-plot sequencing. I felt like just reading each character's story as a novella, skipping the other chapters. I haven't finished yet and given good reviews will try to, but it is still at least 100 pages too long - repetitious and unnecessarily long sentences.John Schneiderman's review is spot on.."
3,Timewarps for dummies.,"After the brilliant book ""About Time"" I was reallylooking forward to Paul Davies next book onTime.But as a followup to ""About Time"" ""How to builda timemachine"" is a bit disappointing.I had expected a fountain of new ideas on wormholesin spacetime and their use for time travel. Plus allsorts of other ideas like e.g. Tiplers rotatingcylinders with the possibility of global causalityviolations and more.Instead the book revisits some of the material coveredin ""About Time"" in a shortened format. Other partsare covered more extensively in Richard GottsTimetravel in Einsteins universe.So all in all I would only recommend this bookfor someone who hadn't read anything about relativity,timetravel and spacetime before. And weren't lookingfor to much detail.With that said the book is still pretty entertaining.-Simon"
3,Okay.....,"Do not be decieved by the title. This book explains how it is possible to create a time machine, but if you're hoping that this is a step-by-step manual on a homeade time machine, forget it. Paul Davies explains that, to create a time machine, you would have to have all sorts of scientific tools only avaliable to scientists; actually, some of the required elements to build a machine are not yet invented (exotic matter, negative energy, ect.) Basically, Davies explains that, if a time machine was to be made, it would a big factory.But, if you're getting this book just for a science-fiction-turned-to-science-fact book, then I strongly recommend it. Davies has an excellent style of writing, and if this is just for fun, then it's right for you."
2,Maybe third time is a charm???,"I'm about to buy my second replacement, after the glass cracked on the first two. Quality is very low, but the ability to put this feeder right on our kitchen window is wonderful and our children adore it. If I could find any similar product from another manufacturer, I'd buy it instead."
4,A nice product,"I wanted a glass hummingbird feeder and decided to try this one on my window before springing for some of the more glamorous-looking blown glass ones. I mounted it on my kitchen window, under an awning on the northeast side of the house, not at all expecting anything to happen. A ruby-throated hummingbird found it the very first day!It took some force at first to separate the mounting bracket thing from the feeder itself. In fact, I had to drop it first for it to break loose and detach! Fortunately, nothing broke. I probably could have just soaked it in some hot soapy water and it would have come apart easily.You can't beat glass. I'm just totally getting away from plastic these days...."
1,This is not going to stick on a window.,"There seems to be a stick/no-stick debate here...You know how when you are putting a suction cup on something, you have to press it in and then it kind of pulls away a little and sucks on? Well, there is hard plastic all around the suction cups, making the pushing on part somewhat impossible. If it does go on, it's a very heavy, thick glass feeder, so I doubt it'll stay there."
5,Hummingbirds like it...,Two powerful suction cups attached to a solid transparent vertical frame which is flush with the glass window. 14-oz glass feeder attaches tightly to the red plastic base that has 2 yellow-flower feeders. System is essentially leak-proof. More important than anything else: hummingbirds love it.
1,Great idea....poor execution,"I was really looking forward to this, I love hummingbirds. The first came and I found that the glass part had broken area where it attaches to the suction cup holder. So....I tried again and this time it appeared intact. Until I filled it with the liquid and hung it on the holder and the glass broke out(just a small piece but that's all it takes) in the exact same place as the previous one. Has to be a defect in manufacturing. Was a very big disappointment."
3,"Sturdy, but difficult to clean",The only complaint I have about this product is that it is quite difficult to clean as the fill hole is quite small. I managed to use a straw to scrape off anything that might have stuck to the inside though.. so I am happy with the product for the most part..
1,Hopelessly badly designed,"All of the reviews criticizing the design are correct. The link between the bottle and the suction cup assembly is fatally flawed. On the feeder I received, the glass blob and the runners on the suction cup frame fit together so tightly that there's no way to get the feeder off the frame when it's stuck to a window. Once it's on the window you have to wrestle the entire assembly off to refill, and then go through the tortuous process of remounting the suction cups. Good news/bad news - the feeder is so cheap that it's not worth paying the postage to send it back. Despite the much higher cost, I think the only maker of hummingbird feeders worth buying is Aspects."
1,Too heavy for suction cups,"I've got several different kinds of hummingbird feeders. I bought this one because I like to see the hummingbirds rest. I very carefully followed the *extensive* installation instructions on the suction cups (boiling, finger oils, washing the window), and then hung it up. About 10 seconds later it fell down, smashing the red plastic feeder unit completely. I replaced it with a lighter, all-plastic feeder whose suction cups held it solidly to the window all summer: Woodstream 217 Window Mount Hummingbird Feeder."
2,Wouldn't buy this type again,"I had purchased the Perky Pet Hummingbird Feeder on a different occasion and thought I would get another as the Perky Pet window mounted was such an attraction for hummingbirds. Unfortunately, the Opus model did not adhere to the window very well (and yes we did try using hot water on the suction cups.) I recommend getting the Perky Pet to those who want a no fuss feeder."
3,Hummingbird Feeder,"This feeder is ok. My only complaint on this one is the plastic that encases the suction cups. You can't grip the suction cups because of the plastic around them and the plastic sticks out away from the feeder itself so you can push in to make the suction cups grip. I did get them to grip, but one time it didn't grip well like i thought and the feeder fell off the window. I like the other window feeders better that only have 1 suction cup at the top with no plastic around it."
2,nice idea,The window attachment did not work with this hummingbird feeder. Had to improvise putting it on a pole with some wire.
1,AVOID: BAD DESIGN,The suction cups on this are WAY TOO SMALL for the HEAVY GLASS. I just bought this and HATE IT because of this. I can't mount it to the glass without it sliding. it's totally ridiculous. NOT WORTH IT. I had to put it on the ground because I can't get the suction cups to stick long enough without the whole thing sliding. AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!
1,Design flaw prevents strong attachment to window,Please beware. The two suction cups are attached to a plastic housing that has a major design flaw. There is a plastic lip that prevents the suction cups from getting close enough to the window glass for full suction. I had to take my dremel tool and cut off the plastic lip (about 75% around each suction cup) before this would attach to the window. Be prepared to do the same to get this to stick to the glass.
1,Hummingbird Killed,"Despite the bad reviews, I weighed the positive ones and decided to give this a try. I purchased it for a friend. It is too heavy and it crashed to the ground and killed a hummingbird. I would not recommend this product!"
2,hard to clean,What you can't see from the pictures is the VERY narrow opening to the bottle making this very difficult to clean. Not recommended.
1,Do Not Buy,"This feeder lasted 1/2 hour before the suction cups gave way and the feeder fell to the ground and broke. We have multiple window mounted feeders (suet and seed) which weigh more than this one, and affixed the suction cups correctly. $20 lesson learned - do not buy products from Garden Jewels."
1,Worthless!,Mounted feeder on my window according to directions.Had my doubts since the suction cups seemed too smallfor the weight of the feeder.Turns out I was right. Within an hour the feeder camecrashing down. Glass all over the place.Just inappropriately built.
3,It's OK-Not Great,"The glass bottle is good when the sun is shining on it as plastic tends to turn brittle as it ages. I'm not crazy about the suction cup mounting. It would be nice if the glass bottle could be seperated from the mounting cups. As it is, you have to pry the whole feeder off the glass and then reapply the whole thing. I was able to slide off the feeder on my other one.."
2,Glass not good on window,"After I had spent way too much time putting the Garden Jewel feeder up, a dove hit it and knocked it down, where it broke when it hit the brick at the bottom of the window. As there is always a possibility of a large bird hitting a feeder, I would not recommend the glass feeder. I've had a plastic window feeder for years. It's a bit beaten up, but it is still functioning after several years. The glass feeder didn't last a week."
1,humming bird feeder,"glass is to heavy for size of suction cup. slips down on window. have tried small amt oil on suction cups, still slips."
1,missing parts-don't buy,"I received this otherwise fine unit without the needed suction cups to apply to a window. I contacted the company and they responded, but then, nothing. The feeder is unusable and worthless.I recommend buying nothing from this distributor."
3,Not self feeding?,"Got mine yesterday and cleaned it,soaked the cups as described, put it on the patio door and hummers were all over it. Unfortunately it didn't take long for them to stop coming. When I went out to look at it, the base was almost dry but the bottle was full so that tells me that it is not self feeding. I loosened the bottle from the base just slightly so that the base could fill back up then retightened it and the hummers were back in force until it went dry again.Just have to keep going out and loosening the base from the bottle a couple of times a day."
4,Garden Jewels Window Feeder,"My hummingbirds like this feeder and drink from it often. I also have several other tiny window feeders that they prefer, but they do come to this one too."
2,REALLY Poor Quality Junk But Works (So Far),"I ordered two, and between them I had one good working one. Additionally, the glass arrived broken on one of them (zero shipping damage). It is not tempered glass like Amazon.com states. Mine also didn't look like Amazon.com's pictures.Numerous design and quality problems include defective suction cups, the filler hole in the glass is about 3/8"" (difficult to fill; impossible to clean), the red base has white stress/stretch marks. The bracket design is such that you can't press the suction cups onto the glass well without breaking the plastic.In summary, it is real .... Don't expect it to last, so buy two (one for spare parts).On the positive side, however, it doesn't leak (yet), and the quality of the Perky Pet feeders that I have bought locally is just as bad. The Perky Pet feeders leak (attracting colonies of ants), and they break after 6 months too."
1,Don't buy this feeder!,"Once you understand the directions, then you will know how to mount the suction cup part first to the window. I couldn't understand how you separated the feeder from the mounted part with the suction-cups. When I started to try to pull them apart, I was afraid I was going to break the plastic part. I did get it and it does hold well on the window. The feeder comes off easily now. UPDATE: The plastic part to the mount broke, I only used this feeder 2 months!"
4,Powerful belt sander,"While I've had the oppertunity to use an older model,I cannot compare it to its 12 and 15 amp brothers. I can say that it looks, weighs, and runs like a locomotive. I was very pleased with its power, but am still waiting for Porter-Cable to come out with an 4x24 version. Till then, you can't stop a locomotive."
4,Interesting Book,"This book is about how globalization is *changing* world cultures, for better or for worse. One of Cowen's central arguments is that globalization creates less diversity between cultures but more between individuals. So should we be pro individualism or pro collectivism?His last three chapters on Hollywood, Dumbing Down, and National Culture are the most memorable, and persuasive. I especially enjoyed the chapter on Hollywood. His explanation of how modern cinema is what it is was enlightening.Overall Cowen does what he set out to do; explained how globalization has changed world cultures. More often than not Cowen thinks this has had a net positive effect, but he does argue the other side of the coin. In my opinion Cowen contributes to the globalization vs. anti-globalization debate arguing that it's really one of collectivist culture vs. individual culture."
1,don't bother,"The base for the revolving shoe organizer is not wide enough making the unit prone to tipping. The seperate shoe holders are too close together. Overall, it might be good for womens shoes but not for mens."
1,Shoe tree,"The shoe tree is very disappointing, as it is not well balanced, even with the provided weighting in the base. IT Tips over very easily, and the shoes have to be replaced very carefully and strategically."
4,Excellent History,This book is well organized and very readable. The author conveys the sense of humanity in the periods in discussion.The only reason for four instead of five stars is the author's enthusiasm for the great men of Torah gets the better of him.
5,NAKAI'S PEACE JOURNEY,"I recommend this DVD also for those that seek the journey of inner peace! The songs,the nurishment of the meaning of each song, the sounds of comfort during a days journey! You will not be dissatisfied, i recommend this DVD to all my brothers and sisters that long for PEACE!"
5,"Rebecca Field Jager makes it simple, tasty and fun!","I've had this book for three years now and have rediscovered how perfect the slow cooker is for my family, thanks to Rebecca. I've cooked more than 80 dishes now and they have all been a success with my family and friends. People now think I'm some kind of gourmet chef thanks to this book, and the recipes are all simple, some with only 3 ingredients. Some of my best successes have been Warm Bean Salsa, Carmelized Red Onion Dip, Sticky Wings, Chicken Bites In Thai Peanut Sauce, Tropical Pepper Pot, Thai Beef Curry, Hot & Sour Pork, Chicken Tarragon and Pasta Primavera, to name just a few. This is just a perfect cook book, and is on top of that, it's so much fun to read Rebecca's stories and background info.I am a big fan of How To Make Love and Dinner!"
5,Excellent flavors - not everything tastes like stew,"I have several slow cooker recipe books and this is by far the best. I purchased this for myself and then immediately purchased it as Christmas gifts for all my friends (in 2006), this year (2007) I've made new friends and they are also receiving this great cookbook. The sidebars are humourous and enjoyable little quips. The recipes are great; I've enjoyed nearly everyone I've tried. The flavors that you create in the recipes taste distinct and original, not like everything is just stew. You can't go wrong with this cookbook."
5,"Part cookbook, part marital sex aid","Written with humor and wit, this gives new life to the 1970's crockpot cookery! Recipes are excellent and will make you want to rush to your nearest thrift store and purchase 4 more slo-cookers!"
1,How many recipes to try?,"I actually bought the cookbook for the recipes, I've tried 3 and everyone I've tried has been something I would never make again, and I've had to throw out the majority of each meal. I don't think I will try anymore, too much effort and waste so far. I'm kind of disappointed."
1,worst toy ever,"doesn't stay up, almost immposible to get the bean bags into. this is a total was of money and I know I got it on sale but still feel ripped off."
2,Flimsy,I bought this game for my 2-year-old last Christmas. She has shown no interest in it since then. It falls down all the time and is frustrating for her. Our cat has shown more interest in scratching it.
5,Works great,"I've bought several Acoustic Research AP080 cables previous (same as this but 3 feet) and they've worked great. I needed a 6 foot cable so I got this one and it also works fine. Very flexible, solid connectors."
5,More Punk,This CD is more Punk than what they are doing these days. A heavier faster paced music with allot of energy. It's good stuff.
3,Old-school homages,"2 1/2Powerful only in micro-managed bursts of fuzzed-up, snarling punk, even at less then a half hour the monotonous time signatures begin to take their toll rather quickly. It is only when the band infuses the methodical rawness with more melodic conviction that any song distinguishes itself from the pack, roughly equaling out to 1/4 of this quick assault."
1,First actually carried them? amazing...,"This album must have really signaled to record industries that music was 'shifting', because we fans understood that it was not really, and this album shows that through its weakness to, well, even be good.I listened to this as part of appreciating a variety of band's starts, and the Hives really just, I mean... This was thought to be good, or at least good enough for other deals? As I said, I understand that garage band rock was a big focus, with other bands too as The Vines and even Jet a bit, but this leads to success?Sometimes I have to sit back and remind myself that good comes out of bad, because the band's improved and that's for sure; however, unless you're a Hives fan, or just a music connoisseur like me, then you'll never pick up this album. Simply because there is no point."
2,"Okay Movie, Poor DVD","This is a decent DVD, if you don't mind that 27.9 percent of the original theatrical image has been removed for the DVD exhibition, so that the DVD image fills your entire 4:3 television screen (theatrical aspect ratio - 1.85:1; DVD aspect ratio - 4:3). If you're okay with that, enjoy!"
2,cowboy,if you want this movie in widescreen watch for it on turner classicmovies and copy it...they show it in widescreen often...the tv cut takesaway about half the scope of the picture....
4,Reading lamp,"The lamp is attractive, though a little darker than it looks in the picture. The cord is a bright clear yellowish though, but there is ample room under the base of the lamp to splice in a different color if you are so inclined. The on/off switch is on top of the light and works smoothly.There were a couple of problems when I received the lamp. The handle at the other end of the light is made to screw on as part of the easy assembly, but the threads of the one piece were too small. I had to buy a threaded rod and cut it to size to make it work. It was prett easy for me, but shouldn't have been necessary obviously. Also, the clamping device that holds the light in whatever verticle position you put it in needed some work. If you aren't handy, I wouldn't buy this light, but they way I have it now, it is a pretty good buy. I could have sent it back for another, but no guarantee the next one would have been better and just fixing it was easier."
5,Tracks are...,"Baby, I Don't Cry Over You, I Cover the Waterfront, You Can't Take That Away From Me, Lover Man, Don't Explain, My Man, Billie's Blues, He's Funny That Way, Miss Brown to You, Swing Brother Swing, Mean to Me, Do Nothing Till You Hear From Me."
5,Attention to details yeilds amazing results!,"The Macrina Bakery is one of the best places to go for sweet or savory treats. This book shows why: these folks work hard!If you follow this book like a chemistry text, you should be able to whip up some incredible pastries. Even the simplest recipe is described with careful attention to detail. Don't expect shortcuts or quicktips--be prepared for some hard work. The results are worth it.On the other hand, if you live in Seattle, you could always just let the folks at Macrina do the work for you."
4,Probably the best of the short-lived series,"While I have a fond spot in my heart for the first book of the series, The Secret of the Knight's Sword, it's not the best. Secret Cargo is. All three teenagers are given equal opportunities to shine, and so the books are appealing to all Nancy Drew or Hardy Boys fans. The mystery and its varying conclusions are good as well."
3,Not as easy to install as it should be,"When installing in a shower, the twisting to tighten to road causes the ends to crawl along the wall. Difficult to get both ends to stay where you want them to, you have to push hard against the tendency for the ends to move along the wall as they turn while you twist. But they were the only rod found that fits a 30"" shower stall."
1,Watch Out!,i sliced my finger yesterday trying to set this thing up. The rod has a gap in the middle with a really sharp piece of metal exposed. My hand slipped and I ended up with a 1/2 inch long cut and about 1/4 deep on my finger. Watch out. I taped up the exposed metal with some scotch tape.
3,OK but a bit flimsy,"Easy to install, and looks nice, but not very robust. We installed it in a guest shower and it fell down the first time it was used! Having said that it was easy to re-install - am just hoping it stays in place this time. I would recommend it for low traffic showers, not ones that are used every day."
5,Text books,"This was the first time ordering college textbooks for us, and the book came in early, and in excellent codition. Thanks!"
5,bought it straight from Winard,"Great Album-- I saw his band live at the Jazzfest today, and I was truly amazed and blown away by the talent... so after the set I bought this album straight from him. This jazz band is unique and set apart from others, because it has the energy that other bands lack."
3,"Not great, but decent","I bought this for my 2 year old because everyone else in our family uses down comforters and she was feeling left out. She enjoys it very much! But the fabic is very rigid. It actually crackles when you move around under it! She's too little to know the difference so it works fine for her bed, I am just glad I didn't get this one for myself! It's a little thin for my preference too. But for the price, it works."
4,super classic mall horror,"This books reads like a surreal slasher movie. A group of people get stuck in a mall. They all represent a different stereotype. There's the goth, the home boy, etc. all the stereo types are hilarious except for the home boy or the thug or the b-boy or whatever you want to call him. Art never does these kids justice. Mellick focuses on how corny these types of characters are without going into how hilarious they can be. I grew up with these kind of kids to I have a real affection for them.Otherwise the book is incredible. A real bizarro classic.The ending is dreamy and poetic."
3,A quick read but worth the time.,"People that are 2D cardboard cutout stereotypes are trapped in a 3D mall and are unable to leave. They try but for some reason can't bring themselves to walk out the doors. Slowly things get more bizarre(o). The 2D people, in the 3D mall head into 4D strangeness, that by the end seems almost normal.This was an interesting read, (equally strange, but fitting artwork also litters the pages throughout) that kind of makes you think. Along with, wondering about yourself and just where you would fit in with this gaggle of ""paint by the numbers."" Would you go along with them and their zaniness? Or would you be Interesting enough to be different (painting outside the lines) and not be a mindless Lemming-Sheep?A quick read but worth the time."
2,Very Simplistic Writing,"I was very disappointed in this story. Based on reviews that I had read I was eagerly awaiting a surrealistic nightmare peppered with poigniant social commentary in a style that I had yet to be exposed to.The book reads like a moderately talented high schooler's short story. This proves that being able to string sentences together in a cognizant way does not a great author make.I found the dialogue very simplistic and assuming, and the narrative was boring in contrast to the psychotic events taking place. I wish there had been a more enticing use of language and maybe a little depth to the characters.The story ends in a fantasy, but none of the questions ever get answered. Why is the mall menstruating? What does it all mean? Why couldn't anybody leave?I feel like the author had a clear message in his mind that just didn't come across to me"
5,All the Mundanes Must Die,"What does it mean to be unique?That's a question this book poses. It's a common question, and whenever someone addresses such well-known issues, they run the risk of boring their audience with rehashed ideas and no new insight.Luckily, the Menstruating Mall is neither boring nor devoid of fresh ideas. Carlton Mellick III often writes about such universal concepts as rebellion and individuality, but reading his books never feels like travelling the same territory that other such themed books do.CM3 uses a simple writing style in many of his books, including this one. Coupled with the crudely drawn (and hilarious) illustrations by Food Fortunata, this book's style laughs at ""sophisticated"" literature. It's totally awesome.Like all good art, this book presents more questions than answers. It's up to you, the reader, to find your own answers."
2,Interesting Premise,"Oh Carlton, I feel like you could have taken what began as a very interesting premise and done so much more with it. Unfortunately, that is not what happened. The ending was almost the equivalent of an insanity plea in the absurd way that it tried to wrap up all that had come before. And those 'illustrations'? At first I found them mildly entertaining because they were so rude and disgusting, but after the third or fourth it was like being an hour into the routine of a stand up comic who only knows fart jokes.I thought you really had it going on in 'Satan Burger'. Perhaps weird-freaky-semi-lucid just doesn't interest me much anymore."
4,"Ah, the future of literature at last","This, the newest book by cult-classic writer Carlton Mellick, does not dissapoint. For those familiar with Mellick's work, this will be another strange, hilariously twisted and indulgent treat to lose yourself in, and for those new to his work, it's a slap in the face that makes you think ""why haven't I read every single book this man has written?!?!?"" The characters are as vivid and original as any he has created, and the combination of satire and social commentary mix perfectly without a hint of preaching or pretention. Recommended for anyone anywhere who enjoys new and interesting works of literature that have as much substance as they do style."
5,A Masterwork,This book signifies what Carlton Mellick's writing is all about. Taking an absolutely off-the-wall premise and building a highly intelligent story upon that framework. One of his best novels. Award-winning horror author Brian Keene even references this book (and features Mr. Mellick himself) in his own novella Take The Long Way Home. The Menstruating Mall is a cult classic in it's own right. Buy this book and try to prove me wrong!
4,"Funny, Weird, & Really Good","With Menstruating Mall, Carlton Mellick III takes social satire, mixes in some sci-fi action, and smears the whole thing with a disgusting goo. The language is simple and easy to read, but I think the point is to tell a story as simply as possible, without all the literary fluff. With this genre, the format works. Get in, paint a picture, and get out. The imagery will not soon leave your mind. As far as bizarro fiction goes, Carlton is one of the best at creating outrageous stories, in strange worlds, with underlying exaggerated pokes at how real life is or may become. Take a chance and read something different that will challenge your idea of what storytelling can and should be."
2,Pushing to the front,"I guess I was expecting to read something else, so the book did not impress me all that much. Perhaps I should have read up on what it was about before picking it up. I found it to be a motivational how to book, but it seemed dated. I put it away from now because it did not speak to me for what I needed. Perhaps I will finish it and give a different opinion."
5,Touched by Vietnam? This is a must read.,"This book really moves. Taylor Eubank flew 200 combat missions in Southeast Asia--all unarmed. He was a member of a small group of American servicemen to go into combat unarmed. This makes for exciting flying and exciting reading. The tales of derring-do and night flights and unarmed photo runs over Hanoi are funny and poignant and, well, gripping.I could not stop reading ""The Longest Run,"" which recounts missiles (SAMs) coming from all around while the mission required the aircraft to fly straight and level. Try putting that down!This is a really good read. If you or yours have been touched by the Vietnam conflict in any way, you need to read this book."
1,"Great cuts, bad seal, P-C service takes forever","I bought this saw relying on the P-C name and reputation. The tool arrived in an undamaged package. It really looked like it was very well engineered and manufactured until... Until I made the first 1/4"" angle steel cut. The cut was perfect but the next morning I found oil all over the base of the saw. Well, it's my own fault, I trusted P-C name and not the reviewer above that documented the issue with the seal. So I decided to fix it by bringing the saw to the authorized P-C service center. It took them 4 weeks just to look at it and now they are telling me that it will take another 15-30 days for the parts to arrive. So I don't have my saw for a month already and I don't know when I get it back and how long the seal will last again. If you want to have no problems stay away from this P-C saw otherwise be prepared for the oil leaks!"
5,Much better than an abrasive blade chop saw,"Clean, fast square cuts that don't get hot. Could use a faster vice."
3,Average anatomy book,"If you want a male anatomy reference book this one is for you. If you need female anatomical references, it's not very helpful. There are no comparative views of male and female forms. This is a major drawback, considering that men and women have different exterior shapes despite the similarities of their skeletal structures. All of the anatomical illustrations are of male standing poses and each section of the book has a small thumbnail illustrations to illustrate what effects movement have on the underlying musculature."
2,Mediocre at best,"I've used better books. There isn't much to learn from this book: lack of variety in poses and angles, stiff poses, and in general very unaesthetic too and the muscles are too over-emphasized by the dark lines everywhere. The women here look like men, and good artists know that male and female bodies should be taken with different approach. Spend your money elsewhere."
2,Disappointment,The book did not contain as many angle images of the anatomy as I had hoped. This is a thin book that lacks a lot of variety of art work. There are better books available.
3,The Human Figure Drawing Book,"We purchased this for our daughter who is taking an art class. She liked having a variety of figures and body parts to study.From a parents' perspective, most of the drawings were done in a manner that wasn't too explicit. There are a few that we would have preferred not having in the book, but generally most of depictions were appropriate for a high school art student."
1,The Human Figure: An Anatomy for Artists,"I bought this book for a drawing class. The book has nice detailed drawings of most figure types, but the four female pages were removed from my used copy. Be selective of your seller. I sent an e-mail to the seller and no response. Otherwise, I recommend this book for learning to draw figures."
5,Gripping Story,"Wonderful, real-life story of war and all its vagaries. This fellow wanted to strike back at the Nazis, and he certainly did by volunteering for the British army and becoming a parachute commando."
5,"Porter-Cable 362VS 4"" x 24"" - excellent machine","I am new to the world of sanders but when I purchase something I do research and then get the best! This sander performed great! Although I did purchase the graphite sanding thing-a-ma-bob, I did not need to install it during my first project of refinishing a real abused floor. ..I never had to increase the sanders speed to the 7 on its dial... used 5 and that was excellent.Tracking was easy to adjust and stayed where you put it.All-in-all I would definitely recomend this sander as one that will not only do the job, but do it for years to come!RAD"
5,Incredible +,"If you need one of these, put on your knee pads and get ready for a ride. I often build stages for plays and had a 60'x40' stage on 4 levels which was going to be covered with dancers: no bouncing or tripping allowed. I got a PC 362VS from Amazon and it smoothed 2400 square feet both quickly and effectively. Wear ear plugs and bring along extra belts as this muthuh is a professional tool, but anyone who has a serious project should consider getting one."
2,"""poor""ter cable design","I own one of the larger solid surface shops in the Washington DC market. I'm a big fan of all Porter Cable routers(we have over 40) but the design on the wisper series belt sanders(we have 12) is by far the worst so called improvement they could have made. It is quieter, however they put the bearing for the fan that cools the motor outside the housing where it is subject to every particle of dust that passes through the machine and into the dust bag. We have a life of only 2 or 3 weeks of reasonable use before we have to have it serviced for a bearing replacement. If there were other issues I might consider abuse of some sort, but that one bearing is costing me a fortune. Also the fitting for the dust bag could use some type of ""O"" ring to keep dust from blowing from the poor connection from the tool to the dust bag. I will be talking to my tool repair guy to see if there is a better design from another manufacturer."
4,4 x 24 belt sander,"Out of the box ........good balance and good access for dust collection, but I noted after several moments of use that the front idler (for the sanding belt) was significantly out of round. The unit wobbled noticeably and sanded accordingly. I called their service # and after 3 tries with different people found someone who thought they understood the problem. Initially they recommended my taking it to a service center......but I refused and instead asked for a replacement idler, which they agreed to. The first box sent contained a drive belt???? Not sure how that was arrived at. Another series of calls eventually produced the correct part. I changed out the idler and the unit now works fine. The defective idler appears to have been cast but never turned or trued up. Too bad something simple casts a negative shadow on a otherwise good tool.Rosewood"
1,Worst belt sander,"I own a 3 X 21 Porter Cable belt sander and it is by far the worst belt sander I have ever owned. It's heavy, bulky, case get's very hot after only 8 - 10 minutes of sanding. The dust bag is constantly in the way (you can't see what your doing and it bumps into everything close by. The power cord has a natural tendancy to get [pulled] into the rear of the belt guard. That takes quite a bit of time to un-jamb. I DOES collect dust a bit better than others I've used. I have previously owned Black & Decker, Craftsman and DeWalt."
1,Not authentic.,"This was not and original creed item.Item is a fake. A little disappointed in amazon.I will only be purchasing creed from an authorized dealer from now on.The old saying of ""too good to be true"" certainly applies here."
2,CREED GREEN IRISH TWEED,"I purchased this product after reading the reviews. The product is purpoted to last for 24 hrs and supposed to have great sillage. I can confirm that this is not true at all. The product lasts around 5 hrs and loses sillage after that. Definately not 24 hrs. I tried multiple ways to apply this unusally expensive cologne 3-4 sprays on the neck and wrist/ on clothing. However, GIT does have a good scent (thats why 2 stars). I would rather use a heavy load of Axe body spray than GIT...matter of fact the Axe got me compliments not GIT."
5,I am hooked,"Well I blind bought this cologne from all the recommendations of my buddies. I have had it for almost a year and the only thing i can tell you is that this bottle is worth of $150 or however it is now. Some people say it smells like Cool water, yes indeed it does since the creator of cool water copied GIT, but when it settled down, GIT is way way way better than Cool water. It is a cologne that would make people turn their heads and ask what is that good smell...Creed GIT = one of the best."
1,Questioning the authenticity of the product........,"I have used House of Creed Eau-de Toilette and other products from this fine old company for some years now. But the veracity of Amazon as a authorized seller or re-seller seems very troubling. Specifically, I question the authenticity and origin / source of Amazons supplier. For a product made in France for centuries it seems very odd the there is a label on the bottom of the bottle itself in Arabic script. A bottle Creed Green Irish Tweed would normally retail at $270.00(us),even with an amazing discount, it seems difficult to believe that AMAZON could be selling new,fresh stock for $139.67, and possibly make a profit. I believe what we are all buying is old, liquidated, foreign export stock. What is that old adage,"" If it seems too good to be true it probably is"". Such a shame on Amazon, and it seems a gullible shame on me for trying to save a dollar This is the last time for me!"
1,Not the Original...,"I am a great fan of Irish Tweed, this time I tried it from Amazon due to low price but bad luck ... I got a fake one looks exacty like original but smells fake and not lasts long..I suggest to buy this from CREEDBOUTIQUE.COM if you want original one.."
4,Good perfume,"I liked Green Irish Creed. The only problem is it's not long lasting as compared to the other perfumenamed ""houbigant"" that I used. But for the time lasts it smells really good."
5,Terrific Repair Manual!,This is a terrific step-by-step manual that anyone can follow. I have used it on two different washers. It is accurate and has saved me a lot of money on repair bills.
1,Big Mistake to Purchase this Junk.,"This case is an overpriced nothing. It offers very minimal protection if any due to lack of padding. It has no handle, no strap, no belt loops. It is made overseas and not good for much of anything. Do yourself a favor and click away from this page...fast!"
5,I've discovered Jack Liffey!,"This is the first of John Shannon's Jack Liffey mysteries I've read, though I see it's the fourth book in the series. It gave me a fascinating glimpse into the Vietnamese community of Orange County, LA, as well as introducing me to a central character I immediately want to more about. Jack Liffey is no super-hero, but a decent sort of guy trying to do his best in a crazy world (and some aspects of Liffey's LA are definitely crazy!). John Shannon is a great writer who keeps the reader interested throughout, and I can't understand why he isn't much better known. 'The Orange Curtain' is highly recommended."
3,Catskills,The only reason I bought this dvd is because it was filmed in the catskills where my family own a house. The area it was filmed is beautiful but the movie is not that great.I was an extra when they filmed this but I guess I got cut from the finally print.Oh well it might have been better if they kept my scene in it!!
3,Hey now!,"I was on the set of this movie while it was being filmed. That was one of the best experiences of my life. Christian Slater is an incredible actor and a total sweetie. This film, however, was not one of his best. But it was good."
1,One of the Most Awful movies I have ever seen,"I generally stick to books when writing reviews, but this movie was so bad I feel a need to warn the public. I generally like Christian Slater movies. Like Johnny Depp, Slater often chooses off-beat movies which I enjoy. This one is certainly off-beat but it is also a piece of crap. Usually with a movie that is this bad, I simply turn it off and accept the fact that I wasted my money. But every now and then you come across a movie that is SO BAD you stick with it just to see if it can get any worse. I'm not sure if it got any worse but it certainly didn't get any better. A negative 5 stars for me."
3,"not great, but...","Scoundrel's Wife is a sometimes meandering, occasionally confusing little ""period piece"" indie film. The cast is generally good, and Tatum O'Neal's powerful screen presence is worth the price of admission, but it's still a long way from a 5 star film."
2,WWII fears of German supporters in coastal water,"The story is very slow paced with the bad lieutenant, the bad priest, the bad ""doctor"", the bad daughter, the bad Chinese killing love interest, the bad son, the bad crowd, the prejudicial town folks with a thirst for blood and the high command wanting someone to hang... Who are you going to love? Not until the last few minutes do you find any redeeming qualities in; the Mother, daughter, son, priest and the doctor. The love interest is weak and the ""hidden secrets"" characters face are lacking in support. The opening confusion that was to set the scene added more confusion than hinting at what was to follow. Read other reviews but this film is bad."
5,"Great Acting with a Wonderful Sense of ""Place""","I was fortunate to have seen this film when it came out, and I will not repeat the very good reviews it got at the time. I will say, though , that the acting is superb (it is worth price of the DVD just to watch what Tim Curry does with his character)and the film gives a wonderful sense of Place without depending on cilchs about the currently fashionable Cajun culture. I would also like to complement the writing: the characters are engaging and there are some surprising plot twists - not the kind that are out of character or anachronistic, but the kind that make us realize just how little we were ever taught about this era in American history. Highly recommended."
3,"My Copy Fell Apart, And Not From Use","This broad overview of comics written in the 70s has long since been superceded by other and better sources of info. The examples of European comics are still of interest-- lots of Peanuts and Donald Duck and Marvel panels in German, for those interested. But the production of the volume was shoddy-- reproductions frequently washed out, and the ""perfect"" binding anything but. If you can find an intact copy, it's a miracle-- thus the high price here on Amazon, I imagine. If you need another source of info for a paper on comics, it's useful as a citation, but otherwise it's dispensible."
3,not nearly as good as I'd remembered,"Putting aside the very mediocre video and audio quality, I found, 25 years after having first enjoyed this series, the episode plots predictable and amateurish (often even downright silly) and the acting very uneven."
5,Finally!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is great news! I watched every episode, including the ones on Showtime.THe show was just a work of art!Laverne and Shirley was one of the reasons it was cancelled by CBS."
2,"I thought I liked this, but now ?","I watched this when it was on TV many years ago. I thought I liked this show, but now as I watch it again --- the one hour segments are not that great.Houseman is great as a stern professor of law. The 'law students' are just OK; and plots are weak and not exciting.note - I am not a lawyer or law student (and I never was one). In fact, I don't even like lawyers, so i can not explain what drew me to this TV show in the first place!"
3,"HERE AT LAST, BUT POOR QUALITY!","I am thankful to Shout for coming out with this series. I am very disappointed, however, about the quality of the discs. Shout acknowledges that there are problems with Disc 3 (see [...]- which is a great website). The problem is that the voice is not in sync with the video. I have encountered this problem on most of the discs - not just on Disc 3. Even though the problem is annoying, I am still happy to have the series on DVD."
5,Paper chase,I loved this show & was thrilled when Showtime picked it up after cancellation but it has been years since viewing. It's a bit dated butthe terror for students in law school endures the wrath of Professor Kingsfield.If you like law or have been to law school you'll love this show. It was too intellectual for primetime television.
4,Beautiful,"Es una buena demostración de la música indígena americana, en manos de su principal exponente. Sin embargo, tiende a tornarse repetitivo en oportunidades. Buen disco. Sin embargo recomiendo fuertemente su colaboración con Peter Kater, como las obras maestra de Nakai."
2,A slanted POV,"A biographer can approve or dissaprove of your subject, but this is a very unsympathetic and often inaccurate portrait of one of the history's most influential leaders. This authors' ""Great Harry"" displays a great admiration for Henry VII's first wife. His ""Bloody Mary"" is full of rationalizations for the excesses (and sometimes psychotic behavior) of his eldest daughther, who sent more people to torturous deaths in almost every year of her reign than Elizabeth did throughout her lengthy monarchy. While most of what is documented here is accurate, the analysis, in light of much evidence that is ignored, is a portrait that is more often mispreresentational than not. The writing is good and lively, which is unusual for a genre that tends to be stuffy, but for a truer understanding of one of history's most powerful rulers (and survivors), you'll want to also read other books for a more accurate portrayal of a complex character."
2,A Very Difficult Read,"I have read a couple of her books, Mistress Anne and Bonnie Prince Charlie, and I enjoyed them. So when I got The First Elizabeth was extremely disappointed. Having read dozens of books on Elizabeth and knowing something about the subject, this book does not really paint an accurate picture in my opinion. She writes more on gossip and rumours without giving acutal facts. There are accurate statements but they are not in evidence on the whole. She also tended(IMO) to side more with Mary Tudor, who was not as intelligent or politically astute as Elizabeth. She gave the feeling that Mary was just misunderstood. The author seemed to relish in court gossip especially from Elizabeth's maids of honour. I would recommend Mary M. Luke's, Gloriana: The Years Of Elizabeth I, and Alison Weir's, The Life of Elizabeth I before I would recommend this book."
5,Hail Britainia,"A great book about a Queen whose story reads more like ""The Godfather"" than you'd guess.Elizabeth I, thrust onto the throne while her country was still in the midst of it's centuries-long emergence from Roman rule, turned England into Great Britain through a heady mixture of guile, guts, and British steel(How's that for rhetoric?).It's a great book, as are most of Erickson's titles."
3,East kids classic,"This video is another of the east side kids series. The video and audio is fair, better then some ."
5,Absolute Bargain,"I remembered these old movies from my childhood. The price was phenominal and I got three features in one package. The clarity was fantastic. Apparently, some DVD players may not support the color option but I am extemely peased with my transaction nonetheless."
3,Use caution if ordering,"I watched this movie once and then sold it. The special effects were done well based on the time they were produced but the screenplay was dull and did not inspire me. If you collect these movies, go for it... otherwise save your money."
3,Something wrong with DVD aspect ratio,"This was a favorite movie from my childhood. The Harryhausen special effects were awesome for the time, and are still impressive. However, there is something wrong with a the aspect ratio on this DVD. The actors all have long narrow heads, the cars are short and overly tall, etc. The VHS tape is much better in this regards. The DVD does feature ""The Harryhausen Chronicles"" which alone is worth the price of this DVD. Too bad they could have made the DVD where people look normal."
3,See Washington and duck!,"This 1950's sci-fi classic should not be reviewed for the skills of its actors, although Hugh Marlowe certainly pursues all the ernestness of a dedicated scientist who feels guilty for exposing all of manking to destruction. Morris Ankrum is included as a general as usual. While the direction of Fred Sears is inconsistent and the pace of the movie drags a bit, the special effects of Ray Harryhausen are excellent and Washington will not see such destruction again until Independence Day or Mars Attacks. In fact the Washington Monument is almost as played with as in Mars Attacks, although there is no Cub Scout troop underneath. Let's face it, with the S/fx sophistication of the present day, this movie appears dated. But in 1957, E/vFS was the epitome of space invasion opuses. The scenes of invader proclamations being broadcast around the world in various languages are hoots."
3,Earth verses Flying Saucers,"This film is one of the real 50-60's classic si-fi flicks. As a young child - it was one of the most terrifying flicks of all time. Especially after the ""Roswell Incident"" - if you are from a later era, you should take this with ""tongue in cheek""; however, if you were young during this era, you would have been glued to your seats. A real top notch ""B"" thriller! - B. Neely, M.D., Neurosurgery, Austin, Texas"
4,great stuff,I have always been a great fan of this gentleman's work. Good to see attention(long overdue) being given to this innovative master animator.I was facinated to learn the involvement of his parents in his early projects and it was heartening to see the unconditonal support they gave him. Would have liked to see different documentaries on each disc but it would appear the dvds were not meant to be part of a set oiriginaly. Technically (sp?) great stuff with some truly corny acting.Thanks once more for a great product!
4,"""Take Cover!""","Look up and look out....these aliens mean business.Directed by Fred F. Sears and starring Hugh Marlowe (Dr. Russell A. Marvin) and Joan Taylor (Carol Marvin), the 1956 release has solid special effects that features a number of iconic landmarks crashing down due to the flying saucers essentially being destructive Frisbees.Dr. Marvin coordinates a project to send rockets into Earth's orbit, which will ultimately assist with the exploration of the universe. But the rockets begin to disappear and it turns out that some wily aliens are causing the turmoil in space and are also itching for a fight with the Earthlings.The power of the aliens is incredible and the Marvin's may end up the only people left alive after the one-sided brutality is over. With the focus on bogus negotiating ploys, sneak attacks and the unleashing of ultimate weapons of mass destruction, the movie masterfully mixes elements of the Cold War into the Sci-Fi thriller."
2,Conforms to expectation in every regard...,"EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS(USA - 1956 - black and white)Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Theatrical soundtrack: MonoA scientist (Hugh Marlowe) struggles to convince authorities of an imminent alien invasion after he's contacted by sinister beings who threaten the entire planet.Typical 1950's B-movie fodder, with stock characters and a predictable narrative arc, directed with humdrum efficiency by Fred F. Sears (THE GIANT CLAW). Best remembered for Ray Harryhausen's animated flying saucers, though the effects are compromised by an obvious low budget. Routine stuff."
1,Ray Harryhausen Gift Set,"Cannot do a review, as sent back Refused, Return to Sender, because was extremely late getting here and because vendor and I had e-mail ""words."" Will not purchase from him again -- not EVER. One star is for ""presumed"" okay oldies.Cecy"
2,You would be shocked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This movie isn't to impossible. Starting with a content that is more believable than you could ever think. Focusing on an event which possibly be truer than we can consider. However man could not controll situations that are above our limited way of total and complete controll. (But the movie has good has good story line until the end.) MAN is not a dominate factor as we are led to believe.
1,black-n-white billed as color,Don't waste your money if you're looking for a colorized version of these movies. Three of the five are black and white. What a disappointment!
1,Never Received,I wrote the Seller and Amazon because I was sent the wrong movie. I never received and answer from either one of them!
4,Earth vs.The Flying Saucers,"This is one of the few really good 1950s science fiction movies. Very good special effects for the time. Great theme and plot. Excellent emphisis on, and explaination of scientific theory on atomic and gravity propulsion systems; some becomming a reality today. This movie hits hard because many of us do believe that there is a real possibility of an alien invasion from outer space, or creatures from another dimension. Also see the first ""flat screen"" T.V on board the alien spacecraft.Check out this vintage flick. you will enjoy it."
3,Box Set Offers Nothing New,"A few months ago, Ray Harryhausen told an interviewer that his 50's black and white classics were being colorized, and he was happy with the quality. Amazon lists these 3 films as being in color, but they are NOT (Supplemental material is in color). The booklet contains exerpts from Harryhausen's Animated Life book, so there is no new material here for Harryhausen fans. Since these three films are already included in the Sci-Fi Harryhausen box set, I am curious as to why this set was released at all. If you don't have these films, I highly recommend them as an example of the brilliant stop-motion animation work produced during Harryhausen's early career. For rabid fans, nothing new."
4,Great movie....Cromachoice not so great,"There were a few good flying saucer /invasion movies made in the past andthis is one of the good one. Like war of the worlds this movie is quiteentertaining and is as good as the first time i saw it. Never did complain about the black /white version but now in color its even better. People who are used to complexed cgi and buckets of blood might be dissapointed, as this is a movie driven by a story and not a special effect disguised as a movie."
3,Another Classic's; Worthy to be in your shelves.,"Just as I enjoy the Legendary Monster Series Collection of Harryhausen, I have this one as well, not as great as the Legendary Monster Series, but just as enjoyable.Can't beat the old camera tricks on these movies, for any avid fan of old movies, don't forget to have this one as well."
3,interesting movie for the era,"I liked the movie as it created a thrilling atmosphere with the humble cinema facilities at that time.the ""lusty"" professor added nice mood to the movie.For the lovers of the old movies, this would be worth to watch."
4,Harryhausen Sci-Fi Collection,"This is a great collection of the old Harryhausen movies. Especially when you can get is on sale :) Both B&W; and color, these films represent the best of Ray's Sci-Fi work. The special effects are the stop motion type Ray is famous for. And while the younger crowd may find these old fashion, those of us who grew up with these films will not be disappointed. Like the Saturday Matinee's of oold, just sit back and enjoy.Jim"
5,Who doesn't love Harryhousen?,"A masterpiece of then cutting edge Sci-Fi animation by the Master Of The Art, Ray Harryhousen. A must have classic to add to a Sci-Fi buffs collection..."
3,"Pretty Intelligent & No Nonense, But Lacks Excitement","This was fairly interesting and nicely low-key for a 1950s sci-fi flick....which usually means one thing: hysterical women shrieking and screaming. Well, there's none of that nonsense here. Ray Harryhausen's special-effects were lauded and justifiably so for his era, but you can imagine how they look today 50 years later! They look pretty primitive.The acting is respectable considering the three stars - Hugh Marlow, Joan Taylor and Donald Curtis - are anything but ""stars."" I do think the story could have used a bit of humor to spice it up a bit, but you can't always get everything.At least this one was one ""flying saucer movie"" that had some intelligence. It might have had too much, because it had very little excitement."
4,Enjoyable mid-50s sci-fi flick,"Ray Harryhausen did well with his special effects despite the obvious limited budget. The script and setting are typical mid-50s look, but the movie goes along well, particularly in the latter half.I love these old classics from the 40s, 50s and 60s, and considering all of the blood, gore and shoot-em-up they show today, if I had children, I would much rather have them watch these old movies in the days before Hollywood deemed it necessary to throw about 100 gallons of ketchup per film.This movie won't win any awards, but it wasn't intended to. It was intended to be entertaining and to make you think ""what if,"" and it does just that.With all of the corruption going on in Washington today, what happened to it in this movie has probably entered the thoughts of a lot of people in this country."
1,"FAKE ""widescreen"" ruins several titles!","Although I am a fan of all the films in this collection, and the quality of reproduction is good, I wound-up trading away three of these five films in anger! ""It Came from Beneath the Sea"", ""Earth vs. the Flying Saucers,"" and ""Mysterious Island"" (none of which were originally filmed in a widescreen process) are all presented in a FAKE ""widescreen"" which does nothing more than essentially cut-off the tops and bottoms of the films as originally presented. Thus--watching them is like watching the originals through a mail-slot! As a purist, I consider this to be sacrilege, and my purchase of this collection essentially a complete waste of money! (Fortunately--though wearing out--I still have my VHS copies of these films, which are much closer to the original film ratio.)"
2,"good effects, bad acting and script","although ray harryhausen's special effects are still amazing to this day, the plot is dull and the acting is simply awful. worth watching only for the genius of harryhausen"
2,Good,I love Ci-Fi of the 50's and 60's for me it's fantastic because remind me my fascinating childhood that I still haveLeo Rojas
2,Not very good,"I saw this recently, in fact it was the only Harryhausen fim I hadn't seen.Total garbage, put me to sleep."
2,Disappointed,I loved the title song when I used to hear it every day on the radio during my work commute in 1972. This is the lowest quality Roger Whittaker production in my collection. The recordings could have been made out in an open field as the cover illustration indicates.
4,Truly a new way.,"Based on ancient bonsai techniques from India and Southeast Asia, and new techniques from Europe and the United States, this book explains how to grow bonsai trees from seed and get great results in fraction of the time. (In about five years, as opposed to twenty or more for the traditional Japanese bonsai techniques.) And no one else will know the difference! Highly recommended."
5,A Five Star Single,"I gave this CD five stars but what I really meant was to give the single Worldwide Watchdog Peepshow five stars. I can't recommend the CD as a whole since that's the only song I've heard (ahem... are you listening Amazonians, I'm saying I want some audio clips). Anyway, I got a hold of the single on the FunkingFusion two CD sampler set which I can and do highly recommend. Its sort of a dubby chilled out slightly reggae influenced version that's good for lounging to."
3,"porter and cable sander 4 x 24 ""","this sander does what it is supposed to do, rough in jobs and some finishing touches. the variable speed is a joke. you'll need full speed. the dust bag and 'l' tube connecting it to the top of the sander leaves much to be desired. it clogs easily, and eventually the bag does not fill b/c the shavings collect mysteriously izsomewhere in the sander itself. vacuuming it does help, but short of disassembling the unit, i do nopt know how one would unclog this. it would be especially nice if parts were available for this, like the dust bag and the 'l' connector as well. so far, i've found neither at home depot or lowe's. must one buy a new model to get a dust bag?"
4,70s Chop Socky at its GREATEST,"Martial arts film is a beautiful genre. Seagal, Van Damme, they've ruined it, made it into the ""action movie"", which [is bad].Sister Street Fighter is a VERY good 70s martial arts film, starring Sue Shiomi. It is very stylish, with good cinematography, and well-choreographed fight scenes. This is some of the last and greatest kung-fu filmmaking. Sonny Chiba has about 3 fight scenes (he is not the star), all of which rock. Your basic kidnap/revenge plot... there are FIGHTING AMAZONS...!!!! Not a waste of money, despite what that narcoleptic guy said."
3,This is one Lethal Lady!,"I first saw the beautiful and deadly protegee of the great Sonny Chiba in Chiba's brutal karate cult-classic,THE STREETFIGHTER.Though her appearance was brief,it was certainly cool to see her pit her skills against Chiba.She now comes into her own as the lethal SISTER STREETFIGHTER.Although in no way connected to THE STREETFIGHTER films series by story or character,(Sonny Chiba co-stars in the film but not as Terry Tsurugi,The Streetfighter.)it gives Sue Shiomi a chance to shine all on her own,but of course with a little help from Chiba.This movie has a few dull,even awkward moments but with spell-binding action scenes that wll keep your eyes glued to the screen.Overall,I found SISTER STREETFGHTER to be an entertaining film featuring who I consider to be one of the best as the most underrated female martial arts film stars.I also recommend the film,DRAGON PRINCESS,with another entertaining performance by Sue Shiomi..."
2,BORING!!,"Well, honestly I fell asleep about half way thru the movie. It was given to me as a present so I didn't waste my money. You are better of buying something else. This was the first time I've seen a Sonny Chiba movie, and I was not impressed."
5,Trim saw blade,The 120 tooth blade handles 1/2 inch Russian Birch plywood like a laser through butter. I use the blades exclusively in cabinet making and find that this 4 1/2 blade is the best for clean precise cuts. Always remember to score your cuts with a utility knife first and there is virtually no rip out.If you are cutting plexiglass or plastics always use a sharp and very clean blade. Cleaning with one of the new 'orange' based producsts is best.Remember to unplug the saw when doing any adjustments.
5,Porter cable saw blade,"I have used Porter Cable products fo over 30 years and have never hand any problems. Their blades are very good--properly tooled as yould would expect. aaai did not shop anywhere else because Amazon usually have the best prices, not to mention the best service."
5,Works Fine,"I used it for Marmoleum Click Flooring panels, which are rigid linoleum/cork/HDF panels about 3/8"" thick. Clean cuts, worked fine."
3,very very stupid shipping,"it was idiotic to send a thin, light, 4 inch piece of steel in a box so that it would take forever to arrive (supposedly it's been sitting in Trenton 15 minutes away for 3 weeks...check the tracking) AND IT STILL HASN'T ARRIVED!!! It could have been sent efficiently and cheaply in an envelope by 1st class and I would have gotten it in a few days.GRANTED, after I complained 3 times and wasted WAY OVER 10 bucks worth of time (that's the cost of the blade) you kindly sent a replacement. But I would have rather the problem been prevented in the first place and I will think twice before I order those kind of items again. thanks for asking,don"
4,Really good songs,"This cd has really good songs, style mucical corresponds to the beginning of the 70s that incorporates the use of synthesizers of the time to provide a very nice sound and appropriate to each song, the sound quality is very good, the finished product is excellent, no defects or any protrusions that could cause injury."
2,Flawed book on an obscure topic,"The author of this book, Alexander Lawrence, had an infatuation with the French aristocracy. Lawrence goes way out of this way to demonstrate to his readers his command of French. He also dwells on how great the commanders in the French Navy and Army were and the long and storied noble lineages that they came from. Unfortunately, if you're interested in the Battle of Savannah, there are not too many books to choose from, so you'll be forced to wade through this volume if you want to learn something about the battle. The description of the battle itself is well-written and informative. The parts leading up to it and the end, particularly on what happened to this or that commander during the French Revolution were long and not relevant to topic of the book."
4,Very nice looking,"This is very nice looking at a reasonable price. The base could use a little more weight to it. Other than that, the quality was very good."
4,Great,"These filters were purchased in lieu of inoperable cells in an electronic air cleaner. These worked great, but required pretty frequent changes. Probably not the fault of the filter: our house is under a huge tree and we have two basset hounds."
4,Good Bag,"Good, durable bag for your Volkl rackets. Side pocket is great for keys, wallet, cell phone, etc."
1,Basic,There are not a lot of good books on World War One. This is not one of them.It is about as informative and interesting as a high school history text.
4,Outstanding work!,"An outstanding work on the part of Winter. Truly the best book I have read on WWI. It is better, by far, then Keegan's Face of Battle for telling it like it was in the trenches. Winter's insight and opinions are as eagerly sought as the details he constantly unfolds for us. My only objection was the use of so much British slang, perhaps a dictionary of terms for us Americans would have helped. Also, like most works in English, and true to the saying that the victors write the history, there is virtually no reference to the suffering of the Germans and none for the Americans."
1,"Buy private, forget the stuper saver shipping","I recently purchased the 4' version. It's a great ladder, and shipping was fast; like 5 or 6 business days. I ordered the 6' version on the 14th of January. From Amazon LLC. It said it was in stock, and estimated delivery was about 2 weeks out with free super saver shipping. That would take us close to the end of January. I checked the status a minute ago and my estimated delivery is now changed to February 20th. That is 37 days from the date of purchase. What a joke. For the couple bucks I might have saved, I would have been better off calling up Fleet Farm or similar store to order. At least I wouldn't have to wait a month and a half for a simple 6' ladder. I will still shop amazon.com, but will skip it if it is sold by amazon. If you are an electrician, as I am, this ladder is for you. Save yourself 2 months and buy elsewhere."
3,"Enjoy that 15 minutes, Timmy?","Nice to see that the once-hot Tim Sykes enjoyed his little brush with fame, but as the respected ""Trader"" magazine publishes the 2007 list of ""Hottest Traders Under 30,"" our sad little Timmy is nowhee to be found. Quoting from the magazine's lead paragraph:""You won't see Cilantro's humility-challenged Tim Sykes, who in the past year has gone from wunderkind to Ryan Leaf-like laughingstock.""[...](Ryan Leaf, for those non-football fans, was the second pick in the 1998 NFL draft -- behind Peyton Manning -- who was such a bust he was out of the league only a few years later.)"
4,This show is for MATURE CAPITALISTS ONLY,"For those who would tune into WALL STREET WARRIORS; believing that this series is some satirical view on capitalism, this may not be for you. WSW is a surface look at the wheels that keep Capitalism rolling along. I find the show to be a breath of fresh air, when it comes to showing how the pursuit of profit, can drive some people in their business activities. I rate this show up there, with APPRENTICE, Season 1. I will definitely be adding this series to my DVD collection. For all TRUE CAPITALIST out there reading this......WELCOME HOME!!"
4,Wall Street Warriors,I thought the dvd was entertaining but I didn't live up to my expectations as far as the daily going ons on wall street goes. It was a little superficial.
2,Poor show but good to show lifestyle of those that live in Wall Street,"Jumps through the live of like 8 different rich Investment Bankers in Wall Street in less than 24 min. Shows that they are rich but busy (not very enlightening). Perhaps the show sucked because it was the first episode and they needed to develop the characters. Even though it sucked, I will still watch the second episode as I'm curious because I am in the industry and hope it will become a better show."
2,Made Wall Street seem boring as hell....,"I saw this season's programs on MOJO. Man, I can't believe how boring the entire series was. The producers obviously couldn't get any real professional Wall Street traders to be featured on the show, so they took what they could. I still remember how embarassed I was for folks like Tim Sykes sitting in his little apartment wearing a ragged, threadbare housecoat and complaining how his mother didn't have time to do his laundry that week. And another classic was watching a market maker at AMEX stare over the shoulders of a floor trader punching buttons into a machine while ominous music played in the background, as if that was something exciting. This is your job? And the AMEX....jeez, what an irrelevant place to work. Please don't waste your money on this."
1,BORING!,Another reality TV show with no content & pure hype.I would not recommend this product to others. Not even the institute for mentally retarded.
4,reverb doesn't kill,"EXTRACTIONS is the great release by the mysterious instrumental 4AD band DIF JUZ. They have a unique sound of trippy, melodic, and ambient electric guitars juxtaposed against a syncopated and driving rhythm section (the track ""Echo Wreck"" expemlifies this, and is worth the price of the CD). What sets these guys apart from other instrumental bands (especially on this release) , is their talent for melody and songwriting. The songs never sound like the band is just meandering or (worse) 'jamming'. The only thing about this album that stops it from being called a timeless record is the 'big reverb' production aesthetic that was so characteristic of 4AD releases. But hey, too much reverb never killed anyone's buzz."
3,Good Story...Great Effort!,"This is a commendable effort for a first-time novelist.On the surface, it is a tender story of young love. However, it is the story of the Cavender and Goodwin families that really matters. The novel reminds one of the crucial role played by family relationships in one's life.Although the story is set in the 1870's in Eastbourne in Sussex, England, the author's sense of place and time is quite remarkable. Furthermore, the characters are believable and fully-realized that one can truly care for some and utterly dislike others.Typographical and editing errors were sometimes distracting but the story itself went along at a good pace and certain plot developments provided some surprising and moving moments."
4,Heartwarming,For a first time Novel I am really impressed.When I started reading this book I became mesmerized by the characters I couldnt put it down.It has a steady pace that kept my interest until the end.The story of Adeline and Giles melt my heart.I enjoyed the twist and turns along the way.I recommend this book to everyone.
5,Watch out for flying fish!,"Years ago I visited the Fish Market. I liked the idea of the show they put on by throwing the fish. As I got real closed to take a picture....I almost became part of the show. Luckily my martial arts training, http://www.kaizenmartialarts.com, paid off and I was able to avoid being tackled by a King Salmon.The care that the owners of this business have for their employees is fantastic. What is even better is that they have found a way to give back. Who would have thought that a small fish market could have such a global impact for good!!"
3,Okay,"This wasn't what I was originally looking for. I wanted a video of the Pike Place Fish Market. This book did prove to be interesting though. It isn't a must read, but was fairly informative."
4,DVD: The VillIan,"The DVD arrived in a timely fashion and was in perfect condition. No complaints would be justified in the way the sale or delivery was handled.The movie was a very camp takeoff on a Wiley Coyote cartoon, and was exactly what I recalled. That's why I ordered the movie -- it's fun!!"
3,A laugh a minute,This is a not-so-classic western but still funny. I haven't seen it in years but I wanted it so it's mine...all mine.For anyone who hasn't seen it:Cactus Jack Slade is an outlaw with a pair of 6 guns at his side and a black horse (Whiskey) who's the obvious brains of the operation. In his pursuit of a strongbox full of money he is the human version of Wiley Coyote with Arnold Schwarzeneger and Ann Margret in the part of the Roadrunner.
5,wonderful!,"arnold schwarzenegger like you've never seen him! he doesnt cuss, or shoot anyone, and only drinks milk! a truly wonderful movie in the style of great american spoofs!"
5,The Villian,"This movie is pure escapist cowboy fantasy. Douglas, as Cactus Jack, is the most villainous bad guy ever, sadly his horse is smarter than he is. If you imagine him as Wylie Coyote, you understand his character- and the bad luck that befalls him as he pursues the girl and the gold. If you can't deal with a cartoon level of silliness, as we saw in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, you will probably find this painfully silly. If you liked Roger, you'll love this. Handsome Stranger, played by Schwarzenegger, is wonderfully strong, and honorable. Ann-Margret, as Charming Jones, plays her usual frankly sexy role, which sets Handsome's virtue off beautifully. The rest of the movie is decorated with a scattering of other stars having great fun playing their cowboy film over-the-top archetypes. This is one of my favorite comedies- always brings a smile to my face, although I'll admit that there are days when it's even too silly for me."
4,GOOD CAST OF CHARACTERS,"KIRK DOUGLAS LIKE YOU NEVER EXPECTED! ALWAYS THOUGHT OF KIRK DOUGLAS AS A SERIOUS ACTOR. THE MOVIE IS STUPID, BUT ENJOYABLE! GOOD MUSIC FROM MEL TILLIS HELPS A LOT!"
3,: (,"I bought this movie, because a family member had seen it years ago and liked it.I watched it once and it was very funny there were several sexual referances in the movie coming from Ann-Margret but you can tell that by the cover.Funny as is was, at times you felt like you were watching the same things over and over again.I wouldn't watch it with young children."
5,A must see for Arnold lovers!!!,"This is the consumate ""Coyote vs Road Runner"" movie. It is non stop hillarity at it's best. The combination of Arnold and Kurt is incredible. I recommend this movie to everyone, it's a great family film."
3,good laugh,"oldie but a goodie, got it for my mother in law who hasn't seen it for years, she loved it as well"
3,"Alas, pan -n- scan","I first saw the movie years ago and thought it was hysterical. Sadly this release crops the movie -- if it were widescreen I would buy it in a heartbeat.5 stars for the movie, -2 for poor DVD."
1,The Villain,"I love the movie, but since its only in pan & scan on the DVD I will not buy it. When (if) it comes out in widescreen it will be an immediate purchase. The studio needs to release this in widescreen for those of us who prefer to see the whole movie as it was made and intended."
4,Enjoyable and Fun,"This movie is highly entertaining and just plain fun. It isn't intended to be an epic, like Spartacus or Cleopatra. It's simply fun.In many ways, this movie is reminiscent of Coyote and Road Runner, but with Kirk Douglas and Arnie Swartzenegger in the lead character roles. It is very camp, and if you enjoy comic camp, this is a really entertaining film. It does not allow itself to fret over such trivialities as political correctness. It just sets out to be loony fun. And for the purpose it seeks to achieve, it does so wonderfully.If you want good, hearty laughter, you could do far worse than this modest little film. Good clean fun and sappy slapstick all the way. Certainly you will agree, if you see this movie, that the outlaw's horse is much smarter than his master.The purpose of film is to entertain, and this little sleeper can deliver. This is not a movie for everybody, but those who appreciate camp should enjoy it."
5,an all time favorite,"This is one of my most favorite movies. It actually is a family favorite. We made our original ""beta"" copy when it 1st appeared on cable in the early ""70's-. Arnold, Mel Tillis- Ann Margaret, Ruth Buzzy-- Kirk Douglas - (he was amazing) Paul Lynn- Who am I missing-- Oh yeah the horse Whiskey - and road runner- This was hilarious in the 70's and still is. - As we showed it to all of our friends in the 70's-- we present it to all of our friends now- every one must see ""The Villain"" over and over and over.- cant get enough of it."
2,Paul Lynde. Ruth Buzzi. Mel Tillis. How Did They Go Wrong?,"""The Villain"" has a promising premise, a comic-western filmed in the style of a Warner Brothers cartoon, that fails in it's execution. The talented cast is certainly game. The blame lies almost entirely in the flat-footed direction of Hal Needham(""Smokey and the Bandit""). Virtually every gag thuds like a boulder dropped by the Coyote from a cliff. The humor here is not so much inspired but desperate. Recommended for less discriminating adolescents and others be forewarned. They couldn't even make good use of a screen treasure like Strother Martin."
5,the villian,the villian a great comedy western amust movie to have in ones collection kirk douglas is really hilarious perfect movie
5,Love this movie,"This is my all time favorite western spoof, zany, completely enjoyable movie. I do realize that puns are a low form of humor, but when done correctly can be extremely funny - and this is full of them. Whiskey, the horse, comes close to stealing certain scenes, which is great and the parallels with the Road Runner and Coyote are so good that you expect to see ""Acme"" on some things. Truly well done!"
4,"Villainous , but Funny for the whole family","First of all you take a bumbling hero, add an even more bumbling villain, stir in Ann-Margaret. Eliminate all expectations of a coherent plot and you can sit back and laugh. The Pan And Scan did this movie no favors, but Whiskey makes the movie.The Horse at times had the best lines in the movie, even saying that Hal Needham movies are not to be taken seriously anyway.The supporting cast headed by Paul Lynde, and Jack Elam is more than solid. If you liked Uncle Arthur on Bewitched, you'll appreciate Nevous Elk.My four kids range from 19 - 5 and most of the jokes were caught by the intended audience. The mild inuendo my 18 and 19 year olds caught. The broad slapstick the 7 & 5 year old caught. To keep them silent through a movie is surprising.The scenery is beautiful. So is the landscape.Enjoy adults not acting, but having fun...Tim Sanko"
3,Screwball Comedy,Slapstick comedy that keeps you laughing from beginning to end. Definitely a movie that could be watched over and over again for a marathon of laughs.
3,The horse is the best actor,"I don't mean to denegrate Kirk Douglas as an actor, and I'm sure everyone had fun making this picture. It's just that somehow it doesn't come off as funny as I thought it would. Live action based on a cartoon (Wile E. Coyote) is an interesting concept, but it falls a bit short of expectation. The Governator (Schwarzenegger) is as wooden as I've ever seen him, but this was an early movie of his, so he's improved with practice.The horse is hysterical! She (yes, it's a mare, although it's referred to as ""he"" throughout the movie) is one very smart animal. I currently have 6 horses of my own, and have worked with 35 others over time, so I have a pretty good idea of the intelligence level of the species. She is amazing, and is definitely worth the price of the movie.Paul Lynde and Ruth Buzzi, very funny people in their own right, are downright wasted in this movie. Neither had a chance to display the comedic talents they are gifted with, so that too was a disappointment."
2,"'Charming, just charming'","The Villain is definately a curiosity piece. After sitting through the whole 90 minutes (believe me, that's one hell of an accomplishment with this film) I've come away wondering who is this film aimed at? Part Road Runner film, part cowboy film and slapstick comedy, most of the humour is too silly for adults.I think all the other talented actors in this piece of tripe are pretty much waisted. I give the film 2 stars - one star for a very funny performance by Ann-Margret - her comedic talents are laugh out loud genuinly funny, the second star goes to the horse."
1,Amazon is great-but this movie was not!,The video was received promptly and was in very good shape.I guess my disappointment was that this movie was just not as funnyas I used to think it was!! Must be my age!But I have absolutely no complaint against Amazon--I LOVE doing business with you!
1,Rather sad,"This movie was recommended by a friend and so I was expecting it to be good. First it is not my sense of humor but mostly I just felt sad for Kirk Douglas having played the role in the first place. Paul Lynde stood out and the rest did an okay job for what they had to work with. The horse however was great and well trained. Frankly, I couldn't wait for it to end and Schwarzenegger as the ""handsome stranger."" Give me a break!"
1,A great cast in a lousy movie,"What a waste of these great actors and actresses. You'll laugh, all right, but from embarrassment, not humor. If you're looking for a great spoof of Westerns, look no further than Mel Brooks' classic, ""Blazing Saddles"", which is the movie this one was trying to be, but failed."
3,Ok DVD,"The item came on time, but the show was not that great to watch. Some of it was funny, but alot of it was repetitious plots. I'd pass on it unless your big fans of Malcolm and Eddie"
1,Cheap. Plastic.,"Not at all what I expected. Very cheap looking...similar to something you would find in a dollar store automotive aisle. ""Wavy"" chrome paint. Sorry, but...yuk."
5,"A short-lived slice of railway history, 1884-1889","This is an interesting little pamphlet of 32 pages plus card covers, on the Alford & Sutton Tramway, which ran between those two towns in Lincolnshire, in the years 1884-1889. It was built because the railway had come to Alford, and went out of use because the railway came to Sutton. It served a number of villages in between, but not enough traffic let to its early demise. The author, on holiday in Sutton between the Wars noticed that the signal box at Sutton carried the name `Tramway Crossing', and on enquiring as to why, discovered the former existence of the tramway, which had crossed the main-line, on the level, at that point. The booklet is illustrated with photographs and some line drawings, along with a map of the route.This is an enlarged and revised second edition of this booklet, originally published in 1947 by the Oakwood Press."
1,Don't buy it if you hate live music!!!,"I wish I had been warned that tracks 8,9 and 10 were recorded live in concert. Ugh, I hate that! So consider yourselves warned!"
4,Wonderful Highland Story,"This is the story of a girl who grows up and tries to keep her heart from ruling her life. She doesn't want to love David due to the long standing feud between their clans. The story starts with David and his Mother being captured by Breyandra's clan, and mistreated much to her father's dismay. Then the story continues through the trials and tribulations of the times and what is correct and what is assumed. There is talk of witches, ""daft people"", black rogues, and love as well as conniving mistresses... nice story!"
4,Great Reference Tool,"For the armchair history buff, as well as students from high school through college, this anthology of documents includes major and minor thoughts that have in one way or another contributed to the evolution of the United States. Arranged in 15 broad areas, these selections begin with the ""Just and Equal Laws"" section of the Mayflower Compact (1620), and end with ""I have done it the hard way,"" by Senator Bob Dole (1996). A chronology and full author/subject index make the work a useful home reference tool, and one that is likely to be found in many, many libraries."
1,Arrived damaged,"I'm not sure if I should blame Samsonite or the shipper, but the case arrived in bad condition. The handle had a series of scrapes on one side that cut through the leather. The top was also not aligned properly with the bottom. This meant that when you closed the case, you had to slightly pull the top to one side in order to correctly line up the latches. I returned this product and purchased a different case. I was very disappointed as Samsonite usually has great cases."
1,Stay Away - Owned for less then a year,"I bought one Feb 2011 and have to send it in for warranty service less then a year later. To be fair, the unit looks great when you first get it. Once I started to use it the problems came up.1) From day one the unit opened on any combination code. It just opens easier on the code you set. Why have a combination. I should have sent it back for this reason alone when I first got it but I already disposed of my old one and decided to live with the lax security.2) The leather around the handle has completely worn away.3) As of the writing of this review, one of the latches snapped in half.I'll be sure to update this review after I experience the warranty procedure."
3,Not as Expandable as expected,"This briefcase looks very nice and is well made, but I'm disapointed that it does not expand as much as they make it look in the picture. The picture makes it look like it doubles in size .... in reality it only increases in size by about a half inch."
1,Poor Quality,"I purchased this briefcase mainly due to the Samsonite brand name expecting the quality that this brand stood for in the past. Unfortunately, I was very unimpressed with this briefcase. It has no metal piano-type hinge to hold the top and bottom portions together, having just a leather flap which was totally insufficient. Some of the interior covering also came completely off of the wood structure. My previous briefcase lasted over 15 years and this one did not last 15 days."
4,Realistic Characters; Great Read,"Sit down and settle in for a great read. You'll want to become Paisley Sterling's best friend. E. Joan Sims spins a real story filled with loveable, memorable characters. I can't wait to see what Paisley, her mother Anna, and her daughter Cassie dream up for their next mystery adventure!"
3,Good period western,"The original version is not as gritty or realistic as the recent remake, but it is none the less an excellent western for its day. Dated a bit in the special effects area, it still holds up well in acting, directing and cinematography. I recommend viewing the two as a double feature. The original first and then the recent remake, which is outstanding."
3,The Original,"It was interesting to see this original 50's version after having seen the newer version with Russell Crowe and Christian Bale. I didn't feel much connection in the relationship between these two characters. Perhaps that was more in keeping with male character back in the 50's but it feels to me like flat acting. This original focuses on our hero being motivated by what his wife thinks about him, a switch from the way the newer version has tweaked the script. Worth a view for comparison purposes."
5,The original and still the best.,"This is a cracking good western with Glenn Ford playing the bad guy and doing a great job of it. He is a nasty villain but with lots of charm. Van Heflin is the conflicted rancher trying to deliver Ford to the 3:10 train to Yuma without getting killed by Fords gang. Top notch filming, acting and writing."
4,Better than the remake,I saw this when it came out years ago. When I saw the remake with Rusell Crow I decided to rewatch the original. I had forgotten how good Glenn Ford was in the role. Better than the remake.
4,3:10 to Yuma (Special Edition),I wanted to see this version before the recent re-make and was not disappointed. The performances are good and the deeper emotional and ethical issues make for contemplative entertainment. The remake will have to be very good to meet the standard of this earlier version.
3,3:10 to YUMA ( 1957 VERSION ),"If you plan to watch the 2007 version of this movie, you need to watch this version first. The 2007 version does not make since unless you see this veresion first."
2,Why do people think this one is better???,"After seeing the recent remake first, I find the original is a pale version of what the concept could have been, as realized in the more current version. Here,we get the usual maudlin '50s Hollywood treatment, where good triumphs over bad amid syrupy strings and men of indeterminate age who kind of all look the same: clean-shaven wearing the costume department version of ""Western"" wear. This looks like a TV Western to me. Useful, if only for comparsion purposes."
2,"Unfortunately, not very realistic","Again, I am forced to serve as the lone reviewer who believes this film to be over-rated. I am definitely a Glenn Ford fan, but the idea that Ford simply waits for the train to come and take him away, while he and Van Heflin sidle down the street definitely didn't move me. I'm sorry but the rest of the film didn't ring true either. Richard Jaeckel gets killed in a weird, unrealistic way, and Henry Jones gets lynched somehow. The scenes with Heflin's wife are stagey and uncomfortably hard to believe.I would rate both Jubal and Cowboy much higher, more realistic, especially Cowboy. Check out Cowboy first and then Jubal. Either of these are better than 3:10. Sorry, Delmer Daves/Glenn Ford fans."
1,did not watch this movie,"This movie I had to return cus I didn't know that dvd's came in ""REGION"" form. Well I ordered region 2 and we in the USA use ""REGION 1"" so I have to reorder in Region 1 form."
5,MASTERPIECE,"***** 1957. Directed by Delmer Daves and adapted from an Elmore Leonard story. With Howard Hawks' RIO BRAVO and Fred Zinnemann's HIGH NOON, 3:10 TO YUMA is the perfect illustration of one of the main themes of the western genre: The Law against The Outlaws. Note the exceptional musical score and the praiseworthy performance of Glenn Ford playing an unusual character for him."
4,The Great Build-Up,"This 50's Western. which received great reviews on it's debut, is well worth the praise. The psychological build-up is gradual, with smaller peaks along the way (the man hanging by the stairs is a particularly memorable one) until the viewer is as tense as the characters. The characterization is excellent and it stars several well-known names, including Glenn Ford and Van Heflin. If you're a western movie buff, it's well worth a look."
3,Glenn Ford's 3:10 to Yuma,"My husband was interested in seeing the original version of ""3:10 to Yuma"" starring Glenn Ford before seeing the updated version starring Russell Crowe and Christian Bale. If you are a fan of old westerns and enjoy movies such as ""High Noon"", you will enjoy this movie too. Even though its dated and some people might find it a tad corny by today's somewhat questionable standards, it does have a message of personal integrity and morality (even from the bad guy, though a bit tweeked!). There really is some value in watching old movies and discovering a worthwhile production could be created without a trillion special effects,foul language, and explicit sex. Imagination is a wonderful tool!!"
3,Really we are such?,"Oh... I even don't know, from what I should start... Perhaps that I am Russian, and it's the most stupid film about Russia I ever seen (OMG!!! Really we are such?). About story I'll keep silent - it's fairy tale & nothing.Music: Sun zara!!! The rest - not so good.About actors: Salman - only presented on the screen (did not try),Sneha - tried, but here... newcomer is newcomer (yet),MITHUN - ABSOLUTLY AWESOME!!! (Mimoh, lucky is you! :))) Only at him it's possible to look in this film! It's sheer pleasure!!! I have bought this film only because of DADA. And because of absolutely unforgettable month of shootings!"
3,Representative of L.A. Club Rap Style,"Delicious Vinyl's newest album, ""Prime Cuts"", is a very eloquently remixed version of a well-known style often seen in underground freestyle clubs, mainly in L.A. and surrounding areas. Many names, who use similar styles popped into my head, most of whom remained in the underground market, when I heard this album. It originally came in as a ""promo"" to a record store I manage. Delicious Vinyl does mix in a very unique style of R&B to its rapping style that also touched on soul. Although not a completely original and ""new beat"", these artists definitely have a wonderful and well known talent for mixing better known beats of many different genres, arriving at a piece that can be appreciated from many different musical perspectives."
3,"Stand is just ""okay""","I initially loved the stand, but walked into living room and found my guitar on the floor. Thank God I have carpet or my guitar possibly could have been damaged. To date it hasn't fallen again, but its not the sturdiest stand and I'm always worried about it falling."
5,On stage stand,"Exactly what it says, works perfectly for my guitar, my roommate has one similar to it and it holds his giant electric bass."
5,Great stand for the price,"Great stand for the price. I have it holding a parlor-sized guitar, but it would hold a standard dreadnought just as securely. Neck holder can extend to hold taller guitars and the security strap works well, keeping the guitar from falling out when moving it around. Definitely happy I bought it and will purchase another one as soon as I buy another guitar."
4,Good Cheap Stand,"Bought this along with a new 12-string acoustic. I got it for $9.95, and I am very pleased with it. Assembly was super easy, and it does a good job supporting the neck."
4,pleased.,I read the reviews of people who were dissatisfied with this guitar stand. I don't get their beefs. the bottom bracket swivels in order to accommodate any size/shape guitar. It is only a hassle if you aren't the type that is gentle with your guitar. They should charge at least twice the price for this stand. I bought four of these.
2,don't like the wobbly effect...,"it's semi-secure on carpeting or hard floor, but all together I am pretty unsatisfied with this stand. The bottom piece has no way to lock in place, and although with the guitar on it it is more stable, I am not comfortable enough risking my wonderful guitar to something rather flimsy...I prefer the one that is mounted on the wall as more stable overall. This one? Meh. Not worth the purchase in my opinion... booooooooo."
5,I love it,Well made and sturdy. Very stable and protective of my guitar. one two three four five six seven eight nine
4,Great guitar stand and price,"Holds my Fender Strat very well, I plan on buying a few more. It's pretty strudy and great for home use."
5,Excellent stand and ON-TIME Shipping,"I was so stoked to hear the doorbell ring this morning before work! I selected the 3-5 business day shipping and it was here on the 3rd day of shipping! I love the stand it's heavy duty, looks great, and is really simple to put together! I love my new guitar stand and the fact it showed up on the earliest arrival date! I would recommend this stand for anyone looking for a luxury way of storing your guitar or another stand to add to the collection! Thanks to the guys n gals at MUSIC123 for a good online shopping experience! I will definitely be back for more stuff! O ya on the return label they even included a 10% discount coupon for my next purchase!"
5,Guitar Stand,Fast on delivery it was what I was looking for ...I have tried it out really new to playing the guitar so just wanted to make sure I take care of what needs to be..good product
5,Perfect and Fast,Came fast and great product! Takes two seconds to put together and very sturdy. Took all of three days to get here!
4,Gets the job done,"I have two of these. It's a pretty nice stand that holds your guitars securely.The only complaint I have is that sometimes the guitar strap on my acoustic gets caught in the bottom foam-lined holder and rotates it around when I quickly remove the guitar from the stand. This can be fixed by not removing it so quickly or arranging the strap such that it doesn't catch on the bottom holder when you remove the guitar.If the strap does get caught on the holder, it's likely to pull the whole thing out if it becomes fully rotated upside-down. This can be fixed by putting zip ties on the back of the holder where it meets the vertical tube so that it can't remove itself so easily."
5,Guitar Stand,This item is a good way to keep your instrument in a neat and secure way. It is easy to set up and holds guitar securely in place. It is also very attractive.
5,Great stand for home use.,"This stand is just perfect for it's price and what it is to be used for. The other people reviewing this said they didn't like that the piece that craddles the guitar swivels, it is supposed to. The music store this came from even sent a cute key chain in the shape of a guitar. Shipped promptly and well packed. I recommend these guys if you need a stand for your guitar!"
3,It's ok as long as you dont have a XIPHOS,"Pro tip, do not buy if you own XPT700 Xiphos series Ibanez. Works for my other guitars but does not work for the XPT (well doesn't work well!). Otherwise it's a decent stand. Fits my seven string Ibanez okay. The Xiphos has 'legs' that tilt the stand back. After putting my Xiphos on it though, I would have hated to try and use this with a Gibson Explorer, the stand would probably snap."
2,NOT very stable,"If you accidentally put your guitar on a bad position , it can come down with the whole stand and damage your guitar, I recommend a more stable stand for a few dollars more."
3,Does the job,"It's not exactly the sturdiest guitar stand out there, but it's well padded and certainly does the job for a great price."
5,Great Product,"There are things about this stand that make it affordable, and it is those things that also add to it's value.The cradle just sits in the main tube and swivels easily - but this ensures that however you place the guitar on it, it will settle into it.The top tube insets into the bottom tube and the nut at back holds it in place - this allows you to adjust the height on the top cradle.The legs are pop-riveted in - that means it folds up easily. NOTE: You have to make sure the legs are snapped into place when open or the stand will not be stable.I like the security rubber band, it keeps the guitar from popping out while your carrying it around.The padding on the bars fits well, no slippage.The feet are rubber, no slip and long lasting. Great bargain here, I really like this stand."
1,"Bad Product - never again, On Stage","Product was defective when received. There is an adjustment screw for the stand height that fits into a nut that is welded on the bottom half of stand. The nut was too big, (or adjustment screw too small), rendering the stand useless. Giving ""On Stage Stands"" the benefit of the doubt, I called them up to be promptly hung up on and busy signals on repeat attempts. (Hung up on before even explaining the problem. Seemed like one person, one phone line operation and as soon as I gave the model number the phone went dead) Don't make the mistake of ordering this ""companies"" products, fool me once..... Amazon great as always with returns."
4,fragile,"I bought 2 of these (for a higher price). They work fine, but are fragile. The upper cradle is only spot welded in two spots [soft welds] and if you put any sort of weight on it at all those two welds will break. My son was using one for his short scale bass guitar until it broke.For the money it is a good value if you are careful. My neighbor has a welding setup, and if I can get the rubber off will have him fix it for me.ETA: I bought two more of these at a fantastic price here on Amazon. The ones I got this time were a little different and had a different label on them. Basically the same thing and I am happy with them. They look to be made a little bit better. Still a little fragile looking, but the weld is larger and in comparing to the original ones I have, they look to be a little sturdier."
3,good for the cost,only thing i would like to see change is the bottom rest to be in just one position (so it doesnt twist. it does not infulence the way the guitar rests because the wait flattens it but my other ones dont have moving bottoms.
5,Perfect for the Price,"Works great, holds the guitar perfectly and secure every time. Does what its supposed to do and very decently made, especially for such a low price. Shipped quick and excellent packaging."
5,JUST EXCELLENT,"You dont know the quality of the product you paid for until you have it in your hands.This guitar stand is just great. Great quality, easy to assemble, really neat... my guitar looks great on it."
4,"product is a little wobbly, but still a good stand","this product is a bit wobbly, but for the price, it can't be beat. there is a safety strap for the neck of the guitar. and it is light and easy to move. would buy again."
5,Easy to put together,Easy to put together and a stable stand to hold a electric guitar when not in use. The materials used a sturdier than I would have thought for less than $10.
1,broke after a month,The base holding the guitar broke after 1 month. The base is the metal fork shaped holding the guitar. It was great when it was working.
4,Simple and Functional,"This guitar stand is pretty cheap but it does the job. I just got it in the mail a few days ago and noticed one problem. After unfolding the legs and folding them back together, the black paint comes off because it rubs on the little pieces of metal that support the legs when place them in the open position, but its not like its made for opening and closing. Its made to stand and hold the guitar. AND the bottom piece that holds the guitar just turns upside down slides into a ridge and turns upward, but doesn't really lock in place with any type of screw. Guitar wont fall because it has a ridge that the bar needs to slide out of, i just thought it would have some type of a screw to hold it in place. Other than that this is a good piece for the money, and i would recommend this to anyone that doesn't want to spend a lot on a guitar stand. Simple and Functional."
4,great product especially for the price,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift and the recipient really enjoys it. There were no instructions but setup was intuitive and didn't take long at all. If you need to go somewhere, the stand can also be dissembled, making it much more portable for carrying in a backpack or tote bag."
4,It's SUPPOSED to swivel,I bought two of these for my basses (P-bass and Stingray) and they work just fine. They assemble in about 30 seconds. Anyone complaining about the body rest swiveling has obviously never seen or used a guitar stand before. They're supposed to swivel to conform to different body styles. Good buy.
5,Better than leaning it against the bed,"Decent stand, just sits there like it should, the bottom swings side to side as you drop the guitar into place, then you set the neck into the holder and stretch the retainer into place. Now its nice and safe, couldn't be better unless you decided you needed to nail it to the floor. It is nice looking and works."
5,Quality guitar stand.,"Quick shipping, good packaging, quality item. Great price relative to what I was finding in stores and on-line. Glad to have the guitar off the floor! :)"
3,Get what you pay for.,"Now I""m not saying this product is bad but it isn't the best. I do agree it really go's above and beyond for what you pay for it though. Decent craftsmanship and you get your moneys worth, nough said."
4,Working out great:),"So far so good with this guitar stand. I actually purchased two, and both of them are working great for my classical, steel string and 3/4 guitars. My cats have had kitty battles around them and nothing has budged one iota:) As my guitar collection grows, I am considering if I may need another:)"
5,Great for home use!,"First guitar stand ever owned. Kind of a spontaneous buy, couldn't be happier. Gets the job done and doesn't take up any extra room in the house."
1,Poorly constructed .... misaligned and basically defective.,"I wanted an inexpensive, basic stand for my guitar , so I picked this one. When I assembled it, I could tell right away it was misaligned at the factory and basically defective. I managed to bend it into shape a little , but it's still a bit wonky. You might want to avoid this particular stand, there are plenty more available to choose from in this price range."
3,"Cheap, but works!","I got what I paid for! I don't like that the bottom part can swing back and forth, but it holds the guitar just fine, and the strap is great considering my infant thinks the guitar is fun, and she should have it! It withstands her, so I'm satisified!"
4,"Does the job, but could be better","I can't really complain for the price, but I'll note things that could be improved:No instructions included in the box - the stand is simple enough to assemble, but I had to refer to the picture on Amazon to make sure I put all the pieces together right.The bottom holder isn't secure - it wobbles and will fall out when the guitar is not on the stand.But as a stand, it does the job, holds the guitar upright, and seems to be gentle enough that it hasn't scratched my instrument. Worth it for the price."
2,missing part,"the nut that holds the base which holds up the guitar was missing. what this means is that it will hold my guitar, but the base swings around freely if the guitar is not in it. it is functional, but certainly not perfect."
5,totally cool guitar stand,I like my guitar stand. It looks much better than the cardboard box I was using and folds up nice and neat. It comes with a bag I've yet to use and what I think is a super feature is a little rubber gate thingy that keeps the guitar from coming off the stand. A steal at the price. I got the music stand too made by the same company. Bargain prices for nice quality. I'm happy.
5,Great stand for the price and fast shipping,Great stand--it's sturdy and easy to set up.Zzounds shipped this item very quickly--I received it the day after it was ordered (standard shipping).
1,Junk!,"One star is too much - this piece of junk deserves zero! This damn thing damaged my guitar with that wobbly base being unsecured. I read other such reviews, and as such I was careful every time I put my guitar back in place. However, as luck would have it, the base was off center this time, and the neck fell sideways against some furniture and the guitar tumbled to the floor. I could care less about a refund, what really disturbs is that I damaged an expensive guitar that also has sentimental value as a gift from my wife and kids some years ago. This is an extremely poorly designed product, and I am furious with myself for having bought it, and then subsequently continuing to use it! What I want now is my guitar repaired!!!"
1,Unbalanced,"All I can say about this item is that it is utterly terrible. When you put a guitar on the stand, it leans back to the point where it falls backwards. Totally unstable and could ruin a guitar easily. It is baffling how this stand could be made so poorly. It's not that hard to make a stand that does its job. Look elsewhere for a stand."
3,"Nice stand, eventually","Not crazy about having to pay shipping that amounted to half the purchase price for the stand, not to mention having to wait five days for it to arrive. No assembly instructions were included in the packaging. I've never owned something like this before, so that was annoying. Luckily, some nice pictures were posted on the web page and I was able to figure it out from there. Once I got it put together, and placed my beloved guitar in the thing, I got happier. It looks nice and holds the guitar safely (padding protects the guitar finish). I'd recommend this stand to others, but be aware of shipping, tax and consider the possibility it will arrive with no assembly instructions. Not that you have to be a rocket scientist to put it together, still..."
3,"OK, it's a guitar stand and it works just fine","Nothing to rave about here, but it is sturdy and holds the guitar like it was designed to do looks ok too !!!"
1,Item not complete - missing a part,"This item is missing a part. The ""U"" shaped device at the bottom of the stand that the quitar sits on won't stay in place. It rotates around. How can I get a replacement or get the missing part?"
4,ok,works good for heaver guitars will tip a little its good for short tearm use i may get another one
3,"Meh, It's a guitar stand","Serves it's purpose. The bottom cradle comes loose/out easily which I fixed by simply bunching up a rubber band to prevent it from sliding out. Problem solved. If you're super anal about your gear, spend more than 10 bucks, seriously. For me, this does what it is supposed to do, hold my guitar, so for that it was worth it."
1,Unstable,"The rear leg is ""too short"" wich makes the stand unstable and loose balance towards the back .Front legs measure 11 inches , rear leg measures 3.5 inches (way too short) should be at least 5-6 inches .FretRest by Proline , way better !!"
5,A great guitar stand!,"I purchased this guitar stand about 2 months ago for storing my banjo. It works great. Also, it was very easy to assemble. For an inexpensive guitar/banjo stand, it fits the bill nicely."
5,Great Guitar Stand,"I purchased this stand to replace another similar stand that had rusted. It was over 10 years old and had just rusted from the normal environment changes and years of exposure.This new stand is nice and very similar to my previous one. I like these stands because it makes the guitar more available for play. The old saying ""Out of sight out of mind"". With this I find that I play more guitar because I see it sitting out.The foam padding is of good thick construction to help protect the guitar. The added security strap is nice. Especially if you have children, or move the guitar stand when cleaning.I hope that I will get 10 years out of this stand like I did the last one. More would even be nice. I would recommend this stand to anyone that is looking for one. My purchase experience was very good with Amazon."
1,Item Sux,Received 2 of these items 3 days ago. One was defective when it got here. I just got home tonight to a broken guitar on the other. These items SUCK!! Stay away.
1,Flimsy with no clear instruction,"Do not buy this guitar stand! It is very flimsy and it comes with no clear instruction. My package was missing a part, so I had to send it back."
5,Very good for the price!,"If you just want a simple, portable guitar stand, this is for you! Does what is needs to do and you are able to assemble it in a minute"
5,Does its job,My husband needed another stand for his guitar collection so I got him this. It was a good price and works well.
4,I like the safety strap,"This stand is really good. I really like the safety strap. If you are looking for a cheap guitar stand, buy this product."
1,Awful experience.,"This product could not have been designed for an acoustic guitar. No matter how you adjust the neck holders height, the stand will end up being extremely unstable and tip over at the slightest bump. To add to your woes, the loosely help bottom cradle is too short to accomodate most acoustic guitar and the guitars weight ends up being applied to the rubber band near the neck of the guitar. This was designed by the worst kind of swine."
5,Works for bagpipes too!,"I'll dare to give it a five. Performs as advertised, inexpensive, and doesn't smell bad! Got one for my *deployed* guitar and one for my bagpipes. Now both are ""upright and outta sight."" Much better than laying my pipes down on the table in my room, plus they're ready for rapid response (because one just never knows when the next bagpiping emergency will arise). Granted, I've only had 'em for a coupla weeks, but they won't get moved much (God willin' and the Taliban don't rise). If they fall apart, I'll be sure to let you know. I don't expect that to happen though, they seem to be pretty well put together."
5,"inexpensive, but good guitar/bass stand","wow, only ten dollars, and I like it. adjustable height, security strap, just makes it nicer. For the price and functionality this stand is a five star product. (I've been playing bass and guitar since 1985)"
3,Not bad,not bad guitar stand it has one weak point that is its not too stable it can fall :)but overall nice product i recommend
1,Crap,"Got this for my Taylor 914ce Grand Auditorium. Noticed it is very misaligned and wobbly upon assembly. No way will I prop my Taylor up on it, but will chance my Yamaha APX500 on it, as long as it's suported by a wall. Overall not even worth $12, and you'd have to be crazy to try using THIS stand to suport and or showcase a Instrument that is also a Work of Art. Live and learn. Not recommended at all."
3,Looks Good but the but not that stable,I didn't realize this thing should be pressed against the wall leaving black mark on the wall and you need to be very careful to place your guitar on.
2,NOT good for heavier guitars - broke after 2 months,"I would absolutely NOT recommend this stand for anyone with a guitar weighing over 7lbs. I have a solid body electric that came falling to the floor after 2 months of use because the metal on the bottom cradle buckled and snapped. The metal at the joint looks to be of horrible quality. Will never buy one of these again.Conversely, I have another that has been holding an acoustic for a much longer time, and have had no issues whatsoever. Cheap construction doesn't matter as much when the guitar only weighs a few pounds.If you're in the market for a stand specifically to hold something like a Les Paul or other solid body electric with heavier woods, look elsewhere. I feel like an idiot for skimping on the stand and almost destroying my favorite guitar. I would suggest not repeating my mistake."
2,Drug Life is Boring,"C'mon guys. Drugs aren't fun or cool, nor are juvenile little books about the ""gritty"" culture. I'm happy to report I found this book somewhere and didnt pay a dime for it. And then I foisted it upon a friend so someone could share my misery."
4,excellent example of the group's deep harmony roots,"Apparently the previous reviewer purchased this disk without being familar with the Manhattan's earlier work. The oustanding cuts are ""I'm The One Love Forgot,"" ""Can I,"" ""I Call it Love,"" ""When We Were Made As One,"" ""Follow Your Heart,""""It's That Time of the Year,""""Alone On New Year's Eve."" Notable one's are ""Baby I Need You"" and ""Baby I'm Sorry."" These songs are worth the price of the disk alone, particularly if you are a fan of sixties five-man group harmony."
4,always a good read,Francis writes the kind of books that you just can't put down. This one is no exception!!
4,"Delicious, with a catch...","I love these things. Eating one of these bars is highly reminiscent of snarfing down a handful of those super-sweet wafer cookies in all their unhealthy, refined yumminess. The only problem? Despite the 14gr of protein, I find these bars utterly unsatisfying. As someone who needs to make sure every calorie counts bigtime, I can't afford to eat a protein bar that won't carry me over to the next mealtime. Unfortunately, I can (and have) devoured more than one of these at a time in a single sitting. I believe I purchased a single bar in the grocery store recently as a ""treat"", but I can never buy a whole box of these bars ever again. These taste great, no question (though I do detect the ""protein"" aftertaste), just don't get them if you shouldn't be cramming them down your throat two at a time. Unless, of course, you have more self control than I do."
5,Love it.,This is the best tasting protein bar out there. It tastes like a real wafer and not like protein. Will buy again
4,Peanut butter cream ONLY!,"I like it when I am in the gym craving for a fast meal replacement. And among everything I have tried, this is the best flavor....(already)...not very sweet and creamy enough to fake yourself it's not a protein bar (lol)..."
3,Power crunch Bars,Can't say I really love them. A little too sweet and too thick as a taste...But good calorie count.
5,"Great snack, like eating a treat!",These are some of the best tasting protein bars I've ever had. they're like eating a snack but they've also got a good amount of protein in there. Power Crunch bars are my new favorite; I highly recommend you try them; I've had all of the flavors and not one of them was bad. What's the best one to try? If you like Peanutbutter then try that first - but I will say I usually don't like Vanilla flavored anything but even the Vanilla is very tasty and good.
5,Yummy!,"Has a higher fat content then I like but power bars should be eaten more early in the day anyways, so the fat will convert to energy (unless you overeat)a very light and yummy power bar considering it tastes just like a chocolate covered wafer.a new favorite power bar"
4,I've tried them all. This one rocks!,I Zumba a few nights a week and hated drinking a protein drink before. Left me feeling icky with bouncing around. Ive tried several different protein bars but they tasted nasty. My instructor told me about these and gave me one to try before next class. Loved it and had a great work out too!
1,Very Gross Aftertaste,"Protein bars are usually not the best tasting products on the planet, but this cookies and creme flavor is just horrible! It sticks around in your mouth for an hour and just doesn't settle well. Won't be buying again.."
4,Ok product,Taste is good. But it has some after taste but it is not too bad. I want to see more protein in 1 bar. But it is difficult to find with this price.
4,great,i enjoyed them very much. I would order again at another time. I would like to try a different flavor
5,Great tasting,Great tasting bars. Probably the best I've had yet. You won't be dissapointed in them. Cheaper than in the stores.
3,Tastes Great But Is It Really Good For You?,A friend of mine gave me a couple triple chocolate bars to try out. They were very tastey and I was going to buy a box until I noticed they contain partially hydrogenated soybean oil which I stay away from.
1,Not too tasty,"The berry flavor was okay on first bite, but then the after taste hit. Couldn't eat but maybe half of bar. Not sure what I will do with the rest now."
5,Most tasty protein bar I have ever had,This is the most tasty protein bar I have ever had. I introduced to people at work and some of them just get hooked. It is not as chalky as other and tastes like real chocolate wafer.
5,Yes please!,I love this product. It is tasty! The bar doesn't have as much sugar as the others and it doesn't taste like some of those over loaded protein powdery bars. This taste just like a twix with out all the sugar. Yummy!
4,"A *true* protein bar, does NOT contain hydrogenated oils!","My wife and I love these Power Crunch bars! They have a great protein content and are low carb, which is great for our current exercise and diet routine. Contrary to what's listed above, it does *not* contain hydrogenated *anything.*However, we're a bit concerned with the Palm Oil and Palm Kernel oils, and were told by BNRG that this was the healthiest alternative for the chocolately coating on the outside and the inside filling that would remain solid at room temps.My suggestion to them would be to make an alternative variety that has NO chocolatey coating (much like Bisco's sugar wafers), thus limiting the amount of oils that they'd need to use in these otherwise stellar protein bars."
1,Caution: contains Hydrogenated oil,"The ingredients lists hydrogenated oil as one of the ingredients ""partially hydrogenated soybean oil"".If there is one thing which you have avoid eating, then it is Hydrogenated oil - it is one of the primary cause of Heart disease and Cancer - the #1 and #2 killers.It also contains sucralose which is an artificial sweetener (sucralose is relatively safe, but it is best avoided)So, please avoid these cookies !"
4,Great for that crunchy craving.,I loved the crunch in these protein supplements. They are the lowest in calories from what I have been able to find. Very tasty too. Much like a wafer cookie.
4,delicious,"best tasting protein bars out there. Not as much protein as clif builder or others, but much tastier. I would recommend"
5,doesn't taste like a protein bar,"Among the various protein bars I've tried, Power Crunch and Oh Yeah! are the best. For one thing, they don't taste like a protein bar, more like a regular candy bar. Peanut Butter Fudge is my favorite flavor. Triple Chocolate is also very good."
5,Greatest tasting protein bar ever!,"having tried multiple (dry, tasteless)bars this is THE BEST!(Although I haven't tried more that two of their flavors)."
5,Some of the best tasting protein bars I've had..,I love these bars. What more can I say? They contain less sugar than a lot of other bars and still taste pretty good.
5,Yumm,"I've been trying protein bars recently because I have been tired of drinking Muscle Milk on tough training days. I recently tried this bar and really loved it. I like it because of the different texture than a lot of bars. Most I have tried have been sort of gummy and chewy, but this has the nice cripness of the cookie wafer. The bar tastes really good and I will buy this one again"
2,AO Safety ELC-22 Shooter's Ear Muff,"Plastic headband broke in half after 2 years use(about 40 times).Product is not designed for long term use. I now use Wilson Combat(made by Peltor)ear protectors. Still thinking about electronic earprotectors, don't know about their life span."
5,Excellent,"The whole cd is great Montreal Calling and Dusting Down the Stars are the two best songs I think, You should give Mobile a listen."
5,My former professor Dr. Reinholtz...,"is an excellent professor and researcher, and his book on Kinematics reflects this as it is clear and usable. Of all the engineering books I had to buy in college, this was one of the easiest to understand - excellent diagrams. You will be happy with this book, although, I highly recommend taking Dr. Reinholtz's Kinematics class in addtion to reading this book."
4,Peaches is still the shiznit!,"Peaches has scored another amazing album, looking back and movingn forward, she melds the best bits of electroclash, Miami booty bass, punk rock, and 80s retro to create, yet once, a sound and sensibility that's uniquely her own. No one else sounds like Peaches, or has the ""balls"" to - from inspired, no-BS title track opener (Impeach my bush/Impeach...Bush!), Peaches just keeps the hits cummin, hittin' it hard with: Tent In Your Pants, Giv'er, You Love It, Slippery Dick, and many more, climaxing with the rather menacing Stick It to the Pimp. What makes Peaches so cool is her deceptively simple, accessible electro-rock-dance ditties that, upon closer inspection, reveal subversion and a willingness, unlike many contemporary artists, to truly challenge social/political/sexual mores, i.e. Two Guys For Every Girl. Whether she's joking or not, all jokes have a kernel of truth. Another winner, Peaches, you deserve to have a big phat hit on TRL!"
5,"So dirty, you'll need a shower after listening!","This album is one of the most enticing and addicitve albums I have ever heard. The beats are hot, and the lyrics are dirty beyond description. Peaches knows how to push boundaries, and even when she is seamingly doing what has already been done a thousand times, it always sounds fresh and inviting. Right from the irresistable 'Tent In Your Pants' to the hot 'Rock the Shocker', this album is a sleazy undergound ride you'll want to take over and over. It's worth grabbing if only for the greatest album title in history!!!!This album certainly has 'mass appeal'!!"
1,sophmoric and unoriginal,"Nothing new about dirty words set to minimal beats: see My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult, or even Miss Kitten, who do this with a lot more style.As for innovation, Kraftwerk pioneered electronic music of this sort many, many, many years ago.Fun, in it's own silly way, but that's about it."
1,Another Reason Why Moonbat Performers Shouldn't Go Political,Ummmm.....where do I begin?With the name?
5,Peaches KICK IT Harder than ever!,"This CD is just as good if not better from previous Peaches CDs; it's all killer with absolutely no filler. On Teaches and Father there was only like 4 or 5 good songs, all the tracks on this are spectacular. Beat wise Impeach My Bush is much better from the past albums that Peaches have made (its not one continuous beat for four minutes). Its BOOMIN! Lyrically she's still the trashy goddess of electroclash that everyone f*ck*ng loves!"
4,"Inventive, Surprising","I'll admit, I expected a biography of the Dave Matthews Band but was pleasantly surprised--this is a clever book with some wacky characters (and an even wackier sci-fi premise) with weird names and a bizarre (albeit short) cd (evidence) included. Great fun for old and young alike. And no mention of that ""band"" from Charlottesville."
2,"A guilty pleasure, though not at all original","The Living Dead meet Subspecies. I'll admit my main reasons for seeing this were Jason Statham, Pam Grier, and Joanna Cassidy whom I like very much. Yes, it was typical sci-fi horror fare. The zombie aliens reminded me of living dead vampires, and were things I'd seen before. Many times. But it was still fun to watch. Until the ending which was just plain stupid. *Spoiler* Why did Ice Cube's character live? Just so he could say a final cheesy line? Is there going to be a sequel? Oh dear. With my favorite 3 people dead, I can guarantee I won't go see the next one..."
2,Disappointing But Not Unwatchable,"This movie has everything going for it. It has a likable cast that's headed by the super hot Natasha Henstridge (of Species fame) and Ice Cube. It has great special effects. Above all of that, it's a John Carpenter flick, which usually means it's going to be something memorable. This is why I was extremely surprised at how disappointing it turned out to be. It's not a horrible movie but it wasn't as good as it should've been.I guess that this could be attributed to the fact that it was missing that something special. It didn't have that zesty aura that great movies of this genre generated. It was blah at best. If you like science fiction, you might like this movie but it probably won't drive you wild or anything. Rent it, don't buy it."
1,HORRIBLE,i rented this movie with my mom cause it sounded cool but we started watching it the movie had no plot or suspense and you couldnt listen 5 seconds before you heard the f-word.it was so stupid and not scary i didnt even watch half of this movie.so unless you wanna hear ice cubes limited vocabulary i dont recomend this movie to anyone
1,WTF?????????????????????,Glad I RENTED this steaming pile! How can a studio make money on this tripe????????????
2,I like most of John's movies,"but not this one. It is completely incoherant, with Natasha Henstrich and Ice Cube trying to out-bad each other. Overall, just not anyone's time."
1,Realmente lamentable,"Cuando uno escucha John Carpenter se imagina algo bien logrado, cuando uno ve los actores, los cuales ya cuentan con una experiencia y algunos trabajos aceptables no puede dejar de pensar que esta ante algo al menos ""interesante"".Sin embargo desde el comienzo nos encontramos ante algo lamentable, suspenso de risa, efectos especiales hechos con el paint de Windows 3.11, y actuaciones en algunos casos dignos de algún premio a ""desastre del año"". Créanme no estoy exagerando, si no la han visto por favor no GASTEN dos horas de vida en esto. Realmente no vale la pena, es preferible mirar los avisos en el cable antes que esto."
1,Carpenter should retire,"You know how films like Titanic win Best Picture? The studios send films like this to the voters, then let them follow that up with anything they want rewarded. Any Ernest film could win Best Picture after watching this film. Don't fool yourselves into thinking that anything Carpenter-esque is in this film. Did he really direct this? Were all the actors in this movie that hard-up for cash? I love THE THING, I even enjoyed VAMPIRES, which was an average film at best. This film is so bad, it's not even cult-bad. It's not even the type of bad where you'll watch it every time it's on TBS like 70's Burt Reynold films. Ed Wood couldn't make a film worse than this one."
1,Would someone please get John Carpenter a BRAIN???,"This is probably the dumbest, most idiotic attempt at a Sci-fi movie in the last 10 years. To start, the script is stupid: every major decision that could cause the characters trouble is usually made as a device to keep the plot (as little as there is!!!) going. How little? Well, just imagine a five minute plotline padded into 90 minutes. I regret this movie stole this time from my life!"
1,Music by John Carpenter,"That should have warned me right there, ""Music by John Carpenter."" The whole movie in about two sets, more like a play. Red dust blowing everywhere. I love ""Escape From New York,"" but I couldn't wait to escape from this dog. The music was bad."
3,I've Seen Worse,The flick's okay; its got momentum. The story line keeps moving; it has constant energy. BUT... the disc's bit rate is extremely low - it never gets above 3.0; and that means the video quality sucks. My advice is to wait for this flick to come out in HD.
3,"A Must SEE if you like ""BAD"" futuristic sci-fi movies",I enjoy Jason Statham and Ice Cube movies. Them together along with Natasha Henstridge(from Species) and Pam Grier(Jackie Brown) in this Road Warriors meets Dawn of the Dead bloody futuristic sci-fi action movie was absurdly interesting...A must see if you enjoy off-humor B/C movies like I do.
2,I have to be honest. This movie was horrible.,"When I watched this movie I was in the mood to watch a movie with good acting and good action sequences, I got bad acting and lame action sequences."
2,Not to good,"I really like John Carpenter and my favorite movie growing up was Escape From New York. I own every movie he directed and this one is at the bottom of my Carpenter favorites. It's not bad, but it's not good either."
2,Bad movie to watch just for fun,I agree with other reviewers - this movie is bad. It has it all from lame dialogue to massive plot holes. Reminds me of other bad movies like Doomsday that you just watch because they are bad.
4,DVD,My husband has been looking for this movie for a while. He was excited I had found it. One of his favorites.
3,another zombie undead movie-> on Maqs,"A variation on the curse of the mummy ( Martian style): from an buriedancient ruin a ""disease' emerges that turns people into head hunting , flesh eating zombies. The dust that carries the disease is on the wind turning relatively quiet Martian mining towns into butcher shops.The cops who venture into this zone of terror and horror fight for their lives and make a truce with the criminal who are relatively sane.Virtually no body makes it out alive... a lot of actionand blood with very little real plot.A designed sci fi horror movie that was made to sell tickets.The acting, setting and script are better than average for a just a ripthem up and kill them all picture.The antihero in action type of movie?"
2,havent we seen this before in John Carpenter,"I think this is somewhat of Carpenter's Assault On Precint 13...which was better then this snoozer....Henstridge and co(Grier, Statham and DuVall) find a place that is desolated and somethings happened..people are all crazed like zombies..Henstridge and co also has help from Mr. Desolation Williams(Ice Cube) who is good in this puppy who what gives....alot of the victims look like they turned into punk rockers I mean come on...we couldve did without them punkasses"
1,Been Done Better Before,"This movie, although filled with promise, fails to deliver an all fronts. Even the soundtrack which was written by John Carpenter and features metal luminaries Buckethead and Anthrax fails to inspire. Should the film and soundtrack have lived up to their potential, the movie would have been a genre founder. As it stands, it seems more like a training ground for recent FX and make-up film school graduates. Usually when films fail on the content, they make up for it with action, effects, or sex, and in this film, for all three, they're not good enough or non-existant."
4,cool and groovy,"Surreal sets, eerie soundtrack and Natasha gloriously blowing up monsters makes for one good time, indeed.John Carpenter's films satisfy at the level of true imagination that encompasses fear and humor.I wish ""hyper-critics"" could go down as easily as evil Martians."
2,Not good,"John Carpenter has given us some great films, Assault on Precinct 13, The Thing, Escape from New York to name a few. Directed with style and flair they were never going to be film classics, but they were very entertaining films. But it has been a long time since we had a half decent film out of him...I had read the reviews but I liked the idea of a Mars take on Assault on Precinct 13 so I was happy to give this a chance.Somewhere in this is a good idea and a good movie but in the delivery it fails and there really is very little on the positive side. The Carpenter magic still seems to be absent and he has delivered a third rate SCI-FI slash film that deserves the bad reviews it has been getting.Sorry John, I really did want to like it."
4,"Excellent ""C"" movie.","My wife and I found it boring when we saw it in the theatre. But it's better on the small screen, so that I have done a wargame based upon it."
1,Waste of time!,"This is one of those movies in where you sit and keep watching and watching and watching, hoping that its going to get better. Well, unfortunately, it's a big waste of time. I am a John Carpenter fan, so it pains me to say these things."
2,Mr. Carpenters worst yet!,"It really hurts me to write this review, since there is no way that i can say anything positive about this movie. I have been a fan of John Carpenter ever since Halloween, and didnt think i would ever watch a bad movie made by him, but here it is. The story is thin, the actors awful and the directorial job nonexistent. This is not a ""fun"" b-movie like Prince of darkness or Village of the damned, just a plain bad movie.I will give it two stars: One for the movie, and one for old friendships sake. Better luck next time Mr Carpenter!"
1,Don't waste your time or money,"Unfortunatelly this is one of john carpenters bad films. Most of the film is either stupid or predictable. The worst part is that this is one of those films were there is no hope for humanity, everyone in the planet will be slautered or posessed by the mars ghost. I would not recommend seeing, much less buying this movie."
1,Time to Change Channels,"Slow paced zombie slasher flic set on Mars with an atmosphere with much less tension, fear, and action than you'd get watching Sound of Music. Full length leather coat doesn't bring it any closer to sci-fi."
2,Seen once - never again,"This is the worst John Carpenter film I have ever seen.I can't believe that this is the same man who directed Halloween, The Thing, Dark Star and Escape from New York.Really it isn't even worth renting (which fortunately is all I did). Some space-cops land on Mars and have to face the title of the film. Every cliche in the horror/sci-fi book is used, to little effect, and the cast are at best average. To be fair to the cast the script is nothing special.I did get to the end of the film, which means it must have had a strange 'so bad its good' quality about it. My advice rent first, because you will probably be disappointed by this."
2,More ho-hum Carpenter.,"I've been a fan of JC's work for a long time. But he's gotten into a rut for a long time now, churning out forgettable movies that offer nothing but recycled plots. Generally his movies are worth a rental and a watch, and Ghosts of Mars follows this new tradition.John hasn't done anything truly creepy since Prince of Darkness. At least he's gotten off his soapbox and knocked-off the politically motivated ""They Live"". But I guess I'll continue to watch his efforts even if he's apparently never going to do anything to equal ""Dark Star"" or ""The Thing"".Rent it, watch it, take it back and forget it."
3,Ghosts of Precinct 13!,"John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars is basically John Carpenter'sAssault on Precinct 13 updated and moved to Mars, butwriter/director/composer Carpenter still makes it interesting withhis stylish touch.The plot here is your basic Western -- Fort Apache (here a Martianmining town) is under siege by Indians (here miners possessed byMartian spirits) and the Cavalry (the cops) must join forces withthe outlaws (Ice Cube and his gang) to fight'em off and survive.The bonus materials on this DVD are not too special. Thecommentary by Carpenter and Natasha is rather [bad}, more aboutthemselves than the movie. But the image quality is very goodand so is the music score. And I like this movie, despite itsfamiliarity. I recommend it to all Carpenter fans!"
5,Some of Carpenter's best work,"I love Carpenter's classics like Halloween, The Fog, Vampires, Christine, and The Thing! Ghost Of Mars was a diferent experience! The special features were good especially the scoring of ghost of mars! The scoring was awesome because, Anthrax and Buckethead did the music! The movie itself was great because, of the plot, acting, and of course the gore! This had limbs flying all over the place! This is some of Carpenter's best work since Halloween! Check it out and while your at it check out some of Anthrax and Buckethead's albums!"
4,MUCH better than expected,"Despite a terrible collection of reviews this is a damn entertaining film and well worth watching. A good ""people under siege"" film with lots of action and a tongue in cheek style it's great fun. VERY unfairly dismissed it's one of Carpenter's better films and deserves a fresh look. Better than Escape From LA this DVD is a good presentation with a great commentary track and some informative behind the scenes features. Don't listen to the critics, it's a very entertaining movie with comic book characters that are never dull. I think Carpenter was spot on with this film and a lot of people missed the point. It's not meant to be serious, it's a fun-fair ride and works well when viewed on that level. Give it a go. Worth buying for sure."
1,Who green lit this mess?,"Did the producers of this ""film"" (and I use the term ""film"" very loosely) actually think they had something of value on their hands? Did they consider that there might be some intelligence sitting in the showing room? Did they hope to even ""break even"" with box office receipts?I won't be a ""spoiler"" to those that wish to view it but I will add that there is a great predictability factor present. One example is labeling two characters as ""rookies"". I knew then that those two would have a short onscreen ""life span"".You can spot the plot inconsistencies MILES before they occur. There are so many unanswered questions by the end of the picture that one might wonder if the screenwriter had finished primary school.Fortunately for Pam Grier, her screen time is limited. I'm sure that she would love to disassociate herself with this, shall we say, lump of coal."
1,Pure Garbage,"I rented this movie thinking ""It can't be all that bad, Ebert & Roeper gave it two thumbs up."" I will never make that mistake again. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen - the kind of movie I would expect an adolescent boy to write, even worse than Starship Troopers (although if you liked that, you'd probably love this one). The dialog stunk, the acting was horrible, there wasn't one redeeming quality. It will definitely gain a spot on my all-time worst movie list."
2,Carpenter needs to retire...,"There is a big difference between a true horror film that knows restraint (i.e. The Shining) and a horror film with nothing more than Marilyn Manson groupie look-a-likes parading around an artificial set of Mars with facial piercings and killer hub-caps.John Carpenter's Ghosts Of Mars decided to choose the latter and ultimately fails to generate any scares while taking itself way too seriously to even generate campy entertainment value.It could have been a very cool movie had the budget been raised from the expendature of a Wendy's Kids Meal, because there are a few cool gore and decapitation scenes, not to mention a near ingenious concept (Angry spirits of long-dead martians possess nearby humans etc.) and a killer soundtrack by Anthrax and Buckethead, but those alone can't improve the quality of Carpenter's latest fiasco."
2,Predictable...Weird...Just Plain DUMB,"I saw this movie over at a friend's house and I thought I was actually going to like it. I like John Carpenter, I think he's a genius when it comes to horror movies, but this one was a doozy!! Ghosts of Mars is weird and very very predictable. You pretty much know exactly how it's going to end as soon as the movie begins. It was not scary at all, it was just plain boring. I was just praying for it to be over! Natasha Hendrige needs to stay away from Sci-Fi, she was only good in Species. Ice Cube got on my nerves! Pam Grier wasn't even needed, I have no clue why she decided to be in this movie. Don't waste your time with this one..."
3,Carpenter's Back Again!,"Like Michael Myers, just when you think John Carpenter's dead, he comes right back with another celluloid shell-shocker! I didn't like this one as much as Vampires, but it was still a pretty fun cheese-ball movie. Nothing quite in the vain of The Thing or Halloween, but still a fun entertainment piece with cool music and lots of action and decapitations. The setting and mood of the movie are also very well-done."
3,A shallow plot that could have been saved,"I had no idea what to expect from this movie, since I've never seen one by John Carpenter before.There was too much gore for me to like it. The plot and the actors had quite a bit of potential to make this an awesome movie. However, there were so many inconsistencies in the plot that it made it less and less believable. (E.g. Why didn't any of them explore how Ballard fought the ""germs."")Ballard (N.H.) and her fellow officers go to this town to transfer a convict, Desolation Williams (Ice Cube). They soon realize that something is wrong in the town - you have decapitated heads on poles, people hanging by their feet, etc. And the action starts. The perpetrators are miners who have been infected by these... what should I call them... evil germs who have the planet's memories somehow engineered in them.Like I said, the movie had potential. If you're going to watch this, watch it with no expectations."
2,2 stars because it made me laugh,"The absurdity of this movie made me laugh quite a bit. The sets were cheap, the plot (if you can call it that) was clunky, and the direction stank. A lot of people who have reviewed this already are railing on the actors, and the only reason I don't is because I have seen most of the main cast (the ones on the front cover) do very well in other roles. It is evident that they really weren't given much to work with.If you're looking for a horror flick to laugh at and make fun of in Mystery Science Theater 3000 fashion, this would be a good one to pick up. If you're looking for good sci-fi/horror, look elsewhere."
1,Ghosts of Mars,"This movie is stupid.The plot could work and the actors might work. Of course,they might have to smudge their makeup and then they mightmiss lunch.I saw Carpenter describing his artistic vision for the film. What a crock."
3,Not bad but mostly common sense,"Personally, I find most of the information from this book to be common sense. Like for example not picking your teeth at the table in the restaurant, or not criticizing your daughter-in-law, or not putting down your siblings in front of others.But then again, what's common sense for some, could be new to others. We are all different.First part of the book is dedicated to family and family relationships, followed by children's manners in the second part, then it talks about outside world, making friends, workplace etiquette, then talks about travel and tipping. Then there are chapters on dress code, common courtesies, dating, engagement, weddings, pregnancies, births, funerals and other events. The book pretty much touches upon any subject you can think of. It's not a bad book at all, it's just that I didn't find anything new there."
5,Great Resource Book,"Great resource book for the family. I already owned an earlier version and I purchased the new version as a Christmas gift for my grandchildren, ages 17,15,and 13."
3,Thought it would be interesting,"I thought I might be reading something that I disn't know from the late and great Laticia Baldriige, but it turned out to be nothing new and, as a matter of fact, a little tiresome. It's OK, but I guess I was expecting something more."
5,new manners for new times,"I received this book quickly and it was in great shape!I haven't finished reading it yet, but it is very informative so far."
5,Letitia Baldrige's New Manners for New Times: A Complete Guide to Etiquette,"Ms. Baldrige is a great writer, full of wit and wisdom. This book does not disappoint. Still very current on manners in the 21st century."
2,are you serious?,I collect etiquette books and love to study it. I could not believe Ms.Baldrige actually advocate eating a clam from the shell with your fingers and sucking a mussel out of its shell with your lips! I didn't finish the book as just this one excerpt undermined her authority on the subject!
4,Living up to the past,"This is a really good album from a band with a great history. If you like this, try their ""Interbabe Concern"" - one of my favorites, it's chock full, a masterpiece. And by all means, see them live; they're one of the great acts."
4,Better Half of Album is Fantastic,"I wrote a harsher review below. Hate to admit that I'm wrong. But I think I was. I saw TLF live last night and I've reevaluated some of the material on the record.I still think about half of it doesn't work, that the album's not as full of brilliance as ""Days For Days"" or ""Interbabe Concern"" had been. But the better half of it is a progression forward and a great set of material. ""Soul DC"" is a great moody hopeful track that ranks with their best. I now agree with what someone says below - this is a good album by a great band."
3,Not Their Best,"The songs here are pretty retro. This reminds me of the last Game Theory album, ""2 Steps From the Middle Ages"", which I also found a bit stale though with moments of brilliance. There are moments of greatness here - ""Save Your Money"" is a perfect little song, and the bridge in ""Backwards Century"" reaffirms that at times songwriter Scott Miller retains a brilliance that places him at the vanguard of pop songwriters, all-time. But he seems to be losing inspiration. Hope it comes back, either in the near term or the long term."
5,A must read for anyone who cares about the future of America,"The information found in this book cannot be found on your nightly news, nor can it be found at any college or university. Unless you went through school before 1962, you probably don't know the truth about what our great nation was founded on. This is the most outstanding book I have ever read (or heard of) concerning Free Enterprise and the founding principles of our country. I'm surrounded by literally millions of books every day and still have not come across a book quite like it! ---'..Why stand we here idle?!' It's time that we start turning things around in this country! It's time that we stand together and form this 'freedom tide' that Chad talks about! We have an obligation to preserve our nation's Godly heritage.. So that 50 years from now our children's children can each still stand and say that they are 'Proud to be an American!'"
5,Enjoyment and Enlightenment A+++++++,Connelly's writings are an inspirational call to ALL Americans. His factual views are referenced thoroughly. It is truly sad what we are not told in the school systems. This book touched me and TAUGHT me. Americas true foundation IS the people. A MUST read for every American who wishes enlightenment!!!!
5,Genius!,"Excellent! Genius! If genius is ""taking the complex and making it simple"", then this author is a genius. The book causes one to think...to act. Very Compelling...mandatory reading."
5,A Simple Historical Perspective,"Do you remember ever studying about William Bradford and the original Plymouth Colony in your history classes? Ever think the media or politicians took the phrase ""separation of church and state"" out of context? Looking for a simple explanation of liberal vs conservative? How about a simple definition of free enterprise? This book has all that and more...my 21 and 19 year old sons loved this book too. I'm naive enough to believe with Mr Connelly that we can make a difference in returning this country to the moral high ground of our founding fathers. Must read........"
4,"NEC 1760V, 17"" LCD Monitor, Black","My first experience with an LCD monitor. Very sleek design, light and compact. The display colors are bright and text resolution is very good. The buttons are on the front; easy to reach but hard to read. No dead pixels that I could tell. Seems to work well with Medal of Honor. Downside: text will blurr while scrolling vertically (such as internet search results). Also, the white background seemed to have a slight pinkish hue but to be fair, I didn't try using the color adjustments. All in all, an excellent monitor at a very reasonable price."
1,Very Poor Color,"At work, we just bought a load of these. Myself, and my co-worker, both Web designers, are working with these. But, I am lucky as I have a Mac 20inch flat screen as my primary workstation. My buddy just has the NEC monitor. Anyways, side by side comparison really shows how poor these monitors are. If you are doing graphic work, stay far away from these monitors - you will not see the finer details in slight color differences and gradients, etc. Good for the average Joe, but designers be warned... you will not be satisfied. We tried everything to adjust the monitor to no avail."
5,Satisfied Grandma,"I purchased it for my first Grandchild and although I have not seen it myself, my son and his wife liked it very much."
1,This is NOT Larry Fast SYNERGY,"If Larry Fast doesn't know there is a group using the name SYNERGY he should be told. The music is NOT electronic but rather an attempt by westeners to play Japanese music.I am not a fan of this music but it is enjoyable and different. Buy it if you like drums, flute and koto. Not if you like Larry Fast."
5,Works fine!,"My wife was sanding our stair steps when the rubber in the sander's plate disintegrated (it was old). When a search of local hardware stores revealed that no one had a replacement, we discovered it being available on amazon! Price was great as was the service. Recommended!"
3,"didn't look the same as online, but...","I received these very quickly. Beerpaw has excellent customer service. The shoe is definitely a size smaller than it states and the calf is narrow. I couldn't fit my jeans into them. I also did not like that the shoe portion was fur. Overall a nice looking shoe, but not what I expected so I sent them back."
3,Looks better online...,"I like the design of the boot, they look great- sturdy and warm. They really are lined with fur on the inside and they are warm- worn in autumn so far.Wearing them though, the sole was not as sturdy or thick as it looks online and they don't have as much cushioning as I expected. After half day of standing and walking, my legs began to feel uncomfortable. An option would be to insert a jelly, but then I'd lose the feel walking on fur. Another con is that the toe area is on the flat side, my toes get a little claustrophobic- can't wiggle around and enjoy the fur feel.It's an ok boot in itself. I feel that for the price, it should be more comfortable to wear- more cushion in the sole and a more roomy toe.I would have returned them if I hadn't worn them for that day."
2,Discolored,"My niece was looking forward to these boots so much for her birthday, and was dismayed (to say the least) when they had a yellow color to them instead of being white or off-white as in the product picture. I do not know if it's something to do with the way someone stored this item, but I would be very careful in retaining your receipt if you purchase these boots. I think they are really cute, and I know someone else that has them and LOVES them (and they're not discolored), so I hope no one runs into this problem!"
3,bearpaw woman's kola 1 or 2?????,I ordered the bearpaw 1 boots for my daughter for christmas. they came and one boot was defectively sewed(left boot)sent them back for an exchange and the girl at davinci shoes said i am better off with the 2. we had ordered a size 7 and changed it to an 8. sent back priority mail $7.40 and a 10.00 check for the 2 since they were more money & shipping. Received the new boots today and they fit just fine but retailer tried to bill me again for a 2nd set of boots. It seems that they had complaints about the bearclaw 1 so they try to get more money by having you purchase the 2. Beware!I hope they don't think they are getting any more money from me because i'm done!
2,BearPaw Kola,Beautiful boot...however HORRIBLE customer service with company shoe was bought from.For that reason alone I must not give it a good rating. The boot was beautiful.I wouldn't suggest dealing with Shoe City.
5,Very attractive,"I have been looking for an after ski Boot that is attractive, affordable, and of real fur...Have not worn them yet as we go skiing this December, but can tell you they are very comfortable and beautiful..I did have to return for the next size as they run small... Love the look!!!!"
1,Who could possibly get their foot in!,"I received this boot as a gift. Its being returned immediately. The opening on the top of the boot is so small, I can almost get my foot in. But then the shaft of the boot is so tight that my foot wont go all the way in. Forget about wanting to tuck in your pant leg...no way. There needs to be a zipper or something unless your a habitual legging wearer. So cute, but not wearable :{"
1,"great brand, sad fit","I love the bearpaw brand, but sadly this particular style doesn't just run small, it could cripple. When these boots arrived I was totally psyched, but when I tried them on (1/2 size larger than I wear) I lost layers of skin off the top of my foot. In the end felt like one of the ugly stepsisters attempting to try on the glass slipper....yeow! I'll continue to buy bearpaw, just not any boot/shoe with this design. Needless to say these have since been returned."
1,Gross,"A friend of mine bought me these. Frankly, I was disgusted. She was uneducated about fur trading and trapping, and after I had showed her what the fur industry is REALLY like, she was appalled. Fur is disgusting. How would you like someone breaking into your house, stealing your children, and SKINNING them (alive) to decorate their feet. It's gross."
2,They look better on the picture,Honestly i was expecting a bit better quality of the shoes than i have received.Thankfully i ordered the size 6 (mine is 4/5 - 5)The color is much darker than on the picture ( i ordered the color chestnut)and i have to take a glue out of edges stitches (between the sole and fur).One plus: they are very comfortable.Another plus for fast delivery.
5,great boot,"My husband thinks they are sexy. My calves are 16"" and these barely fit. I will not be able to tuck them in jeans. My shoe size is 7 and I bought an 8. They fit. These run wide in the toe area which works for me but they run short from toe to heel, thus a larger size was needed. They are great looking and comfortable. So warm. I love them so much I went back for a second pair in another color. I recommend Street Moda as a seller. Great prices and no problems with the shipping.I now have this boot in black and chestnut and so love them both! Both came from Street Moda,good seller! I am now getting the white from another amazon seller since street moda is out. I hope they are as good!I now have the white as well. They are so beautiful. These boots are all the same size 8 but they all fit a bit differently. No matter, they are all comfortable and a great value!Shoe city shipped the last pair...get some!"
5,nice comfort,"Love this pair of booots, size ran a little small, so would order next size up. very happy with them, maybe some day will get another pair in a differnt color"
1,DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE - did not credit my return,"i ordered these boots a few months ago and they turned out to be the wrong size. not what i expected because they ran small. i returned them, finally got the email that they were credited, but until this day have NOT received my refund. contacted seller AND amazon.. and nothing. ridiculous."
2,Already holey,"After only about a month of daily use these boots already have cracks and holes in the upper where your toes bend. :( I love the look of the boots but the function is lacking. The feathers did come off, but based on the other reviews, I was expecting that. The feathers don't contribute to the function but of course the structure of the upper does."
2,More size issues,"I was pretty excited to see these marked down in Marshall's, and even happier to see that they had a pair in exactly my size (6.5).Unfortunately, I too had fit issues. I couldn't even get my foot through the incredibly narrow, inflexible calf opening. So no go. A zipper or some elastic might make this work, but just look at the image; you can see how constricting that band is.I'd love to see a remake of this in something that zipped, tied, had frogs...something to allow me to get my foot in!"
5,Sweetness is this Sander,"I just used this little beauty to prep a pine table and it was pure pleasure. Quality of materials and performance was outstanding. The vibration was minimal. The separate wrench to load the sandpaper was initially a mild surprise but was NOT awkward to use (although I suppose one could lose it). If you would enjoy a product that surpasses your expectations for a change, then this is the stuff."
2,IMPOSSIBLE TO CHANGE THE PAPER,"The sander sands great! However, if you need to change the sandpaper, it's near impossible to manipulate the clips. The amount of strength and dexterity required is way past my hands, my dad's hands and anyone who isn't a gym rat would find it difficult. Since it sands so well, purchased the ""stik it"" pad replacement pad, thus solving the problem, but there shouldn't have been a problem. This is a poor design. The stik it pad requires stik it sandpaper which is much more expensive. I've used up several Sears sanders, with less painful paper changes. The idea was to buy a better sander that would last longer, but I'm not at all sure how much I'll be using this after all. A disappointment."
2,Porter Cable 330,I had purchased Porter-Cable 330 Speed Bloc 1.2 Amps 1/4 Sheet sander. I find the sander heavy and there is a need to improve on the clip that holds the sanding paper. The existing design is very difficult in the replacement of sanding sheets. I am greatly disappointed in this Porter-Cable design and handling ability.
1,Hot potato,"This is a very heavy constructed piece of equipment. It feels good in your hand,although it feels twice as heavy as my Bosch,which means that you don't have to apply any pressure to sand as the weight of the machine does a good job of that. The vibration is substantially less than my Bosch,but it gets so hot that you can only use it a few minutes before you have to let it cool down for 20 minutes. I tried to use it longer, thinking that it would reach a peak and I could bear that,but that is not the case ,it just keeps getting hotter and hotter and hotter. It would be good for frying eggs,and making coffee."
2,3 failures in 3 years,"Works nice when it works, which is not very often.I've had 3 separate failures in 3 years of occasionalhobbyist use. I have now spent more on ordering partsfor this POS than I spent on the original sander."
3,Porter Cable cheapens sander,"This is second 330 Speed Bloc sander I've owned. In the interval between the first purchase and the second, PC has changed the flexible power cord to a stiff kinky cord that doesn't ever lay flat, catches on the edge of the work bench as the sander is moved over the work and is a trip hazard when sander cord is resting on the floor. It has become such a frustration that I will find and replace the cord. I hate what PC has done to this otherwise great tool."
4,A very good sander,"I've only owned this for a couple of days, but I really like it. I've used it for quite a few hours the other day. I'm usually worn out from the B&D I'm used to, so this is a pleasant change. This thing is really quiet, for a palm sander, that is. I understand the issues with the needing of the tool, and the design of the clamp is pretty foreign to me, but it is something I've gotten used to. Also, the pad is wider than the 1/4 sheets, so there is a minimal hangover, but no biggie. I was kinda worried about purchasing this, but now I'm glad I did. The design of the tool itself is much more comfortable than the standard design, I can go for hours. I haven't been able to do that in years. I hope this one works for a long time."
5,Outstanding service for 30 years,"I bought my Porter Cable 330 Block Sander in 1970 and it has performed flawlessly for 30 years. I am only now replacing the four small rubber posts that insulate the upper housing from the vibration of the pad. This sander uses only 1/4 of a sheet of sandpaper, but is, nevertheless, a high quality, durable machine that can be operated continuously without failure. It is an orbital sander, not a random orbital or vibrating sander, and uses three separate sealed roller bearings - two on the armature and one on the pad. It is a tough machine, built to handle sanding chores in areas where larger sanders either won't fit or are too cumbersome and akward to use, such as sanding on the sides and bottoms of drawers."
5,A top performer that's reliable and quiet,"The Speed-bloc is very well built and much quieter than ordinary palm sanders. It does an excellent job and due to it's lower than normal vibration, doesn't put your hand to sleep in the process. This machine is comfortable to grip and the on/off switch is conveniently located. Changing paper is quick and easy (with or without the little tool they provide). The Speed-bloc is an excellent old design that Porter-Cable was smart enough to leave alone."
1,"Hillary Haters, You'll love this book","Beth Harpaz's book has the wrong title. It should be titled ""One Girl on the Van.""The author spends much of the book giving details about her personal life.her kids, her mother(!) and her husband.Those other girls on the van got short shift from Harpaz.But most importantly so does Hillary Clinton. Hartaz has a never-ending list of complaints about the way she was treated by Hillary and her aides. It was all so personal and vindictive.As an example, Harpaz mentions that Hillary hates being photographed when she is eating....so Hartaz includes a photo of the First Lady eating a gigantic sandwich.... Little touches like that which make this book [bad]."
2,Unsatisfying,"This book makes a lot out of its relation to its predecessor, Tim Crouse's seminal The Boys On The Bus. But there is little here to compare the two. Following a state senate race is nowhere near as interesting to read about as a national election. After all, Harpaz gets to go home to her children and she often brings egg salad sandwiches to work. I'm sure Hillary is just as interesting a subject as McGovern but Harpaz is not as interesting a person as Crouse. Crouse was tough, and the other reporters tougher, a strange group of misanthropic (...). Harpaz and her compatriots sing songs and whittle away the days complaining about their inability to get access to their candidate. The best thing about this book is that it does take you inside the campaign, and it does tell you what it is like to be a reporter, stylistically though the prose is just dead."
4,Quite a awsome cd,"I too am a beginner didge player, and i mainly bought this cd as a tool to help me get ideas to improve my playing, so you kinda have to have expieriance with this cd to really enjoy it. But i love it. The drone of the didge has always amazed me and David Hudson does a awsome job of capturing the beauty of the didge."
3,High School Musical,"High School Musical, The Concert - Extreme Access PassI both this product for my daughters, she love the group and their musical"
3,Disappointed in this new extreme line,Well I am glad I got the movie from netflex cause the movie was less then a hour and not all songs from the real concert was shown?The backstage stuff was nothing.
5,One of my all time faves,"If you like black comedy, rock n' roll and road movies, watch this! Worth the price of admission to see Jello Biafra playing a US Customs agent. Don McKellar stars and also helped write it I think. Small town barber and aspiring musician Pokey finds a dead body behind his shop. Jackie runs away from the band she has been a roadie for, with something of theirs. She meets Pokey and uses him and the body to accomplish her objective. They embark on a road trip from Ontario to New Orleans along Highway 61, encountering eccentrics along the way. The plot thickens when a guy who thinks he is the devil wants the body, believing he owns the soul and wanting to claim it."
2,DVD review,"Item was received timely and in perfect condition.I was unaware of the subject matter totally, and was disappointed in the DVD; but not in the delivery of the item itself.I've given this DVD to a brother to get his view of the subject."
4,Legacy? ....couldve been better,"First things first. i was hoping the Legacy Edition wouldve taken out the annoying 'I Was Born 10,000 Years Ago' snippet that's inbetween every song when they remastered but nope, its still there. It throws off the rhythm and is annoying to say the least. But ASIDE from that this is one of Elvis's best albums. Probably his best of the 70's. Well, its actually two, 'Country' and the second disc is 'Love Letters' with somne bonus cuts thrown in there. 'Country' is amazing Tomorrow Never Comes, I Don't Want to Know, Whole Lotta Shakin' all feature some of Elvis's best vocals ever. its not strictly country but its great. Theres a little filler here and more filler on second disc but still good........"
5,Wife Loves it,"My wife is a die hard Elvis fan. She has every movie that has been released and though that she had every song; however, this legacy edition has a few very rare early songs done by the king that she didn't have in her multitude of Elvis ""stuff"". She is very pleased with this set...and I sleep well at night."
5,A Presley Concept Album,"""Elvis Country"" remains one of Presley's best and most enduring albums. It's certainly his finest studio LP of the 1970s. For perhaps the only time in his career, Elvis chose to make a concept album that reflected his eclectic taste in rock, blues, country and gospel. As a result, ""Elvis Country"" has a seamless quality that cannot be found on any other Presley album. Every track is a gem -- from the passionate ""Tomorrow Never Comes"" to the jam-session atmosphere of ""Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On"" to the stirring poignancy of ""Make the World Go Away."" You can hear Elvis' mastery from beginning to end. In retrospect, ""Elvis Country"" is Presley's most rewarding studio album as well as a timeless personal statement."
1,Item # PCD4003TS Cheap is Right,"Cheap is right! I could buy a better looking watch at a discount store.This watch is extremely cheap looking and I am not that picky. My old scracthed up watch looks better than this one. The band looks more gold than 2 tone and I was very disappointed since that is what I liked about the watch in the first place. What diamonds? You would need to magnify them to see them. You want glimmer, buy sequins instead. Item # PCD4003TS"
3,Different from the pictures,"This watch looks great in the pictures, but not live. the crystals are tiny and don't shine. For the price I didn't expect diamonds, but I expected the look to be better."
2,Cheap Looking,"The product has a cheap looking, only the bracelet looks good. Not recomended, I'm realy disapointed."
1,the picture is faked,when I saw the watch on the website it looks like a fancy watch but in fact it is just a watch that you can have it from anystore. I do not recommend it.
1,Wrong designation of item,This item is not correctly identified!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Actually what I received was a 25Ft Cat 6 cable!!!!! I lost a job on this project!!!!NOTE! I ORDERED THIS ITEM 2 TIMES!!!!!Same results
1,Don't buy this CD,This Cd is a waste of your money and time the artist dosen't even sing on this cd. IT SUX
3,Great but flawed,"This is a very good saw, but suffers from a flaw which makes me hate it as much as I like it. I have never used a tool which has such an ability to blow dust into my eyes (I am right handed and view my cut from the left of the saw). I wonder how Porter cable could let such a flaw go out the door when it would be so easy to fix. After much frustration, I finally taped a piece of sandpaper over the left fan slot deflecting dusty air down instead of up. Would I buy this saw again? No."
3,Good saw but flawed,"I have had this saw for over a year now and am considering purchasing a different brand for two main reasons; 1)as mentioned in another review, this saw seems to aim dust in your eyes. It doesn't seem to matter where you place your head, weather the dust blowing switch is on or off (I see NO difference when this switch is on) or if you are wearing eye protection. I believe there is a vacum attachment but I have not tried this. 2) Tool-less blade change does not necessarily make it pain-less. The blade changing system is at best awkward and clunky. This is particularly a problem if you try to change a hot blade. It's too bad because this is an otherwise solid tool as is usual with porter cable; good ergonomics, well built, plenty of power, durable. Try out the blade changing system, if you like it and don't mind some extra dust in your face, it's a fine choice."
2,Blade change faux pas,"Bought this saw yesterday based on my long and happy experience with several other Porter Cable Tools, even though I had trouble with the blade change in the store. Error! Practice at home got me sore fingers and frustration. Finally figured out (actually, my neighbor figured out) that if you pull the blade out at an angle to the side while pulling to the front and squeezing the tabs (!)it is easier to remove - not easy, but easier. Insertion remains a problem. Unacceptable for ... saw.Oh - 6'1"" 240#, in construction for 20 years; never actually been accused of being a wimp, but I am getting older. Not with this tool though - going back for the Bosch tomorrow."
4,Powerful!,This is a very powerful jig saw. It cuts really good. I use it for most work as substitute for my circular saw. I found high quality Bosch T shank blades work great on this saw. The thing I hate is the clunky quick change system. But when I use the saw I forget about this problem. It does blow dust but I don't care about it as long as the saw is great. That'swhy I am giving it only four stars.
2,I don't like it,"Yes, it blows the dust right in your face, and mouth. It works great if you use it with your arm outstretched and don't need to look at what your cutting.My buddy used it too, now he needs to buy new contact lenses for his eyes. Evidently he wasn't using it at his full arms length.Buy the Bosche."
2,Porter Cable Jig Saw,"I expected a little more from this tool. As much as I tried, I couldn't get the blade in and out of it's finger 'chuck'. This shouldn't be diffucult - blade changes should take only a few seconds and yet try as I did, it wouldn't come out. After a lot of trying and finally forcing it out, it was time to return the unit. Maybe mine was defective, but I am not happy about it, or the additional time and effort I expended in this experience."
4,Great jig saw,"This is an accurate and powerful saw. I would agree with most posts that say the saw throws wood into your face BUT the Bosch T101BR blades solve this problem. These blades have the teeth reversed so they cut on the down stroke and consequently throw the dust downward. These are a great all purpose blade and a pack of 5 is $9 at Lowe's (less online). Also, after a few blade changes you get a hang of removing blades and blades reinstall with ease. Couldn't be happier with this saw and would highly recommend it. -Todd"
3,"good, but could be better","I read all the reviews I could find and despite several reviews that spoke poorly of the dust problem, I bought it anyway. Mistake..... I returned it in two days. The tool-less blade change and bevel are great features and work well, but the dust blowing in my face with or without chip blower on was too much for a tool in that price range. Other brands (like Makita) have a clear chip deflector on the front. Another feature that is odd- the lower blade support does not pivot with the base when you do a bevel. you have to rotate it by hand. It will also wear the sides of the blade if not lined up. I looked real hard at the Bosch but don't want that either... I'll try the Makita 4304t and see how that goes."
5,G.I.Elvis,"What an appropriate album and a movie with Elvis fresh out of the army.Avery good spirited soundtrack,it had the rockers Blue Suede Shoes,the lulabye,Big Boots,the upbeat,Shoppin Around,Frankeufurt Special,the ballad Doin T he Best I can,and the beautiful love ballad ,Pocket Full Of Rainbows,and the closer Didja Ever.Of course we can't overlook Wooden Heart.Good songs,happy times ,superbly performed by the greatest."
4,"""I'm So Happy"" AND Confused","I just love this song! I heard it on the radio two or three times before I listened to the whole CD. But I'm confused. Is Sting the only person who ever recorded this song? Anyone! I could've sworn the version I heard was by Hal Ketchum. Maybe I was dreaming. Does anyone know who wrote this song?Anyway, this is a fine mini selection of music, and so atypical of Sting, I think. Sting's one-of-a-kind voice really shines in both ""I'm So Happy"" and in ""This Was Never Meant to Be,"" and this CD shows us what a broad range of music Sting is capable of performing and performing quite well.And I gotta say, I really love this short CD format, too. Here's to there being more of these short CDs to come!"
1,I HATE THIS SONG !!,I hear this damn happy song at work atleast 10 times a day!!! I hate it..... it is the worse Sting has ever put out!!! I'M NOT HAPPY!!
5,I love the characters in this book!,"I loved this book for its characters, especially Little Nell. In fact, when I think of Dickens and his work, Little Nell is the character that comes to mind. She so embodies everything that he wrote about in all his wonderful books. The plot in this book is a little simpler than some of his plots. It centres around Little Nell and her grandfather's search throughout the roads and fields of England for a home where they can live happily and comfortably. The book has been accused of being ""schmaltzy"" and perhaps it is, but the ending is actually quite sad. It's a heartwarming book, and I think a good introductory book to Dickens and his works. Read this one, and then try tackling some of the other, more complex ones. That's my advice."
3,Flawed but entertaining,"This is perhaps Dickens' least successful novel from a modern standpoint. It simply doesn't hold together, as the author changes his mind about the book's direction a few times during its serial publication; changes the nature of certain characters along the way; and reveals the narrator's identity at the end (always a mistake) when in fact it is most unlikely that this particular character could have known half of what went on in the book. Modern readers will find it quite sentimental, but then it made Dickens hugely popular in his day, and is not without memorable characters as always, among them the quasi-demonic Daniel Quilp. Quilp seems to do evil for no particular reason other than that he himself is evil, therefore the book offers little pointed social critique. Dickens is nothing if not entertaining, however, and he is always worth a look."
3,The Old Curiosity Shop,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book as I was never able to read the classics when I was young. Now, I'm really enjoying the opportunity partly because they have been offered free of charge. Thanks, Amazon. Old English is difficult to read, but I like having the chance to know how they used our English language during that time period. Some pages I would have to read several times just to figure out what their meaning was. However, this book will keep you reading until the end because of it's story line."
2,I stumbled to get through any of it,"Yes, I stumbled to get through any of it. To be honest, I didn't even finish the book. I loved A Tale of Two Cities, but this one put me to sleep. Yes, the characters were intriguing, but that was it. I saw hardly any plot. I had to plow through meaningless little scenes till I got to about 100 or so and the plow blade got stuck in a drift of snow. The language was nice, but the plot was not. I will give him the benefit of the doubt because he wrote so many other good novels. Every author is bound to have a flop, and to me, this one flopped, big time."
3,The Old Curiosity Shop C.Dickens,"Obviously one can't fault the content. Dickens is Dickens. BUT who did the typing, and where was the proof reader? There are MANY typographical errors, right from the start. These are primarily words which will not be picked up by spell checks, as they are correct English words, just not the correct ones for the context."
3,ok for Dickens,"After having read Great Expectations and Tale of Two Cities (and loving both), I thought any old Dickens would do me good. This one was just ok, it takes a bit to get into it, and parts of it are slow, by the end I was glad I had read it, but also glad it was over."
1,Bad copy!,"This is a crap edition with tons of typos, which is a real shame. Even for free I expected more."
3,using for meditation,This was purchased because of the tile game monjong and some of the inca sound from that at low volume it is a good meditation music for bak ground consintration to block out other noise and some what relaxing as a study of south america I am always intrested in the culter and music of old and tieing it into what they call the incas ware i understand that this is more a spain and new world term they were not incas but much more
3,Over priced book,Don't buy this book unless you plan to read it to a 3 year old. I read it and feel like that was 4 minutes I'll never get back. It's mostly glorified pictures with little information. I highly recommend this book to anyone I do not like.Mental furball rating of 10
1,Terrible costume- even worse customer service,"My wife found this product on Amazon, and it seemed the perfect costume for my daughter's 5 y.o b.day. Shipping was fast, then came the big day. We didn't expect the highest quality, but at least something that would last maybe 10-20 uses... unfortunately within half an hour of use (my daughter is a very girly-type... no rough play at all), the metallic blue in the skirt started rubbing off. Then the same with the cape. By the end of the evening, the costume was ragged, and unusable. The blue and red sheen on the skirt and cape had worn off in big patches.I emailed the company at their website [...] not once but 3 times now. No response. I'm frustrated more at the lack of response from the company than the costume itself. I realize sometimes your just going to get a cheap ""made in China"" product, but to dodge accountability for you product is unsatisfactory."
3,from another planet,"I read once that this dude worked with John Cage. True or not, that should give you a sense of how out there this disc is. The interior cover art reveals that the nine songs are symbol-coded into three categories: ""blip,"" ""noise"" and ""groove."" This is no joke: a prime example of a ""noise"" track would be ""Arteries of Tokyo,"" which is literally a five-and-a-half minute recording of distant highway traffic. This record, in short, subscribes to the Cagean notion that music is anything that we choose to listen to.Now that said, Atau has been around for a while and the fact that ""Biorhythms"" is even listenable is a testament to his skills. ""Otaku"" and ""f:m:r"" are inventive grooves composed mostly of metal industrial hits and sawtooth synthesizers, and ""Adagio,"" an almost ten minute ambient string wash, is remarkably enjoyable. But this album is composed largely of sounds that most people think of as background noise, and background noise is quite quickly what it can become."
1,Does not fit 2008 JK,"This product does not fit a 2008 JK. The primary installation location as specified in the instructions ends up being over top of the plastic conduit at the top of the inside of the tailgate - of course that doesn't work. The alternate location is over the vents at the bottom of the inside of the tailgate - also wouldn't work. Vertically adjusting the installation location to compensate still produces a less-than-ideal installation, as the JK's tailgate placement relative to the body is different than earlier body types. When extended, the stopper does not contact the body an inch or so to the right of the edge of the body, as shown in the photos. Instead, on a JK, it contacts the body at the very edge, where the rubber gasket is. I would expect this problem to present itself on other model year JKs as well. Before you buy this, go look at your tailgate - if it doesn't look like the one in the photos, the stopper won't install well."
3,"some smoke, but no mirrors","a WONDERFUL tool, leave it to PC to come up with an improvement on someone else's idea. a great addition to my PC collection, however......... will someone enlighten me as to how the tile bit is supposed to work? All I get is melted glazing and tool-bits from heat and no cutting. 2 bits worn out trying to cut through 4"" of ceramic wall tile isn't what I'd call a wonderful thing, could do that much with my sawzall and a carbide blade or a pizza slicer as far as it goes. Plaster was as easy as drywall! 1/4"" luan plywood just burned, however. Do we need better instructions (since I'm apparently an idiot with a 121 IQ), or less hype and BS as it concerns what a tool will and won't do. I would have expected this from B&D."
5,As good a monitor as you can get.,"This monitor is one of the best investments we've ever made. The clarity of the picture is to die for. They've come down in price since we made our purchase, but I'd buy it again in a minute.Here it is, more than five years later, and it still works as good as ever. Well worth the investment!"
3,Very disappointing,"I already had Land of the Incas, and it's awesome. Then I got this and it's much less than awesome. The songs on here are generally uninteresting. If you're new to Inkuyo or to Peruvian-style music, get Land of the Incas instead."
1,Mistaken I.D.,"Hey, I bought this book along with Gravesend Light, assuming it was the same David Payne. Turns out, it's two different guys. So why are these things paired at Amazon?"
5,traditional musica ranchera,"If you are looking for a traditional musica ranchera from Mexico, this is a good CD. Production, arrangements and Jorge Fernandez' performance is an old fashion studio work, that will bring good memories to people who grew up with Miguel Acevez Mejia, Jorge Negrete or Pedro Infante.La Negra Noche song is one of my favourites, with almost ""a capella"" parts, and then a mariachi intervention, gives the song an strange and haunting effect."
3,Soft but too small,"I have tiny hands - part of the reason I wanted fur lined gloves is because they are constantly cold. After reading reviews here I ordered a size 7 when I usually wear a 6. The length of the fingers on the gloves are fine, the fur is very nice, but they are so tight I can't comfortable bend my hand. Which makes wearing the gloves and doing anything like driving uncomfortable. The leather was rather stiff, perhaps over time and constant use the leather would break in and be softer & stretch. But I need gloves now - winter - so I have returned these. This is one of the rare occasions when I've ordered something online and have had to return it for being too ~small~. Didn't see any fault in the quality of the item, just in the sizing."
2,Gloves arrived wet/mildewed; no response from seller,"I went out of my way to pay more for these thinking I'd get a better product. My gloves were shipped in a plastic sleeve in a cardboard envelope. The envelope got soaked en route and was quite damp and flexible like wet cardboard is when it was delivered. So the gloves got wet too. The plastic sleeve they were in was open on one end so it was no protection. The gloves must have been wet for days because they had a strong mildew smell when they arrived. I emailed the seller; asking how they recommend to get the smell out and THEY NEVER RESPONDED. The gloves still smell of mildew too. I guess that will never come out. So much for spending $90. I would never buy from this seller again.Had they not been wet and smelly, they'd only be marginally better. The leather is nice but the stitching is weak on the left glove and pulling when I put them on. Also, there isn't as much fur in the fingers as I expected for the price. In short, not recommended."
3,"Good in its time, but outdated","This is a cool little camera with an interesting look to the photos, but as of 2009 it is very outdated. Good for fun stuff, but quality not sufficient for printing."
4,It does what I bought it for,This is a 9 pin serial port that I need for a system for one of my customers. It does the job and not much more to say about it.
5,Excellent single slot COM port adapter,"Not much to be said about this which isn't already self-explanetory for those who are looking for these. It's simple, inexpensive, and does the job.If you need to put a COM port on the back of your computer case, using one of the expansion slot blades, and your motherboard uses the standard 9/10 pin header, then this is what you need. 9"" cable should provide all the length you need."
2,poorly designed,"This is called a Stikit pad, indicating that self-adhesive sandpaper should be used with it. It does not last long, as the self-adhesive paper tends to tear the cloth from the Pad. A hard rubber pad would work better."
1,Poor quality,"When you try to remove the self stick sand paper, it tears the backing away fronm the foam pad. Poor quality."
2,Porter-Cable 13597,"Once I received the pad, I found that it would not work on the sander that I had. It was difficult to tell from the picture that it would not work, and not worth the extra cost to send it back."
2,Stikit pad for 330,"Does not perform well at all, put my old pad back on and will return this one--way too soft backer and will tear the surface up removing the stikit paper"
5,Just like the 20 year old pad when it was new,My little 330 palm sander doesn't get a ton of use so when the old pad became soft and mushy I was glad to see that I could replace just the pad instead of the whole sander. It was easy to replace and my sweet little sander once again works like new!
1,The Effort Is Not Enough,"I am a huge fan of every facet of the James Bond phenomenon, the musical scores in particular. I am also a major consumer of electronic music of all types. Unfortunately, the two worlds don't tend to intersect well. David Arnold can pull it off because he combines traditional orchestration with subtle electronic enhancements to create a contemporary sound for his scores. On the other hand, Moby's take on the 'James Bond Theme' from 1997 was lame and uninspired. I didn't even need to buy this album to determine how bad it is (the five 30 second audio samples are plenty to judge by). I only posted a one star rating because zero wasn't an option. You'd be better off buying Arnold's ""Shaken And Stirred"" project or flushing your dosh down the loo. Carry on then."
1,NOT DUETS!,"I was so disappointed to get this CD set and found that it was not a Kenny/Dolly duet as the cover would lead you to believe, but instead two poorlymastered solo cds. Everything about it leads you to believe that it is Kenny and Dolly singing together! I wish I had listened to some of the demotracks, but I was so sure it was the duets, and I was excited about getting those. Buyer beware!!"
1,Disapointment,"When I saw the add for this I though Duets, When I got the product after a rather long delay, I was quick to play both CD to find out they were low quality recordings of Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers. Not a duet, but individual poorly mastered recordings on two cd. Kenny and Dolly are not even on the same CD, this is just packaging the two cd in the same box. This item should be on the .01 bargin bin not the price charged. If you enjoy Dolly and Kenny, I suggest other products. Amazon Pazzazz just does not make the grade"
3,Better understanding of Psychic Abilities,"I read this book that help me understand and grasp the concept that we all have psychic abilities, more than others. What responsabilities we have if we develop these abilities and how could we contribute to society. I recommend this book for people who want to understand if they have these abilities and the excercise are good to practice with. The author explains very well these excerise but it takes time to get into practice and focus on them."
5,"Fun little, portable kitchen","This kitchen stove/sink combo is great! My daughter has played with other kid size kitchens at her school but also loves this one just as much. It's a good size for kids, easy to move/portable and provides a lot of fun and learning. The food, pan and utensils are very sturdy and aren't cheaply made. My only complaint is the side table; it tends to come off; the hook on concept needs to be reevaluated as the hook part needs to be upside down or have wrap around hooks in order for it to stay on, but other than that it's a great toy. I also purchased the matching fridge and it compliments this toy nicely! Lots of fun---even I can't help playing with it sometimes!!!"
3,A hybrid,"Actually, 5 stars as a quick reference, 1 star as an administrator manual. This is a somewhat weird book. Heaven help any company when an administrator decides to switch a NT network to Linux, or set up Linux from scratch, with just this book. If everything goes well, the network will run, but if something goes wrong, good luck trying to recover. But curiously enough, it is usually the book I reach for if I can't remember exactly how setting something up works. Short, to the point coverage of how to install or setup things. But if your options don't include nuke-and-reinstall, find an administrator handbook somewhere to supplement it."
1,No Stars at all for a product that is NOT Treo 650 Compatible,"Received this item, and no wonder it was so cheap... The plug for connecting to the Treo 650 isn't a Tro 650 connection. Waste of a purchase, and yet so cheap not worth the trouble for a refund."
2,"Strong voice, not much to say","While Denezhkina's voice is clearly a strong one, her character development in these short stories simply isn't there. Characters float in and out of stories with minimal consequence. I look forward to seeing what she does in the future, but this book was a bit of a disappointment."
2,pad shelf life - poor,"The PC sander is a very worthy tool, but one note of caution: Don't order too many extra pads! The foam within the replacement pads have a - limited storage - life... a brand new (but aged) unused pad will fall apart or disintegrate. Grabbing for the last of several stored in the back of the cabinet (3 years) it immediately fell apart when installed. I was astonished! Especially since these are not cheap items. Apparently the R&D department at Porter Cable hasn't done their homework."
5,yes it is 5 or 8 hole,i wasn't sure if it would work as the picture shows 5 holes but it does work just as they say..
1,Expensive pad vs cost of tool - good tool expensive to service.,"Great sander, but the cost of replacement pads vs the initial cost of tool is expensive. Same problematic issue with all of the the Porter-cable random orbit sanders pads overtime the pad disinergrates leaving a working tool unusable."
4,Better choice,"Simple installation, the hole alignement works for 5 & 8 hole disks, which is very handy because you never know what is available at your local supplier. Strong adhesion."
4,Mine Broke!,"Went to sand a desk and the pad spun off, broke right off and went flying across the yard, now its fixed."
3,"Works OK, but ........","Like most things that are labeled as being ""universal replacements"" it's a compromise. I hook up a dust collector to the port on my ROS and keep dust in the shop to a minimum. I needed a replacement pad for my 333 and this one does the job. But it doesn't let dust or air flow through the slots as easily (resistance wise) as the original. When it wears out I probably will just toss the ROS.Jim"
5,Porter Cable Replacement Pad,This was a replacement to the Porter Cable sander. I was in the middle of a project and needed this ASAP. It arrived in a few days and I was able to finish. It fit right on and was perfect.
5,Fun Stuff,"This was not a great work of art that will live on long after we are gone. It is not full of political statements or hidden agendas that the Hollywood flicks are known for nowadays. It is simply a sweet, funny movie with no sex, drugs or violence. Some people may not get that. If you can not be entertained with out the above, this movie is not for you. Instead, if you want to find something that will make you laugh and take you on a fun ride, this would be a nice pick. Don't forget to hang in there for the credits. The song at the end should make you smile. :-)"
3,Phil's Monologue on stage,"You just gotta love Phil's monologue on stage when he was talking about bread. i like bread... white bread, brown bread, whole wheat.... partnered with the slide show behind him.I am not particularly a big fan of this movie. it's not a comfort movie, but sometimes you need to find a movie that does not require thinking but still satisfy your need to watch."
2,Almost worth a two-dollar rental.,"Ok, this movie wasn't bad I guess. I'd call it your basic time-killer. There's really not much of a story. I thought Luke Wilson and Denise Richards did a decent job, both playing their usual parts, but the ""third wheel"" guy was truly annoying. Ben Affleck had a small part too. Overall it was another movie I sat through waiting for Denise Richards to shed clothing, and I ended up with a one-second panty shot. So, only for fans of either star, or so-so romantic comedies."
2,Bad,It's hard for me to believe that people actually spent millions of dollars to make this movie. It simply wasn't at all interesting.
2,the chick-flick backlash,"An inaccessible drop dead gorgeous high-powered banker gal gives the dorky office guy a try, then turns out to be sweet and easy, and he doesn't have to lift a finger, even when her gruff ex confronts them can only mean one thing to me: A screenwriter's subscription to Maxim ran out and he had some free time."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"Made of feathers. Doesn't look like a flower, not sure what it looks like. If it wouldn't be more trouble than its worth, I'd return it."
4,"Great material, well-organized","There are tons of dialogues from different speakers, some of whom are very easy to understand and some of whom are a little more difficult. The book provides fully vowelled transcripts of all the dialogues. This is great practice for a lower-intermediate to intermediate student. Much better done that some of the other Arabic learning tools out there."
1,!!!WORTHLESS!!!,"!!!THIS BOOK IS UTTERLY WORTHLESS!!! WITHOUT AN ENGLISH TRANSLATION OF THESE TEXTS ONE HAS TO GUESS AT WHAT MUCH OF THE ARABIC MEANS, OR WORSE YET, LEAVE IT INCOMPREHENSIBLE!!! BY THE TIME YOU REACH THIS STAGE OF ARABIC YOU CAN ALREADY GET TRANSCRIPTS OF ARABIC SPEECHES ON YOUTUBE AND THE ENGLISH TRANSLATION FOR FREE!!! WHAT WERE THE AUTHORS THINKING??? ALL THEY DID WAS TRANSCRIBE SOME ARABIC CONVERSATIONS - BARELY A SERVICE!!! DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!!"
4,rythmic and captivating,"One of the few bands of the 80's techo-genre that was constantly exploring new tempos and experimental instrumentation............check out the even more provocative follow up ""Wooden Foot Cops on the Highway"" if you can find it..................."
4,Classic,"This is a classic album and since it was never really a part of the mainstream, it sounds pretty timeless even today. Good Thing and So Good Today are go-to tracks for establishing a european summer picnic vibe. You can never have too much of that. Last Time is a standout track as well."
3,Could anyone be this happy?,"I liked this album when I got it back in the 80s, but they quickly earned the nickname ""HappySmiths,"" because of their obvious take on the crooning and instrumentation of that huge phenomenon of a band, although with a more positive outlook. Too positive, some would say, and I have to admit there are times when the sugar is way too concentrated. Talented musicians, but not necessarily original."
3,just OK,"First of all, this was originally released as an EP in 1986, with the five live tracks taken from the final tour with guitarist Vivian Campbell, and the studio cut ""Time to Burn"", a particularly unmemorable introduction of new guitarist Craig Goldy. Second, I have to say that the this one has one of the most no-it's-not-Spinal-Tap,-it's-serious album in heavy metal history. Third, this relatively expensive and rare CD does not appear to be a remaster.That said, it is not all bad. Namely, it has definitive versions of ""Sacred Heart"" (although the remastered live version is included on the new 'Anthology') and ""Rock and Roll Children"", complete with a medley of Rainbow tunes, ""Long Live Rock and Roll"" and ""Man on the Silver Mountain""."
3,Dio - 'Intermission' (Universal),"Originally released in 1986 as one reason this title was put out is to showcase new guitarist Craig Goldy on the cut ""Time To Burn"". An EP, with a running time of 34 minutes. A number of years ago, this would've been considered to be a full-length lp. I mean, it's nice to hear the live versions of ""King Of Rock And Roll"", ""Sacred Heart"" and ""Rock And Roll Children"", but for some reason(s), this album never did much for me. It's okay. Pretty much for the Dio completists and die-hards."
2,fair at best,"first of all the other review from ""a music fan"" is incorrectit is craig goldy on guitar and overall this cd is fair,sound quality is good but dio was coming off one of the weakest albumsof his career ""sacred heart"" with cheesy songs like ""rock n roll children"" which is pathetic compared to others in his amazing catalog of tunes.the rainbow tunes he does are played too fastand even done at the right tempo giving these songs a ""medley""treatment is a crime.i am a big fan but i like being honesti think he is without a doubt one of the greatest singers in thehistory of music but you could avoid this live ep unless you are a loyal fan (like me i have about everything from him) hope thisgives a little perspective."
1,Like pain only worse.,It's like I read this book on a dare. A friend and I were talking about the worst books we ever read. He told me he knew of a book that would make me wish I didn't know how to read. He was right. This book is one awful cliché after another until it ends in the most nonsensical climax anybody anywhere could concoct. Really. It's like he used the old Speed Racer cartoon as a science reference. Only read this book if you are a fan of junk.
5,Excellent buy,"I was having trouble with squirrels and grackles--got rid of the squirrels with a baffle but the grackles were dominating my feeders. This solved the problem, along with safflower seeds. Now i get to enjoy all the beautiful little birds and they get a chance to eat! And, the feeder is very easy to fill and well constructed. Thank you."
2,The answer is D - all of the above,"While this seems like a great, comprehensive review for the EMT-B exam, the questions are not challenging. There are many repeat questions throughout the book. Almost every question with an answer choice of ""all of the above"" is all of the above taking away the challenge of many questions. Also the book is riddled with wrong answers or answers that contradict one another. I was often left wondering whether the book might be wrong. This book would be extremely valuable for a student using the sister textbooks if their instructor uses the Brady provided exams, however, the questions do not seem like a good representation of the NREMT exam. I did like the variety in what seemed like a brief 1000 questions (few enough to cover in 1 or 2 days). Overall I would look for a different book to review for the NREMT exam."
2,Pitiful mystery but a delightful romance - 2.5 stars,"I actually enjoyed the romance in this book better then its sequel, The Valentine Wish. However, I probably would have liked the second book better had I read this one first; this first one provides much needed background to the second. Then again, this Emma seems little like the one I remember in the other. Whatever, read this one first.I liked Sarah and Chance very much, and though their romance thoroughly satisfying. The problem was with the mystery involving the missing diamonds: it was too easily solved and really didn't need Sarah's ""gifts"" at all. I solved it immediately, but it took Chance and Sarah the entire book (and Chance only after Sarah said it). Too obvious, too easy.So don't read it for the mystery, but do enjoy the romance and the intro to these three sisters who play the heroines. To be honest, I'm not looking forward to book 3, bcause I did not like Rachel in this one. We'll see."
4,sticky stuff,"i used this adhesive to apply large breast forms and was happy with the results. would recommend it for the purpose mentioned. cleanup is ofcourse sticky business, but when all that matters is your forms not coming off, this is for you. get it, h"
1,anti Euro-Americanism,"The book contains a few interesting points about the Missouri and the Yellowstone rivers. Almost all of these are collected by the author from other works. Buffalo migration patterns for instance were news to me.The rest of the book is a waste of time and paper, full of zany slams at what the author characterizes as ""euro-americans"". These are amusing for a short time, then tiresome.Buy it used or nor at all."
5,well my bf does anyway,not a big Jason fan but my bf plays it all the time...thank goodness I fall asleep before he gets into it
5,Acoustic Magnificense,"The acoustic version of ""Counting Blue Cars"" is probably one of the all-time best renditions from an original that I've ever heard. It's played to perfection and the group's musicianship is brilliantly displayed. A true ""Acoustic Magnificense""."
4,Relive the great 90's rock sound of Dishwalla,"For those who are seeking the now hard to find copy of the original Counting Blue Cars audio cd, and esp just for that one great song, this single is the album to get. All 4 tracks are wonderfully done including two versions of their smash hit ""Counting Blue Cars"". The original LP version and a brilliant acoustic display which gives a more soothing sound. For the money you can't beat this Dishwalla album single!"
3,Cassette single different,"Unlike the CD single, which has the LP version as the lead track, the cassette single lists Side A as the LP version but it is really an edit of the LP version. It just cuts some of the intro, guitar solo and ending, but retains the song's pretty melody."
3,"Good Price, but flawed design","My boat came with two of these installed in 2002. The 1st one broke after two years, and I just replaced the 2nd one which lasted ~6 years. I bought this same item again since the holes are already there in the boat, and for the price I don't mind if they only last a few years.But if you prefer to buy something once with the idea that it will last a long time this is not for you.Everytime you open the thing it fells like it is going to break. It is made of a very brittle plastic - they should use a more flexible material. And the arms that hold the can or bottle are mounted on an inside bar that is the achilles heel of the item.If you buy this just be careful using it, and maybe buy a spare because it will eventually break."
5,The Best,"""Peyton Place"" is the best written , directed and acted of all the nightime soaps (although it was called novel for television by Paul Monash , its developper).I just hope , even if it takes time that all the 514 episodes will be avalaible on DVD!"
4,one of the first and one of the best,"I can highly recommend this set, you will very soon be caught up in the trials and tribulations of this New England town. I wanted to watch the episodes one a day but that was not to be I just could not wait to see what was going to happen next. I certainly hope they continue to release the series. I have already preordered the next set. the picture quality is OK not great but it is what I expected. I did not give it five stars due to the lack of extras that we have come to expect on these sets, this set does not have any. hopefully they will include some in future releases. I would recommend this series to DARK SHADOWS fans, I think they might enjoy it also.Dark Shadows DVD Collection 1Dark Shadows The Revival - The Complete SeriesDark Shadows: The Beginning, Collection 1"
4,great show,"This is the continuing story of Peyton Place.... The ""Peyton Place"" movies was very entertaining and love those very much. Now I was wondering abou the series which I have never seen before.Sadly there are no english subtitles but well, I can live with them.They made for the Serie some changes like: Norman (in the movie and book he's gay) is now Rodney's brother but it's interesting to watching it.The episodes are not remastered / restored but in good condition. Box 2 is in the same condition.P.S: Mr. Ed Nelson and Ryan O'Neal have signed my dvd cover ;-) thanks!"
2,It gets better later,When the show debuted it was the first to be broadcast two nights in a row and became a big hit. Having seen almost the entire series I can tell those not familiar with the series that it gets much much better.First dvd set spends too much time with whining boppers but just wait until Lee Grant joins the cast as Stella Chernak and later George McCready and Ruth Warrick become cast members and the storylines get better and better. If I recall eventually the show aired three nights aweek. So my suggestion is to rent the first season and keep your hands on the fast forward clicker but season two don't. But then it has been so long since I saw it maybe that won't hold up but I bet it does.
1,This is really a gold mine,I can strongly recommend this book which I have used for years. I do a lot of preaching on Biblical characters and I have in one book conciseand accurate information at my finger tips when I need it. I used it so much the book is falling apart out and I am needing to buy a new one. For me it is a 5 out of 5.
3,series in decline,"Although I loved the first Shannara series, something of the magic has departed the more recent books. Picking up where Book I left off, Tanequil tells the stories of what has happened to the world since Griane Ohmsford's betrayal. As her enemies work to solidify their rule, her family tries to find her. Spurred by the words of the King of the Silver River, her nephew, Pen, searches for the Tanequil, a magical tree, somewhat like the Ellcrys, to craft a dark wand so he can journey into the Forbidding to rescue her, but he did not count to cost before setting out, and it is dear. Meanwhile, Griane's plight is more desperate than she can imagine. Now the prisoner of the Straken Lord, she is forced to call upon her own evil to survive, risking losing herself in the process.Though a good story, too much of it revolves around politics. Had the focus remained on the Ohmsfords, it would have been more engaging. Still, Terry Brooks is a safe bet to read."
1,Supersize paperback book?? C'mon!!,"Ok, to others, it may be known as the ""Trade Paperback.""To me, it's the paperback book that would look out of place with my regularly-sized paperback books on the shelf.Del Rey, listen up!!! I REFUSE to buy this until it comes out in a regular paperback edition! End of story! I will not settle for this monstrous volume that might feel small in some NBA player's hands.Does that mean I won't get to see how the story progresses?? OH WELL!!! I'm NOT going to compromise just so you can pocket another $5-$6 on material that cost you far less."
3,Too many plots for a less satisfying read.,"I have to agree with one of the earlier reviews, Brooks interweave multiple plot lines, creating somewhat shallow characters, something that is more frequent in the High Druid Series. I think Tanequil is better then Jarka Russ, I read it in just a week's time because the plots are building well and finally gets together, leaving readers ready for the last novel in the series. The related Triology, The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara, had enough going on in each book and just enough characters, something is not as present in this series. I still would prefer less chracters in favor of more developed characters though, and in this volume too, many main characters perish, which perversely makes it easier to keep track of the rest. I will get the next book when it comes out, but I start to wonder if this triology is the way Brooks is going to write from now on."
4,Great,"I like all of Terry's books. He take you to the land of what if, and you can lose yourself in his characters and the land they are in."
3,Poor Follow-Up,"After reading Jarka Ruus, I was excited about the story Brooks had started, but this sequel just does not live up to its predecessor. First, it was damn boring and not until half-way through did it even get exciting or interesting. Second, Grianne Ohmsford, the whole reason for the story to begin with, is nothing more than a guest star in this book. The events that happen in the Forbidding, or Jarka Ruus, are by far the most interesting points of the plot, yet Brooks spends very little time there. Maybe he waiting for the final book in this trilogy, but most of what happens in this book seemed unnecessary and just filler. These failings certainly won't stop me from reading the next book, but I wish Brooks could have done a better job."
2,ask your doctor about Tanequil...,"Tanequil. Sounds like a prescription sleep aid. Reads like a prescription sleep aid.Side effects may include dry mouth, loss of appetite, primary systemic ennui, and rickets. In clinical trials these effects were mild to moderate and comparable to placebo. If you experience blurred vision, sexual side effects, or thoughts of suicide, discontinue using Tanequil and consult a decent fantasy author immediately."
3,FAIRLY STANDARD MIDDLE VOLUME,"My title blurb pretty much covers it all. TANEQUIL continues the story of Penderrin Ohmsford in his quest to free his aunt, the vanquished High Druid of Paranor, from her prison in the Forbidding World.As the second volume in the High Durid of Shannara trilogy we would expect a couple of things; one we get the set up for the final volume and two; everything will go wrong and things will be very grim for the good guys. We get pretty much what we would expect.Since it's not the beginning and not the end of a story there isn't a whole lot to say about it. If you enjoyed JARKA RUUS and the story it started then you're going to like TANEQUIL. Same kind of action, same kind of character interactions.I liked it and certainly RECOMMEND it but you really need to read JARKA RUUS before attempting this one. I will say I am looking forward to the final installment though."
4,I good recovery--no spoilers,"I would have given the first book in this trilogy 2 1/2 stars. If fact I wasn't that thrilled about reading this new one so it took me some time to get to it. What can I say about this book? A fantastic fun read! Terry Brooks recovers well in this second, fast paced book. Demons, Trolls, Druids, Weapon of Mass destruction, magic, oh my! You name I think Terry Brooks put it in this book. I look forward to the last book in this set. I was beginning to think what some people have said about this being a tired series that needs to be put to rest were true. I think this book just gave the series a much needed jolt."
5,TanQuiel Terry Brook s,He does it agian!!!! Excellent Book to countunie The High Durid Of Shannara Series . Lots of twists and turns and once agian he leaves you hanging on the edge waiting for the next installment !!!!
4,"Adam P. Miller Place, NY",The book High Druid of Druid of Shannara: Tanequil was a very important book in this Terry Brooks trilogy. In this book there was a lot of character development and major plot twists. I enjoyed this book very much. If you read the first book you have to read this one.I liked this book so much because following the characters' thoughts and them trying to achieve their goals were very enjoyable. They are very controlling by the fact that Shadeu a'Ru uses people so well and it is very interesting. Grianne Ohmsford goes through a lot mentally and almost goes back to her old self.In conclusion I think that this book is outstanding and it is a must read book. The only bad thing that I could point out is that you really need to read the third book. I cant wait until it comes out.
3,Still waiting for the day,"Try as he might to transcend the background aesthetics of his mid-tempo programming peers, a second disc only reiterates the artist's overrated stature."
3,Misleading title,"Read carefully the book description. This is not a story of Nefertiti, but one of Mary Chubb. If you look for clues on the Amarna period and the Bible a few page are interresting."
4,"The Rifleman, Three TV Episodes","The film quality is good, as are the three stories, which hold one's attention throughout. I would recommend this DVD to anyone, especially those who enjoyed the 1950's TV program."
1,The Rifle man The T.V. Episodes,I purchased this item from House On Fire they sent the wrong item it only had two episodes on the D.V.D. they advertised three. HORRIBLE AND VERY RUDE THIRD PARTY.
4,Converse Team Discovery Cheerleading Shoes,"I really like the shoes, but they did not come with the different colors so we could change the colors of the stars. This was suppose to be included, but was not. Other than that, I was really excited to find this shoe because it has been discontinued and I had a really hard time finding it."
3,It may sand good but replacement is the key!,"It's funny, the sander works great! But my pad had to be replaced because it kept tossing the disc off the pad! Why is it that it is made to keep the sandpaper on and after using it for awhile it wears out? The pad is listed here at 17+ dallors......in the stores around here, they cost more! I'd rather find a product that does just as well and not be replacing a part that cost alot of money!"
5,Great alternative,"This is an alternative to buying a new sander. If the sanding discs keep falling off, this will solve the problem and is much cheaper than a new sander. Switching out the old pad with the new one is very easy and takes 5 minutes or less."
5,Perfect Match,I bought these as replacements for the used pad that had become worn and unable to hold a disc any more. Fits perfectly and operates like new. The pricing was great and I would certainly purchase again.
1,"Good sander ,Poor pad","this is the third sanding pad I have had to replace.Where the three screws hold this pad, it is so flimsy I think I could just about bite it into. As far as the sander goes it is the best one I have ever had, but I am thinking seriously of looking for another sander, rather than buy a pad every 3 months. They do make a pad {pta39} that seems to be made to last as long as the hook and loops will, but it will not fit the 333 sander. I wonder if we all emailed the manufacturer and let them know how we feel if it would make a difference. I think I will do just that before I go off line[...]"
5,Renew your sander,A new pad makes the sander hold sanding disks the same way it did when it was new.
5,Orbital sander replacement pad,Factory pad for the Porter-Cable 333 sander is good quality and easy to replace.Reasonable price on Amazon.
3,"Good pad, bad wear","These pads are great when first installed, however they do not last a long time. The begin to have less grip after a dozen or so sheets. They will start coming loose at the edges and eventually not hold the paper any longer. I am planning to switch to self adhesive paper after I exhaust my current supply of hook and loop. That will be several more pads though, a pricey proposition."
3,Haven't Used Yet,Was glad to be able to find the pad and to not have to buy a whole new sander. Have not used it yet but fits onto my sander.
3,There is no balm in bombs.,"There are numerous precedents that can legitimately contribute to standardizing a certain pronunciation: precedent, current usage, spelling, analogy to other usages, etc. Elster usues whichever ones are convenient to validate his own prejudices. ""Flaccid"" should be ""flack-sid"" bacause the dictionary says so, but ""hospitable"" should be ""ho-SPIT-able"" because everyone says it that way.Why should I take pronunciation lessons from a man who pronounces ""balm"" and ""bomb"" the same way?"
4,Sweet!,"Lots of pictures, lots of info. Think you know a lot about NASCAR history? Read this and find out for sure."
5,More than just another Celtic harp album,"I own a fair number of Celtic harp albums and have listened to more, including Patrick Ball's four previous albums. While almost all of it has been pleasant, this one is a real standout. Where many albums offer still more versions of over-familiar melodies, this one is striking in its originality. Where some performances give the impression of tinkling music boxes or technical expertise that is somehow boring, this one is riveting and evocative. Some purists may find it insufficiently traditional, but I found it beautifully imaginative. Unlike reviewers who preferred this musician's earlier albums, to me this is the most interesting and moving of them all. ""Fiona"" came out in 1993; I am hoping that Mr. Ball is near to producing another album. Given the progression through his earlier work, I can hardly wait to see what he does next."
5,The Best Celtic Harp CD I've every Heard,"It was really easy for me to fall in love with this CD because , for instance we share a birthyear(1993) and a name(Fiona). But besides just that, this music, for all that it's just an instrumental CD it has so much emotion in it and the songs we're so well arranged by Patrick Ball, Kevin Carr and Tim Britton that it's really easy to just get lost in. It's also some of the most relaxing music I've ever heard, but that might just be because it's always been my lullaby music...But, if you're a fan of Celtic music, or even if your not, you can't deny the beauty of the music in this CD, so I suggest that you buy it, you won't regret it!"
1,Huh? Yikes!,"I have not finished this book yet but so far I think this woman is a nut. Referring to grocery store shelves as morgues for ""dead"" food. That's just stupid and weird. No cooked food? None? Forget it, lady.She has some good ideas but they are taken to the extreme."
5,Fantastic book.,"This book is exceptional. It is highly informative and inspiring. She's brutally honest about true beauty and how not having it can affect every area of your life negatively.I've started to follow the authors advice and amazed by the changes in my body. This is a must-read. If you want to LOSE WEIGHT you won't find any gimmicks here, just sound nutritional advice.If you are a meat-eater and want to transition into vegetariansim and then veganism before become a few foodist, I recommend starting with Dr. Ornish's Eat More, Weigh Less. However, I wish I had found Tonya's book first and had the inclination to be a raw foodist sooner because it's SO much healthier for you. For information on juicing, I recommend Jay Kordich's book (which she also mentions in Your Right To Be Beautiful)."
5,You are doing a Miracle on me,"Dear Tonya,All my life I have been looking for a change. I have prayed all my life to received help. I am now 52 years old. Like you I was so low in confidence and I was brainwashed as if this was supposed to be like this for ever. But now: Your right to be Beautiful is opening my eyes and opening my hope incredibly. You are beautiful Tonya.....You are changing my life.....You are doing a Miracle on me. And in your book, you are the ""Proof"" that it is possible. I am so happy, I now explose of passion to act as you are. I will never thank you enough. I am so grateful."
3,psychology of art,This author has a good knowledge of his subject. His earlier book is wonderful with insight. This book is a revamp of that material with a summary of some recent research. For my needs the first book is more to my taste.
4,The Birth Of Bill Murray....A perfect performance,"This film doesn't get the coverage it deserves because it deals with Drugs and other behavior without judgement, and that's not correct these days BUT This is where the best of Bill Murray was born, and seen at it's cleanest and best....."
1,no soundtrack,"I purchased this as a gift for a friend. I purchased it mainly for the soundtrack, but there was no soundtrack on it. It is not worth the trouble to return. Buyer beware"
5,better than fear and loathing..............,"this movie made me laugh so damn hard, i was in tears half the time. bill murray did a way better job playing hunter than johnny depp did. fear and loathing is still a good movie, but this one goes way more into detail of how much drugs were really used on hunter and his crazy gonzo lawyers adventures. as your lawyer i advise you to watch this movie, and maybe toke a few too."
1,UNIVERSAL TRASH!,It is becoming harder to sympathize with hollywood studios over video bootlegging. This film is a cult classic and now the only way to get an authentic copy is to make a VHS to DVD transfer. Typical of universal...Shame on you.
3,Where the Buffalo Roam,"If you are a fan of the late, great gonzo writer Hunter S. Thompson, this is a must see. While wildly uneven in Bill Murray's portrayal of HST, and an equally frustrating script, it is much more enjoyable as a movie than the recently released Johnny Depp tour de force portrayal in ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"", which is often painful to watch, but probably a more accurate representation of the great gonzo himself. The best scenes revolve around his frustrated editor fevorishly seeking copy, while Peter Boyle literally steals the movie as HST's alter ego, Lazlo. A classic scene is with R.M. Nixon in a bathroom. A fun introduction to a truly strange and compelling individual. My best suggestion is to purchase a copy of the documentary ""Buy the Ticket, Take the Ride"", read his first books on the Hells Angels, the Super Bowl, Las Vegas, and his best work, ""The Great Shark Hunt"". Go Gonzo!"
1,Bogus,Maybe its just because the Fear and Loathing movie came out i dont know .I found this movie boring and pointless. I was told to get it but now I regret it.
2,"4-stars for Murray, as for the rest well...","Bill Murray plays Hunter S. Thompson perfectly (with perhaps more hair than was actually necessary!) in this awkward 1980 film, based loosely on some of Thompson's works from ""The Great Shark Hunt"" (1979). While Thompson fans may appreciate this one for it's cynical humour and dry wit, the film goes basically nowhere, and leaves the viewer wondering what in the hell is the point to all of this! Peter Boyle's performance (especially in comparison to Bencio DelToro's) as HST's Samoian attorney, Oscar DeAcosta, is awful!! Overall, the movie is worth at least one viewing, for Murray's A-calibre performance, but other than that the flick is an unfortunate celluloid waste. Try ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" (1998) directed by Terry Gilliam. Johnny Deep, as HST, pales in comparison to Murray as Thompson, but the film is 110% better. Good luck and happy ""Hunting."""
1,Don't be fooled,"Don't be fooled by some of the other reviews listed above. I saw a lot of five star and four star reviews here, but let me tell you the truth so that you don't make the mistake I just did: this movie is a stinker. And that's being very generous. This movie had a few funny scenes--and I'm talking a FEW--but, as a whole, it was absolutely dreadful. It's two hours of your life that you'll never get back. Save your time and your money and steer clear of this ...."
5,Classic,"Whether your a fan of Mr. Bill Murray or Hunter S. Thompson, this is a definite must have for any movie enthusist. Good laughs, excellent acting, and of course good writing seeing as how Mr. Thompson aided in the story. I knew I recognized Lazlo(Hunter's crazed lawyer) who is played by Peter Boyle and it was very interesting to see the man when he still had hair(well....) and smarting off to others besides the Romano clan. You must have this placed next to Fear and Loathing if you don't already. Don't be a part of the underestimators, ADD THIS!!"
3,dootle loot doot doot doo,"This movie is all about Bill Murray's impressive performance as Hunter S. Thompson. If there's anyone out there who isn't an HST fan yet liked this movie, I'd be curious to hear their perspective. Aside from the usual criticisms of this movie, the biggest offender is the cringe-inducing portrayal of Oscar Zeta Ocosta, Hunter's infamous attorney. At any rate, this is worth being in my collection."
1,Do Not Buy Universal Studios UPC 096895507533,"Took the advice of warning not to buy the DVD version & STILL ended up with a rescored soundtrack. Painful to watch despite being one of the funniest movies out there. I curse the greedy souless schmuck behind this artistic desecration. The box even ""boasts a record score...hit-crammed soundtrack."" Hey, you heartless bastard, may you wake up in a pile of rabid weasels to an endless tape-loop of ""You light up my Life!"""
1,Too ... For Music Rights,"The movie, of course, is quite funny... in it's original form. I've seen it many times, and own it on VHS. Imagine, if you can, the bizarre and jarring effect of replacing all of the great sixties music (Highway 61, Purple Haze, etc.) with awful sounding 80's era fake rock. The description says it has all of this great music, but, obviously, Artisan was too ... to buy the rights to the music. Better off looking for an original VHS copy.Very funny, though, and infinately more light-hearted than Terry Gilliam's ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas""... a movie that somehow did the unimaginable - made riding around in cars with a head full of acid seem like something you wouldn't want to do!"
1,Bill Murray as Bill Murray,"The best scene in this tedious production occurs during the first five minutes when Murray's Doberman attacks a Richard Nixon dummy, firmly sinking its teeth into the Trickster's crotch. After that, it's all downhill.A good film depicting Hunter Thompson has yet to be produced. Perhaps it's impossible to do, but Murray's slapstick approach does a disservice to Thompson's dry wit."
2,Not that it matters,"Not that this necessarily matters to most people, but, if you're a diehard fan of Hunter S. then you may be interested: I read an interview with Thompson in which he condemned this movie. He said it in no way emulated his life and that Murray did a hack job, going for humor as opposed to accuracy. So, in my opinion, if you want to learn more about Thompson you should watch Gilliam's Fear and Loathing, starring Johnny Depp. Depp lived with Thompson for 6 months prior to shooting, so I'd say he did his research.One more thing, Thompson is known for lying in interviews, so maybe everything I've said is worthless."
1,This is an awful movie.,I am a fan of both Murray and Thompson and this mess squanders the talent of Murray and the inspiration of Thompson. Please take my advice and do not attempt to sit through this. It is that bad.
3,"Good movie, but why?","I have been a Thompson fan for years. The first time I saw this movie I was impressed. I owned a copy of the Anchor Bay VHS anxiously waiting for a DVD release. I bought a copy of the Anchor Bay DVD as soon as I knew it existed. Later this DVD was released and I bought a copy in hopes of some bonus material - anything. I was sorely disappointed. I was hoping for more from the original studio. I can only hope for a future release for ANY sort of bonus features. I ended up selling this version, and keeping my original Anchor Bay version. I know that it has non-original music, but it is the version I know."
4,Different,This movie was recommended to me by a person who likes Hunter Thompson. Johnny Depp's friend was Hunter and this movie showed some one else protraying Hunter.
1,Truly stinks,"Having found nothing the slightest bit amusing in the first half hour, I had to hit eject on this one. Dated '70s druggy humor hasn't worn well, I guess. At least for me. This has the mark of a dud written all over it."
5,The best newspaper of the Korean American community,"Korean Quarterly is the nation's only newspaper of the Korean American community, published in English, which represents the diversity of the Korean American community, including first and second generation Korean Americans, adopted Koreans and their families, and other families with Korean American connections. Korean Quarterly celebrates the diversity of Korean Americans, and includes feature coverage, news analysis, opinion, literature and film, poetry and creative writing, Korean food, and politics between Korean and the U.S. and the two Koreas.Korean Quarterly is an independent non-profit, volunteer publication, and all contributions are tax-deductible. It has been recognized more than 25 times for its journalistic excellence, and its leadership has been recognized for contributions to the local and national Korean American community."
5,Great bedding,"I really like this bedding. However, I underestimated how much I would need for my snake's tank and had to use one whole bag. I was hoping to spread it out between two uses.. Oh well. Still a great bedding. My Ball Python seems to like it and it's not too sharp."
5,a unique biography of professional athlete-humanitarian,"an inspiring account of The Tall Mexican, Hank Aguirre, who was a true professional baseball star; but who dedicated his post-celebrity life to helping his fellow Hispanics in Detroit by starting a business and providing jobs for the unemployable. He started his business in 1979 with eight employees and one run-down former bump-shop in the Mexicantown barrio. Today, there are eight locations emoloying over 1500 workers - 87% of whom are Hispanic. Sales this year are projected at $156 million. Hank succumbed to prostate cancer in 1994, but his legacy prevails."
5,Totally Awesome,"I am totally in love with dancing Merengue, and this CD always gets me going. I'd say 10 out of 12 songs make me get up and dance. I literally cannot sit down when they come on. After returning from a trip in Costa Rica I got addicted to the music and dancing to it. If you have any idea how I feel, then you will really like this CD. It is a totally awesome CD, and if you're interested in learning Merengue or just enjoying the music, this CD is perfect for you."
5,Best on the album,"This single was the one that Britney decided to release rather than 'Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman' outside of the USA. Undoubtedly this is the best on the album and a good follow-up to her much-acclaimed yet surprising single 'Slave 4U'. Whereas 'Slave' was definitely a new direction for Britney stylistically, this is back to her usual pop and should serve fans of her more traditional music well. Saying that, it's still got that 'edge' to it that all of her singles seem to have. This again goes to prove that Britney can add to her winning formula whilst still retaining her pop roots.The remixes included here aren't too interesting, but the single itself is just fantastic."
3,"Overprotected Remix Bites, But Slave Remix A Must Have","Though here in the US, Britney has released ""I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman"" as her second single from the ""Britney"" album, overseas, ""Overprotected"" is the second single. Hopefully, we'll see remixes of ""Not A Girl"" eventually. Unfortunately, this import single has only one remix of ""Overprotected"" and a dub of the remix. Done by JS16, it's got a trancey feel, but only uses a little bit of the original's lyrics. But, the single is a must have for the Thunderpuss remix of ""I'm A Slave 4 U"" which was only available on vinyl until now. It is a radio edit version, but is still groovelicious. Thunderpuss speeds up the song, but still manages to maintain it's sexy vibe. A must have for all you Britney fans."
3,Overprotected Import CD,"I really like this CD. It's a very good song and it's my favorite off the new Britney Album. The first track on the single is the album version of Overprotected, which is great! Tracks 2 and 3 are pretty much the same remix of Overprotected, which are ok! The remixes basically just repreat the word ""Overprotected"" over and over, and that's about it. The britney interview is pretty good and it is interesting. Track 5 is the album version of ""I'm a slave 4 u"" which is great. Track 6 is the thunderpuss remix of Slave 4 u which is great. I love this remix. Over all, the cd is ok and if your a huge Brit fan, it's a most have with exclusive remixes and the bonus interview."
2,Why Did They Edit the Thunderpuss Remix?,"First of all, skip the track ""Overprotected."" It's a whiny, self-absorbed declaration of independence written by Swede Max Martin. Instead, go directly to the Thunderpuss remix of ""I'm a Slave for You."" This track, originally produced by the Neptunes, gets a highly energetic treatment from Chris Cox and Barry Harris. Unfortunately, I still can't totally recommend this CD on the strength of the Thunderpuss remix, for it is only the edited version. I would have eliminated the boring ""interview"" and instead made room for the full-length remix. Britney fans will lap this up, but casual listeners should make a U-turn and avoid."
1,Should Have Been Better,"Britney could have put in a little more effort in this single. OVERPROTECTED is a great song, but the JS16 Remix & Dub are sort of annoying - plus she doesnt really sing at all in them & it has all these cranium cracking rhythms going on at the same time that just make you get a bad headache, i mean bad. The interview is a waste of CD space, i hate it when she talks because she is sort of boring to listen to. I'M A SLAVE 4 U is the song i like the least, when she pops a bad word + the drum beats in there are disgusting. But the Thunderpuss Radio Mix is pretty good, i can make an exception on that one. And the Enhanced CD Section has the trailer of ""Crossroads"" with her singing a performance of Overprotected during all the outtakes are showing. Sort of a boring Trailer/Music Video. Don't waste your money on this one. If you want more of her buy her album BRITNEY which is what you call SO much better."
3,poor service,"I received this 50 pound floor fan in May. Lat month the oscillating function stopped working properlyI called the company as this is still under warranty and was told they have no repair service in manhattan and they would provide a place in Brooklyn to take the fan in for repair. I explained that I have no car and could not lift this fan anyway as it weighs 50 pounds!! I left two messages for a supervisor. No one has returned my calls.This company did not try to be helpful . If you purchase from them, make sure there is a ""service"" provider near youut and repair a large fan or you will be out $299.I will be contacting the better business bureau and filing a complaint"
2,Ineffective,"There may be some place in the care of cats that these gloves are useful, but they certainly were ineffective in removing loose hair on my cats. The bumps are very small and really don't do much of anything. I am able to remove more loose hair with my hand while petting a cat than I could get these gloves to do."
3,It worked ok,"I would recommend these gloves if you have a tight budget and can't afford anything else. The actual gloves work, but they are hard to clean. My cats loved it, but it created static sometimes which startled them."
3,Not really,it works a little. I have a shedding cat and this doesnt really help getting as much hair as I need off.
1,Good idea,The idea behind these gloves is great but they don't grab the hairs and are too smooth to be more effective than a naked hand. These are great for cats that don't like combs or brushes...but the design has to be improved.
3,OK Product,"Cat did not mind being petted with this. Did not remove as much hair as brushing does but does remove loose hair on the surface. Cat enjoyed the roughness in her favorite spot under the chin. Also the glove is a lot heavier weight than i thought it would have been, thus it was hotter than I thought. I say it is average in rating, cat seemed to enjoy, removed some hair. Good price to try, it might work better with shorter hair cats."
4,They work fine,"Haven't had any real problems with these but they have average performance. Not bad for price, though!"
1,"poor quality, didn't work at all","I wasn't expecting much of these when I ordered them (they were just a filler for an order) but they still managed to disappoint. They didn't really pick up any fur from my cats (one is short-haired and one is a Main Coon), but what really got me is that I put them on my side table, and they melted into the finish. One glove was on the table and the other was on a book (also on the table), and both the book and the table now have permanent little marks all over them where the dots were. They were not in a warm room or anything, so there is no excuse for why this happened. My side table will never be the same again, since it appears the gloves reacted with the finish or something (and I've had this table for 7+ years, no problems...)"
3,Works ok for the money,"Don't expect to be wow'd, but it does pick up some loose fur. If your cat likes to be be petted, he'll love it. Doesn't seem to oversensitize or irritate them like some grooming products - so less likely you'll get a ""hey, stop!"" nip if your cat is so inclined.This is a regular grooming product, not a once a month deal - it doesn't deal that well with grabbing large quantities of fur.But solid enough and reliable."
2,Same as the other gloves offered on Amazon,"I bought this pair of gloves and another set similar to it that Amazon offered, both types turned out to be very disappointing. In fact, they are quite useless as far as I'm concerned.I'm not sure what they were designed to work on, but if you have a long-haired cat, save your money."
3,Grooming Glove,"The glove worked OK, but we have a brush that works much better, sorry I don't know the brand name.Also, the glove is rather difficult to clean off."
2,Not So Simple Solution,"I bought this as a way to pet my cats without them knowing they were being brushed. They get nervous when I actually brush them. These gloves are basically the same ones that come with spare tire kits on SUVs. They are made for grip, not grooming cats. My cats don't mind being pet while I have the gloves on, but they don't do anything for their fur. I can pet them for several minutes and the gloves have no old dry fur in them, and thats the reason I brush them. I would have given the gloves a one star, but they are actually good for opening tough jars."
1,Waste of time and money,"Absolutely worthless. Barely picked up any hair. And the gloves are too small for me, very difficult to get on."
2,simply not good,My cat hates when i use these gloves and it didn't work at all. Save your money and invest in different pair. I think it was the type of rubber they used which didn't collect any hair.
2,grooming gloves,These seem like a good idea. and they would be if the little rubber nubs were a bit sticky. my cats have really long hair so maybe it would work better on short hair
1,blinded by this snowblind,"This is the same movie as ""ski lift to death"" - which i discovered while searching for it. It's still the great 70's -type drama, but in this edition, the quality of the film is horrific - truly blinding! Nearly unbearable to watch. Also, during a dance contest sequence, someone tried to insert newer, hipper music into the film, which made for people not dancing to the music, and any dialog during the segment overlaid with two different tracks of music. What a nightmare!! If i could ever find a good copy, that hadn't been altered, i'd love to enjoy it again! Was this a pirated copy off someones old VCR then sound edited and dubbed onto DVD? Probably!!!"
5,The man wit da Gift Of Gab,"Holy S**t! I didn't think Blackalicious would even make the step towards this kind of music. This album expands your mind. If you are still falling for all that fraudulence in hip-hop today, beware of Nia. Soulful and complex tracks which get better (make more sense) the more you listen. Check this out, all real hip-hop people, you know who you are. peace"
3,Chief Xcel is so underrated.,"Gift of Gab without a doubt is one of the most original, underrated, and dope emcees of our time. And along with amazing production at the hands of Chief Xcel- Blackalicious always brigs something interesting to listen to. NIA is a fantastic album from beginning to end but its one of those you need to be in a certain mood for. Personally, Gift of Gab is one of those artists who you dont heavily rotate but when you do play ears are definitely satisfied without complaints...Just has to be that certain 'mood' for the album and artists to fully sink in.Excellent album. Need to catch up on the other Blackalicious albums to compare. Definitely worth a purchase and a listen!"
3,"Nice, but not a classic","This album really grew on me. Blackalicious' stuff doesn't sound like anyone else, so you might need a few listens to really get into their groove. The Gift of Gab really shows great range of lyrical styles, sometimes switching between styles during a track (like on ""Do This My Way""). People who are really familiar with the ""A2G"" EP may feel cheated by this LP, because several tracks from the EP are on here. They're great tracks, but they've been out for a few years. Most of this is excellen hip-hop, but a few weak tracks dispersed throughout the album really break up the flow. ""You Didn't Know That Though"" sounds like euro-trash club music, and ""Ego Trip"" is just a woman reading a Nikki Giovanni poem. The album is worth buying for great songs like ""Do This My Way"" or ""Reanimation,"" but the album as a whole falls far short of a coherent masterpiece in my mind. There are plenty of new sounds here, but be warned, not all of them are good."
1,hmm,"Well, i dont want to ramble on, I'll keep this short and sweet. I dont know what the big deal is about this album. Most of the songs (minus a couple), I found boring and nearly put me to sleep. How could this be the 2nd best hip-hop/rap album of 2000? I disagree."
5,Flawless Execution,"Nia is a flawless example of a great hip-hop album. Much like Outkast, though entirely different, Blackalicious deliver a carefully balanced combination of wit, intelligence and emotion into both the music, lyrics, chorus, album artwork. Everything about Nia screams great music. Too many songs to name, but one careful listen will explain that both Chief Xcel and the Gift of Gab have a clear understanding of musical and lyrical composition, not to mention a healthy respect for continuing a legacy in Black music."

5,This book IS a jewel!,Amazing. I spent outside my budget to get this book and it's worth every cent.
4,"Good, but not my favorite Harney Sons tea","I was expecting it to be really fruity, it wasn't bad, just not memorable like most Harney Sons teas are for me.My favorites are the Hot Cinammon Spice and Chamomile by Harney & Sons."
5,WONDERFUL! aTLANTA Constitution,"In their heyday in the 1940s and '50s, the Catskills, in New York's Sullivan and Ulster counties, were less a place than a state of mind, according to the Frommers. In their wonderful collection of reminiscences by those who worked and played the mountains, anyone who ever vacationed there will find something between nostalgia and heartburn - or, perhaps, just hunger for borscht, the red-beet soup that became a staple at the region's most famous resort, Grossinger's."
4,"BRAVO! Pamela Gray/ Screenwriter of ""A Walk on the Moon""","I used [Myrna and Harvey Frommer's] ""It Happened in the Catskills."" I used that a lot just to look at photographs. All the actors had to read ""It Happened in the Catskills"" - and of course the production designer relied on those things very heavily"
1,You can grind out a better one yourself,Its made in China and you can see the misery in the workmanship.Big gashes in the peen that they tried to hide with a black coating. Just get a double face hammer in weight of choice and round the edges of one side and grind down a peen on the other making sure to round those edges.Its branded with Master Mechanic so you know to avoid anything that comes out of there pisspot.
2,RJD hits bottom,"Not sure what happened here. Strange Highways was a predictably heavier Dio following the brief Dio-era Sabbath reunion and really rocked. This album tried to go heavier and darker, and frankly is a mess, really killing any new momentum Strange Highways may have created for Dio Few memorable riffs, few memorable memories, simply dark, muffled, ploddy, and confused. Vinny's drums are more complex, but really struggle to fit Tracy G's guitar lines, leaving an off-tempo feel on a lot of songs. In addition, the production does the songs no favors either. This isn't the worst album by any means, but it is Dio's worst in my opinion."
1,Complete Letdown,"I loved Dehumanizer and after Ozzy rejoined I fell out of love with Black Sabbath. I took a chance on Dio's Strange Highways after reading an Amazon review that compared it to Dehumaizer. While not as amazing as that album, Strange Highways was a solid, heavy album. I read an Amazon review of Angry Machines that called even heavier and darker. I took a chance and I was totally let down. This album is a waste. No interesting riffs ( I can't believe this is the same guitarist that played on Strange Highways!) and empty lyrics. Save your money or pick up Dehumanizer if you haven't already."
2,Not sooooo bad !!,"This is not a bad CD, but if you`ve just heard Holy Diver and The Last in Line(the two first Dio`s Cds) you will not like it."
2,HOPE HIS FUTURE WORK MAKES UP FOR THIS,"THOUGH I AM STILL AS FAITHFUL TO RONNIE AND HIS WORK AS EVER, THIS IS BY FAR HIS LEAST IMPRESSIVE WORK. ""HUNTER OF THE HEART"" IS A GOOD ENOUGH SONG, AND ""THIS IS YOUR LIFE"" PROVES HIS VOICE IS AS PERFECT AS EVER, BUT THE PRODUCT ENTIRE IS SEVERELY LACKING. SORRY, RONNIE. I'M STILL WITH YA."
3,Dio Starting To Get His Sight Back,"Sticking with Tracy G is Dio's biggest setback on this album. Without a doubt, Dio's worst guitar player, Tracy G should be shot or forced to take a few million lessons. His riffs are all slightly out of tune which is way f*cking annoying, that is why this album is so unmemorable, because there are no hooks. Ronnie Dio moves away from his Swords & Sorcery bread and butter and tries to tackle real-world issues with these songs, but the key elements are still missing. This album sounds very ponderous and heavy, like being beaten with a pillowcase filled with door-knobs. Not very melodic, soundz like Dio after a bad drunk. Once Tracy G is outta the way, Dio will start to pick up the pieces of his career and see the light once again....and we can't wait. The Japanese version does contain the hidden gem ""God Hates Heavy Metal"" which is worth hearing after all this dreary bile."
2,Another Snoozer,"Plodding, uninspiring and hard to get into album. Has a few songs that are worth listening to but it is a pain. Listen to his older stuff -- it rocks."
5,Angry Machines Rocks!,"I just need to chime in and say that Angry Machines is a great album. Sure the production seems different than classic earlier albums, but the songs are simple and awsome. Black, Double Monday, and Dying in America are personal favorites. You never hear about this album when Dio comes up, but I believe those who turn over this stone will be one step closer rock n' roll fulfillment."
4,dio album angry machines,this is a good album and a classic dio sound and mix of rock and metal a true album for any dio fan
2,Dio goes for the harder edge,"In an ill-advised effort to possibly appease fans of low-rumbling hard rock that was ever present in the mid-90s, Ronnie and co. temporarily freak out and try to go Pantera or something. No, not really Pantera, but definitely something. Angry Machines ultimately succeeds at sending mixed and confusing signals. Gone are the band's trademark choruses and catchy melodies. They are replaced by clunky song structures, sometimes interwoven with industrual (via-Nine Inch Nails) interludes such as on ""Stay Out of My Mind."" Hey, I'm all for change, and understand it's foolish for a band to stay with the same sound forever, but really, Dio are out of their element trying for material such as this. Not only that, but Ronnie's wide vocal vibrato really doesn't mesh with the new found style all that well...Anyway, I can crack an academic smile while listening to about a third of this, on the other two thirds it's more like a twisted smirk."
4,Best of them all,"I'll admit that this is the best 1/2 sheet sander on the market and has been for 30 plus years. Simple to use, vibration free, reliable as the day is long and a high quality finish are all part of what you are buying with this model.So why have I given it a 4 star rating? Two words, dust collection... or lack thereof. For as long as this model has been on the market PC have still not given any serious consideration to how to effectively collect the considerable amount of dust generated by this tool. There is a boot PC sells as an add-on that fits over the base. However, unless your only sanding flat surfaces AND are willing to drag a vacuum hose around you can rule this accessory out. Something, anything would help especially with so much dust control regulations being imposed by various government agencies, work place safety boards, fire marshals and insurance companies.Other than that a great tool that will basically last forever. Highly recommended."
2,False advertising...,"This sander, like most of Porter-Cable's tools, is no longer made in USA. Although the technical information indicates this tool is made here, it is actually made in Mexico!! Unfortunately, the management of Porter-Cable has decided to discard their image as one of the last tool companies producing high-end American made tools in favor of cheap imports."
3,"Works great, could be higher rated with a little more","This dehumidifier works great in the basement.The first one I bought had a defective water level assembly. The way the water level shutoff is designed seems Mickey-mouse. I returned the unit and the replacement has been working fine for 2 years, but I still don't like the way the water level shutoff works but it's been fine.This unit doesn't have a filter. I'm not sure how much a filter would actually do, but like the filters in window air conditioners one would filter debris from getting stuck in the condenser.Overall, the unit has worked fine and done what it was supposed to. I got a second dehumidifier for a different part of the house and it is a Maytag that cost the same amount but has a filter and a better designed water level assembly and a better designed water bucket. Essentially the way you carry the bucket and pour it out is more user friendly.Overall, it ok but if I need a replacement I'd get the Maytag."
2,Well... OK,"This is not a bad camera, so please don't be mislead by my review. For anyone who wants a [inexpensive] camera that works, nothing beyond that, this could be the camera for you. If you plan on taking the camera everywhere, this is fine. If you want to be a serious photographer, however, don't even consider this one. Liek I said, it will take pictures just fine, it isn't a single-use camera, and it doesn't touch anything else beyond that. I hope this product review has been helpful to you."

5,fantastic book,This is may be an older book but it is one of the finest pieces of lesbian fiction I have ever read. I recommend this book to everyone.
1,Bargan Basement Divine,"The operative word here is ""cheap."" This CD is from a video recording of two of Divine's performances at a nightclub in Manchester, England from 1983.What we have hear is the audio track from the live video footage. A muffled, monophonic recording of Divine basically singing along to her own songs being played over the club's PA system. In between songs, she talks dirty to the audience, and even answers the occasional audeince question.She sounds bored, as if she'd rather be anywhere else. She doesn't seem to be enjoying herself very much. She also sounds as if she's stuck in the middle of a tour, and she's grown tired of doing the same act night after night after night...The cheapness of this production is painfully apparent by the misspelling of her song ""The Name Game"" on the cover as ""Gang Bang,"" not once, but twice(!) This CD is only of interest as a documentary oddity, but it's definitely not for your listening pleasure..."
3,Born to be Divine,"This CD is actually a compilation of two live performances in Manchester back in 1983. Divine is basically singing over his pre-recorded songs. The audio quality is not the greatest, but it is still fun to listen to Divine's interaction with the audience."
2,The whole ting is a waste,"These pads - and the electric fruit fly unit - was practicly ineffective. With a SWARM of FF 12 inches away, it had lured and traped maybe twenty."
4,Pesky flies were caught indeed...,"First of all, it is bigger than it seems from the picture - about 12'' long (I know, I know, that's what she said).We put in in the kitchen, where we had pesky fruit flies for a while. The device is intended to work in a dark place with no other light sources to ""distract"" the bugs, so we plugged it in at night. The first few nights we got a pretty good catch, including a moth. Things have leveled off since, I don't know whether because we have less flies, or because the sticky pad filled up. Or maybe the little buggers figured it out.An unexpected plus - it doubles as a night light, so we don't trip over the dog anymore trying to get to a crying baby in the middle of the night... (-:"
3,Well they ARE sticky!!,Still waiting for our Fly Web trap to actually catch a fly. Time will tell. These glue boards do fit into the unit nicely and they are very sticky. I am sure if a fly actually lands on one it will stay there!!
4,Works Great,"Good for knats and small bugs,by the third day I had to replace the ""sticky card"".A little pricey but well worth it in the long run."
5,Works great easy to order,"This fly trap works great in our home! Traps fruit flies, mosquitos, moths and more. We use it year round since we're in a rural setting!"
1,Misleading product title,"I share the disappointment of the reviewer who did not realize that the glue board item was for replacement only of an expensive indoor lighting product. Will try to return but difficult for me. Should have read every product detail and marketing approach, not just average number of stars. AmazonFlyweb Fly Light Glue Boards (10 pack)should point out initially that this is a replacement/refill item for an INDOOR, ELECTRIC LIGHT, EXPENSIVE PRODUCT. I am also confused by different prices quoted depending on pictures and how one searches."
3,I don't know what it is...,"I got this on a whim because my new puppy brought flies into my apartment. It was cheap and I decided to give it a try. Well, I don't know what it is and trashed it right after opening the package, but I am still giving it 3 stars because it might just be me being stupid and it works for others."
1,Be very careful,"I was not careful. I saw that this had fine customer reviews, read a couple and ordered them. It was only after they came that I found out that they were useless unless I ordered a $29 item. Then when I read up on the $29 item I found that it would not be suitable for my use. OK--I will return this but I wish that the ad would be very clear so other careless people like me do not go through this routine."
5,"Catch no ""seeums""",We live in Florida... product is perfect for catching small [very small] insects that can get thru a micro screen!!!AZ
1,Not a good choice - a waste of money.,"Ms. Looseleaf has managed to interject 4-letter words into the stories which, in my opinion, is totally not necessary. Another bad example being conveyed to our impressionable young. No wonder children are killing children. Some adults need an attitude adjustment and lessons taught in how to effectively influence children. I'm a mother, I would not give this to my daughter. In fact, even the pictures are lame."
4,"The Best of the ""Quikie Biographies""",This one has some exclusive pics and stories that only a personal friend of the man could know. It is the best of the series of Quickie Leo Biographies thus far. I would recommend this for any true Leo fan.
5,After reading this book I feel like I really do know Leo!,"Everything about this book is excellent. It is the most popular book on my coffee table, especially with young teenagers. Looseleaf's myraid selection of private photos tell their own story of life with Leo. Overall this is the most comprehensive book about Leonardo that you will find. I gave five of the books as gifts this past holiday."
1,I guess I'm a liar...,"I'd like to personally thank Timothy Gower (the author) for writing in a children's book: ""In some families, parents enjoy lying to their young children about a ""tooth fairy"" that comes..."". The Tooth Fairy doesn't exist in our home as a way to ""comfort"" kids about losing teeth. It's an innocent belief that every child should have the opportunity to enjoy just like Santa Claus. I appreciate him (a) calling me a liar and (b) destroying my daughter's belief in something so innocent as the Tooth Fairy.I hope that Timothy has kids and someone takes something away from them just like he took the Tooth Fairy away from my daughter!PS - I'd give this zero stars if Amazon would let me!"
5,the fight rock,The fight are amazin i seen them when they toured with rancid at the Glasgow barrowlands on 25/09/03 and they put on one hell of a show so i recommend u to go see them when they tour again and to get there album u wont be dissapointed that i can promisse
1,terrible,"this ep is terrible and weak, the lyrics are amoung some of the worst i have heard and they are just too late with this punk thing, its been done now over n over again. i am a big punk fan rancid, new found glory, green day, pistols, but not this please not the fight, they are just acting like there idols.,"
4,The Best Cleopatra LAG CD to date,"This is as good as any of those Japanese releases of the mid 90's (Live Vampires etc), P. Lewis's voice proves that he still has it on most of the songs. Its live its raw its good and contains top live tracks from L.A.Guns first four releases and one from Black BeautiesNow Phil is really back."
4,Interesting,"A good sequel to Kerrier District 1. It is always amazing to listen to Luke Vibert's diversity from his Wagon Christ persona to his original Luke Vibert role. If you like Kerrier District 1, this is worth a listen."
4,drummer?,"worth it, does all that it says and freck'n hand as hell, just dont mount it on something that moves alot, high hat, etc, unless you want it in everything"
1,Bad part: noisy with rough finish,"I wanted to try out this pigtail design. But the part that arrived had several problems:- it gives out a loud humming noise as soon as I plug it in- the part has very bad finish (rough painted surface, fuzzy printing, bad fit)I am sending it back."
5,Flex & Tonic...!,"I was introduced to this product while traveling and got hooked. It is great just out of the can, or mixed with your favorite alcohol. Try it - you will love it!"
5,PERFECT Diet (or non-diet) Drink,"I LOVE this drink!!! Great taste with ZERO SUGAR, ZERO CAFFEINE, ZERO SODIUM, ZERO ASPARTAME & only 5 Calories, did I say GREAT TASTE! I've been on the 6 Week Body Make-Over Diet which calls for food & drink with 0 salt, it's very hard to find. Great for those with diabetes or high blood pressure. Go to this company website and check it out, www.nutrisoda.com. My kids love these drinks too! No, I don't work for the company, but I believe in what they are doing, and want them to survive!"
5,Delicious . . .,". . . and may even help my knees. By far the best of the Nutrisoda flavors -- bright, clean, no odd flavors."
3,Incensitive,I love this song. It makes me think a lot about life. She is really putting her heart and soul into this song. I can really understand what she is saying and where she is coming from. Too many of us get hurt by people's actions and it's certain types of songs that help us through it. This is one of those.
5,excellent conveyance of the eastern spirit,"A most pleasing and soothing collection of musical pieces which captures the sometimes elusive, but sensuous, Islamic aesthetic."
4,QUIRKY,"Jazzy....Quirky....Wonderful. Bought this cd for the ' I'm A Very Stylish Girl' song, but I really like the rest of the cd as well."
4,almost di-vinyl,great lark of an album from dimitri. one disappointment though: it doesn't contain the same hidden track at the end. the vinyl issue signs off with one of my favourites.
3,Algo así como... ¿Qué pasó?,"El 2002 fui a cenar con unos primos en Lima, y mi prima me comentó que el otro día fue a ver ""Cry Baby"" y le pareció una mala película. Cuando ella la vió el 91, salió encantada del cine y la vió por lo menos cinco veces. Algo así me ha pasado con este disco. Cuando lo escuché por primera vez y ví el video en MTV, quedé fascinado y me pareció una obra maestra. Pasaron los años y cuando lo compré en el 2002, no me gustó tanto. Ahora, lo que pasa es que los tiempos cambian y la electrónica se está llendo por el drenaje, llevándose discos que en su momento fueron piezas claves como éste."
2,Breathe the French 'AIR' instead......,"not exactly pittzicatto, not exactly spy-jazz, and definietly not as good as their fellow french 'Air' ensemble....he just played this at a club, not a lounge...what's with that? good tunes, but better elsewhere"
5,"""I am a very stylish girl.""","fun jazzy dance music including sampling of voices such as from ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", ""...I am a very stylish girl..."", ""...How do I look?..."""
5,The Best Reference for Childhood,"I am a bit prejudiced when it comes to this hospital. Our daughter is an RN on 3-W.I just love this book. It covers a lot of medical issues, both urgent and not-so-urgent. It helps you calm down in a crisis and it is not so overly wordy that you have to keep scanning to find what you're specifically looking for for advice. Not everything can be taken care of at home and they do not hesitate to tell you to seek emergency action. There's humor (ie. Colds, the Flu and the Great American Runny Nose - Your Basic Everyday Head Bonk), a suggested list of items for your medicine cabinet. There is a large range of ages involved, but most advice can be used by adults, too.This is a GREAT baby shower or newborn gift. I've given several.P. S. Our RN and her husband is expecting their 1st baby and our 1st grandbaby in June. She already has a copy and has given them as gifts to her side of in-laws and friends."
4,Collect this,"From the Bauhaus, Souxsie and the Banshiees gothic scene in the 1980's, this album is still as astounding as it was back then. As for contemporary artists, if you like Marilyn Manson, Nine Inch Nails or Dada Pogrom, then you will probably like this. Call it a classic body of work and the tracks to listen to first are: New Christian Music, Ignore the Machine, and Wish I Woz a Dog. Beware; you might want to buy several copies for your friends too."
5,Finally!,"I have waited years for Designing Women to come out in DVD so I was thrilled when the first and second season came out this year. It has been so long since I saw the episodes originally on TV so it was like watching it for the first time. These four Southern belles never cease to make me laugh, my favorite character being Suzanne Sugarbaker. I have lived in the South all my life so I can relate to the way these ladies look at life. Now just get the rest of the seasons released ASAP although I am not looking as much forward to the last two seasons when Charlene and Suzanne were no longer on. I think the series started going downhill after those two characters left the show."
5,I am happy too but. . .,"Why are they charging so much? I love this series,but am not willing to pay that price.I will wait to buy it used for less!But, I am very glad that they have finally released it."
5,I'm so excited,OMG I grew up on this show and I have always wanted to own all the seasons on DVD. Thank you so much for releasing this.
2,Why so expensive?,"I love this show too, but with only twenty one episodes in the first season set, why is this set so expensive? I'll wait for the secondary market or a nice price drop."
2,Designing Women 1st Season,"I bought several seasons on Designing Women and at least one disk in each of the boxed sets had issues, either it would skip or some of the episodes wouldn't play at all. Since we purchased multiple seasons, it took time before we realized that this issue was pervasive throughout all of the boxed sets. Severely disappointing as this was a gift."
5,Finally!,OH GOSH! This is incredible. Its so wonderful to have this classic show on dvd finally! I LOVE designing women. Oh its such a wonderful show. Its so funny and hilarious. I cant wait to start enjoying the episodes all over again. Such a wonderful show. A must have.
4,Havin fun in the Mancave!,Having a little trouble with the 18 scoring. Have to push it in manually. All in all a great product. Having hours of fun with the guys playing in the Mancave!
3,chijoe,I switched to this board from the halex board this board also plays well very durable easy to read scoring a little bit to much talking from the board though any way if you are buying this board to play againts the computer don't bother it has 5 computer levels the lowest being novice and it aveages a 5.0 so if you are a beginner or even a intermediate player such as myself buying this to practice don't bother it will only frusterate you other than the computer part though a very nice board
3,Stopped working after short time,"This dart board was great fun, but stopped working after a short time. The darts would not register in every area on the board and the voice stopped working also."
2,Darts and mounting hardware not included.,I was very disappointed when I realized no darts or mounting hardware were included like they were suppose to be. AND when we hit the 15 it also lights up like we hit the bulls eye as well. Not worth the price!!!!!!!!!
3,bought this mostly for selectable bullseye,"sometimes darts dont register.mostly this happens with the 18,but has happened with every spot on the board damn near. only other gripe is if you play gotcha! with more than 4 people. 5-8 can't see what 1-4 have to aim for it. all in all tho, i'm happy with my purchase"
4,Good Quality and Lots of Features,"Length:: 4:13 MinsI liked this model so much that I had to create a quick video of it's features. Thanks to Amazon, when I ordered and received the 650 model, I wasn't satisfied with it and sent it back without any problems. I then ordered the 800 series and loved it. Had I seen up close the features, I would have purchased this model the first time around."
2,Vague Posers,"This movie is rude. All 4 characters are unlikeable and immature. It had the atmosphere of GINGER SNAPS, but none of the style, ambition, or clarity of the story telling. by the end of POSERS, I could care less who was trying to backstab and set up who. In fact, I'm still not sure who all killed whom. The character's better-than-thou attitudes was a bit much. The one answered her phone everytime ""Talk!"". If it were me calling her, I'd have an airhorn on my end. Better yet,I'd kill her off first."
1,Poor Design PC,"I absolutely love the PC Paint Remover, but the backing pad leaves much to be desired. It is poor design when the rubber portion of the part breaks, and the only way to replace it is to buy a whole new aluminum casting with rubber pad attached. I would encourage PC to offer a replaceable rubber donut with some adhesive to stick the pad back on. My plan is to find some good rubber material and glue it to the backing plate, so I don't have to get out so much $$ to get up and running."
1,White-Bred,"Bland, soap-Oprahish mix of family matters and faux-pathos. No respect for authors who play it so safe. Where's the friggin angel, except in the marketing department's memo"
2,I got the wrong video!,"Ordered ""Walking Away"" and received the DVD as expected. I just now popped it into my DVD player to watch (about 2 weeks after purchase). Found that I'm watching ""Homegrown Terror"" instead! Hope no one else gets the same...what an inconvenience!"
3,needs engineering,"GREAT MOTOR, SOLID, SMOOTH, POWERFUL, NOW IF WE COULD JUST KEEP THE BLADES FROM FALLING OUT RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE JOB.I'VE READ AND REREAD THE MANUEL, TURNED THE SCREW SO TIGHT I THOUGHT I WOULD STRIP IT. PLUS THE FACT THAT YOU CAN'T FIND PORTER CABLE BLADES."
4,Capable Porter-Cable,"I have used this saw for more than three years. It has been instrumental in building a lot of furniture and a wooden boat. The saw is powerful but very easy to control. As noted by another reviewer, the 90 degree base is limiting. The hook-shank Porter-Cable saw blades are difficult to find, which is too bad since they are a high quality blade. The trigger switch broke on my saw, long after the warrantee was over. Porter-Cable shipped me one, free of cost, in about three days. If this saw ever goes belly-up, I would buy another in a heart beat."
5,Charlie Tanner,Outstanding fixed 90 degree jig saw. If you have ever had one that can tilt you will appreciate a fixed floor. It is so easy to slip up and ruin a good cut with a tilt mechanism. The adjustable guides let you decide the clearance at the foot so as to keep the blade true and square. I would buy again.
1,"""Shallow"" is the word to describe this book","This book is hardly a comprehensive Feng Shui book. The authors has many ""stories"" to tell that fill the book. Each Kwa direction occupies a chapter in the book to a total of eight chapters. However, the author fails to explain how a reader belongs and relate to those directions. The book is niether based on traditional Feng Shui schools such as form or compass schools nor Black Hat Sect's. If you want a ""western guide"" true Feng Shui, read David Kennedy's or Sarah Rossbach's. If you want true traditional feng Shui, read Lilian Too, Lam Kam Cheun, Angi Wang's book. Don't let the title and rating fool you."
3,Just Ok,"Most of the other reviews I've read must have been written by someone who has never read any Feng Shui books before. This book is OK for a beginner, but I borrowed some from my local library that were a bit older, but way better, and with much nicer pictures and more specific fixes and cures. I also bought the Room by Room from the same author and so far I'm a little disappointed. It has a lot of examples but it's not very well written, and it could use more illustrations, and even suggestions on where to buy the crystals and other cure items."
1,"Black Hat Feng Shui Does Not Work, Try Traditional","This was the first type of feng shui I ran into, and being ignorant of the fact that there is more than one kind, thought this was all there was. I faithfully applied everything explained in the book, and -- nothing. Nothing happened. Then I found traditional feng shui through Lillian Too and results started happening, within 10 days and sometimes sooner. Also, what you do to the outside of your house is much more powerful than anything you do inside your house, which this book will not tell you. You can get some of Lillian Too's books on Amazon, she teaches traditional, and is the real deal. Also, Eva Wong, traditional, master at feng shui, excellent information."
3,Readable and interesting with some good ideas,"I found the book to be useful in explaining the elements and giving examples for balancing elements in living spaces. Maybe this isn't the greatest explanation the the traditional Chinese practices and philosophies, but it gave me some good ideas. Psychosomatic? Maybe. But who cares, as long as it has a positive effect? I could have done without the testimonials."
4,The best book out there for people new to feng shui,"Terah explains the key concepts of feng shui, without making them too complicated. It is both thorough and readable. Highly recommended"
4,I need new copy because a friend swiped mine,"I found this book very helpful. It was originally reviewed by a student of mine for a college class which led me to buy Collins' other book ""Feng Shui Room by Room"". I like the other book even better (I would give it 5 stars). These books bring the concepts into focus for use in a western setting. I transformed two major parts of my house within the first week and it was life changing. In fact I was able to make some powerful changes the first night. Also I didn't spend a lot of money but rather used things I already owned and loved that were either in storage or in the wrong place. I found myself loving my house for the first time in many years instead of constantly thinking about moving."
3,Not a bad read!,"I have a hard time actually judging if these books are good or bad, being that I don't really have much of a Feng Shui background.However, the book was easy to read and covered a lot of ground- especially if you wanted to know more about Bagua maps. The advice wasn't too out there, but the examples seemed a little over the top at times.Overall, it wasn't a bad read, and if it doesn't work for you, then move the furniture again! :)"
1,AWFUL! Awful! AWFULL!!,"Anyone looking for the latest white-folk appropriation of a traditional culture need look no further than this New Age trash. It's not bad enough that the material SUCKS, they have to dress it up with more New Age-y psychobabble. Perfect for people who don't think clearly and can't get out of their own way, or that person in your life you want to freak out entirely. They will really think you need to beam back to the Mothership if you fall for this tripe. It was not written as the result of any knowledge of Asian culture, customs, or any scholarship about the subject matter. IT WAS ALL MADE UP BY THE AUTHOR(s). Does that make you want to rush out and buy it?"
3,Happy the Hippopotamus,"This toy is fun for my granddaughter, however, I thought it was going to be a little larger. It is pretty small for what it is."
