3,Muffin is Marvelous!,"Every spare minute I've had in the past month, I've spent with my nose glued to this coming of age tale. I identified with all five characters and found enjoyment in reading about their challenges in transition from adolescence to adulthood. Especially Muffin, who seemed to be the most developed character out of the five girls, whom I most identified with. I was shocked to find out who she married! I did find the writers style to be somewhat confusing as I had minor issues recalling the details of all five characters lives. If the author would have developed each character more and the book would have been a little longer, it would have been a much easier read."
2,"A disjointed, disappointing read","I began reading this book and was halfway thru it when I began to feel let-down and thought maybe I had missed something. The characters were interesting and many subjects were touched on (such as anorexia, bulimia, being overweight), but somehow these problems were solved without any explanation. One character is described as having bulimia, but in the next chapter she is back to ""normal"", and it is never explained or mentioned again! The entire book is like this. Many interesting stories and situations are begun, but just as soon they are brought to an end and I was left frustrated wondering what happened."
2,Not the best of Gutcheon,"Beth Gutcheon knows how to write and she also knows the world of an all-girls private school, where this novel is set. But there are so many characters in this book, and so much happens in approximately 350 pages that it's hard to remain engaged with the action and the characters. I had to fight the temptation to skip ahead in several parts, because I was bored with whatever was going on with some minor character I could barely remember. Like most authors, Gutcheon has gotten better in time and her later books are much better than this one."
4,The New Girls Review,"This novel reminded me of what it was like to go off to a new school. Muffin wanted so much from herself. She wanted to be the popular, beautiful girl. She nurtured a fierce conviction that someday life would give her a chance to show her own unusual self. The story goes through her life at bording school and the changes she begins to see in herself as a young girl growing into a beautiful woman."
2,Very Disappointing,"Based on the reviews I read I decided to buy this book, it was a waste of money. This book has five main characters and it's hard to tell what's going on with whom based on how it's written. There is a lot of profanity and detailed sexual themes in this novel, which I thought were farfetched and unnecessary. The most interesting part of this novel is the end, which describes what happens to the five main characters later in their lives. If you're searching for a good school girl book to read, this is not the one."
3,Good book,The book was a replacement for one I had lost. I just wish the book had arrived earlier than it did.
4,A great Book!!!!,"An interesting insight, (fiction though,) on prep schools, wealth, and women in the early 1960's. This book was wonderful! It is a must for any women of any age!"
2,Early effort,"After being intensely moved by this author's novel More Than You Know, I was gleeful. Aha, a new writer to enjoy! I decided to work my way through her earlier books and started with this one. I think it is her first novel. It feels like one, semi-autobiographical and ridden with remembered angst. Incidents are brought up and then dropped, leaving the reader with a sense of frustration. If I had read this book first, I don't think I would have guessed what a truly fine writer she later turned out to be."
1,Ugh! This book was absolutely terrible.....,"No, no...worse than terrible, it was lazy. This ""coming-of-age"" novel amounted to little more than a few stick figures plodding (clunky Abercrombies on, of course) through some weary story lines. For an entire weekend, I fought my way through this slough, trying to find something -- anything -- that might make me give a hoot about a single one of these characters. My herculean efforts were thwarted, however, by Ms. Gutcheon. With her painfully stilted writing and penchant for orphaning her characters and their development, Ms. Gutcheon nearly drove me to commit literary hara-kiri. While I sincerly hope that The New Girls is an anomaly and that Ms. Gutcheon really is a talented writer of engrossing novels, Lucifer and his impish pals will be winning Olympic gold in Siberia before I pick up another one of her works."
3,Entertaining Steven Seagal Flick.,"Viewed: 11/02, 3/04, 12/05Rate: 512/05: Out for Justice is an entertaining picture but only with Steven Seagal. At least this time, Steven Seagal is able to act more extensively than the previous movies. I wish he could have done a bit more to allow the character some depth to be expanded. As usual, the fighting scenes that Seagal does are great, but too bad, there is too little of them. As far as the story goes, it is pretty good on a complex scale. Much of the movie bothers me a lot because of how Steven Seagal's character seeming to be ""above the law,"" which is illegal on many instances throughout the film. Still, I watch this movie, solely for Seagal's work. I wish the direction was better. This isn't Seagal's fault. I love the way he points the guns while he is moving around. It's quite fun when he does that. All in all, Out for Justice is a perfect Seagal type of a film."
4,Seagal gets it right,"If you want classic Seagal action, then this is it. This really put him on the action movie map(the opening titles are fantastic). Theres nothing at all different about the plot, just that the action is non stop, gratuitous, and gritty. Stash your brain in a safe place, sit back and enjoy. The fight scenes are amazing, and there are more in this pic than in any of his other films. Fortunatly, the film moves along at such a pace that you don't really have time to laugh at the plot or script. You're too busy taking in the graphic spectacle to worry about it.Like i said, this film has absolutly no substance, but is really good fun to watch with buddies.... The only thing stopping it scoring five stars is the complete lack of extras on the disc. The sound (including the music) is great, with full 5.1 support, and the picture is nice and crisp.Get this, its a bargain!"
5,Great Segal title,"Great movie from that era! Good audio and video quality from Prime. However, AMAZON, WE NEED CLOSED CAPTION CAPABILITY TO ALL MOVIES!!!!!"
4,about the movie out of Justice.......,"This title is another win for Seagal movie/film which is recommended to those whom are interested in the Genre of movie. Don't forget to look out for out of justice 2,3,4,5,6 and 7 if any...."
3,Out For BLOOD!!!,"Great action. This is a great movie if you like over the top violence without much story. The fight scenes and shootouts were cool, but those fake Italian accents and the Mob stuff was just plain cheesy and out of place.I like Steven Seagal, but I didn't know who to root for in this movie because everyone was a scumbag, even Gino(Steven Seagal) and his partner.Steven Seagal was out for something in this movie, but I don't think it was Justice."
3,Too Graphic for What Seems so Low Budget,"I am usually a big Segal fan, and find very little wrong with most of his films. This one however is another story. If anyone important to the Hollywood scene sees this reveiw please pass on the fact that it no one should try to make a graphically violent low-budget film. It just doesn't work. The movie had an ok story-line, but there was something missing. Whether it was a better supporting cast, more background on the characters, or what I can not decide. I just wasn't impressed."
3,Good for what it is,"I'll make this one short and to the point. I like ol' Stevie, though even I can admit that other than Above the Law, Under Siege, and this one, he could stand to broaden his horizons. This is, however, my favorite Seagal film. The plot and story are threadbare, but the action, particularly the excellent martial arts scenes, are what street wise aikido is all about, and I can assure you, 99 percent of the moves he does in this movie are what a good aikido stylist would do in a real situation, unless he's smart enough to run away. One particular highlight is a stick fight between Seagal and one time Bruce Lee nunchaku trainer Dan Inosanto. Seagal was supposedly going for a sincere acting performance, but unfortanetly, his dramatic capabilities are as easy on the eyes as his open hand is to your neck. Good fights, plenty of graphic gunshot wounds, and Jason Vorhees himself, Kane Hodder, doing some getting blown away in the movies big brutal finale. Good of its type."
5,LOVED IT,Out for Justice is one of Steven Seagal's best movie. It looked even better on Blue Ray. The fight scenes were epic. Steven Seagal was amazing in this movie.
4,Some Justice For Seagal....,"I get ribbed all the time for my love for Seagal and I admit it...some movies you gotta go, really...like the one where his voice is overdubbed, don't you think a fan can tell but he does have some gems and this is among them for me....how can you go wrong when he kicks the butt of a guy who throws a puppy out the window...my hero : Loved watching this again and now have it on DVD, what could be better, I get to watch again and again : Thanks Amazon :)"
5,rush hour action,this is the best steven seagal film ever hwo cares if it looks like nico its a hole lot better the fights the action the story they are all great its a must see for fans of martial arts and action
4,a power house. pure adrenaline.,"FIRST HE WAS ABOVE THE LAW. THEN HE WAS HARD TO KILL. THEN HE WAS MARKED FOR DEATH. NOW STEVEN SEAGAL IS OUT FOR JUSTICE. HE IS A COP. IT'S A DIRTY JOB. BUT SOMEBODY HAS GOT TO TAKE OUT THE GARBAGE. AND STEVE DOES. HE HAS TO TRY TO STOP A MADMAN WILLIAM FORSYTHE BEFORE IT IS TO LATE. VERY GOOD ACTION SCENES AND SEAGALS MOST GRAPHIC MOVIE. RATED R FOR STRONG VIOLENCE,STRONG LANGUAGE,AND BRIEF NUDITY."
3,Roller coaster ride of bad acting mixed with so so fights,"Seagal, to begin with, never could act his way out of a paper bag. This video is a prime example.(All aspiring actors take note..Make sure your accent (assigned or otherwise) has a semblence of authenticity for the part.) The action scenes were pretty good but, as with most of segals films, poorly filmed. It's my opinion that given Seagal's style of martial arts a different choice of camera angles might help. It's not a bad movie to rent if you've got a couple of cold ones to drink and a couple of hours to put your brain in neutral..."
5,Out for Justice.,"This movie rocks!Rated R for strong violence and language,and for sensulalty and drug use.Canada:R"
3,Seagall as normal,"A typical Steven Seagall movie with plenty of action, reasonable fight scenes, average plot as is always the case with his movies, but watchable - definately more than I can say for Cosmopolis."
2,Lost interest in Seagal because,"There are many movies I just don't enjoy or won't watch anymore because of the Stars politics, it's a shame. I just wish they would keep their political ravings to themselves."
4,NOT THAT BAD,This movie was fine but the action is great here with martial arts.The story line here is like a real life thing.STEVEN plays a 2 faced cop helping the mob.
1,Seagal does an accent! Good stuff...,"Seagal plays Gino, a cop born in the hood of Brooklyn (he does the accent and all) and respected by everyone (isn't Seagal always?). what's great is that this is more of a mob movie than a Seagal action flick but it's done Seagal style for better or worse. Not aterrible movie but not great either. I liked it better on TV last night than I id when I saw it at the theatres when it originally came out. Several supporting performances make it wortha watch such as William Forsythe (CON AIR; CITY BY THE SEA), Gina Gershon (FACE/OFF; SHOWGIRLS), Jerry Orbach, and Julianna Marguiles (THE NEWTON BOYS; GHOST SHIP)."
5,Anything with Joe Dallesandro is guaranteed to be good,"I've got all of Paul Mauressey films. I specially have them because of Joe. I cannot believe this guy did not make it to the highest levels of stardom. The natural beauty and charisma he exhibits is out of this world. I just discovered Joe since I was only a kid back in the sixties, but glad I found his film. Right now I have ""Lonesome Cowboy"" on order, so will let you know my review once it arrives. I just wish this would, and other Joe titles were released on region 1. All his hard to find titles seem to be on pal format :-(."
3,The Fasting Girl,A little bit dry in places. Would have liked more detail on her day to day life. Also sometimes assumed I knew more about the case than I do.
3,Self Conscious About Your Bra,"The bra definitively doesn't poke, but I don't know why, wearing this bra reminds you permanently of it, you are conscious you have a bra on the whole day, so I think it is uncomfortable. It is too much cloth, I think."
1,Drab,"This is certainly one of the worst books in the series not to be outdone by a few others. The book is packed with an adequate amount of action - yet it was still rather difficult to remain interested. The brothers are hardly in Bayport, the writing is weak, and the is little to no mystery whatsoever. The theme is ballooning and naturally it is Chet's hobby. ... The brothers had a lot of interaction with the criminals which was good, and I rank this a strong one star, but not deserving of a 2. RATED D."
2,Dissapointing,"Certainly this book does not live up to its appealing title. It was alright, but does rank among the worst of the series. Not deserving of a 3 rating, which is average. The title only pertains to the last 2 chapters. Very misleading."
1,No way...I'm taking it back,"I bought this same unit at Sears. Put it in my office which is about 250 sq ft and left it on for a few hours. The door was closed and when I went in, it was warm and humid in there. The only place it was cool was right in front of the vents. Could not be less satisfied. I am returning it tomorrow. Last AC I had in office was a window unit that kept the room freezing right up until it konked out last year. Is this portable stuff even worthwhile?"
1,Loud and Ineffective,"I should have known better, because portable air conditioners have such a bad reputation... but I needed to use one thanks to an odd (and unchangable) window configuration. So I trusted that Sears (which sells this model for $499) wouldn't steer me wrong. Shame on me. I should have paid attention to the Consumer Reports reviews -- and now you should pay attention to mind: The unit is entirely inadequate for cooling a 12 by 18 foot room... and it is LOUD. The sales information touts it as ""quiet,"" but you won't be able to sleep in a room with it. The internal ""evaporator"" recycles water over the cooling coils, and the pump that does that makes an annoying whirring sound that'll drive a sane person batty. Yikes. I made a mistake buying this clunker. Time to soak up the 15% restocking fee and get this thing back to Sears."
4,P-view,"awesome album!! Singer Jarrod Gorbel has an awesome voice, soft whisper to a raspy wail. great live, but listening to the album one will find it hard to restrict it anyone genre. It would be best described as anti-folk with indie rock undertones..as if anyone call fully describe indie-rock, in all its wonder you would be safe to say it's rock and roll. personal lyrics with jarrod's voice it's purely...beautifullllll. saw him playing solo w/him and his guitar but in this album the sound is enriched with other instruments....buy it now..if you like it look out for 'The Honorary Title"" new album expected out sometime in June or July '04"
3,Disc holder lacks versatility,"I trust that the other 5 star reviews accurately rate the performance and quality of this tool, but the description does not tell you how the disc pad holder is attached. I returned the SXE400 because it won't accommodate different standard sizes (1"", 2"", 3"" or metric) and types (Roloc, hook and loop, or PSA) disc holders, which usually (in the US) have a 1/4"" threaded or solid shaft. The Metabo uses a 6mm metric allen screw to attach the pad, so you're pretty much stuck with just the Metabo (or similar) 3"" (80 mm) hook/loop type disc. I'm not aware of aftermarket metric sized disc pad holders yet (this may only be a problem in the US). Amazon was fantastic in processing the return."
2,the haunted hotel,i found myself having to resist the urge to put it down before finishing a chapter. the plot is unclear in the beginning. I didnt get anywhere. I would rather reccommend wilkie collin's other books such as the queen of hearts.
2,The Haunted Hotel,"I love to read however, I had a hard time getting into this story line. It plods along without getting to the exciting parts of the story. I set it aside to go back to later. I am glad that it was a free book."
1,Perhaps...,"One would wonder how the book was received upon its inception, way then. Perhaps mentalities were different ; perhaps people were more credulous then. Because this is not a very good book. As a matter of fact, this is verging on a very bad book. It is nicely written but the story is nave and not credible in the least. If you do have an interest in the writings of Wilkie Collins, perhaps ""The Moonstone"" would be a better choice.I wouldn't have given it any star at all, but I haven't figured out how to do so..."
5,The Haunted Hotel,"This is another great book by Wilkie Collins ,although it starts slowly and drags a little until it begins to be very good ,I think this is due to setting the stage for the really great stuff later on. I think this book comes very close to the drama of The Woman in White, a great read and doesn't disappoint."
4,Classic Mystery,"This was a fun read!Written around the late 1870's, it's a mysterious tale with a hint of the supernatural.The story is woven around around both the old and the young between the cities of Londonand Venice. Mr. Collins keeps the pace moving by revealing small pieces of the mysteryat a time and then reeling the reader in with them.I thought that this tale would lean more towards the supernatural side, but the mysterywas well conceived and told and I enjoyed myself anyway.Recommended!"
4,Grim victoriana,"This is the first Wilkie Collins book I've ever read, so I can't compare it to others. However, it stood very well on its own as a classic horror/mystery. The writing style is surprisingly modern considering that it was written in the Victorian period, aside from a few roundabout descriptions of sensitive details. The plot itself, though, didn't hold back any punches. The content and style reminded me of Poe.The characters were more archetypes than drawn from life, but that's what I expected from a Victorian horror story anyway. I liked the little insights into Victorian life (what travel was like, ""the post,"" doctor's visits) but more than anything else just enjoyed the story."
3,Worth reading,"This novel was originally published in 1879, and is still readable today. It does have a nice plot twist, but suffers, as much writiing of that period does, from little sense of urgency. Life was more slowly paced and people had more time to smell the roses.To my thinking, 130 years after the author wrote it, the transitions are somewhat clumsy, and there could be a lot more drama in the story. But allowance has to be given for the era in which it was written. In those days women were delicate flowers, although the Countess is memorable as an exception to the mold.I was surprised that there was so little detail of Venice where much of the story takes place. In fact the subtitle is ""A Mystery Of Modern Venice.""If you collect antiques, this might delight you. For the rest of us, it is a worthy reminder of whence the murder mystery derived."
5,Rousing good mystery from the Dickens-Conan Doyle era,"The fine art of writing a good mystery is to so intrigue the reader that, ponderings of the plot and characters lingering in the mind, draw him/her continually to the story with a hunger for the conclusion that exeeds any other diversion. Such was my experience with this story. Having read The Moonstone and Woman in White by the same author, I expected a quality read. I was not disappointed. A sense of impending doom amid Victorian gothic ambience is painted in the first pages when we are introduced to the Countess Narona, an enigmatic beauty with a soul possessed of a magnetic enchantment and an inner terror that draws the reader immediately into the haunting dark destiny she seeks so desperately to escape. The unfolding of the end at the hotel in ""modern"" Venice THE HAUNTED HOTEL A MYSTERY OF MODERN VENICEis chilling."
4,Near unique blend of detective story and ghost story,"The book's real strength lies in the character of the villainess/ victim Countess. As in Armadale, Collins creates a female character capable of enormous evil,and at the same time so riddled with guilt,and so seemingly trapped by her destiny, that we feel a horrified sympathy for her from the off.None of the rest of the book's characters really come up to the same level, but the plotting as always is excellent, and the variation on the 'substitution' device in 'Woman' marks another first in crime fiction, which has been ripped off ad infinitum. The ending is truly chilling; if the hero(s) and heroine had had a bit more blood in them, this would rank with the very best."
3,Saccharine Gothicism,"When I purchased this book I was hoping for a ""detective"" novel, as Wilkie Collins is considered the father of the English detective novel. His novel ""The Moonstone"" is his most famous for this reason. However, the storyline to ""The Haunted Hotel"" sounded more interesting to me than ""The Moonstone"" so I bought it instead.If you're hoping to read a detective novel, don't buy this. There isn't an ounce of detection, logic or even an understanding of human nature in this work. Nor is there any significant character development of any kind. On the other hand, if you like Gothic literature and don't care a jot about character development, buy the novel and godspeed. This IS a page turner, but almost everything about this novel is so predictably facile that it almost doesn't bear reading.My advice is that if you want something serious, steer clear of this one. If you need a brain candy alternative to TV, this is probably a good bet."
4,...,"...This little volume contains enough suspense, fog, and familial twists-and-turns to satisfy any modern mystery fan (if one overlooks the inherent sexism that dates this book)...not to mention the delicious sense of voyeurism in peeking in on this group of gentle Englishfolk. Read it and remember when mystery writers could actually write."
1,Very unsophisticated attempt at developing intrigue and drama - a stinker,"I really enjoyed Wilkie Collins' The Moonstone and The Woman in White. They are are much better written, more developed in technique and quite engaging, enjoyable stories. The Haunted Hotel is just rubbish"
1,"ROBBINS DESERVES 5 STARS FOR SELF PROMOTION, 1 FOR MATERIAL","Anthony Robbins is a master of promotion---that is his forte. He is also very convincing and his information does have some value. If you are interested in rapid change, check out NLP-- ""THE NEW SCIENCE OF PERSONAL ACHIEVEMENT"" by the NLP COMPHREHENSIVE TEAM or PASSION, PROFIT & POWER by MARSHAL SILVER. Anthony Robbins offers a 30 day program, Marshall Silver offers a 3 day results program. I also highly recommend books by Naplolean Hill and Jim Rohn. If you want content, not fluff."
4,Tony Robbins Insight Has Helped Me Earn my First 5 Figure Month Online,Awaken The giant Within by Tony Robbins is a life changing book. I have been able to create a cash flow of over 5 figures a month online. I over came what I thought I could never earn over 30K a year..I had limiting thoughts. Once I took action on what is taught by Tony it changed instantly for me. (...)
5,How to Awaken the Giant Within You!,"Throughout my life I have read countless self-improvement books; however, there are only a few which I can say made lasting and positive changes in my life...""Awaken the Giant Within"" is one of those rare texts.I became aware of Tony's book at a critical moment in my life. I was facing many challenges without a clear vision of what my next move should be.Tony gave me the strength to take ACTION by showing me that past failures did not determine future events. He also gave me the tools to chart a new destiny for myself and create a life full of passion.""Awaken the Giant Within"" is a phenomenal book that helps you in defining your future with extraordinary enthusiasm!Brian J. MarinelliAuthor,Discover Your Inner Strength: FREE BONUS: 10 Steps to Inner Strength Special Report,Make People Like You: How to Win Friends and Influence People in 60 Seconds or Less!

3,Awaken the Giant,"This CD has it's moments. If you are looking for for a jump start on life change it is not bad. Some of the info on goal setting is helpful. I can't say that I would recommend this to friends, although I certainly wouldn't condemn it to them either. This CD outlines a few goal setting strategies flavored by some classic tenets of motivational speakerism and cognitive behavioral therapy. I liked the emphasis on doing and on accountability towards life change. I bought this CD used for about $3.00, I did get my money's worth."
1,If he had only walked the talk,"I have read all of Tony Robbins books, used to listen to his audio tapes in the car, went to Chicago for ""Unleas the Power Within"" and to Hawaii for Life Mastery but when I found out that he was divorcing his wife Beckie because he had found another girl (I was told she was one of the many volunteers who attend Robbins' conferences to make them run smoothly), I lost all respect for the man. He used to regale us with Beckie stories and made it sound as if this were the marriage of the century. How can we believe anything he as to say now? He is just another adulterer with the requisate trophy wife. God, the hypocrisy. Making millions of dollars preaching one thing, and doing anothr. There's a lot of money in bilking people these days, as Mr. Robbins has found out. The book is well-written and does have time-tested theories, but how can one take it seriously?"
1,Hoax in the United States!,"Yes! I agree with the word ""hoax"" from another user! Tony is a hoaxer. Nobody deserves to loose all their money to buy those junk tapes and books!!"
4,Good Book,"This is a pretty good book but a bit dry in places. It also needs to be updated. Some fresh, more timely stories and examples would be nice, but the concepts presented are worth the read."
5,Life changer,I am a investment advisor and this book is a significant reason for my success. It provides you examples of how others achieved their goals and what you need to do to achieve yours. It is a blueprint for excellence!
3,Books don't give you the REAL Tony Robbins!,"A couple years ago, I was fortunate to be among some sales reps who were sent to a one-day Tony Robbins seminar! ONE DAY with this man is to be buoyed up for DAYS! I can only imagine what an entire workshop with him would be like! You leave pumped up and full of ideas and enthusiasm. I'm not fond of Robbins' books ONLY because you REALLY have to experience him first hand. I don't know that I would have spent the money on a seminar, books or tapes had I not had the first one paid for by my company. I must say though, NOW I would save up to attend one of his weekends or seminars! The books are simply ""texts,"" you get out what you put in! Robbins' is a magician! If you get a chance to experience this phenomenon....GO!"
3,A STEP ABOVE POSITIVE THINKING,"Anthoy Robbins has written a very good book on how to create change rapidly with NAC. It's better than pure positive thinking. I think a lot of the ""fat"" could have been taken out and the repeated information from Unlimited Power could have been left out. My only major gripe is Robbins constant self promotion and advertising his ""Date with Destiny"" and other seminars. He also makes it sound like he invented NAC (actually NLP-Neurolinguilstic Programmng) and that his NAC is somehow better and different than NLP. Overall, I think it's a good book, especially for people unfamiliar with NLP and unlike other NLP books is easy to read. I also highy recommend ""7 Strategies for Wealth & Happiness"" and ""The Art of Exceptional Living"" by Jim Rohn. ""NLP-The New Science of Personal Achievement"" by NLP Comphrehensive is one of the best pure NLP books & NO FAT OR HYPE!"
5,Everything is there for Your life to Get at its best.,"This book just put it all together for me. Every sentence is dear to me. Since I loved it all, help me to dislike it."
5,would definitely recommend!,would completely recommend to others. Anthony Robbins is one of the best motivational speakers of our time. I have no complaints with his audo cd's I also bought the power to shape your destiny and awaken the giant within. Also both great audio Cds. Cant go wrong. I purchased all 3 of these titles for my husband who went to a Anthony Robbins seminar and listened to them in his long car rides to and from work. he absolutely loves them :)
5,success became cheap for me...,"i never knew i will experiences significant change in an instant.i began aware of the forces of change like decision:path way to success made my life renewed.i now can dream without fear.""utopia today reality tomorrow"" gave me faith.my life success will be attributed to anthony robbins.in his words""when we shake hands"" made me feel great about myself.it's impossible to fail after reading this life transforming book!!!"
5,Words cannot describe the effect it has on you,"I read this book in 1999. I was without a job for 6 months. But having read this book at the start of the 6 months helped me to pull through the difficult phase of being jobless. Never once did I feel that I will not get a job. Also, by applying CANI I was able to cut down my driving time from 1 hour 30 min to 45 minutes, other factors remaining constant. It is difficult to express the improvements in my life here after reading this book."
4,Love this book,"At first the book is hard to get into, but after about 20 minutes it gets better and more informative. Don't make the mistake of overlooking this VERY HELPFUL BOOK"
4,"My Coach, Anthony Robbins","being a NLP Practitioner myself, I enjoy to gain more knowledge by an expert like A.Robbins. Every time I listen to the CD, I learn something new."
3,I've read better...,"Robbins has a lot of good ideas but he is a terrible writer. It's hard to extract what to use from his book and harder still to get through it. He seriously needs a ghost writer to package his material. Same with his tape series-- could be incredibly condensed so that one can pull out the useful material.If you want to get something out of this book, I suggest you take it a chapter at a time and really think hard about how to apply it to your life. Like I said, the information is good but he doesn't exactly help you get to it!"
2,Hella long,"If you have time to read a 9 billion page book written on bible paper that tells you how to be motivated and succeed then you have more problems than this book can solve. I bought it cause I was curious about his message but I could not get past the first 200 pages of the same repeated general message. Its like having sex on crystal meth, It builds up but wont deliver."
2,"while yer at it, read The Power Of Negative Thinking by....","Gerald Amada....I studied with the same guys that Tony studied with and a whole lot more to boot. Did all the Erhard based trainings.Tony doesn't necessarily have more skills or more raw I.Q. than a lot of the originators, he is a lot prettier, has more stamina, and the man knows how to work the stage with the best of them.Go for it if you think it will help you make your way through life more elegantly. It may, it may not.Be smart. Consider the other side of story. Negative thinking is a survival necessity. The more Tonified you get yourself, the more you need to balance your scales. Learn about making a useful alliance with your negative thinking. Positive needs Negative, Negative needs positive....Like, what is the sound of one hand clapping? Nothing. Doh."
1,Forget this ignorant rubbish,"Read Krishnamurti, I Am That: Talks with Sri Nisargadatta and books on nueropsychology. Egocentric rubbish like this book is the actual problem."
2,Do what I say not as I do,"Tony Robbins expouses the value of food combining particularly in Unlimited power, however, on his web site (in fun facts)his favorite meal below is shown.Favorite Meal - Caesar Salad, Mashed Yams and Grilled SwordfishUnless Iam very much mistaken this is completely contradictory to the principles of food combiningAfter contacting his office I was told "" he doesn't eat them all at once""I find it very difficult to recommend a book if the author does not adhere to the principles."
2,Give Credit Where Credit Is Due,"The book has some great information that, when applied, can make some significant changes in a person's life. After reading numerous other works from authors in the self-help and academic arena, I discovered that a lot of what Mr. Robbins shares is the work of other people who paid the price to learn the techniques and methods. The information is based on sound research, yet very little is credited to the researchers. Just one of numerous examples is the concept of NAC. Mr. Robbins was in a legal dispute for using NLP, so he simply changed the name, added a few twists, and voila -- a new change technology. The information gets an ""A"", but Mr. Robbins gets a ""D-"" for ethics."
3,Not his Best work,"I have recently become an Anthony Robbins fan, I attended one of his seminars, and have bought several of his tapes and cd's since. This CD is OK...(I have not read the book yet) but I think that the better investment is Personal Power. I think it's a great CD to start with, but you shouldn't judge him by it... check out Personal Power I or II, and you will see his true genius... But if you want the full effect, go to his seminars... I highly recommend it!"
2,Not for me,I love to read & love to learn. This book is just to thick & boring for me. I didn't get far before it was put us.
1,Guy with an ego telling you how great he is,"WOW was I disappointed in this!I was going through a rough patch last year so thought I'd do something out of the ordinary and read self-help. I am a big fan of the Malcom Gladwell books, so maybe I was expecting something along those lines.This book was EXACTLY what I always imagined self-help to be and exactly why I have never read any. It's so bad it's almost a parody of itself. This guy is repetitive and psuedo-modest. Every chapter felt the same. It never felt like he was getting anywhere.Don't bother! I'm sure it's for a certain breed, but I certainly can't tell you which."
5,a Must Read from the Best in the industry!,"Wow there is an unmeasurable amount of value in here. The insight in this book has literally saved lives, and this is something that I've personally seen and experienced with many friends. I'm really not sure what else needs to be said. Please ignore those negative reviews and let me ask you a question... How much would you be willing to pay for the chance to dramatically transform your life?Tony Robbins is the pinnacle of the success and personal development industry and a trusted source to some of the most successful and trusted minds! Speaking of which, Oprah was just fire-walking at one of his Unleash the Power Within events. Check out the pic, read the article, and choose to take action NOW and order this book! You only get one chance at living life![...]"
4,Good refresher.,"I have read the book several times.....AWESOME!! I got the book on tape to share with my husband.....like I said, it is a good refresher...but, you miss out if you don't read the book.....so much more valuable information shared"
5,Incredible Self-Development Book!,"This is one of the best books I've read on self-development. Tony covers so much, yet keeps it thorough and meaty. The book changed my thinking and attitude. I would recommend this book to anyone!"
5,Change can begin now. Change is a process.,"""As a man thinketh, so is he."" For many years, I studied self-improvement books. I like ""Awaken the Giant within"" for a number of reasons: 1) Concepts are clearly described 2) Assignments to apply the concepts take place immediate 3) Feed back on the results can be examined and quantified. The book is not a passive discussion of philosophy, but basic day to day paradims which apply directly, into your life. Here some of the valueable concepts I've learned: increase your net worth begins by increasing the value you offer daily. Increase the payout you provide increases your hourly wage. Second, change is a matter of focusing on pleasure and deterence from old behavior patterns is the result of pain. Third, creating 10 totally positive days. I haven't yet accomplished this assignment, but just three days or one day in a month is amazing. I will be happy to share other insights, but reading the book is really the key, to begin your self-improvement journey."
1,Resist the Temptation,"All these power people pushing their own agendas has left little respect for others. These are the people who drive 95 miles an hour and run you off the road, the people who care about nothing but materialism, the people who are setup for shallow relationships and failed marriages. I don't want to meet power people, I want human beings who care about others, value something other than money and success, can deal with conflict in ways other than trouncing weaker people, who live by morals and ethics and respect others' boundaries, who think about something larger than themselves, and who build intimate lasting friendships instead of hollow feel-good encounters devoid of meaning."
2,Anthony Robbins knows how to sell the big talk !!,"He knows what sells in the market and people are hungry for advise and motivational talk.I would not recommend this one but real inspirational book instead books by Joseph murphy, Napolean Hill etc.I would rather get an advise from an achiever and not only 'Talk'er."
2,Over Rated,"The material is very disorganized and he constantly jumps from one topic to another within sections. He talks about himself way too much. And I don't think he goes in depth enough in the topics. Like for example the first chapter is about making decisions. He says that decisions can change your life in an instant and gives examples of people who have made important decisions and concludes that decisions can change your life. He gives no strategy for improving your decision-making skills besides ""make more decisions"". He does seem to have a lot of energy, which can be motivational. I'm going to guess that the motivational component is what is getting his high ratings, but I don't think the strategies he gives are very good."
2,Not that good.,This book will appeal mostly to the the infantile/gullible. I have spoken with at least a dozen people who bought this book and Robbins persona power program--No noticeable improvement.One guy was a janitor ten years ago making $7.50 a hour. Today he is still a janitor now making $8.75 a hour. Whopee.I would recommend Sleight of the Mouth and Beliefs by Robert Diltz and the original NLP books Tranceformations by Bandler and Grinder for outstanding NLP techniques without the hype and b.s.
3,"Solid on Content, Yet Unnecessarily Convoluted","Anthony Robbins covers a vast amount of information regarding personal achievement and taking control of your life starting from your own attitude and habits. There are countless books on discovering individual achievement and few packs as much content as Awaken The Giant Within.The volume of content in this book is a double edged sword; whereas Robbins in clearly in possession of considerable knowledge on the topic yet appears to have difficulty or a lack of interest articulating his points with any brevity. Robbins could have cut this book into a fifth its size and maintained its usefulness.Robbins has the ability to motivate and this book will give certainly give you an uplifting pep talk...if you can get through it quick enough. There are, however, many books on personal achievement that are far superior (Think & grow Rich, Magic of Thinking Big) that get to the heart of the material more rapidly and articulate their intent better."
4,Great Read and Easy to Apply,I found this book in good condition.A great self help book.Anthony Robbins's NAC methods to create change in oneself is easy to apply.Happy Reading
3,Great price / Different cover,"I was hoping to get the ""newer"" updated version ( cover ). Hopefully there were no other revisions to the book.As for the book itself Anthony Robbins, has opened my mind to the way people think, see and hear one another. Anthony is long winded in his stories and tells several long winded stoires in each chapter. Still the information is very and hopefully I can start putting some of it to use."
4,Powerful Toolkit,"Used as a toolkit coupled with willpower brings results. Tony is an amazing and inspiring guy. This book could change your life. I say could, it probably won't as most people (as Tony admits) only read the first chapter or so of any book and then give up. Persist with this book and then APPLY it. Only then will you see the difference."
2,"INSPIRATIONAL, BUT LACKING SUBSTANCE","I have a library of 300-400 cassettes and at least as many books, most dealing with motivation and personal development and nobody speaks with the power of ROBBINS. I bought UNLIMITED POWER, AWAKEN THE GIANT and his PERSONAL POWER audio program. I read the books, listened to the tapes, did all of the exercises but nothing really dramatic happened. It was just like other books and tapes that get you all reved up and then you say ""wow, what was that all about"" and your back where you started from. I got mre benefit from NLP-The New Science of Achievement by NLP Comphrehensive than from all of ROBBINS material. I also strogly recommend the old but timeless classc ""Think & Grow Rich"" by Naploean Hill and ""Business Buy the Bible"" by WADE COOK."
1,Don't waste your money!,Junk! It's just plain stupid and childish. Tony Robbins must be really bored or something to spend his entire life preaching that nonsense. He spends his entire life taking money from all those poor souls...
5,Anthony Robbins is the BEST of his genre,"If you are looking to really get in touch with your inner greatness then run out and buy this book ... seriously run now ... stop reading this review, close this window and order Awaken the Giant Within ... nowwwwwwwwwww"
3,A WRITTEN INFORMERCIAL,"While a lot of the material is good and applicable, ROBBINS constant self-promotion,story telling and pitching his overpriced seminars and other programs and products gets a little old. This books size could have been condensed easily by 1/3 to 1/2 by taking the crap out. I tried the NAC techniques and found them to be very superficial and short-lived. If you want real results, check out Brian Tracy's ""MAXIMUM ACIEVEMENT"" or Marshall Silver's ""PASSION, PROFIT & POWER"". I don't recommend Robbins nutritional program either. Like NAC, it gives a temporary, false boost. No one I've talked with and this includes nutritional and medical experts support this plan."
1,THE TRUTH ABOUT ANTHONY ROBBINS,"I have known Tony for a number of years and it is now time to openly denounce him for what he is worth: 1) Think Tony is against drugs? Well, sorry to let the truth into the way of a good story, but he was caught with illegal drugs when crossing the Canadian border in 1976! So the miracle is how he managed to keep it secret for all those years...2) He teaches about relationships but he is getting divorced (!).3) He makes huge money on people's misery.4) He was sued 4 times since 1984 for lying to the public (e.g., for years, he used to claim that firewalking was a ""mind-over-body"" experience that people could only achieve through years of experience or through his seminars)5) His techniques don't work."
1,"Tony's ""seminar trap""",This book clearly lacks content and it's sole purpose is to make more people want to go to Tony's seminars and to buy more books and tapes.
1,Save your money,"This book is the author's poor attempt to make a fast buck riding from his previous bestseller, ""Unlimited Power"". If you must find out what this is all about, get ""Unlimited Power"" instead - very similar bs but better or EVEN better, search for books on NLP. If you want a real self-help book, get ""The Power of Your Unconscious Mind""."
5,Wake Up and Smell the Passion!,"Go ahead. Make fun of his tan and the infomercials if you want. The reality is, Tony Robbins is the real deal. I've been listening to his tapes for years. Few come close to making as much sense and giving me the kick in the pants I sometimes need to get (and keep) life and business on track. ""Awaken the Giant Within"" contains much of Robbins' most powerful material. Get it. Read it. Live with passion!-Bob Baker, author, ""Guerrilla Music Marketing Handbook: 201 Self-Promotion Ideas for Songwriters, Musicians & Bands"""
4,"achieving excellence is the goal, not to become NLPer","after reading the comments about this book i decided to give my view point as well. though this book is not the last word in human excllence yet a powerfull addition. however i would like to draw the attention of readers of a beautiful sentence in robbins book. he says that i dont want you to become NLPer. i want u achieve excellence. so i believe those trying to get complete NLP information from this book will be disappointed. achieving excllence is the goak, NLP just one of the many availbable tools. so if u want to achieve exclence, read this book and practise it. im sure u will not become NLPer but u will become extraordinary humanbeing."
4,tony fan,"i read this book a few months ago and it inspired me to make a lot of necc. changes in my life. it helped me get out of a hurting relationship, make HUGE career changes, and put me on a better track for my health.i purchased the audio tapes for personal power and get the edge to listen to in my car (because all i do is drive out here). whenever i read the book, which i often do to remind myself of certain things, i can visual Tony as a coach. truthfully, yes, it is a book and will not help anyone UNLESS they really want it to. when you make the commitment to change, you can. this book is ONLY A TOOL. it will not make the changes for you. of course, with book that is a couple of hundred pages, there will be parts that you can speed through, but overall, you highlight the pages and sentance most applicable to your life."
4,One of the Better Self-Help Books Out There.,"I found this to be the better of Tony's two books (the other being 'Unlimited Power'). While the stories can at times be drawn out and I wished he would get to the point, it can't denied be that this book contains a lot of great information and its also great that Tony is able to explain it all in such a clear and (mostly) entertaining way."
1,Pompous Power Hungry Greedy Ideology,"I can think of no more obnoxious concept than one which teaches us to do POWER TRIPS on others so as to make ourselves feel better, often at the other person's expense. It flies in the face of all that is Christian, polite, moral, and kind. That Americans are on such a mental trip says alot about our culture, food, mass media, Television - and the way in which GREED is the Number One driving force for most people. Tony Robbins, in my opinion, has done a lot of damage to interpersonal relations."
2,Not happy!,The ring itself is beautiful. But after about 4 months of wear the band started changing colors. I type at a computer all day so my hands arent in hard chemicals and I dont wear it in the shower. For the money I spent on this ring I was not that impressed that it started changing colors so quickly. Won't be buying another ring from this company anytime soon!
3,"interesting material, poor presentation","This book covers some interesting material; I especially liked the chapter which discussed obtaining the results of a quantum computation without actually running the computer. The authors also give some very complete explanations of fundamental concepts such as the workings of a quantum logic gate and RSA encryption. However, their explanations are also riddled with errors and undefined notation. Often, they will spend a great deal of time explaning rather trivial things, then in the next paragraph introduce the next step with a new notation and not define it!! The result is that the calculations are often hard to follow.This book is a good read for those interesting in learning about the basics of quantum computers, but look elsewhere for a more rigourous treatment of the mathematics of quantum computing."
5,Bassist's lesson plan,"If you are a bassist or a wannabe bassist, this CD is a must. The bassist on this CD is so tight with the drummer. Yet if you listen close, you can hear some subtle bass lines that are incredibly tasteful. This is a blues bassist's lesson plan."
4,Ireland's tragedy in 176 pages !,"This is a brief and impartial account of the history of Ireland from 3000 BC up until 1994 . There is no in depth analysis of the historical figures involved but just a simple yet concise narative of the important events that shaped this country .It is after England's brutal conquest of the native Irish , and the protestant plantations that followed , that this book comes into it's own , as it gives the reader a clear understanding of the political dynamics at work that would eventually lead to a divided Ireland .The book has a generous amount of illustrations and photographs that compliment the very readable text . I'd recommend this book as a starter to anybody who is interested in finding out about the tragic history of Ireland , or as an overview to more in depth books for the discerning reader ."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"This is truly one of the most lacking of the general histories of Ireland available on the market. Conor Cruise O'Brien and Maire O'Brien provide a rather pourous account of the history of Ireland and manage to not quite even skim the surface. Leaving out many of the events that would embarass the author or not promote his own political agenda, this book is at best a waste of time. There are many, many better accounts available."
4,Great Popcorn Maker,We have this machine in our office of approx 40 people. We pop 2-3 times daily. No problems with the machine at all. The light has already burned out but it probably has been left on more than was needed. We knew we needed a machine that could handle some quantity and this one fits the bill.
4,Beautiful!!,"Beautiful, well designed. Bigger than some that are out there. Only complaint is that poor shipping quality. Box was beat up so badly. Machine had major dents on the top metal piece. Don't recommend as a gift if the person who you are giving it to lives in your house as it says EXACTLY what it is on the outside of the box. Makes good popcorn though."
3,Good but not the best,The Lucy Show Vol. 1 - Lucy Meets The Berles/Lucy and George BurnsThis DVD is misleading. I was hoping to get a vol. of the first season of Lucy Show. It's not. It has good shows from the later seasons without Ethel. They are entertaining with Mr. Mooney but not the best of the series. A true Lucy fan would enjoy them.
2,Nice features but major hiss,"I bought this a few weeks ago and expected it to provide the same if not better quality than my old 900MHz Panasonic, which started dying prematurely after 3 years of little use, but I was surprised to find this phone to be worse than my old one. There's a constant loud hiss that can be heard when using the phone. I tested it against another 900MHz Panasonic at home and validated that it wasn't the phone line. In addition, the same loud hiss can be heard even with the intercom feature. I really like the built in lcd in the handset, which allows easy access to recently dialed numbers and a phone book but the quality of the call is more important to me than the features however nice they are; after all it is a phone! I'm not sure what to move on to now since it doesn't seem that manufacturers make 900Mhz anymore... oh well, the search continues."
2,Dissatisfied,"I am very dissapointed with the transmitting and receiving range of the phone. The reception quality begins to degrade at about 25 feet. I can not use the phone at the opposite end of my small house! The voice quality is fair to good. I have been a die-hard Panasonic fan for years but after this and a seperate purchase of an unrelated Panasonic product (alarm clock) that I am dissapointed with, I am beginning to question all their products."
4,My four year old loved it.,"My four year old son loved this book. We checked it out from the library, and now we have to buy our own copy. Pearl, the heroine is lovable and the amazing (talking) bone is smart and quick- witted. My son loved this book because of the power the bone gave pearl. The power to overcome the evil villians and go home fearless."
2,Parents - review this one carefully before buying,"This book horrified me. Maybe it's no worse than Hansel and Gretel, but between the awful attempted robbery, the abduction and the graphic description of the fox planning to cook and eat the sweet heroine --- YIKES. I wouldn't want to read this to my daughter. If you're a Steig fan, be sure to look this one over and decide for yourself if it's right for your child prior to buying it."
3,Not for Little Ones,"My 3 year old is fascinated by the concept that we all have bones in our bodies, so I hastily selected this book right before Christmas without really reading it. Big mistake! The plot heavily features armed robbery, kidnapping, false imprisonment, and intent to murder the main character. A little heavy for her, in my opinion. She seemed to take it in stride, but I was apalled.Also, since my main reason for choosing this book was in response to my daughter's interest in bones as part of our anatomy, I was disappointed that there is no explanation where the bone in this story comes from...is it a human bone or an animal's bone? How did it come to be able to talk? And why is this magic object a bone and not an amazing rock or feather or something else?On the other hand, the illustrations are lovely and the story is interesting, though odd, for older children."
3,Beautifully illustrated but not for young children.,"I bought this book based on the fact it was a Caldecott Honorable Mention and based on the reviews. I have to say my son loved the book until we got to the part where robbers in Halloween masks jump out of the bushes and put a gun to Pearl's head. Hello? You reviewers out there. My son (3, almost 4) was shocked. He asked a zillion questions about the robbers. Weren't they bad? Did they hurt Pearl? Why (how come) they were robbing her? The next day the questions continued. I bought 10 Caldecott books and we were reading the books right out of the box and I failed to preview the story. Big mistake. This book is charming and wonderful except for the robbery scene which is graphic and extremely disturbing. That scene also seems out of place. In my opinion, it does not belong in a children's book. Parents of young children--beware of this book. Adults, enjoy it."
1,Frightening - and not in a fun way.,"This book shocked me, and I am NOT an over-reactive type of parent. My daughter picked this up in a waiting room and we were reading happily together. I couldn't believe it when our heroine suddenly had a gun to her head!! And abducted and taken to an abandoned house where she is left in a room alone to ponder an imminent death? Yeah, of course she escapes. But then she merely goes home where the entire incident is glossed over. It was the strangest children's book I have ever seen and certainly the most unpleasant."
1,Entertaining,Loved this movie's 'expert.' Now I want to watch a documentary of a zoologist explaining everything there is to know about human teeth.
4,Some overlap with other CD's,"but has some gems: ""It's Crazy"" with Sarah Vaughan, ""Stardust"" with live string section arr./conducted by Neil Hefti, ""I've got you under my skin"" with Dinah Washington, ""Yesterdays"" with Quincy Jones jazz orchestra."
4,"Music of ""Light"" and Love","This is an outstanding CD! With the recent ""Latin Explosion"" on the US scene this is truly one CD to have on your shelf! The song that got me hooked was ""Cree Mi Amor"". It was featured on the daytime soap opera, Guiding Light as the first song that Danny and Michelle Santos danced to as husband and wife. Beautiful and breathtaking are two words to describe this CD."
1,You've Got to be Kidding,"This was the most insulting book I've ever been asked to read. It was simplistic, childish, and saccharine. I've read comic books that had more depth! In my view, anyone who buys into this cartoonish nonsense doesn't have the intellectual horsepower to lead an organization of any size."
1,Wretched,"My wife got this book for free at work. She was overcharged.I cannot imagine anyone gleaning even a particle of insight from this lump of inedible gelatin. You will ask yourself one question over and over as you read this book, and that is: ""Why did I bother to learn to read?""For all those who read and rave over this book, please be kind enough to indicate in your review the company for which you work. I would like to short your company's stock."
1,Wasnt revolutionary in 1993 and surely isnt now!,This book is a light quick read with nothing of much substance. A page in a marketing book will cover more than this whole book when it comes to customer service.
2,Effective Review on this Book..,"A review doesn't have to be 5 paragraphs. This book was a simple story which illustrated a simple point about customer service. That's it. I purchased it thinking I would have ""Raving Fans"" but the book is far too simple and effective service is more complex. If you're hungry for growth and knowledge don't read it or feel influenced to purchase it. It's something I would imagine a very low level customer service worker reading for a little inspiration. If you're starving for just a little inspiration and 2nd grade storytelling, then purchase it."
1,Not So Raving Fans,The Raving Fans audio book that I purchased was poorly acted (the character voices were so forced and contrived)and the content was so common sense that I learned little from it. I have listened to many audio books and this was the least enjoyable of all.
4,Core Principles of Customer Service,"A fast read that focuses on the core principles of customer service. More than anything, think of this as a means of establishing customer-centric thought patterns in your personnel."
2,Really?,"The company that I work for made us read this among other ""motivational books"". What has happened to this counrty that books like this need to be written? My god this is common sense stuff, nothing profound or revolutionary here. I dont need to get on an ""enegry bus"" or ""learn to make soup"" to be self motivated, have pride in what I do and convey that to and motivate my team to be the same. A manager that need these sort of trite drivel to properly manage and motivate his team needs NOT be a manager."
2,Perhaps could be considered intellectual... to a 1st grader.,"This story is so dumbed down. Made me feel the author has tiny respect for our abilities to think for ourself. The basic idea behind the book is sound, but you don't need to read it. Go above and beyond for your customers and you'll always have fans."
4,To all the nay sayers.....,"See ya, would hate to be your cio/ceo. It's just that simple. change is good, if you don't, bye. i extrapalated the simple concepts to help build the best suite of teams' of employees. Something like i have a vision for my team of managers, and part of that vision is what they need from me, they in turn need to develop their own vision of their team which includes what their team members need from them. By building that type of relationship/team, we can really provide an exceptional product."
4,Hits major points of outstanding customer service.,This is a great book that has some great jems of knowledge. Though written in a fairy-tale format it makes some outstanding points on what it means to give superb customer service. The only way that I could really see it improve is to have some real life examples...but this would ruin the fairy-tale style of the book. I would recommend this easy and fast read book to anyone who is interested in opening their eyes to increasing customer appproval.
3,Raving Fans,This book was ordered for a group striving to improve their work skills. Using it for business is mainly what it appears to be for.
4,Horror Fiction,"This book is sold as how-to guide for customer service--but don't be fooled. This is the story of a man on the edge. Consumed by the conflict between his desire to succeed and his love of golf--yet crippled by ineptitude--he begins to hallucinate an imaginary character to assist him in achieving his goals. Somehow, through the power of his imagination, he succeeds in his goals--but at the cost of his sanity."
2,More fluff when I want more meat!,"Hmm, there are points in this book that are great, but was put into a fable that just distracted from the good this book was offering. Customer Service is mediocre at best these days and just by going a little above and beyond can make a difference with your customers and turn them into ambassadors for your business. I just wish Mr Blanchard[author: Ken Blanchard] stuck with the points of the book and developed real world examples around them and how to do the work in a more informational format. The attempt at building a story around the points and even how it's attempt at relating to the reader was more of a distraction than it was a reinforcement."
4,Interesting ideas and a quick easy read.,"This is a quick and easy book to read. The concepts presented in this book to improving Customer Service is very possible. The ideas presented is interesting and really makes me aware how I have been ""just satisfied"" with all the bad customer service all around us. Ken gets his points across by using short events and dialogs between the characters. However, the short events, products, etc... seems to be too fantasy and very fictional. I would have been more convinced if he had used real life examples. The concepts presented, however, are very logical and very implementable."
2,Not my style,"The information I learned from listening to this book on tape was somewhat usefull. My biggest complaint revolves around the presentation of the material. The juvenile voice ""acting"" bordered on being insulting. I very much regret this purchase."
2,Nice concept...poor execution,"I'm excited by the concept of Raving Fans, but the author uses a storytelling approach with a fairy god mother (no kidding) to talk about a few simple principles."
5,Excellent quick read that makes some great points,"Definitely worth reading for a fresh perspective on any kind of customer service. (We're in software.) Fresh, not rehashed ideas."
3,definitely will make a difference,"This is not a new book, but the message is as meaningful today as when the book was first introduced. If you think you have a great business because you have satisfied customers, you really need to read this. Satisfied customers are not enough! You need to have ""raving fans"" who become evangelists for your products or services. If you haven't read this book yet, get it today. It will definitely make a difference."
4,KISS,"Keep It Simple Stupid...and Ken Blanchard does just that! What a cold bucket of ice water this tome must be for business owners and employees everywhere. As Ken points out, service is so bad everywhere, you just have to do a few little things well to stand out and succeed. Listen to the audiobook and find out how to make a few small adjustments in your customer paradigm and see the huge results follow. Tho only drawback to the audiobook was one of the actor's voices...the Fairy Godmother nearly drove me up a wall."
1,Simplistic and unrealistic,"This book claims to teach readers about great customer service. Unfortunately the examples of great customer service in the book are made-up companies that would not be in business if they really existed. I'd much prefer to read about the customer service practices of real organizations that are renowned in their field, like Nordstrom, USAA or the Ritz Carlton. (Or Amazon!)"
2,Raving Fans,The other 2 books I ordered came in days from other companys.This books has taken a month and I still don't have it.Slow service. Hope you don't want your book right away!!
2,More of the same!,"While short and to the point can be good, I found this book to be more of the same. One can only read so many short stories and try to apply them to real life situations. Having recently completed my MBA, I decided to take a break from the standard MBA text; however, I do find those books more meaningful.I'll stick with Who Moved My Cheese as my recommended business story book."
1,Fluff & Stuff - Nothing Useful or Tangible,"I read the reviews and had to agree with a number of the comments such as ""being intellectually molested"" ""waste of time"", etc. This book (I have a hard time calling it that) is like a high school term paper where you were asked to turn in X pages. The margins are so wide that this could have been printed at 3""x4"" to fill a page rather than 6x9. Even if it included some useful facts, it wouldn't be worth $20. Then you read it and realize its nothing but a bunch of filler positioned as a line extension book from a well known author who has tarnished his ""brand equity"" with this poor excuse of a book. Very sad. I am a consumer advocate and have been in the business for 30+ years having read and written books on the subject. At least with books like The Ultimate Question, there is something pragmatic an organization can use."
1,There is nothing revolutionary in this book,"This book is a waste of money and time (even though it only takes 1-2 hours to read this book). It is amazing to me that Ken Blanchard could charge $ for a book that is based on common sense and could be summarized in one page without losing any content. The premise of the book is that there are three ""secrets"" to customer services which are decide what you want, find out what your customers want and deliver the vision plus one percent. All the book is saying is that a business should have a vision of what it wants to accomplish, talk to its customers to ensure that this vision is aligned to customer expectations, and then deliver the vision consistently while always looking to improve (plus one). There are a few fictional examples of businesses that have excellent customer service but definitely not much depth at all."
5,Even For the Novice,Read the book. Absorb it and use the ideas - You will move forward in your work. It will change the way you view your workplace. It will change the way you do business. It will change your expectations. This one is NOT a keeper. It is to share. If the world worked this way more often... we'd all be happier.
4,"Good Message, Easy Read","Like many of Blanchard's books, Raving Fans was an extremely quick and easy read. The strategies he highlights seem like common sense, but it gives you a chance to reflect on them in your own business. I can't believe that there is anyone who wouldn't benefit from the guided self-reflection that this parable offers."
5,Loyal Customers are Your Best Asset,"Ken Blanchard is a master at teaching a concept in a fun way. This parable stresses the importance of uncompromised customer service. When customers are treated exceptionally well not only will they return, but they will bring their friends. Price is no longer a factor when deciding to buy. This book gets you thinking about how you can improve your business.Push Button Investing in Real EstateRon Draluck, author of Push Button Investing in Real Estate"
2,"Basic points, ridiculous story.","The three ""secrets"" for creating Raving Fans that this book discusses are very basic principles. Of course, in today's society, customer service has been flushed down the drain and I know many companies who need to have these basic principles shoved down their throat. However, the storyline in this book completely takes away from these principles. I understand the authors were attempting to make it more interesting, and I could even deal with the ""Fairy Godmother"" part of the story, but the companies used to illustrate ""raving fan service"" are completely illogical, and I feel that this really took away from the basic customer service principles that the book conveys."
1,Painfully poor writing about an important topic.,"Beware. The thesis is excellent, but the ""Readers Digest""-style writing is extremely lightweight and annoying. This is a fluffy, motivational ""parable"" about becoming customer focused. It offers imaginary examples of how to please customers without any actual advice on how to implement these types of ideas in real-world situations.If you're interested in improving your customer service and customer focus, look for something more substantial than this little book. If you're just looking to feel good about improving customer service and don't have a long attention span, this is your book."
1,Very high fluff to content ratio,"The useful pieces of this book (there is a tiny bit of good content in there) fit into ten bullet points or less.This is 130 pages of pure fluff - a story about a fairy god mother, playing golf, and time travel (I am not making any of that up, those truly are significant elements of the book).Even the 130 pages is a stretch with the font so large and the margins so massive I felt like I was reading a book written for children (the fairy god mother bit didn't help either).Business books often are pretty fluffy, this one is exceptionally so.Is creating raving fans important? Absolutely, but you do not need this book - just make a guess at what a raving fan is and you will have saved yourself 40 minutes of reading and be just as informed."
4,Still Good After all These Years,"I read this book many years ago, but a current Client asked me to re-read it prior to speaking in their organization as they are using its language and premises. I'm glad I did.It is a business fable, in traditional Blanchard style that tells story that is good enough to keep you engaged to lead and remember through repetition the keys points to creating ""raving fans."" While it may not be the best story of the books in this genre, it does illuminate important factors about doing more that satisfying Customers, but rather turning them into fans - a bar much higher than ""satisfaction.""Written in 1993, the subtitle is ""A Revolutionary Approach to Customer Service."" While I'm not sure it is revolutionary 12 years later, it is still worth reading. Consider this a great primer for Customer Service or a great book to encourage many to read because it is short and assessable even to those who don't read much."
2,Fictional Management,"The book starts off on a positive note. The author notes the modern generalization that good service in any business is no longer expected. Then, it takes a turn for the worse. The rediculous examples are insulting to anyone with an IQ above 100.The pervasive concepts contradict the work of Michael Porter on generic business strategies. You simply cannot be the service and quality leader and also be the cost leader. The worst example is the gas station where they will clean your windows, check your fluids, and generate small talk. All of this while maintaining a lower labor cost than the self serve station down the street. I know one of them actually owned service stations with a similar model in Canada, but I suspect other factors were in force.I don't think it's worth the time reading it."
5,A quick read towards better service,"I was given this book several years ago and read it a few times. I gave it to a client and have missed my copy so I will be buying another copy. Sure, the examples such as the service station and grocery store scenarios are simplistic and may be unrealistic, but they make you think about how you could improve your business. I have conducted my business on the principles in the book and I see the positive growth. Every business should have this book and make it available to every employee."
4,"Some good ideas, timeless","I was a little unsure of the ""parable"" style of it, it just came across as a little hokey to me. However, the ideas are solid and the examples very interesting. I was able to take some notes and actually use them in our recent staff meeting. It was worth the price, we actually got some good ideas out of it."
5,One of the best little books on Customer Service,"'Raving Fans: A Revolutionary Approach to Customer Service' is a book that I discovered referenced in several other books that I've been reading. In each other book, little was said other than a quote here or there. But noticing the book's presence, I purchased it and am glad I did.The book is written like a goofy fairy-tale--but you understand the gimmick and it helps you read the book quickly, makes memorable the lessons, and enables you to easily reference the points it is making.In a couple weeks, I will be leading a retreat on church membership assimilation as part of my doctoral dissertation and plan to use this book as a catalyst in discussing quality customer service from a guest's perspective.I whole-heartedly recommend this book. It says what other books take hundreds of pages to say in just a few pages, and you can pick up this book for just a penny from a host of used book sellers (although it is definitely worth its retail price)."
2,Too Involved to Learn Easily,"This is a somewhat clinical approach to what should be a really warm and personal subject. The author has a tendency to go on and on, burying us with minutia that we don't really need unless we are involved in massage professionally.Offputting for the novice, hobyist or hedonist; might work better for the professional-level massage practitioner."
4,Very Good for Beginners,I throughly enjoyed this book as it laid down the basic rules of massage and was quite informative. It also creates an awareness of different forms of massage and has lead me to taking on massage therapy as a profession.
4,Pursuing an Intimacy With God That Results in Humility,"C. J. Mahaney in ""Humility: True Greatness"" compares the physical check up of a physician with the need for a spiritual check up of the same nature. He wields the surgeon's scalpel to the soul of man with his piercing questions for self evaluation.The Book is divided into three parts. In part one Mahaney discusses the promise of humility and the peril of pride. In part two he redefines greatness and shows how greatness can be demonstrated. Part three deals with the pursuit of humility, the importance of focus, evidences of grace, correction,responding to trials, and leaving a legacy.This is a book for pastors, church leaders, and individual Christians. It is thought provoking, hard hitting, yet sensitive while pursuing an intimacy with God that produces humility. This is an excellent book for devotional reading and for frequent future reference."
5,ouch,"this is a great study of what I am not... ie humble... Yes, I agree with the entire premise, but I still would have preferred being comfortably ignorant of my arrogance and spiritual pride... yes, the cross is the only solution, and the disciplines suggested are simple, but to do them means that I would have to actually change...I guess that was the point...or the other point that it is not actually about me."
1,Must read review before buying,Be sure to check out the author's background in the links below. Do you really want to support Mahaney by buying his books? Do the works below suggest he would have anything worth reading?[...][...]
5,A much needed book for this time!,"This book is a hard one to read. But if your really up to the challenge of humility, I fully recommend this book."
4,Seeking books that make my life better,"This book has been recommended by many people of many faiths and walks of life. I found it to be a little bit over my head, but I think the principles are something that I should study over time."
5,Just started it and Chapter 1 was worth the price of the book.,I believe the Bible is more than the inspired word of God. I believe that it is a great pathway to a happy life. Mahaney has captured a major theme all of us struggle with in our lives and he has helped me see a different paradigm in just Chapter 1. This book is a must read for anyone.One side note - none of us are perfect. We must remember that. Only God is perfect. Chapter 1 helps us understand how that fits into the Protestant theology.
5,A book on my read often list,"Most books I will only read once, but there are a few books that are worth reading once every year or every couple of years - Humility: True Greatness is one of those books that I need to reread often.- It focuses on one of the key character traits of a Christ follower- It is biblical- It focuses on the cross- It is practical- It is an easy read, even though some of what is written is hard to hear- It is a quick readEven if you have read Andrew Murray's Humility, this book is still worth purchasing. It is easier to read and more practical than Murray's book. The Prideful Soul's Guide to Humility is also a great book on humility and that book and Humility: True Greatness are both different enough that I would recommend owning both."
4,Great Challenge,"When I finished this book in Spring '06, I immediately said to myself that I should read it every month for the rest of my life. I can't hold myself to that, of course, but the book issues that strong a challenge to my pride. By the end of the year I had taught the book to others, thus reading it again, and we all felt duly convicted and ignited by it. I am training myself to say daily, ""Lord, I need You,"" and really mean it. Thanks, CJ, for getting my focus in the right place again."
4,Good Classic book,"I bought this book to read to my children ages 11 & 12. We have been watching the first season of the Walton's on DVD. I stopped after a few paragraphs, because it seemed a little too ""adult content"" for them as he was talking about drinking and smoking as being OK. Doesn't seem to have the same ""family"" feeling as the show. For adult readers it is a good book, but one should not assume that even though it is the basis for the Walton's that it has the same message."
5,all TG Shepperd songs,I have searched forever for TG Shepperd and where he went since 1980. I loved him then and intend to buy all his albums eventually. His voice simply makes me melt. Thanks so much for answering my prayers....
3,"Good Story, But Not the Right Story","This story, though a very good read that I'm glad to have in my collection, is NOT ""Arsene Lupin Vs. Herlock Sholmes,"" a book which supposedly contains ""The Blonde Lady"" and ""The Jewish Lamp"" stories. That's the only reason it's not getting five stars in my review.Now, I'm not an expert on Arsene Lupin translations, but I definitely realized that something was wrong when I finished the book without once seeing the character of Herlock Sholmes (or Homelock Shears or whatever Sherlock Holmes is called by LeBlanc) introduced.So, if you're just looking for another Lupin story to add to your bookshelf, I very much recommend this book. However, if you are specifically looking for ""Arsene Lupin vs. Herlock Sholmes,"" then look elsewhere."
5,Fantastic.,"Honestly, I fell in love with the Japanese animated hero, Lupin III, way before I knew the character was based on a much older character. As soon as I found out, I searched long and hard for any of the Arsene Lupin books.After reading this, it's easy to see why it influenced Monkey Punch so easily. It's a fantastic story! Clever and fun to read.I absolutly love Ganimard. It's not hard to see...Zenigata, the inspector who chased the cartoon Lupin III was my favorite character there, too. Heh..."
5,Great Earrings,The earrings are beautiful. They were packed well and I was delighted to get them so fast. (less than 7 days). I would recommend this company to everyone.
1,Worthless,"The only reason I bought these stickers was because I was about $1 short of getting free shipping. Even with this in mind, these stickers suck, plain and simple. I mean, it's not even a paperback as described. It's like three pages of sort of heavy paper with a handful of stickers. Unfortunately, ""no stars"" is not an option, otherwise I would have awarded these stickers nothing."
5,Standard Reformed Theology Text,"This text is still the standard systematic theology text for those from the Reformed tradition. Having lasted as the preeminent textbook on systematics for decades, professor Berkhof's work is still unsurpassed in clarity and approachability. As a pastor, I consult this book regularly for doctrinal preaching and recently acquired a copy for our church's library. Readers both new and well-versed in Reformed dogmatics will find this text unsurpassed as a survey of theology proper, ecclesiology, christology, eschatology and other primary foci of biblical doctrine."
5,Classic Systematic Theology Text,I borrowed this systematic theology text printed in 1957 by Banner of Truth from one of my friends and I read it with my great hunger. After one week I managed to place an order for this book with Amazon at a greatly reduced price(22 US Dollar). I think it is one of the best classic theology texts that I ever found. I like his sincere and candid explanations especially on his Armillennium point of view that I also believe. Highly recommend.
2,5 Star Content; 2 Star Publishing,"Berkhof was the sine qua non of Reformed systematics texts for generations of American seminary students, pastors and theologians. He will still reward a close reading and sharpen the mind. The two stars are for the publisher, NOT THE CONTENT. Shame on Eerdmans! The production of this edition is a sloppy, careless bit of work not worthy of the memory of Louis Berkhof. Seminary students and pastors should consider the Banner of Truth edition instead: http://www.banneroftruth.org/pages/item_detail.php?4381"
4,BERKOF'S SYSTEMATIC THEOLOGY,BOOK IS BEING USED IN SYSTEMATIC THEOLOGY COURSE AT GRAHAM BIBLE COLLEGE. GOOD RESOURCE FOR REFORMED VIEW OF THEOLOGY. HAVE GAINED GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE REFORMED VIEW PARTICULARLY IN THE FIELD OF SOTERIOLOGY.
3,"Too Much ""Good Stuff""","Nice hodgepodge of '80s rock (U2, Winwood), pop (Frankie Goes to Hollywood) and reggae (Bob Marley, mixed up with a s---load of disco-fied drivel.Highlights: ""All Right Now"" by Free, ""Israelites"" by Desmond Dekker, ""Paper Sun"" by Traffic, ""Harder They Come"" by Jimmy Cliff and Fairport Convention's Cajun take on Dylan's ""If You Gotta Go, Go Now."" The take of Bob Marley's ""No Woman, No Cry"" is his excellent in-concert version from ""Live.""Maybe this should have been a single disc set."
3,"Too Much ""Good Stuff""","Nice hodgepodge of '80s rock (U2, Winwood), pop (Frankie Goes to Hollywood) and reggae (Bob Marley, mixed up with a s---load of disco-fied drivel.Highlights: ""All Right Now"" by Free, ""Israelites"" by Desmond Dekker, ""Paper Sun"" by Traffic, ""Harder They Come"" by Jimmy Cliff and Fairport Convention's Cajun take on Dylan's ""If You Gotta Go, Go Now.""Maybe this should have been a single disc set."
3,hit-biased,"Too many commercial 80s tracks, and not enough classic material, makes this compilation sound dated. At least they had the sense to include My Boy Lollipop!"
5,Fun to read!,My daughter and I love this book. My mom or someone must have read it to me when I was little too because I can remember the sing-songy-ness about it. :) A fun read for all ages. I highly recommend this book for any young reader's collection.
4,As good as the movie!,"I wont say that you have to see the movie to enjoy this, but it sure helps. They really work well together. Alot of the tracks are from the Swanky Modes, I believe a ficticious group from the movie that sound like James Brown. Those are real good. But the Devo and King Kotton songs are hysterical. Again, seeing the movie makes this 5 times better. Fishbone adds a funky track from their ""Truth And Soul"" album too. My only complaint is nothing from ""The Blender Children"". Now if you gotta have ""Mr. MX7"" you'll have to hunt down the ""Lords Prayers II"" collection, by Lords Of The New Church. See and hear this movie. In a word, it's AWESOME!"
4,Excellent 1970s Etta,"Where James steamrolls over dozen covers like a force of nature - no matter who was associated with these songs previously,you are bound to forget them as this lady attacks them with immensely powerful voice & volcanic passion,often bringing finale to gospel-ish climax.Funkified ""Lovesick Blues"" is great fun and you can almost see James shaking the booty in the recording studio.Kiki Dee must have been floored when she heard what James did to her ""Sugar On The Floor"".Warning: ""Takin' It To The Limit"" might stop you dead in track.Producer Jerry Wexler should be proud."
5,At long last---released on CD!!!,"I had this LP in the 70's and it was stolen from me during college in 1984. It turned me on to Etta, whose work is marvelous. I've had these tunes in my head for 14 years and am ecstatic that this great collection has been reissued on CD. ""I would rather be a blind girl/than to see you walk away"" --can't wait to get this CD!!!"
4,Does NOT fit all strollers,"The functional dimensions (not the size of the bag it comes in!) of this product should be given - it does not fit the very popular Graco Quattro Tour. It is very sturdy and warm. I like everything about it except I needed it and it was too darn small! The canopy of my stroller and the adult cup holders and storage were in the way. Since the canopy does not detach, my toddler's short little legs were hanging out the bottom. Better for a small stroller and a small baby. I'm going to the bus stop twice a day to get my kids on and off, and I need something that WORKS, and will continue to work for AWHILE. Unless the manufacturer starts making this bigger, The potential length of use is short enough and limited enough by it's incompatibility issues that it is not worth the money. If it were bigger, it would be worth it. The reflective trim is great, it is pretty and durable, and warm."
4,Love it... Even though it didn't quite fit,"It's well made, stylish and keeps my little one protected from the elements. However, I can't give it 5 stars because it didn't fit my jogging type stroller at first. The opening wasn't big enough for my stroller's handle and it wouldn't go on all the way. After much pulling, I managed to get it somewhat over somewhat, but it left my son's feet exposed. I kept at it and after a few weeks of use, it had stretched enough that I was able to force it over (with a slight ripping sound). Now it works great, though I'm not sure how I'll get it back off."
5,Fanstastic Product,"Meguiar's Ultimate is a fantastic product. Each car I have used it on, looks brand new when I am done. It's so easy and fast to apply and the shine is awesome! I highly recommend this product!"
1,Do not ship this item,"I have used this product before and it is a very good product.So why the 1-star rating? This item ships with the sprayer already installed. Spray heads are NOT leak proof and should not be allowed to remain on its side or upside down. There is no way to insure that a package containing a liquid will remain upright during shipment.This item was placed inside a plastic bag which was not leak proof. The item and bag were then placed in a box with my other items and shipped to me. Two ounces of this product leaked out and onto my other items in the box.The proper way to package this item for shipment is to remove the spray head and replace it with a seal and a screw-on cap. The sealed bottle and the spray head can then be shipped with minimal risk of leakage. See the pictures I posted under the item picture.Will I continue to use this item? Yes, but I will purchase it locally."
3,OK detail spray but....,This is a decent detailer that is easy to find in stores easy to use but does not come close to Adams detail spray. I have a 08 BLACK Sierra truck that I detail twice a year so a good detail spray is a must. Adams just gives a deeper shine and works better on a hot surface.
3,"Ok quick detailer, nothing to write home about.","If you need an off the shelf QD, this is a decent choice, but there are better products available locally.Pros-You can find it anywhere-Almost foolproof to use-Smells niceCons-Doesn't add much shine-Sprayer is too miserly-Not a great value for the $If shopping locally, I'd go for Lucas Slick mist or the Duragloss QD. For mail order, you are much better off with FK425 or Optimum Instant Detailer."
4,"Product is awesome, bottle SUCKS","This quick spray is awesome. It works really well. It's great for keeping your car clean between washes.However it has 1 HUGE problem. The bottle it comes in is a total piece of CRAP. I have bought 2 of these, and both have leaked if you tilt the bottle sideways or upside down.So basically, when it arrives at your home, 1/4 of it is already gone because it spilled and leaked out during shipping.You are supposed to shake it before use, so a good amount leaks and spills out while you shake it.Finally, if you store it in the trunk of your car (for quick access) you can be sure all the rest of it will spill out in your trunk (happened to me).And it doesn't spill from the nozzle or anything. it spills out of the bottom of the sprayer where it connects to the bottle.The maguires quick detailer doesn't have this problem. I don't know how a company as big as maguires could have overlooked such a CRAPPY design in their bottle..."
4,"Well-written history, questionable view","This book deals with the Reconstruction period, 1865-77. Bowers is of the older school that found the Radical Republicans, led by Thaddeus Stevens and Charles Sumner, with their ideas of punishing the South for seceeding and forcing equality for blacks in the South, especially at the polls, were disastrous for the South. This view has been hotly debated; for a revisionist view see Stampp's ""The Era of Reconstruction."" Bowers, despite his controversial views, is an interesting historian: his style is personal and flamboyant. His emphasis is on tragedy, and his tone echoes that sentiment. To him Andrew Johnson was fighting the good fight of A. Lincoln and sought moderation in black suffrage and ease at allowing Southerners to become US citizens again; Stevens et. al. were evil monsters. An interesting book, nowhere dull."
1,Simply Racist Propaganda,"The Tragic Era was considered a legitimate text book during the Depression and for many years afterward. However its historical view is pro-confederate, racist, and totally propagandistic. In this book you will find the arguement that slaves were happy and treated well, that after the Civil War the evil Northerners raped and pillaged the South unmercifully for 12 years, and that the angelic white men of the South only became racially bigoted because it was forced on them by the uppity freed slaves. This piece of trash is on the same quality level as Mein Kampf. If you want a realistic exploration of the Reconstruction period read Kenneth M. Stampp's ""The Era of Reconstruction""."
4,TRACKS,"Track Listing1. Gunslinger Man2. I Want You Bad3. Stitch In Time, A4. Light Gets In The Way, The5. Prairie Fire6. Baby's In Toyland7. Long Story Short8. Man Of Misery9. Harriet Tubman's Gonna Carry Me Home10. For The Rest Of My Days11. Spectacular Fall"
5,"Rossco, music fan",I bought this when it came out on vinyl and had to tape it several times because I kept wearing out the tapes. Great american roots rock for fans of The Bodeans or The Blasters.
4,Wish I had no reason to read this book...but...,"Reading ""From My Son's Garden"" is so much like the feelings and realities of what we have gone through and are still going through.How each one of us grief can be and is so different...but the real thing is ""WE ALL HURT"".The ""normal"" life is previous, never to be again. The ""new normal"" is something that ""is"" and we are having to accept it step by step because it is here.The love and memories will always be here to cherish."
1,Poor Quality,"When I received my gloves I noticed the Rt glove was sewn incorrectly. There was a 1 inch gap where the wrist band attaches to the leather. I notified the company, sent a couple pictures so they could see the problem and send out another pair. The reply was ""so sorry to hear that and will send another pair"". After three weeks nothing, e-mailed them again, the replay was ""I told the manufacture thought they took care of it, I Will call them again"", another three weeks nothing. Don't waste your time there are gloves just as nice in the stores you can buy, and since you can try them on you probably wont buy a defective pair, but if you do you can take them back. With these guys there is no recourse"
2,Vinicius never had such a weak voice!,"Imagine Minnie Mouse making a Brazilian demo record. That is what this resembles. Everything clicks here except Miho's shy, squeaky vocals. This CD is very uneven: the songs were written by geniuses, the instrumentals are lovely, and the vocals are just pitiful. What a waste of a good opportunity!"
4,Dropped right into the air box.,"This fit like a glove with no issues. It was a very easy install and the price was right. So far, so good."
3,A good starting analysis of the Lula Presidency.,"This book was written in 2002, so it is dated. It predicts how Lula will act in his presidency, and I think the authors did a good job of detailing what would happen. Lula maintained some of the policies of HC, but changed on the social front. His presidency was a contradiction. He talked of advancing the poor classes in Brazilian society, but kept some of the rich technocrats in office in the financial ministry. Overall, Brazil has a booming economy and their oil deals may signal the advancement of Brazil into the reaches of an India/China economic powerhouse.Lula certainly advanced Brazil during his years in office. I think he has done a better job than people such as Chavez, Morales, or the Sandinistas. Brazil will develop into a rich multi ethnic country and exert powerful influences in Central and South America. This is a good read on a complex subject."
3,Pricey but obligatory!!,"My husband loves ""The Art of Shaving"" products so I bought this for him for Christmas. I guess if you spend that much on shaving products you want a good razor. The razor is nice, but probably not worth the price (and this was one of the cheapest they sell)."
2,The Pimping Of Marvin's Legacy..,"..Continues with the ever growing number of redundant CD compilations.This 'Love Songs' collection joins another 'Love Songs' CD, which was released by Motown/Universal, and also recently 'Marvin's Love Songs-Duets' was also released by the same company.You would be a fool to buy 3 Marvin compilations every year.What's next, Marvin's Greatest Dance Tracks ???I gave the CD 2 stars just because it's Marvin Gaye, but the greedy record companies can jump off a tall bridge!!Forget about it & save your money!"
2,Great product if you DON'T use it,"The idea is great, but from daily use the nylon surrounding the metal frame has worn out, the metal frame whipped out and almost struck my son, therefore making the product defective.If you have this product, I highly recommend figuring out a way to reinforce the nylon around the frame with something that will withstand daily use of folding and unfolding.I will NOT buy again and I would NOT recommend to a friend."
4,this is nuts,my g'son likes it...a little hard to figure out how to refold but I'm working on it. three more words
2,Cumbersome,"Did not like it....it does not stay up easily and once you get it out of the bag, it is hard to get back in. The footprint of the product is not deep so when you kick even the smallest of goals, it falls over. Not happy. I returned it for a Pugg."
3,Pops up easily.....but......,"Santa brought this gift to our 4 year old for Christmas. It comes in a storage bag with strap. It pops up easily and there's not to much difficulty in putting the poles in for support. It also comes with stakes to keep the net in one place, however, I cannot figure out how to ""twist"" the net back into a circle to place it back into the storage bag. There were no instructions with the net.I have contacted Franklin Sports to see if they can help me with this problem. To date, I have not heard back from them but if I do, I will be sure to let you know what happened.So my suggestion is that unless you have a place to keep the net when not in use, since it can't be closed and leaving it outdoors will surely ruin it, buy something else."
4,"Very happy, good buy","Bought this for my 4-year-old, really likes it and it's holding up well, even when not used for intended purpose. Much better price than other brands I've seen out there."
5,Plum at his finest,"The recommended dose for many of Wodehouse's books is not more than once a year. The book, if the aforementioned cap is enforced, retains the juice for a longer time, somewhat similar to a half-chewed piece of gum regaining some flavor once kept aside for a few minutes.Big Money on the other hand seems to be a piece of Chicle that has an immense reservoir of spearmint (or your choice of toxic flavoring). I have read it, re-read it and then munched on it some more, multiple times a year, every year, without any appreciable loss of wit. This book is a gem, and along with other masterpieces like 'Joy in the Morning' the recommended dose can be safely exceeded, the only side-effect is an irritating, if not intolerable, pain in the sides from excessive mirth.If you have read Wodehouse before then be sure to get this, if you have not, then consider other books and then come back and buy this."
4,THE most comfortable shoe,"I danced for a little while and tried to wear LOTS of different shoes, but this was by far my favorite. The heel is just thick enough to walk around in all night with no fear of falling, but not look too chunky. These lasted me forever and that was using the gap between the heel and sole for climbing the pole sometimes when I got lazy. Great shoe at a good price."
4,"More Gerhard, but not enough","Ed Gerhard is an artisan, a musical craftsman. He takes his work very seriously without seeming to take himself as seriously. This CD extends upwards and out from his earlier works; the roots of the outstanding ""Night Birds"" are evident here. There is the common mistaken assumption that instumental guitar music is all the same, the artists and compositions blending together, one indistiguishable from another. With ""Luna"", the listener cannot mistake Gerhard's unique musical signature.His compositions are passionate, intelligent, introspective, as is his playing. One does not get the sense that Gerhard is ""trying"" or emulating. This is beautifully, lovingly crafted music which merits an objective listen. One hopes for Gerhard that he might in time find the same following, success and longevity of Kottke."
2,There must be a better book out there,The only reason I got A's in Gen. Chemistry 1& 2 is because I had a FANTASTIC teacher (thank you Franois). This book makes Chemistry harder to understand than it should be. I recommend this book to insomniacs who like to get headaches!
5,The best.,"I definitely love to learn, but it's always a pain when the book is poorly written, this is not the case with The Central Science by Theodore Brown. I thank you and your team for writing an awesome book that students can understand. I will definitely recommend this book, and I actually want to convince the chemistry dept. at my school to change their textbook ;) Simply the best, thanks!edit: I have been reading many of the comments left by other users saying this book is not for beginners ... and it's true. I suggest you take the class seriously and read this book thoroughly and do all the red exercises, especially the additional and integrative exercises. If you can do these exercises, I promise you'll do fine."
3,"good text, but not up to current standards...","this is a very informative texts... but the drawings and the graphics are not up to current standards.... and also the pages rip easily and the textbook wears out fast (really fast!!!)...i bought this after I bought my class textbook (one by Raymond Chang).. i found them to both to be good... chang's isn't that drawn out (better for me, since I knew a lot of stuff from highschool) and it lasts much longer... but this text started from the very basic chemistry... in other words.. this texts assumes u knew nothing about chemistry before u started it."
4,Chemistry: The Cantral Science (Ninth Edition),This is an advanced high school chemistry book which covers all the main aspects of the science. Emphasis is on useful applications of chemistry and up to date fact sand experiments. Recommended for high school juniors and seniors.
5,"Clean, clear and simple","This video is offers the best clean, clear and simple instructions for anyone just getting into yoga. It allows the first time practitioner a chance to explore yoga in a safe and gentle way. The instructions are clear and simple to follow. I love the breathing exercises in the beginning, which anyone can incorporate not only in their daily practice but in their everyday lives."
3,"Nice, and very cute...","This dog is very sweet, and a perfect recreation of a sheltie! However, it sheds alot, and the fibers are not as soft as I would have like. It's not the BEST one for snuggling up next to, but it is still pretty soft. I would recommend this dog to you if you want a nice little Sheltie, but if you want a softer animal for little kids in the bed, get a fluffier one."
1,Enjoy it while it lasts,"I have owned two of these units, both brand new. The first one lasted about 2 years and then started overheating. So I chalked it up to overuse an bought a second one. This one was working fine for about a year and then stopped acquiring the satellite signal. No bars. The ID screen is blank. Like it forgot who it was.Is there a way to reset these things or re-enter the ID?Buyer beware. These units are a waste of money. And to add insult to injury, Sirius charges you to move the service to a replacement unit."
3,Defect No Doubt,"I had the Calypos for a year and a half with absolutely no problems. I took it from car to boombox every day. It would be on for 12+ hours a day. Then nothing! The unit would only display the logo, no channels, no music. I'm trying to get it fixed, but who knows. I love Sirius, not sure I'd buy another Clarion product through."
5,Excellent Unit,"After spending a year with a ""POS"" Blaupunkt Sirius receiver that couldn't pick up a signal in the middle of the prairie, I found this great little unit. Imagine, I can actually see the display in the daylight! It doesn't cut out when I drive under a tree, the brightness can be adjusted to not blind me at night with a Cyclops like beam---there is an electronics GOD!!!!!!!"
2,Poor quality and poor methodology,"I am actually returning the tapes. I thought the sound quality was poor and the methodology was equally poor. There is little repetition and though the speaker requests that the listener repeat phrases, little time is given to repeat the phrases. The tapes spend alot of time on sentences and not on the actual words that make up the sentence. These tapes might be more appropriate for advanced speakers wanting to polish their skills but I would not recommend them for beginners."
1,Repetitive and Rambling,"Very disappointing. They are tapes --I can play them again! Tape 4 contains about 2 minutes of new material and is a re-hash of tapes 1-3, which are all pretty much the same. The entire 8-hour series could go on one cassette."
1,I need to return these,The so called spanish tapes to learn in your car or home tapes was awlful as the sound would only come across here or there and when it did they were warped...these apparently have been damaged horribly and I am very unsatisfied. How do I get my money back and how do I return these tapes
2,Good with the Bad,"I'm on my second micro spin now. I liked the first enough to try a second even though that first one broke internally such that you could not move the arm at all. After a season of light duty (lunchbreaks in a pond near work), the arm developed a stiff spot in it's rotation. I took it apart to grease the worm gear, but alas, the material had galled. I was otherwise pleased with the size, price, and performance of these reels. However, after two have failed, I will now look elsewhere for a micro sized spinning reel."
4,Nice small reel,"So far so good. I caught a nice rainbow on my first cast! This is a great little reel if you like to fish with light line. I typically use 2# test, and this reel holds plenty of it. Good smooth retrieve and casting action. There is no ""trigger"" on these small reels, so if you're used to that, it may take some getting used to. Overall very pleased with the purchase."
5,great tea,Taylors of Harrogate Green Tea with Jasmine is some of the most divine tea in the world. Their other teas are good too.
5,Wonderful Green Tea!,I went to a party and was served this tea. I begged for some extra tea bags to take home and immediately placed an order. Many green teas taste like grass to me - this smells and tastes delightful.
5,wonderful flavor,"Don't have any other tea in the house since started using Taylors of Harrogate green tea with jasmine. Flavor is wonderful, either hot or cold."
5,Thanks for offering this great green tea,"Where I live, I know of no stores that carry this tasty, healthy drink. I received my order in a timely fashion in great condition at a fair price. Thanks!"
4,Very helpful.,"Dr. Bernstein is becoming a prolific writer. This helpful assistance for those studying The Fountainhead will not dissapoint. I could've used this more than twenty years ago, when first reading that wonderful novel. Be glad it's available for you today."
5,Everything You Need,This has everything you need to pass a test or write a paper on this arduously long novel. I could even sound somewhat intelligent during group discussion just having read these Cliff Notes. Good buy!
2,The Adventure of Buyer Beware,"The stories printed in the Academy edition differ from those in the Pinnacle edition. The Pinnacle edition contains: Shaft of Death, Defeated Doctor, Surrey Sadist, and Missing Student. While this Academy edition contains: Shaft of Death, Defeated Doctor, Murder at the Zoo, and the Frightened Governess. In Pinnacle editions, Murder at the Zoo and the Frightened Governess are in #11 The Uncollected Cases of Solar Pons.So Buyer Beware of Overlap between Pinnacle and Academy editions.**"
3,Not Much New Here,"Given Fest's reputation as a -- or even the -- leading German historian of the Nazi period, I found the book somewhat disappointing. Its sketchy narrative really adds nothing new to our understanding of the bunker period. It is best seen as a very brief introduction to the terminal period of the Third Reich and some of its more significant figures, but that is about the extent of its contribution. As others have noted, there are many far superior books available for those with an interest in this topic."
3,Perpetuates a myth,"Mr. Fest, while a good writer, still perpetuates the myth of Hitler's suicide despite the admission of modern historians that the Russians did not find Hitler's body. Instead of at least exploring the strong evidence that Hitler escaped Berlin on April 22, 1945,it is explained, that there were no corpses since they burned to ""ash flakes"".This is physically impossible.It seems, Trevor-Roper could have been wrong after all."
2,"Brief, Dry and Disappointing","Mr. Fest is a competent writer, but his account here is dry, brief and for those with prior knowledge of the facts, this book is very disappointing.For a period with such plots and subplots this book is surprisingly colorless.For an excellent book on a decisive turning point in Third Reich history, I most warmly recommended `Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege: 1942-1943'By Antony Beevor."
3,Spicy journalistic report,"Inside Hitler's Bunker is a good introduction to the final days of the Second World War from the Nazi perspective - a horrific denoument to a great crisis in world history as Hitler and his cohorts, realising defeat was inveitable, still pursued a grand Wagnerian ending until the last. Berlin was in ruins, thousands were dying by the day, the Red Army were marauding in from the East. And Hitler, a 'cake gobbling wreck', shattered by events, bloodily ended it all along with his wife.This is a short, journalistic history, mainly from secondary sources, with a good deal of speculative rumination. It is not a deep scholarly book. It will appeal as an introduction to the topic, interspersed with some interesting pictures of the war ravaged Berlin, and inside the Bunker itself."
2,Extremely short.... more like an essay...,"This book will never make you feel the sensation of impending doom that you testify while watching the recent German movie based in this book. The book is very short, it's has no intention of going deep into every character's psyche. It's not a bad book at all, but it's uninteresting."
2,This book didn't need to written.,"James O'Donnell's ""Bunker"" is the authoritative history of the Fuhrerbunker. Even Mr. Fest acknowledges that in his Bibliography notes. ""Inside Hitler's Bunker"" is cursory, superficial and unoriginal and it escapes me that there can be any reason this book was written except to make a quick buck off of unwary readers. It's a joke. Avoid it at all costs."
3,Good companion to the movie Downfall,"I decided to read this book after seeing the movie ""Downfall"" at a local art-house theater. Fest tells the story of the last day's of Hitler as he and his most loyal officers waited inside his bunker while the Allies were invading Germany. I didn't know much about this event before other than that Hitler committed suicide inside a bunker but now I have a better understanding of what actually happened. The book is short and easy to read and is recommended for casual readers of history."
3,An interesting entry in the tall ships genre...,"In this, the first book of his series, Dan Parkinson introduces Patrick Dalton, junior officer in the Royal Navy during the American Revolution. Fans of Kent, O'Brian, and Pope will not find the style and fluid writing presented by them present in this book. Parkinson does show a good story sense, presents an interesting scenario, and does a good enough job with his main characters to make it worth reading. I'll be interested to see if the successors in this series improve on this volume's weak points in writing style, and are able to build on its interesting story layout."
4,Helpful advice for the uninitiated and marketing-challenged,"It's unfortunate Bly's book is out of print because it's one every small business owner could benefit from. I have a home-based business as a Freelance Marketing Writer and one of the most popular services I offer clients is Targeted Public Relations. With a modicum of decent writing skills and this book, you can do it, too. Public relations can be the secret key to small business success. If you order this book, I assure you it will be worth the wait."
5,The folk,"This CD's two discs contain some of the originators of American folk music. There is a bit of scratchy sound on a few cuts because of age and the recording methods, but the music is surprisingly fresh and clear. You will have a master anthology by adding these two discs to your collection. They range from Woody Guthrie to Lead Belly, Mississippi John Hurt, John McCutcheon and Pierre Bensusan. It's a marvelous set with unexpectedly good sound quality and a good variety of the choice of songs. Each artist has one song and there is a booklet describing the music and artist.Those who appreciate folk music, its' part in history, Americana or just a pleasant listening experience would enjoy this selection."
3,PRE-SCHOOL TEACHER,The illustrations are unique and quit original there is a little poem in the beginning of the book A dedication to her cat after reading it I thought the book would flow in that context and it didn't overall a good book.
4,Mostly Classic...,"Yes it's a great starter's set..! But I wonder why so many of his great movies are not in boxed sets yet?!! This box set has 2 of his eighties and 2 of early ninties but there are so much good movies of his that need to be in a set as well.If you love Al Pacino, you'll love buying his movies. And this box set happens to be a good start but don't think that it's enough there's so much left such as Heat and Devil's Advocate which are the MASTER PIECES of his acting career!So it is good but not enough... something else, the DVD's included in this set are poor in extra's. It seems we can't have it all :-)"
3,Decent pocket meter; but does not have the bar graph as advertised,"I'm not sure if it was in the listing for this meter or elsewhere that I saw that it had a bar graph display for a quick analog view of transients, but the unit I received definately doesn't have this bar graph. I'm still looking for the smallest available DMM with an analog bar graph."
4,Gear Daddies - Let's Go Scare Al,Another very nice album from the Gear Daddies.A must have if you like them
4,Who's Your Daddie?,"I bought this album, yes the vinyl stuff we used to listen to in the olden days, back in 1988. I never shared it with anyone because it wasn't cool to like anything that sounded like roots rock or dare I say country. However, Cut Me Off and Statue of Jesus were just too good to ignore. The hilarious Drank So Much (Just Feel Stupid) got played the most. Blues Mary still gets a lot on play on my iPod. I had to record from the vinyl version onto my computer to get it but it was worth the hassle.The closest comparison I have is to the great band the Bottle Rockets. You will enjoy their music, just get it."
5,Country Rock,One of the best country rock albums I have ever heard. Deep lyrics and smooth melodies make this a must have for any contemporary rock/country lover to own.
4,ADT Sales Manager,"""I find this book to be very inspiring,it makes you question yourself and what you think is important. I can't wait to check out Jack's next book!"""
4,Join The Hunt,"What a great read! Mr. Needham takes readers on a fast-paced, unforgettable journey filled with emotion, self-awareness, and hope."
2,Disappointing and thin,"This book was a disappointment. I got thrown into an XML/SOAP project and had to get up to speed in short order. After struggling on my own for a while I bought this book hoping it would have lots of meat on actually using SOAP::Lite, but it had pretty thin coverage.I did like the big-picture overview of the various technologies, but it was not very helpful in writing an actual SOAP client to talk to a third party's SOAP server. Considering that the author of SOAP::Lite also wrote this book, it seems to me that there could have been a whole chapter on SOAP::Lite from the client view.This will stay on my shelf as a reference, but for getting up to speed rapidly on actually writing a SOAP client, it was a bust."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This book is a good candidate for the city dump. This, in my experience, the book is one of the worst O'Reilly books and should have never been published! Sloppy examples riddled with errors. Why, the eratta page on the O'Reilly web site appears to be written by a reader. The ony correction I found in the ""Official"" errata was a mis-spelled author name. I'm setting fire to my copy as soon as I submit this review!"
2,It should have focused on SOAP.,"Hi I'm the one who wants to learn how to build cool apps with SOAP. To be honest, this book is not that practical. It certainly explains the overview, but in terms of developing a real application, I don't think this is useful.It should have focused on only 1.) what is SOAP, 2.) how it works 3.) how to write code.It tries to cover more broad, vague topic Web Services, which is more or less overview, as it is not ready for prime time.How to use SOAP API should be not that difficult to understand, but what each SOAP envelope's xml tag syntax means are most important to me. It's so complex and this book doesn't explain clearly, which makes this book less valuable.Looking forward to next improved edition."
2,Wait For A Collecion of Covers,"Erin McKeown has a beautiful voice, amongst the best that I have ever heard. I saw her live and her voice reminded me of Billy Holiday's. She plays great music on a variety of instruments. Unfortunately, she's a terrible lyricist.Consider the following (from her song ""Softly, Moses""):""Lonely in the dark/Images creep past/Bright pink, purple, green /Blue and black/Despair oh holy day/We cross down sorrow's Way""Angst-ridden 14-year-old girls write better stuff than this. It's a shame, because the songs are impeccable acoustically. If McKeown did an album of other people's songs, I would probably buy it immediately."
2,Not so fun,"I did not buy this miniatures to play Dreamblade but to play D&D. Well, this collection do not have many fun miniatures. Most are just... strange. If you want to buy dreamblade to play d&d, buy just the basic sets."
3,would be 5 stars with better soundtrack,"I bought this DVD because I have a two and a half year old at home and my wife is a huge M.E. fan (killed two birds with one stone). The artwork and story line were wonderful. Unfortunately you have to constantly adjust the volume (up - during parts where the characters are speaking) as the characters voices are constantly drowned out by the loud music.After watching it about ten times I still haven't understood half the words Impelstick says (especially in his spells). And if I didn't know Clement C. Moore's story before, I still would not, as you can barely hear Kevin Kline's narration (his voice is just above a whisper). Overall I was disappointed with this DVD. I don't know what it would cost them to redo the soundtrack, but it would be worth it to create a true Christmas classic."
5,Absolutely adorable!,"This is a wonderrful movie for little kids. It looks like a child's storybook of The Night Before Christmas magically brought to life, and the artwork is adorable. My six little grandchildren--ages 2-8--burst into giant smiles when the movie first began and never took their eyes off the screen.The kids were totally enchanted by the endearing little mouse who sets off across the snowy forest to save Christmas. And the storyline kept them enthralled. At one point in the movie, the little mouse is lost and scared, whereupon a little girl fairy appears and encourages him on through a song, ""Don't ever give up."" The kids instantly got the message and have been singing the song ever since!The movie is full of the joy and magic of Christmas. And for giving a child the dream of Christmas, it's a gem!"
2,Disappointed in the quality,"I'm a huge fan of Mary Engelbreit and her book ""The Night Before Christmas"", but I was really disappointed in this DVD. Most of the charm of her artwork is lost in the translation to computer graphics. The computer animation is stiff and robotic, the ""expanded"" story is cliche, the songs schmaltzy and unmemorable. I'm sure young children will still like it, but I would suggest instead buying the book and reading it to your kids. It'll be much more meaningful."
1,Not worth it,"This book is useless, that is unless every drug dealer and user establish these bogus terms as canon and memorize everything."
1,A literary disaster.,These four empty stars I'm appointing you are as transparent as your deceitful attempt to promote this poorly written collection of fabricated slang.
1,Fabricated,Alot of the slang in this book is completely fictional. Not worth the time or money. And who needs a drug slang book anyway?
1,Save your money,I wouldn't recommend this book as most of its content seems made up and badly written. Avoid this book and get your made-up drug slang on the web instead.
1,Disinformation is what this book is.,"A book who's entries look as if they were created from throwing scrabble tiles onto the floor and picking out what looks like words.If you're looking for a quick way to kill yourself, repeat some of the garbage in this book to your local gang's dealers, who will be quick to shoot you in the space in your head where your brains should be."
5,Amazing...,"I have to say that this is by far one of the best books I have read on drug paraphenilia slang, its incredible how this person has comprised the book from begginning to end and whats more amazing is the amount of research that took in order to comprise this masterful book. I didn't know alot of slangs for many of the drugs available on the market and now I have a constant knowledge and updated database. 5 Stars all the way!!!!"
4,Get the 2-CD set...,"Do yourself a favor and get the 2-cd set if you're a fan! If you're new to the cure, be aware that this was a record-company-picked list, and NOT what the band themselves would have chose (this is according to them, not my own speculation). But it's still got a lot of great songs on it... that second CD though, the acoustic versions, are like sitting in on a session with them. An absolute delight! That's what I love about them though, that no matter how huge of a success they are, we fans feel like part of a small on-line community, not faces in the crowd. Enjoy!"
1,wait just a second,"The cure has a pretty long career and have released two greatest hits collections before this, Galore and Staring at the Sea. This new greatest hits collection is really taking a few songs from the previous two greatest hits album and packing it as something new. This is not really a good way to get a good overview of the cure's career. Buy Galor and Staring at the Sea. It'll cost you more but it will be worth it though because you'll be able to hear the cure in its full form."
4,The Cure's Greatest hits,"Unlike some greatest hits album, this is a certifiable jewel. The classics keep coming at the listener from #1 until the end of the record. I'd rate this a 9/10 and have since purchased a second copy for my girl friend's car as well. I enjoyed this music the greatest when sipping on wine with the lights low and candles lit. A must buy for any Cure fan!"
1,why?,"How could they call it ""greatest hits"" if it doesn't include ""Hot, hot, hot"" or ""Pictures of you""?"
1,New Wave junk,"I bought this cause The Cure kept coming up in my conversations with people. Boy, does this music suck. I actually burst into laughter while listening to these songs. It is so ridiculous and gimicky that it's almost like a Cinderella or Poison album."
4,Know what it really is,"Okay, so if you approach this album as the 'contractual obligation' collection instead of G. Hits, you won't be so taken aback. As in ""intro"" to the cure, it contains a number of songs whose choice is slightly dubious, but it's not supposed to be the Cure's NIFTYEST Hits, just singles that have charted. Make an interesting gift, but the real gem is if you get the version with the acoustic renditions of all the songs on the album. That's why I bought it, and if you're looking for ""Acoustic Cure Album, with two new songs"", then this is worth purchasing. Even if ""Cut Here"" has The Cure sounding like a New Order cover band, hehe."
4,Awesome,"I like this CD. The only reason I bought the full album was for one song on it. I can't find it on any other album, so I just bought the whole thing. I like it a lot, but when I received it the CD case was cracked pretty bad. It's ok because there wasn't any damage to the actual CD. I just wish they would have packaged it more safely. Other than that, I like the CD and can't wait to play it in my car. :)"
5,Great band...,"Not only is The Cure one of the best bands but they also have a talented singer. Robert Smith has been out snice the 70s, and still is playing music to this day. He sounds the same, he looks the same. Any band that can stay play at his age must be very strong and a great musican."
3,Average,"There are some songs that do deserve to make the cut of greatest hits on that cd but tell me here where is ""The Kiss"" and ""The Hanging Garden"" tow ultimate deserving songs. Dissppointing over all"
3,Meatless chili without beans?,"this is a great CD if you're new to the Cure, heard their mainstream stuff on 80's radio, for example. But, they ARE one of those bands (and there aren't many) where the albums should really be taken as a whole to get a fuller, meatier picture. Still good, though. Would recommend."
2,Deja Vu for The Cure?,"Haven't we been here before...several times? The Cure, are without question, one of the most influential ""well-known"" bands of our time and I'm certainly not disputing their talent. In fact, I may own every Cure album produced. Which is exactly the problem with another 'greatest hits' offering. Staring At The Sea was a remarkable piece of work in every respect. Galore was a less-than-comparable followup but did include songs that needed to be released in greatest hits form.But we're not reviewing those albums, or The Cure's indisputable talent. We're reviewing a greatest hits compilation that has been played out (with the exception of the two, yes, count 'em, TWO, new tracks).If you're a fan of The Cure, you already own every song on this CD (ok...all but two). If you're just discovering The Cure, there are several more pertinent releases to acquaint you with this band's immeasureable gift to the world of music.Then again...I could be wrong."
3,"One way or the other, get the song ""Cut Here""","For a greatest hits collection, you are much better off getting ""Staring at the Sea"" and/or ""Galore"", depending on whether you like early Cure, later Cure or both. But the one thing you should not miss from this latest greatest hits package is the song ""Cut Here"". It is one of the most lovely songs the Cure has done in a long while, including some of Robert Smith's most personal and heartfelt lyrics. (It is about Billy MacKenzie; check wikipedia for more info.) Musically, the 6-string bass evokes the heyday of both the Cure and New Order. Don't miss out on this gem. Download that track or find a copy of the import cd single or get a used copy of ""Greatest Hits"" just for this song. You'll be glad you did."
3,The Cure's greatest hits,"Don't get me wrong, The Cure are probably one of my favorite bands of all time but this Greatest Hits collection to me is pretty skimpy. Like one of the previous reviewers said, The Cure were never a ""hits"" band. Plus it's impossible to pick 18 of their best songs to put on 1 CD. This CD does feature some of my favorite songs by them such as ""A Forest"", ""The Walk"", ""Lovecats"", ""In Between Days"", and ""Why Can't I Be You?"" but they have tons of way better songs than say ""Friday I'm In Love"". It does include 2 new songs ""Cut Here"" and ""Just Say Yes"". The former is really good but the latter is pretty bad (even worse than Round & Round & Round on WMS). To get a perfect introduction to The Cure, just pick up the 2 singles collections and try going for some albums too."
3,Not an immeadiate buy,"The Cure were hardly ever a ""hits"" band, which makes this CD a puzzler. By omitting a large amount of earlier material and both ""fascination Street"" and ""Pictures Of You,"" it pretty much rates as a misfire. Of the two new songs, ""Cut Here"" is the better of the two. But for a complete overview, you're probably just as well off picking up ""Staring at The Sea"" and ""Galore"" as a two pack.PS. I will say this, if you can find the double disc of this CD with the ""Acoustic Hits"" bonus, the rating jumps a star. The same 18 songs played in a much looser format, sounding almost like they were done on a single take."
4,You're all wrong,"This album isn't weak because it lacks the obvious greatest hits from the Cures' past. And it is by no means good because it contains more 'obscure' tracks, because these tracks really aren't obscure. Furthermore, the tracklist is in fact more poppy than earlier singles collections, countering the rebuttal to the criticism of this album that 'people don't like it because it's not mainstream-based and has more depth.' This album has little depth. This is an excellent collection altogether, and when it comes down to it you just have to decide which of the singles' cds has the songs you want. In all fairness, it's hard to pack 18 Cure songs on to a greatest hits album without there being complaints."
2,why?,The Greatest Hits is really pointless in the face of the perfectly perfect Staring At The Sea: The Singles 1979-1985 and it's companion Galore: The Singles 1986-1997. Get those two instead of this -- you get more Cure and less contractual filler.
3,"Past ,Past and did I say Future woops","I love the Cure and will go to the grave a die hard fan but this album let's the loyal posse down because it is the same as the last 3 or maybe 4 albums. The music keeps getting recycled. This group is running a record for the most greatest hits made. The only thing that refutes this statement is that there are 2 new songs at the end that pumps you up just to put you out again. This album is good for a person who stumbled on to The Cure and like the mainstream stuff. The raw,doom and gloom, emotional music that real cure fans demand was left on the Kiss Me Kiss Me Album.For a first time listener this would be a 5 star but for a regular its a 3 because we have rated this album under a different title before."
3,better to get the whole collection,This collection is poor... it doesn't give justice to Robert Smith and the cure gamma of music. It's better for you to save the money and buy complete albums of the cure...but that's just me..
2,Was this supposed to be some kind of holiday cash in?!,"This can't be a greatest hits CD. Not even close. Where in Gods green earth is Pictures of You, by far one of their best songs. If you want this go and get the Two CD version with the acoustic performances of the songs. This 1 CD version is pretty much useless. The new songs are not too bad but I am not convinced in getting this CD. I already have Galore and Staring At The Sea. This one is worth passing up."
3,what did you expect?!,"As a long-standing Cure fan, I have to say I was a bit disappointed, but, since I have most of this on album, I was more than happy to have a CD version. I don't know who Saffron is, but I hope the cat strangles her before she manages to get a contract."
5,Just my thoughts,"This album was my first introduction to The Cure, believe it or not. If you've never heard the band, this is a great place to start; if you have, I don't know what to tell you. I mean, just because you're reading this probably means you already listen to the band and own every song in this compilation anyway. But for me, I wouldn't be the same if it were not for songs like ""Lovecats,"" ""Just Like Heaven,"" and ""Friday I'm In Love."" They have all picked me up from the floor and made my spirits rise like no other music I've heard. That's all I can really say. I'm no authority with Robert Smith and his history, and I'm not pretending to be. I just want to say I love this album. I'll go now."
1,One word: disaster!,"What is the point of this greatest-hits CD? Pre-holiday cash-in? Contract fulfillment? Either way, this is a shabbily-assembled disc that will most-likely appeal to 16-year-olds who started their Cure collection with ""Disintegration."" How can you do a Cure collection while COMPLETELY ignore the ""Pornography"" LP, a fan's favorite and one of the best releases in their catalogue? And where's ""Killing an Arab"" and ""Jumping Someone Else's Train?"" I realize that some compilations will have to omit a favorite or two for space reasons, but this CD is an incomplete collection that's supposed to chronicle the 20-plus year history of one of pop's most enduring bands."
2,Not the Greatest Hits,"This really isn't worth much unless you can find the double-disc version that has a whole second cd with acoustic versions of all the songs on the greatest hits disc. It has a brief glance of old Cure (the only Cure that counts), the generic stuff from Disintegration/Wish/Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me, and some junk from Wild Mood Swings (by far the worst Cure release). If you're looking for a greatest hits to start off with to get to know the Cure go for Staring At the Sea, it's loaded with great old songs from Boys Don't Cry up to Head On the Door (pre-Disintegration unfortunately). If you're looking for a Cure greatest hits with newer stuff try finding Galore, actually, no, nevermind, don't get Galore, it has songs from Wild Mood Swings."
2,weak cash run,"Is Robert hurting for money? Seriously, this is nothing more than the past two singles collections (you know, the previous cash runs) smashed together. And trying to squeeze 13 albums down to one is impossible. Your better served just getting a standard Cure album, as their songs are better in context anyway. I recommend Disintegration or Faith."
4,The Quintessential Austin Experience,"This movie is, for better or worse, the movie that best describes Austin, Texas, one of the most interesting little cities /big towns in the USA. More than anywhere else in the country, Austin has developed a cult following as a city where young people can be young forever, waiting tables and drinking coffee and going to clubs until the day they go to that great coffee house in the sky. Watch the movie and you'll see why."
5,"My favorite film, not ""movie"", film","This is just like a man picking up a camera and following people around. IT'S AWESOME. Every actor in this film should get an Academy Award. This is top notch acting. You may think the acting is horrible, but think about it. They are acting like human beings, not a Mission Impossible man, or a Zorro, or a Bat man, or a teen in love with a girl. This is life, and it's hilarious."
2,Not playable in America,"There was no mention of REGION in the Amazon page, but when I tried to play it, it would not, looking at the dvd case I saw it is a REGION 2 disc. Disappointing as I am a Linklater fan, had to go out of my way to return it."
2,Painful to watch,My review is based on the first half of this movie because I was fortunate enough to fall asleep halfway through. In short this movie is a montage of people whom in real life I would either run away from or if it wasn't practical tell them to please shut up. I suppose people closer to the 'scene' would say I just don't get it and they're probably right but I don't want to. On the other hand if you like listening to people prattle on about Madonna's pap smear this may be your film.
3,Slacker,"Its a stoner film so it may lose you if your sober, but it does shine on a lot of conspiracy theories for you to argue or agree with. Dialog heavy little to no action so be warned."
4,One of the Best Indie Films of the 90's,"A movie that must truely be viewed to be an eclectic arristicrate, with a slacker mentality."
5,"The chain smokers, insomniac bible","I regret ""loaning"" this book to another slacker a few years back, who loaned it to yet another slacker, who drifted to the west coast with it et al...never saw it again. But had I kept it I would've memorized many of the passages (Like the UFO conspiricy rant!) - the book is the story behind the making of the brilliant movie, a story which is every bit as entertaining and thought-provoking as the movie itself! It's unfortuante, and a bit odd that the movie is no longer available at the worlds largest shopping mall, Amazon.com. After all, it WAS a watershed movie. Go figure."
1,Don't expect anything like 'Clerks',"I rented this movie after reading that Kevin Smith was inspired by it to shoot Clerks. I'm a big fan of the dialogue, characters and originality of Clerks, so I thought Slacker would be worth a look. Unfortunately, I could not relate to any of the characters and the dialogue, although original, was not funny or interesting. The only thing that impressed me was the directing."
1,I hated this movie,"First off let me say, I wish you could rank products with zero stars. Why I ate this movie... stupid kids, stupid theories, stupid movie, I hate the term slacker, and anyone who adheres to that philosophy."
3,Slacker slacks off,"Slacker is a good description of this supposedly ""deluxe"" version:Last I checked, a 1:33 aspect ratio was NOT widescreen (1:45 and 2:85 are). And 2.0 audio was NOT 5.1 or DTS stereo.And they want 32 bucks for THAT? Forget it!Hey, Criterion - you put this out in real widescreen and real 5.1 audio someday... and even then I still wouldn't pay more than 20 bucks."
1,"So, so bad","Have you ever been accosted by a complete stranger and forced to listen to his pet theories on government coverups?Have you ever been the only sober person in a room of stoners while they, ya know, wrestled with, like, life and $%#@?Do you have a know it all friend, like Cliff Clavin from Cheers, who actually knows almost nothing, but doesn't let it stop him from talking non-stop?Have you ever watched late night cable access shows?Did you enjoy any or all of these? if so, Slacker is for you. If not, don't even think about it...or most any Linklater movie with the exception of Dazed And Confused."
1,"""A collage of crap""","After wathcing this movie, I had trouble seeing linkletter's point in the harried lives of his characters. There wasn't any real plot and leaves the viewer wondering about the protagonists pyhrric victory. The movies self-defeating concept of bashing centralized buisness may make the audience question the director's motive: Is their a real message in this movie, or is Linkletter just complaining about his innability to succeed in the social world? ""Slacker"" is a poor attempt to blame society's problems on large industries. Maybe the Director should try observing his surroundings before turning on his camera."
5,If you like Ramen Noodles (or eat 'em anyway) you'll dig it.,Slacker.... Linklater's most 'indie' film to date is a flash phantasmagoria snapshot view into the lives of some very interesting characters who just happen to be the same people I stumbled about with during the first half of the 1990's. If EasyRider was the movie that defined the youth spirit of the 1960's well Slacker defines the early 1990's... or maybe more the young who were crawling out of the 80's pulling the rest of 'generation X' kicking and screaming from the MTV. Anyway... thats my take... artflick...errr sure ... depending on how you take your art. ... trippy movie- deserves a sixth star.. have lots of munchies on hand :)
4,Slacker,"movie was not what i expected, but it was what i ordered. received on time and was not damaged. I just did not like the movie"
4,Good as an appetizer,"Basically I do not believe in learning to speak a language without learning to read it at the same time. You will acquire knowledge of the principles of Mandarin pronunciation and some syntax. The course is very repetitive and the amount of vocabulary you will learn is very limited. The repetition is part of the Pimsleur method of memory training, absorption and immersion. Having completed the course, I now feel somewhat familiar with Mandarin pronunciation and at ease with it. But you will only acquire about two or three dozen sentences of polite conversation between an American Gentleman and a Chinese woman he meets."
5,Bix is awesome,"I could tell you all about this, about the superb sound restoration, about the detailed liner notes, and the overall quality of the performances......but chances are, if you're looking at this, you know all about Bix and the name John R. T. Davies means something to you. So buy it already!"
3,its ok,"people who knew them when they were the Clash talking about the times on the road, some art work, not alot of Clash though"
2,I guess I missed the point...,"I'm surprised at the number of good reviews for this book. The premise is VERY intriguing: humans making contact with a ""race"" of evolved robots. The intro gives an interesting (if somewhat overwhelming) account of how the robots came to be, but from there on, the book gets pretty flat. It's crammed with cardboard characters, both human and robot. I really looked forward to reading this, but it sure didn't pay off."
4,Another Brilliant Philosophical Allegory,"This is a very intriguing book that follows the formula of all Hogan's other novels. The plot is used as a tool to examine what ails our society. ""The Legend That Was Earth"" and ""Thrice Upon a Time"" are good examples of this technique. The characters are for the most part very interesting. Zambendorf is in constant conflict with Massey, until they realize that their real goals coincide(i.e., preventing corporate greed from exploiting and destroying an alien race). The book was entirely enjoyable, although the periphery characters were a bit one dimensional. All in all, a great read."
3,Good...but not great,I liked Mr. Hogan's prologue. Interesting primise with the alien creators. I felt the characters come alive through the book and this made it a nice read. I would have liked to seen the author go into more detail on the theological and philosophical points. I think the other readers who gave this book really low ratings missed the whole idea of the book which was about the crimes committed in the name of religion. This point was made clear on the back cover. That being said the book was a nice but simple diversion.
2,victum of bait and switch,I ordered 6 supreme moo mixers. They did arrive before Christmas. I received 6 standard moo mixers that should have been priced lower. I notified the company of the error and didn't receive a response. Very disappointed. Shame on them. I'm a victum of bait and switch.....
5,Might seem over the top but it's not,"Think you don't need a Moo Mixer? Then you haven't despaired when when trying to mix chocolate powder with milk, especially cold milk. This is remarkable and since I don't want my grandson's chocolate milk or hot chocolate to have lumpy bits, I think it's well worth the investment. And it does an amazing job! Besides, I just get a kick out of it."
1,crap,My daughter loves her chocolate milk. worked ok. Broke after 2nd use. very disapointing.I guess nothing beats a good old spoon.
1,"let's be honest, it's crap.",it doesn't mix anything. the bottom broke off after 4 uses. it started leaking after 5 uses. it was a total waste of money.
5,good choc milk,"I bought this for my son for Christmas (17 yrs old). He had asked for it, he saw it in a local store for a higher price. He loves it and uses it every day. (We are going through milk like crazy). The lid is a nice feature too, I don't have to worry about him spilling it if he is walking around with it."
2,"Sadly, the fun doesn't last long...","I bought the Supreme Moo Mixer for my 6-yr old grandson, and he absolutely loved it. His father (my son) thought it was great too and asked why I didn't get him something like that when he was a boy. It was great while it lasted, but sadly, that wasn't long. About a week after we started using it, the mixer stopped working. We changed the batteries and cleaned it, but it wouldn't start again. It is very disappointing to have such a product fail because of poor workmanship."
3,did not receive correct moo mixer,"Although the moo-mixer we recevied is nice, it is not the supreme that we ordered. We ordered the moo-mixer supreme with the lid. If the one that we received (without the lid) had a lid, we would rate it with a 5. It was a christmas gift for our daughter so we did not have time to return it."
2,Fantastic when it doesn't break,"Bought 3 of these for my kids for the holidays, and everyone loved them. Then one week later 2 of them broke. One started leaking and one just stopped working. 3 weeks later the last one broke. A total shame that these could not be made with an ounce of quality to even last a year."
2,Disappointed,This new style is no improvement. The old one was much better. The button is too low and my hand position is always setting it off accidently which has caused a few spills and splatters. Also the gasket or seal in the bottom is loose and allows the drink to leak into the bottom of the cup holder part. Won't buy anymore.
3,"kids love it, me not so much","the kids love it and it is really cute. The problem is that water does get into the battery compartment. not easy to clean without getting water in it. Reading other reviews, I hope it lasts for at least a couple of months."
3,A good idea but......,"We've had three Moo Mixers and two out of the three have worked for about two weeks and then one day it just doesn't. We've tried to clean it in the way the directions tell you, but it seems to have a short life."
2,Not very durable,"I bought this for my six year old for Christmas. Fun idea, bit spinner at the bottom broke within the first week."
3,Moo mixer doesn't moo,Works two or three times and then fails. Changing batteries doesn't fix it. Very good idea but very poor construction.
2,Poor quality,I bought these for my teenage daughters for Christmas. While they are cute they are a recipie for disaster! The plastic cup is tricky to get a seal. Our Christmas day consisted of steam cleaning the living room floor because it came loose while she was taking a drink. The handle was coming apart on one and the wires where sticking out.
2,Work for 1 month and broken,"I love this idea and it works well for my coffee at beginning. However it broken now because of the leaking problem. I am pretty carefully when wash this cup but when I open the bottom for battery housing, you cannot image how bad smell it was there and I throw it away."
1,Moo Mixer supreme did not work my lipton green/honey did not mix,I got the wrong mug trying new battry wier fell into the mug one STAR FOR THE MUG PATTERN. i buy a plain Tornodo 1995 lost in Katrina was so good.
4,Not just for kids,"I purchased the Moo Mixer Supreme for my hubby who loves chocolate milk. At first the mug wasn't mixing very well. My heart sank because I just spent money on this thing that doesn't work.. The motor was extremely slow. We switched over to Energizer batteries and the thing took off! The milk went flying out of the mug! (Keep the lid on, and don't fill it to the top! Lol!) My hubby's been using it almost every day since I bought it for him a month ago. We use rechargeable batteries and it's been on the same 2 from the start. I gave the Moo Mixer Supreme 4 stars because only the lid and ""cup"" part can go in the dishwasher. The handle part can't be submerged because the bottom holds the batteries and motor. Overall it's been a good gift."
2,moo mixer,"We bought two different moo mixers and both of them broke after about 2 weeks. We loved it when it worked, but disappointed at the quality."
5,Wonderful~!,I love this! I hate breakfast so I drink Carnation Instant Breakfast drink with the powder. This mixes it perfectly! I also made my sneaky latte with it. I have the battery operated latte frother but this is better! I put some half and half cream in the moo mixer then mix it a bit until thick then add my coffee! Instant Latte!! I agree it is a little bit overpriced. Should really be about $9.99 but it is good and very easy to clean.
4,Very funny mixer! ),"it's not so big as i thought but big enough to drink a glass of choco milk.the details are a bit shaky, but in common - good present and really exclusive thing! )"
5,Perfect,I purchased this for my 3 year old who loves chocolate milk. This cup is perfect and worth the extra money because it has a top so when he is mixing the milk I don't have to worry about it being all over the floor. Would definitely recommend this cup to anyone!
5,Holy cow! This is fun to use!,"I bought this for my son who is 23 to use. He likes to drink Nesquik powdered chocolate or strawberry milk. He always complained that no matter how long he stirred the powder into the milk, there was always sludge in the bottom of his glass or mug. I bought this for him in hopes this mixer would help. This thing works great, but not only that it is entertaining while you use it. The little motor gets going, creating a vortex in the middle. The flavored milk is smooth and tasty, even giving it a foam on top if you mix it enough. My son loves it, thinks it is great fun and tells me that he has his chocolate or strawberry mixed milk practically every day now. Well, boys will be boys!"
4,A Good Fantasy Movie,"I watched this movie without having ever viewed Merlin. As a stand alone film, I thought it was pretty good. The plot is interesting and the story moves along at a good pace. There are interesting characters and a satisfying conclusion."
1,a disgrace,"of course im a huge fan of the original merlin movie, and so when i saw this hoped it would would be good. it was terrible. a disgrace to the original. and even of it werent an attempted spinoff of merlin, it would still be terrible. to much attempted comedy that wasnt at all funny. a stupid main charecter. and on top of all that, it just all looks fake. not just the special effects, but costumes, dialoge, and set designs. i noticed that they attempted to use some of the same techniqies as the original, such as filming the shadows of trees move, then speeding it up. but it still held nothing in common with the original. as allways, rent it before you buy it. i made that mistake. you might like it, but i doubt it."
2,It's not really bad...but not really great either.,"This movie doesn't really tie into Merlin at all. It's still a fun movie to watch. Plus I love the music, quite lovely really!"
2,Okay...,"but not that great. Way too much silliness for a ""2nd."" It didn't make very much sense and was pretty much a waste of time and money."
1,Definitely a B movie,"I don't understand how anyone can rate this movie or the original Merlin highly. I bought them both as part of a 5-movies for $5 box at Walmart, and was very disappointed. The plot was awful, my 13-year old daughter and I kept looking at each other during the movie, incredulous at the turns in the movie (""People just don't do that!"" trying to kill each other and then turn around and be friends the next moment.) It's like the writers just had another idea, and didn't even bother to go back and revised what they wrote before. Things just don't make any sense. At the end, we just had to start laughing and treating it as a stupid comedy, even though it's not. We were surprised that Sam Neill agreed to act in this movie. The script looks like it was written by an 8-year old."
3,Merlin does a Rip Van Winkle,"And wakes up 50 years after Camelot only to discover that the Grail has been lost and the only hope lies within a thief-conjuror, Gawain's Granddaughter, and the son of the smith--who might just be Arthur incarnate. This particular version of Camelot and Grail-lore just left me wanting to go back and review the good films: Camelot, Mists of Avalon, etc. This is worth a rental, but buy it only if you're an Arthurian afficionado and completist."
3,Merlin's Apprentice,"Fun, but nothing to do with the legend. I enjoy Sam Neill as an actor and the era of the movie. It is OK"
3,Typical Sequel,"Got this as a package deal with the first movie. Didn't really follow the story from the original, but loved Sam Neil as Merlin, so we gave it a chance. Different Lady of the lake, and the plot stalled a couple times. It was pretty good, as a stand alone. As a sequel, not up to par and I'd rather watch ""Merlin"" instead."
4,Inspiring if you can ignore a little of its cheesiness,"As a previous reviewer mentioned, it doesn't really pick up where the last movie left off. In fact, the first movie does a great job of giving you the impression that the story is finished and that there is nothing left.That aside, the new movie is very enjoyable if you like this type of fantasy legend with idealism. There were many good one-liners and aphorisms one could live by.Near the end, it's a little too ""Cinderella"" in its idealism and the special effects look like old Disney effects in a way. But upon watching it for the second time, the message came shining through past some of the little problems.I am glad I bought it and have the first Merlin as well. It's no Lord of the Rings production, but the story behind this movie is golden and worth pondering.Very nice."
2,botched another one,"""Who is the stain on Camelot?"" This story has some interesting ideas in it . . . somewhere. Unfortunately, the plot is so meandering and confusing that any good it might have had disappears. Forget this movie. There are much better Camelot stories than this."
4,Light and enjoyable,"Not a bad kiddie type show. Predictable. Special effects are ok...not the type of movie that would win an award, but, it is the type you can safely watch with your children..and not worry about death and mass destruction being flashed across the screen in technicolor blood."
3,It's an okay movie.,"Okay, now before you believe what everyone else says, I want you to know that the movie isn't that bad. It's not exactly a sequel either. If it was, then it would have picked up from where the previous movie left off. What people need to realize is that both movies are telling the story of Merlin, not the life of Arthur. Honestly, I was disappointed when I saw the movie for the first time. When I watched it again, it seemed like the movie filled in some gaps/holes from the first movie and also told another side to the legend of Merlin. There are different stories that surround the Arthurian Legend. This is probably one of the stories. I bought the DVD because I'm a fan of Sam Neill and the Arthurian Legend. All in all, I liked the movie and how it told another side of Merlin's story."
5,Awesome Symbolism,This song is simply stunning in its symbolism. The lyrics hit me like a ton of bricks and I cried my eyes out. Folks should really give this a listen.
5,A song every person could learn from,"Why is it that this song can send shivers down our spine? This song tells us exactly how we have felt and how we should feel. For those of us who need to learn from past mistakes, listen closely to this song and I guarantee goosebumps."
5,Plan on buying this book!,"Applying to college requires more than just filling out forms and sending in applications. It also requires you to purchase books--books like this one. Written by an astute author, who is accomplished at both applying and being accepted to college, this book will guide you through the perils of college applications. In every sense of the word, this is an informational book (or ""paperback""). Smell that new-book smell when you open it, and then read about college applications like you've never read before!"
5,A Guide We Can Use!,I wish I'd read this book before applying to college. My whole life might have turned out differently.
5,A Must Have,After I heard this CD I purchased a half dozen copies to give to friends! Original music that is truly inspired. Great horn section. One of the best small-group releases I've ever heard.
2,"It's not the product, it's the seller","These compatible cartridges worked just fine in the past for me. In fact, I've tried to order them twice in the past few weeks from eforcity. In both cases, the orders were not completed. They sat on the second order for over a week with no explanation as to why. They used to be responsive, but it seems that has changed. They did claim my charge would be returned, but I've not yet confirmed this."
5,OLD book of poems about a cockroach & a cat,"I bought a set of these for my sisters. I already had a copy from decades ago. I currently own a rescued feral moma kitty who I should have named Mehitabel. You may forget Archy, but you will never forget Mehitabel."
5,Family affair...,"I've known of this book since the 40's and it has been a family favorite since then. Now it's my daughters time to enjoy it!Thanks,Bill H."
5,A fun read!,"""Archie and Mehitabel"" is a book written and published in the early 1900's by Don Marquis. It is about Archie, a poet and philosopher in a former life, transmigrated into the body of a cockroach. At night he takes over the typewriter of a human writer who is kind enough to always leave an empty sheet of paper in it before retiring. Archie pounds out stories about himself, his views and feelings, working with all his might. The other character is Archie's friend Mehitibel, a very precocious alley cat, transmigrated into her present form but having once been Cleopatra. Mehitabel exhibits a special savoir-faire. She has many adventures which Archie types out so the world will know how Mehitabel survives on the streets, her philosophy and off-handed views of life. It also shows her acceptance of life as it is and her philosophical turnings. Their adventures are a delight for those who enjoy the whimsical, have a vivid imagination, and are fun-loving in spirit."
4,a classic,"I have an old hard cover copy that at belonged to my dad. I have been reading it on and off to my kids for the last 10 years or so. My 13 year old son loves it. He knows all the characters and the story line. So this birthday I am getting him the long, lost issues of Archy and Mehitabel. It is poetry disguised as a story!"
5,Treasure from a forgotten author,"I have read several works by Don Marquis and find them charming, irreverent, and very relevant to today's world. He has been long forgotten which is a terrible shame. First published in 1927, it is a treasure of wit and pokes fun at nearly everything. I highly recommend it, especially as a gift to stuffed shirts, preachers, and high society."
5,archy & mehitabel,"I am now in my 70's and am ordering this book for my son. I have just been remembering the wonderful books in my past and want them to continue to live. I might just order a copy for myself, too."
4,Awesome,This was the first time I ordered my Halloween costume on-line. This was a great costume very good quality and I got it in plenty of time for my party. The only thing is that the size is not at all accurate I am a size 7 and it was pretty tight so if you are a larger size I would not purchase this product. Other than than that it was a hit.
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Another example of the often overused device of bringing super characters back from the dead. It is not done too badly here, though. The Jason Todd character, who people voted to get rid of, is brought back to be a destabilising force in Gotham City. He has become a vigilante, Punisher style, taking out the crooks around the place in a permanent shuffle off the mortal coil fashion."
4,Good for catch up!,"I was out of comics for a while, and picked this Graphic Novel, great way to catch up!"
5,The Past Shall Come Back to Haunt Him..,"Gotham's criminal underworld is ruled by Black Mask. But someone is trying to undermine his operations...and it's not Batman. His face is one well known among comic fans...The face of Jason Todd. Now Batman has to face his worst fears: His former protege has returned from death to battle evil on his own, lethal terms.This is an excellent story, Judd Winick is an incredible writer who knows how to spin a tale that entertains readers. I love his use of dialogue, ""Do you prefer I call you Black Mask...Mr. Mask...Blackie?"" He is able to make the characters real and Batman is excellent in this story. I highly reccomend that you buy it."
4,Batman's past catches up with him,"This is an interesting and very well written series. The dialogue is sharp, quick-witted, and fun to read. I enjoyed the beautiful artwork and the story line was un-muddled and easy to follow. Bats comes in contact with a few old cronies as well with satisfying results. I won't give away the ending, but it makes me wish for more."
5,Industrial Quality at Good Price,I'm using it right now. This stand fits in my very small sleeve that I use for my mac. It is nicely machined and sturdy. Very clean. I got one for each member of the family
5,Outstanding stand!,"This is the coolest notebook stand ever. It really does fold small enough to fit in your shirt or cargo pocket, but still support my 17"" VAIO. Outstanding construction and quality. Good looking, people will stop and ask about it. THE item for Notebook/Laptop warriors. This little guy will fit in just about any bag or case. I'm buying several more for friends and family.Sometimes simple IS the best way, and this guy is as simple as it gets."
3,Targus Notebook Cooling Mobile X Notebook Stand,The product was delivered to my mailing address in California after 3 days in good condition. Product was what I wanted and I am satisfied with it after 2 months of use.
3,On average it is OK,It is actually much bigger for my 9' laptop but fortunately I have a 13' one so that I don't have to return this.
5,"Useful, durable product","I've owned this laptop cooling stand for several years now. It has proved to be a very sturdy product. It is in as good a shape now as when I bought it. It folds up easily and is quite small when compacted, fitting easily into a purse or backpack.I like this product so much, I have bought several as presents for family members, who love it as well."
4,Slick little cooling stand,"Keeps laptop cool; folds up quickly and easily. Oddly, the photos on the internet and package seem to show the product in a totally incorrect position. From what is shown, it needs to be flipped over and rotated 180 degrees away from the user. Then, it works perfectly for stable, effective cooling."
2,Way too complicated!,"I agree with the other reviewers - way too complicated to be a good workout. She starts with what could be a great routine and then adds about a million pivots to it until all you're doing is turning in circles. I have a fairly strong background in dance. It's been a few years since I quit but I had danced since I was young and let me tell you, the years of experience were no help at all! I thought that the bonus features, which break down the steps, would help me figure it out but even there she just breezes through them! Rather than repeating a move several times and explaining what she is doing, she does it twice and moves on to the next move. After several attempts to decipher the routines, I gave up and went back to my Crunch videos (which I would highly recommend)."
3,bad sizing,"Be careful... what you get may be different than the photo! I thought I had ordered the Ace TekZone wrist wrap with gel padding, but received the ""basic"" wrist brace without gel (the photo shows the blue-green gel). Not a big deal, but the items are apparently sized differently. My original TekZone was a medium and fit well whereas the ""basic"" was a SM/Med and was MUCH too small (and I have a small wrist). This bad sizing was not my mistake, but the vendor (not Amazon) will not refund the shipping!"
3,Decent support,"I've found this brace to be most comfortable if I remove the metal splints, even for night time use. It keeps the wrist supported and warm and allows a bit of flexibility. The velcro is losing a bit of staying power after being in use for 2 weeks. I've found a brace with a thumb splint to be more useful than this one for my particular kind of tendonitis."
4,Not very well translated,"It's an excellent novel that transgresses the limitations of the detective genre. Unfortunately, the translation is not very good. It inexplicably removes the opening part of the story, and this reduces the book's charm."
2,Disappointed,"I was disapointed when I received this shirt. The description claimed ""heavyweight"" cotton. The actual shirt was very thin. I was looking for a thicker shirt. It's a nice shirt but very thin material."
3,Too Small,This shirt is a full size smaller than other brands. I bought an XL and it fits like a large. I'm not too angry about it. I'll just give it to my son. But just be advised to buy a size larger than normal. I gave it three stars because I wasn't crazy about the thickness either. It's thinner than Haynes Beefy T and the old Russell Athletic T-shirts I have.
3,Good price,"I just wish it was more of a relaxed fit. Bought a medium but feels more like a small because it's a very trim fit. Prefer a little more room, but good quality & good price."
5,Makes it so easy!,"If you ever wanted to help someone, this is the video to watch and use. I really loved the Dianetics book, but I found this video distilled the most salient points in the book so that you can start to use the techniques to help someone. At times like these,when so many people have suffered loss from the September 11th attacks, and most of our friends, neighbors and family could use a hand coping with further threats, this technology is all-the-more relevant, and this video helps put the tools right in your hands."
5,Works very well with the Humzinger feeder,"I have had one of these for several years and I am about to order another one. We use it with the Humzinger hummingbird feeder in the summer (easily the best hummingbird feeder we have ever used) and it helps to keep the feeder shaded in sun and dry when it rains. We use it in the winter with a regular seed feeder for winter birds, and it keeps the seed dry and free of snow. It has held up very well being outside 24/7 all year round for at least 5 years now, and it's still going strong."
3,Freaked my Hummers Out,"I thought this was just the ticket to keep rain out of my Humzinger feeders (which I LOVE, by the way). But the hummingbirds hate it. The slightest breeze makes it swing wildly, and it makes this grating squeaking sound when it swings (probably the metal hook rubbing on the metal feeder holder). My hummingbirds either fly off immediately, or they perch on the feeder, look up at the Humbrella, and squeak at it before flying away. I wound up using it to cover my finch thistle feeder and it has done an OK job at that, but I would not buy another one. The product is sturdy and well-made, though. It just didn't work out for the hummingbirds."
2,Had to return because parts were missing.,"I was unable to use the Humbrella Dome because all I received was the dome. The parts to hang the dome were missing, so I returned it. The return and credit to my account went smoothly."
1,Humbrella feeder a waste of money,"I bought this feeder along with its humbrella after reading the positive reviews, but can't figure out where one could use it outdoors. The slightest breeze causes this feeder to swing, dumping nectar on the ground. It did not attract hummingbirds -- probably because it was always out of nectar. I have just put this feeder in the trash and replaced it with a cheap one from Lowes. Don't waste your money."
1,Okay story. Horrible Illustrations.,What a mess. The illustrations by this Hank Hinton guy looks like something done by a first year art student.It's a shame too because Tolkien's work always seems more enjoyable with a good rawing or too.It appears the book is out of print. One look at the illustrations and I can see why.
5,Chris Tomlin is awesome!,"If you have heard his music, you know that Chris Tomlin is an incredible worshipper and all he does is try to get you to the place where you see God face to face. The book is great! Chris combines lyrics, Scripture and notes from his heart to move the worshipper into a deeper relationship with God and to become a true worshipper in Spirit and in truth... If you love his albums, the book is a must!"
4,The Way I Was Made: Words and Music for an Unusual Life,"This was a fun book to read. The author is funny and at times you laugh out loud at his painful descriptions of his early experiences of being a musician and worship leader. He is honest and encouraging in helping people search and understand that God has very specific plans for our lives. My favorite line is ""old men eating pancakes"" - it's a great picture of seemingly nothing going on in your life but in reality God is moving. Good book."
4,"Not a review, but a question.","For those who really like this product, can anyone tell me if this will work in heavy clay soils? I've tried the garden claw, which works, but the effort to move it in clay soils ended up in an ER visit later. I don't have an issue with dandelions, but do spend much of the season pulling up ragweed and other southwest weeds with a bad back."
5,Buy this tool,"This tool is the best weed remover I've ever seen for getting those dandelions, thistles and other weeds with tap roots out of the lawn. It removes the entire weed, with the root included, in one easy operation. It works so slick that taking those dandelions out is actually fun."
1,Broke,I used this for about 15 minutes and it was working great. I got to a large dandelion and when I tried to flip it out I heard a crack and it was broke. I returned it the same day.
1,Lasted Less than an Hour,After a few tries with this tool I was feeling like a pro quickly filling a garbage bag with dandelions. Large dandelions came out of the ground with ease. Every now and then I would come across a smaller dandelion in hard or mossy soil that just didn't want to come out of the ground and took extra effort. It was one of these that caused it to crack. I had maybe an hour of use before this happened. This tool did leave sizable holes behind. I don't know yet if it pulled enough of the dandelion to keep it from growing back. A better technique would have been to spray the dandelions with a grass friendly weed killer and removed them a day or two later but I was so excited to have a new toy I couldn't wait. I went to my local hardware store and found an all metal competitor that looked like it would last longer. Unforunately it doesn't grasp them as well as this one did and some times leaves part of the plants behind.
4,UpRoot Weeder,"My wife and I both find this to be a usefull tool. It pulls deep weeds out without bending over and with little effort.It is not, however, a weeding cureall as it is better suited to large weeds and tears up too much lawn for use on many small weeds."
4,No more standing on my head!,"Fiskars UpRoot Weeder #7870With arthritic hands and an intense dislike for spending hours bending over while blood rushes to my head, I surveyed the weeds in my flower beds with great frustration. The Fiskars Uproot Weeder seemed to be the answer to my problem. Although I had some doubts, I'm happy to say that it really works! I received it promptly and immediately went outside and tested it. Success and pain-free! I highly recommend it for folks with my problems and even for folks who have become slaves to stabbing and pulling at the weeds only to suddenly hear the dreaded sound of a fat root breaking in half!"
5,excelleng buy,Grandpa's Weed PullerI find very few products advertised on T.V. that i would even consider. This product lives up to all that was promised in the ad. It is one of the most valuable tools in my tool collection. This is a four star piece of equipment that I would recommend to anyone.
5,THE PERFECT WEEDER,"Fiskars has sone it again. This is the easiest weeder I have ever used. It works on small and very large weeds. It works so well, other people I know have bought one from just trying it once. It also works on crabgrass or anything else you want to pull out of the ground."
3,There are worse ways to spend 74 minutes,"Reasonably entertaining 1974 made-for-TV period flick has a decent pedigree-- written by John Milius ('Dillinger,' 'Red Dawn') and directed by Dan Curtis (TV's 'Dark Shadows,' 'The Winds of War')-- but manages to rise only a notch or two above average for fare of this type. The story, based in part on real events, centers on legendary FBI agent Purvis as he tracks down notorious gangster George Barnes, a.k.a. 'Machine Gun Kelly,' and his entourage following their kidnapping-for-ransom of wealthy Oklahoma resident Charles Urschel (here renamed Thatcher Covington) in the early 1930s. With the assistance of a good cast (many familiar character actors from film and television), the overall effect is not dissimilar from Arthur Penn's revisionist 'Bonnie and Clyde' or Milius's own 'Dillinger,' sanitized for the public airwaves. 3 stars (3-plus if you like your car chases accompanied by jaw harp)."
4,Solid Trustworthy Consise Desk Top Reference,"First, I like this book. I trust about every line of it. It is itself precise or at least as precise as possible. It summarizes things in a concise and complete way. Required prior knowledge is UML (of course). I'd recommend Fowler's beautiful UML distilled and also even more important a solid understanding of design by contract. I recommend the complete book of Bertrand Meyer ""Object Oriented Software Construction"". Yes I know its many month of reading.The problem with this OCL book is the following: It is difficult to understand anything not prior understood. However once one has a grasp of understanding this book is really clarifying. So, it requires in many areas more maturity in the field than most of us including me have. So, I would wish a book, which starts of at a somewhat lower level, in a less dry diction."
3,Nice introduction,"This book is a nice introduction, into something with quite some potential.If you've never heard of OCL, and wonder what it's all about, then you definitely need this book.If you have seen OCL before, but you don't have a reference manual, this is also the book you need.If you're looking for a coherent way to use UML and OCL together, then you might want to take a look at 'Object, Components and Frameworks with UML; The Catalysis Approach'."
1,A phone message for Chronic Future...,"To the guys in Chronic Future...311 called and said ""they want their music back."""
5,From 3 songs I practicly like this album,"I don't own this album but when I heard 4 Elements,come correct,and jump to live I was amazed.These songs were awesome!"
2,This album is Decent,"This album is good, but it lacks originality. The band 311 has been creating music like this for several years now. I do think that this album is much better than their prior album. Some of the lyrics contradict themselves though. This is confusing to me. I think that ""come correct"" is a made for radio song in that it copies what is currently being aired. Less than half of the songs on this album are decent. The band also did not put on a very good show when I saw them in concert."
3,pretty good,this Divas Dvd most definatley topped last years. they had a good shoot the divas were hotter than h e doulbe hockey sticks i mean bikkinis are out lingrie is totally in. i wish they took all the christy hemme matches out and replace them with the divas battle royal from the eddie gurrero tribute raw and the divas tag team match when candice michelle has a wardrobe malfuction
4,"Great device, Bad documentation","I use the LinkRunnerPro to troubleshoot a domain with 150 nodes. This little device has helped my quickly diagnose problems over and over and the first request I will make if I go to a different job will be for another copy. But, if you do not have experience with this sort of device learning it's quirks can be a little frustrating. Fluke has tremendous documentation for most of it's devices, including detailed user manuals and instructional online videos. The LinkRunnerPro, however, comes with a totally lame quickstart guide that fails to disclose what all of the icons and indicators actually symbolize. There is no additional documentation or instructions online. Don't expect to use it out of the box to troubleshoot. You may need to spend several hours walking around your network with it, figuring out how it actually works.LinkRunnerPro = *****LinkRunnerPro Documentation = *"
5,Best network tester I've owned,"This is absolutely the best network tester I've owned.Make sure you upgrade yours to the latest firmware, this corrects the ""waiting game issue"" another reviewer was talking about.I love being able to plug in and identify which VLAN and physical port I'm in (I use only Cisco managed switches, your results may vary with other switches)Wish the network ID sticks weren't so expensive, but at least it comes with one :)"
1,Useless device - LRPRO-1000 Linkrunner Pro Network Multimeter,Don't buy LRPRO-1000 Linkrunner Pro Network Multimeter.The older version device called Fluke Networks NT-PRO Network Cable Tester work much better and fast.In the same environment. Linkrunner Pro took 5 mins to locate switchport information compare to NT-PRO it took 30 sec.The only drawback from NT-PRO was it didn't support Gig connection.The following tools good but expensive.NetTool(tm) Series II Inline Network Tester
3,Great design...........,".......however, they could have been better crafted. They are veeeeeeery pretty but really thin. I've bought equally pretty sterling silver earrings of BETTER quality for a third of this price."
5,Beautiful earrings!,I absolutely love these earrings - they are a great alternative to the typical hoop earring. I received them about a month ago and I've been wearing them every day. I saw the review about the earwires but they are actually very solid - perhaps they improved them.
1,poor,"the lotus part of the earring was pretty, but the hook was very poor quality and probably would have broken the first time I wore it. I returned it."
3,"OK, but not great","In depth about the music of George and Little Feat, but not very much personal information about Lowell George."
2,George bio big disappointment,"I have been a Lowell George fan since just after he passed away, and have been waiting for a good biography -- this isn't it. The writer gets far too bogged down in details that just don't matter (for instance, pinpointing EXACTLY when George joined Frank Zappa's band) and just skims over stuff about collaborations that I would have enjoyed reading about, not to mention more information about George himself. This book is more like a timeline with commentary that centers on music criticism than a more traditional biography. I would pass on it unless you are interested in tedious details. I wish I had."
4,on my top-5 list of My favorite rock and roll slide-players,"Enjoyable book, well-written. I learned somethings about Lowell that I didn't know before. And I thought I knew a lot already!If you're a fan of Lowell George, I highly recommend it."
5,Still Wild At Heart!,This soundtrack is still rocking strong. Like the film the tracks are a wild journey that will have you rocking and rolling.
4,lynch is a tripper,"unlike most the other collaborations between lynch and angelo badalamenti this soundtrack is very diverse inthat it features everything from 50's rock to speed metal and of coarse those lavish instrumentals.for some reason I don't like w@h as much as the other lynch soundtracks,but it's still better than 90% of the majority of film music out there today(hence the 4 stars).with songs like chris isaak's""wicked game""(my favorite part in the film),the instrumental of ""cool cat walk""(lated rerecorded w/julee cruise on vocals), the original version of ""up in flames""with raspy vocals(another song later redone by julee on her 2nd cd),and the cool-but-laughable ""slaughterhouse""by powermad(think slayer meets motley crue sorta)THIS ALBUM IS DEFINATLY WORTH YOUR $10!(or $2.50 if you can find one used like I did!)"
5,Who couldn't love this album?,This a fantastic album that gets played over and over in our house. We love her upbeat tempo and the sway in her voice when she slows it down... definetly a keeper.
5,This has got to be the best of the few country CDs I bought.,"The first time I heard a Jo Dee Messina song was the MTV of ""Bye Bye"" and it caught my attention. I'm not a big country music fan but from then on, I started tuning my stereo to country music stations and patiently waiting on this song. I heard her songs ""I'm Alright"" & ""Stand Beside Me"" and that has made me put this album to the top.MORE POWER TO YOU JO DEE AND YOUR ALBUM ""I'M ALRIGHT""..."
5,What a great listen!,"My collection runs thru a huge spectrum of music. Country joined the roster 2 years ago, and Jo Dee's 2nd CD is in the highest-rotation shelf. It's not because every song is awesome, but because she puts so much of herself into the ten she's chosen to record. The ""hits"" are strong pieces, worth adding to any music-lover's collection, but I think the real gem is one of the tracks that didn't get released: ""Silver Thunderbird."" It's country, new-school style, but it's a great song, period. Something about this song just resonates with me. And that's what matters most -- not the politics of Nashville, not the pressure to sell 10 million copies -- the music on the CD. This CD has great music; definitely a treat to add to your collection."
5,Hottest album going!,"Jo Dee expresses emotional and fun songs throughout this record. It was given to me as a present and I listened to it all the way through once and ever since then it was played through my radio 24/7...it's a CD you can't get tired of either!!I am very much looking forward to more from Jo Dee, I have to say, I feel she will go far in country music and her music is one of a kind!!"
5,She's done it again!,"""I'm Alright"" is quite a masterpiece of country music. Messina has succeeded in creating the collage of love songs, tearjerkers, and future dance hits that was also present on her debut album. This particular ablum is surprisingly mature to be only her second. ""Stand Beside Me"", ""Even God Must Get the Blues"", and the title song ""I'm Alright"" are different in their own rights, yet retain a certain consistency. Her talent is unquestionable, as is her ability to convey emotions. I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys light rock, classic, or modern country."
5,this CD is one of the best i have.,"my sister made me listen to her bye-bye single and i loved it. the cd never fails to get me in a good mood and make me dance. i also have her i'm alright cd and that is awesome as well. her songs have such and upbeat tune to them and the words are just...awesome. they really make you happy and get you to stand back and say, ""wow, i love my life. who cares about what happened yesterday or the week before, i have to keep on going and enjoy this kick-a** life!"" i highly recommend going out to the music store and buying this cd for you or anyone you care about."
5,WONDERFUL!!!,"This cd is wonderful. I love the song ""Lesson In Leavin'"". She is a wonderful singing. I love to sit down and leason to her cd. Its worth buying."
3,The Curse of Auto-tune,"Hands down, this is one of the best collection of great, soulful songs put out by Nashville. Throughout college and grad school, this was my go to CD for long road trips home. How can you not smile while listening to Jo Dee singing Silver Thunderbird? I get kind of a lump in my throat just thinking about it.Unfortunately, I just can't listen to album anymore. When I listen to this album, I hear Jo Dee's great voice. I hear great lyrics. But most of all, I hear the sheer, awful amount of autotuning.It's infuriating, especially since it roboticizes her beautiful, natural, husky singing voice.If this album were de-overproduced, I think I'd rate this back up at 5 stars. As it stands, 3 stars.A great album marred by Nashville overproduction."
5,Messina Makes Good on Promise Of Her Debut,"Jo Dee Messina's sophomore effort finds her mining much the same territory that made her debut one of the better records of '96,and ultimately improving on that set's track record. Always the thinking woman, Messina packs this disc with her now trademark brand of soaring-chorus anthems, highlighted by the singles'Bye Bye','Stand Beside Me',and the superb title track. There's actually not a track on here that couldn't have been a single, and Messina also includes some astute cover choices, particularly'Lesson In Leavin' and 'I Know A Heartache'. While there's nothing here that matches the emotional punch of the first set'ssterling 'Let It Go', overall the program here remains the stronger song cycle. Highly recommended."
5,Jo Dee Tops on my list,"Jo Dee is a down to earth person. Her songs on this album reflects just that. From ""Bye-Bye"" to ""I'm Alright"" show she can relate to all fans and the music she sings. She puts all her heart into her shows. I have seen her perform live twice and each time have met with her in person. She is a sincere person and she truly believes in her fans and the music she sings. Five stars is not enough to rate this album. 10+ stars is more like it. If you have'nt bought this album you don't know what you are missing!"
5,"Jo Dee, Just plain AWESOME!","I absolutely adore Jo Dee Messina! She is one of the most engaging and talented performers ever! If you haven't seen her live, you must! It is then that you'll realize that she's not only an incredible singer but a sweet and sincere person who loves her fans and shares her faith in God with all she meets. I really admire and respect her for all that she stands for -- what a wonderful role model to have these days :)"
5,thicker than water,Absolutely love this movie. The scenery is very breathtaking and beautiful. The script and characters are very true to form.
5,One of my favorites,Saw this movie on TV and enjoyed it so much I was happy to find it on DVD. Two of my favorite actresses....Melissa Gilbert and Lindsay Wagner.
5,Good Story,"it only proves that blood is thicker than water. a very good movie andI was not disappointed in the movie. It only goes to prove that there aresome good directors and producers out there - that ""clean"" family moviescan be made and are here to stay. Keep up the good work."
4,Gentle On My Mind,Loved the movie - Lindsay Wagner and Melissa Gilbert are two of my favorite actresses. The CD was a great bonus and excellent followup to the peacefulnessof the great outdoors. Some people that are involved in the fast paced lifeare drawn into the seduction of the quiet tranquility of being in an open space with nature and really looking at the world around you and discovering what's really matters in life.
2,Thicker than water,A film to watch before going to bed. Nothing extraordinary in the story or performances of actors. Just Ok! to relax a little.
1,Gilbert and Wagner can not act....,"Just about every one of the TV shows and films they have done have been lousy. I guess when you can not act, It shows. This film should have been titled Oil and Water don't mix."
4,Michael Bolton at his BEST!! Rocking Out!!,"This is a great album and is the first recording for Michael Bolton (yes the ""Sittin on the Dock of the Bay"" guy.........this album ROCKS....he really shows his stuff on this release. You will be shocked.GET IT NOW!"
4,"Behind the scenes, more than just the drivers","A coffe table style book that introduces you to some of the many people that work behind the drivers. If you're new to racing or NASCAR this book will help you understand the size and scope of modern auto racing. This is a BIG BUSINESS with a incredible amount of talented people involved. Full color, over 160 pages."
4,"FRANTASTIC, BUT NOT ENOUGH","The word ""complete"" is pretty definitive, but I have to dispute the description because two of the tracks (namely ""A Sunday Kind of Love"" and ""Early Autumn"") are shown as being previously unreleased alternate takes. Fair enough, but why then aren't the two released takes included also? Had they been, it would have increased the total number of tracks from fourteen to sixteen. It's only that short measure which has held me back from a full five stars, because Fran Warren's voice is quite superlative; she favours the upper register yet there's no sense either of strain or sharpness in her delivery. As for the accompaniment, it is just out of this world, beautiful arrangements which sit perfectly behind the vocal, and are embellished by the piano playing of Claude Thornhill."
5,Great,More pointers for my homilies. What a great book that can be used as a resourse when the need arises.
4,Military Strategy Reviewed,"Although written soon after the Second World War and therefore a little dated and superceded by a revised edition by Peter Paret, the subject areas covered still have value and interest for the military historian in tracing the development of military thought beyond Jomini and Clausewitz. Well worth purchasing alongside the Paret edition."
5,This book is the reason I got a Kindle!,"I love this book. I have the hard copy version as well, and one on Gospelink, but neither of those is as portable as I was wanting. I love having it handy on my Kindle as I study the D&C;, prepare or present lessons or just catch up on my church history.The book is a compilation of years of study of every person mentioned in the Doctrine and Covenants. Whatever is known about an individual, birth, death, marriage, family, accomplishments, friend or foe, faithful or apostate. It's all here, concise, and accurate.Anyone who has had the privilege of having Susan Easton Black as their instructor can appreciate the devotion she puts into her work."
5,"Fast shipping, item as described",Book is a great resource to learn about people who are mentioned in the Doctrine & Covenants. People are listed in alphabetical order in the book. At the beginning of their info the sections where they are mentioned are noted. It would be nice to have a cross referenced index with the sections listed in order & the people referenced to the sections as well. Overall this is a wonderful resource.
5,Love love love this book!,You can't go wrong with this author! I love looking up people in this book to give me a quick overview. Susan doesn't sugar coat it either and tells you the truth. She does so much research on her topics and includes very interesting tidbits. It is a beautiful book to hold but handy to have in kindle format. This is a great reference book if you want to know more about the person.
3,review #1,"This books is great for beginners. It is structured in a way that in every lesson, you can learn a new verb form, another grammatical form, as well as some cultural background.My school used it to teach portuguese. They prefer because 1) tapes are included, and 2) you can use the book at your own pace. I did the entire book in one quarter!I am actually purchasing it again, because it is not only a great learning device but also a good reference for once you've learned."
2,It rolls and can be handled easily,"Positives:The ball is brightly colored and can be handled easily by an older infant because it has finger holes.Negatives:It doesn't always make sounds especially when it rolls. You have to be a bit rough with it to make sounds, for example, letting it roll down steps. Also, it squeaks like a dog toy."
2,Not good quality ball,"I expected that wiggly giggly ball will better quality. But he did not. Design is a curve, lines are sloppy and greased. And the ball does not round, it is a crooked. It is really more like a toy for dogs, but not for little baby."
2,Is mine defective?,"I have the 4.5 inch wiggly giggly toy for my standard poodle and he absolutely LOVES it. He is absolutely joyous in his play with it. Because I had also tried the dumbell style which he destroyed with chewing in the first hour he had it, I thought I would add this large wiggly giggly ball to his toy bin. It hardly makes any noises as it rolls across the floor and hence he is less interested in it as a plaything. Does anybody know if there is a difference in the noisemaking between the 4.5 inch one and the 7 inch one? If there is not supposed to be a difference then perhaps the one I received it defective. I would like to know because I think the smaller ball is just great -- 5 stars all around -- and would like to have another such fun toy for my dog in a larger size."
2,Giggly Ball,Not what I was expecting. More like a dog toy. would not recommend buying not worth the money. Disappointed with product!!
4,"Nice, neutral utility at a good price","Nothing fancy or formal but a nice-enough pitcher that keeps beverages chilled without diluting. No photo was available at the time so I bought this sight unseen, placing my faith in the Bodum design aesthetic, and was pleasantly surprised. It's not beautiful but it's basic, inoffensive, and slightly more attractive than the current photo depicts."
4,Easy to follow,"I began this book with limited Reporting Services experience, not really knowing what to expect. What I found in every chapter was that the authors really took the time to explain the nuances of this technology that can only be understood from working with it in the real-world and not on a sample database with simple reports. I also learned much more about basic and advanced queries that really helped me out with parameters and stored procedures. I would definitely recommend this book for everyone new to reporting services and those who would like to get answers to detailed reporting scenarios."
2,You should probably look elsewhere,"I found this book to be weird quiet frankly. Chapter 2 goes off the deep-end of designing efficient queries before you've even built a report yet. That material should have been put at the end of the book. Creating a report with the report wizard is covered in Chapter 4 but probably would have been best if it was before Chapter 3 which covers creating a report manually. I didn't find anything ""Pro"", as the name implies, or advanced with the book. It's a broad introductory text only. Also, it only covers using the ReportViewer control for Win Forms and not the one Web Forms. The two are similar enough but coverage of both would have been better."
3,Brenda Jackson My Girlfriend,"Brenda, I loved the story of Kyle and Kimaria, it is a beautiful and very romantic love story that finally came true. It was very - very - very well written, I must say. It was breathless and I read it three times. This novella was deeply rich with all the key essences that it take to make a fabulous and romantic story to come together. My Sister, words can only express my gratitude for your beautiful style of writing."
2,Okay but not all it's cracked up to be,"Jess Franco always makes weird stuff. This does not dissapoint. It's not great, but it's a decent film. If you go in not expecting too much you may enjoy it."
3,"Slasher Has Some Good Gore, But It's Mostly A Bloody Bore","Bloody Moon is a foreign slasher flick from 1981 that has some great gore and nudity. However, the script and the dubbing are both atrocious. And the movie appears to not even have a plot until the surprise ending."
5,what a great surprise,I listened to this album again and again and had to buy copies for everyone. This is just great from beginning to end.
5,A must for Joker fans!,"5 stars just for the look. This just looks really cool on your bookshelf.Joker fans must have, great reads."
1,I am taking them back for a credit,"These shades do not stick to any windows(car, house or mirrors). Maybe every window we have is defective. I would advise you not to purchase them or if you do KEEP YOUR RECEIPT."
5,Favourite Alert!!,"This overgrip is gooooood. I recommended it to m players with Radical Liquidmetals and it worked like... magic. Simply amazing grip and it's great. Others use it with other racquets, but I noticed a common fit with Radical Liquidmetals."
3,Not unforgettable single,"Quite difficult to review a 2 tracks CD: anyway Commitment is much better that the title track. Anyway every single by LeAnn deserve to be bought, so buy confident!"
4,Good but pricey,"Because of the cost of shipping, I bought two of these although I only needed one. The bulbs arrived on time and in good condition. I have been using one bulb multiple times per day for about 4 months and it is still working well. It was easy to install. I am very happy with the product except for the price and shipping cost."
1,Retiring Abroad?,This book is useless. You can find more pertinent and up to date information online.
3,Trekie,I knew the first Generation movie stunk aas I saw it when it premired. The Borg movie was very good. I saw that whem it primered. The last one was new to me. I never heard of it. But it was good. I reccomend the Borg and new one.
5,Great generations !,"From Kirk to Picard, the crew of Enterprise have taken us to voyage throught over the galaxy within past quater centenary. However, it is impossible to keep the same crew always bring us new adventures. In Enterprise-D, which lead by Jean-Luc Picard, the new crew brought us another different style from those lead by Kirk. It also reflects the changes of view in our society within these years. In Star trek VII : Generations, although it's a tragic loss of Kirk's death, the film has made the formal announcement of the connection between two generations and beginning of new ones. In First Contact and Insurrection, we can meet the biggest ememy of human beings from both inside(greedy) and outside(the Borg). This collection set is very valuable to Star trek fan because of its representative of generations!"
5,A Must Have for all Trekkies!,"These 3 movies are great. It should be in everyone's DVD collection. They all are OUTSTANDING quality (especially audio). Buy this now, you wont regret it. Generations and First Contact are excellent, but Insurrection was not so good. You will enjoy these 3 great movies."
5,lizzbomb review,"I AM 1 OF THE FEW ENGLISH TNG FANS.GENERATIONS IS MY FAVOURITE FILM I LIKE THE MIX OF THE ORIGINAL SERIES AND THE NEXT GENERATION.INSURRECTION ALSO HAS SOME VERY GOOD ONE LINERS.IF YOU LOVE STAR TREK,THE NEXT GENERATION AS I DO THIS IS A MUST FOR YOU.BUY IT AND ENJOY,LIVE LONG AND PROSPER!!!!!!"
1,This is phoney Star Trek.,"The last ten years and three Star Trek movies have been nothing short of a big joke and these three movies with their bad stories and pretty below par acting show that. Maybe when Scott Backula and the crew of the new ENTERPRISE show, take over the movies. these films may be back to being worthy to be called Star Trek films again. Until then the movie theater is closed."
2,Unimpressed,"Don't get me wrong, I love Star Trek just as much as the next Trekker. However, the whole point of DVD's is the added features (in my opinion). This set included VERY LITTLE in the way of features. Woo-hoo I can skip instantly to Kirk's death. The one comfort I take in buying this set is that DVD cases take up less space and weigh less than VHS... I expect better from Paramount."
5,LOVE IT!!!!,I am a secret trekkie! I was raised on all the star treks. My dad and I watched them as much as we can can. I bought this dvd for fim and he loved it.

Elimination Chamber match for the WWE ChampionshipJohn Cena vs Shawn Michaels vs Kurt Angle vs Kane vs Carlitovs Chris Masters8. WWE ChampionshipJohn Cena vs Edge
4,An average PPV,"Well, let's see, CENA LOSES THE TITLE AT THIS ELIMINATION CHAMBER. So, what else is new? It was so obvious that Cena was gonna get the title back in not too long. Edge never changed the title back to narmal from bling-bling. If you hate cena than buy this PPV cause throughout the match the fans are booing cena, wow! I was a fan of Cena back when he was on SD but now he is nothing more than a bad champion, I mean HE CAN'T WRESTLE, yeah maybe he is entartaining but don't ever give him the title again after WM22. Give it to Kurt, HHH, god even Edge but not Cena. // 5/10"
4,Good way to start off 2006,"This was a pretty good PPV. If you've not seen it, then order the dvd. I'm so glad there's a NEW WWE Champion. I can't stand that Faggit Cena Over Rated BIG Time."

2,I AGREE WITH BUCKLEY(PREVIOUS REVIEWER),"All Vince McMahon does care about is money and ratings and the tarts-Its never the fans.The reason his WWE PPVs suk is cause he hardly ever uses ""Special"" Matches-Yes the matches that made his old WWF and early WWE PPVs good-His PPVs are just like watching RAW or SmackDown! just normal matches(normal tag-matches,single matches with DQ and countouts etc) even those normal matches are not good!I remember the previews for WWE WrestleMania XXI-the man said ""We all know ANYTHING can happen when WWE and Hollywood colide!"" but unfortunatly NOTHING happened they had only one special match(MONEY IN THE BANK-LADDER MATCH0 and a Sumo match and ""Pipers Pit"" the rest were krap-""Legend vs. Legend Killer"" typical UnderTaker WM match-Vince has made money on Takers undefeated streak at WrestleMania he ain`t gonna let someone out of the blooms win.-(...)"
5,And the NEW...WWE CHAMP...,"This was really a great ppv to watch, even if you are a die-hard John Cena fan. I would say this is the best ppv that the WWE has put out in a long time. I think turning over the belt to Edge will give them an idea if they have a legitimate top line performer asnd they did it without hurting Cena's credibility. Good stuff..."
1,EVERYONE,CENA LOST THE BELT OK. NOW SHUT UP YOU CENA HATERS AND WRITE SOMETHING NEW INSTEAD ABOUT HOW CENA SUCKS>
3,Kind of enjoyable.,Found it kind of enjoyable. But definitely not one of my top 30 cd to bring to a desert island. Unless you only have 40 cds. There are quite a bit of better ambient music out there really. When in the right time or mood it's fine.
2,"Noise, yes. Ambient or art, no.","Eeyucch. Sounds like being stuck waiting for someone in the lobby of a Vegas hotel while the housekeeping staff is cleaning up in the background. Oh look, isn't that Wayne Newton over there?"
2,"A classic, but more hoopla than this book deserves.","This book is ok. Not great. The thing I found most lacking in it is exercises and importantly, ANSWERS to exercises. The exercises that the book does contain are overly tedious for the point to be learned. The book shouldn't be used as a stand-alone text for a group-theory class; it lacks detailed development for many important ideas. More concrete examples are needed in the text to illustrate important concepts. Less text and more equations are needed!"
2,no worth buying it!!,"Just i would like to give some advice to those who wish to buy this book : think twice before you do it.The problem with this book is not that it is bad, what happens is that it doesnt fit to those you want to have a good theoretical approach to the problem. In fact if you just need it to pass your exam at the university it can really be helpful for it has ,to my mind, an intuitive approach. But if you need to have a deep knowledge about all the mathematical subtilities it isnt the right book (for instance if you want to understand molecular modelling). So,be careful, you may be disappointed with this book..."
1,One Terrible Book,"Perhaps for the typical chemist, who has incredible difficulty with arithmetic, this text is appealing and possibly useful, however for those of us who are theorists in this discipline, this book is terrible. It lacks precise definitions of mathematical objects, and contains way too many absolutely ridiculous ""brute force"" exercises that are worded ambiguously or better yet incorrectly.Additionally, this book is in NO way a substitute for a real algebra text and those chemists who are interested in learning the foundations of group theory and not just the theory of one particular group (i.e. the dihedral group) ought to purchase another book or sit in on an undergraduate course in abstract algebra. After doing so you will find that Cotton's text is a joke."
4,Bad expectations => Bad reviews,"So if you are a mathematician or a physicist, don't whine if this book isn't for you. It's for chemists, specifically inorganic ones, who use group theory to analyze ligand chemistry and spectroscopic measurements. It is also useful for those who utilize computational chemistry programs like Gaussian and need to know the basics of orbital and molecular symmetry.This book contains only point group symmetry and none of the SO, SU, U, etc. groups used in physics. There is also no coverage of Lie algebras."
3,Acceptable introduction to applied group theory.,"Cotton's text is infamous for its ease of use and many practical examples. It is ideal for the undergraduate or the chemist who needs only a cursory understanding of group theory. It will get one through the basics, but for serious students, the references contained therein are invaluable."
5,Good but hard,"Impossibly hard to understand at times, but overall a very good text to have for higher level undergrad or intro level graduate courses"
5,Rescue Hero Fan,"My son is a huge Rescue Hero fan. We have ""hero's"" all over the house, but this has to be my favorite vehicle for them. Both of my boys love to play with this. It makes fun sounds and is very durable. Two ""heros"" can ride at a time which solves whose ""hero"" gets to ride in the vehicle. Great Value!"
2,Defected toy,"I sent this to my grandson, who loved it. The frustrating thing is it never worked as advertised. We cannot get the action figures to inneract, therefore I consider it false advertising. He still loves playing with it but it should perform as advertised. This is our first experience with Resue Heros & it wasn't a good one."
5,Wow - Keep Up The Good Work,My 4 yr old DS loves this toy. It is a great investment and addition to his Rescue Heroes collection. This will be a keeper till he is all grown up. Finally a toy that keeps his attentiona and he willingly wants to play with it on his own.A must have for any little boy.
4,Cute toy,"My 3 year old son got this for Christmas, and being a Rescue Heroes lover, he was thrilled. He does have a bit of a problem getting the figures to fit into the car so that they talk, but he just plays with them without the talking feature. The ""handcuff"" on the front of the car is already starting to droop a bit and tends to pop out unexpectedly and randomly. This also hasn't been a huge deal because my son still pushes it around with the claw part out...so far, it hasn't seemed to get tangled in the wheels or anything. It is a bit loud, but not terribly annoying.All in all, this is a good toy for fans of Rescue Heroes."
3,Doesn't work on City Select,"This doesn't work on the City Select stroller. I love the idea, it isn't very big though.I don't know if the City Select is considered a single or double stroller as it can be both, but the Baby Jogger website says that it works with the City Select and on the outside of the box is says that it isn't compatible with the City Select."
3,CAN work with City Select Double with modification,"Unfortunately this ""universal"" cooler from BJ is not designed to work with their City Select model. I ordered it anyway and have found that if you are using the brackets for the 2nd seat attachment you can attach it backwards to those and the cooler bag will be stable, accessible and outside the storage basket. It's not the way it was designed but it works good enough.BJ really needs to modify the design to fit the City Select as it is an awesome stroller."
2,Glorified lunchbox,"I love every other product I have gotten from baby jogger, but I was disappointed in this cooler. It's about the size of a lunch box, but it really doesn't even function as well as a lunch box.. I couldn't get it strapped on securely, it kept falling forward. Maybe it was ""user error"" I don't know. Also, it needs artificial ice, regular ice will leak through the seams, which I suppose would be the case for most soft sided coolers, but that's something you'll need to consider with this purchase. I bought this to take on a family trip where we needed to keep an entire day worth of breast milk cold while museum hopping, and since I didn't have access to a freezer at the hotel, I planned on using ice from the machine. This did not do the trick."
4,Baby Jogger Cooler Bag,"This cooler bag is a nice addition to my City Mini. I honestly do not use it very often, I always forget it is there. But it is nice to store cold drinks and food. We used it a lot on vacation. I would bring the stroller down to the pool and store water and lunch in the cooler bag so we didn't have to go back to the room until the day was over :)"
2,Not impressed...,"The item I received is a baby jogger cooler bag, but it is not the same as the one pictured. Also, my bag came without any instructions so I attached it as best I could. Its very small. Im not convinced its worth having. And it does impede the folding somewhat. I was hopeful for some storage since the basket on the city mini itself is fairly worthless. Overall, I'm not impressed. This may be going back."
3,tiny. returned it.,"I think this would fit one sandwich, snack, small drink and small snack, and MAYBE a small ice pack. you might be able to squish one more thing of the list in. For the purpose I wanted it for, it was too small. I was looking for something bigger for Disneyland, but for an afternoon walk, it would be fine. It also looked complicated to install. Didn't try since i knew i was returning it. I'm just going to put a cooler bag in the basket of the stoller."
4,Film's Title Did it a Serious Injustice,"Apparently, when this film was named, Peter Weir, etc., either didn't mean for people to take it literally, or they DID mean it, and wanted to draw a larger crowd. But, if you're looking for a movie about killer cars that literally eat people in Paris, France, STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE.Now, for the rest of you, if you like quirky, dark comedies set in Australian small towns, this may be for you. The humor can be a bit esoteric for non-Australians, but the film has its universally good moments -- especially the powerful ending. It's too bad the title was misunderstood as humor, because the movie's not bad at all."
3,AN OK MOVIE,"THE CARS THAT ATE PARIS IS NOT A HORROR MOVIE. ITS REALLY ABOUT POOR PEOPLE IN PARIS, AUSTRALIA. THE WHOLE PLOT OF IT IS A FAMILY CAUSES CAR ACCIDENTS SO THEY CAN SELL THE CAR PARTS IN JUNKYARDS FOR CASH. THE SOUNDTRACK IS PRETTY GOOD FOR A B MOVIE AND THE PLOT IS ALRIGHT, BUT I RECCOMEND THIS MOVIE ONLY FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE BAD ACTING AND CORNY JOKES."
2,A colorful yet disappointing attempt to capture Doyle's idea,"The color and CGI's are excellent in this film. The location shots are great, and the attempt to capture the late 1880's successful. However, the female character is obnoxious and certainly un- becoming in attitude, language and appearance. While this might be the 90's, and women should be able to handle strong lead characters, this woman, who was the financial backer of the expedition, was disgusting. There have been several major cinematic attempts at this story, but this version leaves a lot to be desired."
2,"Everything's lost in this world, including the plot.","This was a really dissapointing remake of the great adventure story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It didn't really seem to follow the original novel other than the names of the lead characters. The plot and scripting are incredibly weak, it seems the editors just stopped mid-movie and rolled the credits there. The CGI dinosaurs' appearances were impressive but their animation was very stiff. In my opinion, not worth the $83 it costs."
3,This is NOT the movie you saw on TNT!,"This is a common misunderstanding. The version of ""The Lost World"" everyone saw on TNT is the pilot for the Television series that airs on WGN. This particular movie stars Patrick Bergin as Professor Challenger and the plateau setting is moved to Mongolia. The special effects are so-so and the acting is hoaky. A traditional B-Movie with a surprising amount of violence considering the classic story it's based on. Sort of a jungle set ""Carnosaur""."
4,The Lost World the best since the original,"This is the best movie based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's book The Lost World. I've seen all the other ones and this is got to be the best one right up there with the original 1925 version. The SFX are the best, just like the ones in Jurassic Park. And the acting is good too. If your a movie buff and want to spend money then this is the movie for you!"
5,A resource for retreat planners as well as participants...,"Jeannette Angell's ""All Ground is Holy"" is an excelent overview of the contemporary retreat experience. While the word 'retreat' has many different uses in many different contexts, the retreat experience described in detail is the classic Catholic retreat which might be experienced in a monastic setting. This well organized work gives a good overview of that experience and will be a comfort to those ready to embark on the first retreat of their spiritual journey.For those clergy and lay leaders of churches with no connection to the monastic tradition, this book will serve well as a planning guide and a resource for the orientation for participants.This book is written with clarity and brevity by one who has lived the experience of many retreats. It is a welcome addition to the literature on the topic."
5,Excellent Classic for Animal Lovers,"Have read 4 other of his books and somehow this got by me. After finally reading it, I have to compare it to all the others and I, being an animal lover, give it 5 stars. He tells it like it is and doesn't pull the punches. Yes, sometimes it is sad but other times, you will laugh your head off. Excellent story teller. If you love animals, this is for you.....all of them are."
5,Interesting,This book is not just for animal lovers. It is very entertaining and James Herriot writes with humor and has a great love of people.
4,all things wise and beautiful,"Visited an old friend, James Harriot Enjoyed the book as it was the only one of his I hadn't read.Have visited this area in Yorkshire in the past and really enjoyed it. Bought the book from Amazon.Always great service with them."
4,for those who love people and animals,the author is talented and humanistic. his acounts of life in the English Isles as a service man and veterinarian are beautifuly and wrenching told. there is humor pathos and beauty. much enjoyed.All Things Wise and Wonderful
5,Excellent story telling,"Since first reading James Herriot I was drawn to the richly told, heart-warming stories. The characters he details almost seem to become real in the reading. I have enjoyed each of the books from this series."
4,Outragest!!!!,This book is definetly funny. I especially liked it when Gary and Wally were in a compition of love.It was very humorus and tells about wisdom and kindness. I recomend it for ANY kid!!!!!
5,Great kids series!,"All the Wally McDoogle series are great reads to put before upper elementary kids' eyes. Wally, er, Bill Myers, has a wild imagination that he lets run free in this series! Each book addresses some problem or weakness pretty common to most of us, and then Myers has Wally take it to an extreme to make a point. Wally wants to be a writer, so part of each book is his writing a superhero story, usually science fiction, with events based on what just happened to him, only turning out the way he wished it had instead of reality. But even Wally's reality can be pretty far out. A large bully is after Wally at summer camp, and then he ends up in a canoe on a river with the guy, and they both learn lessons about fear, trust, and God. It is hard to turn the pages fast enough when you are laughing that hard!"
1,can't review something I never received,they've asked me to review something that hasn't come. that's a little tough. I ordered it over a month ago and it looks like it's supposed to come in antoehr month or so. we'll see
4,Buddha,I was working on a report for Buddhism so I got this book its a very informative book if you want to learn about buddhist festivals I must say this is the perfect book from even if you want to learn about Bhikkus or Mayanha monks
5,fine latch,"it is doing what it is supposed to do , and it is stainless steel , and simple construction helps keep it working for a long time , it could use a weaker spring , but it has plenty of adjustment length"
4,Susan is at war with the new neighbours,"This is the third Susan book. Susan comes home from boarding school with her cousins and finds that horrid spoilt children have moved in next door. Susan singes one eyebrow off in a gas explosion whilst ""helping"" a poor widow who is under threat of eviction from a wicked landlord. The cousins continually feud with the nasty neigbours, but all ends well of course."
5,Mesmorized by this Muppets video,"My child loves this video. She loves the nonstop song and dance routines. There's never a dull moment for her to get restless or bored by. It's lively, upbeat and wholesome fun. It's quite similar to an actual Muppet Show episode from TV."
1,Bad Start,This is not a zany (a word actually used to describe the book in a review) Florida mystery yarn filled with interesting characters. It tries to be but doesn't come close. The author thinks putting his characters in an interesting location is enough work and his job is done. As a result nothing very interesting happens and absolutely none of it is amusing. Can't believe the publisher came back for more.
5,Loved it,"Loved this book as well as Jamaica me....Low key excitmentA very fun read for the summer, orif you just love a warm climate tale!!"
2,Mediocre Mystery Novel,"I first read and enjoyed Bob Morris's mystery novel titled Jamaica Me Dead. So, I immediately purchased Bahamarama right after finishing Jamaica Me Dead in hopes that it was just as good.What a disappointment to say the least!!! I guessed who dunnit by page 140, which was less than halfway through Bahamarama... I've never read a mystery novel, where I guessed whodunnit and why so early on in the game. Also, the novel started out fun and fast paced with lots of action and very witty, but got boring in the middle partly due to the fact that I was bored cause I figured all out.The only redeeming features were the humor and that Zack Chasteen and his sidekick, Boggy, are likable characters."
1,Worst book I ever finished,"It's too late for me -- save yourselves. The best thing about the book is that it's short. The hero needs another dimension to be two dimensional. The style -- well, there isn't any. The author starts with a plot, drops it quickly and moves onto a long hiatus of boring description and a character with no emotional or intellectual depth. Shortly after a character introduction, I told my son I can't believe the coming twist would be so obvious and telegraphed. When a red herring is thrown in, it has ""Red Herring"" painted on its side. The author didn't believe it and neither will you.In the last dozen pages, the author returns to the opening plot and quickly resolves it. No suspension of disbelief is required, because there is no pretense of believability.My wife will attest to my low standards for thrillers of this sort. This book did not even rise that far."
4,Morris is Finally Hitting on all Cylinders,"While I've enjoyed (in a qualified way) the earlier installments in this series, I'd grown weary of the author's fondness for showy (and often poorly executed) plot twists rather than trusting his writing and his characters to pull the reader through the book. Well, I'm happy to say that this book breaks the pattern and is a solid and entertaining mystery read through-and-through.What we've got here is enjoyable characters, interesting locales, vicarious travel pleasures, and a narrative drive that will keep you popping chapters like potato-chips. An enjoyable beach read, even if (maybe even especially if) you don't have a beach handy."
3,Freshman novel sure to improve,"Bahamarama is another of the southeast based books amongst a sea of authors currently writing about Florida. Morris moves offshore into the Bahamas, however, providing us with a different locale in the same region. For me, this book lacked momentum but was still enjoyable enough to complete. There is no shifting of scenes as the entire book is viewed through Chasteen, a recent prison release. It's a straight forward day by day journey of the character as he seeks his missing girlfriend. It's not bad for a first book and I'm sure the author will improve in his next few books. I will give him another shot when his next one is out in paperback.This book could easily be turned into a comical movie along the lines of Big Trouble, Big Bounce, or Get Shorty. While I found the book to be in need of a kick, it's an enjoyable enough outing if you want to try a new author for your reading selections."
2,Cheap and Crappy!,"It is a horrible digital camera! It has terrible picture quality, and no LCD screen. 4 out of the 5 pictures I took on this camera came out blurry. Don't bother taking pictures in low lighting because they won't come out at all. It is a waste of money! It may be cheap but it's crappy!I will never, ever get an argus digital camera again! DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA! Do not ever buy a VGA Digital Camera, they are terrible! I hope I have convinced you not to buy the camera. If I were you, I would get a digital camera that is at least 2MP (Megapixels) or above."
4,Good and calm moments.,"The voice of Maireid Sullivan, the masters of Lunny, the uilleann pipe of Deegan, the support of Irvine, the band...All it makes of Dancer a great album.Recommendable."
5,Very Satisfied,Robe hook was exactly what I was looking for. Very nice brushed bronze robe hook which we plan to use for towels.
1,"Poorly made puzzle, impossible to complete","My adult daughter and I enjoy working an occasional jigsaw puzzle together, and this image looked like it would be pleasant. The puzzle pieces were incompletely cut, so that I had to pull them apart, and the cardboard backing tore and peeled. Every piece was able to fit into many other pieces, so it was impossible to say where it definitely belonged. After three days, we were not able to complete the border, and I could not put together the one figure in a distinctive costume. I not only quit, but recycled the puzzle so that no one else would suffer, trying to work it. I will never buy Clementoni again! So far, we have had great success with Pomegranate, Ravensburger, and Ricordi puzzles."
2,Be cautious!,"I subscribed to this magazine for my 9 YO because I thought it would be educational. But something tells me it's a scam. I paid for a year and have proof. They keep sending me bills and every time I call, they say their ""system is down"" so they can't verify payment. They threaten to stop the subscription unless it is paid. So basically I'm out $30 and my time for dinking around with this company. Buyer beware!"
5,The Simple Life of Noah Dearborn,"I love this CD movie purchased from Amazon.com because it is inspirational: a man, simple and in love with God's earth, inspite of the difficulties he experienced when he was a young man."
3,I was in this movie!,"Since I had a small role in this film I will comment as to what a good family film this is and what a super nice and down to earth person Sidney Poitier is. His performance in Noah Dearborn is very moving and real and while the supportig cast is wooden and could be interchangeable with anyone and the story is thin but pleasent, overall a good watching experience.Oh I was one of the Deputies that arrests him and later when Sidney knocks out a construction worker I am standing over his right shoulder as he delivers the best line of the film! I will never forget my three days on the set with Sidney and what he taught me about acting. He is one of the best ever on every level! Thanks again Sidney for what you told me."
3,"Interesting Story, Gotta Watch It Twice To Catch It All","A low budget film with an creative story line. Sidney Poitier nails the role (no pun intended) and captures both your heart and interest. Great family film, teaches lessons on the value of hard work, kindness, simple lifestyle, and caring about ones neighbors. A great film to watch with your children or grandchildren during the holidays."
5,THE SIMPLE LIFR OF NOAH DEARBORN,I HAD SEEN THIS SO I BOUGHT IT FOR A GIFT. I THINK HE WATCHED IT 6 OR 7 TIMES. WONDERFUL MOVIE.
2,Sidney Poitier only good thing about this,"Simplistic, hurried, unrealistic, script ruins this movie. It has that ""Made for TV"" feel about it. Sidney Poitier was the only element of this show worth 5-stars; however, the plot and other actors were so cheesy that dragged the rating down for me to a 2. Only 2 because of SP, if he weren't in it, it would be a 0!However, as the other reviewer stated, this may be a good film for kids to watch with the family. Kids like ""Barney"" and ""Pokeman"" for goodness sake, so they probably won't see the horrific flaws in this work."
5,Best Smooth Jazz CD Ever,"I purchased this album in Singapore 5 years ago at an HMV music store where it was the featured CD in their jazz section. It was then, and is now the finest Jazz CD I have ever heard. I gave a copy of it to the owner of a Jazz bar I frequent near Tokyo, and he plays it every Friday night. Amazingly popular with guests, and generally anybody that listens to it, it will make a smooth jazz lover out of anyone."
4,Nice mix,"These type of compliation / sampler albums are always a mixed bag, but this one is way above average. If you want to listen a blues asortment that does not really favor any particular style, this one is for you. Ronnie Earl, Charles Brown, Gatemouth Brown, etc, you can't go wrong."
3,We miss ya Big Poppa...,Only one video on here by Biggie and that song is Juicy. I rember when I first saw that video I saw the brothers doing chin ups on the lamp post on the corner I want outside and tried it! Word!
4,True Jazz Disciple,"This album really captures the energetic feel of the jazz greats who where the pioneers of this genre of music.This artist has proved his talent,love and dedication for this art form through his expression of the music and there is no doubt that he is a True Jazz Disciple."
4,Guitar From Ipanema,"This is an almost forgotten classic of unpretentious soft evening Brazilian mood music. Almeida near his best. A nice mix of instrumental tracks with a couple of songs song sung by an unknown (to me) silky smooth female vocalist that puts you in the heart of Rio on a warm summer night. The vocal songs evoke a classic small cabaret atmosphere and the guitar tracks are inspired versions of classic Brazilian songs. I've put this album on back when I got the old ""record"" from my brother-in-law and was always asked what album was playing and where did I get it. Nice way to unwind after a long day at work or a hard rock concert. Visualize a Rio penthouse overlooking the beach at night with a glass of champagne in your hand and you got it."
2,Not especially helpful with garnishing,"I agree with the other reviewer. While this is a lovely book, it was not what I was expecting or hoping for. I found it lacking in illustrations."
1,No illistrations,The book is ok there are no illistrations. it is all written and you have to figure it out for your self. Lots of mombo jumbo that is not nessary. Not what you would expect from the cover.
5,Outstanding read to book,"I have used the Mr. Men series for many years in the classroom. It was always a highlight for the children. I would read one each week, and they always looked forward to it."
5,Breathtaking!,"Thoughtful, brilliantly conceived and soulful, this is a great performance. Carter's passionate rendition of ""Strange Fruit"" will shock you. Jazz fans--especially those who lament the passing of The Giants--will be thrilled.James Carter has produced an unforgettable CD."
3,Wildly uneven recording,"James Carter has many ardent fans, I do not profess to be one of them. However, I am a huge fan of the saxophone and because of it do have a couple of Carter's recordings in my collection. While he can play some beautiful music, too often he resorts to pyrotechnics instead of going for substance. Such is the case on half of the music on this disc. If you are into the avant-garde then you will probably like this CD. However, if you are more into melodies and mood, then wait until you get a real good deal on ""Gardenias"" - that way getting only 50% of good music will not disappoint as much."
5,Awesome Sacramento Band!!,Wow these guys are amazing. There's only 3 of them and they fill out their sound as much as any 4 or 5 piece band. Each one of them is a top player and combined you get some great tunes...
1,Sugar And Spice With Nothing Nice ...,"A quick review for those of you who dont like reading paragraphs and paragraphs of information. This movie was probably one of the worst I have seen. I saw this when I was bored and I had heard some funny things about it so I clicked on it and I was rather surprised. There were a few funny things but nothing special, the plot was horrible, it was inaproppiate, and the movie felt like it took forever to actaully get started and then actually finish.Overall: Dont even bother. You'll probably fall asleep before it gets to the climax or you'll be talking through it or the occasional few who would watch it in shock and say, ""that was horrible."""
5,Awsomeness,"This was an awsome movie. It has been on direct TV lately and I find myself watching it every time it is on. Unfortunately, they are not playing it anymore so I have to buy it for myself! It is a funny film that keeps you watching. I would definately reccommend it!"
5,James Marsden saved the film,"The movie would be average without James Marsden. Considering that he was 26, he played the role of a lunkheaded high school jock so delightfully well. What makes James Marsden such a great actor is that he can play different roles so very well: a bullish brother (No Dessert Dad till you Mow the Lawn), a violently troubled teenager (On the Edge of Innocence), a ruthless mafia hit man (Bella Mafia), a detached high school outcast (Disturbing Behavior), a comic superhero (X-Men), a liar and rapist college student (Gossip), a boyish lawyer (Ally McBeal).He saved the movie. James Marsden's heart stopping good looks and incredible talent make him the best in Hollywood's history. Watch for his upcoming new movies: Interstate 60, X2, The 24th Day, The Preacher..."
2,an OKAY movie,"This movie did have SOME funny parts. I believe that all the girls in this movie did a good performance. I must admit though, I was really disturbed by the ""virgin betty"". I am a christian and this movie poked fun at god TOO MANY TIMES! I think It is VERY sad that our socitey finds making fun of our creator funny. so if you believe in god DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE."
1,Pure Horror,"This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever experienced in my life. I mean it is terrible, even worse than ""Charlies Angels."" I really don't know why I even wasted an hour and a half of my life on this work of trash. Why oh why does hollywood keep doing this to us. There isn't anybody in their right mind that should enjoy this movie. In the bottom 50 of all time."
3,"Bizarre, all right movie that's good for a few laughs","Sure, the satire falls a little flat, and most of the comedic timing is off, but there are still a couple of bits in it that are pretty funny. Would make a pretty good rental on a slow night."
2,"Just watch ""Bring It On"" instead","One of the most bizzare movies I've ever seen, full of not-really-funny jokes where you're not really sure if you should laugh or be offended.The characters are all complete stereotypes, i.e. the goody-goody church girl, the bad seed, etc. They all seem incredibly self-absorbed and are rather irritating. The development of some of them isn't done very well, for example Mena Suvari's character doesn't speak until about 20 minutes in, despite lurking in the background almost from the start.It's easy to see why Bring It On won the battle of cheerleader comedies when both film were released."
1,Terrible.Waste of time!,"The movie just came out Jan.27 2001, and it is a stinker! It is totally uninteresting, and corny as possibly could be. The actors seem to just smile a lot, the script could be written on a napkin, and probably was, audiences were disgusted, James Marsden is as bad as he has ever been. Save your money. This one isn't worth watching ."
3,More Fun Than It Should Be,"This film was actually a lot better than I thought it would be. That does not mean that this film belongs on the AFI's Top 100, but it does mean that it is pretty good fluffy, rainy day entertaiment. The women look good, and they are so cheery and ready to please that it becomes infectious. Plus there is some genuinely sharp dialouge here. Overall, I'm more than happy to give this piece of throwaway entertainment 3 stars."
3,uh...,"the movie has potential, but doesn't quite follow through. it was too ""sugary"" and not nearly ""spicy"" enough."
2,Seems funny but mostly amauterish.,"Sugar and Spice is a silly dark comedy but the cast does bring some marginal life to this film especially James Mardsen and Marley Shelton. Mena Suvari plays a cheerleader again! What's with this girl? get some range. Marla Sokoloff does her best b!%&h impression but the premise is pretty lame, these girls will do anything to get out of a bad situation, even rob a grocery store. The only thing I liked about this movie was the music, I regret watching this choppy mess."
4,Not Another Teeny Bopper Movie,"This movie surprised me. I expected something like She's All That, one of the better teen movies (to me)...or maybe something less than that. But this movie was not what I expected. It was fresh and funny! It made references to John Cougar Mellancamp and the storyline was unusual, absurb, and it worked. Good comedy. Not on my top ten list, but worth a viewing, in my book."
2,Low Grade Teen Flick,"A pretty low point in the teen movie genre is this ridiculous film about four high school cheerleaders who decide to rob a supermarket bank when one of the girls (Marley Shelton) gets pregnant and married and can't afford to live on husband James Marsden's video store salary. Their plans to pull off a successful robbery and getaway seem pretty smooth until cheerleader-wannabe Marla Sokoloff shows up and threatens to throw a wrench in the whole thing. Most of it is uninspired, and the messages about giving teens more opportunities to better run their lives is wasted in this films' irresponsible attitude. Oddly enough, Mena Suvari is for once left in the background, a real shame considering she's much more interesting in this film than I'm used to her being."
3,If I could give it 2.5 starz I would. But I rounded it up.,"You would think that a movie staring Rachel Blanchard (Road Trip) & Mena Suvari (American Pie) would be a whole lot better than this one was. It was a little funny, but you know. It was so boring! The movie is basically about a young ""perky"" teenage girl who's a virgin & then finds ""Mr. Right"" and screws him & gets pregnant. She & her fellow cheerleader buddies (Or whatever you wanna call them) decide to rob a bank to help get her a nice house & to have plenty of money to support the baby. If you see the trailer, you basically saw the whole movie. The price for this DVD/VHS is outrageous! Go rent it. See how you like it. It's not that good, period."
2,"Snakes, Snails & Puppy Dog Tails....","Is that how it goes?? Honestly....go out and buy ""Bring It On"". I bought ""Sugar and Spice"" after seeing ""Bring It On"" and realized this is one of those times when movies come out in pairs...two new movies with cheerleaders...and one is far better than the other...example...The Matrix & The Thirteenth Floor...one sucks...one's good...you know the one.I laughed once while watching ""Sugar and Spice"", but skip this one. There were so many great possibilities and directions for this movie to go, but it just swirled and swirled down the drain."
5,When you first see the movie box you think stupid chick flick,"This was a genuinely smart,funny,and un-realistic view of teenage desperation in a time of need in this case a pregnant cheerleader.A great film to watch."
2,nah-uh,with cheerleaders robbing banks..one gets pregnant..marries James Marsden(whos funny as a goofball) and then basically thats it....nothing much then that.....fun for awhile then drops dead. note: Adam Busch(billed as Geeky Guy) goes on to play Warren Mears on Buffy The Vampire Slayer for all you Buffy fans out there
1,sugar and spice anything but nice,"never before in my many years of watching movies has a film made me physically cringe.My refrigerator has more talent and charisma than this movie displayed.This film is proof that Britany Spears should never seek an acting career because if she did,we would see more films like these.Cheerleaders all over the country should feel strongly insulted about how this movie depicts them.Just when you thought Battlefield Earth was the worst film you ever saw, nothing could prepare you for this abomination.No sugar,no spice,no talent,no humor,no nothing!"
4,"Good, but get the longer Mega strap","It's too bad I did not see the sizes for Neotech straps before I ordered this one. This strap is very comfortable and will allow me more playing time with my 10+ lbs bass. However, this strap (Super Bass Strap) is quite short at 42"" max. I'm 5'8"" of medium built and don't prefer to play particularly low, but this strap really places my bass too high up my chest. I haven't tried theNeotech Mega Bass Strap, but I think this other Neotech strap is well worth the $10 difference. I'm not sure if the Mega is wider or narrower, but the Mega Bass Strap offers much more length at 51"" max. I wish I could swap mine, but I'm not in the US.Anyway, this and other Neotech straps are well worth their prices. They are very well made, plus they will save your shoulder and your back. However, you have to get them at the right size. Too bad this information is not made very obvious by Amazon or even the Neotech site."
3,"Great product, perhaps not so accurate description","This was almost the strap I thought I needed.. I didn't know there were 2 distinct models of this strap from Neotech. It's great, built well etc.. but make sure you confirm the length before you buy. This one happens to be at least 6"" too short for my needs."
3,Pretty good for not being Disney,"I was scared but I bought it anyway, even though I hadn't yet seen the movie. The music is actually pretty good, especially Steve Perry's ""I stand alone"" and Celine Dion's ""prayer."" The rest of it ain't half bad either if you can stomach the animation-type. Not quite Disney, but still pretty good!!!"
5,Great!,"I saw Quest for Camelot, the movie and loved it. I heard the soundtrack and loved it. ALl the songs on there were excellent. A must buy. It has inspired me alot."
5,"This is an incredible CD, unexpected production from Warner.",I saw the movie. It is a great movie. But the music is what strikes me. I would have never expected Warner Brothers to produce such a vibrant movie with awesome high-quality music and soundtrack. A must buy.
5,"To touch the heart, and make it sing. This CD does just that","The beauty of the song, ""Looking Through Your Eyes"" brings to light the simple truth that when one is truly in love...they see through the eyes of the one they love. Very well written songs and the artists are truly at their best here."
4,"Steve Perry, number one!!! Januari 99","I'm a big fan of Steve Perry so when I ""heard"" that he was on this soundtrack, I just had to order it from USA. I couldn't wait until it reach the stores in Sweden. And I find out that there where some other great artist and songs to."
4,Absolutely Charming!,"Here it is, almost 2005, and I just found this movie and the MUSIC from it. The movie itself is truly charming, with the musical score adding so much to it. Granted the instrumental was tedious, but thankfully not a lot of instrumental work! Steve Perry's rendition was fabulous, Bryan White (and even Celine Dion) were all great. The music really helped make the movie even more entertaining, especially the songs by Idle and Rickles...they were hilarious! In the movie (where they played a dinosaur with 2 heads"
3,Okay.,"This was an okay CD. To tell you the truth I was realy disapointed because most of these songs don't make sense unless you watch them on the movie. If you want to get this CD that's fine, I didn't say I don't like. I think it's okay, but be warned. Unless you see the movie this might not be much use to you."
2,Warner Brothers should stick to shorts!,"At least if this movie and its music are any indication, Warner Brothers should stay out of the feature business and just do what it does best - TV. The songs are flat and uninspiring, and I can't stand Garrett's voice. And why did they have to jump on the Celine Dion/LeeAnn Rimes bandwagon?! I think Warner Brothers could have made a better movie and a better soundtrack had they worked on it a little longer and spent some more money. They were obviously looking for tuneful, memorable songs, but Quest for Camelot misses the mark. Don't see the film, don't buy the CD."
5,The greattes soundtrack of 1998,"The greattest songs ever written in 1998 came from the movie Quest For Camelot. With a touch of comedy and romance, the soundtrack brings as many laughs and smiles as the movie does. With a touch of the greattest songwritting ever, this soundtrack is really #1."
5,download is cheaper,This is truly a great soundtrack but the price is too high. Go to gomusic.ru and you can download it for $1.76.
5,"Robin, Maurice, Barry Gibb","How the BEATLES are revered for their musical genius, and given credit for changing music in the last century. Make no mistake about it they were great.However I take issue with the BEATLES being on another plane from other recording artist in their time. The BEE GEE's are just as good and in some cases much better.You have to realize that BARRy GIBB wrote for many different artist. His collaboration with Barbara Streisand in the 1980's Classic CD ""GUILTY"" is probably one of the greatest CD's ever recorded. He revived Dionne Warwick career in the 80's with HEART BREAKER and who can forget Parton & Rogers Duet on ""ISLANDS in the STREAM"" ???I'll put ""How do you mend broken Heart"" or ""Words"" ""The First of May"" ""I Started A Joke"" with anything the Beatles ever did.If you think the Beatles were better, just over it !!"
4,Only way to get many obscure singles and B-sides on CD,"This is a pretty good survey of the Bee Gees career, beginning with their amazing British releases of 1967, through their lucrative ""disco"" period, and well into their mature years. In addition to all the popular hits, it includes a smattering of the better LP tracks, as well as most of the non-LP singles and B-sides, including little-known gems like ""Barker of the UFO"" and the sublime ""Sinking Ships."". The only glaring omission is ""Rest Your Love On Me"", the gorgeous CW-flavored B-side of ""Too Much Heaven"". Sound quality is uniformly excellent.If you like the Bee Gees and want a really exhaustive collection of their hits, look no further. But I recommend that you also check out their complete albums, especially the ones from the '60s. All are currently available on bargain CDs. If you like the singles from that period, you'll surely be delighted by the LPs."
3,Some great Some mediocre Some terrible,"Overall a solid collection which could have been great but with a few very severe missteps. Don't really like their disco period but disc 3 is a good representation of the best songs from that period. Disc 1 and 2 are awesome except for a couple of really really really terrible songs -- Country Woman and On Time are the worst songs I've ever heard -- ugh!!!!!!! Unfortuantely they totally ruin the second disc. Disc 4 is ok -- would have preferred to have more songs from Living Eyes, ESP and One instead of the horrible Live Medley which ruins the disc. Where is Living Eyes? Toys is HORRIBLE!"
3,a must for EARLY bee gees fans,"I absolutely LOVE the work the bee gees did from 1967 - 1973. Gloriously orchestral pop on par with the Beatles and the Left Banke. The post-1974 stuff however... well let's just say I like to call it aural vomit.That said, this box set is a MUST for any fans of the pre-disco B.G.'s, as it contains many songs from that period that were never released on albums (""Jumbo"", ""Sinking Ships"", ""Singer Sang His Song"", etc.). In fact aside from the original 45's, I think this box set is the only place you can get these songs.So for any fans of brilliant albums like ""Horizontal"" or ""Odessa"", this box set is pricey but it is essential. Find a used copy somewhere!"
5,Wonderful,It is a wonderful compliation of the Brothers Gibb. I have enjoyed listening to it over and over. I also find the book that comes with it very interesting. I really like the comments made by the brothers about the songs. Also great pictures that I have not seen before.
3,Buy it if you're new to the game.,"I was so excited about this book. I am a HUGE fan of the Idiot's Guides. Most of the info here was pretty much things I already knew about dreams. Chapters I did find interesting were the Color chapter AND the modes of sleep. If I had purchased this 10 years ago when I was just on the journey of Dream Interpretation, I would have loved this book. So, I say--buy it if you're new to the game.. otherwise, you'll have to do some more searching."
2,Who's the idiot?,"You don't have to be much above an idiot to see the bias contained in the book, which is inappropriate for a subject as abstract as dreaming. I was looking for a book on the basics; not a book on subtly disguised polemics, couched in terms and examples that are stringently politically correct. Enough already with marketing Jimmy Carter as a sympathetic, capable hero-type! This work had more the flavor of a feminiest manifesto than a fundamental treatise on the subconscious."
3,For Babyboomers,I'm over 70 and that is a disadvantage for me to give this album a better true evaluation. So take this rate accordingly. its probably very very good for yhe younger set. This is just my thoughts. good Luck!! to all. I have some of hers I love!!!!!
1,One of the worst albums of all time!,"LeAnn Rimes is the worst singer of all time and it shows on this poor excuse for an album. How many remakes is this girl going to do? She butchers songs formerly recorded by Prince, Jann Arden and Amanda Marshall. I think this album is the end of her career.She is losing fans and critics dislike her as well. Do not buy this album"
1,Ew,Please quit emailing me reminders that you now have this adultress' c.d. available. I'll never buy any of her music again. Thank you.
2,It is an absolutely beautiful cd.,I have the cd and I would recammend it to any one who likes country/contemporary anything. Le Ann has a beautiful voice and the music soothes one minute and gets you upbeat a raring to go the next. There is alot of emotion in this cd and you can hear it through her voice.
2,The worst thing about this album is LeAnn's VOICE,"As the subject line says, the worst thing about LeAnn's album is her voice. She would make the songs sound so much better if she just stopped YELLING and started singing. Her voice is forced out of her throat, making it sound too loud and unnatural. The melodies of the songs are actually pretty good...except for the ballads. The upbeat songs are the best ones, while the ballads are not listenable. It's just that LeAnn's voice ruins them. I hope the way her voice sounded on this album isn't going to be the way it sounds on her future albums."
5,IT WAS AWESOME!!!!,IT WAS REALLY A GOOD CD BUT SERIOUSLY I AM A HUGE FAN BUT SHE REALLY NEEDS TO USE SOME OF HER OWN SONGS!!!!!
1,It's not really music,"Most of this album is bad, and the rest is really bad. The voice, the songs, and the way she sings them are all medicore and I am amazed that it can be called music. It would be a mistake to buy this CD."
3,Devoted Fan-Disappointed,"I have faithfully bought all of LeAnn Rimes' albums as she has released them, and I will admit that at one point ""Sittin' On Top of the World"" was my favorite CD, but now I realize, this girl needs less remakes, and more original stuff. If she's not careful, she's going to fade into the background like any other ordinary teen idol. She has a fantastic voice, but she needs to go back to original things. Why does she think we all liked ""Blue"" so much? ""Blue"" was an original single, not a remake! LeAnn, please, where's that sweet little country girl with the big voice we all once knew and loved? Unless you are a die hard fan like me, I wouldn't really recommend this album."
1,just okay,"I've been a huge fan of Leann Rimes ever since she came out with One Way Ticket, but I really don't like this cd. I felt like it was a waste of my money. The only songs that I ended up liking was commitment and looking through your eyes. Commitment was pop/country and looking through your eyes leans more towards adult contemporary/pop.The rest of the songs seem to be a mix of old & contemporary country, it didn't have much pop in them so its not something that really interested me much because I'm more into pop/country. I was also disappointed with the fact that there are no lyrics listed on any of the songs."
1,An awful CD,"I liked some of LeAnn's earlier work so I listened to this album with high hopes. However, after the first few songs I was dissapointed. The album doesn't sound like LeAnn and some of the songs are too horrible to even think about. LeAnn doesn't write her own songs and she sings loudly too often, she doesn't use restraint. Do not buy this album!"
1,CD should never have been released,"LeAnn Rimes should have found better songs before releasing this CD. The songs are boring and forgettable and the song ""Purple Rain"" is paticulary bad. I can't recomend this album for anything except the trash heap."
1,"LeAnn lovers, get a life!","I am not a LeAnn hater. She has a beautiful voice, but she should write her own songs instead of going around looking for song that aren't legally protected. My opinion is that LeAnn lovers should get a life."
2,Disappointing...,This album is not near as good as I expected it to be. She needs to get some original material. She's got a voice for the kind of hard core country like in Blue but she wondered away from that track trying to do stuff that her voice is not fit for. Keep trying LeAnn...you're forgetting your roots.
1,LEANN RIMES COULD OF DONE BETTER!!!,I think LeAnn has a good voice BUT you wouldn't know it in this album! This album had a poor taste in selection of songs along with her doing a horrible job at singing them! I was VERY disappointed in this album!! I felt like she was trying for something different in this album but boy did she failed! You can tell she's young and still not sure of what type of sound she wants. This album is not anything to brag about or to waste your money on!!!
2,This album doesn't do her voice justice,"LeAnn sings with a clarity and range in her voice that has not been heard in quite a while in country. But her emotions definitely come through the most on traditional songs, like the terrific ""Blue."" Instead, though, LeAnn's album includes too many boring pop songs and errors in her choices of remakes. The whole album is very overproduced, and the only good original songs are ""These Arms Of Mine,"" ""Nothing New Under The Moon,"" and ""Rock Me."" Too many annoying echoes are heard, also. It's not that the remakes are bad songs, but the original artists like Prince use more appropriate arrangements and have more appropriate voices for them. For the most part, the lyrics on the album have gotten worse compared to her album Blue. I would only recommend buying this album if you are a determined fan."
3,Didn't like it as much as I thought I would,"I became a fan of Leann's when I bought ""Blue"" and I bought all her albums, though not in the order of release. When I bought this one and listened to it, I didn't really like it that much. I have to admit that I have only listened to this from beginning to end only twice. Also, the number of songs(15) is a little too long for me."
2,Bad album,"I don't care if LeAnn chooses to mix genres in this album. I don't care which songs are pop and which are country. The point is, her voice is terrible, which makes the songs sound awful. The melodies in the ballads are boring, although the upbeat songs aren't as bad. But she forces her voice to belt out the songs, which sounds unnatural. LeAnn Rimes is going downhill. Each album has gotten worse. Hopefully, she can redeem herself with her next album. Hopefully, her voice would have improved by then."
1,sittin on top of the world and smothering it,"Does she ever stop? I mean, she could scar children for life. Calling her a country singer totally disses country music. If pop wants her, they can have her. She sounds like a wounded animal that needs to be put out of their misery. And does she think of any songs on her own? Or will she continue to discrace other singers by redoing their songs with her horrible voice. I pity those who like her singing, for they do not know true music, but only yelling, bloodcurdling screeches that come out of Leann's um...voice?box."
3,Too many songs and ultimately uneven,"Aptly titled, when this album was released in May 1998 LeAnn WAS on top of the world. This marked her first album of new material really since her debut BLUE in 1996. In 1997 they released the EARLY YEARS cd as well as the Christian album YOU LIGHT UP MY LIFE. Unfortunately, this album is fairly uneven. Perhaps one of the worst covers, and I'm not sure who told her it was a good idea, but she covered Prince's ""Purple Rain"". She also covers Jann Arden's ""Insensitive"", while LeAnn has a nice voice, in 1998 her voice lacked the depth and emotion that the song calls for in order for it to sound convincing. There's some good songs, like the first single ""Commitment"", the single ""Nothin New Under The Moon"", and songs like ""Surrender"", ""The Heart Never Forgets"", ""Looking Through Your Eyes"", ""Feels Like Home"", and a few others, but ultimately, the album drags with too many songs, many of which are filler tracks."
3,Okay,"I consider this the true sophmore album to Leann's absolutly stunning first album, 'Blue.' The fact that this album is not a country album is not the real problem here. What is, is the arrangments on many of the AC numbers are bland, and are made even more noticeable when you compare to the country numbers that are also on this album. Also, I like to know whose idea it was to magnify LeAnn's voice, she dosen't need it, the girl can sing on her own, and the echo gets annoying on some songs, because it drowns out her voice. If you like LeAnn than I say buy this album, it's not a bad album, though it's not great, but there are some songs that are worth the price.These Arms of MineMore Than Anyone DeservesWhen am I Gonna get Over You- W/Bryan WhiteAll the Lovin' and the Hurtin'"
5,"LeAnn's the GREATEST and she's ""Sittin' on Top of the World""","I got this CD for my birthday. (I have all of LeAnn's others) I absolutely LOVED every single song the moment I heard them. LeAnn has a better singing voice and is much more mature than a lot of older singers, like Mariah Carey and Celine Dion. I was just at a concert of LeAnn's, and she had an even more beautiful voice there than on her CDs. She is so talented, and it shows in how she sings, looks, and acts, especially on this CD. (It really expresses her immense singing talent.) If you love LeAnn Rimes, or even just sort of like her, this CD is for you. LeAnn's newest CD, ""Sittin' on Top of the World"" will make anyone want to be and feel like they are.(If anyone has any comments on my review, E-mail me at the address listed. I'd love to hear from people, especially other LeAnn lovers like myself!!) :)"
5,I like this C-D because I like her sing her voice is good,I Like this C-D because I heard it on tv and then allI watch now is CMT
2,Genre Wanderer or Crossover Artist?,"Even though this album displays Rimes' impressive range, it lacks the charm she presented with ""Blue"". ""When Am I Gonna Get Over You"" is by far the only decent song on the entire album. Even though I've never heard Prince's version of ""Purple Rain"", I'm sure she suceeded in destroying the song's atmosphere. I have been very disappointed with LeAnn's constant crossing from the pop world to the country, and agree with those critics who hold a low opinion of this album."
4,Great album!!,"I really like this cd except for one song, Purple Rain. This is my favorite Prince song, but Leann did not do a very good job covering it. But, except for this one song, all the others are great! I hope she continues with her pop/country music trend."
2,Disappointing,"I really expected a better album. The cut ""Commitment"" is, sadly, a reflection of today's noise. Over driven BASS leaves it with most ""country"" music today - NOT. The last cut isn't even worth mentioning.Unfortunetly, this young lady will probably burn out before her time. Way to go dad!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Blllluuuueeee for listening to this cd,"Please someone make this girl stop. It is a sad day when someone gets a recording contract and never writes her own songs. Rhimes complete lack of originality or talent should cause her record sales to go down. For some reason people continue to buy her cds. If I had a choice of being injected with the flu or listening to this disc, I could always get over the flu but the shock of listening to Leann Rhimes could last for a long time."
3,"It's got some good songs, but it doesn't top Blue.","The first song is the driving single ""Commitment."" It's a great song and there are other great songs on this CD like ""Nothin' New Under The Moon"" and ""When Am I Gonna Get Over You."" LeAnn picked out good material. I'll give her that. But the production job was awful. Wilber(father/producer) magnified her voice. Anyone who knows LeAnn knows that her voice DOES NOT NEED TO BE MAGNIFIED! Then the electric guitar solos blar in and for first time listeners, it jars you. He has her singing every song at full voice. Some songs need to be sung that way, but not every single one. It's decent, don't get me wrong. It takes a while to grow on you. But it doesn't top her first, and best album ""Blue."""
2,I&#65533;m obviously not a fan of this girl.,"How disappointing. And why did she decide to attempt Prince's ""Purple Rain"" on a so-called ""country-pop"" album? Gimme a break, man! If she liked them songs so damned much, she should release a 100% pop album. I never heard how her father's production on the album sounds, but from what I heard, it's pointless."
3,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...],"This was probably the best written out of all of the Children of the Corn movies, however it really didn't fit with the storyline. First of all, there weren't any children in it, (except for Issac) there weren't any recurring characters, and there was even a steamy sex scene?! It was entertaining and very well written, but it wasn't your typical Children of The Corn movie. I have to admit, I was kind of disappointed."
1,Children of the Corn 666,I am extremely disappointed in the product I received. This movie does not play no matter what computer or device I tried it in. It is unreadable disc. I will not purchase from this provider again.
1,Stinks like garbage,It didnt have enough deaths in the film and i still dont understand how they make 6 films that are so alike and they all stink like a pile of junk.
1,Another reason to hate Hollywood,"The first one [was not very good], and from there on they some how got the idea to make sequel after sequel until it got so blown out of proportion that it makes you want to vomit. I swear this movie is terrible, slow, boring, and pointless.If it weren't for the fact that I am very liberal with the way I view movies I would never of have picked this up. Here is the basic idea, the children form the first are grown up. In the mean time the daughter of one of the origional children returns to find her birth mother. The birth Mother is played by Nancy Allen for a whole 15 20 minutes. Issac also returns to raise hell. There is a new prophecy, the first son and the first daughter of the origional children will mate and then he who walks behind the rows will be reborn. Yes it is that dumb sounding and that's what they made...."
1,So Bad It's Almost Good,"It is astonishing that a weak film like the original ""Children of the Corn"" could be followed by so many dreadful sequels, the very worst of which is this one. In desperation, the producers decided to revive the character of Isaac. The former child actor John Franklin, still short (but MUCH older) turns in one of the lousiest performances in the annals of cinema, looking a great deal like a wizened old elf, and babbling the sort of silly lines which are typical of this sort of third-rate junk. This is a horrible film, not a horror film. It's time to plow that cornfield under, and request government subsidies; this ""corn"" is rotten!"
3,It could have been better,I love and respect John Franklin.I'm glad he made a come back in this movie.But I have to be honest this movie could have been better.It starts of with some girl name Hannah who is looking for her birth mother back in Gatlin.She walks into a hospital where she finds Isaac in a 19 year old comma.Her touch awakens him.From there Isaac tries to finish what he began in the first COTC movie.I don't want to spoil the whole movie and give out the ending to those who have not seen it.But I will say that the only action parts are the scenes where Isaac(John Franklin)is in.Like I said before I love and respect John Franklin but this movie could have been better.
4,A Pleasing Sequel,"This, was a remarkable sequel. With dazziling performances. There, was some things in the movie, that did not relate. And, not everything could be understood. But, it showed spirit, and Issac's terrible return. This should of been, part 2. Not 6. It was about time Issac showed up...."
2,So...sad,"I rented this movie with expectations of a follow up to children of the corn 5 (which was a decent sequel), only to find a stupid and pointless plot. CHildren of the corn 1-3 were good movies, then 4 spoiled everything. And 5 started to reconcile the series...but 6 just squashed it down. Don't bother with 6, just hope that 7 will be a more of the 1-3 type of a movie. Children of the corn 7 : the reserection is being filmed in canada i have my doubts..since they cant reserect isaac again. blah!"
2,first COTC for me,"thiz iz the first COTC that i saw, and i didnt understand it and didnt like it. first, didnt know who Isaac was. There is nothing much to say about thiz film, itz just plain boring."
2,Disappointed,"In person, the earrings look kind of like sperm, and they don't hang nicely. They twist, so the faces are in back. Also, they are on the heavier side and are uncomfortable for people with sensitive ears. I'm thinking of reworking them into a necklace or something."
3,It's too expensive,"It's interesting, but the information is not enought for the price. I expect a deep explanation for those questions maybe some samples."
1,Skims the surface and poorly written.,This book is expensive for what it offers. Should have been proof read for spelling errors. Even the Index in the back will occasionally list the wrong page number. It seems to have been rushed to market without thought.
3,Good for a quick read.....,Its a slim volume with select questions on each area of ABAP. This would be the book I would choose to go through at the end of my preparation before the interview / exam.
1,Total waste of money and time,"My first reaction after going through the book was of total disbelief.To be frank,the reviews about the book made me buy it,a decision i regret now.There are simply not enough questions to cover the topics and the price for which is astronomous.A small advice for people buying this book - It is not worth spending that money and time.ThanksRanga"
1,SAP ABAP Certification Review,Save your money. This book is not worth the price and is not a good prep book for certification exam. I read it the evening before exam. Added little value and I passed.
5,SAP ABAP Interview Questions - No fluff,"This book focuses on the on details that you need to know for SAP ABAP and technical interview and certification. True, this is not ""ABAP Objects"" by SAP Press - so if you are looking for a textbook or volumes of information then this is not the book for you. If you're looking for a concise guide to the most important aspects of SAP ABAP, then this is your book.Many consultants are against these sorts of books since it raises the bar for interviews -- but the cat is out of the bag, and if you want to remain competitive in this global marketplace you need to be armed with knowledge. The above reviewer is obviously bogus (Gary Coleman?) and has a personal vendetta against the publisher since he didn't publish this book first. This book is one of a kind and is written by the best author in the industry."
5,"It's Working, I Guess.",How do you know if you got a bad air filter? I do know I've put about 8000 miles on this filter & my engine still runs fine. I believe it as good as more expensive filters made by companies that spend $$$ on advertising.
3,Track assignments incorrect for mp3 downloads,"I used to work at a ""Music of Your Life"" radio station and every Christmas season the cartridges with the holiday standards would come out. Hands down, Vikki Carr had the best version of ""What Child Is This"". It's good to see it on this compilation but the track listings are incorrect. Listen to the sample of track #5 which claims to be the hideous Robert Goulet and you'll find that it's Vikki Carr. I confirmed this with a download. The problem is easily remedied by editing the mp3 file properties to reflect the correct song title and artist name. As for the rest of the collection I can't really comment, I just raided it for the one song download."
3,not quite as pictured,"This charm fits the size description but when you actually see it in person, the diamonds are just specks in the charm and not at all how they appear to be in the photo. I'm glad I only paid a cheap price for it or I would have sent it back."
4,Enjoyable reading lots of facts,I was pleased to see that in this book there was a lot of talk about my hometown Paducah Ky where Grant came and occupied the city and wrote a letter to the citizens that he was here to liberate them not to occupy them. I enjoyed this book. This is the 19th book on an American President I've read.
2,Poorly Written,"The author expresses his opinions, just like the news media does. I bought this book for its value as a history book. I am not particularly fond of reading the authors slanted opinions. Not a good read for me!"
5,Wonderful but sad.,This is a truly wonderful documentary.It shows the ever increasing strain that wildlife is under around the world.Nice bluray transfer.
5,Nature: Broken Tail...A Tiger's Last Journery.,"LOVE anything on TIGERS, especially knowing that our World is killing them off rapidly! This visual CD is soooo real, as if this educator was there in person!"
4,I love this thing!,"This is a wonderful little gadget that produces a nice thick foam. It can get a little messy, as froth tends to seep out a little from the top, but a little cleanup is well worth the result!"
1,3 hours I will never get back.,"What a hunk of junk. Really. This sad remake should be forgotten immediately. It is an insult to the memory of Irwin Allen (the producer of the 1972 film) and Paul Gallico (the author of the 1969 novel).Since this was made for TV (by Hallmark no less), I guess I shouldn't have expected anything great. But this is BAD. The writing is horrific and the performances are some of the worst ever.I do believe ""The Poseidon Adventure"" would benefit from an updated version. And with Wolfgang Petersen - the master of the sea epic - at the helm, the big screen version due out in May of 2006 (titled ""Poseidon"") is the remake I am looking forward to.But this 2005 version starring D-list has beens should not be viewed. I will never get those 3 hours back. Don't make the same mistake."
5,wow,This may not be the best version of this story but the wide variety of cast members and the entertainment value cannot be underestimated.
3,Not better then the original,"I saw this movie on tv on NBC then i got it on dvd in a box set with other Hallmark movies. I like that it was a remake a fresh take on the movie. What I didn't like was that it was not like Poseidon Warner Brothers came out with. It was a direct remake of the original. They only changed how the characters were in this version, also they had the kid brother and sister have parents, and the dad have a love affair. they also changed how the ship turned upside down, they used the idea of terrorist bombing the ship causing it to turn upside down(I thought that idea was dumb)"
3,"it takes to long to get to the ""roll over""",this t.v. remake comes one year before the big screen one but speed in release is all that it meant. the first hour and a half is about terrorist planting bombs aboard the ship in a post 9/11 bid to get world attention. it's bombs not waves that flip this boat. this does give time to get to know the people better but really only a few are worth the time. the last hour and a half starts the adventure and is solid if cheaply made action.not for all taste but if you can stick with it(a big if) you can have some adventure here.
1,Do Not Waste Your Time or Money Get the Original!,"The premise of the original Posiedon Adventure was a ship on its final voyage is overtuned by a tidal wave. The passengers must escape up to the hull to survive. On every level there are obstacles to overcome and not all will survive them.The premise of this TV movie is a terrorist plot to sink the high profile ship on New Year's Eve. But the valiant Homeland Security agent is able top uncover the plot and disarm them on one side of the ship but not the other creating the capsizing of the ship. And the rest is the same.But while the first is pure action film, this is pure boredom. I was excited when I hear of this remake but was disappointed in the result. Even the special effects are worse.Let's see the Summer 2006 big screen remake."
2,I'll give it TWO STARS for the BEDROOM SCENE,"This tepid remake of the Irwin Allen original features only one thing worth mentioning: the topsy-turvy rollover scene between Steve Guttenberg's character and his shipboard mistress as the two are in the midst of a ""secret rendezvous."" The sight of the tumbling pair, along with the cabin's furniture and other appointments, is good for a snicker or two.The computer imagery of the overturning ship, as well as the other ""special effects,"" is about as wooden as a deck chair from the Titanic."
3,NOT BAD!,NOT NEAR AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL. SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE OK. TOO BAD PETER WELLER DIDN'T HAVE A LONGER ROLE.
2,Disappointed,"There are already two versions of this story out there, both of which performed better than this version. The terrorist element seemed a bit too cliche and the remainder of the movie was a bit cheesy and bland. It is not totally unwatchable but on the whole why waste your time with this one. Pick up the original or the big screen remake."
2,"It does not sink, but it's not great either.","This made for TV remake of the classic thriller, is okay. Sometimes you wonder what the folks who made the film were thinking, like, the whole terrorist theme, and why did they make the priest a bishop, (who hardly challenges authority)?They did keep some things, like the Christmas Tree bit, and the dude falling and smashing into the stained glass ceiling...but then again, they did not keep enough of the classic film, likethe real reason the ship capsized...They added some really stupid stuff, like the plot with the husband cheating on his wife, and then the woman whom he cheated with, dies. Why even bother?Here's the deal. I got this film, since I loved the classic, and will be seeing the upcoming Hollywood Remake. And I am sucker for corny films. But I think, that if you buy this film thinking this is a great remake, you may be disappointed."
4,Great remake...With the times!,"The Poseidon Adventure is an entertaining thrill ride that quickly makes you forget that it is a made-for-television production.The DVD release has a few flaws indicate that Echo Bridge lacks a certain experience and understanding of the DVD market. It is a fairly new studio so there is hope that they will turn around and get a handle on these issues in the future, but for now, releases like ""The Poseidon Adventure"" are sadly technically sub-par even though the film itself is good to watch."
3,Prety Fun,"I loved the anime-sylt art in the opening and closing, and the plots were pretty good. My personal fav is Setusna. The voice actors are good... up until Kakurine opens her big mouth! Well, not opens it really... she talks, then opens it! ^_^ They did a HORRAIBLE job fitting the voices to the mouth movement! I bet the translation from the original was totally differnt, too! people said whole lines in mouth movement and said nothing! There were long waits between the characters because they should be talking longer. The game IS fun, though. Only problem is I beat it as 2 of the 8 characters the day I bought it."
4,nice little fighting game,Not bad. Graphics are Awful and the dubing isnt very smooth. I like the magic you can use. Someone needs to invent a telecanetic game. That would be cool.
3,Very good game but falls short in some small and huge areas.,This is probably the third best PlayStation fighting game I've come across. It is a very good game and is very orginal. Each character in story mode has his own TV program type story with next episodes and everything. If the character is evil you get an evil tv show. If the chracter is good you get a good tv show. The other best part of this game is its anime style. You power up to do attacks and even have techniques similar to anime. There is at least one representaive of each anime genere in this game. But the sorcerer kid saying Burst Rondo (Slayers spell) scared me a lot.And now the bad parts of this game. The dubbing is some of the worst in the world. At points I thought my CD was skipping but it was just the dubbing. It was off by 6 or 7 seconds in some spots..............
4,Animania,"This game is surprisingly addictive -- the combination of characters with their manifold tag lines (Danziver's mantra, ""I'm not easy"" cracks me up whenever I hear it) make this fairly simple game a lot of fun. Setsuna is my favorite character, although I have lately taken to Kakurine, too. It's challenging enough to remain entertaining, and is a really good game to play against another human (since the computer gets a little easy after awhile). Very colorful, great attacks, goofy anime soundtrack and voices -- deliciously incoherent."
5,excellent discussion of race--and simple color--in film,"An often fascinating read in extremely intellgible English, Dyer shows how the idea of whiteness underpins more of Western visual culture than one might have thought. Ranging from fascinating discussions of how the actual chemical composition of film stock was engineered to maximize the representation of caucasian skin on celluloid to race in cheesy Italian sword-and-sandals films of the 1950s, this is a real triumph for academic writing--a work that's actually compelling for a non-specialist, but an important intervention in the field at the same time. The last chapter or two were a little less energetic than the predecessors, I thought, but overall, one of the best I've read of this kind."
4,The Essence of Humanity,"This moving collection powerfully captures the range of emotions felt at the start of a new relationship, deep into a passionate romance, and at the end of a long engagement. All have felt the high and lows of love, but few can express those thoughts into such beautifully written poetry as Jeffrey Gray. Likened to writers such as C. K. Williams and Eugenio Montale, Gray invites his reader to take a look into his world and delve into the colorful palette of human emotions. Bound in navy blue hardcover, his anthology is an excellent addition to any library."
5,Rounder Bluegrass Greats,"This CD is a a gem. A collection of some fantastic bluegrass, both standards and newer stuff. Highly recommended!"
2,another rehashing of old bg,this album was okay. nothing great. Another rehashing of old bluegrass. THere wasn't anything on here that was any different than the other compilations.
2,Blade,"Who hand picked these? This is CD is Okay, but I think that there is much better out there. I would buy something from the big three Monroe, Flatt & Scruggs, or The Stanley Brothers. There are a couple of good songs here, but most are mediorce or even bad."
4,"A rough mix, but c'mon, it's the Beatminerz!","Listen, I don't wanna hear about how the production on 'Alter the Chemistry' is murky, poorly mixed and all that. A remix album that is basically a de facto Black Moon record? Gimme more of that.One thing I don't really like is that they retitled all of the songs, but oh well. Not a problem, especially with beats like 'He's Back,' the soul-infused 'The Ghetto,' and the deeeep bass hit of 'Chicks Out the Pen.""If you don't like it, send me your copy. I'm gonna wear mine out pretty soon."
3,no chemistry,"Dissapointment. Da Beatminerz are one of my biggest inspirations production wise and Blackmoon was one of my favorite groups to emerge from the early/mid 90s'... but unfortunately this product fell flat.I throughly enjoyed Buck & 9th's LP and when I heard Evil Dee and Mr. Walt were going to remix it, I was first in line. But... the ish doesn't bang like it should. I know Da Beatminerz make dope beats, but like what people have said reguarding both Beatminerz efforts, they fall flat.Don't get me wrong, there are some tracks that bang on this effort, but if this was a TRUE BLACK MOON LP... people would say it was a brick. The problem with remixes, is that they almost never eclipse the original track and that's what the problem is here. There are a few exceptions, but with this LP, the orignal versions of almost all the songs are better.I really want to dig this disc, but it honestly could have been WAY better."
4,The most BEAUTIFUL Rock ballads ever...,"'Bone China' and ""Stargazer' are astounding. Rock ballads without the pompus and silly pretenses of the 'Power Ballad' that was so prevelant at the time this album came out. Arguably the high points of a very strong album... R.I.P. Andrew..."
2,beverly's snowpeople sheets,"i canot give you a complete review at this time as i just used the sheets one night and they are in the laundry. they were very comfortable. my concern is when i wash them that the colors do not ""run"". what i need to do is check that out in the sink, then i can complete my review. my only other concern is that the price for these sheets was so reasonable that the shipping charge was more than the sheets. $7.48 i think. sincerely, beverly movalli"
3,"Good to start, didn't hold up","These were really soft and smooth when I first put them on my sons beds. After a week or two, they piled really badly. They still like them and they're ok for kids but I wouldn't put them on a guest bed or my own!"
3,Good for the price,"I bought these sheets for my kids, I figured you can always use extra sheet sets, even if they have winter print. They are pretty soft and my kids really like them, the only problem I have is that even after several washings they smell really strongly of the dye that was used on them. It's a little nauseating. If you can get passed that then it's a good deal, I wouldn't pay any more than $10 for this set though, the quality isn't the greatest."
4,Great for the Price!,"Yes, they're thinner than higher end flannel sheets, but my son loves them and they washed up nice. Very soft and the color hasn't faded. I don't think you can beat getting a twin sheet set for $4.99!"
5,Fantastic deal!!!,"I ordered two sets of these sheets, and they are awesome. They are so soft and cozy. My kids actually wanted to go to bed the first night they were on the bed. They also fit very well. These are an incredible buy. I'm ordering more."
2,"Good start, weak finish","I mainly read fantasy with occasional forays into scifi. I ordered this book on the strength of the acclaim from other readers. For the first several chapters I really enjoyed the read, with the biting satire and ultra hip characters. But the book lost steam mid way through, and was a bit of a chore to finish. Frankly the lectures on the nature of religion and verbal viruses were incredibly dull. It ruined the momentum created by the fast paced beginning. Also the humor virtually (pun intended) disappeared at the same time. I kept anticipating another amusing vignette but it never happened. As in many science fiction or fantasy hack jobs, the characters never rose above their stereotypic introductions. My advice is to check it out in your local library. When you get to the section involving the Librarian, if you still like it, then fork over the bucks for your own copy. Me, I'm rereading Hyperion."
2,SPOILER ALERT: The ending blows,"For the most part this was a decent book. Stephenson is a better writer, in my opinion, than William Gibson based on what I've read in Neuromancer. He makes a fairly interesting plot that weaves Sumerian mythology with computer hacking, and I liked his vision of an ultra-libertarian society. But if his handling of male/female interactions is any indication, Stephenson must be one socially inept dweeb (Again, he's still better than Gibson in this regard).Honestly, his treatment of the story's main female character sounded like nerdy masturbation material at times (I mean, who has an orgasm THAT quickly?). Furthermore, the ending was so abrupt it seemed like Stephenson just gave up. He may as well have punctuated the last sentence of the book by blowing his brains out all over it."
1,Terrible kindle version,"I'd read the book before as a paperback but thought I'd get the kindle version to reread it. It was a bit of a waste of money.It looks as though it was converted from the book using bad OCR software. The text keeps naming the main character (Hiro) as ""Hire"". Whenever an interstate road is abbreviated as, for example, I-405 this appears in the kindle text as 1-405. These are just the most frequent mistakes, there are many, many more. While it doesn't make the text unreadable it does lead to several double takes which really breaks the flow of reading the novel.All it would have taken would be for someone to proof read the text for five minutes and they would have spotted at least one of these errors."
3,The first 100 pages are great. So are the last 50.,"A friend recommended this book to me as the ""best science fiction he had ever read."" I simply do not agree.You've read the synopsis: The book is set in the near future, say 2030 a.d. or so.The author has a delightful sense of humor and witty prose. The characters are well-developed and like-able. His view of the future is sufficiently dark and yet somewhat plausible. However, his endlessly smug tone and his self-indulgent sense of humor slow the storyline of the book to a veritable crawl.This book has tones of Umberto Eco's _Foucault's Pendulum_, Gibson's _Neuromancer_, and even some Elmore Leonard in it. The effect would be spectacular if Stephenson was a strong enough author to pull it off. Sadly, he isn't. I will keep my eye on his later books and perhaps future titles... but probably borrow them next time rather than buy."
2,Harmless - should be in the junior literature section,"Obviously this book has some sort of market appeal - I guess if you put enough 'cool' things like pizza, swords, hot chicks, skaters, etc into a book it makes it cool... It's like, the book is seriously bereft of ideas and style - but it does have pizza in it. Give it to your teenage brother/son - he'll probably love it."
3,Lost interest during the reading,"I read snow crash's beginning fast.But as I came to the future lineout with people living in a future internet-universe, with chaos, that were reflected in the real-world outside, I was slowing down the reading.It might very well be one outline of the future. But I serious don't believe in it. The Nerds in the book, were not evn real nerds, and people and the world seemed lost without direction. A guy riding around with a hydrogen bomb ?That is where I stopped."
4,"Odd, fun, and compelling","This is one of the odder books I've ever read- it starts sounding very much like a goofball Douglas Adams take on the Cyberpunk genre, and morphs slowly into a philosophical thriller. That's good- the large amounts of history and philosophy might be too dry without it. Nevertheless, it's a fun romp, and worth the price of the paperback."
1,overpriced,"I have read a lot of books by many authors but with the invention of the Kindle, I will no longer pay full price, ever again. I know authors have to make a profit but compared to the money I have spent on buying books on Kindle why would I buy a Hardback book at even half the price. The authors are making a fortune on Kindle books. I know, I see my credit card every month. But that ends now, not just with this author but some of those other blown up heads that charge even more!!! I am not stupid. I would rather go to the library. The authors and their publishers need to catch up with the times cause here is one customer that won't pay more for a kindle book than a hardback."
4,Really Good,"This is not your normal sci-fi book. It is really good and diffrent, because it has sveral cool aspects, like a cyber universe,ect. i think that you should buy this book. But dont take my word for it, read the other reviews. :-) (But say mine was good) hehe"
1,Glad I did not buy it,"This book has been on my ""read list"" for months. I just happened across it the other day in the library. For the past two hours I have been trying to read it, to get past the intro chapters that most books have that set the story up, I finally made it to page 31 before just giving up. I really really wanted to get into this but I just couldnt. The writer seems to be writing just to type something up. The descriptions are flowering and wordy. You do not get caught up in or enjoy the extravagant techy jargon that just comes across as made up. For me it was as entertaining and reading a technical manual."
1,"Oh, for Christ's Sake.","""Liked Neuromancer? You'll love Snowcrash!"" I should have known better. The guy who uttered that recommendation was an idiot. Snowcrash features everything I despise about bad science fiction. First off, there's the high ""geek"" factor of technolust, where the author can't help gloating about his knowledge of computers. Second, I . . . I just can't go on. If you're looking for more Neuromancer, don't read this book. Read Cormac McCarthy or Tim O'brien instead; like Gibson, they are great writers first, genre writers second. Stephenson is a slightly clever SF hack, and that's about it."
3,An engaging comic book; gets most of the technology wrong,"Inspired at best by a DC Comics view of an alternate universe... Funny only by virtue of the audaciousness of the caricatures. Not in the same league (or genre) as ""Neuromancer,"" and not even in the same universe as ""A Canticle for Leibowitz"" as suggested by an earlier reviewer. Purely for light diversion, at which it succeeds marginally."
3,a disappointment,"Snow Crash. Well, crash is the right word. I had heard a LOT of great things about this novel, and Stephenson is certainly creative, but we never get inside the minds and feelings of these characters. The technological aspects of the novel (and the neat twist on the computer virus idea) are superb, and there is some excellent descriptive work. But it just doesnt have the strength of characters who really move the story, and involve you in it. A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT FOR ME."
3,Cyberpunk? I guess so,"There are 30 reviews that summarize the plot of Snow Crash. So I'm going to skip that.The book was okay. Just okay. I found the pacing a little uneven, and it certainly feels like an author's first full novel. The ideas encapsulated in the fiction are interesting, sometimes even compelling. But Snow Crash is a bit of an idea novel. There is only one really interesting character and Y.T. isn't really the main protagonist.The important ideas are the anarcho-capitalism and languages as virus themes. In many ways, these serve as characters as much as anything else.Finally, the novel, in my mind, closes with several poorly closed threads that are not carried on in future novels. These detract from my pleasure in the novel. If you like Stephenson's other books, you probably like Snow Crash. If you come to Snow Crash as an introduction to Stephenson, it will tell you if you will like his other books."
4,Excellent pulp cyberpunk...,"This is a great novel, reminding me of a top-quality Japanese Anime. The main character is a down-on-his-luck in the real world hacker (whose job is as an ultra-deluxe pizza delivery guy in a post-apocalyptic California) who is the premier cyber programmer in an alternate virtual world. A heck of an adventure and a heck of a good read -- just don't expect something too deep."
5,Accurate rendition of the World to come...,"Snow Crash is one of the most accurate futuristic novels written! It is a fast-paced enthralling story, which interweaves the magic of language, pizza delivery, neighborhood cities, and internet cities: where the programmers custom build their own cyber-houses... and sword fighting is a cyber-art of 1's and 0's, and toggle back to the real world, where the music scene and politics intermesh in a whirlwind plot.Delve into a interesting and enticing story of the future of media!A must read for anyone who: watches tv. reads anything. uses any computer, anytime. speaks, at all. Learn the history of our language and the future of mass media in this great story!Allison Tripp-Russo"
3,1st half good then downhill,"Has some good points but the plot goes downhill in the second part and is unsatisfying, monotonous and tedious about language"
4,pacey and ingenious,"Snow crash is certainly not short on ideas, the franchised earth is a great thought, especially when the franchises include the mafia and the US govt, and no law.The visions of the near future are indeed pretty horrific, and theres some pretty hardcore weaponry and technology, Hiros unstable nucleur chain gun has too take some beating.The opening is superb, and the book is well established in the first chapter, allowing for the then constant onslaught of ideas.The only real downside was the slightly overdone library references, the links to sumerian myths could have been chopped down a lot, the depth just wasnt needed and slowed down the story, ill admit to skipping huge swathes of these explanations.It certainly reminds me of the William Gibson stuff, although since its over ten years since a read them, its a little hard to say why."
2,It just wasn't exciting.,"After struggling over what to buy next, I reached for Snow Crash. Frankly, I thought the story was kind of boring. I loved the idea of relating ancient Sumerian myth to modern society but the story, that is built around it, is weak. There was no desciptive writing anywhere. I couldn't wait to finish so I could move on to another book. And the ending - its bad. The whole ""raft"" sequence was confusing and dull. However, with the wide range of reviews given, you'll just have to read it for yourself."
2,Loud!,"Though technicaly interesting, I thought the book followed the old rock and roll motto: if you can't play it good, play it loud. It was loud. I thoroughly enjoyed parts of the book. I found it too raunchy for my taste. I also find that authors who re-define facts, and draw their historical/technical advice seemingly from the detractors and critics more than a bit ANOYING. I would best sum it up by saying I forced my way through parts of the book to experience ""the definitive cyper-punk novel"", and in the end threw the book away rather than pass it on."
2,"It's clever, but not good.","As an idea Snow Crash is fun, inventive, and exceedingly clever. As a book Snow Crash is frustrating, condescending, and extremely dull.Stephenson is talented at creating interesting plots, but he proves himself to be truly awful at writing. This is a common malady in the Science Fiction genre, but that shouldn't make it okay.All characters are as one dimensional as paper dolls, action scenes are a consistently muddled mess, the story never invokes any sort of emotion towards it's protagonists except apathy, and the author strives so hard to make everything ""super cool"" that you'll feel like you're back in junior high.I'm sorry to give this book a bad rating because it really is based on a fun if completely implausible concept, but the execution of that idea is absolutely inexcusable."
2,WAY Overrated,i love sci fi. i'd tried to read this twice & just couldn't get traction. when i finished edelman's infoquake trilogy i wanted more so tried again after advice from a friend that this is more accessible than cryptonomicon. so i slogged through the pizza delivery bits. i am giving this story 1 star for vision & 1 star for the first two segments about semi autonomous guard units. the virus/sumerian subplot i found tediously executed - an author with more talent and/or patience would have told the story without needing pages and pages of direct exposition that saps the book of its remaining momentum (which had been flagging for some time).i wanted to like this book but it is so uneven with odd flashes of bitterness misplaced even in such deep satire that i will pass on the rest of this authors work. if you like anime you might find this visually rewarding as the descriptions are very vivid. but if you like a coherent plot and consistency in characters give this one a miss.
4,"Great Book, Well written..","Exciting, Interesting, Intriguing, humerus, amazing. These are all words that I have heard describing this book by everyone who has read it. Guess I will have to find out."
4,ladies and gentlemen: Neil Stephenson,"Snow Crash pretty much cracked sci-fi wide open. My only regret is not having read it 15 years ago or so - since so many of the ideas inside have become (or are becoming) cliche due to their influence on so many other creators.If one measure of speculative fiction is how many things the reader sees differently in their day-to-day life after exposure - then this book is among the best I've read.The concepts involved overshadowed the narrative itself, however, as I found the story to be choppy, inconsistent and poorly resolved.In the end, it was a bit like a video game that was a hell of a good time to play, regardless of whether or not the plot was the focus."
2,"As a rule I don't like cyberfiction,","If I don't like it it is because I don't like cyberpunk. This book had some good points though I suppose. It began well ,was funny in a way, & probably had some good moments. I hate to say this, but one of the reasons I don't like these kinds of books is because the people I've known who like them are creepy. I guess that's silly, but I haven't liked liked the cyberpunk I actually have tried. Well, I did like a Cadigan story I read in Asimov's, but otherwise bleh to this whole subgenre I doubt I'll try another."
2,"A Good Try, But...","I was offered Snow Crash by a friend to read. I was a little dismissive, due to it being 'cyber-punk', but I rallied on. After a fairly humourous opening, it went rapidly downhill from there.To give the man his dues, there are at least two cracking good ideas on every page. Unfortunately, the words stringing them together are awful. Horrible, dull, clunky sentences pervade most of the passages. I'd say the man can't write for toffee, but that would be unfair as I've not yet summoned the courage to read his other works. I'm told I would enjoy Cryptonomicon, but then again, I was told the same thing about Snow Crash.And then there is the info-dumping. How I hate info-dumps. The process of just reeling off large sections of what sounds like textbook or encyclopedia and just putting it down on the page as one character talking to another. Ugh. There's a lot of it in this book.So, The book gets 2 stars for the good ideas, but no more for everything else that makes it awful."
2,Another donation to the library,"Way too overwritten, with Melville style tangents into things about which nobody cares. Cyberpunk gone bad."
3,Doesn't live up to the hype...,"I really wanted to like this book but I think I went into it expecting to much. Although the story is really good (I read the whole book in one sitting)it comes across as being kind of juvenille. I don't mean that in a bad way it just seems like this book is aimed at a certain target market: teenage hacker wanna-be's into the Matrix and Nine Inch Nails. Snow Crash is a fun book but unless you fall into the target audience you probably will be a little let down, like I was. If it matters I am a Network Technician with experience in Unix and Linux, I have been devouring Bill Gibsons masterful works since I was a teenager. I love ""cyber-"" stuff; but Snow Crash just seems to target the high-school crowd."
4,Great Book right until the end,"I thought this was an incredible book, but I find that the resolution in both this book and the Cryptonomicon is too short to be satisfying. Rather than continuing the teriffic flow of the story, the tempo suddenly changes as everything works itself out. However, I found the book very entertaining and would encourage a friend to read it."
2,Drek,"A book I had to struggle to finish. I gave it a 3 because parts of it were funny, but the book, as a whole, is overrated. Cyberpunk is getting really boring -- it seems like a bunch of people who use the net got together to churn out a bunch of books with the same scenario."
4,Domino's Schmomino's - Cosa Nostra Pizza's the Best!,"In this novel (about the fifth or sixth cyberpunk novel I've read), I was really taken with the way Stephenson made the corporate states so pervasive. Of course, powerful corporations are at the heart of most cyberpunk novels, but here they completely take the place of nations (well, almost). I also enjoyed the humor apparent in the novel - I mean, really, the main good guy is named Hiro Protagonist! And the image of the Mafia Pizza guy in my mind is just too funny. You want pepperoni with that? Forget about it!"
4,Good Stephenson novel,"My first book by Neal Stephenson was Cryptonomicron (outstanding) so I had high expecatations for this, even though it was written earlier. I have to say I was about 90% satisfied. It is a great techno type novel and I really enjoyed it. Once I got about 1/2 into it, I really didn't want to put it down. My reasoning for 4 stars instead of 5 was that I don't think it was as good overall as Cryto, just didn't seem as refined and tight as that novel was. However, again if you liked Crypto you won't be disappointed, but if you thought that novel was only so-so, you might have a hard time with this one."
3,"Comic book SF, strengths and flaws","Yes, the plot falls apart. And the characters aren't multi-dimensional. But I laughed out loud at many points, something I don't often do when reading anything, particularly SF. The memo from the Feds about the proper paper to use in the bathroom (not hyperinflated currency), plus the memo about the proper way to read the memo, was a howler.It'll be interesting to see if this makes a fun movie, or ends up being as bad as Johnny Mnemonic--just don't let the director take it too seriously!"
5,I was quite impressed,"I tend to be a rather picky reader, and I can't stand poorly-written science fiction. There are a few gems out there. I love the subtlety (I didn't notice the play on words in the main character's name 'til nearly the end), the sense of humor, and the fact that the constructed world view didn't seem constructed; the book had a very down-to-earth, 'that's the way it is, period' outlook. The only problem I had with this book, and it wasn't enough to drop from 5 stars, was...what happened to Da5id?? Even a hokey 'happily-ever-after' would've sufficed in that respect. Ah well, over all an excellent book. I've just started Diamond Age..."
5,"Sci-Fi fun, action and thought in one!","This one goes into my sci-fi top ten! It's funny, and filled with action and thought to make it a must-read! Get it quick!"
2,Techno-babble mixed with religio-babble,"Our ""Hiro"" (sic) is an underachieving superman able to do anything and everything but with no desire to do anything. The author tries to tie in Sumerian superstition with the bible, and relates everything as a computer virus. The characters develop relationships amongst each other not because they should but because he needs it to further the plot. The primary characters are two-dimensional and the rest are one-dimensional. The technology side is a reasonable projection into the future from where we are. The rest is junk."
3,"Visionary cyberthriller, but plot doesn't stand up","A visionary work which popularized the term ""Avatar"" and foresaw Google Earth. Also quite humorous (Mafia pizza franchises, the main character's name, etc). However, the Sumerian background mythos is so contrived that it requires endless expository dialogue. Huge swaths of the book therefore read like an essay. Worth finishing, but not starting: the characters and action were interesting enough to push me on to the end, but overall I recommend spending the time on another book entirely (try Daniel Suarez's The Daemon for a more modern and coherent work in the same genre)."
2,"Starts great, then fizzles","This book starts off great, but about 70% of the way through it just went flat for me. There was way, way too much tedious description of all kinds of tangential stuff, a lot of it really boring, as if the author were describing the movie he was envisioning the book would become someday. The characters never really develop that much, and the story just starts to drag. That's just my opinion. I know millions would disagree. As Y.T. would say, Whatever."
3,Good enough,"The idea that drives the story is really interesting but he wastes to much energy trying to convince the reader that the sumerian ""wizards"" and hackers are pretty much the same thing, and I concur with the reviewer that said that a sort of essay on the sumerians and they language would be more useful and reader friendly that the stories and explanations that populate the book"
4,I liked it,"I liked this book - hadn't actually read it, and after I read reamde this winter I thought I better."
4,"An incredible, comic, yet entertaining read","That's why they call it fiction. The characters are crazy and a bit scary too. He has taken some of our most serious social problems; drugs, organized crime, the internet, hackers, corporate greed; and extrapolated them into an extremley entertaining, although unbelievable tale. No, this is not going to happen to America. Read the book though, I think you will enjoy it. If you like Stephenson, you must also check out ""Transfer: the end of the begining,"" by author Jerry Furland. Then you will know where America is really headed."
4,"Good Book, Good Seller, All-around good!","The book arrived in better condition than what was listed, and arrived quick- what more could you ask for?"
5,A Great Intro to Neal Stephenson,"Snow Crash was the first NS book I read - but certainly not the last. He's simply the most intriguing, creative writer I've come across and one of my first recommendations for anyone who wants to read intelligent commentary on the human condition through fiction. My only critique of Neal's work is that he doesn't always seem to know how to end a book. But maybe that's because he's such a fine writer, I just don't want it to end. Start with Snow Crash, read The Diamond Age, then if you're hooked, take a shot at reading Cryptonomicon and the Baroque Cycle."
3,"Worth Reading, But Typical Stephenson","The beginning is very funny and engrossing and draws you in. Stephenson really has an eye for detail, and he has an obsessive-techy-guy style. He also works in some really interesting ideas, such as his theories on computing and linguistics. However, this is the kind of book where Stephenson draws you in, but then can't finish the story. The book is 600+ pages, and they don't all add to the story. Stephenson is a very good writer, but he gets to involved in detail, and needs to be a more succicient writer. Unfortunately, if you've read Cryptonomicon, you'll know that this Stephenson still isn't over this habit."
3,Virtual Reality,"This book was definitely for the science fiction lover. It takes place in the future where everything is computerized. The main character, Hiro Protagonist, is a hacker, a pizza deliverer, and swordsman. He creates an alterntive world called the Metaverse. Anyone can go to the Metaverse through any computer. A ""drug"" is being distributed through Metaverse called snow crash. this drug crashes your computer and your brain. Hiro joins up with a couple of his friends and trys to stop the spread of this ""virus"". This book wasn't really my style, because I really don't like science fiction. But, it did keep me interested. I expected more action and explanation in the ending. Overall, I thought it was a decent book and I would recommend it to anyone, science fiction lover or not."
4,wonderful and thrilling,"""Snow Crash"" by Neal Stepheson, was very well written and thought out book. I love how he took the world and place it into the future, but a lot of the time you think it is happening in the present time. The book was very easy to follow and he's always keeping you on your toes at all times with alot of suspension. Extremely action packed and thrilling. I would recommend this book to anyone."
3,"Great beginning, good middle, weak ending","Stephenson has an interesting vision of the future - one in which nations have been replaced by corporate-nation-states. His depiction of the United States (Fedland) is hilarious. His use of Sumerian mythology and the idea of a metavirus is intriguing.However, much like Diamond Age, the book lacks an ending. The world is saved in about 30 pages. It's unsatisfying.Still, the beginning of the book is excellent and the middle is quite good. Stephenson is a witty satirist and he develops compelling visions of the future.Recommended, with the reservations about the ending."
4,A misinterpreted wonder,"Snow Crash's success is startlingly because it was intended to be a satire of American media. For this reason, its success as a legitimate entry into the scifi/cyberpunk world is amusing to Stephenson and those of us who noticed."
5,Snow Crash : Virus or Myth?,"I have read Snow Crash twice. It is an amazing book. Neal Stephenson did an amazing job presenting the facts dealing with 'me', 'nam-shub', and 'en'. Outside of reading Snow Crash, I have done extensive research concerning Sumerian Mythology and theology and have found these facts to be more than true.Snow Crash is an excellent book, and I highly suggest that any cyber-hippie read it."
1,Like trying to get nutrition from chewed up bubble gum,"This book is a complete waste of time. It is the worst book I have EVER read. I just kept reading it because someone recommended it to me and I was desperately hoping something interesting would happen, giving my friend the benefit of the doubt. In the end, nothing did happen. So the Raven guy tries to nuke America in cyberspace. So he fails. 500 pages of irrelevant mini tangents preceding the obvious denouement. The Sumerian legend junk and Hiro's paralleling of it to a computer/brain virus is completely far-fetched and boring (I had to skip entire paragraphs about the Ashkeran junk, it was so stupid). Then the book is peppered with spelling errors, grammatical mistakes, poor choice of words, and obvious mathematical fallacies (2^2 = 8? ). Trying to get something out of this book is like trying to get nutrients from a chewed up piece of bubble gum."
2,Two words: Over Rated,"Comic book cyberpunk. I didn't care about the characters and thought some of the good 'uns were soul-less. Also, there is a strong anti-American, anti-capitalist vibe to this book. There is a character in the story who is ""Bill Gates-level wealthy"" yet who has given the world nothing useful. Well, 'the rich' DO provide useful goods and services, thus they have wealth. One positive note: very well done Sumerian mythology blend with plotline."
1,"Save a tree, don't waste your time with this one!","Childish, sophomoric, vulgar, juvenile. Get the picture? A complete waste of paper. My guess is that this book probably appeals to immature teenage boys with raging hormones (nothing wrong with that, per se, it's just that the book feels as if it was written by someone stuck in puberty) and those with limited imaginations - it certainly is not what one might call ""literature."" At best, it may be possible to that state the author has an ""imagination,"" however, that doesn't make this book a creative experience. The story weaves and spins through endless threads that come from nowhere and then disappear, completely, into the ether. Got too much time on your hands and want something to scramble you brain on? Then this book is for you. Otherwise, look elsewhere for substance - this book doesn't have any."
1,Painfully dated,"The technology in exceptional science fiction has a sort of timeless quality to it. Dune, Armor, and Enders Game are all common examples of books that I think do a wonderful job with technology. The things described are either thoroughly alien and a delight to imagine, or have already come to be in some form but the foresight exhibited by the author is still impressive. This book, written in 1992, dares to explore the amazing technological breakthroughs of 1996. Attempting to read it in 2007 was a painful experience. Any immersion I had in the story was destroyed when the protagonist started speaking about computers and I was reminded of my copy of ""DOS for dummies"" I had in middle school (years ago)."
1,What's the point?,"I downloaded a free sample of this story because I thought the plot sounded interesting. Unfortunately the first two free chapters were explanation, description and backstory ending with a futuristic pizza delivery guy crashing into an empty swimming pool.With numerous f-bombs, lack of action, and wondering when the author was going to get to the real conflict and story line, I have no interest in paying to read the rest of the story."
5,Honestly my favorite book ever.,"If you are looking for a fun and stylish cyberpunk book, this is for you. I love it and have read it multiple times. You owe it to yourself to read the first chapter at least!"
4,fantastic novel,"This novel lived up to all the hype surrounding it and then some. I read it in very quickly. It was very hard to put it down, yet it was interesting as well. I really liked all the main characters and a lot of the technologies used in the novel. Stephenson obviously put a lot of time into researching for this novel, and gives it a nice twist to make it seem very plausible. (for a sci-fi novel) I really can't wait to read his other novels."
2,A very dificult read,"If you are a serious ""techie"" then this may be an interesting read for you. There is so much inter-acting between the cyber world and the real world that most of the time you don't know if you are in the real world or the cyber world. I have plodded through over 25% of the book and it feel as though every page is introducing new characters with character descriptions that go on forever with no advancement of the plot. There has been a hint as to what Snow Crash is but so far as not been introduced into the plot of the story. I will attempt to continue reading this book and if the plot becomes easier to read. I will give up reading this novel."
3,"Enjoyable, But Skip the Sumerian","Nowhere near as significant as a groundbreaking book like Neuromancer, this book is a light and enjoyable read. That is, if you can overlook the gaping plot holes, overly smug tone, and (worst of all) about 50 pages of garbled ancient Sumerian crap, which was about 49 pages too many."
3,"Good beginning, weak middle, okay ending","This is a good summer time read. The lead characters are interesting, although the sinister ""Raven"" is not well defined. The middle of the book expands ad nauseum on an idea that should have taken far fewer pages. The ending of the book looks like it is begging for a sequel. All in all, this is an interesting book, and would be a very interesting book if 100 pages were trimmed out of it."
5,A book that simply blows your mind...,"This book is simply excellent. Although many people have said that the characters are shallow I would say that they have depth and, well, character. I have read this book five or six times and still I cannot tire of it. My only advice is - read this book. Borrow it, buy it or steal it - whatever you do, read it."
2,"A diversion, nothing more","I read Snow Crash because someone recommended it as an alternative to Neuromancer, one of my favourite books. Snow Crash doesn't come close to Neuromancer, it's not complex enough, it doesn't have the same feel of seamlessnes.Snow Crash depicts a future of city-states spread across the former USA, where you join a country like you join a club. The technology is far advanced, but it seems to be for the benefit of the reader instead of using it as a tool to make the setting believable(imagined author quote: Hmm, people think railguns are cool, i'd better throw in one, an i'll make it fission powered and automatic- that'll make people like my book!).The same thing goes for most of everyhing when I come to think of it. It's a bit like eating large amounts of snacks; it's not that good, you won't feel good afterwards, but you don't stop eating anyway.Nonetheless, I did finish it, so if you like SF, and you have to much time on your hands, i recommend it."
2,A Struggle,"I wanted to like this book, but I should have put it down after the first page. Instead, I struggled for weeks, forcing it down like the chicken nugget my kid didn't finish but I don't want to throw away.I dig comics and the cyberpunk aesthetic, but this one came across trite and thrown together -- like a cyberpunk wannabe wrote it. The sumerian tangent was disgracefully convoluted and as unintelligible as the 'babel' it draws from -- unless I'm a dumb ass and just didn't get it.Anyway, I give 2 stars because I feel like any author taking the time and energy and displaying the courage to carve out a place in the publishing world warrants such a rating, but this book is the least enjoyable that I've read in a very long time. I did finish it, but instead of taking it to our local paperback shop, I tossed it in my recycling bin."
2,"Some nice ideas, but it doesn't work","I was really looking forward to reading this book, but frankly I am glad to have finally finished it. There were some terrific ideas in here: the virtual-reality Metaverse where wealth and status impacts on your appearance; religion as a virus infecting people through a base, ancient and long forgotten language; brains as machines that can be affected by binary code. And the book was at it's best when the hero, called Hiro Protagonist, was having these ideas explained to him by a computer program librarian within the Metaverse. But the story just doesn't hang together and as a dystopian vision of the future is not a patch on the greats such as 1984, Brave New World or A Clockwork Orange."
5,Just Awesome!,This is everything that Neuromancer (by Bill Gibson) should have been. This book is wonderful!
4,Here comes the Metaverse!,"SNOW CRASH is set in the (not too distant) future, in a world where accessing the Internet has evolved from web pages like you are presently looking at to a 3D virtual world known as the Metaverse. Hiro Protagonist, the main character, is on of the most highly skilled Metaverse hackers. I thoroughly enjoyed the first 2/3 of the book, as it dealt with a lot of the use of the Metaverse, but it seemed as though Stephenson got away from that in the last couple of chapters, and the ending was a little flat for me.Want to get involved in something that is possibly a precursor to a real Metaverse? Visit www.secondlife.com."
3,Always give the guy a second chance,"This was my first Neal Stephenson novel and I cannot say I was impressed. I am of the belief that one sould give an author a second chance though. This novel kept the pages turning for me but left me feeling kind of empty when I finished. I wish I could say more positive things about this respected author, but this book just wasn't all I thought it could have been"
4,You might like this book if...,"Do you like Sci-Fi books? Do you like computers? Are you a fan of Star Trek, Star Wars, Babylon 5, X-Files etc...? Is your favorite TV station the Sci-Fi Channel? Do you prefer e-mail over face-to-face conversation? Do you often use acronyms when speaking to others? Do you spend hours in on-line chat rooms and/or playing video games? Have you ever played Dungeons and Dragons?If you answered yes to these questions, you've probably already read this book. If you haven't, by all means read it - this book is for you.While low on serious plot, this book is none the less very entertaining."
3,Adventurous,"Hiro and Y.T. stop an attempt to take over the world and destroy all the hackers. I found Stephenson's ""Snow crash"" quite interesting and compelling, but somewhat haphazard. The parts about linguistics and some of the other asides are fascinating and insightful, but don't always seem to be woven into the story in the best fashion. Still, it's a great read overall."
5,The CyberPunk has landed!,"This was the greatest! Thrilling, action-packed, and at times pyschotic. That's cool though, I am not saying anything bad. I really liked his use of the skateboarder (I know, Kourier..) Y.T. She was so rock-on! I'm not the skater myself, but I am totally CyberPunk. It's cool for the nontechno peeps, and it is currently my most recomended book to my friends. Thanks dude! (I am not liable for any weirdness I may have expressed. I am a teenager. I do weird stuff.)"
3,A little too derivative,"Y.T. is too close to Chevette Wilson of Gibson's ""Virtual Light"" for comfort - young women who use high-tech bicycles/skateboards as inner city messengers. I hope the type doesn't become generic.""Snow Crash"" is a good cyberpunk read otherwise."
3,Interesting World and Characters,"I found the world interesting and the characters captivating. I can definitely envision a future overrun by large corporations and having a second life in the metaverse. However, I didn't connect with the philosophy of Snow Crash or felt it believable. It felt like the writer was viewing various religions through a telescope and then trying to piece them together while insinuating that they are all cult-like. I would have enjoyed the book more had it focused on more technological reasons than spiritual for the existence of Snow Crash.Snow Crash came highly recommended and being a software engineer myself it seemed like it should have been the perfect book for me. It was worth reading for the world and characters but I won't be rereading it."
4,good book,"No, great book. Enough said. Remember, this was written before the internet was in every home and school. It's a bit ahead of it's time."
2,Not for the mature reader,"Superficial development and banal, stereotypical portrayal of all major characters. If the book didn't have a somewhat interesting plotline, it would have nothing to recommend it to the mature reader (i.e. any reader who is not a teenage boy or a man with a teenager's mentality)."
2,I loved it ........AT FIRST,The author of this book owes me a day of my life back. This book initialy captivated me more than any other sci-fi novel I've read in recent years. I was hooked. The problem is the end of the book. Its so LAME and the climax is a BIG DUD. I'll never read another book by this author again!
1,Almost unreadable,"Like many other one-star reviewers, I heard about this being a classic in the Neuromancer sense. I tried to like it, I really did (I was hoping to have this be the first leap into discovering Stephenson's other works), but I ended up doing something quite rare for me: I put the book down halfway through it.I really tried, but I found it simply unreadable. I have to agree with other reviewers that the torturous sentences, simple plot, shallow characters, and just plain boring storyline killed it for me. I also found it funny that for futuristic cyberpunk sci fi, it wasn't very futuristic or cyberpunky... the technology feels like it was written by someone from the 1950's envisioning their future.I'm an avid sci fi/fantasy reader and can count the number of unfinished books on two hands. Snow Crash has joined that list. I wish I could get my money back, it was THAT bad. Are all his books written like this? Should I just stay away from Neil Stephenson?"
2,"Odd, and not very entertaining","I gave up after about 1/3 into it. The author writes of this strange world he created as if we already get it; what it is and how it came to be. I also didn't find as much humor as just plain strangeness. Maybe most of that occurs beyond the point I was willing to go to enjoy the book. Maybe if I cared about any of the characters I would've pressed on, but I didn't. I couldn't have cared less about the entire story."
3,Basic in all ways,The book was long to a point where i found myself reading it and wondering when all the pointless plot segments would come together. They eventually did but not in a style worthy of the time and effort to sift through a lot of the books ramblings.
2,Unfulfilling.,"This exciting, imaginative tale is marred by its homogenous characters and puerile sensibility.For example: two-thirds in we're finally given a good look at Raven, the story's mysterious bad guy, who turns out to be just another foul-mouthed boor with a bad 'tude.And, as they say, it's all downhill from there: the remainder is almost unreadable, as the author turns to insipid, highly contrived monologue/action sequences to come up with an ending - ANY ending, I imagine. This is an extreme disappointment after the blazing, highly readable opening chapters.Oh, well - there are some interesting bits: some of the satire is funny, the technology is funky, and the premise, although poorly executed, is fascinating. Still, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
4,Stephenson must learn to write an ending,"Pros: Pretty darn creative. Stephenson is extremely humourous. The whole section on the governmental memo on toilet paper pools was great. A steady diet of Stephenson would be too much, but once in awhile is just the change in pace I need (I usually do action/adventure books).Cons: Of the three books of his I've done, only Anathem has a reasonably written ending. Both Diamond Age and Snow Crash ended like ""And they lived happily...."" He didn't even get the ""ever after"" in. After all that effort to create a reasonably written and creative story, and he doesn't stick the landing.I find this to be a continuation of some of Stephenson's genetic theory, communication, propagation stuff that he was proposing in Diamond Age. I don't buy a word of it, but its certainly entertaining, it allows me to push my brain around in a different way.Bottom Line: A good Stephenson to start with. If you liked his other stuff, then you'll enjoy this too."
3,Inconsistent and ultimately disappointing,"Snow Crash is a modestly-compelling novel with elements of mystery, action, and historical fiction. The characters are well developed; I had no trouble placing Hiro as a multi-cultured and skilled hacker lost in mediocrity and Y.T. as just a stupid, annoying [expletive deleted]. The details into Sumerian myth and the Tower of Babel were well thought out, and while the connection with the technologically advanced Snow Crash metavirus may seem ostensibly tenuous, the author's slow-paced narrative between Hiro and the computerised Librarian is interesting enough.Unfortunately, the novel suffers from a Hollywood-esque violent action ending that ruins the story."
4,Snow Crash best in genre,"Snow crash is good science fiction. If you are looking for a deep-thought sci-fi, then you're knocking at the wrong doorstep. Neal Stephenson is an awesome writer; this is a highly entertaining book and the best in the cyber punk genre. This book is best for mature readers."
2,Has not aged well.,The book has not aged well in 20 years. Unfortunately I read it for the first time in 2012. Had I read it when it first came out I would probably feel very differently.
2,"Boring, Confusing and without a Meaningful Plot","I am on ebook page 293 of 1029 and I am completely bored by this book. In comparision Dune Book 2 is only about 387 pages and it was a lot of fun by the time I was on page 300.Sentenses are complicated. There are too many made up words that in the end don't mean much. Mix those together and you get a difficult to follow book. Other reviewers described this issue better than I did here.Main plot drags nowhere and I even cannot see main plot. I have now given up on the book and think it was a waste of money.I tried this book because I like ""The Diamond Age: Or, a Young Lady's Illustrated Primer"" by Neal Stephenson. The Diamond Age is a brilliant work and beats Snow Crash without any doubt."
1,Amazingly bad,"Thankfully I got the free sample for this book.This has the distinction of being the first sample I couldn't finish.Two pages of drivel was enough for me to delete it.It reads like a bad essay from a school boy.Maybe it gets better, since it could hardly get worse, but that was enough adolescent tripe for me to give up on this author."
1,big gaping hole,"i haven't finished, just skipped to the part about sumer and whatnot to see how that played out, and i realize that may be the dumbest idea on the planet. if he's saying humankind spoke the same language until the sumers, is he ignoring the aztecs, native americans, etc.? is he advocating some sort of christian creation story? because if he's not, then there were already different languages before the sumerians?! am i missing something?"
1,Unreadable,"The beetle ate the cockroach while reading ""100 Days of Solitude"". He preferred ""Catch-23"", which, as everyone knows, is a favorite of beetles, while cockroaches prefer ""100 Days"" - understandable if pizza is not really your thing. Of course, Jamie didn't see it that way because, well, when flying over a house, one's mind drifts - but perhaps we all drift (even when eating pizza) to somewhere over the rainbow beyond the metaphysical boundaries of common literature...WHAM! The motorcycle skidded on the poor beetle and flipped over, causing a thermonuclear explosion and a time dilation which made Star Trek into reality (yes, Kirt was interviewed by Oprah, seriously). The cockroach survived - as cockroaches do, especially in times of nuclear war (just ask archie) - but how about that pizza? Hot, dude, real hot, even without jalapenos... Need I continue?"
1,BORING self-indulgent drivel,"Whatever fun and interesting sci-fi creations are present are rendered utterly worthless by the underlying religious mumbo-jumbo PLOT devices. I loved the first hour, but the PLOT--that is the middle four-fifths of the story and the driving power of the story-- was BORING self-indulgent drivel created out of whole cloth in a free-association style that killed my enjoyment of some of the clever sci-fi devices."
1,"good for atheists, offensive to Christians","I read this book initially during my younger, agnostic years, and I liked it a lot. Inventive, crazy, disturbing, and definitely entertaining. Tried to re-read it recently and found it deeply offensive, now that I am a Christian. In this book the Holy Spirit is likened to a virus. I threw it in the trash, could not finish it. So, if you are an atheist and like books that trash Christianity and reinforce your world view, then this one is for you. I don't require the promotion of my world view in the books I read, but I'd rather not have it attacked. I don't understand why so many sci-fi authors do that these days, given that the super majority of Americans self identify as Christians."
2,Did not like it.,"I can never stop reading a book half way. With the books I have had trouble getting through I usually buy the audio book. This is one of those books. It is a great concept, awesome in fact, but the story just drags on and on. I couldn't get into it. It took me about a month to get through it. Unlike the hunger games trilogy which I read all three in about a month."
2,Does not stand the test of time...,"I read and enjoyed Cryptonomicon, so I figured I'd give another of Stephenson's books a shot.This just didn't really stand up. The events in the book really felt like they were the dream of some adolescent teenager, with a random pizza-guy-hacker-swordmaster running around doing stuff. Stephenson did a bit too much telling, not showing, with how the events unfold in the book (the main character - Hiro Protagonist - spends pages describing exactly what just happened to someone, rather than making the events clear through the actual story).The books saving grace is it's very-early realization of a virtual reality world. Stephenson got a lot right, even before such a thing was really more than a pipe dream. However, now that we're starting to see similar stuff, it loses a lot of it's luster. It also was pretty quickly paced."
5,ya,This book is a highly stylized super powered brain child of 1984. Snow Crash excels in other areas where 1984 lacked merely do to its date of brith. If you like saumrias and legends and hate governments big biz this is the book for you.
5,One of the best in its genre.,This is one of those books that will make you want to read other Neil Stephenson pieces. That is what has happened to me. It contains very competent writing and very memorable images.
5,Best Book I've Read All Year!,"This goes beyond creative imagination, but takes the mind into a type of universe you would expect out of ""Heavy Metal"" magazines. There is a lot of humor and seriousness. The history behind the Sumerian part of this book rates top notch and the computer information is superb!When you can successfully mix a martial artist in the virtual world that totes pizzas for a living and make the whole thing work, it is a sign of pure madness or genius! If there is any book you must read this year, IT IS THIS BOOK! I highly recommend it for those who love history, computer technology, cyber punk, or any science fiction! This book has almost anything you can imagine and then some. Jam packed full of all the action you could possible expect, and all the warped humor and excitement that you need.This book I could not put down until I was finished with it. I haven't seen this kind of creative genius around in a long time amongst the writing community. A MUST READ!"
5,the software engineers of the future are reading this book,"Java/Network programmers are already buildingprototypes of the Street. Where do they gettheir ideas? Snow Crash, Neuromancer, True Names.Read 'em all to see the future."
5,"Funny, smart, well written","This novel may not fit exactly into any specific sub-genre of science fiction. It is a very good book though, but don't pick it up expecting it to be a copy of Gibson's or Sterling's novels. It isn't. It does borrow some of the themes of cyberpunk, but it is also filled with original ideas. If you like Gibson and Sterling then you will probably very much enjoy this novel as well.Also, this novel contains the best pizza delivery sequence ever written.Buy it, read it."
4,Neal Stephenson's cyberpunk manifesto!,"Neal Stephenson's ""Snow Crash"" is an in your face, stay up late and read cyberpunk manifesto. While reading one might notice themself scratching their head and thinking,""What the! Where the hell does this guy come up with this, huh"". The best part about it is that it all manages to work together; magnificently. This book is so filled with far out ideas that it's almost hard to keep up with, but somehow manages to gel at the macro level. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it kind of just ends with out much of an ending. Don't let this deter you, if you like Sci Fi and/or cyberpunk, you will love ""Snow Crash""."
4,No-Holds-Barred Cyberpunk,"Years ago, this book was all the rage with a group of my friends, and after hearing them talk so much about it, I had to check it out for myself. I wasn't disappointed; Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash is a superb cyberpunk novel with fun characters thrown in.Hiro Protagonist (no, really...that's his name) is a sometime pizza boy in an America that has become fractured and conglomerated by corporations. However, his real a/vocation is his life on the net, wherein he is a sword-swing agent. When his net mogul friend, Da5id, is rendered brainless by a strange computer virus called Snow Crash, Hiro is thrown into an adventure with Mesopotamian mythology, mad mafia pizza moguls, a criminal whose weapon of choice is plate-glass spears, a massive floating island of refugees, and a cynical teenage skateboard courier. Stephenson has an eye for both satire and for enthralling description. Highly recommended for any fan of William Gibson."
5,a little something for everyone,"I LOVED this book, and I usually hate reading. Snow Crash meshes cyber sci fi, mythology, and satire into one fun book. This book works on many levels. You can read it for the entertaining plot, analyze every aspect of it, or anything in between. Stephenson is a detailed writer, but he won't bore you. The only bad part about this book was its occasional explicitness."
4,Snow Crash,I chose this book because it was recommended by a coworker.Great book! Glad that I read it.I would recommend this book.
4,Very good read,"Been meaning to read this book for some time. I am glad I did, but upset it took me so long"
3,Anthropology and Science Fiction a mixed bag,"Great book that is brought to screeching halts by long lectures on Sumerian Mythology. Comparing computer programming with ancient civilizations seemed far-fetched and out of place. The pages where Hiro is lectured by the Computer on were tough to get through and ruined the flow of the story. Seemed forced and didn't add to the story at all, ruined an otherwise great book that was years ahead of it's time."
2,proceed with caution,"I really wish that I liked this book. It was obviously well reseached and entertaining in some parts. But I just completely lost interest after about 100 pages. It tried to get to serious, and for me, this ruined the book. I can see why some people would love this book, but it is not for everyone. I hate books that take themselves to seriously when they dont have to. This book should have been about 100 pages shorter by cutting out all the useless information that was in it. I liked the pace of the book but the things that were happening were boring."
3,Way too violent for me,"Too bad there is no MPAA rating for books (at least not that I know of, if someone knows a rating system for books then please let me know) like there is for movies. This book would otherwise be rated NC-17 based on the gory violence. Obviously it doesn't bother most people, but it bothers me. The language would also give the book at least an R rating. I could overlook the foul language but gave up a third into the book because of the gore. So if violence and sliced up corpses doesn't bother you then this might be a good book, otherwise be warned."
2,"No heart, all whiz bang techiness","Interesting idea... but.. and this is a huge but... there is very, very little character development... no matter what the genre... if an author doesn't give a character a personality that I can delve into and go with I am bored, bored, bored with pages of technostuff no matter how brilliant. I like a lot of genre's, a good book is a good book. Snow Crash lacks characters that are anything more than a cookie cutter stamped out image.. this is the bad guy, this is the good guy, this is the chick.... not enough for me... sorry."
5,ECW!!!,if your looking for-tables-flaming tables-barb wire-thumbtacks-garbage cans-chairs-ladders-kendosticks-high flying action-19 brutal matches-cheese gradersthen i suggest you get this dvd and watch it for hours. This is better then any normal wwe or tna dvd. I enjoyed this dvd and i hope you will to!
4,Very Confused! PLEASE HELP!!!,"it's quite funny, the dvd that i bought today does NOT say the words bloodsport above the ECW sign, & instead of saying 'the most violent matches', it says 'the most extreme matches'...i am really confused here.. the ECW sign is in black on my DVD set. the amazing thing is, is that it has the exact same matches that ppl have mentioned & the exact same extras... i don't know though if i should return it since it could be a fake, & not a original WWE release... could somebody please help me to tell me if there are also sets out there that say what i just mentioned about the front cover. & also i paid R260 for mine since i live in south africa... btw, i didnt order the DVD off amazon, i got it str8 off the shelves at a local shop... if i hav to convert it to dollars, i paid $45 for it... is that a rip off or is the price fine? pleas HELP! any advice will be appreciated! thanks"
2,get some new matches,"all these kids writting reviews about this dvd don't know a thing about ecw other then what the wwF has told them. i'm not dogging this dvd..well yeah i am. most of these awesome matches you can get on any ecw dvds (real ecw dvds!). if the wwf wants to put out a good ecw dvd, then get some new matches. if they're just gonna put out the same matches you can find on another ecw disk, then just come out with a box set of stuff that showcases almost everything ecw had to offer, cause then at least it would actually be worth the money. ecw was the greatest wrestling group ever... they also didn't lose their name to some f'n pandas"
5,OH MY GOD!..........,"Ah, ECW. Three simple letters that brought so much joy to so many people and helped so many careers. This two disc DVD that has the bloodiest brawls is a good place for people who may have never even heard of ECW to see what it was all about.Some matches were exciting and very good (Chicago Street Fight, Stretcher Match, Awesome/Tanaka 2005, Weapons Match, I Quit Match) while others were just a little boring (Four Corners,Luch Libre). Anyway it was just good to see some ECW matches again.This two disc set features the best of the ECW roster with Tommy Dreamer, Sabu, Terry Funk, The Dudleys, Mike Awesome, Balls Mahoney, Masato Tanaka, and RVD. In my oppion, disc two is the better of the two disc's. Disc one does have good matches like the Taipie Death Match, Weapons, Stretcher, and Three way matches. So, in short, buy with confidence. BTW: I'm 14ECW LIVES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,VERY TRUE ECW MATCHES....,"You don't know what the hell you are talking about man, if these aren't what true ECW DVD's then everyone in the arenas of WWE shows are all Cena fans!!!!!This is a great DVD, buy and watch Born to be Wired and tell me it's not F*ing Hardcore......"
4,i wanna get sumthin clear,"ok so everyone is saying in Tommy Dreamer's match with Brian Lee that at the end of the match he get choked slammed through up to 6 tables, well just so everyone knows that a exageration its only 3 MAYBE 4 because you hear Joey Styles say (OH MY GOD THATS 3 TABLES STACKED UP) and then you see someone get another table, but you never see them but it ontop the other ones.so yeah, just wanted to get that out of the way. Good dvd, i think they couldve replaced sum matches with sum really crazy ones. where are all those crazy tables on fire?? THERE IS ONLY ONE MATCH WITH JUST ONE TABLE ON FIRE!!! (not including extras)"
5,Some people just don't get it....,"You idiot, the WWF is now called WWE, talk about being under a rock for the past 4 years, what the f*ck are you rambling about? Since you seem to not understand what is going on, let me explain....the WWE is putting out REAL ECW matches that were unavailable to people who loved ECW but couldn't see it for 90% of the time because you idiot not everyone lived in South Philladelphia. This is a great set to see REAL ecw matches if no one managed to see them when ECW was in its prime. STOP BRINGING DOWN THE RATING FOR THIS GREAT DVD.Anyways you guys are just TNA wannabes who think TNA is the new ECW or something, HA HA HA. Buy this DVD people, you won't regret it...."
4,"As usual, Gardner rocks","No surprise. If you knew Gardner in the ""good times"" when he wrote in Scientific American you will have no surprise. Very good book for enjoyment when in a warm afternoon in a hammock."
2,too easy,"This book may be challenging for infants, but for my intelligence, i found the game boring."
4,Fun book for a teen.,I had expected clever word and math puzzles and I was a little disappointed to find the book devoted a lot of space to visual puzzles. Many of the puzzles are very amusing.
5,Good Puzzle book,This is an interesting book or a good gift for all ages (above high school level) who is intested in puzzles. It makes your mind work and keep you interested in the problems. Seems to have done a good translation for English readers.
4,Pieces of Peace,"I was originally drawn to the title because I am always in search of things that seem helpful. Reach for Peace really took me to that special place. This world is a good place to be, but let it be known that there are options."
5,a collection of poetry of the personal with universal appeal,"Louise Gluck's latest collection of poems reveal a new cadence to her voice.There is a directness of speech and lack of opacity which is new to her work.The poems as previously in her work inhabit the world of the reflective thoughtful person sighing in the noisy world .Memories and feelings for the past ,present and future beg to have sense made of them.I was struck by the description of seemingly endless days spent in her childhood on Long Island where time almost began to cease to exist.This is an excellent book don't miss it."
3,Bollingen Prize winner,"I know Gluck has won all kinds of awards and honors, but to be honest, I found this collection to be mediocre (though her poem ""Youth"" is pretty good). It isn't bad, but it isn't something that I'd recommend anyone run out and buy."
4,"Very helpful to Mid-Atlantic ""newbie""","I just moved to Maryland from a quite different climate and was unsure how to deal with the changing seasons in this part of the country. It's very helpful to be able to look under a particular month and plant type and figure out what I'm supposed to be doing this time of year. Should I still be pruning my flowers? Is it okay to plant ANYTHING this time of year? What about preparing my garden for the winter? How do I deal with humid summers? My new home has a long-untended yard and garden, so I will pretty much be starting from scratch, and it's great to have some idea what can be planted, when it can be planted, and how to care for it."
2,"Needs to be organized by month, not by plant type","I really like the information in this book. However instead of being organized by Month as the title suggests, It is organized by Plant type (perennial, annual,etc.) I find it time consuming and frustrating to have to continually flip from one section to another just to find out what to do for a specific month."
3,Needs to be reorganized,"I like the idea behind this book a lot. It has a lot of good tips, but it needs to be reorganized. There are January - December sections for annuals, perennials, bulbs, etc. I don't like having to have to go to several different sections for each month. It would be a nicer book if it was better organized."
1,Helpful guide,This book was exactly what I was looking for. Being unfamiliar with Mid-Atlantic gardening it provided the guidelines that I needed.
2,Needs a better organization,"Although the book has a lot of useful information, it's very difficult to find all the info you need for the plants that you're working with."
2,slow delivery,"I think this book is great, however the delivery was so slow from the bookseller, I had to purchase a second book. the book finally arrived, so now I have two similar gardeniing books."
2,"WORTHWHILE PREMISE, BOOK TITLES MAY NOT BE FAMILIAR","The ""If the Wolf Were an Octopus"" books are wonderful tools for involving students in answering questions from Bloom's taxonomy, including: Knowledge, Comprehension, Application, Analysis, Synthesis, and Evaluation. This particular book for Grades 5 to 6 lists questions for book titles for those (give or take) grade levels. However, the majority of my students will not have read most of these books: The Secret of Poplar Island, Taking Control, Kipton & Gruff, The Dragon Charmer, Harly Weaver and the Race Across America, For the Love of Gold, They Would Never be Friends, Make Me Disappear, Stray Cat, Ben and Me, etc. I was looking for the ""Wolf/Octopus"" book containing questions for nursery rhymes such as ""Hansel and Gretel""."
4,physical yet relaxing,"i've used this tape since 1988. the music is a little dated now, but the workout is great. it starts with stretching, then aerobics, and a relaxation period at the end - i'm buying a second copy because my old tape broke."
5,awesome staple exercise video,"I happened upon this tape about 15 years ago in some bargain bin. I have purchased a number of videos since then and I keep coming back to this one. Nothing fancy or gimmicky but if you have 60 minutes to spare it covers: warm up, arms, aerobic, stomach, legs, butt and cooldown. If you only have 20 minutes the warmup and arms is a great morning stretch. I am so psyched because my video is worn down and about to break and just found out they rereleased this on dvd!"
1,"very ""80's""","This video is pretty out of date, I did not enjoy the workout, and I can not recommend this to anyone."
5,"A ""Should Read"" Book for Reformed Believers","This book was a great help in solidifying my views of the 5 Solas of Scripture (Scripture alone, Christ alone, grace alone, faith alone, glory to God alone). These 5 views shook the world of Luther and Calvin's day and I believe with a firm, renewed grasp of them, a new Reformation can take place to re-establish them to the place of prominence they deserve to be in.Also, as a side note, I have purchased 2 copies of this book and given them away and will be purchasing another one to hopefully keep for myself to re-read again."
4,Reccomended,"I read this book for a class. Interesting. The big name movie star referenced hold your attention like a magazine does, but I like picture books. :)"
5,Satisfied with purchase!,Got this book for a class in school and it came with everything that was stated in the description. Very satisfied!!
2,Not very satisfied,"The book looked like it had some water damage. I don't know if it was already like this or if it was damage during delivery. Overall, it was in fair conditions and I was able to use it for my course. There was no pages serously damage."
5,"""INFORMATIVE!""","This textbook was purchased to fulfill a required ""humanaties"" course, while attending college. It's informative, easy to read, and guides you into becoming a ""trained observer"" in the art of watching films. As part of the curriculum I was instructed to watch several films selected by my professor. Some of the assigned films I would have never viewed by choice, including classics. However, this textbook has definitely given me a whole new perspective when attending a movie theater or at home watching a DVD. I've also acquired a deeper appreciation and understanding for all the hard work that goes into film making. Buy it for school or as a guide to help you enjoy your next movie experience."
3,Homework assignment,The tutorial CD-Rom did not come with this book. It was needed for part of my homework assignments so I was not able to complete some of them without it.
3,Required for class but vague,"I purchased this book as a requirement for a UOP course. The text was somewhat informative yet vague in many areas. However, using this textbook along with other research proved useful. I admit that given the short amount of time in which to obtain this textbook, Amazon was a great resource. I highly recommend Amazon for the purchase of this book."
4,"Its heartwarming, depressing, and makes you wanna cry","The song is somewhat depressing specially for anyone who has seen his or her relationship go in disarray. It makes you value your existing relationships, may it be towards a friend, relative, or that special someone.The line that strikes me most is ""If you'll ever leave, baby you would take away everything good/real in my life""... Wow!!!! I mean that's really cherishing a relationship. And that for itself makes as human.I've been listening to it for almost a year now, and may it be Leann Rimes', or Trisha Yearwood's version, its totally specially to me... ""makahulugan (meaningful)"", ""makatao (humanly)"", ""mula sa puso (straight from the heart).""All the best to you Leann, you're gonna be a great star, take it from me!!!!"
4,Pretty Song,"I like the song, and the original version is the best. That is track 5. If you want a remix, I think track 4 is the best one."
5,LeAnn Rocks!,"First of all, I never ever liked any sort of Country music, with the exception of this. I am mostly into dance music, and the RH Factor Radio Edit is by far the best mix, in my opinion. With a catchy synth line in the back and LeAnn's stellar vocals, it is the best song ever created. If you like dance music, country music, remixes, or just LeAnn Rimes, DEFINITELY BUY THIS! You will not be disappointed!"
1,not what i expected,this book is unlike any book that I have ordered with any company-it came in very small (yes a hardback but the size of a child's book) and the print is tiny! I will need to order with someone else just to be able to finish up the series I have started-do not recommend to anyone!
1,HORRIBLE! Shame on Beverly Lewis!,"This was the most awful and depressing book I have ever read. I don't understand how Beverly Lewis ever got it published! Who would like it? People who constantly want to feel sorry for themselves, that's who! It was supposed to be based on her childhood, you would have thought she could have made it more interesting than that. Read ""The Postcard"" and ""The Crossroad"", which are beautifully written, but don't lay a finger on this one! If you should be so unfortunate to get it as a gift, please run screaming for the hills!"
4,This was a short but OK addition to other Beverly Lewis books,I was surprised this book was so small & short; not like any of the other books I've read by Beverly Lewis. I should have waited til the price came down before purchasing.
5,This is a great book.,"This book is required for Dr. Towns' Theology 202 class, but it is still a very intriguing book. It touches on many popular subjects of theological debate."
2,"Sizes inaccurate, Lids are loose -Tupperware this is not","I waited three months for these storage containers and was so excited to receive them yesterday -- that is until I opened the boxes. I lifted the first jar out of the box and it fell onto the floor, leaving the lid still firmly grasped in my hand. Removing the second one, I held onto the entire jar, then discovered it was also not the ""tight fit"" as had been written in the description. A couple of the lids do fit securely enough that when I lift them (empty, mind you, not even containing a morsel of anything other than the ""acrylic"" from which it is made) the lids remain on the jars. Not a good ratio, since I have 12 jars and am expecting a third box eventually. Additionally, the measurments are not as described. Actual sizes are 1.6L (1), .9L (1), .5L (2) and .3L(2). I will use them for storing odds and ends."
3,"Much to admire, much to edit......","Orley Farm is characteristic of 19th century serial novels insofar as it provides the reader a great deal of enjoyment dampened by quite a bit of extraneous dross. There are numerous enjoyable plot twists, a few surprises and whole chapters that could be edited out without sacrificing a smidgeon of understanding on the part of the reader.Main characters are often little more than caricatures of virtue or vice. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it does temper any real development or evolution on most of the protagonists' part. Masons, Ormes, Furnivals, Stackleys and Duckwraths lolligag their way toward denoument, with good, not surprisingly, triumphant over evil. It's all very pleasant, but not much more than a good read.For me, Trollope's Can You Forgive Her?, with its stubborn battle of wills between protaganists and an ambiguous ending was far more satisfying."
5,Wild Kratts review,My kids would watch Wild Kratts 24/7 if I let them! This has some of their favorite episodes. I love that it is educational too.
5,Best Show EVER!,"We are very strict about the media our young children are exposed to. It is getting more difficult as they get older and through other kids are exposed to new ideas and things we wouldn't generally like introduced. This show is great. It is good clean fun, while my kids are learning about different animals in EVERY episode. It also has kind of a super hero vibe as the wild kratts put on their creature power suits to help save the animals from the villan zak who would like to use the differnt animals for various things (ex. In one of the episodes he wanted to capture the animals (anteater I think) and use to dig his swimming pool since they are such great diggers). It is good clean fun with the heros and the bad guys never any shooting of guns or lazers or bombs or anything like that. My kids LOVE this show!"
1,Video had no sound,"My kids were so excited to get this movie for Christmas. But when they tried it, it had no sound! Isn't there any quality control in here??"
3,Okay...wish they would have more!!!,My 4 year old loves Wild Kratts...now I only wish they would start making toys associated with the show. He loves to use his creature powers and it would be cool if they made Creature power buttons or a costume to dress up as or playsets with Martin and Chris.
1,Fantastic,"I love the PBS station for the shows they air. Educational and entertaining. I was thrilled to see Wild Kratts on DVD and look forward to future seasons on DVD. My girls love the show and watch this DVD over and over. I watch it with them, learning things I never knew before about land animals and marine life. The Kratt brothers are awesome!"
1,Subsitute,"I ordered a similar product, but of the original brand by Kendall. I was sent a substitute made by Medline without any notification. This product does a poor quality of work, there is no comparison with the one made by Kendall, and it should not be substituted without me agreeing with it."
1,"Pathetic, doesn't work, waste of money","Beware of this product. It always freezes up half way though the download when transfering photos to my computer. I have another USB 1.0 card reader that works perfectly. I upgrade to get the speed boost with USB 2.0, but this product is fundamentally flawed and buggy."
4,Just what I need!!!,"This card reader just do the job well done... reads, writes my sd cards in the usb port. I doesn't have the 5 star because it has a little problem with the cover over the SD card, it doesn't fit tight and you may losse it. But I push a little bit the borders of the cover to the inside and it fit fine...."
5,"It works, it's easy","After wire connection trauma with my last camera, this makes moving pictures from my new Canon to the computer an easy experience. Go for it!"
3,Difficult to remove Memory Card,"It is not easy to remove the card once you insert it into the reader. The card is very delicate and can be damaged eailky. On most phones, there is a ""push"" button which releases the card. In this reader you have to yank the card out of the reader which can damage the card."
5,great device,this card reader is great. it works well and fast. my biggest thing about this drive is that it seems to be faster even than transferring directly off my camera.
5,IOGEAR Universal Memory Drive Hi-Speed USB 2.0 Memory Card Reader,It works...that simple. I read a couple of negative reviews prior to ordering. I received the product and couldn't find anything I didn't like about it. It fits in the pocket of a shirt or pants. I visited friends over the holidays and simply took the SD card out of the camera and let them have their pictures prior to leaving their house and coming home. You can use it to store documents as well as photos. Carry an extra SD card for your camera. The SD card slides into one end and there is a cap to cover it. The USB plug is the other end. No software needed. XP recognized it on four computers so far with no problems. No big deal. It's simple and works. Don't loose the caps. There are two caps and one central (body) unit that holds the SD card (cap #1) and contains the USB plug (cap #2). Three pieces to the unit. (see pic on Amozaon's page)
3,kind of bulky,it's nice that it's so compact but keep in mind that it sticks out about a 1/2 inch on each side of the usb slot so ... if you are using it in a macbook or similar you would have to remove all other USB devices to slide it in place.
5,cute and compact,"I bought this as a present for a friend...she isn't very technology/gadget savvy, but she loved this. She said it was cute & easy to use and install."
4,Reads and writes so fast,I use it from 6 months with an 1GB microSD card and with my old 512SD. Reads and writes so fast. And cheap. Wish it have an neck strap.
1,Corrupts data,"I thought this device was great when I first got it. Then I decided to run a test and write some files and read them back. Corruption! I spent hours testing this reader versus another reader that I already had using two different memory cards. The other reader/writer I had NEVER resulted in corrupted data. This reader corrupted data! So get this reader only if you don't care about a few corrupted bits and bytes here and there. I have requested a replacement unit to try out just in case I got a defective unit and will post an update to this review with the follow-up results.UPDATE: The 2nd reader I received seems to work much better, but there was still one instance in several tests where there was some corruption. I will probably just keep this unit and verify any writes I make with it. Amazon's return service was excellent."
2,Fine product - bad vendor,"Cannot recommend buying from ANTonline. It took them 20 days to ship a product they could send in first class mail for $1.20. Second, their customer service was ignorant at best."
2,"Not the correct item, however works fine","I didn't read the fine print from the seller and was saddled with a generic reader. The generic unit, which I received, works fine, however I wasn't happy that the IOGEAR was represented on the presentation page, but the fine print stated ""generic""."
4,Better than a Jump drive but could use a key ring.,This is much better than a jump drive.. if you already have sd or mmc cards for an mp3 player or a digital camera then this product is a must. it costs a fraction of the price of a jump drive and you can change cards if you run out of space. the only thing that kept this away from 5 stars is the fact that i can't keep it on my key chain or on a lanyard. also the cover for where you put the sd card isn't as secure as i think it should be.. other than those two things this is an excellent product.
3,"Works fine, but don't wear it from your key chain","I bought this so that a spare SD card could double as a ""jump drive."" It worked fine ... until the card was corrupted (might've been the PNY card, might've been this USB holder). A newer, Sandisk card works in it 98% of the time.The card cover is very loose, and slides off on its own. IGNORE THE HOME-GROWN KEYCHAIN PICTURES. If you do this, you are sure to lose your $10 card reader and $60 memory card.____________2009 Update: I've used this regularly for the intervening years, and it still works great. In fact, it sees most of its use as a Fedora Live bootable USB drive. Works great."
1,What a disappointment!,"This product sounded like a great idea, but unfortunately, it causes sporadic errors when trying to read or write to it. At first I thought I had a bum SD flash chip, but that wasn't the case: my computer (Dell Inspiron E1505) has an SD slot, and the chip (Transcend 150x 2GB SD) works perfectly in it. I live in a place that makes it difficult and expensive to return things for warranty replacement--the shipping would have cost me more than the drive itself, so I was just stuck with an unreliable (and therefore useless) product."
5,Comparison to my own life,"I got the idea to read S.E. Hinton's ""The Outsiders"" from by best friend. We saw the movie together and she got me the book for my birthday. Now I've read it twice already!! It's my favorite book!! Reading this book made me compare it to my own life and I concluded that my life and the lives of ""The Outsiders"" are somewhat the same. Discrimination from other classes . We are the kids that get made fun of 'cause of how we talk and what we wear. But we try not let this bother us and get along with each other. It's us, ""ghetto kids"" (sometimes we get called that, and like were ""thugin'"" from the hood), and the other ones, the rich kids that shop and A&E and AF, the preppy kids, they're the ones that call us that stuff. But all in all, ""The Outsiders"" is my most favoriet book in the entire world, I love it!!"
4,A life-saver for immunology newbies,"This book has definitely helped me visualize and conceptualize processes and concepts that are so obvious to immunologists that it's impossible to look up a definition anywhere! My only beef with the book is that on so many pages, ""illustrated"" means ""a picture of a dead guy who invented some earth-shattering technique."""
1,WOW! Best movie ever since Show Girls!,"Anybody out there know what CONTEXT means? Well, OK, for the 98% of you out there still scratching your hairdos, it's what is totally absence from this hollywood O-D experience, a mechanical production from beginning to end, touring through 100 years of pop music with all the over-speeded charm of a 42nd street live porn show. This is the audio-visual equivalent of too much acid & speed taken at the same time by the wrong person. MAJOR DOO-DOO!"
5,Greater than great,it is very strange in the begining but as it goes on you relize that its very interesting its a very good musical and the casting is great every one in it is like there not them there there charicter. the first time i saw it i thought i cant watch this then i just sat there for a second and got hooked on it i could watch the ending over and over again it is a great story and great music and a great movie i think it deserves more than 5 stars
5,One of my favorite musicals,This is one of my favorite movies. I am very happy to see out on Blu-ray. I have only had time to review a few scenes and am looking forward to sitting down and watching the entire movie.
3,Oh Please!,"Golden Globes? Oscar nominations? Are we speaking of the same movie? This movie was bad. The ""love story"" was horrible. Was the director attempting a satire of the stereotypical movie romance? Was he playing it straight? It was impossible to tell. It was best when it was at its most ridiculous because it seemed to be cleaverly making fun of itself, but most of the time the movie pushed you to take it as a serious emotional love story. I give it 3 stars for originality though. I admire the nerve of any movie that trys to break the Hollywood mold, even if it is unsuccessful."
5,wild ride,"kind of like a train wreck, you can't help but watch. If you take it in small increments it is incredible, piece by piece it is really good... trying to watch the entire movie is a bit overwhelming, but all in all is one incredible movie!"
5,Breathtaking,"I'd heard the description ""breathtaking"" used countless times before but never actually experienced the sensation myself, until I saw this movie. My breath disappeared twice, so awe-inspiring is the sweep of ""Moulin Rouge"". I won't bother to try and explain (it's impossible), just buy this DVD or go see it at the cinema. Utterly, utterly perfect."
5,Moulin Rouge 2001,"This is definitely Oscar calibre. I loved Kidman's character, her story's irony and its romantic twist."
4,A dream,"Moulin Rouge is like a dream. A fresh, exuberant dream. There are fantastical landscapes, caricature supporting characters that show depth at unexpected moments, startling juxtapositions. There are recurring themes of truth, beauty, freedom and love. There is the vibrant happiness that the 2 leads find in each other. And of course the conflict that threatens to tear them apart. Add fine acting, lively anachronistic song-and-dance numbers and stunning visuals, and you've got a film that's great entertainment."
5,One of the best movies I've ever seen,"I have usually shyed away from musicals thinking them boring, but this movie changed everything. I absolutley loved it. Ewan MacGregor and Nicole Kidman are incredible together as actors and singers. The sets, costumes, make-up, music, acting, dancing, everything was incredible."
4,Dirty Dancing 2,"I had the most enjoyable time watching this one. This is the ""Dirty Dancing"" of the 21st century. Patrick Swayze watch your back cuz Ewan McGregor has got your number in the hip-shaking game. Plus he has the voice to back it up too. When I heard him sing for the first time, I forgot that I was in a theatre and not in heaven. The other star, Ms. Kidman, was spectacular in her own right. One of her better performances since ""Days of Thunder."" The movie wanted me to get up and dance in the theatre aisle, as i did when i saw ""Dirty Dancing"" I never knew i could have ""the time of my life"" again!"
2,Moulin Misses the Mark,"MOULIN ROUGE, although it has apparently, though oddly, regenerated an interest in the full-blown ""Hollywood musical"" left me totally cold. I found it a bloated, incomprehensible mish-mash of cheap cinematic tricks, with little or no substance, relying on the use of pre-existing musical numbers, erratically staged, and performances obviosuly coaxed from actors who cared little about their roles or the project. Visually tiring, with its peculiar editing, it was a total chore to sit through. Thank goodness Miramax ignored this dismal effort and took the plunge to make CHICAGO, which is infinately a much better film musical. If ""the musical"" does indeed return to Hollywood and once again becomes acceptable and accessible to the movie-going public, it will be because of CHICAGO, not the trite and over-the-top MOULIN ROUGE."
1,How was this a blockbuster?,"Time is too short to waste on this. Where was the plot? Where was the development of the chararcters? It shows you with great marketing, the public will make almost anything a success. Don't waste your time on this movie!"
5,Original and enjoyable version of Camille,"The story behind this movie is not very original as has been pointed out. This is a deliberate retelling of La Dame aux camélias or Camille by Dumas, a story which has been portrayed more often than it is possible to count. This is however the most original version based on that theme in a long while (since Verdi's La Traviata in my opinion). In fact this is one of the most visually and musically splendid films I've seen as well as one of the funniest. For instance when Zidler started speaking the lyrics from Like a Virgin the theater erupted in laughter (as on many other occasions).P.S. My experience after seeing it a few times with different people is that those who are not well acquainted with the (mostly well known) songs and lyrics beforehand are not quite able to appreciate the humour and irony of this movie. However everybody I know has been able to enjoy it as a great musical."
5,this is not a movie this is a life-changing experience,I'm still speechless when it comes to this movie. Just watch it and you'll see.
2,What Happened To The Original????,"I absolutely LOVED this movie in the theater but this VHS edition is not nearly as good. The big screen version had me thinking that this would be my new favorite musical to watch again and again. The special effects-- the cutting in and out, flashing lights and images, etc... made it impossible to follow the story and feel the emotions of the characters. I was quite shocked when other renters of the video said that they didn't get into it. Now I know why. I am very disappointed with this version."
1,I can't believe I watched this entire movie.,"A friend at work kept talking about Moulin Rouge and how great it was, so I watched this. I cannot believe how much this movie sucked. Come to find out, my friend at work was talking about the actual show in Paris she saw several years ago when she was on vacation there. She agreed the movie version sucked. I wasted two hours of my life I could have spent practicing home dentistry or playing mumbletypeg barefoot."
1,In Top 10 Worst Movies of All Time!,"This movie was unbearable to watch! Two other people attempted to watch this movie with me and not one of us could stand it. We turned it off halfway through and regretted wasting money on this mess of a movie. We tried to give the movie a chance, but it was too horrible to keep watching. There were too many scenes with characters screaming and yelling their lines. Most actors were overacting, trying too hard to ""project."" It seems like the director wanted to attempt to resurrect the movie musical by updating a classic by applying pop music and MTV video styling. I do not recommend this mess."
2,Wierd,"I thought this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.Couldn't wait for it to be over. Nicole was pretty good in it, it was the story line that was just empty."
4,"Music Video for ""Lady Marmalade""? Help please!","I saw this movie on cable and liked it okay, but what I'm really looking for is the ""Lady Marmalade"" music video by Lil Kim, Pink, Agulara, and Mya. Would someone who owns this DVD please post here and let me know if it has the Lady Marmalade video? If not, please kindly point me to where I can purchase the said music video on DVD. Thank you very much in advance!"
2,Great songs but..,"With such an all-star cast, Moulin Rouge was one of the biggest movies released that year. However I'm one of those who disagree with the great ratings it received... There's nothing wrong with the acting... just the plot is so ridiculous and I felt silly watching it. It tries to be fairy-tale-like in an adult sort of way... to me these 2 just don't mix very well... I'd prefer either the one genre or the other. The songs were great remakes of old-time classics from musicals and bands, which I really enjoyed being a music lover myself. I think if not for the songs, I would have walked out of the movie 30 minutes into the show. Perhaps its true what people say : you either love this or hate this. Watch it at your own risk (of disappointment, of course)."
2,audio expirience,"as i was disgusted (!) by this movie as i saw the previews, and avoided it, i finally decided to rent it, to see how right i was.well, it [was bad]! but there is one good thing about it: SOUND!!!if you have a good home theater system, youre in for a ride!the sound quality is amazing, the film is fast and full of, well, intresting tracks.worth the 2$ rent."
5,It's All About Love At The Moulin Rouge,"Christian (McGregor) enters a world where dreams become true! A world of corruption and above all, Love! That world is in Paris and it's called ""The Moulin Rouge"".As Christian enters this world he meets the woman of all men's dreams. Satine (Kidman) is a beautyful, spectacular Showgirl at the Moulin Rouge. He can't resist her and falls deadly in love with that precious ""Diamond"".As the owner of the Moulin Rouge whants to buy Satine for him self he's ready to do everything to own her! He would even kill Christian to get his ""Sparkling Diamond"". As it seems as Satine would have no choice Christian tries to win her love back with all his power!A great Picture about Love, Truth, Freedom and Beauty at the Moulin Rouge! With a great Soundtrack and a spectacular Editing! Kidman is indead a ""Sparkling Diamond""!The most romantic and best Movie of this year!""Come and get me Boys!"""
1,IT BLOWS CHUNKS,Yuck! This movie is a waste of time and money. Not even seeing Nicole Kidman in scanty clothes is enough to drag this movie from the slime. Was it different from the usual formulaic tripe that passes for movie making nowadays? Yes. But was it good? The answer is a resounding NO! I would rather watch paint dry or grass grow. A TV Test pattern has as much interest as this movie.
1,...,"... but this musical (if you can call it that) is like everything you've seen before. It has a boring and predictable story, lousy singing and bad acting. The music is not new but bits and pieces of popular music from the past few decades. Computer generated special effects lend nothing to the show."
2,Drink coffee before you watch..,the first part of this movie is so confusing and boring that you may fall asleep. It gets better but not much. It's a silly time waster.
2,Obnoxious,"This has to be the most obnoxious film I've ever seen. The sets and costumes are visually stunning, but I felt the pace of the film to be manic to the point of being nauseating. I really, really tried to like this film, but ended up turning it off half way through."
3,like it or hate it,"I can see why people love this movie with its stunning visuals and usage of many famous songs. Its basically a musical made by taking the most famous songs of the past 50 years and linking them with a story. Or did they make the story first and then think of songs?And I can see why people hate this movie too. The pace is so frentic, and the camera angle constantly shifting... It reminded me of the Doors film of a few years back! It made me dizzy at time.This film is a decent modern musical made for the MTV generation. Is this a good idea? Well, you will probably either like it or hate it."
5,2001. Results. The best love story.,"I liked Romeo + Juliet and hoped that next Lurmann's picture wouldn't be worse. And it wasn't.It's very original musical and there are a lot of things about this side of the film, but...This is a story of love. Young poet and courtesan. Their life. Their fate. Their love. Above everything - there is only one thing. And it is love. The main thing in the world. And it is beautiful and light feeling even if it is a tragical love. Romeo + Juliet was about it. Moulin Rouge! was about it. And it is so great that in our pragmatic and cynical world there are people who understand, thatALL WE NEED IS LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Suffers badly from ADD --- where's the riddelin!?,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen in any Genre, this ""thing"" flits around like a major mental project. The ""writers"" filch bits and pieces of well-known pop-culture tunes and shove them into scenes randomly, and then only a line or two every couple of seconds. It can't justifyably be called a ""musical"". I'm glad I didn't shell out any money for this video (it was a well-intentioned gift), however I feel cheated as I wasted over 2 hours of precious time watching this drivel. In short: the story was trite and cliched, the singing was amateur, the acting laughable, and the effects were wasted.The fact that the average rating is 4 stars (as of this review) alarms me and causes me to fear for the course of our culture."
2,"Its Pretty, But...","As I say, its a very pretty movie, but it would have been nice had there been more to it. first time I watched it, I loved it. Second time, not so much. Now, I refuse to watch it again for fear of going into shock. Worth a watch, but didnt hold up to repeated viewings. Proves once again that covering a bad film with glitter and dancing girls does not change the essential stupidity of a bad film. Plot as predictable as a rock, in that it goes nowhere."
1,Huge Disappointment,"It's difficult to watch a movie supposedly taking place in the year 1899-1900 and hear Elton John, The Beatles and Madonna quoted. Sad, really. I watched the entire movie strictly because Craig Armstrong is such a brilliant composer. The original music is as I would expect from Mr. Armstrong. The movie was over the top--that's OK, but overall, very poor."
1,buy pepto to watch,"I will not damn this movie with faint praise, the movie just plain sucks. Although not the worst I've seen, I only suffered through it by fast forwarding (to see skin). It will be one of the ones I remember- to compare movies to. Their attempt at humor isn't, and gets worse after 300 repetitions. There are adult scenes, situations, violence, and drug use. Bad & boring."
1,Don't bother,"This movie has some original ideas, but unfortunately the finished product comes off very badly. This show tries to be a spectacle at every - and I mean EVERY - turn, at the expense of the film. Way too many special effects - you'll be hard pressed to find a single scene which doesn't use some sort of overly-lavish camera, computer or audio effect.Moulin Rouge runs at breakneck speed, constantly hitting you with some sort of extreme stimulus until it magically slows down for some random, cliche, saccharine-drenched love scene (horribly over-produced as well).I agree that this movie would have worked much better as a stage musical. But as a movie, it just tries too hard - WAY too hard."
1,bad musical,"What do you get when you mix Dr. Seuss characters with a Nirvana/Elton John/Madonna soundtrack, Nicole Kidman and John Leguizamo? A really bad movie. Guys, please, please realize that this ""movie"" has singing and dancing. Be forewarned that it is corny, stupid, predictable and boring."
2,"Give Verdi a chance, he is not that bad.","I thought this kind of junk could be found only on progressive opera houses. Forget about the plot. If you have seen La Traviata or Camille you've got it (including the spitting blood and the throwing of money to the courtesan in public, not to forget the recriminating old father). The formal originality consists on mixing a Ken Russell inflated musical with unrestrained bits from a Franco Zefirelli production. In the added material Nicole Kidman enlightens us about the moving force of this enterprise: love can be expressed in music better than in any other genre. The only advantage over La Traviata is that we are spared listening to 'Di Provenza il mare il sol', an aria I hate more than any other. Thanks to that I can honestly say that yes, I liked the music."
1,Waste of Time and Money,"My husband and I got through the first 15 minutes of this movie and turned it off. I cannot even describe why it is so bad. Lack of storyline, bad acting..to name a few.....Do not bother with this one!"
1,Not my type,"Too wild and scenes too busy. Can't keep my head from spinning. It is definitely different but can't say I enjoyed it. Just could not keep laughing at each other and thinking ""Why are we watching this?"""
2,Trying to resurrect the dinosaur,"Although it is evident that the filmmakers were making a valiant attempt to resurrect an extinct animal; film musical comedy, they have failed miserably. Perhaps it is an impossible task. Moulin Rouge is an indulgent mess, with a few wonderful sequences and performances (most notably by Ewan McGregor and Jim Broadbent, both of whom are quite good) Personally I am mystified by the film's appeal. Kidman and Leguizamo are both way over the top, the story is much too simplistic and the dance sequences are unfocused and dull. I would very much like Luhrmann to take a look at an earlier film of his ""Strictly Ballroom"" and take a lesson from it. Maybe going back to his roots (as they say) might help him create something worthwhile.Although not as dreadful as his Romeo and Juliet, Moulin Rouge is still a failure. I can not recommend it to any but the least discriminating viewer."
1,UGH!!!!!,this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my whole entire life! It dragged on and on! The best part was when it was over! There a few good parts but not good enough to even rent the movie! It was so stupid and corny everyone was dancing around and singing and in a way it's kind of scary with all the wierd props and actors with wierd make-up! I thought it would be more!
1,Short-attention-span theater,"Frenetic, derivative, and utterly superficial. Luhrmann should stick to meatier scripts (I greatly enjoyed 'Romeo and Juilet'). Injection of Top 40 lyrics every six and a half minutes coupled with an absolute ceiling of 6 seconds per shot gives the edited work all the appeal of chewing gum. Can't fault the cast, choreographers, etc., as this was obviously a failure of writing, direction, editing, and possibly cinematrography.Sober and bored, I bailed in under a half an hour."
1,Beautiful but meaningless.,"I found Moulin Rouge a brilliant technical exercise, but completely without any meaning or any kind of good drama. All I could ask myself watching this DVD is...why? I wish the director would concentrate more on telling a strong dramatic story (like ""Romeo & Juliet""), rather than trying to asault his audience with MTV quick cutting indulgent ""coolness"" that masks how shallow this film really is when you look beneath its glittery surface."
5,The Return of an Old Genre,I completely agree that this movie reestablishes and remakes the old and forgotten but such important Hollywood genre of musical theatre. Don't forget that the director who also did Strictly Ballroom and Romeo and Juliette studied Bollywood spectacle in order to make Moulin Rouge. I fall in love with this movie time and again.
1,Disappointing,"Neither my husband nor I enjoyed this movie. It was too fragmented, like looking into a kaleidoscope, although with a kaleidoscope, one can at least freeze the image long enough to get a good look at it. And who could care about these characters? Bring back ""Gigi."" Bring back ""My Fair Lady."" Bring back Astaire and Rogers."
1,wow!,"this movie was absolutely horrible...it made no sense and was just too weird...i mean, c'mon, they were singing madonna and nirvana songs in 1899??? nah."
1,Truly disappointed,"We were looking forward to a movie with passion and excitement, and got a musical with songs that were out of place and not sung very well either. Imagine the scene set around 1900 and the songs that are sung are from today's music. None of the dance/music pieces were long enough to grab the viewer, more like abbreviated clips. Nicole Kidman is beautiful but she can't sing well enough for a musical. The first half of the movie was so confusing and boring, and the exaggerated theatrics of the characters were too much. Acting does not involve screaming your lines with emphasis on the end of the sentences. Ziegler, the theater director, is annoying, and Ewan, the male romance interest, was bland. The last 1/3 of the movie was better, but not enough to save it. It was disappointing because the premise behind the movie could have created something wonderful."
1,"Walk out of this movie, it'n not worth anyone's time",This movie fails to describe the main Argument and doesn't follow any stroy. It is filled with modern music and fast camera movements whcih distracts viewers from concentarting on the subject. This movie is not worth the 1 hr and 30 minutes that it demands from the audience. It is one of the WORST movies I've ever seen!
2,Absinthe does not make the heart grow fonder,"This campy unnatural telling of the simplest of love stories does not rise to the promised bohemian heights of beauty, freedom, truth and love. Nevertheless, a triumph of style over substance is still a triumph of sorts. Don't forget to check out the green fairy!"
1,Wish I could give it NO stars,"I hated this movie, couldn't even sit through the whole thing. I turned it off half-way through and have no desire to go back and see what I missed. It was trite and nonsensical and the ""singing"" was abysmal. I may have enjoyed it more had I watched it with the sound turned off but not MUCH more... They would have done better to use unknowns that had actual singing talent. F. Awful."
1,An Insult to the Real Moulin Rouge,"This movie was so stupid, I turned it off after the first 15 minutes. I'm half French, and I can say that this movie completely destroys the class and elegance of the real theatre. And to top it off I can't believe anyone had the brains to nominate it for an Oscar. (Probably drank Absinth stright up)Anyone who's been to the real Molin Rouge in Paris will see that this is completely off base. There are no fat people in the show, everyone sits at tables and not dance around. The place has a lot of high standards.It's supposed to be set in 1900, yet they have a lot of modern music like Smells Like Teen Spirit by Nirvana? Hello, the director and the writer shoud be dragged out in the street and shot!If you are stupid enough to believe that this is what really goes on at the Moulin Rouge I got a nice piece of land on Mars to sell you. Don't waste your money on this load of crap and go to Paris instead!!"
1,What were they thinking?,"I bought this DVD at the urging of a trusted reviewer. While I was entranced by the imaginative cuts and effects during the beginning credits, my companion and I were immediately turned off by the extreme over-acting. Yes, I've been cautioned that this technique was used to satisfy the intended theatrical effect. However, in my opinion, the desired effect was dreadful, distracting, and irritating. Only the first 10 minutes of my DVD was ever touched by a laser. Unless you're a masochist, save your money."
2,?,"whacked out and hard to follow. In other words your wife/girlfriend will love it. Watch it while your tripping and it might be good, but sober its insanely boring."
5,Pure Entertainment at it's finest,"This movie will knock your socks off! My face was smiling and my heart was singing throughout the entire film. What a wild ride of amazing color, music, and cinematography! GO see this film and be absolutely delighted!"
1,WOW!,"""I've got a great idea for a movie! It'll be a musical, with MTV sensibilities...jump cuts, frantic camerawork and get this... it'll utilize period inappropriate music...modern pop music in 1900 Paris.""This movie will find a place in the ""Worst conceived musical"" section in the local video store next to 1978's ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" It may well become a camp / cheeze classic but friends...the emperor has no clothes.Avoid"
5,Takes your breath away..,"The amazing thing about this movie is that all the critiques are true, and it doesn't matter. There is no plot, really, and no character development to speak of, and no one will win an Oscar for the acting, I don't think.And yet, this movie does not overcome these traditional stumbling blocks, it transcends them. It is simply breathtaking and needs no rationalization. Would that more things in life were as utterly without purpose and as beautiful."
5,Wow!!,"Wow,""Moulin Rouge"" was a great movie. I can still rember it for 4 months ago. This movie is really a must see. Worth the rental when the DVD comes out...no wait worth buying it!"
3,Ambitious and different,"This movie is very ambitious, but that isn't always a good thing, like a rival politician that has different views. Every frame of film is lush and electrified, every sound edit larger then life. A true musical, though I was not aware of this when my wife purchased it. It shows elements of Cabaret and Rocky Horror and its very own taste of bizarre. The plot is simple enough underneath it all as most musicals are, ala any later Elvis movie, but it proved to me to be a tough pill to swallow. It is like watching ""The Wall"" by Pink Floyd but wanting something lighter. It is a larger than life experience that you will love or hate, and that says something about it. For me personally it was to convoluted and lost in its excess, but I could see that this could be someone's favorite movie that they would defend with very good reason. It definitely is cinematic art, you just got to ask yourself what mood you are in before you watch it."
3,Not Your Typical Musical,"I'm a big fan of musicals, and it's taking me a while to get used to MR. They used so many different types of existing songs, the whole movie seems very disjointed. My husband likes the way Nicole Kidman looks in the movie, but we both agree that she's not a strong singer. The love story is nice. There are some very funny moments, and I think it's easier to watch if you don't take the movie too seriously.In spite of my mixed feelings about the movie itself, the DVD is great. I love the way they did the ""behind the scenes."" If you've seen the movie and know you like it, you definitely should buy the DVD."
5,Best Love Story.,This one of the cornerstone films for people who appreciate a beautiful love story that duplicates itself as a Shakespearan tale of Tragedy/Comedy/Love. Baz Luhrman is a GENIUS!
5,A really great all around film.,"I really love this movie because its got many different things going for it. Baz is a great filmmaker the way he presents the story is wonderful. The whole dark scenario of the movie is simply great. I mean you've got True Love, music, and Death, what more could anyone ask for?"
1,"B-b-but, he isn't wearing anything!","Upon finally watching this movie, I felt like I was seeing the emperor's new clothes. I had heard all the hype, and was expecting at least an original, interesting experience. Alas, it was actually painful to watch. Aside from Nicole and Ewan, who were certainly troupers, and had better singing voices than I expected, the movie was just one long, noisy piece of self-indulgence for the director."
1,What a load of [junk]!,"This is one of the WORST of ""good"" movies of all time! Just the sight of Nicole Kidman lipcynching to ""Like A Virgin"" and poor, brilliant old Jim Broadbent lipsynching his way through some 90s dance tune was enough to turn my stomach. WHat were people thinking??!! How did the creators succeed in pitching this movie to the studio? As far as ""good"" movies go (meaning, well made and big budget with lots of support from the critics), this ranks right up there ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""Eyes Wide Shut""! It is truly horrible. Painful to sit through. If you want a movie musical, pick almost anything else in the whole wide world. Definitely pass on this one."
1,Love it or hate it...........,"I sat down to watch this film, as my girlfriend loves it, and I had heard quite a few things about it, at both ends of the spectrum. After sitting through two hours of an awful story that was blatantly lifted from ""Shakespeare in Love,"" I was in a bad mood. I realized I had seen what I consider to be one of the three worst films of all time. Now, people who are more into visuals and less into story will like this, as the visuals are fairly interesting. The music was interesting, since it was one medley after another, but I didn't find any of them very compelling or moving. The cast was great, but couldn't do much with such a cliche script. If I had my choice, I'd bury the master reel of this film at the bottom of the ocean, and pray that no other human has to endure the two hours of spoon fed schlock that I did. Some will claim to enjoy this film, but I just can't see how. It's reall, really bad."
1,Not worth paying any price!,"We rented it, thank God. Baz Luhrman has the Midas touch in reverse (if you can imagine what I mean). What a waste of young, lovely talent (Nicole Kidman) and the gifted Ewan McGregor. A fertile topic, Moulin Rouge and the delicious city of Paris that was wasted by Luhrman. His is a name we will avoid in the future. But why write more? ..."
5,Spectacular! Spectacular!,"Baz Luhrmann's musical masterpiece is a mind-blowing spectacle of color, music and genius. From the black and white poverty-stricken streets of Paris to the frenzied can-can dancing inside the club Mouling Rouge, this film had me mesmerized every second. I've noticed many people seem to flinch at the frenzied scene changes and peculiar soundtrack. Indeed, this movie is strange.. That's what I love about it. It doesn't adhere to the rules. It's different and daring and I believe people will get a lot more out of it if they sit back and just go with it. Enjoy it...don't question it. Allow yourself to be swept away from reality and absorbed into this alternate Bohemian world. Experience the magic of Moulin Rouge."
1,Oscar nomination?? Why on earth for?,I could not wait to see this movie.You get lured in by certain takes in the pre-vieuws and by the music. Of course the costumes where great. The whole story is like a running joke of existing songs and a love story nobody really cares for. Truly it is now questionable whyso many other good movies do not get the nominations they deserve. Why was this one even mentioned?????Hopefully this dusty old Oscar institution will be modernized.Why not involve the largest group of judges: the public.
1,Pathetic Excuse for a Movie,"This is an absolutely abysmal movie. During the early moments of the film I kept thinking surely it will break out of this intolerable and convoluted visionary and musical mess and give us intelligent film-making. It never did. How on earth this film has garnered any of the awards or nominations it has is beyond me. To attempt to juxtapose turn of the century Paris with Elton John and Madonna lyrics as well as references to tunes such as The Beatles' ""All You Need Is Love"" and the Sweet's ""Love is Like Oxygen"" is utterly ridiculous. Watching this film, or attempting to watch it (I made it only about half way through it), is an absolutely tortuous undertaking.Don't waste your time on this wretched mess!!!"
1,I wish I could give this film less than one star,"This vile piece of schlock brings new meaning to the phrase ""Please, make it stop!"" Its vapid, mundane, cliched plot makes me want to retch. The acting was inferior to that of Mrs. Johnson's kindergarten class' production of ""Gary the Bravest Tooth"". There are plot holes you could ride a big glowing elephant through, and the only entertaining moment occurs when Nicole Kidman's two-dimensional, unholy character dies to the relief of the audience who by that point is embarrassed to have paid perfectly good money to watch that wretched drivel."
2,What's the big deal?,"I just saw this stupid movie. I should have waited even longer than I did. The music is from a trash bin and the acting sucks. Only the ""Like A Virgin"" scene is any good. Don't waste your time or movie."
1,"No story, No plot",What a waste of film. A total waste of time to watch. No entertaining at all. There is no plot and there is no story to follow. If you like noise and confusion then you'll love this movie. Don't bother with this movie. I can't overstate this enough that this movie totally and thoroughly stinks!
1,Another vote for crap,"It looks great, it sounds great, it does nothing for me at all. It goes nowhere, and it couldn't interest me in the characters at all. Cardboard cutouts have more personality. The storyline simply wasn't there. My ruler has more twists. Had I seen it in the theatre, I would have walked out and gone and seen whatever was playing in the next room. If you love musicals and are amused by rhe constant recyling of old pop music lyrics in a new context, by all means, you'll love this one, but before you buy it, rent it. It's very easy not to like. We hit stop with over an hour remaining, and I don't expect we'll put it back in the DVD player."
1,Nothing but random scenes and songs tossed together,"""Moulin Rouge""is nothing but a bunch of random scenestossed together with random songs slapped on.The costumeswere from different eras,too(like the 1920's showgirl costumes).If this is supposed to take place in 1900,why are therethings like 1930's style buildings and songs that camefrom the 40's,50's and 60's?The guy in the ringmasteroutfit was terribly out-of-place for a club like that-itlooks like someone yanked him out of a circus tent andstuck him at the nightclub/bar.The actors yell their linesinstead of just talking normally,and the acting is WAYoverdone.I don't remember who directed this movie,but they dida horrible job!The only thing this movie has going for it isthe songs.That's all.If you want ""Moulin Rouge"",I suggest justbuying the CD,and forget about seeing the movie."
1,Narcissistic Pretentious Grandstanding,"What a Bomb ! What personal insecurity leads ""Baz"" Luhrmann tomake such a piece of pretentious grandstanding ? And why doeshe call himself ""Baz"" ? Isn't Baz a discredited slang name forBarry that was rarely used in Australia in the 1960s ?What does a song about New Orleans have to do with Paris ? TheFrench must hate this film, if for no other reason than the factthat the French have reasonably good taste in pop music - unlikeAustralia and the USA. The awful, banal whitebread music on thisfilm is typical to what one gets on dreadful Australian andAmerican radio - and the public loves it. Pity."
1,Somebody wake me up!,"People say all the time the words, ""This is the worst movie I've ever seen!"" Well I can honestly say that about this movie. I must have missed something because it made no sence. Its like the director had alot of creative ideas and instead of trying to create a plot, he just crammed all of these ideas and creative scenes into a movie! I was bored out of my mind sitting through this thing. Did you ever have a bad dream in which alot of things crazy things happened that didnt make any sence? Thats exactly what this movie was like, a bad dream."
1,About as bad as bad as it gets,"What amazes me most about this film was that it did so much right.Was it visually stunning? Indeed.Was the acting good? It was great. I didn't believe Nicole Kidman could give such a performance. I still think a stunt-double must have done the acting parts for her.Unfortunately, no amount of polish can make up for the fact that the framework of this film is rotten. The story is completely uninspired. And the songs, well... let's just say I was expecting to hear the cast break out into a Boz Scaggs tune at any time (that's NOT a compliment).It amazes me that anyone could find this film enjoyable, and that is not sarcasm."
1,SAVE YOUR $$$$$$$$$,"What is the big deal with this movie?!? I've had more fun at the dentist. I could only stand it for 30 minutes. I knew it would be a musical- the music is ok. But the story is not good, the camera shots are bizarre, and it is an overall annoying movie. It was really out-there like a Clockwork Orange. If this is supposed to be a great artistic movie, then I am happy with made-for television movies."
1,Watch out! The frame has been cropped!,"Yes. It is widescreen, but cropped from the original 2.35:1 format to 1.85:1.When will the manufacturers learn that DVD users want the CORRECT theater frame ratio, whatever it is?"
1,Candy Coated Nothing,"From the moment the credits started rolling to the moment they (thankfully) stopped, this overblown and hideous assault on the senses never truly wowed beyond a whimper (as in ""please stop the madness!"") The singing was terrible, the songs were rehashed and misplaced pop tunes (Ewan McGregor, grinning and slinking his way through ""Your Song"" by Elton John nearly destroyed my love of the tune), and the storyline was as thin as tissue paper. My whole family hated it, so one might argue that our dislike of the film is genetic; however, I've run into others to whom I'm not related who also roundly despise this costly puff of fluff. The only reason it averages 4 stars at Amazon, I believe, is because those of us who disliked it simply can't stand to think about it anymore, thereby keeping us from bothering to write about it. However, here's my 1 star, and if I could give it none, I would."
2,"""Weird, But Not In A Good Way""","There's much talk that Luhrmann has created something new with this mishmash, the postmodern musical. Actually, he's a latecomer if such were his intention. The brilliant under-appreciated ""Pennies From Heaven,"" with Bernadette Peters and Steve Martin, either of whom can act and sing circles around Kidman and McGregor, is the film that actually deserves the ravesthis tiresome eyesore is now unjustly receiving. A gilded lily, ""Moulin Rouge"" is proof patent that too much of a good thing can be far, far less than wonderful."
2,cliche' hell,"You are DOOMED TO CLICHE' HELL for the duration of this campy ""minority group"" film. Justwhen you think this overworked cliche' is over, they MERCILESSLY PACKANOTHER ONE IN (cliche', that is), leaving you DOUBLED OVER with dismay."
1,I've seen better on lower budgets.,"Rent it, don't buy it. Not something I've watch again anytime soon."
1,I Gave This Movie 1 Star because There was Nothing Lower!!!,"This movie is horrible. If you like a chaotic mess of unimaginative song, choppy story lines and you just really need to waste 3 hours, then I urge you to run, not walk, and get this DVD. I watched the entire thing just to be if it could possibly get any worse, and it did! I don't know what everyone was fussing about, this movie is just plain horrible and in my opinion, the worse movie I've seen in about 10 years!"
2,uh. . . hello?,"A question I'd like to pose to the admirers of this film and it's DVD counterpart: Amongst the *Goodies* found on the double disk release, was ""The Story"" (or ANY story or narrative, for that matter) found anywhere? Maybe tucked away in some of the storyboards? Maybe in some obscure Easter Egg?I give the movie two stars primarily for the fine, sharp cinematography of Donald McAlpine and beautiful production design by Catherine Martin, but the director Baz Luhrmann, though a very capable producer (having birthed this 127 minute long MTV video), is cleary suffering from ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" syndrome. And so it seems are most who fawn over this paean to Attention Deficit Disorder."
1,This is terrible,"Never in my life have I seen such a piece of garbage. I heard good reviews about it from my friends, and so I decided to check it out. I cannot believe this is averaging 4.5 stars. I wish I could give this piece of junk a zero. This is the worst plot and worst acting I have seen for some time. I honestly cannot think of a worse movie on this entire earth. Trust me, this blows. Absolutely HORRID."
1,A hodge-podge of stuff!,"This IS a ""like or dislike"" movie. I'm on the dislike side. All the talk about ""Moulin Rouge"" bringing back the musical genre is a bunch of hooey. The songs are relatively recent songs originally recorded by Elton John, Madonna, etc., and with these non-singers attempting them adds even more irritation to watching and listening to this film. The acting is okay, but I don't think it's breakthrough for anyone. After all the hype--and I do like ""true"" musicals (original songs, etc.)--I was completely disappointed. In fact, I watched it a second time to see if I was missing something. I didn't. Those who praise this movie as a musical haven't seen the great musicals of the past."
2,Can(t) Can(t) at the Moulin Rouge,"I really wanted to like this film. After seeing it, I'm astonished it made Official Selection at Cannes. On the bright side, the art direction is very good. I love the colors, typography and some of the special effects... to an extent. The storyline is so riduculous that it comes across as late-show camp. The film's downside is enhanced by unlikeable characters and pathetic overacting. What is especially irritating though are the song and dance numbers. Mixing pop music with a peroid drama is an interesting idea but executed, it just doesn't work."
1,Frenetic and Frenzied,"This is a film that you will either really love or realy hate; there is no in between. I really hated it, and like a fool, I bought it based on the critics enthusiam for it without viewing it first. I truly cannot understand why the critics raved about it. I lost interest in the film in the first 20 minutes, but stuck with it to the very last to see if there was anything redeeming about this ""musical."" There was not. From the first surreal, frenzied, overpowering production number to the last breath of the heroine, it was a mish-mash of nothing more than whirling colors, music that drowned out the vocals, and pathetic acting. This director should stick to MTV music videos. Some critics have said that this film is the ""new musical genre for the 21st century""....I sincerely hope not!! What a waste of time and money!"
1,Soundbites ala carte,"Nothing more than a remade series of clips from musicals from the last 50 years along with remade modern music. All of it set to a visually bombastic series of vignettes which is nothing if it isn't post 20th century hollyweird. Period piece? forget about it. A bastardization and a not very entertaining one, you got it. The only thing entertaining was the rapid pace which left you wondering what it was you'd just seen. And then you realize that it doesn't matter cause nothing about it hangs together nor was it intended to.Since I do know something and I'm no longer in school it was a complete waste of 16 bucks."
2,Is your local video store out of copies of Moulin Rouge?,"No problem. Just rent anything else, eat 6 candy bars, drink a case of Coke, and be sure to watch whatever you rent on fast forward. There, you have the general experience. Try to have a few photos of Nicole Kidman nearby, too, to calm yourself down occasionally. To be fair, the film must have been a nightmare to make and edit, and Luhrmann has done an estimable job with that, but it's ultimately one of those experiments that I'm not sure anyone had to really make. If AMPAS had to give this film any Oscar attention, it should've acted in reverse. No nomination for Best Movie, but a nomination for Best Director."
4,Love this movie,I was not sure about this movie but when I watched it. Wow amazing!The music and visual just were breathtaking.
1,sheep,"Thats what you are if you pretend to enjoy this ""film"". A sheep. The media pretends that they are so sophisticated and ""arty"" and that anybody with any sense would just love this movie. Wrong. The only reason anyone would pretend to like it is because musicals are supposed to be ""arty"" and the media tells you it's good. How could you enjoy this? So boring, none of the actors can sing, and the plot and dancing are so [bad]. If you want to watch this just so you can pretend to love it and tell your friends about it, then just rent it. Don't actually buy the DVD, it's just totally jam-packed with a bunch of stuff that no self loving person would actually watch, or actually buy."
1,Don't waste your time,"What a mind-bending piece of eye candy! Aside from the fact that our heroine dies very gracefully, despite the fact she has tuberculosis- a particularly nasty disease indeed, the modern soundtrack had the annoying habit of yanking the audience out of the story back into the present. With that in mind, it was extremely difficult to ""suspend disbelief."" I wanted to like it, but it was just a garbage movie."
1,"Insipid, anachronistic claptrap","I've heard SO many people say that a person will either love or hate ""Moulin Rouge."" I absolutely hate it.I have nothing against movie musicals (""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" was *really* the best movie of last year), but this barely even qualifies. The once-contemporary, beat-into-the-ground pop songs just didn't work for me in the turn-of-the-century setting.A complete waste of Ewan McG's talent.And I'm not even going to go into the blasphemy of ""Lady Marmalade"" by all those skanky women in the video... ::shudder:"
2,Not everything is better in blu-ray,"I love the movie Moulin Rouge, I saw it twice on the big screen and many times on the regular 'ol DVD. So I thought the blu-ray version would be stunning. It is-but not in a good way. The movie is already bright and garish by it's nature. The blu-ray makes the colors too loud, too garish. It's obnoxious. The final number where Satine dies is awful, the colors are just wrong. I won't watch it again. Major bummer."
1,Didn't work,The order came on time but when I tried to play it in my DVD player it wouldn't work. I tried a different DVD player thinking it was just that one but the same thing happened. Each time an error message popped up saying wrong region. The disc was made for the UK and won't play in America.
1,Does not even work,Horrible! Popped it in pressed play And nothing Waiste of my money I was very disappointed that this movie did not work
1,most overrated film of the year,"I have read the glowing terms that other reviewers have used to describe this film, and I am amazed. I don't care how ""groundbreaking"" the attempt was, the resulting film was so disjointed and boring that it was only the second film in my life that I could not sit through. After a half hour of it, I had to turn it off. This was the first DVD I tried to watch on my new player, and it was so bad that I had to go and rent another one just to take the bad taste out of my mouth."
4,Strange But Good,"I must confess that in the first 10 minutes I thought of walking out. But luckly I made the better decision to give it a chance and I think that's what everyone should do while watching this movie. Sure it's wierd, but that's the point. This movie is supposed to be different. I really did like it a lot. The music is very moving and the performances are pitch perfect. Believe me, musicals are not easy to pull off. Their chemistry is very romantic and heartbreaking. I will also warn you though. The direction is EXTREMELY fast and choppy and that's why I took off 1 star. Other than that I totally recommend this movie. Just be prepared for something different and unusual and you will love it!"
3,Petition: more info about this product needed.,Is this the single-disc or double-disc edition of the DVD movie?
4,Fantastic,"Moulin Rouge is a definite hit. The bright colors will leave you spinning and the wonderful music will leave you swooning. It's a little hard to follow at first, but the beautiful voice of Ewan McGregor is worth the entire movie itself."
4,Great movie; dreadful widescreen version.,"This movie is even better than its publicity. The color, music and acting by the stars are all above average. The writing for the secondary cast is poorly done. The widescreen version is one of the worst yet. The horizontal black bands take up as much space as the picture, even on a very large TV. The supplemental disc, not in the same widescreen, is superb all the way around and almost worth the price by itself."
3,A Movie on Crack,"First off, I was ... misled ... The previews in no way suggested that this movie would be a musical. Although visually pleasing, the bits and pieces of pop music scattered throughout the movie was somewhat disconcerting. I just couldn't get used to it. It might have been a bit better if I would have known whether most of the movie was meant to be joking or serious. I swear, every time they burst into a remade pop song, I was waiting for a punch line only to be confused when there wasn't any. I am assuming the ""Like a Virgin"" scene was a joke, and, although I now find it hilarious, the first time I saw the movie I was so confused as to whether the director was joking and trying to make the audience laugh, or if he was in earnest ... I would have just given this movie two stars, but for one reason. The remake or ""Roxanne"" was so poinient and so well done I would buy the movie just for that."
2,Reviews by FreaK,"Well, what can I say, it isn't very good. The music was great, and I liked the costume design, but the story *cringes* is different...it didn't make much sense at all. I would expect better with Nicole Kidman, but it isn't good, that is all I have to say I guess. It was up for best picture, but isn't nearly as good as A Beautiful Mind or Lord of the Rings."
4,Very interesting movie!,"This is a fun singalong movie. The music selections are fabulous, the casting is well done & it's a very creative movie!"
5,Super-Amazing!,"I'm a music fan. I love all tipes of music, but did not like show music so much. After watching Moulin Rouge, that perception changed. Moulin Rouge has the best soundtrack ever, and after watching it more than 5 times, I decided to get the two soundtracks to the movie. Any music fans out there, Moulin Rouge is one of the best musicals ever!!"
4,Broadway in you own living room,"One of the Best movies of it's year.Every moment, sink or swim, feels infused with love of showmanship, love of highwire creativity and love for the cinema itself. Moulin Rouge is probably not a perfect film, but the cinema is first and foremost a visual medium.Jody Bissoon"
1,Maybe the Worst of 2001?,"Ok...maybe not the worst movie of 2001..but the worst of the ones I saw. I tried to give it another chance on DVD. I can now say it was the worst DVD I have so far seen in 2002. The story line..and I use the phrase loosely..is so bland that it will put you to sleep.It did have great photography though it was the one area in which this film could be termed outstanding. This film is a great example of why the musical, in film form, died. If this film is an attempt to bring it back, well they surely have failed. Leave the musicals to Broadway and live productions and spare us the film makers attempts at so called ""art"". This was a very hard film for me to take as I am a big Nicole Kidman fan. Most of my friends would say I would pay [money] to watch her brush her teeth for 2+ hours...."
2,This is MTV hell,"Nicole & Ewan do terrific impersonations of Ann-Margret & Donny Osmond. Respectively, by the way. Very Vegas."
5,A Movie Musical Experience!,"The Moulin Rouge movie and DVD are works of art! Even the box is very artistic. I have not been a big fan of the movie musical, but this movie has risen to the top of my list.After seeing the movie in the theater, I immediately wanted to see it again because there is so much to see in many scenes. The songs blend so well with the story that you can tell what's happening in the movie when you hear the song. The acting, singing, and choreography are breath-taking.The DVD provides bonus features such as music videos, the HBO Making feature, and a Behind the Red Velvet Curtain version to learn about the history and technology.Although it's a sad movie, it's invigorating to watch and provides an inspiring theme of truth, beauty, freedom, and most of all LOVE!"
5,Excellent..not for the Morons,"Whoever dubs this not a ""true"" musical is blind.The music in this film is beyond words...no, it's not original writing, but I surely couldn't have brought some of the best songs together in such a format.Were we to BELIEVE that this music actually took place in Paris, 1900?? NO! It was genius to say the least.This movie is over the top in every single way...and I think you really need to have that mindset to begin with to appreciate it.I loved it...I was glued to the screen the entire time..marvelling at the effects, the costumes, the music...it made me cry, and that says it all.Put your realism aside and absorb the beauty of this movie."
3,My favorite movie on a disappointing Blu-Ray,"Moulin Rouge is one of my all-time favorite movies. I've watched the hell out of the DVD, and vowed to pick up the title as soon as it hit Blu-Ray. Well, I did just that, and have been seriously disappointed by the release. The video claims to have been remastered and ""Approved by Baz Lurman"", but half of this disc seems to have been mastered out of focus. The contrast is muddier, the colors aren't quite as vibrant as they should be, there is quite a bit of noise in many of the dark/slow-motion shots. Half the time, Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor feel blurry and out of focus, even though the surrounding scenery might be sharp. Did Baz approve this transfer by checking it on an iPod? I've also seen this film in the theater several times and I don't remember the film prints having this many issues.Unless you are a huuuuge fan, do yourself a favor and stick with the special edition DVD of this movie."
1,WOW!... PURE TORTURE!,"Now I know what TRUE madness it. The theatre was empty during this whole movie from so many people walking out. I am appalled at the amount of people giving this good reviews. I guess everyone praises movies that drive them crazy so much to the point where they start to believe they like it!I've never seen such a flawed movie in my life. What's all thisabout a standing ovation and clapping between numbers? Gimme a break.2001 was the worst year ever for movies. The best one out of allof them was ""Bandits.""I suggest this movie to people who also enjoy having teeth pulled out and walking on fire-hot coals. You'll have a blast with this one."
1,A Bad Flick,"From beginning to end this movie went from bad to worse. The directing, acting and music were some of the worse I have ever seen."
1,Horrible,I hated this movie. The plot isn't original and the acting was terrible. Give me a break people this movie was lame!
1,Utter and Complete Garbage,"Most reviewers giving this ""film"" a 5-star rating concede ""either you love it or you hate it"". This is true, just as you either have a brain or you don't. Watching this movie was like watching hyperactive 8 year-olds on speed doing some sort of sock-puppet routine in front of the mirror. It boggles the mind that some talented actors (and I don't mean Leguizamo) participated in this nonsense. And about Leguizamo....what drug would cause someone's brain to choose him to play Toulouse-Lautrec?"
2,Too contemporary for the period.,"Loved the costumes, especially the lingerie but I was not satisfied with the historical presentation of that decade, Moulin Rouge. The music was too contemporary for that particular time, the 1890s. I thought it would have been a drama based musical centering around the night club life. But my expectations were not as what I predicted it to be. This movie may have garnered the respect and high praise of the critics but to some viewers, it wasn't that great."
1,Aaack! Doesn't even deserve a full star!,"Oh this movie was horrible! I 100% agree with Dr. Ravna (see review below)--this movie was awful, awful, awful. Even though I was impressed with the vocal talent of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, I don't know how anybody liked it, and I do not understand how it possibly won the awards it has. I only know one person who liked it (and more because she's a fan of Nicole Kidman and Christina Aguilera who sang the title track along with 3 others) but everyone else that I know, ranging from children to professionals detested this despicible waste of time, money, and effort. In short, it's much to glitzy, fake, uncomfortable, awkward, unwatchable, and unbearable. I don't care if the whole world disagrees with me--I will never subject myself to this cinematic atrocity again!"
1,A Big Disappointment,"I am a Nicole Kidman fan. I like the soundtrack to Moulin Rouge. However, I must say this is the most ill-directed, ill-conceieved piece of trash to come out of Hollywood in the past seventy-five years. The ""plot"" is assinine. The characters are weak. What passes for cinematography is at best wretched. Don't waste your money. Don't even waste your time."
1,Arrrrggghhh!,"Okay, first off I would like to say that these oh so referentially hip and ironic types pieces of pop culture fluff are wearing dreadfully thin. The singing in this film is amateurish, but I could have dealt with that (as I did in ""Everyone Says I Love You"".) The visuals are pretty, but they are candy and are ultimately empty images. The story is a pure drag with terribly slow pacing for having such hyperactive editing techniques. The acting is truly awful, from all parties involved. I could not suffer through this turgid movie one more time. Maybe if you dig on movies like ""Shrek"" and ""10 things I hate about you"", this is your kind of flick. Or maybe if you like cinematography for it's own sake you will like the stylishness of the shots. I found this movie aggravating to no end. Oh, yeah....the arrangements under the singing were awful as well."
1,You love it or you hate it,"This looks like one of those movies that people either love or hate. I won't say I hated it, but I sure didn't love it. It's too busy, frantic and noisy. The story is pretty thin and predictable. The characters are mostly caricatures. Some of the musical numbers were quite entertaining but overall, I felt that this was aimed at the viewer with a short attention span and a high tolerance for visual pyrotechnics."
5,this movie has it all,"The new Moulin Rouge has got everything that makes a movie entertaining and a joy to watch; it's funny, romantic, sad(take your tissues). All the people in it are people you like-even the ""bad guy"" is a fine/funny fellow.This is going to be-in spite of the bad press-a classic keeper that will be bought by the people who seem to be right about movies much more often than the ""critics""who get it wrong so often that I wonder anyone ever pays any attention to them.I personally use them as a barometer;what they pan I go see, what they are esctatic about I shun.This is just another example of how wrong they can be."
5,more than meets the eye?,"I LOVED this movie! Not only was it a huge, fun, campy extravaganza the entire way through, with excellent music to boot, there were things in it that I normally love in theatre or musical productions which most movies seem to lack. For example, the oddity of the cinematogrophy--the dreaminess of some parts, the obvious lip-synching, and other things you may pick up on--are because the entire thing is through the memory of the narrator. Sometimes in a movie you see only what the main character sees; in this one, the bias and fuzziness of memory are added. In a stage when most of what we get from Hollywood seems to ride on action/violence and sexuality and little else (not that this one doesn't have some of both, especially the latter), Moulin Rouge stands out."
2,I love Baz...,"...but I really didn't like this film. I found it boring & slow, melodramatic (hammy acting) & without heart. Sorry, but it just didn't move me! I loved ""William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet"" and was therefore really disappointed with this effort."
1,Does Mary Poppins ring a bell?!?,"This movie has the look and feel of a Disney animation/live action movie. The plot and the storyline are very similar to Disney movies. Even the singing reminds of animation films like The Lion King. This is a kid's movie. The only part I liked is almost at the ending where Satine and the Duke have to 'consummate' their relationship. For the rest it's pretty bland and unsurprising and that counts for photography, story and setting. I recommend Terry Gilliam movies if you want some real substance."
1,Amateur Night at the Moulin Rouge,"What a dreadful bore! The director should have been fired or given serious psychiatric help. Moulin Rouge reminded me of a high school production with a huge budget. Memorable music? Oh, give me a break! It was an embarassment except for a few fleeting moments of inspiration."
2,I disagree with most of the comments about this movie,"I saw this movie on DVD last night and I don't think that it was all that great as other people have commented on it. First I could not understand why they didn't come up with original music, they had to borrow from ""The Sound of Music."" Are they kidding? Diamonds are Girl's Best Friend? And when did rap come in to play in the 1900's? The camera action was so fast I had to go in to slow play to see what I had missed.I had to turn the volume up to hear what the actors were sayingand then when the music came on it was so loud and I had to turn it down. Actors should take alocution lessons and learn to project their lines so we can understand what they are saying. And as for their singing, Nicole and Ewan sounded like two wimps.Well others may like it, but I am from the old school when musicals were made to be entertaining and the voices could be heard."
1,sensory overload,"I did not enjoy this movie at all. There was sensory overload from the beginning of the film - with gaudy costumes, overacting, loud music, and no central theme. I did not find myself attached to the film - rather I wanted to fast forward through many of the scenes, particularly the singing ones (which practically encompass the whole movie).This movie was disconcerting on all levels. I would have rather watched the movie in mute than listen to the singing dialogue."
3,"Visually satisfying, Musically disappointing","This movie is just as color-saturated and overflowing visually as most reviews have stated. The acting is appropriate, and I expected to love it, but the songs were a letdown. Either they went on interminably (""Your Song""), or they are truncated to just a few seconds (""Lady Marmalade"") or they are just dull (too many to mention). This is no ""Grease."" Maybe the soundtrack CD is better, but as a musical, it just wasn't catchy. Still, at least it makes an effort to do something artistic, unlike a lot of the crap in theaters."
2,Moulin Rouge Review,"The editing is fast-paced and that's not a good thing. Maybe in a music video,it would work but not here. The writing is terrible at best. 99.9% of the story makes little-to-no sense. Even WCW during it's dying years made more sense then this film. Half of the cast is either dumb or unlikable. It uses copyrighted songs and tries to make them thier own with little success. 99.9% of the acting is very over-the-top to the 5th power. The goodsides are that the settings are stylish,songs are pretty good and the dance numbers are fun to watch. I give this film a 3 out of 10."
4,more than i expected,"wow!!except one little thing, everything about this movie was perfect!even though Ewan was playng gay type of guy, he broke my heart."
4,Brought life back to the genre,"I seldom buy a DVD, as there aren't many movies I could sit down to watch more than once, but this movie is a buy. And this is from a guy who likes action movies.I have two critiques: one, the casting. Kidman doesn't have that face you can feel sympathy for. And Ewan? Well, they should've left him back in one of those Jedi movies. Second, the producer has to get over his Madonna fixation: there were too many Madonna songs, and some of them just didn't fit.Fortunately, the rest of the movie surpasses. Choreography was top notch; and if you ever wondered what Burl Ives would look like singing ""Like a Virgin,"" then you've come to the right place.If you enjoyed the classic Jose Ferrer version, you'll enjoy this one too."
4,Awesome DVD,"After Romeo and Juliet, I was not a big fan of director Baz Luhrmann. However, was always an avid fan of Nicole Kidman. And on Ewan McGregor, I was an agnostic. Now after watching the Moulin Rouge DVD, I am a believer of all three.I won't say that this movie is for everyone. But anyone who likes the theater and opera is sure to like this movie. Excellent scenary (although not real). Excellent tunes. Nicole sings almost as well as she looks! McGregor sings much better than he looks. If you saw the movie, you know what I'm talking about. But the DVD is worth the purchase. Extra clips, footage, documentaries, and ""stuffs"" to keep you busy for days.Come what may? Own this DVD and you won't be disappointed."
2,What Happened?,I'm very unhappy with this movie. It had a lot of potential but listening to classic songs re-done poorly and jumbled together was absolutely painful. The singing and acting were fine - not stellar but fine. I am more disappointed in the fact that I had to hear many of my favorite songs from the 70's and 80's completely butchered. What happened to the days when musicals had original music and lyrics?
3,Sound and Fury Signifying Nothing.,"You have to admire the lavishness of this production, but the stars never get the chance to shine in this overbloated spectacle. Luhrmann squandered a great cast in favor of an awesome display of pyrotechnics. The dialog has been sliced and diced, and the deliveries are little more than sound and fury, as Kidman, McGregor, Broadbent, and Leguizamo strut from one lavish scene to another with no where to go. God only knows what Luhrmann had in mind, but it has been a downward spiral since ""Strictly Ballroom,"" by for the most satisfying feature of his ""Red Curtain Trilogy."" Now Luhrman has the audacity to take on ""La Boheme."" Enough Baz! Get back to the basics. All movies need a good story. You left this one chopped up on the dressing room floor."
1,"Yikes, just yikes! A movie way out of it's time.","Ummm.... I watched this movie at work one day because we had to preview it for our surround sound display and my boss and we were at a loss. We had trouble following the storyline because we're not used to watching musicals. But overall I turned it off and threw it in the trash because it was soo aweful. The only way I can describe it as an ""artsy ditsy touchy-feely"" movie which is one of those movies where you have to be so-called artistic to understand the basic concept of it.All in all: Guys, don't get this one. It's one of those chick flicks that us guys are forced to watch with our girlfriends."
1,Something smells,"To say that this movie is terrible is to be an insult to all things terrible. Once again Hollywood shows that they will put ANYTHING on film. Kidman is beautiful as always but we already know this. But using modern musical tunes as the dialog is tiresome. It would have been a better sell if they had set the movie in current times. But the people who did this piece of crap decided to set it in 19th century France. This just does not work it come off as silly. Steer clear of this movie if you have an IQ of over 40. But if not rent it and be entertained, sort of. But above all dont buy it you will be sorry."
5,The absolute BEST!!,"This is an amazing film, one of the best that I have seen. Not only is it captivating, it has great musical and dance numbers. It teaches an important lesson that it is better to love and to lose than never have loved at all. It's pretty much a love it or hate it movie and I am proud to say that I love it, love it, love it!"
1,Worst dog ever...,"Beautiful costumes. So what! Stolen music. Never mind that, they probably wanted to save money or didn't want to hire a good composer. Beautiful dance sequences destroyed by poor camera work. When skillful dancers are doing their thing I don't want to see ceseless closeups of heads or feet. I want good lighting, and love to see the whole figure, not a palette of color from 50 feet up in the air. (As an example of good camera work for dace sequences, ""Center Stage"" comes to mind). For the first 42 minutes of ""Moulin Rouge,"" the camera never pauses more than 5 seconds on anything. When it does, it's such a relief you feel like crying, but you can't because you already have a terrible head ache. Oh, the plot is nice, but that's too little too late. This dog will go to the pound in a short time. It's an atrocity done with a lot of promotion. They wanted to buy an Oscar. Fortunatelly they didn't, but a lot of people was fooled by the hype, including myself."
2,Campy but not in a good way.,"Moulin Rouge starring Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor is a doomed love story set to classic pop songs. I really wanted to like this colorful musical but I think this film would have been better if the songs were set to an original score, hearing songs I heard a thousand times made watching this film seem silly and pretenious. I don't think Kidman deserved to be nominated for an Oscar, that same year she was absolutely brilliant in The Others so I don't know what all the fuss was about? She's not good here, her singing is ok - nothing spectacular. The Like A Virgin performance is kinda cute but otherwise Moulin Rouge is just average."
1,An insult to art and intelligence,"This movie is a travesty. I am sure those who liked it were either stoned or bribed. I think to really appreciate this movie you need to have 75% of of your brain removed. It is camp, cliched and unimaginative. I will never watch a movie by Baz Luhrmann again."
1,Makes Battlefield Earth look like Oscar material.,"Like Titanic, this was a movie that I intented to enter my grave having never seen. Unfortunately I ended up watching it.That's two hours of my life I want back.This movie is the most disjointed piece of trash I have ever seen. The cinematography alone is enough to make me hate it, but add to that the plot that seemed to have been created while the writer was on some sort of illegal substance[...].P>I'll admit that the costumes and sets were great. Fine.But everything else was so bad that it made up for it. I can't see how anyone likes this movie, or how anyone would be proud to have been in it. I just kept expecting that it would get better, but it never did."
1,Macabre,"What are the folks out in tinsel land thinking? Moulin Rouge was awful--yes, just awful, not even worthy of the one star I have given it. Yes, it may be an extravaganza, but what does this word really mean? Is it meant to portray this garish concoction of fin-du-ciecle cabaret pierced with groteseque 21st century sexuality and voiced with the modern songs of Elton John etc. ? The skewed camera angles peeking up the voluminous skirts revealing fish-netted thunder-thighs (Ugh) gave me the frantic, queasy feeling that I was participating in a stale rendition of a neverending Mardi Gras gone awry after four or five days guzzling of cheap beer.The star goes to poor Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor--I have to wonder why people of this acting caliber would ever want to be in such a film unless it was done solely for charity.Relieved that I did not see this one on the big screen as there would have been absolutely no escape other than leaving the theatre before the film's end."
1,Simply Awful!,"A melange of paper-thin plot, garish turn-of-the-century costumes and contemporary music (melange is, of course, the French word for ""hopeless mess presented artistically""). The Hollywood hype machine seems desperate to laud this drivel until Niclole Kidman receives an Oscar (perhaps part of her divorce settlement with Tom Cuise, or perhaps just public sympathy run amok) but don't you be fooled. If you feel absolutely compelled to waste two hours of your life, try David Lynch's equally stylish but incomprehensible two-hour Twin Peaks finale instead. It also has midgets and velvet drapes, but at least the midgets talk backwards and no one sings ""The Sound of Music."" Or drink a bottle of absinthe instead."
2,Seizure-inducing frenzy!,"Roger Ebert said it was like ""being trapped in an elevator with the circus."" One guy I know likened it to ""an explosion at the peacock factory."" And I agree with both. The film is a choppy, in-your-face blur of musical numbers that should send epileptics everywhere running. And if you take away all the hoopla of the music and the colors, you are left with a disappointingly ordinary plot. I do admire the balls Baz Luhrmann had when he decided to use songs such as ""Like a Virgin"" in such a bizarre way, but I still wouldn't recommend this film to anyone."
1,Excederin Headache #2031,"I have to respect that a number of people whose taste I trust loved this, but, my God did it give me a headache. It was similar to being subjected to a strobe light for 2 hours. Was this a musical for the attention span deficiant, or an attempt to recreate a 19th century acid flashback? I guess that my zero tolerence for the ""art form"" of the musical may have pre-disposed me to loathing this. Nonetheless, ugh."
1,Get off the drugs!,"This has got to be the worst movie I have ever seen. From the opening scene to the point of ""Like a Virgin"", where I walked out, the movie is a total waste. Unfortunatley I did follow the majority of the crowd who walked during the first 15 minutes of the film. Nicole and the entire cast and crew should lay off the drugs and get back to earth. Unfortunately Nicole's character did not die soon enough and spare the audience the pain of this horrible screeching and howling."
1,"Tragic, Gut wrenching, Funny...","I mean that the acting and plot are tragically bad and the singing evokes a gag response that will make you wish you hadn't eaten the fish for dinner.It is hilarious that THIS movie was so popular. This movie is positive proof that the ONLY things important in selling movies to people nowadays are a couple of well-knowns, a large budget, and a seedy reputation.Personally, I'd take great writing and raw talent over big names and hype any day."
4,Love it or hate it...,"Some people dislike this movie because they don't understand it, and some just flat out don't like it. To each their own.You have to admit that the beginning of this movie is like being high, or something--a guy falls through the ceiling, everything is kind of dizzyingly bright and everybody is a little bit on the psychotic side, if I remember correctly. But I have a tendency to be amused by these kinds of things, and besides, it was interesting. After awhile this movie gets a bit darker, and it's still somewhat chaotic in nature until the end, but I found it highly entertaining."
4,"A Romance, Comedy, Drama, Musical","First off I hate Musicals, anything that has music in it I hate it. This movie however I liked a lot. I do not know what it was about this movie but it was good. I thought that it was one hell of a performance. I have seen the Moulin Rouge show in Paris and thought it was fantastic, and at first I did not want to see the movie because I thought it would ruin the show, but it only bettered it. Should have won the Oscar for Best Picture Recommended to anyone who loves to have fun while watching a movie."
1,Not a movie. Just a big budget blown on confusing bunk,"Don't listen to the people who praise this movie. They obviously want you to think they are understanding something about it that you don't. There's nothing to understand except a big budget was wasted on a confusing, incoherent, and very maddening collection of scenes. It's like taking five or six pails of different colored paint, throwing them against a wall and trying to pass it off as ""art"". There will always be a bunch of sheep who claim the result is a ""masterpiece"", ""genius"". Please! I'm surprised my DVD player didn't just automatically eject it after an hour in a gagging, convulsive fit of disgust. If I had watched this in a theatre, I would have demanded my money back."
1,what a piece of junk....,"So far this goes down as my worst DVD purchase of all time. It's a mishmash of bad 70's music performed terribly. The story line, if you can call it that, is terrible. Its got bad acting to boot. Blech! you'll find my copy for sale on Ebay."
1,BAD MOVIE,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Just a lot of noise and confusion ... no acting..... no story ... no plot. It stinks, period. Now, if you find someone who tells you they like this movie, you should reevaluate your friends taste. This movie was absolutely a waste of film."
1,Ugh!,"Well, I guess I didn't ""get it,"" since that's how everyone who loves this stinking movie explains away those of us who don't. Couldn't have anything to do with the ridiculous performances (who else wanted to see John Leguizamo take a long walk off a short pier, and who else but me felt embarrassed for poor Jim Broadbent, terrific in so many other things), Baz Luhrmann's irritating directorial style (his target audience would appear to be 14-year old girls with ADS), or the banal music (""Hedwig and the Angry Inch,"" a REAL muscical, made fun of ""I Will Always Love You."" ""Moulin Rouge"" pays homage to it). This film is vapid eye candy stretched out over an exhausting 2 hours. Congrats, Baz---you've succeeded in inventing a new genre---the feature-length MTV video. And for those of you who think we've all missed the point----Baz ain't exactly Ingmar Bergman."
5,Excellent!,"Moulin Rouge! is the best movie I've seen in a long time. It is a unique, colorful, and overall fun film. The acting is great, the story is a bit cliched but what it lacks the unique and beautiful touches make up for, the songs are FABULOUS, the main reason to see the film, and the scenery and atmosphere of the movie are great. I must warn, though, if you don't like musicals, this movie is not for you."
5,Best Movie,"It was soooo great! It was so much to look at and very entertaining. I loved all the people in it and don't know why it did so badly. People are closed minded, I guess."
5,Don't Miss This Movie !,I thought Moulin Rouge was aswosome because it was a love story and how Christian became invole with the Moulin Rouge. I like the storyline and how it was like back flash. I didn't like when the Duke wanted Satine for him self. I like the costumes in the movie because they just so awesome. The music I thought went really well with it because it was part of the movie. I hope that other people will see it and I hope this help to give you idea of what the movie is about.
5,moulim rouge,I think the movie is wonderful nicole got me actually realize that I do have a soul let even after my tragic loss of my fience who was killed a year ago this past april. I was holding all of that anger and hurt and frustration from his motorcycle accident I used to just beat myself up inside and i just thought I should just except the fact that it was his time to go I guess. This movie was an awsome movie and If I could shake nicole kidman hand I would let her know that I could see that she was showing alot of her love for tom was put into this movie and nicole don't give up on tom you two remind me alot of me and my fience and I wish you the best keep your head up. If give nicole an emmy I would she gets a 10 in my book.
4,Loved it.,"If you like Musicals, you will love this movie. It has love and a lot of sense of humor.You'll either love this movie or hate."
1,"The Horror, The Horror","Oh..my...[word]..They blaspheme! Elton John's 'Your Song' smudged in the dirt. Bowie's 'Heroes' ground into dust. Nirvana mixed with 'Lady Marmalade', Marilyn Monroe mixed with Madonna,,,...Marq"
4,Are you an Elton John fan?,"""It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside..."" If you are an Elton John fan and you like relatively mainstream rock music and your taste in movies does not run along the lines of Armageddon or other movies where the main character's are explosions than you will probably love this movie. Many scenes are over the top and a little bizarre - but that just makes it more fun to watch."
4,Beautiful Love Story,"When this movie first came out I did not see it, I bought it on Pay Per View and realized just how beautiful this movie is and that it deserved all the awards it got at the last awards show. If you like musical films, you will either like it or love it. I look forward to seeing this movie again! The music works well in this movie as well!BEAUTIFUL LOVE MOVIE!!!"
5,The Baz Triple,"If you don't already know his previous 2 films - Strictly Ballroom and the modern Romeo and Juliet, you've been missing out. Are you ready for a modern day musical to dazzle you with great style? From the very moment this film opens it takes you on a ride. Imaginatively creative, this film is packed! Vibrantly alive, the audience was interactive, I heard the positive murmurings during the film. The sets are gorgeous (the color, the details), almost all the acting was spot-on -- bravo to Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, the story was intriguing, the musical quality was uniquely done (the musical numbers -- a bridge between old and new), and the directing could have been slowed down a tad at the beginning but is the glue. Not many films like it come around very often. I do think this is the last film about star crossed lovers I can handle for awhile, but this film provides so much it demands you see it more than once."
3,Moulin Rouge DVD review,"It was Dirty, finger printed, and unidentified mystery gunk.....other than that everything else was cleaned....but the cd. it came in one piece and in nice condition but the disk being dirty wasn't too appealing."
2,merit?,Spent forty wasted minutes watching much ado about nothing. Utterly tasteless. Actually not surprised; previews had always dicouraged my viewing.
1,Go watch Chicago instead,"It was very difficult fir me to actually watch this movie the entire way through. I saw this and ahted it, but when Chicago came out i thought it was one of the best musicals of the time. Here the acting was fairly weak and the plot was just boring. If you want to see a musical, go get Chicago, not this trash."
1,Just plain Bad,"I'm a fan of Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly - and nothing in this video approaches the singing and dancing of these two legends. The characters were cardboard, the overuse of computer graphics was nauseating, the songs were just plain terrible - no reason to celebrate most modern pop, and I ended up feeling just drained after watching even 30 minutes of this calamity.I wouldn't force this movie on my worst enemy. I suggest that you pick up 'Singing in the Rain' if you want to see a musical with heart, dancing, and good singing."
1,Both My Thumbs Down On This One,As a child of the 50's and 60's I grew up with Hollywood musicals and love them still. I was happy to see that perhaps the musical was coming back. If they are like this one - they can stay away. I was ready to run outside screaming after watching only half the first disc. WHAT A MESS!!
1,A Really DULL Film,"This movie obviously thinks it is doing something 'new' and 'special', and evidently it has managed to deceive many people. The trouble is, the film is entirely lacking in heart. The plot is thin and predictable, the characters are cliches, the dialogue is appaling. Even the editing and the direction appear heavy-handed. Every sequence goes on too long. Lengthy parts of the film are actually REPEATED later on, and sometimes more than once. As if they weren't dull enough the first time round, we have to see them again!If you want to see a real work of art which revitalises the musical genre, check out 'Everyone says I love you'."
5,how do I love thee?,got this for my daughter and we watched it together again as we have a few times before but she wanted her own dvd of moulin rouge. ordering was easy and receipt of dvd was reasonable length of time. very satisfied!
3,Great seller!,This got shipped really quickly and included everything that was described in the description. The disc does however freeze for a bit during the film and skips about a minute or two of the movie.
4,Visually Great,"Baz Luhrmann is obviously a very talented visual director. This movie is eye-candy deluxe. The songs, and singing are good throughout. The script was a little weak for me, but I still enjoy watching it repeatedly because of the spectacle of it all. I look forward to his next film. It was worth the blu-ray upgrade."
5,The best movie ever,This is my absolute favorite movie. It's full of color and music. I'm a big fan of Nicole Kidman and that was the reason I saw this movie. Her singing was amazing and so was Ewan McGregor's. This is a must-see film if you're into musicals and romance. I can't wait to own it on video and watch it over and over again.
4,Glamorous Visual Diarrhoea,"After almost 1700 customer reviews I'll just say this - only buy this DVD if you really, truly loved the movie. I liked it plenty, but having purchased the double digipack edition, I've never actually watched the film again - just the extras (which, by the way, are the absolute best in terms of content, variety and quality that I've ever seen on a DVD).MR is a phsychidelic, visual, loud, brash and fun love-tragicomedy, and worth buying for the Extras DVD alone. For lovers of the story, the disc with the movie on it is a nice little add-on :-) For those of us who weren't as blown away by the actual plot, rent it first..."
4,Nicole Kidman Proves to be outstanding-Ben N. at the movies,"Wow this movie was good Nicole Kidman was spectacualr in her own dazzling way she made the film 100 times better with drama and love intrest with Ewan Mcgregor a good actor that stands his ground by the way this is a musical film so if you exoect something else then dont because this is something to love not hate Moulin Rouge is a 4-star masterpiece good, good, and more good"
5,all you need is <this DVD> love...,"Moulin Rouge, in my humble opinion one of the best musicals ever, is even cooler on DVD. Probably because its better quality (no kidding).If you haven't seen the movie, here's a brief summary:Moulin Rouge is a musical that tells the story of Christian, a writer, who moves to Paris {Montmarte} in 1900...and ends up writing a play for the Moulin Rouge...and falling in love with the nightclub's star act, Satine. Filled with awesome renditions of reworked songs from the Beatles, Elton John and more...laughter and sadness (I cried the first 3 times I watched it)... and of course an evil villian, ""The Duke"", who stands in the way of Christian and Satine's love.If I could give this ten stars, I would give it ten. This goofy, unique, romantic, melodic, comedic, dramatic movie definitely deserves it."
4,A pleasant surprise,"This is another movie that I was dragged to by my girl friend, and I was pleasantly surprised. Personally, I thought the movie was great. I loved the way they blended several different songs into one song; I thought it was very creative how they did that. I had a lot of fun watching this movie, though it may not be for everyone."
5,It knocked my socks off!!!,"What a movie...I was not expecting anything and pow! Within 5 minutes, after the shock of its originality wore off, I loved every second of it. A totally new way of looking at a musical. Madonna can only wish her movies came off this well.It's like watching your favourite music video continue on for a couple of hours! It moved at a breathtaking pace. I was never bored.I really wanted Nicol to win the Oscar. (I also think Sissy Spacek would have been a worthy cadidate for In The Bedroom).Kudos to the production, directions, costumes, and music. Hey, this is the first time in almost 50 years a challenger to the great Marilyn Monroe rendition of Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend has appeared! That alone is worth the price of this rental!! Enjoy..."
5,Awesome!,"I loved this film, and I hate musicals. I usually find musicals to be very heavy handed, sappy, and pointless. But Moulin Rouge greatly contradicted my previous experiences. It was fast paced, beautiful, emotional, and above all, the music was great. Moulin Rouge had music from many genres, and time periods. This helped keep the `anti-musical' viewer, like myself, entertained. Music aside, the excellent acting in the film told a great story. I am usually not a big fan of Ewan McGregor, John Leguizamo, or even Nicole Kidman. But once again my earlier impressions misled me. They all did very well. In fact, there were no characters in Moulin Rouge that gave less than ideal performances. If you want a film that is truly creative, and exciting, then by all means, get Moulin Rouge."
5,You've Gotta See This Movie!!!!!!!,"all i have to say is SEE THIS MOVIE!!!! this is the best movie in the world!!! i cant wait until it comes out!!!! i am gonna buy it the second it comes out!! i definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes romance,comedy,drama....... anything!!!! this movie's got it all!!!!!!!"
5,Moulin Rouge the greatest movie of my time (so far),This is a review of Moulin Rouge. I think this is a great movie I especially liked the club and the sets. The story line is easy to follow and really captures the theatre. The songs are really amazing and the cast are just perfect. I enjoy all of the scenes and even enjoy the sad parts (I wont tell you what they are you have to watch it for yourself) at the moment i am searching for all of the CDs and posters i hope you anjoy the film as much aqs i didEmily
3,One of the Best Music Videos Ever!,"You can't really call it a Movie, but a heck of a video for sure. Nicole Kidman was certainly not the best actress this year (as we saw), and you really wanted to slap Ewan McGregor's character by the end. Jim Broadbent was the true highlight."
2,Overhyped and overrated,"Baz Luhrmann deserves credit for his bravado, but he scores zero points for making a chaotic, excessive, in-your-face movie which is essentially one big mess. The movie is frantic and jittery in its pacing and is filled with self-indulgent rapid-fire camera movements and editing which does NOT ENHANCE the story in anyway. Rather it DETRACTS from it.It gives the viewer a throbbing headache rather than touching one's heart or stimulating the viewer's intellect.Nicole Kidman is lovely and she has a beautiful singing voice. But Ewan McGregor, handsome as he is, has a loud, colorless voice which lacks any nuance or subtletly.On the plus side, the sets and costumes are quite spectacular, but the movie as a whole is trying too hard to ""redefine"" the musical so that ""Moulin Rouge"" loses coherence or poignancy. Sometimes less is more."
3,Um...so-so,"'Moulin Rouge' started out light-hearted and funny. Like the play up stairs from Christians bedroom to the ""Spectacular, Spectacular!"" song. But then after that it turned into another chick flick, all mushed up with love. So my advice to you is to see it if you want to laugh and then get borded."
5,Best musical: Moulin Rouge,I think this movie its just the best musical I've ever seen. It's ammazing. I really recommend it
2,"Over stimulating, frenetic pace...you get the idea","This was just an awful experience. The dialogue was puerile, the music ordinary and the acting over done. You either love this or hate it. It's nice from a technical standpoint but, for someone who likes a fresh story line, this is not interesting. The actors did what they could, frenetically, but the techniques are bigger than they are; in any movie other than Star Wars, that's bad news!"
1,Worst Film of The Year,"It is rare that I walk out of a movie, or worse, stop a movie on DVD before its completion. I was ready to chuck this movie out the window after about 10 minutes into it. It came across like a really bad SNL skit and just got more annoying as time wore on. After 20 minutes, I threw in the towel.Yikes! What the hell was this piece of ... anyway? The weekly countdown of old pop tunes?The story was incomprehensible, even if I could stand the ridiculous musical score.Whatever it was, I would not recommend it to my worst enemy."
4,AWESOME,i LOVE moulin rouge. its my favorite movie!!! the widescreen kind of sucks but it's totally worth it to see this movie whenever i want!
1,By far the worst movie,I went to the opening of this movie years ago.It's the only movie I have seen where I want to leave the cinema.The music is poor the acting is even worse.Don't get this DVD
1,TERRIBLE!,"This is not a movie! It's a musical! Guy or girl, This movie is TERRIBLE! I had to force myself to finish it! Doesn't get ANY WORSE then this!"
1,THIS was nominated for BEST PICTURE???,"I can't even begin to fathom what the members of the Academy were thinking. This is probably the second worst film ever produced (the first being that waste of celluloid ""Showgirls""). I enjoyed the performances, particularaly Kidman's, but that does NOT a good film make. Disjointed, poorly written, extremely poorly edited. I can't say enough bad about this film."
4,"""La Traviata"" on Acid","The storyline of this ""Moulin Rouge"" borrows heavily from ""La Traviata,"" which in turn was based on ""La Dame aux Camelias"" -- a tragic love story about a tuberculosis-stricken courtesan who ... well, if you haven't seen the movie, I won't spoil it for you. And in any case, the storyline is there just to hang eye-popping, extravagant musical numbers on. None of it is very believable, but it's fun in a trippy, overblown way. The 1960s-80s music works surprisingly well with the stylized 1900-era setting (""Paris as imagined by Tim Burton,"" in one reviewer's words) and the performances are entertaining. Ewan MacGregor is a bit too low-key -- I would have loved to see Jim Carrey in the role of Christian -- but otherwise the cast carries out their assignments quite well. I'll give this a low 4 stars."
5,Totally was not what I expected,"I am so happy that I watched this movie, when it first came out I never wanted to go see it because it just looked boring. But recently I went to rent the video and found out that that was the biggest mistake I had made. It's fantastic! I had never really been a fan of Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgregor, but this movie totally just changed my view towards them both.Now I am a total Ewan fan and am really happy to discover this. I find him totally suitable for his character, very charming in doing his part and I love his voice, there are not many actors out there that can act well, AND sing well, but there's Ewan. The story although is not original and the songs also but It blended together perfectly, Your Song, Come What May are my personal favorites, I'm always rewinding back just to listen to the songs and now I got them both on computer! I would totally recommand this film to those who have not seen it."
5,WOW!!!!,"I just got back from seeing ""Moulin Rouge"". This has got to be the best movie I have seen in a very long time. When I first saw the previews, I really did not want to go see it, but my girlfriend did. Being the good boyfriend that I am, I took her to see it expecting to get a 2 hour nap out of it. After the movie started, I barely blinked. The special effects and the acting were great, but what really sold the movie to me was the music. Never have I expected 80-90's music blending together to form beautiful music. After seeing it, I ran out and bought the CD. I have already listed to it 5 times, and I have only been home 30 min. Please go see it. A movie like this only comes around once in a blue moon. I am already making plans to go see it again."
5,omg,this was such an awesome movie.......intensely deep and you could totally get into it. I LOVE MOULIN ROUGE AND EWAN MCGREGORS VOICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Simply The Best !!!!!,"Stunning sets,flashy and dazzling costumes,and the best performances make this movie a winner.The chemisrty between Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor is electrifying,when they sing you feel the magic.The songs and dances are performed spectacularly and the movie is a hit."
5,The Fave,"The movie itself is definatly the most incredible movie I have ever seen. It has everything that a movie goer would want from it. The DVD comes packed with so many great features. Deleted Scenes, extended dance sequences, music videos make for an incredible DVD experience to go along with the incredible movie experience."
4,Moulin Rouge,"I gave this film 4 stars minus one star for its flaw of not finishing most of the songs in the film. Otherwise, this is a great film. I loved it, the visual effects were great, the story, and the music, was all spectacular. Nicole Kidman was abosolutely beautiful and her voice very similar to Helen Reddy. I think Ewan McGregar was great as well, didn't know he could sing either.However, my husband thought it was the dumbest movie ever. I'd say rent it first, and if you like then buy it.Unfortunately it is only available on DVD. They did the same thing with A Knights Tale (another great film). Hollywood dosen't seem to realize not all of us are rich enough to own a DVD player yet.Thanks."
5,Come What May - See This Film,"As the movie starts you just don't know, ""can I sit through two hours of this"". You decide to give it a chance and after it's all over you say to yourself, "" WOW, Spectacular, Spectacular - that's a movie I could watch again"". Kidman and McGregor make beautiful music together. Drama, Suspense, Horror, Comedy, a little bit of everything, but most of all a love story. Destined to be a classic. Watch it again!"
