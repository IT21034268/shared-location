2,"Can You Say: The Worst...Like, Acting? ...On Any...'Reality ' Show?...Like, Anyplace?","The Hills The Complete Second Season is total and complete offal (c'mon, look up the definition, I dare ya). How did I ever used to like this show? Terrible. Awful. Sharks long since jumped. This DVD set is awash with vainglorious extras that make the stomach churn. Anyone want my boxed set? For free? Please?"
1,Very disappointing,I bought this item on the basis of music from a band that I love which was used on the soundtrack of the version broadcast on US TV. Imagine my disappointment when the soundtrack of this dvd version turned out to be completely different. A complete waste of 20. Pah!
1,Beautifully boring.,"I don't care what people say, The Hills is totally scripted! I cannot watch five minutes of this ""reality"" show without getting a headache. Lauren, Heidi, Audrina, and Whitney are the biggest complainers ever! The cameras used on this show are quite glossy and eye-catching and so is the editing but the pace and the garbage these spoiled girls gossip about is so boring. How could MTV put a show that is so pointless, I'll take The Real World over this junk any day."
3,Don't think I'll stay on season 3...,"The subjects are becoming way too girly for me and too much songs were changed on this set.As I know pretty much all the songs were changed on Season 3 set and that season 2 started to disappoint me with it shallowness,I think my journey on the hills is over with this one.A season to watch though and some situations you can relate to (I know I did...),but it's like every reality show,you get easily hooked on it with the first eps and then you get tired of it,just like that..."
5,girlfriends LOVE The Hills!!!!,"If ur girlfriend is into The Hills tv show, u cant go wrong buying here the complete seasons on dvd! Days of their time is filled with joy as we can go do the things WE enjoy! : D haha"
5,finally some answers,"I didn't start watching the Hills until season 3 , I really wanted to know why Lauren hated Spencer so much, & what caused the big riff between Lauren & Heidi. Thankfully season 2 answered all my questions & in my opinion is a great dvd series to watch & to own. Season 1 is also well worth watching."
4,The 20 Minute Experience,"I think that this is one of UKJ's best Cds. Although there are only a few tracks, and the cd is rather short, I feel that this CD still rocks hard. If you are into good hard rock, then this cd is for you. Songs like 'madman' and 'whiplash liquor' show the listener that rock is one of the greatest types of music we have."
3,"Hardly ugly, but hinting at the fun to come","An EP that would of been totally forgotten had Everything About You not been a worldwide hard rock hit. So what do we get? Well the hit, obviously, plus Madman which was remixed for the debut full length release and then fou other tracks of varying quality.Whiplash is a track where Whitfield Crane uses most of his vocal tricks and the song rides a funk rock groove which is totally appropriate for this type of rock. Too Bad is a fairly lacklustre toon and the EP's rounded off w/Sweet Leaf and an upbeat semi jam sort of track, like the band only just had enough material to fill this EP. Oh and the mystery track at the end - mmm 15 seconds of joke tune.All this is topped off with a low rent band pic and a few suitably juvenile drawings involving the bands cartoon mascot. Not an essential release in anybodys universe. But it has a couple of fun tracks and fans of the band do need this in their collection."
5,The best Quick has written,I have read many of Quick's novel's but this one stands out. Not only is there a story of romance going on but there is also a real plot to it. The heroess is somewhat unrealistic but thats what makes her exiting. This is a wonderful novel that I encourage everyone to read.
4,"The book is fine, the hero is not!","As always,I enjoy reading ANY Quick book, but I can not stand the hero! He lies and deceives the heroine and only wants her for her money! Sure, he comes around at the end and falls in love with her, but what way is that to start a relationship? Other than that, it's great!"
3,Some problems with this book,"A man who would enable a woman to do what society says she mustn't is interesting. Having the same man then demand she behave according to his more conservative standards as his wife is WEIRD! I didn't like his determined fortune-hunting, either. Still, there were good moments. A near-miss book."
1,Ugh,"My brief notes for this simply say ""Alpha male ********. This is why I don't think I'll marry."" Granted, I can be prone to exaggeration, but this book is not at all an example of a remotely healthy relationship. Penniless earl decides to marry unconventional heiress. He knows she's concerned about fortune hunters so he lies and schemes and promises her the adventure she craves, and then once they're married to avoid her ruination by scandal, he promptly strips her of her independence, intellectual pursuits, and personal fashion choices. At some point among all this repressing, they solve a mystery. Woohoo. Not at all Quick's best."
2,Not up to par,"I was so disappointed in this story. Liked the heroine but never warmed up to the hero. She was strong, intelligent, and unconventional. I expected a hero who was her equal. Unfortunately, that was not to be. I never could get past the fact that Lucas admitted he loved Lady Atherton enough to propose marriage but didn't love Vicky until he experienced her passion at the inn. Even then he was a real tyrant and a bully. I could have overlooked the Lady Atherton infatuation if it had been made in the ignorance of youth, but he was 30 years old. Yuck. Lucas never measured up and I don't know what Vicky saw in him. Maybe we can hope for a sequel in which the widowed Vicky finds a man that is her equal - maybe someone like a Tobias March!!!!!"
2,FLOWED IN WAVES OF BOREDOM---,"This story drug on through the first half, rehashing the same info over and over, then picked up the pace and became interesting only to fizzle out once again. It didn't help that the villain was so anticlimactic and the reasons behind the misdeeds so lame. The worst part was the hero/heroine were quite delightful and the very few ""adventures"" were quite fun. This could have been an enjoyable story."
1,AVID FAN,"AM PUTTING IN AN ORDER FOR TWO OF MY OLD FAVORITES OF A. QUICK -- RAVISHED AND MISTRESS. SURRENDER WAS ONE OF THE FEW A. QUICK NOVELS THAT I HATED!!! IN FACT, I HATED IT SO MUCH THAT I THREW MY COPY AWAY. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. LOUSY TYRANT, LIAR, AND OVERALL LOUSE OF A HERO. GOT TOO MANY OF THOSE IN REAL LIFE. I SURE DON'T NEED TO PAY TO READ ABOUT THEM AS AN ESCAPE. JAK & A. QUICK HAVE DONE MUCH, MUCH, MUCH BETTER."
1,Disappointing,"I've never met a character I despised as much as Lucas. While it may reflect the way of life back in the day where a man controlled the money and dictated a woman's comings and goings, my more modern sensibilities found nothing romantic about the manipulation of Vicky. What a way to crush the spirit of a genuinely interesting romantic heroine. Hope I'm not giving away the plot ending by saying, It's a shame he didn't befall a tragic ending."
2,Hero is not,"Lucas is clearly a man who uses Victoria for his own means and strings her along with adventure until she is tricked into marrying him. Once she does, he friendly facade fades and she is left with an overbearing ""lord"" who lords his power over her. What makes her still love him? I certainly don't know."
2,Super Winch EP9000,"Comes with a snatch block and remote, which is better than the original SW remote, which is like the warn winch remote.My old SW 9000 had smaller cable, but this cable was too damaged after using it 4 times. As usual all the anchors I have are off thee side of the trail; trees. It is now all kinked and the wire splitting. the other negative is the little plastic cap over the remote plug broke off. another negative is that it is too hard to pull the cable out on free spool. I have done allot of winching so I know what I am saying here. it also did not match up to my winch plate so I had to drill new wholes for it.I do not recommend this winch"
2,disappointed,"After a few weeks this faucet began to leak, actually spurt, from the center where the faucet attaches to the body of the assembly. Tightening only temporarily solved the problem. Then the hot water handle loosened and I don't know how to tighten it. I looked at the return policy of Bob's Faucets and found that in order to return this defective product, it had to be done within fourteen days, in its originally, uninstalled condition and then only for exchange or replacement with a 20% fee or some kind. The only reason I gave this product two stars is because it was delivered promptly, is very attractive and would have made a great addition to my old sink. If it worked properly."
5,Haunting.,"This is my very favorite movie. It has a complex and moving story line. The child is enchanting. So much symbolism, rich character development and beautiful photography depicting the tragedy of people caught up in events bigger than themselves which brings them all down, even the innocents. Hauntingly beautiful."
3,"Good, but lacking","Without question this film features fine acting. But there is something lacking in the plot--it develops too slowly, is at times too confusing, and ends too suddenly. I enjoyed the film as far as the acting, but the plot left me dry, and frankly, after about an hour I stopped caring what happened in the end. Russia has produced better films."
4,one of the saddest movies I've ever seen,"Burnt by the Sun is one of those movies that you're glad you saw because it was powerful but you never want to see again because it was so sad.The movie takes place in the last happy days of a family's lives. The father is a hero of the Soviet revolution and not only does he spout the party line, he actually believes it. His wife and her family don't care much for Stalin but their sensible enought to never say so out loud. Then, like a snake in the garden a visitor arrives. He brings death and prison with him and by the time the movie is over no-one in this family will be left unscathed. This is a nice little family and Stalin will crush them. That's the movie. The stand outs are the child actress who played the spunky, adorable daughter and the actor who played her old father, the general."
2,40 minutes was enough for me,"In all fairness I can't review the whole film, since I walked of it--it was pretty annoying. I can't imagine how it could have won any awards; the acting was shallow grimacing."
2,it left me rooting for stalin,"a tired bit of revisionist propaganda out of post-soviet russia which somehow won an oscar as best foreign film. its fascinating that something so heavy handed can pretend to be an answer to the vile excesses of the stalin era, but what can one expect? there is (at least one) great movie to be made about that era; dont look for it here."
5,This book rocks my husband wrote it for me,"hi my namee is sun byun my husband wrote this book for me because I burnt him with a hot frying pan (hence the name, burnt by the sun) It is a wonderful book"
5,I understand how difficult it is to understand...,"It is SO funny to read these reviews sometimes... But I can get it. We have so much in different between our nations that I don't even wanna talk about it right now. I'll be happy to answer to all of your questions you might have about this movie. I bet you understood how deep this movie is. It does have more questions than answers especially when you watch it less than 3 times. Of course I don't even talk about people who wanted to press 'fwd' button. These guys will never get Russian culture at all. But people are people. For me - this is the best russian movie ever, it has outstanding plays and very, very deep..."
5,Most enjoyable....,Enjoyed seeing this film for the third time since it was released.Nice film for your collection.
4,a great movie,"saw this when it came out, got it as a present for my friend the playwright who also saw it but who was delighted to own it & be able to see it again.definitely worth it, touching, heartfelt."
4,A viewer,"I saw bits of Burnt by the Sun years ago, but when I saw it fully recently I was impressed. It's a film basically about love and life in the Soviet Union in the 1930's. It might be a bit long for western viewers especially when reading subtitles, but if you give it a chance you will gain some insight into the cult of Stalin leading to the ""purges of '36"". The ending in this film is one that you'll probably never forget."
1,mediocre,"The fild does not reflect history in all its dimensions. I would even say it distorts the truth by presenting a very single-sided point of view. It is definitly popular abroad, as people in the West tend not to know much about Russia and the former Soviet Union. In Russia, however, very few find the director historically honest. The West is also very often scared by the Russian mafia. Perhaps, it would be interesting for many to know that the film's director is one of the Oligarchs' men, a servant of robber barons, who pay him for service with money they steal from the people."
2,WARNING....Do not watch this movie!!!...,"This movie is a disaster, the actors are shallow, the director is awfull and it doesn't deserve an academy award... Milcho Manchevski made a better movie than Nikita Mikhalkov,and he deserved the Oscar!"
1,"Big Bad South Side Califa's 13, L.A.","DON'T WASTE YOUR FERIA ON BULL SH*T GO GET SOME REAL MEXICAN RAP, SOUTH SIDE RAP, TRECE RUNNIN SH*T!!!!!"

4,I am the author--here's the truth,"I wrote this book while canoeing the river several years ago--there were no guides and, of course, nothing at all with GPS locations in it--regarding re-supply points, getting around the dams, contacts in towns for help etc. If you are canoeing part or all of the river you'll want this--it is printed in a handy pocket sized edition. In fact, if you EVER plan to canoe the river--buy it now, it is self-published and when the first print run of 1000 copies is gone it goes out of print--so far 700 copies have sold. Happy canoeing. I had a riot on my trek-- but it has its moments--one time when the rollers on one of those big lakes were as high as my canoe was long! Enjoy! -- Keith Drury Indiana Wesleyan University keith.drury@indwes.edu"
4,Review Guide to Canoeing the Missouri River,"A short, quick read. Enjoyed it. I am planning a canoe trip,as well, however, he had a motor on his canoe, and I won't, sosome information would not be applicable to my situation. Didfind the personal experiences of interest and the informationon the stops he made and the availability of purchasing supplieshelpful."
2,Disappointed,"I know that this was privately published and I'm sure that the author put his heart and soul into the effort, but it just did not meet my expectations, especially considering the price. Perhaps other people will like it more."
5,THE BEST INTERPRETATION,"This piece has never had such a bold, broad, and powerful, yet amazingly sensitive performance. It overwhelmed me the first time I heard it, with it's opening chords. One feels a great amount of power and confidence(though that may not have been how Mr. Janis felt during the performance.) Soon with the sensitive scales perfected with elegance, the listners is amazed at such control of the pianist. Throughout the performance, Mr. Janis embraces the audience with magical sounds, leading us all in a whole new adventure."
3,"A journalist's view of ""The Situation""","Although I find it hard to be as optimistic as the author is, I feel that the mood of this book gives an excellent feel for what's going on here today. The 12 people interviewed in the book are not major players in the conflict between the Jews and the Arabs in Israel, but their views provide insight into what the issues are."
4,medelisohm,want to know about erich mendelisohm's history from the begining of his career and want to review his important works as an architect
1,"C'mon guys, get serious.","This has got to be one of the worst albums ever. There's a reason you can pick it up ""buy one get one free"" in the 99 cent store. The singing and musicianship is mediocre at best, but that still doesn't redeem this worthless drivel. The songs sounded horifically dated when it came out in the mid-nineties. The songwriting is so bad, it's laughable; even the song about the kid who died. It's supposed to be tear-jerking, and normally would be, but the idiot who wrote this song makes the listener laugh out loud.I used to buy this as a gag gift for my friends. Seriously, this is one of the worst albums in the history of album-making. There's not one redeeming factor."
4,One Funny Album....,"There's only one word for this album... Wow.Hulk Hogan is one of my favorite wrestlers of all time. When I heard ""I Wanna Be a Hulkamaniac"" a few years back, I couldn't believe that he did an album. I couldn't find it in any stores (and for good reason) but thanks to the glorious internet, I finally found it. I can't take him seriously anymore. I can't believe that this was made in 1995 just because of the cheese factor. I must say he's got guts to do something like this...The reason I gave it 4 stars was because of the cheese factor. If you're having a miserable day, pop this in your CD player or Ipod, it'll boost your spirits because all you can do is laugh."
1,Pure Garbage,"This cd does not even deserve any stars. Pure Garbage. Hulk Hogan was washed up when this came out, and 13 years later he is still doing anything to keep himself in the limelight. I'd rather hear a toilet flush than this stuff. Do us a favor Hogan, just fade away."
5,Is there anything the Hulkster can't do?,"Anyone who gives this album a ""serious"" review is seriously missing the point. This is, after all, music from the man who played Suburban Commando. We should not judge the Hulkster as if he were but a mere mortal. This CD is so terrible that it's totally AWESOME. I don't know about the rest of you, but when I plunk down cash for a CD, I expect some entertainment. Rest assured that Hulk and the rest of the gang deliver the goods. There is not a dull moment from start to finish, as Hogan rocks out and delivers good advise at the same time. Prayers and vitamins indeed!"
5,OOO LOOK AT THAT NEW VEIN IN MY TRICEP,WHATCHA GONNA DO BRUTHER?? HULKAMANIA FOREVER BRUTHER!!! I BOUGHT THIS TAPE FOR 45 CENTS AND IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE PRICY BUT ITs WORTH IT.SAY YOUR PRAYERS AND EAT YOUR VITAMINS
5,I just simultaneously orgasmed eight times,"Words cannot describe Hulk Hogan and the Wrestling Boot Band's ""Hulk Rules""."
2,Stain does not match the picture,The stain color of the cabinet does not match the picture on the Internet. It is much darker than it appears. Almost more like a chocolate brown. I mean other than that it appears to be OK. I was hoping to have it match the color of the other furniture downstairs.
3,Boring,"This book was at best mediocre. I would not recommend it to anyone who is looking for genuine help with anger. Some sections were decent, but overall I would not purchase this book. There were too many weak sections that sounded like mumbo jumbo."
4,Symphonic Band Memories,"I bought this album primarily for the ""Symphonic Songs for Band"" suite by Robert Russell Bennett and the ""Fanfare and Allegro"" By Clifton Williams. They are the favorite pieces I was privledged to participate in performing while a member of the Cal Poly symphonic ban in the 70's. I also remember performing them in high school. I was not disappointed in purchasing this disc! The performances captured here are excellent! The music sends chills down my spine .... I highly recommend the entire album for anyone interested in the genre of symphonic band music!"
4,phat chance is gone. BRING ON THE ROCK AND ROLL!!,"The Days of Phat Chance are over. Yes, phat chance officially stunk on Ice, plus they were an nsync/backstreet boys wannabe, but that isn't them anymore. Now they're a rocknroll band, and they are awesome. Buy this cd if you like classic rock and roll, AND if you don't. Even though they are a sort of classic rock, they're still very cool otherwise."
1,Break Up,This band used to be called Phat Chance and I can some thi sup right now. Phat Chance you guys will ever be successful
4,Another Naz classic,"The guitar work on this album will grow on you! Who else at this time in the 70s had heavier guitars WITH the loudest and raspiest singer around? Brian Johnson overtook the crown a year later, but up to 1980 Nazareth reigned supreme. Originally I thought this one was SO much more mainstream rock than Hair of The Dog, but upon repeated listens, this one is just as heavy. It's played a bit tighter and the songs are crafted a bit better--- OO ya and if you like this, get Rampant too--- you won't be sorry."
4,Hard Rockin' 70's via Nazareth,"This is essential for Nazareth fans. LOUD crunching guitars and stellar vocals. Get a copy and ""May The Sunshine"" on YOU!(cool album art,too)"
5,Beautiful music!,"This is a beautiful Debbie Friedman album. She has a hauntingly exquisite voice. I love this collection of traditional Jewish music. It truly is ""renewing"" as the title would suggest."
4,A good book and GREAT tale!,"Alexander travels trough many obsticals to find the pilgrim Alice, join him as he battles, escapes, and finally meets the pretty pilgrim Alice. This book has good points and bad but in the long run it was a book worth reading. I would probably recommend this book to anyone interested in the middle ages because it takes place then and has lots of information on the holy grail, caliburn, The high king Arthur and middle Aged England."
2,"Well, what do I say...","I read from some reviews that Mary Stewart was an excellent author. This was the first of her books that I picked up and I was rather disappointed. There is hardly any adventure whatsoever and as for romance... well, the two leads only meet when the book is about to come to an end. If you want to read some GOOD STUFF I suggest that you try reading ""Outlander"" by Diana Gabaldon and ""The Princess Bride"" by William Goldman."
2,An insult to our intelligence,"I could not find a single character with any depth. I don't think I'm the only person who is sick of ""heroes"" who are thin, handsome and have a ""strong sword to keep the woman""; and Alexander is very stupid as well. Everything must be spelled out for him, and then he still doesn't comprehend. Also, Stewart's portrayal of Morgan le Fay is downright sickening. She is presented as a sex-starved, power-hungry, evil sorceress whom the supposedly great and wonderful King Arthur must ""keep in line"". For the most extraordinary version of the Arthurian legend, I believe that nothing beats Marion Zimmer Bradley's MISTS OF AVALON. Her women (especially Morgaine) are strong, intelligent, very interesting, and realistic"
2,irritating. a disappointment,"I am actually a devoted fan of Mary Stewart, ever since ""This Rough Magic"" I was hooked. However, ""The Prince and the Pilgrim"" is a mockery of both Arthurian legends and Mary Stewart's (usually) masterful talent. She couldn't have been in the right state of mind when this was written. Alexander the Fatherless has proven to be more stupid and irritating than any character i have ever seen on ""Baywatch"". And the only reason Alice isn't just as annoying is because the author neglected to write very much about her at all. Whatever happened to character development??? And a decent plotline???"
1,What a letdown,"Mary Stewart's Merlin trilogy was my favorite trilogy of all time, so I looked forward to this book eagerly, and was majorly disappointed. I bought this book in hardcover and it was a complete waste of my money. Even a paperback would have been a complete waste of my money, and borrowing it from a library would have been a complete waste of my time.Mary Stewart is quite elderly these days. She should have had the good sense to stop writing when she was still at the top of her powers rather than writing stuff like this."
4,GREAT BOOK!!,"i have to disagree with those who have said this book is poor, unadventurous, etc. this book is wonderful!!! Mary stewart has done a phenomenal job in writing this book. the two main characters are alexander and alice. one is a prince with a lost kingdom, the other a pilgrim waiting for marriage. this book tells the adventures that both go on, whether to the dark tower of morgan le fay or to Jerusalum, the Holy Land. this book is excellent, i can't wait to read it again!!"
3,Fairy Tale Story of Minor Arthurian Characters,"Mary Stewart who wrote one of the best Arthurian stories in her Merlin Trilogy, has highlighted the story of Alisander and Alice, who were very minor characters from the one of the oldest Arthurian legends. The story has the feel of a fairy tale and runs around the periphery of the original tale. If you are interested in Arthurian literature and want to know more about a couple barely mentioned in Malory, then I would suggest that you read this book, but don't expect the depth of other Stewart stories"
2,A Weak Plant From a Potent Seed,"Stories involving King Arthur and sundry acts of chivalrous derring 'do have always entertained me, so I was heartily disappointed in Stewart's novel, a return to the world of her Merlyn trilogy. Honestly, it seems like she simply ran out of gas or out of time. The novel sets up nicely, with two different plot threads that promise an epic resolution. Instead, the two main characters miraculously meet, fall in love and save the day, all in the space of about 90 pages. You know you are in trouble when you are reading a novel about the holy grail and one of the characters scoffs that it isn't the real holy grail, all the other characters agree, and everyone moves on. Yikes! I think Merlyn is rolling over in his crystal cave."
3,Prince,"Although not quite as interesting as the Merlin series, Prince and the Pilgram was entertaining and a worthwhile read."
3,"Ideal, Very Easily Imagined","I must agree with all the other reviewers. This book didn't have spark and vitality. These words here describe the ending of this book best: ""...and they lived happily ever after...."" so very simple. Not very dramatic. There was much to be done with this. It may have been best to arrange this into a series, instead of wrapping everything into one undescriptive book."
3,Lack of Depth and Constant Superficialities are Irritating,"The heroes were superficially ideal. Alexander, the prince, is handsome, dark-haired, muscular yet slender, and his lack of intelligence is made up for by his talent with the sword. Alice, the pilgrim, is pretty, slender, and adventurous yet feminine. There are many confusing legends included in this book, taking up pages with content irrevelent to the plot. Despite the superficiality of the plot and the too-good-to-be-true characters, the book reads surprisingly fast, though the complete lack of depth is often irritating"
2,"A well written, if not passionate, book.","Although this book is quite well written, with a satisfactory craftmanship of words, I must say that I was not particularly excited about this novel. It held my interest fairly well, but I didn't feel the flood of emotions truly good books always bring me. I liked the way both Alexander and Alice have, in their way, their own seperate sections, like how it explained their youth, but I didn't really enjoy how they didn't meet until close to the end of the book. It seemed short and fake when Alexander proclaimed his love to Alice, and lacked the ability to set my heart thumping and my eyes watering as a passionate romance novel may have. Since it was obvious how the book would end, I didn't feel the suspense or intrigue I expected. Although it may have its faults, it was not a completely bad book, and in the end, I would dub it ""okay""."
5,"""Dirty Work"" is unforgettable!!!","To say ""I am a Larry Brown fan"" is an understatement. ""Fay"" was my first experience and I was hooked! Then the marvelous ""Miracle of Catfish"" and ""Fathers and Sons""....but ""Dirty Work"" may just be my favorite. The power of these two characters and the way it builds to it's conclusion, well, it was like a punch to my heart! It's a ""must read"" for many reasons. One is to try to understand the effects of war, on body and soul, of those who go to war and return.It's a short book but enormous in scope! The relationship and compassion these two men develope for each other is unforgettable. The sadness I feel, that Larry Brown is no longer here to continue to write and move us to our core, is huge. His writing is a true American treasure."
3,Too long!,"This book makes the sixteenth century come alive. Time is devoted not just to events but also to characters who then have both depth and personality. If flows smoothly from one era of Mary's life to another, managing to inspire sympathy for the doomed queen despite her often self-indulgent and outrageous decisions.The major flaw in this book is it's length. At times it seems interminable and towards the end it is a relief to be finished with it. The quality could certainly have been improved by more ruthless editing. Overall however, this is interesting and makes history come alive."
5,An awesome book!,"I've read all of M. George's books (this one plus Henry VII and Cleopatra) twice. This book was wonderful. Though it's long, the way it's written will make it a page-turner and you won't realize you've read 150 pages. I learned so much about Queen Mary, Scottish history and the Reformation that I now continue to read books on the subject. No other book seems to compare to M. George's books, though. A. Wier definately comes close. M. George's style is captivating and makes the reader want to know more. I, too, cried at the end of this book, even though I knew the ending-- a nother reason why this book is a ""must read"" for anyone wanting to learn about Mary Queen of Scots."
2,Wasted potential...,"What a disappointment! The book starts out very good, and it's thoroughly engaging, but then George spoils herself (and the book, and the reader, and your appetite) with a series of sex scenes that are neither necessary nor remotely appropriate. Worst of all was the gay rape scene (yes, you read that right). The worst part was the utterly charming ending---why did she have to ruin it with such lewd descriptions? It felt as though you were suddenly reading some kind of sleazy novel. Very upsetting."
2,"Mary, I don't like you.",I struggled reading this tomb. I really enjoyed reading her Cleopatra book. What I finally realized was I disrespected Mary's decisions. I got the impression she was a rich bitch. I read about half the book and put it down because this is not a person I wanted to know anything more about.
2,I'm on Page 86....,"I am absolutely blown away by how different this book is than her Henry autobiography. Whereas the title would imply that this book is about Mary Stuart...the wedding scene alone disproves that idea. I know more about how her uncle was feeling during the ceremony than she did.So far, not a ringing endorsement for the rest of the book."
5,histfictlover,Margaret George writes another excellent historical fiction. She writes in such a way that you feel like an observer present in that time.
4,"An excellent book , a bit long , but seems well researched","By reading this book , I have learned quite a bit about this sovereign . It makes interesting reading and I can see that Margaret George must have delved into the history of the woman , England , Scotland and France ... A lengthy book but an enjoyable read ."
5,Margaret George makes you feel like you were there!,"I happened upon this book at the library about a year ago and fell in love with history. Once I started the book, I didn't want to put it down. Margaret George brought Mary back to life! In addition to getting to know Mary, Queen of Scotland, I also learned a lot about Scottish history. Naturally, once I finished this book, The Memoirs of Cleopatra was my next read. It was also incredible! Now I yearn to return to Scotland and Rome and to visit Egypt for the first time."
3,Only if you are a die-hard Mary fan,"In no way am I knocking the author or her research (LOVED the auto-bio of Henry VIII), but I lost interest about 1/3 the way through and only finished it by using it as a book to pass the time on the treadmill with . Maybe it is just me, as I love historical fiction and would typically devour a book like this in no time, particularly anything to do with the Tudors.I just couldn't get into Mary's trials and tribulations, as I found her to be silly, vapid and not the queen she should have been. Perhaps it was her upbringing in France that set the tone for her future choices. However, as stated previously, the author's writing and research is wonderful, I just didn't find myself interested in this particular slice of history."
4,"A magnificent achievement, but too long","I read this book a few years ago, but it has stayed with me as few books do. Ms. George is an incredible writer -- she brings to life vividly the period, the events, and the characters. But this book seemed too long to me -- so much detail, so much back-and-forth. Perhaps the problem was out of Ms. George's hands, however, since Queen Mary was a foolish, exasperating person. But somehow the reader begs for some relief while Mary is lurching from one crisis (often self-made) to another. Unfortunately, that relief doesn't come.A near-great novel, but flawed. For a truly great novel set in the same period, I cannot recommend too highly Ms. George's Autobiography of Henry VIII. Now THERE'S a fascinating character!!"
3,"A worthwhile read, but too drawn-out","Margaret George has obviously done a lot of research, and this book is a worthwhile introduction to the life and times of Mary, Queen of Scots. I was thoroughly engrossed for a good 500 pages. At a certain point, however, the events become quite predictable, and the descriptions are all the same. We lose all the interesting characters (except Mary), but alas, still 300 pages to go! These last pages are incredibly tedious. All they contain could have been condensed a bit more, which would have made the book far more tolerable. My advice: read the first half, then skim the rest."
4,Definitely worth your time,This book is very well-written and is really interesting. So I say it's a book worth reading.
2,slow and wordy,"Unlike most of Ms. George's historical novels this book is slow, drug out, and exceptionally wordy. I only finished half of the book. If you are interested in Mary Queen of Scots I recommed the movie by the same title because it mirrors the book exactly."
3,A daunting history,"I really wanted to like this book. I adore Elizabethan historical fiction!But I have not been able to finish the book. I know what lies ahead and I can't imagine how it takes that many pages to get to that inevitable tragedy.And perhaps I should not be reviewing a book that I have not finished, but I think that can also be just as telling of a book's worth as suffering to the end. At the point where I stopped reading, so much had happened and I was barely halfway through! I cannot imagine the rest of Mary's tragic life taking that long!But the writing is quality work, make no mistake. Margaret George's writing is rich, lush, and gorgeous. She is a talented lady, to be sure. The scenes where Mary has fallen into a ecstatic religious state in the French church still resonate with me.... So many beautiful moments, but not enough overall momentum.If you are already a fan of her work, you will probably enjoy this novel.And I am sure I will get around to finishing it eventually."
5,Fantastic!!!!!!,"Because of this book I went to Scotland and fell in love with scottish history! George wrote a wonderful book that opened a new world to me. She created Mary Queen of Scots into a character that I could sympathize with and cheer for.Although this book is ""long"" I couldn't put it down and was sad when I finished the last page.If only all historical novels could be of this quality."
3,"INTRIGUING, BUT JUST TOO LONG","I would love to give this book a higher rating because I think the author did a wonderful job of writing and research, but the fact is that this book was just too long. There was so much description that the story was lost in the details and although I have read 580 pages, I just can't bear to go on with it. Please Margaret, 500 pages or less next time."
5,Magnificent!,"If you love history-based novel, this is a must read book. I was so into the book that I cried while I was reading. Once you start reading it, you will find that it's so hard to put this book down. Thanks Margaret George for bringing back Mary, Queen of Scots to life at least in the heart of the readers."
3,You'll only read the first two sections,"Basically, Mary's life breaks down into three sections- her life as a child (spent mostly in France), her life as a young Queen in Scotland, and then her life in exile and imprisoned in the Tower of London. I plodded through the childhood part, *loved* and flew through the adventurous middle part, and then just gave up on the (boring) part in London. It isn't that it's too long- I read George's Henry VIII and was *very* sad when it was finished because his story was brilliant and entertaining. I realize that George is trying to make entertaining an extended stay in the Tower, but, well, good luck. The middle part is fascinating and is well worth it- just set your expectations because the tires come off the thing in part three. My 3 star rating above is really an average of a 5 star rating for the middle section, and a lower star rating for the later part (the first part is probably a 3-star-er.)"
3,"Very well-researched, but disappointing as a novel","I was very excited about reading this book, and I commend the author on her excellent research and insight into her main character. I learned a lot. However, as a novel, I think it lacks something. I don't think this lack is because the ultimate outcome is known from the onset--that's a staple of historical fiction. I think it is that Mary is a somewhat flat and unappealing character here. One other reviewer said that she is a potentially stong woman who makes collossally bad decisions, and I think that is a very wise comment. She is hard to become emotionally connected with, and the Lords, her political adversaries, and sometimes cartoonish in their villany. I stopped reading about two-thirds of the way through and skimmed the rest before returning the book to the Library."
2,"Good, but. . .","Okay, I picked up this book at the library expecting the best. I had read all those good reviews here at Amazon and I was expecting some phenomonal novel. Well, I began it, and found it a little boring until she got to France. Then it was wonderful. I read and read and by the time I got to Part II I was totally enveloped in Mary's (a woman formally too boring to interest me) story. Then Lord Darnley came in and the book lost its interest to me. The book was mutilated and changed into this barfable romance novel. Now don't get me wrong, I really like romance in my novels, but all of a sudden it was Darnley this Darnley that, and it portrayed him as a guy that he wasn't. And then came this horribly inappropriate scene between Mary and Darnley. I shrugge it off, though, but within fifty more pages there was another scene, except this time it was John Knox and wife. If you're offended wiyth stuff like that, then I don't recomend it. This book was a real let down."
4,Good Historical Fiction,"I was quite engrossed in the story of Mary's tragic life, up to a point. After about 500 pages or so, it became incredibly tedious. I don't know if that is because of Ms. George's writing, or just that the last part of Mary's life where she was imprisoned was incredibly boring. Probably the latter. This was obviously very well-researched, and I find it far more palatable to learn history this way than from the traditional history book."
4,Quite Insightful,"Although this book is terribly long and rather dense, if you can manage to get through it you will be rewarded with a portrait of a young girl terribly ill-suited to be a queen. I knew very little about Mary before, and now that I know more I feel like she is definitely a woman I would not want to spend much time with. She begins her life as a self-consumed pampered child more interested in dresses and parties than preparing for any future role she might have as a queen. When she does become queen, she makes all the wrong choices again and again, starting with marriage to a man everyone warns her against. This is a very interesting look at a headstrong child who becomes a headstrong woman determined to win and get her way at any cost. It seemed as though she never really grew up. A solid four stars."
5,Excellence in Historical Fiction,"I had read ""Elizabeth I"" by Anne Sommerset many years before, and I happened to stumble upon ""Mary"" in a book store. I bought it and was very engrossed the entire time!!! It was a delight to read Mary's story and to put a personality with the name I had read barely mentioned years ago! How fasinating to read the origional soap Operas!!! May there be a bit of Mary and Elizabeth in each of us! Highly recommended..."
5,This is a MUST READ,"If you love history and you love the British Isles this is a MUST. Margaret George paints a picture of a woman who is a queen but is human. Mary makes many decisions that cost her and her kingdom and you can see her undoing, yet you are helpless to prevent it. It is easy to relate to her, love her, despise her, and pray for her. Yet you know the outcome. All of this does not diminish her in your eyes. Read it, enjoy it, and feel her pain. Margaret George is a superlative story teller. All of her books are tremendous!"
3,Basic,"The projects in this book are more basic than in other books I've seen. There aren't any unique or remarkable designs and those that were interesting, I have seen done much better in other books. Also, I'm the type of person who likes to look at a project, figure out how to do each step, and do it my own way(feels more fulfilling at the end when you do succeed!). Hence, I found that this book was much too hand-held and at times the steps were so minutely set out, that I lost track of the 'bigger picture'. However, I would highly recommend this book to beginners."
1,Where did Lightscribe go?,"I was really, excited about Lightscribe. As I bought my HP, several other manufacturer's were coming out with Lightscribe burners too. The DVD 640i was for a new computer build. Never got around to burning a dvd, only loaded the operating system and programs. A couple months later I was looking at a driver cd and left it in the dvd overnight. When I tried to access the dvd the next day, it wouldn't open or read the cd. Never did get my cd back.Still, I wanted Lightscribe, so I looked for a replacement dvd burner. Couldn't find Lightscribe available anywhere except on HP's website. Was this a great concept but bad execution?"
2,Standard gay porn and erotica,"The editors, Paul J. Willis and Ron Jackson, claim that the stories in this collection ""chronicle unfamiliar aspects of desire and lust."" Frankly if anyone is familiar at all with any thing beyond the reproductive model of sex, I find it difficult to believe that the stories really live up to that claim. Of the stories in this collection, fewer than half, 7 in all, had characters that touched me on some level, making me want to reread the story. Most of the stories are written in the first person, the common point of view for much porn though not for most fiction. Given the point of view there is ample opportunity to help the reader connect deeply with the main character and yet most of the story fail. If you want a wide range of kinks and are only interested in the sex, then this collection may be just want you want. If you want more, I suggest you look elsewhere because there is some very high quality gay male SM fiction on the market."
1,A definite disappointment from a wonderful writer,This story looked like it was going to be about a group of people on a journey to the stars to find other life but instead we get all the politics and preparations and junk preceding the journey. The real search for other life only starts on the 4th-to-last-page of the book. The only things making this book barely worth reading are the characters -- but even they aren't like the author's other books' characters in terms of richness and depth.
5,Silver Hallmark Reference,"When it comes to identifying silver hallmarks, it doesn't get better than this. This is the basic reference throughout the silver hallmarks world. Does it include every hallmark that every was? No. No book does, but it includes more than any of the others, and it is set up for easy reference. If you are a jeweler, or an antique dealer, or silver collector, etc., this is the first book to own. Then you can add others to complement it, like one on American Indian silver marks."
1,Wrong Picture,I ordered this according to the picture which is of another product. I know is patially my fault for not reading the caption but I was in a rush. I't been a few weeks now and they still havn't corrected the problem.
3,WAY OVER PRICED,This is a fun toy and is totally made of plastic. The pieces can and do break off. The price on here of 49.99 is insane!It is sold in stores for 19.99 and I have seen it as low as 10.00 on sale. I am actually in search of a replacement car and would NEVER pay that. The price listed here is a RIP OFF for the ROAD RIPPER!!!!!
4,Police shouting orders... lots of fun,"My boss has this toy in his office for his child, who sometimes visits. The office workers end up playing with the darned thing. It cracks us all up, listening to the little cliche police voice clips. I had to get one for my nephew. Of course, if it was actually in my house, it would drive me nuts. ha ha ha. We can only handle about 20 minutes of it, but it's highly entertaining, especially when you let a little teddy bear ride around on it. Kids love it."
3,From heighths to the depths,"This disc roller-coasters from one of Trek's best episodes to one of its worst. ""Arena,"" in which Kirk faces off against a powerful reptilian enemy, has been a favorite of mine since I was a kid. The full-body monster suit is really high quality and holds up well even today. The frequent Trek moral about how we can all get along if we take the time to listen to each other gets one of its earliest expressions. Even the frankly ridiculous manner in which Kirk assembles his weapon doesn't detract from the fun of this episode.""The Alternative Factor,"" however, is pretty bad. It has a promising opening as cosmological disruptions on a galactic scale lead Starfleet to evacuate a whole area of space and leave the crisis in the hands of Kirk and crew. The payoff, however, is distinctly underwhelming. This episode is a confused mess with some of Trek's worst visual effects."
2,WEAK,"This book is just weak. No substance and mediocre science. Great pictures, though. If that's what you are looking for, buy it. The book simply surveys or brushes over about every facet of ""Marine Biology"" on the ecological, evolutionary and organismal level. The book is nothing more than a basic/general introduction to the second broadest subject in biology, second to ""General Biology"". The only thing that separates it from a Gen. Bio book is its concentration on marine organisms and ecology, which isn't especially enlightening or unique."
4,"Great Read, Interesting Topic",This is a great read and has interesting topics. The questions at the end of each chapter help you to evaluate what you read in a different manner. I enjoyed this book.
2,Boring for students!,My high school students struggle to read this book. They find the text extremely dry and boring. Pictures are nice though.
4,marine biology textbook,book was in the condition of which the seller said and i recieved it in a timely manner.
3,Black ink has a very short life ?,I got this printer a month back or so.I used is it to print hardly some 10 to 15 copies over the month.Most of the times I went to advanced settings and said use black ink only as it was just some documents and nothing that needed color.And with these few copies the black ink catridge is almost over ? Wondering if there is something I am doing wrong. If 15 copies need one full cartridge that is almost more than a $ for each page...Any other users ?No complaints on the quality otherwise.
3,Saving grace is waterproof ink,"Yeah, it uses ink like crazy, and the ink is expensive, but if you need waterproof ink, Epson Ink rocks. I tried the Canon ink, and black ink runs or smears long after it's dry. Epson ink is quite waterproof and weather resistant, and that works for me, as I use it for outdoor advertising (door hangers, and such). You can get a product like InkSaver if you don't network your printer, to cut down on ink usage."
3,Epson C88 Printer,"I needed an Epson ptinter to replace an Epson C86 which I bought from Amazon 18 months ago...So far, the Epson C88 prints well enough, but although the Ink is not finished, looking at the Ink left in the Cartridges, I tend to agree with others who have posted a review that this machine consumes a lot of Ink"
1,GARBAGE - Epson should be ashamed,"What a piece of junk. Sure the first week it printed fine. If you don't print with it everyday, the jets clog up. I was getting streaking galore the night before an important presentation. Then for no apparent reason it only printed magenta. I literally banged it with my fist really hard and the streaking lessoned - even after putting in brand new cartridges. Now i have $80 dollars worth of useless ink. Great. My C84 was only slightly better. Avoid epson like the plague. Phu Yuk!!!"
4,informacion lentes de sol,hola estoy muy conforme con mi compra los lentes son super comodos y quedan muy bien. Los cristales son resistentes y protejen la vista sobretodo tienen un super precio.
3,Not one of Dale Carnegie's best books,Decent audio book about resolving situations maturely & diplomatically. I feel that most of his good books were written already and now they're trying to re-create books with basically the same content and re-sell it. I recommend sticking with some of his classics like How to Win Friends & Influence People.
4,A good starter for anyone who is struggling to become assertive!,"I bought this book after trying several of those self-help books on assertiveness. I instantly liked the headline and its stated objectives. It covers some of the key topics on developing assertive behaviour. I liked the portion around improving listening skills, which was a good eye opener for me. Eventhough the book says that it's aim is to cover only certain types of skills, it goes wider than that, and hence at times lacks the depth that problem deserves. I take this book as one that can help identify the main weaknesses and provide some basic quick fixes to it. It should be followed by a detailed guide separately."
1,I was cheated. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,I kept thinking the author was just giving an introduction and Dale Carnagies written pages were to follow...... Never happened. I feel 100% cheated!!! Dale's writing is good. This writer is not a good teacher. Dale gives examples with all his ideas that help you understand. This man just says words and it makes you want to move to the next subject so maybe you can understand the next topic. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. It says it is written by Dale Carnagie. It is not. I am doing a charge-back on my credit card. My writing skills are better than this imposter.
2,not helpful,"I know a lot of self help materials basically talk about common sense that we already know. But at least most of them serve as a reminder and a lot of good ones lead you into further examining it and once in a while you come up with an ""Ah Ha"". However, this book seems to limit itself to certain situations. It doesn't give enough examples and the ""skills"" it mentioned sometimes just don't make sense."
3,"Good, but basic",The ideas are good for all. The format is overly repetitive and some of the examples seem a little simplistic.
2,Waste of Money,Bought this toy when my boy was 8 1/2 now a year has gone by and he played with it once. I read reviews on how difficult it is too close and they are true. It is just a little track inside a huge truck. Not worth the money. I would say that this toy is more for a 5 year old who likes to play with cars still.
1,EXPENSIVE PIECE OF JUNK!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY,"We bought this for our son for Christmas. Too bad the hummer isn't as it is represented on the commercial. It sounds like it is breaking apart when you unfold it, and it takes too much time to set up the track. The front hood keeps falling off no matter how you snap it onto the push pins. Folding it back up is a bigger nightmare. The hummer won't stay together and wobbles like an old jalopy when it is pushed like a car. We contacted Playmates and they indicated the ""breaking noise"" and hood falling off were normal. I would hate to see what they consider defective!!! Thank goodness we saved our box and receipt. We returned the toy to the store and got our money back. I wish the scale started at zero because we would have rated it zero stars across the board."
2,I am a little dissapointed,My mom got htis for me and although the concept is good I don't love it. It is a pain to put away by myself. i thought it would fold up but I have to take pieces off. Some are loose. The tracks are short. I like my hotweheels tracks instead. THe speedeez work great on them and that is OK. It is not that I can't do it it just takes too long and when you are a busy kid time counts. So I will use my other tracks till something better comes out. I do like the Hummer that came in it. The mini one.
2,Disappointed!,"My 7 year old son was thrilled when he opened this gift - something he really wanted. The raceway was easy to put together however, it it does not fold back up easily - if at all. The latches do not stay and most everything pops open once you try to pick it up (not mobile). Unfortunately, the speed launcher does not stay attached and we have to manually push down on it while launching.Very disappointed with the durability and agility."
3,"Great concept, awful quality",Don't consider this if you are buying for a youger child! It's too complicated for my son to set up and collapse by himself so he asks me to do it for him all the time. It's extremely annoying for a busy parent and the parts that are supposed to stay attached pop off easier than the ones that are supposed to come apart and fold. My son likes it but I HATE IT!
2,A Parents Nightmare! Playmates goldmine!,"I agree with most of the other reviews. This was purchased as a gift for my son, for Christmas. I wish I had checked it out before my son saw it, I would have returned it. Not only was it difficult to set up, it was more difficult to transform back into the Hummer. I find myself telling my son to play with it as a truck, not the city. What an expensive truck. Very disappointed. Never even heard back from Playmates when I tried to email them."
4,It takes some patience,My kids like this toy. After reading some of the bad reveiws I contacted Playmates. They responded very rapidly and were very helpful explaining the toy. You need to be patient and practice opening and closing it a few times. It is pretty nifty once you get the hang of it.
5,rating the speedeez hummer h2 speedcity,I looked forever for the speedeez hummer for christmas and everywhere I went it was sold out. I read the reviews and thought to myself with all the negative reviews I'm not getting this for my 6 year old. Well my best friend found it the week of christmas and got it for my son. He loves it and I think it is easy to fold and unfold unlike the reviews say. It is the best toy because it is 2 toys in one. Yah for playmate for a great toy
3,Quick to set up and put away?,"We couldn't wait until Christmas to give this to our 4-year-old son. And to be able to fold it up and put it away like on the commercial - a dream toy! Too bad they did not include instructions on how to put it away. Quite awkward - must remove and fold up track segments and stuff everything back into the car body so it can still snap shut. Good instructions for assembly, and for affixing the 28 little stickers, though. As for durability, the front section of the Hummer keeps coming unhitched when the set is open. This toy is NOT as represented on the commercial."
2,Hyped up commercial ... poorly made toy,"STAY AWAY! The commercial looks amazing but basically this is three short tracks and they just roll down them. Besides being quite boring, it took me over an hour to try to fold it back together and even then it wouldn't close. I put it right back in the box and returned it for something else. Also, the rep at Toys R Us told me quite a few were being returned. You would think such garbage would be pulled from the shelf. It was a lesson for my 4 year old on how things are not always how they appear on TV!"
2,disfunctional,why cant every thing be like the old tonka toys indestructable.i bought this for my 6 year old son.which he is quite carefullfor a little boy.the hummer 2 is a faulty toy it sounds like it is going to break every time you open it .he hood has already broken off 1one! day.forget trying to put it back to hummer mode. very unhappy with design. taking it back tommorrow!!!!p.s was not easy to find almost attacked in store because it was the last one. i wished ilet them have it
3,"Cool Idea, but not without serious flaws","My son was so excited to get this set, the speedeez cars are some of the best made, wish I could say the same for this set, you can't set up the play set without the front popping off. the tracks are flimsy, they tend to warp, its near impossible for a kid to close it up (or an adult for that matter) It broke after one day of play, the tracks snapped apart and its useless. A huge dissapointment for the money."
1,JUNK,"This toy was on the top of my son's Christmas list. As soon as we opened the box and took out the toy, my husband and I could see it was poorly made. We could not even open the truck without feeling it was about to break into pieces. I immediately got it back into the box and told my son we would bring him to the store for something else. I wish I had read the reviews here first, before purchasing."
2,Thank Goodness it's yellow because it's a LEMON!,"We bought the hummer for our son for Christmas, as most did. My husband pulled it out of the box, as my son's eyes gleamed with joy, but what with his wondering eyes did he see, a box full of poorly constructed yellow plastic with a hood that collasped in my husband's hands. The joints are poorly made and crack as you try to assemble it. Once put together it was . . . okay. Don't even try to resume into hummer mode, that is just not possible for a child to do by himself or herself! Yes, I could do it with patience as others have stated, however this is not an adult toy, but rather created for children to play with! The heartbreaking part is our son doesn't understand how or why Santa would make a toy that would fall apart(the hood) or was so hard for him to play with by himself. Needless to say it will be RETURNED! After all even Santa makes mistakes!"
1,Piece of Junk,"Playmates should be ashamed. What a piece of junk. This is not for anyone who wants a toy that lasts more than 1 hour. The tabs that keep the track together break too easily, the track pieces bend in ways they shouldn't bend, the mirrors on the truck make setting it up awkward. Just a piece of junk. You are better off donating your $40 than wasting your money on this."
2,I wouldn't recommend it,I bought this toy for my son. He wanted it for Christmas. It is not durable. It is a cute idea the hummer that turns into a race track. I would not recommend this toy for a child under the age of 12 years. It was pretty pricy for what we got.
2,Waste of Money,"We bought this for our 5 year old son for Christmas. It is a peice of junk! The peices don't stay together and every time we try to make it back into the hummer it sounds like it is breaking and peices fall off. My son likes the toy, but complains all the time about it falling apart. I would not bother spending the amount of money they want for this toy!!! I was VERY dissapointed in this toy!"
3,Hummm,I have bought this toy but now after reading the reviews I am concidering returning it. Doesn't sound good. Thanks for the advice...
3,Not worth the money,"This was supposed to be one of the highlights of my son's Christmas. Wrong. Just like everyone else, it was a pain to assemble; and I still can't get it to close up. That's supposed to be the cool part about it ... and we can't do it. And like another reviewer, the box went out with the trash and now I'm stuck with the toy. It probably won't get played with much because it's such a pain. When it is actually set up, it's a little fun-but the aggravation isn't worth the 15 minutes of playtime."
1,They should call this Speedeez BUMMER not Hummer,I wish I could rate this less than one star for the durability. It broke Christmas day before my son played with it. I am bringing it back tomorrow. The front part of the car slipped out from the plastic hinges and won't stay on so it just breaks. It's a good idea but just a piece of junk. Keep your receipts!
2,typical american composer,Like most American composers Howard Hanson is a little on the bland side. His 2nd symphony has some admirers although I'm not sure why. At least the CD isn't expensive so you can be bored cheaply.
5,One of America's best artists,"This recording is both wholly entertaining and inexpensive to buy. Mr. Hanson does a superb job conducting, as it is easy to hear the melodic line and recurring themes. I find this to be very good reading music (I usually listen to his 'First in e minor' it while reading the Lord of the Ring Trilogy)."
5,A Great Story of God's Provision,"""The Warning"" is a fictitious account of a looming economic disaster. God instructs banker Buddy Korda to warn his people of the coming crisis through a series of dreams. Buddy knows that the economy is strong, and the stock market has never seen such high daily closings (sounds very familiar). Will Buddy overcome his doubts and fears to warn God's people? Read ""The Warning"" to find out!"
2,NOT THE BEST,"IM FAMILIAR WITH THE WORLD OF DARKNESS AND THE HUNTER GENRE AND I ENJOY A ""well"" crafted vampire tale as well as vampire hunters etc,so i picked up this book hoping 4 a interesting read.......i didnt get one. now before i sound too harsh there are a few well written stories in the anthology but overall the stories are predictable and derivitive.the best way to make the fantastic seem plausible is to layer in as much reality and credibility as possible to help authenticate the incredible plus allow 4 an easy suspension of belief.it takes a fairly competent writer 2 pull it off and unfortunatly there doesnt seem 2 be 2 many on this collection.....most of the stories and characters are just 4 lack of a better word ....corny.the three standouts are the treatment of dr. eberhardt,the names of the dead,the frailty of humans and unusual suspects."
2,"I grew up in Minnetonka, the photo looks like Lake Superior, not Minnetonka!","I doubt the displayed cover photo is a reproduction from a historic Lake Minnetonka photo, it looks like Superior or a boundry waters lake."
4,Looks Natural,This ponytail wrap looks very natural with my hair color. Would have rated it a 5-star if it was a little wider.
3,Not to be listened to when you're feeling down,Every Tabor CD has a song you probably should avoid if you're feeling a bit down. While her voice is dark and rich as pure chocolate--there is also that bitter edge and you can hear it here.
4,Timeless telling of the Frank Herbert saga.,"This was a well produced movie attempting to tell the Frank Herbert Dune saga. It failed to completely please die-hard Dune fans, but was a credible retelling of the story. I come back every couple of years and view the film. I always enjoy it."
3,fixed the challenge,"bulb did not show up, but they worked with me and refunded my payment. thanks again."
3,Get what you pay for,"This is obviously after-market (although not obvious based on the name that the seller gave it!) It does not support two power levels (the projector disabled that setting when this was installed.) However, for now it works and we have our TV back."
2,Misleading ad,The listing said it was a Panasonic bulb. It was not. It was a made in China bulb that works but not as well as it should have. Not what I expected
4,Life Can Seem Unfair,"Yes, perhaps these ladies from Norway do sound a lot like the Bangles, but they do it so well! This is going to be one of those bands who didn't make it, broke up, leaving behind one blasting set for music hunters to enjoy. ""What Is Love"" is a strong rock anthem with slashing guitar licks and Laila Samuels' vocals holding the stage. My favorite track is what was the single, ""I'll Be Here."" It's got a slower grinding groove and a great melody with Samuels again nailing the vocal, ""When dreams seem far away do yesterdays keep haunting you? Do they bring you down? Well life can seem unfair."" Yes, it's sentimental, but it is a great track. Other songs show some sense of humor like on ""I Was Thinking of You"" about an unfaithful girlfriend who tries to make her affair seem a bit more acceptable. Sometimes great bands don't make it and the music biz can seem unfair. The Tuesdays is a great rocking set that is worth seeking out. Enjoy!"
4,Wonderful Pop Music,"The Tuesday ladies sure know how to take an old-fashioned styled American pop rhythm and craft it into something European, something bright, and something altogether new, yet never losing the root from which it stemmed. Samuels voice is nothing less than stunning and you can swear that even if she were to release ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"" as the band's next single, you'd be right out there buying it!!!What can I say, as a product of the synth-box 80's, I don't like today's ""hit-alternative, MTV, 14 year-old"" rubbish that is being manufactured faster than shoes in Indonesia, so I usually don't look at anything that's been newly released...ah-hem...except for these ladies. Fantastic.Norway looks to be aiming for the stars in the near future...with the new a-ha CD due out this fall (my favs!!!) and a NEW Tuesdays CD around Christmas (hopefully!!!). WOW!!!Take a listen."
1,didn't get it bancroft,I would love to be able to provide a review of this product but unfortunately although I paid for i I have never been able to get access to it. Therefore I don't think much of it at all
2,Poor writing and character development. How is Ludlum popular?,"Okay, I admit it, I don't do a lot of reviews. This book compelled me to at least state my opinion, albeit briefly. The summary: this bland ""spy thriller"" is about as engaging as a cold cup of airline tea. The characters (especially the protagonist) have no depth or development. The dialogue is awful. The story is uninventive and uninspired. I only give it two stars because I somehow managed to make it through to the end without dying of boredom. How is Ludlum a popular author?"
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZ,To think that a tree was chopped down to create the paper for this book. Ludlem probably turned over in his grave on the day it was released.
3,Ridiculous but readable,"I found this a good light weight vacation read. Picked it up at Hudson News. Left it at the Villa. I know in a year I won't remember the title much less the story. The main guy is no superman but has no trouble defeating the world, but he does so in an entertaining way. Its as fun to read as it is to pick apart the scenes"
2,A poor imitation.,The ghost writer was probably afraid to put his own name on the book. It was totally predictable without any of the depth found in real Ludlum books.
2,WHY I QUIT READING LUDLUM,"First I quit buying books with Ludlum's name on them, then I quite reading them . . . that was years ago and this mess brings it all back. I received the Bancroft Strategy as a birthday present from my daughter who takes gift-giving very personally, so I had to keep it. The only reason I give it 2 Stars is because I'm still reading it, waiting for two DeMille books I ordered to arrive. The stuff in this book is just plain D U M B. Definitely don't waste your money, and don't waste your time, unless you have a good reason to do so, like someone else's feelings."
1,Bancroft-Strategy for Failure!,"The sentences are confusing, in that you don't know where the main character is, or what is happening to him. Also, unnecessary blasphemy is offensive, juvenile, and shows no respect for the reader's beliefs, and sensitivities. It also shows a like of writing quality displayed in the older, more reverent authors, but is sorely lacking in today's writers. It's time authors learned to keep their anger, and rebellion to themselves, and not to offend their readership. Heck, if they were writing to the Islamic market, they'd be killed for this mistake! I on the other hand respectfully suggest that they keep their beliefs, or lack thereof to themselves, and to cleanup their writing style so as not to offend their readers!I Tossed this book in the garbage, after reading, not one, but several blasphemies in the prologue, itself!A note from a faithful reader; cleanup your writing style, and omit offensive language from your books!"
4,Good Read Overall,"I feel the negative reviews for this book are somewhat unfair. It is true that this book is a little formulaic and the dialogue is stilted at times, but the overall plot and flow are excellent. The book is a page-turner and will likely capture the attention of any suspense fan. It was an enjoyable read from start to finish."
2,Awful,"This book is terribly written. The plot was cryptic when it shouldn't have been and pathetically obvious when it was trying to foreshadow the ""twists"" in the story line. The dialogue seemed purposefully verbose and forced. I was really irritated by the number of descriptions that consisted of synonyms. If you're going to say someone is irately angry, just say that he is angry."
2,Bancroft A Miss,"I used to be a big fan of Robert Ludlum, but his latest books are just missing with me. The Bancroft Strategy has the Ludlum-standard fast-paced action and the twisting plot, but it never gripped me the way his earlier works did. And the gratuitous violence had me skipping over big chunks of text. Bottom line: If you're going on a long plane trip and someone loans you a copy of the book then go ahead and read it, but otherwise keep looking for something else."
4,"Good, but not great","I have mixed feelings about this book. Ludlum, if he did actually write the script, gave fanciful details about a rogue agent with moral ambitions (the ultimate mea culpa?).The story line was good, although I won't detail what so many others have already written, but there were some twists that bordered on the laughable.Most of the read was quick and allowed the reader the enjoyment of looking into the world of deep espionage, but so much of it was beyond reason.That being said, Ludlum did provide for some great action and his character detail is always interesting. He seems to be able to develop characters with carefully crafted detail without watering down the storyline.Overall I would recommend this book, but don't set the bar so high that you find disappointment at the end."
3,Repeats and re-blends old ideas,"This book simply repeats and re-blends old ideas from various novels by Ludlum, Robin Cook and others. Yes, there is considerable action in this book, but again, it seems a little overdone. How come many of the foes that the protagonist faces tend to be as competent as the protagonist and yet keep making obvious mistakes? Also, this theory that some one organization is pulling strings to change the world is simply too long running, right from James Bond times. I also find the ""Castor and Pollux"" thing very very mushy, especially between the super-agents that these folks are cut out to be. Can't these ghost-writers find other themes to write about? Definitely not in league with the typical Ludlum genre."
2,boring,"boring, boring, boring...after chapter 17 I was ready to toss the book but instead I went to chapter 24 to see if it got more interesting... hardly...this book does not compare very well to the Bourne trilogy...it took 24 chapter of f*ck-teasing before they finally got it on... but you knew from the beginning it was going to happen... very predictable???"
5,Ah-hhhhhhhhh ... I feel so fresh ... and beautiful too!,"I just scrubbed myself with a bar of good ol' dependable Dove. I feel like a million dollars. Am going to get my hair cut now, so I'll probably lure a whole new set of friends with my cocky new attitude.Amazon had photos of the Dove body wash right beside the bar soap (Beauty Bar? I hope so!), but being an old-fashioned gal I decided to stick with the tried-and-true. I love the silky feel of the soap against my skin, followed by the rough texture of the wash-cloth as it swirls it around. Ah-hhhhh ... and the smell is intoxicating--so fresh and pure. (I told you it doesn't take much to make me happy.)But now I see a product called Caress, and am wondering if that might feel even better. hmmmmmmmmmm ... If you try it, let me know.Reviewed by: Betty Dravis, 2008"
5,Most Excellent Reproduction,"This is a most excellent reproduction of the orinigal and is actually better in one way. Instead of being a bound book, it is in a binder. This means no spine to come apart, as well as keeping the cost affordable.This is the one cookbook that I grew up on and is what my mom used to feed her family of six with. The recipes are tried and true and is good basic food, not recipes that require ingredients that no one has ever heard of and cost a fortune to buy.Good recipes in a good package for a great price. What more can one ask for? If you are too young to know of this book but desire a good foundational cook book. This is the one to get."
5,A great primer for my granddaughter learning how to cook.,"My granddaughter and I use the recipes out of the Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook. What this book does is show, in good pictures, HOW to do different cooking skills."
3,retro cookbook,"This book was a replacement for the one my Mother gave me 35+ years ago. Some of the pages of the original book were stuck together! and I wanted to save some of the recipes. This book is pretty much like the old one, I don't like the notebook style, I prefer spiral binding and it is nothing like today's style with lots of lovely color pictures. Just a great old stand-by reference book."
4,charming and varied,"I ordered this book in december because I was looking for an old fashion baking book. So far I've been delighted with the sections on pies, cakes, breads and quickbreads. The fluffy pancakes have become a family favorite.I love the way it is set up with key recipes and several variations. For those looking for exciting entrees with exotic ingredients, look elsewere. this is a book of simpler fare but much suited for Monday to Friday cooking.There are several good ideas for what to do with leftover meats, charmingly called ""glorified leftovers"" . As well as pie recipes I had never even heard of before. Pear pie? Grape pie? orange meringue?Over all I like the book because it has a large variety of recipes all in one spot even if I already knew how to make some of them."
3,A bit dull if you've never seen the original,"I think this cookbook is perfect for those people who remember or want to replace their 1950's version. For those who never saw the original...this cookbook will probably seem old-fashioned, out-dated and a bit on the dull side in terms of recipes.I like good old-fashioned home cooking....but this cookbook seems to take an almost *too* simple approach. Not a lot of photographs or variety of recipes. Although it does provide useful information for the starter cook....I'd recommend ""The Taste of Home Cookbook"" over this one for a great, general-purpose & information cookbook."
2,Bad cookbook,I'm getting rid of this cookbook. I didn't read the description enough. I didn't realize it was a cookbook printed in 1950. The recipes are simple and not alot of ingridients like the newer cookbooks. The first time I went shopping for the ingredients my grocery cart was about half full as usual. The cake recipes I tried are very dry. I thought the recipes would be better but I'm used to newer recipes. The flavors aren't there.
1,The book I got is not the one pictured.,"I got a different book than the one in the photo. The one in the photo is acutally very good. The one I got is about how to use canned soup to make meals. I never use canned soup. I really wanted the other book, in the ring-bound format I ordered."
2,Big Disappointment!,"After the much-bally-hoo about this book, I bought it......big waste of money......It's ok if you want basic recipes, such as a basic chocolate cake, and such......does not live up to the hype, in my opinion......Guess people think ""Betty Crocker"" translates to ""Bible""....."
4,looking back with my tummy,The book brought back wonderful memories when my mom used the very same one to prepare our favorite meals..I relived many evenings in my mind as I read through it and found recipes mom used to make..The book is full of memories and scrumptious recipes and I will cherish it and continue to use them myself.
5,It's a Winner!!,"I currently own a copy of the original 1950 Betty Crocker Picture Cookbook. I learned to cook from this book, and now my children will be able to have their own shiny, new copies to learn from too. You can't go wrong with this cookbook since the book is crammed full of delicous, easy to prepare recipes. Also, the photos and directions make cooking easy for both novice and experienced cooks alike. It's a winner!!"
4,Question,"This is really a question rather than review: do the recipes include nutrition information (calories, fat, protein, etc.)?Betty Crocker's Picture Cookbook"
3,Good,I am still getting used to this book. My wife has a older Betty Crocker's cook book and it is easy to use. Once I get familiar with this book I will like it more.J.R.Misra
3,BC Cookbook bought on Amazon,"This book was a replacement to the one I lost a few years ago. Although it is the same as my original in all respects I was very disappointed to see that it was re-produced in CHINA. The paper that it is printed on is not as thick as the original and rips very easy. However, I did rip out the page that said ""Made in China"" making my book minus 2 pages."
5,The best of Heirloom cookbooks.,"I still have mine since fifty years ago. I bought two to give to two of our daughters. One because she hound me for it, the other because she is a chef patissier and always ask for my recipes. I still used the recipe on page 78 for the best doughtnut ever made and on page 339 for marveleous dessert cakes, specially for this time of the year."
4,A little disappointed,"I read the discription of what was in this book, but I guess, because it was a Betty Crocker cookbook, I still expected more. It's very plain, a little on the skimpy side, and maybe not usable, but interesting to see how things were back then."
5,So glad dto find this!,"I have always loved to cook. This was one of the few cookbooks that my mom had. As a small girl I would sit and look at the pictures. Mom bought this for me a few years ago and it brought back many memories. Since then, I have purchased one for each of my children. It's a cookbook that doesn't use 'mixes' to complete the recipe. It's a ""from scratch"", every-day, basic, cookbook. Lots of memories inside if your mom or grandma had/has one!"
4,cook book review,i recieved the book in a very timely manner andeverything was great with one exception .. my book isring bound and one of the rings is offset just a scooch...makes turning the page a bit .. oh .. offset id say... anda tiny portion of the inside corners of some of the pages arestuck together and when i turn them i almost tear them apart...other than that everythings fine and im happy to have this cookbookin my hands again... its been a favorite since i was 16 years old..
5,This is the first cookbook I recommend,"I am thrilled that Betty Crocker has re-issued this cookbook. My mother received a copy back in 1956 as a wedding present and it is the one I learned to cook from. I still use it more than any of my other cookbooks. The recipes are just ""plain home cooking"": no fancy ingredients, no complicated cooking techiques. However, I have never made a dish from this book that has failed to get compliments. It is a good book for beginners as well as the rest of us whose skills fall somewhere between ""burns water"" and cordon bleu."
3,Betty Crocker CookBook,I expected a larger variety of recipes. Although very concise and a variety of recipes from appetizers to main dishes and soups it was not what I expected.
5,Betty Crocker's Picture Cookbook,I'm thrilled to have this edition of the cookbook. It replaces an original 1950's copy I have had since high school!
4,the gift that keeps on giving,"this was a gift for my mother-in-law. she had used it all the time and loved it very much but gave it away so that her brother could enjoy cooking in his new home. she has missed her cook book for about 20 years, i got her a new one and a smile was instantly put on her face from ear to ear.betty is always a great cook and she makes you look like you are one too."
5,How cool this is.......,"I was born in 1957 and this is a 1950 cookbook. This book is so cool, I love it. The pictures are really cool too.I like it because you don't have to go to the store and search for all those weird unheard of ingredients. This book does not call for anything that is not in your cabinet. It's a wonderful book. You won't go wrong with it."
4,Great Cookbook,The cookbook is just like the one from the 1950's! My mother's original one was worn and missing several pages. I was so excited to find this for her.
3,just another book,"I like the binder aspect, but the recipes are nothing special. It was interesting to look at pictures from ""long ago"" when I was a kid."
5,betty crocker picture cookbook,"I knew what I wanted. My daughter had worn out her original cook book and wanted another one like it. Didn't know they had revised and made a new cook book. This has many of the same recipes in it, besides being updated. She loves it, and her family is equally happy with the end results.My order came quickly, the price was right."
5,a classic,My grandmother taught home economics for 40 years. She used this cookbook all of my childhood and swore by it as the best basic cookbook you could use. When she passed away I cleaned out her house this was one of the most prized and cherished items I took home. She had used the book for 40 and I have now used it an additional 13. Everytime I cook Thanksgiving dinner or any other big family meal I turn to the pages of this book. It may not be the fancy digital age cooking some of the new books offer but it is the best of the basics. My book is 53 years old and is falling to pieces. I know I should buy a new one for my self but I just can't give up this one. I purchased this cookbook for my nephew and his fiance for a wedding gift. they love it and have told me they use it often I am planning on purchasing one for each of the new brides in the family for many years to come. They may have many good cookbooks in their life but this one will be the best.
5,I WON THIS COOKBOOK WHEN I WAS 17 YRS OLD,THIS BOOK CHANGED MY LIFE FROM ATHLETICS TO COOKING. AS A 17 YR OLD I WON A 1955 CONTEST FOR BEST HOMEMAKER IN HIGHSCHOOL AND RECEIVED THE 1950 EDITION ALONG WITH A BETTY CROCKER GOLD PIN WHICH WERE AWARDED IN THE SCHOOL AUDITORIUM OF BASSSETT VIRGINIA I STILL HAVE THE COOKBOOK AND THE PIN. AS A GOURMET COOK TODAY I STIL REFER TO AND USE REGULARLY MY 1950 EDITION OF BETTY CROCKER'S 1ST EDITION.
3,not what I expected,"So so............; pages are flimsey. What do you mean 'fifteen more works required?"". Since when must a review contain someone elses requirements?"
5,Basics/Classics Revisited,"""Betty Crocker's Picture Cookbook (Betty Crocker)"" is the first cookbook I ever used as a child of five learning to cook, and is still one of two cookbooks I give to budding ""wanna be"" chefs who need to learn the basics. It is clear, concise, and builds your confidence with easy to follow directions and pictures that make you feel like a pro!"
3,"NOT The ""Original Cookbook""","My wife wanted an exact replacement for her wornout original version (approx. 1957). This new book, although it may be good, was deceptively advertised as the original. Pretty sneaky on the part of the publisher. They sold a lot of books to trusting Amazon customers. I think they owe your customers an explanation and appolgy."
3,great teaching video,This is a nice video for children going to school or daycare for the first time. It shows how Molly handles her fears about attending a new school and trying to fit in. She brings her stuffed dinosaur for security. At the end of the day her dinosaur is in her cubby and she is one of the class.My son watched it over and over the week before he started kindergarten.
4,THE LIFE OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER,"Provides insight into what led to the construction of the trade center along with the history of the building once it was opened in 1970. It seems to be that the trade center will have the similar legacy to JFK in that too much time is spent on it's demise, not enough on it's life. This documentary is the exception.In short, If you're looking for a documentary into the birth, and life to the twin towers, you'll appreciate this .If you're looking for 9/11 material, This probably won't suffice except for some backgrounds Into on the construction of the towers."
1,Didnt work,It will not play it on my DVD player and it is too much hassle to send it back for another one. Sorry.
1,One of her worse,"I enjoy a lot of the lyrics in Pink's songs but this one was just inappropriate and sadly ignorant of certain issues. She doesn't seem to know the President at all when addressing him or his policies. Not to mention she just mirrors current secular society that really doesn't understand consequences. This is the jest of the song especially in relation to moral issues. Yes, some of the lines are true and I do feel politicians rarely know what the average person suffers (I'm sure the new president, Obama doesn't know either given both him and his wife are rich and have been for quite some time). But there was too much wrong with this song."
4,Good Tube,Bought this for my son's bike. He and I installed it with a new tire andi t was very easy to work with. I suggest you blow it up a little and get all the folds out of it before install. Defalt and it goes in tire easily. Has been holding air since day one and is on a daily rider. Good tube for the price.
3,"Sturdy, but small opening","This hose is not standard and restricts water flow (smaller diameter at the connectors). For my purpose (adding water to my radiator system) it was not a negative, however, not sure how it would work on an actual washing machine given water pressure."
4,Good but not what I wanted,"This item is good, but I thought I was ordering the actual book and this item is the screenplay--I just didnt read the description well enough"
4,Excellent,The book met my needs and it was in pristine condition. I was very happy with my purchase! Thank you!
5,A Great Read,"This volume collects Annie Proulx's short story ""Brokeback Mountain"" (first published in the New Yorker and collected in her ""Close Range: Wyoming Stories""), Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana's screenplay, a short piece called ""Getting Movied"" by Proulx, and a piece by each screenwriter. As such, it offers good value for money for what you get.I don't normally buy screenplays, but the film is so beautiful and the adaptation from the story is of such quality that I wanted to own the screenplay. The film is, quite simply, a work of extraordinary genius by a director who is now at the height of his powers. The screenplay, too, is of uncommon quality. You should own this. Simple as that."
3,It's ok if you like cowboy movies,"I had to purchase this book for a college course, otherwise I probably would never have read it. I found it boring and realized that it's probably better suited for either men who like cowboy stories, or people who are into studying how to create a screenplay from a move. The screenplay stays very true to the short story. The best part about this book is the essay in the back by Proulx. I suggest you read it before you read the short story as it answered my main question, which is why a straight woman in her 60s would write a story about rough cowboys who were having trouble accepting their sexual orientation."
5,Welcome back Chris Franke,"Welcome back to the TD sound you have pioneered and visioned. Back are longish tracks, different progressions, moods and the sophisticated titles reminiscent of your stint with Virgin. The Franke sequencer attack is present here and most of all that subtle but powerful melodies you hear from his TD albums particularly Tyger, Canyon Dreams and Underwater Sunlight. The only thing that I appreciate when TD members go solo is that on each respective albums, one can distinguish their past contributions to the new albums they released. No matter how the past TD members would create a new identity and escape their TD past, the fans would always long for and value their umbilical cord to Tangerine Dream."
3,Precision Shooting,"There is much good information in this book but it is difficult to dig out. Diagrams are all in the back of the book but are referenced throughout the writing making it difficult to view them as one reads the material. I found the writing to be disjointed and often confusing, although, I did use the information to help improve my trap shooting. It was a difficult read and could use a good editing. This book is not for the beginning trap shooter and as the author states you should read his first book, Trap Shooting Secrets, before attempting this one. I have read both of the books and they both are a rambling discourse on the sport of trap shooting containing information that is useful for the reader if one is patient and will search it out."
4,Well written with a lot of information,"A very comprehensive book for the advanced trap shooter. I could find a lot of useful tips and techniques even if my skil is below proffesional trap shooting. I could not rate it with 5 stars because of the two main tesis, the mental and visualisation issues. I simply do not believe that visualisation is an universal thruth which can be applied by everyone and this should also be valid for the mental part. By definition, since we all are individuals there are no standard solutions but the book is however worth buying!"
1,Look elsewhere,"I truly believe there may be some good information in this book. I am unsure if you will be able to read enough of it to get any of it. It is so poorly, no let me restate, so OVER written as to be laughable."
1,Shame on Epson,"I bought a similar model, the CX4600, a little over a year ago and it will no longer print, no doubt due to one of the maladies noted in the reviews. Emails back and forth to Epson achieved nothing. Servicing it is pointless since it would cost more that the cost of the printer to have anyone begin to look at it. So it's off to the landfill. What are we doing to our planet with all the planned obsolescence in the computer hardware industry?"
4,This printer is awesome !,"I read several reviews before deciding on the Epson All-in-One. So far, it has been great. The pictures that I have printed look wonderful, even on plain paper. Setup was a snap. So far an Epson has never failed me."
2,I regret buying this.,"This printer has been a major disappointment. While the cost for the features seemed great, the ink runs out quickly and printer heads need to be cleaned frequently, thus using even more quickly. The print quality is just plain sad. Photos? Forget it. Even documents do not print with crisp, clean fonts. It's slow, too.I'll avoid pigment ink printers in the future."
1,Did not last,"This printer broke before I could refill the ink. My sister had one and it did the same thing. I now have a Brother Laser All-in-one and the HP Photosmart 2700 and no problems. Epson quality is very poor. Stick with Brother, Samsung, or HP."
2,wouldn't suggest this,"the scanner works really good...but if you do not use the printer for a while, it says you are out of ink and have to replace the cartridges...not a really good 'all-in-one'!"
1,Don't Buy Epson,"Epson printers have a design defect that causes them to fail between 6 and 18 months. Just read the reviews for other Epson printers. When you call customer support they will offer to repair it, even though the warranty may be up. After buying a box and the packing to protect the printer, you will be out another $10. Do yourself a favor, look elswhere unless you don't mind being without a printer for 6-10 weeks."
2,Ink sucker,"Good looking output, and a inexpensive printer...but by the time you keep it fed, it is not inexpensive. The ink ends up costing you more than the money you saved..."
4,good for the price point,I found everything about this printer sufficient. It does eat up color ink fast so I use it for b&W; printing. You can always get prints really cheap these days from drugstores anyway.The scanner works fine and the software is easy to use. I only wish it came with a usb connector. You would also think that at this point wireless printers would not be so expensive. Oh well. My scanner broke down and it was cheaper to get in all in one than just another scanner. My old epson was 8 years old and still kicking though. However it was getting harder to find cartridges from generic makers. I hope this one lasts just as long.
1,I wish there was a -5 stars for any epson printer,"I am never buying an Epson again! I have had an Epson printer from the first time I bought one, the last one I purshased was like 7 years ago and finally I could not find ink cartridges so I went to buy a new one thinking that since the last one was great I should have no problems, think again! they claim a rebate buy they give you a debit card that if you don't use quick it drains the funds immediatelly! The ink costs just as much as the printer and they go fast very small and then 15 days after the warranty expired...the damn thing broke, besides their costumer service is awful, they don't have a free 1800 number and they take forever to tell you that there is nothing they can do so you have to take it to their repair service.....trust me, do not buy an epson...buy other brands instead, this company is going down"
2,"Fair quality, but not economical","We have owned this printer for a few years now. We print occasionally at best, and my wife prints a few photos and high quality stuff here and there. But we seem to tear through ink pretty frequently. And just today I had to replace all three color inks when they were still half full. The unfortunate thing about this printer is that the software refuses to recognize the ink once a certain amount of time or prints have passed. If you still have ink or not. I actually got word that there was a class action law suit against Epson for this very reason. Its really very sad. But it prints pretty decently, though."
4,Great item,Looks and works great.As decribed in ad. Fast shipping also.I purchased for Mother and she likes it alot. Very easy to use.
5,Dorati's Respighi milestone,"Dorati was always one of Respighi's biggest champions and it's too bad he didn't get around to recording more. This disk is a delight to have in Wilma Cozart's excellent rehab of her own original tapes.While the other works are among the best recordings of them made, it's the Brazilian Impressions that excites the most. Like Milhaud, Respighi was astounded by his trip to Brazil and opened up a creative horizon for him that counteracted his serious, depressive illnesses. The Impressions indicate a direction that led to other triumphs like the great ballet ""Queen of Sheba"", the opera ""Maria Egiziaca"", the sublime orchestral ""Metamorpheosen"" that gives any great orchestra a workout like Bartok's Concerto.If you have the old LPs, stick with them because there is an element of dynamic splendor somehow muted here. But if your LPs are to the point where there is more scratch than music, buy this disk and keep these old friends in your life."
2,Terrible sound,"The sound on the Pini and Fontane is really a horrible experience. Gli ucelli, recorded in London has a much better sound and a better orchestra, at least I think so. Dorati is usually good and reliable and so he is here but Respighis music is actually not so much to write home about."
3,"A brilliant thinker, a dreadful reader","After establishing a brilliant theoretical framework Sedgwick provides utterly unconvincing and tediously reductive readings of literary works by Shakespeare, Wycherley, Dickens, and others. Read the introduction and then skip the rest."
3,The origins of queer theory,"This book is an essential antecedent to contemporary queer theory, arguing that the development of the public sphere depended upon a sublimated yet necessarily erotic ""male homosocial desire."" Once we have finished encountered that stunning and revolutionary idea, this is a work of literary criticism that will be of little interest to non-scholars. Sedgwick has proven herself more than adequate to the task of adapting her ideas to a larger academic and educated general audience; indeed, she is one of the most provocative cultural critics of our generation. But not here. I suggest some of Sedgwick's later work, especially ""The Epistemology of the Closet"" and ""Tendencies."""
3,Authentic Catholic Woman,"The book was not new, or close to new. The condition of the cover and pages was decent but I do not remember there ever being any mention of writing and underlining in the book."
3,"Not glam, Not COuntry however","That other reviewer apparently was high when wrote his review. this is the eponymous debut from gary Moore's Power ""Rock"" trio ""Skid Row"", not the glam metal band from the 80's, however Country? This is NOT country, this is NIT country rock, this is definitely bluesrock orientated , say influenced by the likes of Cream, genesis, Eric Clapton, kimi hendrix, but Country.Otherwise, this is okay I have 3 of these 9 songs ( i have a friend that owns this) and I will say from what i've heard that is is okay?"
1,"Very thin, & like shoe leather","The flavor is ""O.K."" Won't buy again! Very thin, and very tough! Can get any generic brand with this texture! Expected thick and soft from the description...NOT! Not worth the price at all! I eat a lot of jerkey for the low fat/high protein, but won't do this one again! Disappointed!Jen"
1,Bad beef jerky,I agree with Michael Whitney from Seattle. The beef jerky tasted ok but was tough as leather to chew on. I won't be buying this brand of beef jerky again.
3,my problems with this model,This model makes an excellent cup of coffee however I have had two problems with this model: 1. very difficult not to have some spillage when pouring a cup of coffee and 2. air pockets in the water level indicator so it is difficult to know how much water you are putting into the coffee maker if you rely on this device. You can remedy the problem for a pot or two by placing the coffee maker upside down for a few hours however the problem will return.
3,Patricia from South Carolina,"I have had several Krups coffeemakers in the past few years and have generally been fairly pleased with their products. This most recent purchase of has not lived up to the previous purchases.The first coffeemaker I received was defective in that the water did not flow through the channel. I contacted Ace (which you must do within three days of receipt of the product to receive a replacement) and received a label to return the item via UPS. It took the compmany another week to send a replacement.I have used this coffeemaker now for over one week. I do not like the fact that the timer comes on daily automatically. My previous coffeemaker required me to turn on the timer which I did when placing coffee in the system for the next day. It would also have been nice to have the light on the clock luminated at all times rather than only when the system is in use. Overall, If I were to purchase a new coffeemaker it is highly unlikely that I would select this type again."
3,Krups coffee maker,"This makes excellent coffee which is why I bought it.That being said,I found this to be overbuilt and confusing to use.The set up to program it for time activated coffee is cumbersome.The bright light is annoying, and I do not like that you cannot just turn it on to keep the hot plate warm for heating up coffee.The glass carafe seems poorly made and the lid does not come off for cleaning.The owner's manual is poor at best. It does,however, make good coffee and doesn't drip on the plate when you pour coffee like a Mr Coffee I owned previously."
2,Disappointed!,"After a bad experience with an ultra-cheap Mr. Coffee from Amazon(not Amazon's fault,of course), I bought this decidedly NOT-cheap coffeemaker with high hopes. It worked fine -- for less than two months. One morning the water reservoir began to leak dramatically for no apparently reason. Quickly returned it to Amazon for refund.Buyer beware!"
5,Krups Coffeemaker,"Used one previously. Found that it is the best coffeemaker we had used, so we purchased another one. The cone filter makes the full flavor of the coffee great.Reliability is another good feature for coffee drinkers."
4,"Love it, but ...","I've owned Krups coffeemakers for more than 20 years (10 years per machine is a pretty good track record). So far this one has done a fine job. But, as other reviewers have pointed out, the problem is the carafe. It's not up to Krups standards. The glass walls are thin, so you do have to handle it gently. And no matter how carefully I pour, it leaks coffee on the counter! After a few months, the handle fell apart and won't hold together. You can buy a replacement carafe from Krups (for about $20, I think) -- but I got one of those universal replacement carafes for about 10 bucks. The universal carafe fits the machine, the glass is at least as thick as (maybe a little thicker than) the Krups original, the handle is sturdier and the lid stays upright while I'm filling the carafe with water. And it doesn't leak!"
1,Series of defects and angry in-law,"As an electronic technician I can repair anything...except this coffee maker. I believe it has been discontinued but thought I would add comments for historical value. Yes, there are bubbles in the fill tube, much of the coffee spills on the counter, cabinet doors and floor and the water sensor fails all the time. You have to empty the unit, let it completely dry and then it works again for a year...maybe!When my sweet dear wife brought it home from B, B and Beyond, it looked so good in our kitchen. My mother-in-law was the first to use it and she spilled coffee all over the counter. We had words.Then, I thought I was getting senile as I too spilled coffee everywhere. Dang! Now, I had to make the apology call. Guys? Throw this coffee maker in the trash. Do not try to sell it. Do not try to repair it. Go on Amazon and purchase a coffee maker after researching for a new product."
4,"Good coffee, hard pour","I love Krup's coffee makers, always have. Only problem with this model is pouring the coffee into a thermos. If you don't open the lid a little it backspills all over your counter. If you hold the lid open a little, remember your oven mitts because the steam will burn your thumbs. Makes great coffee!"
2,Not a good choice,"We have two Krups coffeemakers from many years ago, and love them. They make the best coffee ever! We needed a third coffeemaker for another office. After researching a number of Krups machines, this one seemed most like the ones we have. However, we found it highly inadequate! We were not expecting the construction to be as good as our old Krups machines, but we were NOT expecting that it would leak water! We struggled with it for sometime, but no matter what we did the coffee was bitter. We chose to use a Cuisinart instead. With the Cuisinart we have to use much more coffee, but it tastes much better than the new Krups."
3,BROKE THE SECOND DAY,"I gave this product 3 stars because it makes good coffee, as all the Krups coffeemakers I've owned have, BUT the water gauge on the side broke the second time I used the machine. Could not be bothered to return it, but I do find it annoying. Even more annoying is the fact that it seemed reconditioned, and not NEW, as I had ordered."
4,Too many gagets,My wife's favorite coffee pot is a Krups. Our old one died and we tried some other brands which were not as good as the Krups. We were unable to find one in the local markets (except for the more fancy types). So we ordered one from Amazon. It too had some buttons and bows but it is satisfactory.
3,A drippy carafe,I must pour coffee over the sink because the carafe will create a small puddle on the counter. The clock is only visible while the coffee is brewing and even then the lighting has a blue background and difficult to read. The previous Krups 12 cup coffeemaker this on replaced had the same features bkut was a better product then this new one.
2,Disappointed...,"This thing blows...literally. It sounds like an old-fashioned percolator while it's brewing; spitting, hissing and popping. It releases about 1-1/2 cups of water as steam with each brew cycle. We have had several similar Krups units over the years (the last one lasted four years and a month) and they all seemed to work well enough. We had the carafe and gold filter from the last one so, we ordered a replacement instead of changing horses. Setting the clock/timer is a pain, but works. In my opinion this unit is not up to the standard of past Krups appliances that we have owned.Maybe I should buy a percolator (or stick with my french press)."
2,Coffee okay - everything else pretty bad,"Pros - It does make a pretty good pot of coffee. I'll give it that much.Cons - several1. Carafe drips *badly* unless you hold open the lid. Then the steam burns your hand.2. Cannot turn off that annoying audible signal - beeeeeep beeeeeep . I was able to turn it off when I first got it following the procedures in the manual, but now I cannot get it to do so despite following them exactly as written.3. Too expensive for what you get."
3,great coffee; terrible carafe,"This is the second Krups I have purchased - same model. It is one of the only coffeepots that heats the water hot enough to make good coffee. However, the carafe drips (and not just a drop or two) every time I pour it -- when I pour the water into the coffee maker or when I pour coffee into a cup. Have gotten a thermal carafe so it only drips once.The other problem I have is with the measuring gage for the water -- it gets a bubble in it and therefore doesn't measure correctly.All in all it does make good coffee -- the other items are constant irritants."
2,Another disappointing coffee maker,"The settings on this (time, program time, etc) are both confusing and unnecessarily complex. The smallest of power outages require a full reset, since there's no internal capacitor to compensate for such an event.Brew temperature is ""warmer"" than most, but still can't approach what one would expect from virtually any restaurant.The water level site glass isn't properly designed and is subject to forming air bubbles, which quickly render the feature useless.The carafe is clearly an exercise in cost-cutting, since it's very thin, has no removeable lid (for proper cleaning) and relies on adhesive pads to kepe the handle in place.Can ANY MANUFACTURE design a home coffee brewer that's well-made, user-friendly, reliable AND makes hot coffee?"
3,It's ok...,Nothing special. Thought I would do some research on a good coffee maker. Hubby and I love coffee and trying all kinds from around the world. There is nothing special about this coffee maker! Can't adjust the brew strength. Basic coffee maker. Has no unplug time memory so whenever I am cleaning the counters and unplug it I have to pull out the directions to reprogram the time. My husband actually wants our leaky Mr. Coffee back. Does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING SPECIAL!!!
1,puddling on the counter,Our Krups seemed to be fine for about 7 months. Now it has begun spitting water from the brewing basket over the outside of the carafe and onto the hot plate where it sizzles and then puddles under the coffee maker. I see this as an electrical hazard and when I called customer service was told that while it was under warranty I needed to pay shipping from Phoenix to a service center in CA and they would return it in 2-3 weeks. This is an inferior product and I have no reason to believe their service would be otherwise..
1,Piece of junk,I have owned Krupp coffee makers for years. This one is a piece of junk.Avoid it at all costs. I went to Williams-Sonoma and bought their Krupp for >$100 and it works great.
1,Disappointing,"The coffee pot spills when try to pour unless you are super slow and careful. We ended up putting our cups in the sink when we poured from the carafe, that's how bad it was. Even after 7 months, we were unable to consistently pour without a big mess. The rubber band in the part of the coffee maker that holds the filter (the cone-shaped part) broke, and we had to get a replacement. The replacement came off in the dishwasher and we had to get a re-replacement. Then after 7 months, the electronic pad stopped working. For us, that's 3 defective elements in one machine! I'm replacing this right now, with a different brand. We owned our first Krups for over 10 years without incident. This one was cheaply made and poorly thought. Beware."
2,I returned it.,"The coffee maker is mostly fine - makes pretty good coffee, but not as good as the old Braun maker it replaces. My problem is with the carafe. I have had this coffee maker for a week, and only one time have I been able to pour coffee from it without it dripping. I've tried pouring fast. I've tried pouring slowly. I've tried lifting the lid a little bit, but then the steam is too hot on my hand. I asked at the store I bought it from if other people complain about this coffee maker, and she said yes, frequently. She said she would gladly exchange it or give me a refund. She suggested a Cuisinart unit that wasn't much more $$."
1,Known design problem plagues this Model,"After a few years, my older model, and very dependable Krups coffee maker died. I replaced it, and also purhcased a new one for a family member as a gift. These new models are now made in China (do not think that this is a European made unit !). Unfortunately, the water level indicator is designed so that one pours in water, bubbles almost always occur in the column, making the water level inaccurate. My family member has noted the same thing. Upon contacting Krups, they admitted this design problem and offer to repair the problem, IF we ship the unit to a repair shop in Little Rock Arkansas. Even if you just walked out of the store with unit with a known. Unfortunately, this epidode has ruined my trust in Krups as a brand. We will throw away the unit and go with hopefully a more forthright brand name."
2,Carafe Drips,"This was such a highly recommended coffeemaker - I was surprised to find that the carafe can't pour a decent cup of coffee. It drips all over your countertop or tablecloth, making a huge mess. The coffee brews up just fine - but if Krups doesn't redesign the carafe and offer replacement models, I'm going to be forced to buy another coffeemaker."
2,NOT worth the $50!!!,"I purchased this machine because of Krups good reputation.The unit makes a fast, nice, hot cup of coffee...but so does a $[...] Black and Decker! The outside water level indicator is VERY inaccurate; filling the reservoir to the ""4"" cup mark yield a bit over 3 cups of coffee!?!?!? In addition, the indicator gets air bubbles in it (probably from the inside water filter) making it completely useless. The carafe is THIN and the fact the the handle is glued on frankly scares me (see prior reviewer whose handle FELL off of a FULL pot of coffee). The unit in general does not give the feel of a very well made machine.After one week...back it goes. Look at the Cuisinart DCC-1200. Well made, good carafe with plastic lip. WORTH the [...] bucks"
2,Poor electronics,"Coffee maker works fine when it works, but if it is sitting on a wet counter or someone pours poorly so that water misses the reservoir and spills on the machine, the electronics can get ruined. This happened after 1.5 years for our first one, and less than one year for the second. Then the display just blinks and none of the controls work. Bad design."
1,krups coffee pot,Have purchased Krups coffee pots in the past and they were great. My new coffee pot cover leaks every time you pour a cup! And it is not just a few drops - you need to sponge up an be careful not to burn yourself. And the customer service is very poor. A pleasant women would make sure that my complaint was passed on. There was no customer recourse. Just live with a defective pot and waste very expensive coffee I guess.
1,Poor choice,"I have usually bought a more expensive brand, which has given us trouble, and which we thought wasn't worth the additional money. I was wrong. The carafe trickeld out the spout and made a mess, no matter how we tried to pour it. The coffee was weak, even when we put more coffee than usual into it. This was not worth the $30 I tried to save, even if the alternative brand I purchased in the past only lasted 2 years. I returned this and bought another Cuisinart, which does not have these flaws. I'd rather take a chance on a coffee maker lasting only 2 years than spend money on something that's worse straight out of the box."
1,KRUPS FME 214,"This one only lasted 2 years, what a waste of money. We have a 50 year old, made in America one that we plug in when the new one dies. Seems to be no reason to make a quality product when we are forced to buy more."
2,can't believe this is German Engineered,"first - this coffee maker brews very fast but that is the only thing I like about it.second-The gauge is on the wrong side for me, I'm right handed- go figure.third- the gauge often develops bubbles and it is hard to determine how many cups are there.fourth and the worst feature- the maker doesan't brew thw number of cups indicated on the gauge. it is always less than indicated so it is a big guess how much coffee is actually going to be brewed.Am replacing this with a Cuisanart."
3,Not as good as the previous Pro model,"First and foremost this product makes excellent coffee.But (there's always a but isn't there) the water feed usually creates bubbles in the watermeasure tube and is difficult to fix each time...the Programming control does not have a manual override; it is supposed to not go on if there is no water in the coffeemaker but sometimes it cuts on at the scheduled time even if the water has not been loaded in it...It is better, and safer, to unprogram it if you do not intend for it to go on at the scheduled time."
3,They should have left it alone,"My first Krups lasted 14 years. You turned it on, it made coffee. Another review complained that it is too over complicated, now that I have it I have to agree.My big beef with it? The water measure tube on the side gets air locked and filled with bubbles constantly. It is nearly useless.Spring loaded coffee filter door... big pain.Rubber feet... way too sticky. Must use two hands to move it on the counter.Loved my first one, doubt if I will ever feel the same about this one."
1,REASON FOR RETURN,"I PURCHASED THIS COFFEE POT AS A REPLACEMENT FOR MY VERY OLD ONE THAT HAD WORN OUT. HOWEVER, NO MATTER WHAT FILTER I USE ETC. I CANNOT GET A STRONG CUP OF COFFEE WITH IT. I HAVE RETURNED IT FOR A CREDIT. I HAD RESEARCHED ONLINE FOR SOME TIME BEFORE PURCHASING THIS COFFEE POT AND IT HAS BEEN A DISSAPOINTMENT TO ME.I HOPE THIS WAS JUST A BAD TURN OUT AND THAT THE OTHER KRUP COFFEE POTS ARE DOING BETTER.SINCERLYPHYLLIS MANN"
1,Not the Krups quality I once knew.,"Our last Krups coffee maker finally gave up after 15 years. We liked it so much we thought we would order another - what a mistake! This coffee maker is the most temperamental machine I have ever known.- The electronics keep indicating no water even though it is full.- The electronics freak out weekly (flashing rapidly between screens). I usually need to turn it off and wait a day.- The handle separated from the carafe after several months (not broke, just bad adhesive joint.)The coffee tasted good while it lasted. But at 14 months it gave up the ghost - the water sensor won't allow it to start.(My mother-in-law purchased the same model as my wife. Hers died after only 8 months - similar symptoms.) What happened to the Krups quality that we once knew?"
1,Very Poor Product - Don't buy,Horrible product. Carafe drips no matter how you attempt to pour. There's a little bell / beeper that drives us crazy. This thing wants to be cleaned too often. That's what the little bell is all about. We can't find a way to silence it. The unit has now started leaking. I wrote the company and they e-mailed back. Gave me info on a replacement carafe. Still trying to find out if they are suggesting that I purchase a replacement. That ain't gonna happen. Will never buy another one nor any of their other products.
1,Do not buy,I challenge anyone to pour a cup of coffee with this carafe wiwthout dripping all over the countertop. The programming user interface is impossibly complicated. Worse the coffee maker has a no water or low water senor that can not be reset. After three months I can' t use this coffee maker anymore because it won't turn on because of a bad sensor. Junk. Customer service no help.
3,No gold filter,I am not happy. I thought the coffee pot came with a gold filter. Bought it for a gift. Now I have to go buy a gold filter for it. He said it makes good coffee but has to use paper filter. I would have ordered a different brand it I would have known it did not have one. I have always had a Krup maker but it always came with one. Can someone tell me what size I have to buy.Judy
3,The good with the bad,"This is almost a great coffee maker. Fantastic carafe design, pour slow or pour very fast, its so much better than Mr C or some others I had in the last few years. Reliable with great tasting coffee at the right temperature. But the controls for programming and the display graphics are a horror. !!Warning!! don't lose the manual, keep it close for review every time you lose power or when some graphic starts flashing."
4,efficent,"A very good coffee maker.....efficent and reliable. The only complaint I have is once the time set for keeping the coffee hot expires (2hrs in my case), I cannot re-heat the coffee again. Because there is no new water going through the system, this coffee maker is programmed to go off almost immediately. However, I can set the timer to 3 or more hours. Otherwise, a nice machine."
4,Krups delivers more tasteful brew,"This coffee maker is pretty basic. The features of turning off after programable period is convenient. Have never set it to brew automatically. Reason for the purchase is that Krups brews coffee at a higher temperature and delivers more flavorful brew. Can't be matched by other similarly priced manufacturers. This unit is for my office and gets daily use. Not fond of the plastic body and basket holder, but it works smoothly enough. Would buy it again. (acutally I have another unit like this at home)Michael"
1,Plastic smell won't go away,"My 15 year old Krups made excellent coffee and gave up the ghost - apparently in the meantime, the company gave up too. The first one I bought, had a strong plastic smell and within 36 hours the clock/'on' indicator failed. A replacement works, but after 3 weeks, the plastic smell remains strong; even after repeated vinegar/water flushes and many, many water flushes. Krups said I could send it in (at my expense) for warranty service. That won't fix it - the only solution is the trash can and I'm now looking at other brands. I'm sorry to see such a previously fine company have a 'junk product'; but I'll never buy another one."
3,Good coffee but leaks,The coffee is good but the water level indicator leaked. I'd fill it with 12 cups in the evening to wake to coffee. In the morning I'd have 9 cups in the carafe and 3 cups of water on the counter. I expected better quality for the price.
1,Smells like burning plastic,"I've always had good luck with Krups products, but not so much this time. After two days of owning this coffee maker the handle on the carafe fell apart. The handle is apparently made of two molded pieces of plastic, and they have come apart. I had to glue them back together. I could live with that if it wasn't for the strong burning plastic odor this machine produces while brewing. It also imparts a ""plastic"" taste to the coffee. I thought this was my imagination until I did a little research and found several other reviewers complaining of the same problem.Oh, well. I should have read the reviews first. I've recently ordered a Cuisinart coffee maker to replace this one. I'm just going to throw the Krups away. The plastic smell and taste can't be healthy."
1,One Star is to high,"My first time with Krups Krap.Bought this in Nov 07 to replace a very old Braun. Wanted another Braun but they don't make it any more. After two months and experiencing all the problems others have written about (fill level gauge with bubbles, carafe dribbling regardless of how you pour) my FME2-14 just lets the water run through the bottom after you fill the tank. Fortunately I was still in the kitchen when it quit brewing and the water just started running all over the counter. Contacted Krups and lets just say, NO more Krups Krap in this Kastle!"
1,Adds Plastic Taste to Coffee,"This coffeemaker has to be carcinogenic. It adds a strong taste of plastic to the coffee. Most coffeemakers have plastic parts but they do not add a direct plastic taste to the coffee. Also, as the coffee brews, a distinct plastic aroma wafts from the coffeemaker into the room.I am amazed that Krups, a reputable firm, would not realize while evaluating this product, that the plastic was directly leaching into the liquid in the coffeemaker. It is not good if they poison their clientele.Do NOT buy this unless you like your coffee flavored with plastic resins."
4,pretty good for the price,"ever have a coffee pot that when you pour, the coffee runs downs the front of the pot and not into your cup? well this is one of them. i tried lifting the lid when i pour, pouring faster, pouring slower, all sorts of different methods. and it's not just me, everyone in my house seems to have trouble with it. other than that, ITS A GREAT COFFEE MAKER!"
4,close to excellent,"the only flaw is the design which attaches the lid to the pot.... very awkward to wash and sometimes clumsy to handle...otherwise , makes excellent coffee and does so with some boiling noise but really not enough to complain about...fs"
5,Best cup of coffee I've ever had.,"In the last 3 years I've been through Cuisinart, Melitta, and the new Mr. Coffee and they were all disappointing. This is my first Krups so I didnt know what to expect but WOW, WHAT COFFEE! I dont know how they do it, but this makes the best coffee I've ever had. I havent had a problem with drips or spills others have mentioned, and I dont fiddle with the controls, just turn it on and brew a full pot in around 3-4 minutes. Fantastic!"
2,bad electronics,I liked this coffee maker at first. It brewed quickly and made a good cup of coffee. Unfortunately after 3-4 months the electronic panel started acting funny and we were unable to turn the unit on or off. The time clock also stopped working and were unable to program the start time. In the end we had to unplug the machine because it would constantly turn itself on and off at random times. What good is a coffee maker when the unit will not turn on due to a faulty electronics panel? Guess it's time to find another coffee maker.
2,Multiple issues,"I have had Krups coffee makers before and have been very happy with them. I bought this one as a replacement for one that was old enough that when I broke the carafe I couldn't find a replacement. So, prior to this I have been very happy with them. However, this maker has had multiple problems. The programmable feature stopped working early on. Now the reminder beeps are stuck in the on mode. I wake up earlier than my husband and this drives him crazy. About a year into owning it, the outer part of the handle came loose. It reattaches, but frequently falls off in my hand and recently fell off in the dishwasher, hit the heating element and partially melted. Its newest problem (1 1/2 yr mark) is the basket door swinging open in the middle of brewing. I am on this site looking at reviews of other coffee maker brands since I am having so many problems with it that I have to replace it. On a positive note, I do like the quality of the coffee it makes."
2,"problems, problems, problems",I was given this coffee maker as a Christmas present and liked it right off. Made decent coffee and I really liked the fact that it would keep my coffee hot up to 5 hours however..... One week in and the water level indicator now has a bubble so I can't tell how much water to put in. I don't like using the pot to measure as it's always off. The carafe drips if you pour fast unless you lift the top of the carafe which I had to do with my old pot. I also don't like the #4 type filters they are very expensive when compared to the basket filters. All in all the coffee maker is being returned and I'm back to my old Mr Coffee until I can find a replacement.
2,Back to the drawing board,"I've been using Krups coffeemakers for over 20 years, this being the fourth I've purchased. It may also be the last.Programming the device is moderately frustrating, with less than clear directions. The water gauge is badly placed and too narrow - bubbles form in the gauge making it useless as a measure. The attached lid on the carafe makes it harder to clean. That it took three weeks of use before the smell of new, wet plastic infusing the coffee subsided also makes me wonder what has happened to the quality I'd come to expect.Krups seems to have decided to let appearance trump function, resulting in a machine that looks better than it works. Unlike its predecessors, I expect I'll be replacing this machine before it quits working."
1,Krups Is Disappointing,"I am one of those folks that use to have a Krups Pro Aroma 453. In fact, it sits lifeless in my home still. All it needs is a new thermal switch, but I can't find one anywhere. The 453 machine made perfect coffee. I expected the newer Krups models to make the same quality of coffee, but I was so wrong. I got the model pictured above 2 years ago, and it still makes coffee that smells/tastes like burning plastic. I've resorted to boiling water in a cup & pouring it manually into the filter compartment. DO NOT buy one of these! I have a different maker's pot on the way, and am sad I have to go thru the laborious task of finding a coffee maker that can do what seems like the impossible: heat the water correctly before dumping it on the grounds. Tomorrow when the new one arrives I'm gonna throw this sucker into the trash. So that's what I think about Krups FME2-14 coffee maker."
5,"Krups FME2-14 12-Cup Coffeemaker with Glass Carafe, Black","WE BOUGHT THIS EXACT COFFEEMAKER A YEAR AGO AND MY HUSBAND AND I LIKE IT SO MUCH WE ARE BUYING ANOTHER ONE IN CASE THIS ONE SHOULD EVER BRAKE. IT WORKS JUST FINE NOW, NO PROBLEMS SO FAR. THE FEATURES WE LIKE ARE IT IS VERY EASY TO USE. NOT A LOT OF BELLS AND WHISTLES BUT JUST WHAT WE NEED. THERE IS ONLY ONE BUTTON TO TURN IT ON. THE COFFEE BREWS THEN IT BEEPS AND TELLS US IT'S READY. ALSO IF SOMEONE FORGETS TO SHUT IT OFF BEFORE LEAVING FOR WORK IT EVENTUALLY TURNS OFF AUTOMATICALLY. AND BEST OF ALL IT MAKES GOOD COFFEE. WHAT A DEAL!WE BOUGHT THIS COFFEEMAKER FROM AMAZON.COM IT WAS A GOOD PRICE PLUS WE RECEIVED THE SUPER SAVER DISCOUNT WHICH MEANS NO SHIPPING AND HANDLING CHARGES."
3,Krups coffee maker,"This is a good coffee maker, and the vendor sent it right away. The only issue I have is with the quality of the caraffe. It is very fragile and tends to chip at the pour spout. I suggest you buy a second caraffe if you purchase this item."
3,some problems,"It makes decent coffee, but the problem of air bubbles in the water level measure that others have mentioned is a real one. We now have such a big air bubble in ours that the water level indicator on the unit is worthless."
3,Not bad for the price,We have owed Krups before and are coming from a very disappointing experience with a Cuisinart coffee maker.The Krups makes good coffee. Our only complaint is that it is very easy for air bubbles to collect in the water level gauge. This makes it very hard to tell how much water you have put in.
5,Krups quality does it again.,Works great! Brews quickly. Design is compact and stream lined. Love it!
3,Is coffee worth this?,"The coffee maker looks great, and the flavor is good. However, be careful when filling the water reservoir - it's hard to see the overflow hole in the back, and you won't necessarily know you've put in too much until it is all over your countertop. During the brew cycle, you'll notice water dripping down onto the hotplate, by the sizzling and popping noises. You may be able to figure out where the water was dripping from, but we couldn't.The filter is somewhat of a joke - it pops out of its place regularly, and the hard plastic cover really covers the filter well - not sure that the water is being adequately filtered. All-in-all, good coffee, but watch out for the quirks, and try not to pay too much for this (i.e. anything over 35=40 dollars)."
4,Don't know why this keeps happening,"The coffee maker makes good hot coffee; however, I am not pleased with the fact that one of the little rollers on the bottom of the holder to move it keeps coming off and this is very annoying."
3,krups coffee maker,"It is awkward to use, very confusing and involved directions, you must shut off the auto feature, when not using it, as opposed to putting it on , and always having it be off intstead, it looks good and makes good coffee, but it is not simple to use and set up the clock and timer."
1,Poor Substitute for Braun,"I bought this coffee maker about 8 months ago, and had difficulty from the beginning. It was difficult to program - couldn't get the program for automatic brewing set, and then couldn't figure out how to turn it off, forcing me to unplug and cancel all programming. It leaked small amounts of water from the outset, and several times got into the clock/programming area. Recently, the water had apparently gotten into the program again, and all displays began flashing, and the coffee maker just shut down. I had a Braun Aroma Select which worked perfectly for 9 years before it finally gave out. I would never buy Krups again."
4,"Great, until I noticed the mold","So, it could be me. i have had this coffee pot for at least 5 years but today i noticed some mold in the little gauge accessory on the left of the machine that indicates how many cups of water you have in the pot.i am going to try the acid rinse but it looks like it is well established and i would be surprised if it came loose.This is a lesson in coffee pot maintenance."
1,Just awful,"Bought this to replace a Braun that died. Nothing works right--it overflowed until I took the filter out, coffee not hot, turns itself off and if it does you can't get it to warm the pot again. Hard to program, not intuitive, fussy about the grind of the coffee. I have this in the garage and have ordered another Braun."
3,A Rose is Still A Rose,"The single is good if you are an Aretha fan; which interestingly, I am not. My disappointment is that this re-mix single of five versions does not include the original version, which is the only one that I was interested in and really enjoyed hearing on the radio enough to want the single, while not being a fan. There is a instrumental that I did enjoy a lot, though.Again, if you love Aretha - you will love this 5 version re-mix.-cornelia"
2,Didn't work for me,"I got these while pregnant after my midwife recommended them to me. Unfortunately, they did not work for me. In their defense I had some pretty EPIC heartburn while pregnant (didn't matter what I ate....I could have had bread and water the whole time), it pretty much felt like the fires of hell had set up camp in my stomach with some pretty rowdy parties in my esophagus (even a prescription from the doc never cured the heartburn). Luckily 2 months after my order my little girl was born and TADA, goodbye heartburn. So, maybe this would work if you just had mild heartburn?"
4,WRITTEN BY A FELLOW COMBAT VETERAN,"THIS AUTHOR WAS IN MY PLATOON AND WE WENT THROUGH HELL TOGETHER. HE IN TURN HAS READ MY MEMOIRS. EVERYONE SAYS i SHOULD PUBLISH AS I A HAVE A GUARANTEED BEST SELLER. TYPE HAS BEEN SET, PAGINATED AND IS CAMERA READY. i JUST DON'T HAVE THE WHEREWITHALL. ."
2,cute but could have been made better for price,I bought this for my son's room and thought it was a very cute idea. For the price I paid for it I think it should have been a little sturdier. It is cheaply made and all you are paying for is the Texans logo. How ever with some wood glue and brads my husband was able to reinforce it a little better.
4,It's missing a few excellent tracks,"I have to agree with the previous review. It doesn't include alot of there other good tunes. 2 of my favorite Manowar tracks are Defender and Carry on. I'm suprised that Carry on as well as Wheels of Fire aren't on here. I recommend doing what I have done. I have all of there albums plus some rare singles that I found at some used record stores and pawn shops. The only song I don't have on here is the German version of Heart of Steel. I just don't understand why they aren't more popular in the United States. The closest they ever came to me was in one of the Chicago suburbs, and they didn't get alot advertising out. I didn't find out until 3 months afterwards. Also I've noticed that until Louder Than Hell, there studio albums weren't recorded very loud. I have to turn the volume up a little more, especially on Fighting The World and Kings of Metal."
5,Groundbreaking aesthetic critique of a cinematographic element,This brilliant historical survey of the aesthetic uses of great depth of field cinematography is a groundbreaking study that marries a technological effect with a critical and historical perspective. There is no other book that takes this useful approach that applies to film-makers and critics alike.
5,Nice vacuum sealer,"The motor is powerful enough to suck enough air out of the bag so your food stays fresh. I like the manual buttons, so I can choose how much air I want out of the bag. The product is made in Italy. Most other vacuum sealers are made in China."
4,Mick Collins and the founding of the Irish Free State.,"Ireland's independence has a lot to do with Michael Collins. It was him that led the independence struggle as some of his ideologue brothers spent time in American thinking of an Irish Republic. Mick Collins led the independence struggle while much of the IRA was either in exile or prison. He did so at great risk to himself. When the British wanted to negotiate, it was Mick who was the lead diplomat. He got the best deal he could from the British and then was opposed by the same ideolgues who spent their struggle in prison or America. This led to the Irish Civil War between Republicans and Free Staters. The capstone of the Civil War was when Mick was assasinated.This is not a complete biography of Michael Collins. If one desires a lengthy biography, please read Coogan's book. However this book provides a measure of the man. A good read."
1,"A fawning portrayal from a fan, not a historian","Sadly, Frank O'Connor seems to have been more of an idolizer of Collins than an historian interested in focusing the reader on the important events of his life. One has to wade through multiple tepid apologies for his occasional boorishness, though O'Connor seems to find these stories irresistably cute and keeps going back to him again and again. It may be that the book is best suited to those who have read extensively the other biographers and historians so that this could be understood in context. The Big Fellow is not for the novice Irish history student, because you learn precious little from it and have to work hard to get that."
5,Beastly fun,"Martha Barnette is the best. Few others can enliven dry and obsure facts and information like she can - all her books about words should be required reading for anyone with any aspiration of becoming a writer. And she serves up way more than fodder for cocktail chatter. After reading her, you'll find yourself thinking differently about all the words around you.Check out her website... for a preview."
4,fun with words!,"A good dictionary of words that have their origins in anything to do with animals...this book is an easy and quick read for word lovers. It explains the origins of many words we use everyday, in an interesting, lucid manner. This collection also includes many names of people and flowers that are derived from animals.This book would be even better if each word had a pronunciation guide, and if its usage was made clear with an example sentence. But this is a minor point as these two factors are well covered in the author's excellent website 'funwords.com'.Another great point about this book is that it features a list of books and recommended websites for word lovers."
3,A nice mobile,"This mobile is nice but it's not that great. It spins around. It hangs from the ceiling. What more did I expect? My baby seems moderately interested in it (9 mos old). It came in a large and elaborate box -- more packaging that I would have liked. Other than that, I don't have any real complaints."
5,love it!,this mobile looks even better in person. it is made of quality materials & it shows. i looked all over for a mobile that just made sense to me. by that i mean a mobile where the objects/characters are facing my baby & not me. this one has happy smiling faces for my baby girl to look up at. if youre thinking about getting this mobile go for it!
3,a little disappointed,"I red all the great reviews here before I purchased it, but after hanging it up, one side hang lower than the other. The string it hangs on is a little short. I understand that it's not suppose to hang to far down, but now it is so far away from my babies eyes that it's hard for her to see it clear.... otherwise it's pretty cute though"
1,Cheap Imatation,"Extremely poor I want a refund...poor quality, hardly can make out thier faces and the music doesn't even follow his mouth...looks like someone downloaded it off the internet. The picture on the dvd itself is cheap crappy paper. It won't even play correctly. I am really dissapointed the someone would make this just to profit off of his death. Don't know how they can live with themselves. I don't reccommend anyone else buying this,[...]"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,I purchased this product and buyer beware!!! This looks like it was done by a child. Do not waste your time!!
1,Wack......don't even think about copin.,"Terrible....straight up garbage. Too much of an avarage joe. Alright beats but his flow doesn't even match the instrumentals. His flow sounds exactly like an old school west coast style in which he is from the east. You will regret it if you buy this album. I myself, as soon as I get up from this couch, I'm throwing this CD right in the trash."
3,Very very basic,"If you know ANYTHING about fishing, you really don't need to bother with this book. There's nothing wrong with it exactly, it's just very simple. I did learn a thing or two, but considering the size of the book, it wasn't worth it. A good gift for a son or daughter perhaps."
1,Incredibly bad,"I have several of Mr. Thompson's cd's which I like, but this one is really bad. Imagine listening to relaxing music, but some kid is at your stereo playing with the balance control, making everything go all in your left ear, then all in your right ear, then back and forth randomly. After 10 minutes I couldn't take it anymore. Someone else might find that relaxing, but I most certainly did not."
4,Great Holiday Film,"Jumping Up and Down is a great independent film. I enjoyed the film as well as respect the fact that it was produced in 72 hours. There are some production errors, but in terms of a low-budget film, they are not that noticeable. Overall I'd give the film an 8 or 9 out of 10. It's a good Christmas movie with some funny adolescent humor but they've also got a nice story-line in there as well."
2,"ok, not great",Poorly recorded mono-ish surf tunes. The tunes are largely simple riffs with key changes. Throw in a few whammy bends & there's your tune.
5,My first game,"This was my first game for the psp, and I am loving it. The controls are great, but the hero controls leave a little to be be desired. I love the space fights, and if they would let you attack every system from the inside it would have been perfect. This game is great,and I would recommend it to anyone. I am an experienced gamer, in case you care."
4,Better Than Battlefront 2,"I'm not saying I'm an expert on Battlefront 2, but this game just feels right when compared to its predecessor. The graphics look a little better. Movement is smooth and fluid. Flying missions are a lot of fun. Voice acting is pretty good. The cut scenes aren't anything to write home about as they are merely photos set to music and dialogue. However, you do get to customize your character. You can also earn credits to purchase lots of different weapons. I haven't tried the multiplayer yet. I think if you are a Star Wars fan you probably can't go wrong with purchasing this game."
3,fun but short,This game is really fun but extremely short i was able to finish the single player in a couple of hours. The multiplayer susposedely is really fun but i dont know since this game is old and you cant find people online. I bought it for a road trip but ended up beating the single player before it started because o thought it would be longer.
4,Fun Game - Recommended,"""Star Wars Battlefront: Renegade Squadron"" is nothing short of a great PSP game. The graphics, music, and game play are all way above average for games on portable systems. The missions are fun and the new customizing options give the player a lot of flexibility when developing their characters.My only compliant is that the game was fairly short and can be completed in one session. The game can be replayed and supports multi-player modes, which adds to the enjoyability.Recommended!CFH"
4,Best One Yet,"I bought this game soon after playing it as a rental - I really enjoyed it. You can customize your player with colors, bodies, and heads. You can also choose your own weapons and other gadgets. I enjoyed playing the infastructure mode; I am surprised it was not included in the second Battlefront game. I was surprised at how many worlds there were to play in - far more than Battlefront 2. When playing Instant Action, you can now play Hero Capture the flag. The controls took some getting used to, but now that I have them down I like them more than the originals."
1,"Lucasarts should use their time for BFIII for 360, not waste it on this ****","This is a pure waste of money. The fact that the analog stick is on the same side as the d-pad is dooming for the psp. Lock-on replacing looking up down left and right is stupid. Yes, the customization is cool, but I was expecting an at least DECENT game. Lucasarts, Battlefronts 1 & 2 are amazing. This, however, is a sham. SHAME ON YOU LUCASARTS, USE YOUR TIME FOR BATTLEFRONT 3 OR FORCE UNLEASHED FOR XBOX 360 RATHER THAN THIS ****."
4,Great Laptop with some tweaking!,"The laptop was initially a bit slow, but after some adjustments like removing crappy Norton Anti Virus, disabling the defragmenting every time the laptop was turned on etc it was better. After a ram upgrade it was much much better! i would say you absolutely need at least 2 Gigs of RAM, it's a night and day difference. The wirless works perfectly, connects instantly, much faster than my Dell Latitude D620. Value for money is very high with all teh goodies you get. Battery life is only average though. Overall I am very happy with the laptop. If only it had XP professional instead of Vista Business!"
4,Inside East Germany,"Very interesting and disturbing look at post-war communist Germany. He's a college student who visits East Germany to see how it's working or not working. He is saddled with a ""companion"" who he suspects is of the secret police. Very thought-provoking. I recommend it."
1,Do the Manufacturers Actually Have Any Cats?,"I'm not sure how this product can be as bad as it is. When the litter we were happily using (Field Fresh) stopped being manufactured, we tried this. It smells okay until a cat actually uses it. Then the smell gets progressively worse over the next day. Their claim that it eliminates odors is ridiculous. I even tried scooping it every day (which they say you don't have to do) but it made almost no difference. The cat urine soaks into the flaky bark material, and just makes big wet clumps that reek. The only way it ""works"" is to completely dump it 2X per day. Not exactly cost effective! Go with something else (we found Feline Pine to be okay but our cats didn't like it; the corn husk or corn cob stuff seems to work well, and our cats like the texture more -- so we'll look for something else like it)."
3,Their Other Books are Better,"I own every Trinny and Susannah book written. So when I saw used book dealers asking $100.00-plus for this out-of-print book I gasped. I finally found a reasonably priced copy on EBay.This book is out of print for a reason. Even some of T&S; rules have changed since this book was published. So don't pay the outragious amounts used book sellers are asking and simply buy T&S;'s What You Wear Can Change Your Life and What Not To Wear titles.They have the same, more updated info as this book plus more.Happy shopping!"
5,How to hide your worst parts!,"I saw this book in a London store in October and thought it was fantastic. It is based on an English TV show called ""What Not To Wear"". The show has just begun being aired on the cable network BBC America.The book's pictures show the do's and don'ts of dressing to your appropiate body type. The authors poke as much fun at themselves as they do other people and it makes great fun to read and share with other women, especially over a bottle of wine.It is the ultimate ""Glamour Do's and Don'ts"" book but alot more fun."
2,"superb Starker, rotten remastering","These performances of the Bach Suites were wonderful on LP. Unfortunately, whoever was in charge of making the transfer of these recordings on to CD botched horribly and made the entire set sound a half step sharp. For those of us who have listened to and played these works for years, hearing this (eg. Suite No. 1 in G-sharp major!) is most disconcerting.I was so shocked when I first put the CD on I had to run to a friend's house, who still had the LPs, just to see if I had somehow remembered the original sound wrong. No, the LPs were fine, Suite No. 1 is in G major and so on.Starker's new set, on RCA, is wonderful, so perhaps it doesn't matter, but it is still distressing to hear this happen. Why? Why? Why?"
3,"Overrated. Stick with Casals, Fornier, Isserlis, and Bylsma","The recordings of these classics by Casals (the Naxos remastering of the same recordings is much better than EMI Great Recordings), Fornier (DG and EMI Icon are different recordings but both are very good), Isserlis (2007 recordings and perhaps the best of all), and Bylsma (played on a 1701 ""Servais"" Stradivarius Violoncello on loan from the Smithsonian with a wonderful melo sound) are much better."
3,5 star music hindered by 2 star playing,"I love Suzanne Ciani's music. Her compositions are wonderful. Saddly her piano playing does not do them justice. I have listened to this album many, many times, thinking that I was being to harsh in my judgment, but I always arrive at the same conclusion. Suzanne bangs the keys. Sometimes she bangs them softly. Mostly she bangs them loudly. She plays the correct notes at the correct time, but there is no art. All of the finer points of playing are missing. I much prefer ""Dream Suite"", ""Turning"" and ""Suzannne Live"" in which she can bang to her heart's content, since most of the melody is carried by other instruments. Maybe someday a gifted piano player will do these compositions justice."
4,It does the job,This winch has worked the way that I hope it would. I liked the easy way that a remote control was installed. I had an older model Superwinch and the remote for that winch was a problem to install. Controls on this winch were much more user friendly.
1,"not by the original artists, bad bad covers!!!","this cd is a collection of covers by karaoke singers, something that isnt mentioned in the description. the singers are mediocre, don't buy this."
1,Absolutely the lowest,"If there was a negative star rating I would use it. It doesn't even deserve a star. I thought the CD was filled with songs by the original signers. Nope - these signers would immediately get the ""boot"" in the American Idol contest in less than two seconds. I wish I could get my money back on this purchase but no luck."
5,space saver,A great sppace saver. My new hobby is baking cookies and having space to cool all the varieties is limited. The cooling rack is a great solution to the problem. I plan to buy more from this seller and would recommend him to my friends.
2,Do NOT stack these racks!,"Initially I bought these racks and the idea seemed brilliant. No counter space for your cookies? Just stack them up. Well, I've had them collapse on me three or four of the half dozen times I've tried to stack them. The racks have little feet on the four corners that are supposed to set into the rack beneath them. In my experience, only three of the four feet actually set properly into one another. It's the feet that I blame for the collapse. Sometimes the cookies are cooled enough and the collapse doesn't do much damage, but usually several are banged up pretty badly and others slide to the floor (and then they're really dead!). If you are desperate for space and feeling brave, try it out, but if you're working on 'special' cookies for an event, etc, don't trust them.Overall they are easy to clean and only slightly thicker than normal racks to store. However, since the whole point of purchasing the racks was for their stacking ability, I only give them two stars."
2,Rusty already,"These racks are a good idea, poorly executed. They're a little flimsy and tricky to set up, particularly if you're holding a tray of cookies in one hand and trying to set up another rack on top of the first. The racks are quite small so you need more than one for a typical baking sheet. They've also started to rust already around the hinge area and I've only used them about half a dozen times. Short of breaking out the hair dryer it's just not possible to get that area totally dry."
2,What a disappointment,"What a disappointment! I had a set of these for many years - still going strong - but I needed a 2nd set - It is NOT the same. Same dimensions but each rack is 8.2 oz less metal then the originals. The originals were strong and unbending, these are not rigid at all. I was sorry to see how much Wilton had cheapened the product."
3,Nice Rack,"These are good quality cooling racks. Feel a little flimsy, but it folds down well and doesn't take too much space."
3,"great design, but poorly made","I have had this product for approximately 4 months now and it is already broken. The wires on the racks are poorly welded, and have rusted off in the corners of two of my racks. The racks have only been used a few times and were wiped down with a damp cloth after use. The design is good, as I am able to cool a lot of items in a small space, but the quality is poor."
4,It does its job even though it feels flimsy,"I live in an apartment and don't have enough counter space so I was happy to buy these stackable cooling racks. When I stack them up, they feel flimsy, like they won't hold up heavy stuff like pies. However, it makes sense to put heavier baked goods like pie on the bottom rack and lighter stuff on top. So far, no problems. It works great. It's easy to stack up, easy to clean, and easy to put away. It doesn't take up much space when you stack them up or when you them away in the cabinet. I'm satisfied with this product and would recommend it. BTW, the only reason I took away 1 star is because I wish it would FEEL sturdy. To the touch it doesn't feel sturdy, but it holds up your baked goods well. Overall, it's been a good product to me and haven't had a problem with it. I've owned it since FEB 2011."
4,Works well,"I received these for a Christmas present last year, and only started using them now; I bake tons of cookies for Christmas tins, and I was getting tired of having only one cooling rack. It's as advertised, and it works well, but be aware you have to play around a bit to get them to stack, and one was bent down in the middle. Still, they work for me and they've already been useful with my one batch of cookies that has made loads of cookies! I do like that the tiers fold down, so they will fit in the drawer I want them in."
4,They do what they are meant for,"Don't expect high quality, fancy racks, but they do what they are meant for. You can stack them with no issues, and they hold tons of cookies or muffins. They seem not really stable at first, but once they have the weight of your cookies they are just fine. Easy to clean, too!"
4,Nice,My mother really liked this for her baking and it is well made. I would buy more if it was needed.
2,pampered chef ones are better,Flimsy - they tip over easily. But are easy to wash and store so that's a plus I guess ..
5,These are really handy!,"I bake a LOT of cookies. I use these constantly. And they are a life-saver. They are sturdy and stable. I place the cookies on them to cool, but I can also leave the cookies on them if they will be decorated with icing, or for half-dipped chocolate shortbreads and other cookies that get drippy decorations. I just put the stack of racks inside of a cookie baking sheet or place foil underneath it. They go into the dishwasher and come out sparkly clean and ready for more cookies. I have two sets and could not live without them."
4,very handy little item for the kitchen,I originally bought this just to dry my waffles on but now I use to dry dishes/ trays and other items as well. This is a very handy little item for the kitchen.
1,too wobbly,"Simply criteria for a cooling rack; stand up without wobbling. Failed on three counts - none of the three racks could stand straight.Also, some of the wires had come detached from each other.This one's getting returned.Not quite sure if the product just bends too easily, or if amazon packed it poorly (and it was bent in transit).Either way, don't get it here.Is that enough to warrant a 1 star review? Given how simple a tool a cooling rack is, I think so."
3,Not sure I am happy,"Like the three tier thing, but it is hard to get the cookies on the lower and middle rack. with out taking them apart. I had a grid type one before and since I like our cookies soft I didn't realize how much I would miss that until the cookies started breaking off and falling between the slots. We will see..."
5,hooray for cooling racks!,"Very happy with this. I can cool all my cookies at the same time without them getting crowded, the stacking takes up less counter space, and the fact that they're collapsible makes them easy to store. They're also easy to clean. Now I feel like a real baker."
5,Perfect,This product arrived excellently packaged and safe for me in Australia. It is perfect.It is sturdy and I use it all the time. I tell my friends all the time where to purchase one. What a great idea.....
5,must have for bakers,"this cooling rack is amazing. the grates appear to be nonstick (nothing has stuck to them yet). they are easy to wipe clean in case you spill something on them. i have mine stacked on my bar and the bottom two tiers are collapsed with the top one standing upright. it saves space, and when i need all three tiers... i just lift it up and voila!its also pretty sturdy as i have mindlessly placed my 300+ pages baking book on top of it and it didn't collapse. its a great investment."
5,wilton racks,i enjoy baking cookies and find the stacked racks take up less space. The cookies did not stick to the racks. I highly recommend this product.
2,cookie rack,not very sturdy. Really needs a way to be locked to provide more stability for holding cookies. Had it fold up a few times.
5,perfect for a small space,"These were for my daughter who had limited space but loves to bake. It worked great for her, and now she won't need to take mine!"
3,"A little flimsy, but works as advertised","This is a little thinner than i would have wanted, and a little smaller than i would have wanted. I would have preferred if they were 1/2 sheet sized racks. And they're a pain to store. The legs make it hard to slide in and out of the cabinet where I vertically store my baking gear.But, they work as advertised. They stack nicely, and you don't lose any real estate on the trays when they stack."
5,Great for all kitchens!,"These cooling racks are a necessity in all kitchens! They are a staple in my home and I give them as gifts all the time.They help you save counter space as you have all your cookies cooling, which is so needed in small kitchens and still so nice even in more spacious kitchens!I have found it is a little tricky to move more than one rack at a time, but they are easy enough to move one at a time and re-stack... but rarely do I find I need to move them.These are great cooling racks, easy to clean and stack together when not being used for easy storage!"
4,Great racks,I liked these cooling racks very much and would have loved them if the legs had locked some way. The ability to stack them was a great space saver.
1,Lame,"This product is a good idea but the execution is very poor. The legs collapse for easy storage, but also collapse inadvertently while you are trying to do just about anything else. The crux of the problem is that you never assemble the three racks and then fill them. You assemble the bottom rack, fill it, and then try to stack the next one for filling. But usually you destroy some of the cookies (or whatever) in the process of stacking the next rack because of the aforementioned collapsing issues. Alas, they are not even very easy to store because they do not fold together, so between the three of them they are still very bulky.Also, I'm sick of everything being nonstick. Who needs a nonstick cookie rack? Maybe they could take some of the money they spent dipping this thing in Teflon and use it to come up with a better design."
4,Very good but needs smaller gaps between wires!,"Everyone else is spot on with these racks - they're excellent. It makes a huge different to be able to stack these up on your counter as opposed to laying out cooling racks everywhere. We filled up 2 of these (6 tiers in all) easily with holiday cookies and it doesn't take long to appreciate the stacking design.However, I just can't give it 5 stars because the wires are spaced too far apart for me. If you're looking for a cooling rack that has smaller spacing between wires (for small and delicate items), you'll want to keep on looking. These are great for 90% of baked items but if they had smaller gaps, they'd be perfect."
2,Wobbly and unstable,I thought this would be an ideal set of racks but I do think I will use them. Very difficult to stack and the spaces between the bars are too far apart. Very disapointed and would return except I do not know how to do that.
2,Neat idea poorly manufactured,Very low price but perhaps too low. The result is very low quality manufacturing. Some of the runners on the racks I received were welded on the frame underneath in a way that put tension on the runners so that they bowed out. This causes the powder coating (I assume that is what it is) to flake off at the peaks exposing the metal wire. I imagine that will not be as non-stick and will likely rust. Proper manufacturing would result in 4 or 5 stars. The racks are NOT heavy duty enough to withstand rough handling or very frequent baking (if you buy these for a commercial operation you will be disappointed). And you have to be really careful when stacking them.
2,You get what you pay for.,"I looked at different stackable cooling racks and didn't find a whole lot of options. This had good reviews and a cheap price, so I bought it. First of all, the size is TINY. When you allow room for the legs for the rack above, you can't even fit a dozen cookies on one rack. The metal is very flimsy, the bars are very wide and your cookies will fall through the bars if they aren't very firm already. I use these everyday and hate them everyday. Yes, these are cheap, but put the $10 toward a good solid grid style rack like Pampered Chef and you'll be happier in the long run."
2,don't waste your time and money,"Only after 1 wash it is already showing rust! Not nearly as high quality as they make it out to be, doesn't do well on softer cookies because of the wire, there is nothing ""Elite"" about these."
1,I sent it back....,This is (was) advertised as sturdy and reliable. It is not. It is shaky and loose. They do not stake very sturdily and there are very few crossbars like the set I purchased at Walmart for about the same price. I sent this set back and will be buying a second set with the crossbars going all the way across.
1,"Good idea, but rusty already?!","I received this and it was rusty out of the box! The black coating had chipped off in several of the corners and it was rusting. I would have asked for a replacement if it wasn't ALL three pieces, but I really don't think that just three pieces slipped past quality control, I think it's just a cheap product. I think this is a really good product idea but poorly implemented."
4,Good but a few things could make it better.,"These cooling racks get the job done but there are a couple of things I wish they could make better. When putting the racks away the legs like to swing around, it would be nice if the rack had legs that could lock so that the storage process would be easier. Also, I used these cooling racks for some candies that I made but they kept falling between the grids and onto my cookie sheet. It would be better if the metal grids were closer together so that things can't fall through.If you're using these racks for cookies, bars or non miniture items it works well. Its great that they are stackable because this does save space. For the price of $10 for three racks, I think its a great deal."
5,i love to bake,"These are coming in handy! I do dozens at a time, and these make it easier to cool, and keep counter space clear for other cooking!"
5,Stackable has its advantages,These racks are so easy to use I should have bought more and probably will later. Another set was bought for a friend and she loves how they stack. Very sturdy.
5,Cookie cooler,"These racks are very space saving items, to cool 3 cookie sheets at one time. Thanks for having these to be purchased."
5,Cookie cooling was a snap,I have only had single tier cookie cooling racks before that take up a lot of space on the counter and really didn't have enough room for air to circulate underneath. These free up counter space and are simple to stack and use or clean up and put away.
2,"Cooling rack, with issues.","The wires are spaced too far apart for baking cookies unless they're big ones, the stacking feature isn't very stable resulting in ruined baked goods.Bought this for my wife, a morning's worth of baking went tumbling, ruining the hershey's kiss cookies she was making. It takes a to make my wife cry, those cookies being ""ugly"" because of the malformed (but still delicious) hershey's kisses pressed into their tops did it. (Holiday stress contributed, I'm sure.)If you're making larger baked goods this should be fine, I wish I'd gotten her something else."
5,cooling rack,"very sturdy, large enough for bigger cake layers, quite pleased w/purchase. I order from Amazon frequently and rarely am I dissatisfied with my purchase"
5,Time to Bake with Limited Space,"This Wilton rack is typical for Wilton Products. Meets the needs, folds down to store, and provides that cooling area for limited space. I love it!"
2,misrepresentation of color,"I received the product very quickly. However, I was disappointed with the color, as all of my fixtures are oil rubbed bronze and are a shade darker than this Danze product. I will describe this Danze D490637RB lift and turn tub drain conversion kit as a copper color or a lighter shade of bronze. It is definitely not ""oil rubbed bronze"" as we know it to look i.e. a metal in a very dark shade of brown."
4,Wrong color,"The product looks like it's well made. However, the oil rubbed bronze finish is light. It has more of a copper appearance than the usual black oil rub with hints of bronze showing through. Amazon made the return easy!"
2,Would look nice if it wasnt scratched,"I purchased 3 of these and returned them all due to being scratched. They are packaged in a plastic clam-shell that rubs up against the actual metal parts, and because of this made circular scratches all over the cover and drain. There needs to be a protective foam or something to keep these parts protected. I am tired of buying and returning these, so I will look for something else."
3,Tub drain repair,I received the merchandise in a timely manner and unscratched. However the package was open at the bottom an the new screws were missing so I used the one from my old tub kit. A little disappointed since it was scratched looking on the gold head which sits in the middle of the overflow cap but only really gonna be noticed by me.
1,something is wrong here,"i have a two-hole style drain, but the previous owners of the house decided to fill in one of the holes with something that i couldnt even drill through. oh well, this thing came with a two-hole to one-hole adapter. that is pretty awesome of them. I installed the adapter so it would look normal. however, when i go to screw the single-hole drain trim on, the threads on the screws dont match the threads on the adapter. had to power through the aluminum with the steel bolt. it worked, but the bolt got messed up in the process. the threads on the bolt should really match the threads on the bracket. it doesnt make any sense."
5,It Be Da BOMB,"Yo homie, this album be all dat, and a big bag o' dem chips. Pun be SLAMMIN'. His Hip Hop lyrics be top notch material, yanamean? Pun, I love you man. You should be handin' out some lyrical skeeos with food stamps."
2,Soooooo dirty,"Although Big Pun may do it for some, his macho boasting about his sexual prowess gets old, especially considering his appearance."
1,Are you kidding?,"What has the rap world gone to? I am a big rap fan and I own like, Snoop Dogg, Method Man, Master P, Dr. Dre, etc., and this is just terrible. I own this cd. It sucks. That's just the way it is. The only good songs on there are Beware, Still not a Player, and Punish Me. The rest is just ... trash. I don't like it one bit. Don't buy it."
2,BIG PUN little album,"It really upsets me. This album has one great track, a few decent tracks (collaboration w/Wyclef), and that's about it. What upsets me is that BIG PUN is a talented lyricist, now only if he was given some good beats.My advice: Get the single and wait for his next album."
4,New Artist Lots of Potential,"His new release titled ""Still not a Player"" is the bomb. There are a few raunchy pieces (i.e. Taster's Choice) but the overall CD is OK."
3,Good cd. Could be better.,Big is here with his new album Capital Punishment. Dis a ok cd from Big Pun. When I listened to it it disapointed me. Big Ppun could do better.
5,PEEP THIS...,"If your a true Hip-Hop head peep the Feb 99 Source, Pun's article which starts on pg 154 is all you need to read to get you hyped about his album. With lyrics like: ""Dead in the middle of little Italy/little did we know that we riddled two middle men who didn't do diddily"" On his album you'll here more lyrics of great skill, just peep the HIP-HOP QUOTABLE DOPEST RHYME OF THE YEAR in the Source, of course PUN took that award (1st verse of ""Dream Shatterer"") This whole album is tight, and for that review I read from that other person from Boston, no disrespect meant but you should be kicked real hard in the back of your head for calling this album weak, enough said."
5,R.I.P to the greatest lyricist of all time,"Christopher Rios a.k.a Big Moon Dawg a.k.a Big Pun completely ripped this CD. His flow is ridiculous and in every song he delivers to you exploiting to the fullest extent of the language.A classic album from one of the greatest artists of all time, and easily the greatest lyricist of all time.Oh and to the idiot who gave it 1 star, stop listening to Chingy and 50 Cent and open your ears to some real Hip-Hop like this.Pick this one up! Well worth the money.R.I.P Big Punisher"
4,Pun at his best.,"Positives: Pun has an incredible style of flow and his lyrics rank with some of the best. The Latin element of his stuff gives the rap a little different spin. Better than his new album and has some good featured rappers on it. Best songs are ""Beware"", ""Glamour Life"", & ""Tres Leches"" with Prodigy and Inspectah Deck.Negatives: The songs like ""Punish Me"" are a little too soft for me. Leaving a track like this and a few others off the album would have made it a five-star album instead of four. Otherwise not many flaws."
2,"Big Pun romances, destroys","Big Punisher is a fascinating amalgamtion: he is at once a 450 pound man who romances the ladies, seducing them with his hot-tub antics. He is also a true gangster capable of hurting people (as he clearly demonstrates on the album.) If you like Hip-hop of the lowest common denominator- check out this album."
3,LMFAO at Chris,"OK, Chris, can't you realize that the Realrappa guy was a JOKE?!! Well, that was me, and guess what? I wanted to make a joke account, and I'm the same person as foolishmortal12! So, please, open up and lighten up there.Big Pun is good!"
1,Fatt and Worthless,"This is one of the weakest CD's I ever heard. How can this 450 pound fool say he got game. He also talks about crimes he done. You gotta be able to move to put in work. You don't need this CD, if you like that one song just get the single."
1,R.I.P,I dug Still Not a Player but the Music&the vibe didn't really hit home.but Pun was A Cool Cat.he deserved better Material than the stuff he got.Maybe given sometime down the Line His Stuff Might have Gotten Better but this Album&His Last One are Typical Industry Projects.He had some flow but the overall Feel goes Nowhere.
1,He SUCKS BALLS! He was too old & fat to live!,"No offense Pun, but you were just too fat and sucky that you got a heart attack & died! The only good soong on her is Twinz & that iznt even my type of rap song! Buy Yeeah Baby instead, it still sucks a little but ittl grow!"
5,Nice,"When I first bought this album back when it came out, I was not too crazy about it. I was too new to rap back then to really apreciate Big Pun's first LP. Now, as I am listening to this album while i'm writing this review, I realize why so many people regard Big pun as one of the greats. His flow is amazing and lyrically, in my opinion, is one of the top 5 greatest lyricists of all time. ""Beware"" is a great way to start off the album with the most incredible showing of his abilities to rap. Definitely a classic album."
5,picture perfect,"What can I say? Big Pun has taken the risk to take the game to the next level and he did it with so much effort, he should be regarded as one of the best rappers of all time. I like the way this guy flows, his enormous voice overpowers everything. His lyrics are spunky but dirty and ruthless, the reason he was the leader of the Terror Squad. To me, the best songs on here are Still Not a Player and Twinz (Deep Cover '98), you just need to listen to these two songs to experiment his love for rap music. I especially loved Twinz because it has got the mean, notorious beat from Dr. Dre's Deep Cover. It's straight off the street, designed to attack the po-lice in every way. His flow and rhymes in this is INCREDIBLE, hell I'd be so proud to make a rhyme like the one in this.""Dead in the middle of Little Italy, little did we know that we riddled some middlemen who didn't do diddely""- now that's a rap, it shows middlemen couldn't do diddely against this onslaught."
5,The Greatest Rapper and The Greatest Album Ever,This album proves that Pun is the greatest rapper ever even the skits are off da hook. Black people created rap/hip hop and Latinos perfected it. (LATINS GOING PLATNUM) HOLLA
5,STILL ADOLESCENT/GOT NUTTIN ON BIGGIE,"YOU GOT FLOW YO!BUT TRY FADIN ANY OF BIGGIE'S TRAX KNOW WHAT I'M SAYIN,KID? DOLO-MITE ""DEAD OR ALIVE"" LONG LIVE N O T O R I O S, KEEP REPRESENTIN PUN -YOU HIP BABY BOY- BEGONE;JB WIT DA REMEDY,'98"
5,BY FAR THE BEST BOOK ON THE TOPIC,"I am in my way to investigate about the characteristic of my Borderline Personality. This book is a ""must have"" when you are trying to understand the mechanisms that bring us always to mate narcissists and the sad dance that normally ends up in divorce when this two personalities get married. But more than that, it provides a very useful insight on the projection mechanism of borderlines in a couple with NPD. I would say that it is the only book around that I found related to this psychological topic. The very important question that remains after reading this interesting book is about the possibility that most infidelity cases in BPD/NPD couples may be due to projection mechanisms of the borderline on its mate in order to have him/her feeling guilty ..... and by the way more easily to be controlled."
2,Don't buy them for NEC 3500A,"They will burns at 4x in NEC ND3500A, ihave installed the last updated of the firmware and stills 4x."
3,Scanned Old Books,"The book The Lumbert Or Lombard Family leaves a lot to be desired. MANY of the pages are difficult to read accurately. Most of the pages are printed on the even side, not the odd side, as is normal. If you need it for Citations for a Genealogy - don't bother. I will keep it just because I have a photocopied original which is much better than this one. Very Disappointing."
2,Not great,I bought this for my 11-yr-old niece and she quickly discovered the holes in the beads were so small the thread wouldn't fit through several of them. So now I'm off to Michael's in search of some finer thread. Grrr!
2,Not great,"These are not original recordings! They are not bad for remakes, but understand these are not the real thing! I do like the selection, and for the money it's not bad. But if you're looking for the ""real deal"" on the songs, this is not it."
2,not original recordings,I was under the assumption these were the original recordings. Very disappointed!
4,100% satisfied,"The product came very fast, got what I ordered, was very happy with the whole process"
1,Stick With The Computer's Internal Speakers,"I didn't go into this purchase expecting much, just some cheap speakers that would be better than my computer's internal speakers. These speakers, however, are much worse.The only good thing about them is they are slightly louder. The sound quality is HORRIBLE very tinny sounding with almost zero bass, almost un-listenable. Also, there is some bad background static that creeps into the speakers. Again, I didn't have high expectations, but these may go in the garbage can.Either buy some nice speakers, or just stick with the internal ones, but don't waste your money on these."
3,"Sturdy and powerful, but vibration and run-out are problems","I love the power and the flexibility, but my work requires a precision which is impossible with this machine because of the vibration and the run-out variance (nearly 1/16 inch on my press). If this machine is to live up to expectations something must be done to dampen the belt vibration and to true the quill. JZK"
4,punkin hollow wood worker,"I have had this drill press for 11 years years and it has had many hard work-outs. I bought this as an upgrade to cut rosetts for the corners af all of the doors and windows in our house that I was doing all of the trim/molding on, 100+ of them and this drill press would not cut them. Plenty of power but way to much run-out I replaced the chuck and used a large clamp base to hold the rosettes,with no success. Other than that I love the drill press, but it does have a very poor quality chuck."
4,This is just the pattern book!,This book is meant to be an accompaniment to Mr. Winbeckler's airbrush instruction book!
1,Don't buy this product,"This product is not useful, no variety or creativity, he always would be good to show off some of the content or details of them. not recommend it."
5,An overlooked gem,"It is such a travesty that this album never garnered Pat greater acclaim and has been lost in virtual obscurity.Song choice: flawless.Vocal prowess: impeccable.Overall album: a cohesive, straight-ahead rock album with guts."
5,A truly must have!,"This album is out of print and is a rare find for anyone who is trying to find/add it to their collection. The album should have gotten more attention/acclaim, but was over shadowed by critics because of her earlier recordings were more of a ""rockin' edge"". Even today all of these songs still have a message/meaning. Just like they did when the LP was origionally released. This is definately a must have LP!"
5,Pat thanks for slapping the INSOMINA out of me!,"Ok folks, here we are. In a wasteland of musical indestion, this cd WIDE AWAKE IN DREAMLAND is a gem. It isn't just good, IT IS GREAT. I listened to it for few choice cuts first, but after much listening it grows on you. If your looking for something refreshing, rocking, this gem has alot of substance.ROCK-ON now ya here :)"
5,Definitely Wide awake for this one!,"This is perhaps her Best LP! very Strong material on this one!!! after a three yet wait, i was happy to see Miss Benatar return with this one!"
2,omni page pro 12 was better,omni page pro has compatibility problems with my ricoh scanner omni page pro 12 works just fine.
3,NEED HELP WITH OMNI PAGE PRO 10,"I have been using Omni Page Pro 10 here at my work. However, in the last few months, when I scan it takes forever for it to scan -- recognizing goes faster tho.I have removed all unnecesary programs from my computer thinking that I was using all my RAM. I am on a network.However, this hasn't solved my problem. I am now running Win XP and have ServicePack 2 installed. Could this be my problem? Can anyone help?Would like to get some input from others who have used Omni Page Pro 10 to get some ideas of what to try before I turn this over to our IT Department.Like ya'll, I really do like Omni Page Pro 10 -- but with the problem that I am having was wondering if I needed to upgrade Omni Page Pro 14 -- but considering what ya'll have said -- upgrading would give me a bigger nightmare.Please help if you can!!!"
2,Works great until you have a problem,"OmniPage 14 worked great at first. Then I needed a patch to fix some problems I'm having with the Batch Manager. Their update function under help is broken. (Look at other recent posts by other users.) I tried calling yesterday ($20) and couldn't get through.I'm well versed in fixing broken apps. After uninstalling/reinstalling, uninstalling/manually removing files and registry entries/reinstalling, I'm still having the same problems that are making it totally unusable. After searching Scansoft's website, and posting twice to their ""user forums"", I started looking for alternative solutions. I found more posts here than I did on Scansoft's site."
2,Like a demolition derby-- crashes galore,"It's bad enough that Omnipage Pro 14 Office crashes when you try to process a PDF file; bad enough that it crashes when you try to download an update from within the program (the only way ScanSoft allows you to do it)-- if there are solutions for these serious problems in their product, ScanSoft will not tell you about them unless you pay $9.95 per incident for e-mail support, $19.95 to actually speak to someone. What a lousy policy. What a crummy product!"
2,Beware of bugs and no free support,"Beware of this product. It is buggy - see eg the users group at http://webboard.scansoft.com/ - and there is no free support, even for program bugs. Scansoft's attitude to known bugs is illustrated by the fact that there is a bug in both versions 11 and 12 which prevents many users from updating the program but despite a large number of postings to this effect on Scansoft's own website already referred to and e-mail notification to ScanSoft the bug remains. Abby FineReader apparently offers free support and a scanner that users say is better, for example, for OCR scanning."
5,A classic classical album,"The Third is the most charming of Charles Ives' four ""official"" symphonies; one imagines the French would have been able to perform it - & loved it - during the 1920's. Subsequent research & a better sense of Ives' ""sound"" cannot be altogether discounted when listening to Hanson's committed 1959 performance; James Sinclair with the Northern Sinfonia on Naxos has a lighter & more deft touch that I believe is closer to what Ives heard in his head. But the inclusion of ""Three Places,"" William Schuman's ""New England Triptych,"" & the rugged Symphony no. 5 by the somewhat neglected Peter Mennin make this a classic classical album. Mercury's close mic ""Living Presence"" recording is better heard on speakers than through earphones, & was a sonic wonder of the era."
5,Great replacement,I got one of these to replace a Chauvet can the broke due to use. There wasn't much difference from the two except the Chauvet has a spring loaded clamp for the gel holder but the MBT does not. It shouldn't matter much because gravity works well. Well built can for the money.
3,Slow start not getting better,"I have to amend this review by saying that within a year the on button broke and it was such a disappointment. I hope this saves you some grief . DON'T BUY THIS GRINDER, IT IS A DUD! I really like this coffee grinder, but it took a while to get there. After reading the instruction booklet I followed the instructions to the letter. This resulted in the coffee grinder not working. It just sat there. After reading the directions again and going through the trouble shooting, it still did not work. Then with another try it did work. Just when I was ready to turn it in, it started working fine. It grinds the coffee just as you like it and without sounding like a weed blower in your kitchen. The only problem I have now is that sometimes I have to shake it to get all the beans to go through the grinder. It is a really fine grinder if you can get past the quirks."
5,This is the one I've been looking for,"This little machine is a honey. I've owned 3 other grinders before this and none of them come close. It's fast, it's easy, it's clean. It grinds to perfection. I have to give it a shake occasionally to get the beans flowing down into the burr, but it's no big deal. Highly recommended.The first one they sent me didn't work at all, but they sent a replacement immediately and paid for the shipping both ways."
3,For fresh coffee use a burr grinder,I got this grinder to use with a Bodium press I got at Amazon. I would like the grind to be a bit more course but it still works with the press. Perhaps this is because I only set the grinder for 3 cups for a 12 cup press. Any more coffee is just too strong. I guess my wife and I are just typical Americans. The grinder is not too noisy. There are times that I have to shake it to get the beans to start going again but to me this is not a big deal. The grind is consistent and the timer accurate.To save money what I do is buy beans in bulk at Costco or Sams and store the unused beans in a vacuum canister. I take out a weeks worth and re vacuum the rest. This way the beans stay fresh over time.
2,Quality takes a back seat,"I've owned this burr grinder for about a month and, if someone were to ask me if I would purchase it again, the answer would be a resounding NO! Sad to say I tossed the box, so I can't return it--but would, if I could. So I'm stuck with a product that I cannot depend upon. Here's why: The on/off button works sometimes, and sometimes not at all. The only way I can get it to operate each time is to either apply a lot of pressure (and I mean ""a lot"") on the switch, or to push real hard on the ground coffee container. Either way, it's always a pain. The ONLY reason I purchased this particular item was because of the generally great reviews it received from other buyers. My advice? Think twice about buying this one."
2,Problems,"The first one received stopped working after the first use. The motor fuse blew and can't be replaced. I sent it back and got another which worked OK, but grinds the beans too fine, even on coarse settings. I'll keep it, but am not happy with it."
3,What a Mess,"Even though the Krups GVX2 does grind coffee, no matter how you pull the ground coffee container out there is alway grounds falling on the counter. So we get clean up the mess for every pot of coffee. Yes it does grind well, and it didn't take to long to get it set for the strength we like. But the mess for every pot full really gets to be a pain."
3,its ok,"Have had one of these for almost 6 years (office) and one for about 5 years (home). Both are still working and grind coffee as well as they did on day one so the product is pretty durable. On both units the ""on"" button fell into the grinder after about a year and they have to be turned on using a pencil. The grind is consistent and the units are noisy enough (about what you would expect for a grinder) to annoy anyone sleeping.A safety catch (turns the unit off when you remove the receptacle) on the six year old one is dying so looking for a replacement. Haven't decided whether to get another one of these or the Capresso."
1,It broke with being used no more than a dozen times.,"The unit fails turn on after very occasional use, but just months after the warrantee period ended. I have quadruple checked that all the interlocks are satisified, but it just sits there uselessly. We have hardly used it because it doesn't grind expresso very well (it produces too much pulverized dust in with the finely ground expresso, which produces inferior expresso for drinks). Other than the $60 that has now been completely flushed down the toilet, its inferior performance means is not such a great loss. Do your self a favor, and buy something else."
4,Good grinder,"Good choice in a grinder. The burr grinder really does a better job than the blade type, and this particular one is relatively quiet. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because the on-off switch was defective on the first one I got and I had to exchange it."
1,Wrong color received,Everything was fine until my step daughter opened the package and found the item to be white. Since everything in her kitchen was black this was a catastrophy. I gave her the keys to my car and she went to four coffee shops and finally changed it for a black one. I don't want her to go through that again.George Butcher
4,Alzheimer's Disease: A Guide for Families and Caregivers,"I found this book to be very helpful and I bought it for everyone in my family. It has great information regarding patient behavior, caregiver experiences, suggestions for caregivers, and prevention of this disease. I would have given it 5 stars except for the information regarding being sexually loyal as a spouse of an Alzheimer's patient, and the chapter about assisted suicide. I believe adultery and suicide are morally wrong, and just because a person loses their ability to remember or know things doesn't make it right to engage in the above practices. They are still worth being loyal to and worth receiving loving care until they pass on. I believe to do less than that would bring remorse in the future and it would dishonor the loved one suffering from this disease."
4,AR AP801 Performance Series Power Cord,"I bought the AR AP801 Performance Series Power Cord with 14 gauge Oxygen free copper twisted conductors & noise trap as a cheap experiment to help eliminate any & all noise from my system. I am using it with a disk player that I am using as a transport & a Blu-Ray player. Digital devices are known to increase noise in AC lines. Power cords can significantly change the sound of a system. The greatest sound quality change I observed was when I changed the power cord to my Benchmark DAC1 D/A converter. It only draws 15watts, but a poor quality/18 guage cord ruined the low frequency response of the Benchmark. To clarify, I nvr used the AR cable with the DAC1. I observed no or minimal differences with the AR power cord on my Blu-Ray player. I am using a 1.92 kva isolator transformer to clean the power before the AR cable. Generally I think the AR Master series products are a great value."
4,Classic chills!,All your favorite creepy themes on one CD! I play this CD on a portable CD player hid in the bushes on Halloween and everyone loves it!
5,Works great with Mac Mini,"I have a wired Pilot Mouse on another computer and love it, but wanted to go wireless. I purchased the Pilot Mouse Mini rather than the Pilot Mouse because the former has an on/off switch, which I thought would address the complaints about the Pilot Mouse's power usage. So far I have not used it long enough to give a battery life estimate.Configuration with a Mac Mini was quick & painless. In terms of tracking & response, it's great for video/music editing but I haven't tried it with games. I have found if I don't do anything for a few minutes the first time I move the mouse there is a small lag but after that response is instant. The mouse does go to sleep if you don't use it for an extended period of time and it doesn't seem to automatically connect when you power-on, but holding down any button (I use the scroll wheel) for a few seconds will re-establish contact.So far - no complaints."
2,flakey - runs through batteries,"i have had this mose for about 6 months and have found it to be very inconsistent in connecting... it will be working fine for a few days then just quit. i can't get it to connect again... even when i put new batteries in it, it still has trouble connecting.it seems to run through batteries fairly quickly though this could be because i use my mouse often (i had to buy rechargable AA batteries and a charger). Batteries seem to last a little over a week which can become costly if you have to keep buying these AA batteries (you'll definitely want to spend some up front money on a charger).i hate to have to do this after spending so much money on this product, but i'm afraid i'm going to have to go out and purchase another blue tooth mouse. I just hope they all aren't this flakey."
4,I'm happy!,"It's just a good little mouse. Not a fan of a trackpad, and especially on my MacBook Air, this mouse is perfect. I can tote it to work easily, it's a perfect fit for my hand, and is a super match for my Air. My son recommended the brand name having had numerous Kenington products. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone."
4,Pilotmouse,"I really like the Kensington PilotMouse it is a good size (not too big, not too small) it works great with my Toshiba built in wireless receiver."
3,"Nice, but worth the price?","Nice features, on/off switch is nice. AA batteries last long. Sometimes not smooth tracking, though. Almost would be more practical paying less for a wired mouse that works smoothly."
3,mega mouse,"I wanted a small wireless mouse w/ a programmable key I could use to control a PPT presentation. This mouse is way too big to carry in one's pocket. Thus I returned it w/o opening the package. I don't know how well it worked: it's just mislabeled as a ""mini"" mouse"
2,not all that it could be,"The first mouse I received was simply defective, and needed replacing, which Kensington did after half a dozen email exchanges. The mouse was erratic from the start, would not stay on, and eventually would not go on at all. The replacement mouse is problem-free, and perfectly adequate, thus enabling a comparison between it and Apple's wireless ""mighty mouse"". The most obvious difference is in the action of the scroll wheel, which on the Kensington mouse is ratchet-like and clunky. The scroll wheel on the Apple mouse, in contrast, is a tiny little ball that operates as smooth as silk."
1,It Just Doesn't Work,"I read the good and bad reviews of this mouse and decided to take my chances. I should have listened to the folks who had trouble with the mouse. It moves the cursor on the screen very erratically. I made several attempts on two different computers, and it was completely unusable. I've returned the mouse to Amazon, and I truly hope that they will discard any remaining inventory of this item and never offer it again. (They might also consider testing the items that they offer for sale.)"
1,The mouse with Parkinson's disease,"For my PowerBook - my first bluetooth mouse (a macally bt) worked for about nine months and then a bad battery caused major leakage all over my desk. So for the replacement I read the reviews and went with the Kensington bluetooth mini - primarily for the on/off functionality.I like the size and shape, the on/off switch and the scroll works just keen. However, tracking is a nightmare - especially when CPU usage is high (applications like Photoshop, Acrobat or using a VPN to access my work files). I tried troubleshooting, adjusting the track rate, but nope. The cursor continues to stutter across the screen with this mouse.I think I'm going to throw in the towel and go back to wired."
4,Great little mouse,"Bought this so I'd always have a mouse available for my powerbook. Much more convenient than a USB mouse of any stripe. It was very easy to set up and I had it working in 3 minutes. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the software Kensington provides for OSX 10.X doesn't detect the mouse, even if OS X does."
2,Less than 15 months of use,"Got it at a great price. Liked it. Used it, didn't abuse it. But for whatever reason, it just stopped working - way too soon. Maybe I got the lemon, but I can't recommend it - wish I could - just like I wish this mouse lasted much longer before it failed!"
1,Not much for not much,"My first Mac in a long time (1980?). What better than to try out a BT mouse, a small one and handy for travel. Well, this mouse is just about worthless. Most of the time it doesn't connect for almost a minute. Sometimes it just drops off line and locks up. Then again, it doesn't cost much either. So, if you want something that works part time and you don't want to pay much for it, this is the mouse for you.I finally gave up and pulled the little mini-Logitech mouse from my old moribund Windows laptop. This is the cheaper of the small Logitech mice, but it still has that nifty and very small USB transmitter than you can leave in all the time. It works with Linux, Apple, Windows etc etc and it is much smoother to boot. Connects first time, every time and in a heartbeat. It costs more, but then so does a Lexus. It just works and keeps on working.Good luck."
2,"Poor Battery Life, Sluggish Performance","This would be a great little mouse except for 1. the battery life seems to be about a week or less and, 2. quality of the bluetooth connection seems to fade in and out."
1,Extremely disappointed,"I am highly disappointed with this device.It has a very annoying soft-power off if I don't interact with it for about 15 minutes. This power-saving feature is understandable and I can basically deal with it by a left click.But it gets worse from here. Sometimes the above procedure fails. You need to completely power-down (remove battery cover) and reset.For the past week or so it required that I comletely redo the bluetooth pairing/discovery process.Today it is impossible to detect the device. In less than a month, this mouse has completely failed.I'm returing it to where I got it. Based on other reviews I've read, I'm not the only person experiencing these types of problems. I'm not even interested in a replacement. I'll get a competing brand."
2,Pairing & Battery Issues,"I love this new mouse - when it works. Unfortunately you have to often go through the Pairing process as the Kensington Bluetooth system is much less automated than the USB mice we are all used to. It only takes a minute, but why is it necessary? Also the first set of double A batteries only lasted three weeks vs. 6 months in my USB mice as I don't remember to turn it off after every usage. Don't know whether it is worth the tradeoff, but with my new MacBook Air I only have one USB port and I wanted to leave it free without having to resort to a USB hub. I wish I had stepped up and purchased the Mac Mighty Mouse, the Bluetooth model I use with my iMac works flawlessly and hasn't needed a battery change in four months."
4,"very reliable and well built, but hard on batteries","I've had this mouse for two years and it has performed very well. No skips (except on glossy surfaces), good scroll wheel, and small enough to pack unobtrusively. I've used this with two laptops now, my Dell Latitude and now my Macbook. It worked equally well on both, but the Mac bluetooth setup was easier and more reliable. The only downside is that it will go through a set of AA batteries in a week if I leave it on. It powers itself down when it hasn't been touched in a while, but it still uses a lot of power. I would recommend a set of rechargeable Ni-MH or non-recharge Li batteries to cut down on battery costs.Very good tracking for a non-laser mouse."
2,Poor connection quality,"This mouse is cute and I didn't have problems with the tracking, but I stopped using it pretty quickly because it loses its connection to the computer constantly. I am using a Macbook Pro and have switched to the Apple bluetooth mouse which stays connected with no issues whatsoever."
3,Nice Mouse. Mediocre Battery Life,"I have two of these, one Bluetooth, one using a dongle. The Bluetooth version dies when the batteries will still run its sister for a couple more weeks. Other than that, it's a nice mouse."
4,Not too Bad,"Mouse works very well. Have a small issue, and that is sometimes it seems to skip a bit. It won't move for a moment, and when it finally does, it goes much further than you thought it would go. Besides that, it works great on my Macbook Pro."
3,Lacking one important feature,"This mouse is lightweight, small, (half the size of my optical mouse), easy to use, and frees up a USB port (plus no wires to tangle with my phone line.)BUT the mouse buttons cannot be reprogrammed. I do alot of cut and paste in my work and am used to being able to press the scroll bar to paste text. I couldn't do it with this bluetooth mouse.I called Kensington's customer support (very friendly, helpful, and answered the phone with a minimum of numbers to punch.) They told me this mouse is not designed to have its buttons reprogrammed. I suggested that R&D; be informed that purchasers of $50 mice expect to be able to reprogram their mouse buttons.I'm returning this mouse because I'm in the window for no hassle returns. If reprogramming mouse buttons is not a big deal for you, this is not a bad point device."
2,Wished for more,Love the feel and portability. What I do not like is the responsiveness. At times very sluggish and frustrating. Battery life is disappointing as well.
2,Just OK,"One of the reasons I chose this mouse, was because Apple recommended it as one that would offer true smooth scrolling. It turns out that this mouse has the same click scroll as many others. It jerks one line at a time ... the clicking is quite loud I might add. Also, I have to set the tracking speed very low because the cursor jerks all over the screen if I don't. Sometimes just clicking on System Preferences corrects the problem, but if I had it to do over, I'd buy something else."
1,Does not work with my Brand New Macbook,"I bought this mouse to go with my new macbook. I set it up, followed all the directions, and nothing. It wouldnt connect. Returned it."
3,Pretty god,The arms are sensitive. you move it alittle hard and it breaks and dosent come back in. Other then that its pretty good for avatar fans. Avatar roku is awesome. People should get this.
1,Not Delta's best effot,"Delta has a reputation for building high-quality tools that will last a long time. Unfortunately, this tool falls far short in my estimation. The poor construction is my biggest complaint with this saw. The aluminum table is flimsy and the saw frame is not rigid. In fact, my saw was so poorly constructed that it shook while running. The dealer suggested I try different blade. This is literally the worst tool I've ever owned.If you have a need for a bandsaw, spend a little extra money and purchase one of the heavier 14"" models."
4,"Delta 10"" Bandsaw - Initial Impressions","First impressions are important - The saw came assembled except for the table, legs and lamp. All of the material is reasonably high quality. This is a saw for the home or a hobbiest. It is not a production shop saw. The table is comparatively small and light. The saw comes with a miter gage but not a rip fence, an important omission. An accessory fence is available and you may as well order it now. The stand is a little alkward to assembly but the end result is sturdy and should require little attention. The blade appears easy to change and the tensioning adjustments are convenient and well thought out."
2,Sci-Fi Classic Impersonator,"This CD has a good collection of songs from Sci-Fi movies. However, the songs are not the original movie music. While some may sound very close (2001 was a good copy) others are a bit disappointing. If your looking for inexpensive sci-fi music, this is a good option. Otherwise stick to the original soundtracks."
5,Best translation I've found,"After searching many different translations of the Gita, I came upon this stellar translation by Alan Jacobs. This was the one that spoke to me - in it's simplicity and it's direct and lucid language. The power of the Gita is present in this translation and Jacobs adds helpful and insightful comments about the text that are illuminating and thought provoking. Highly recommended."
2,Doesn't twist and lock as easily as image suggests,"Go with the regular wire, this does not ""twist and lock"" the way picture hanger wire is supposed to. I am disappointed, since that is what the instructions tell you to do."
4,"strong, works well","I used this product to jury rig a coin-op drying machine with a discreet and nearly invisible pull-cord so that it would give free service.This wire is very strong, and the only downside is that when trying to tie knots with it you will probably need a small pair of pliers in order to bend and manipulate it. For my purposes it worked very well and has yet to break, even after many repeated yanks.If you are looking for something with the flexibility and thin diameter of fishing line this is NOT it - this is a wire and it has both the thickness and gross (but not fine) flexibility of a wire. It is not meant for precise work, but otherwise it is very strong and tends to be easy to work with when used in longer lengths."
1,Invisible hanging wire,"Very disappointing! This isn't wire, it's nothing but heavy plastic. Wouldn't recommend if you want wire. I'm not sure I will ever use. Very deceiving title"
1,Stay away from this!!! Breaks after about 10 minutes of use.,"I would give this minus 5 stars if I could. The blade broke after about 10 minutes of use cutting straight lines in thin plastic.Since I was changing from a 1/4"" blade, I had to reset all my guides, tracking and tension. The upper blade support was about 1/4"" above the surface of the plastic. I've been doing this for 25+ years so I know how to set up a saw for a particular blade.This blade broke after about 10 minutes. And it was probably less than 5 minutes of actual cutting. The job at hand required trimming a stack of 3/8 x 1/8 plastic strips to length.An extended fence was used which supports the plastic strip on both sides of the blade. A cutout was placed in the fence at the blade position and a stop was placed in the T-Fence slot so once the blade got through the plastic it never touched the extended fence."
2,THIS CD IS MISLEADING,THIS CD HAS SOME GREAT SONGS ON IT BUT NOT ONE HAS THE ORIGINAL ARTIST. THE WAY THE AD LOOKS YOU'D THINK YOU WERE GETTING A VARIOUS ARTIST CD NOT UNKNOWN ARTISTS SINGING OTHER PEOPLES SONGS. THE SONGS WERE COPIED WELL BUT I STILL FEEL THE NEED FOR A REFUND
1,Bilingual baby Russian,"The quality of the picture is bad, the subject matter for a toddler is pretty boring, it's just a person reading Russian words outloud. My toddler did not show much interest in this video at all."
1,Rip Off!,They advertise $0.12 per coin. If you do the math ($0.12 x 240=$28.80) you are being truly ripped off. How dumb do they think you/we are?
4,"Like this album. My favorite track, ""Right Next To Me.""",Talk about old skool...Only one concern. Track five (Always) of this cd ablum has a gitch like a missed beat of the music track. I wouldn't say this cd skips. I think the beat(s) were not timed right & sounds like a doubled beat when not needed? Remastered glitch? Recording error? Everything else plays perfectly.
3,product good but packaging too big,Fungicide seems effective but it came packed in a packaging 3x its size! Absolutely wasteful! Caused me a bomb for a friend to redirect it to me.
4,A welcome debut,"Absorbing and engaging mystery novel. Yes, it is a bit long on domestic details - Robyn is a stressed-out single mother, we get it - but the plot and characters make up for this. The only let down was the ending, which felt like an abridged version that the author was ordered to write by an editor."
2,Badly written chick-lit,"A new genre of detective fiction, recently much in evidence. Young, beautiful, brilliant, plucky etc. etc. heroine, solves mystery and gets her man! And is supermom besides, with adorable twins (what else?) one of each, and a de rigeur dysfunctional family, but all cardboard cutouts. On the plus side, I did think she had glimmerings of a good book in there somewhere - I might pick up her 5th or 6th to see if her talent, and she seems to have some, has matured."
3,Classic recording,"This music is simply exhilarating. However, upon closer inspection, this ensemble isn't playing at a professional level. They're not together, not in tune and the musical possibilities aren't really explored. Just good readings by eager beavers."
4,Performance Mistakes,"Having heard this recording on it's original vinyl release, I have found it to be ok, but I have heard performance mistakes in Lincolnshire Posy(Euphonium 4th mvt) if I remember correctly, and I heard too many tempo variations too my liking. North Texas under Corcoran and Eastman under Hunsburger have done far better interpretations of these works."
5,A great introduction to TBM's style,"This was not the first album by TBM that I ever heard, but I think it's a great place to start for anyone who wants to explore their discography. One thing that I like about TBM is how they can make an album different from another, while still keeping to a consistent mood and sound. While this album is certainly different from their current album, there are still shreds of it present in their current work. It's a very pretty, and dark album and a great place to start for a budding TBM fan."
2,Cheap,When I received this poster it looked like it was printed on a color laserjet. With shipping and handling it was $20. No way was it worth it. I'm sure other posters from the same company are the same way. What are these bootleg posters?
3,"Attractive, runs small, best for thin legs with small calves","I actually returned these, because although I typically wear a 9.5, the 9.5 was pretty small here. The arch area is quite narrow...so your feet are hanging over that area. Not a huge problem, but it contributes to a feeling of instability.Not terribly long, either--go one half size up from your typical size.I didn't love the heel, either, as it narrows to a point from a wider area. It gives you a little ""hoof"" appearance, which isn't great if you have big calves. Best for thin women with thin ankles and calves.Be aware that the leather on the sides is metallic!!!! Very 80s.A neat shoe, but just not one I thought I would get any wear out of..."
4,Complex Geometry,"I have never had a course on complex analysis, nor on complex geometry. All my knowledge in Geometry and Analysis came from the ""Real"" world. Nevertheless, I started studying by my own and found this text very interesting. Using it side-by-side with Nakahara's book, I had a good balance between the necessary formalism (Huybrecht's book) and the main topics and intuition (Nakahara's book)."
4,Looks great but my Houdini broke out!!!,"This is a very great looking and rather easy to assemble and take down crate. My problem was that Sophie, my little 13lb. Havanese worked on the bars until she was able to bend them out of the bottom holes and squeeze out! We had to use black zip ties along the bottom to anchor the bars in. We even watched her by remote video we sat up when we went out one night. She was so funny and diligent in her task of escaping from her crate. Now that we have solved the problem with the zip ties she seems to have given up and settles down after we leave. This is a great item unless you have a strong dog who wants to escape and doesn't give up easily!"
2,:(,"This item was shipped and received within 3 days, which was excellent, however, it said it was a new item and it definately didn't look new, it looked used. Not sure I would order from seller again for that one reason. Product did look how it was picture though."
5,a nice product,"I bought this watch for my bf and he really like it.The design is nice and he has no problem with it (until now).The shipping was quick,the package arrived in a timely manner.It was my first order here but not the last one for sure...oh and i almost forgot.. they have one of the best prices for this product online.I recomand it !"
1,Revised View. Nice Watch but.... NO WAURENTEE!!,REVISED..THERE IS NO MANUFACTURER WAURENTEE WITH THIS PRODUCT!!!I have a problem with watch and service center says I need a manufactures waurentee card. No card came with the watch. In the fine print of the item description it says Amazon.com waurentee. That means 30 days only. Bad business.My original review.Very high quality look and feel. Reasonable price.The blue dial color is quite dark. Looks elegant in brighter light. Looks almost black in dim light.
3,Good resource but......Something Missing,"I am surprised that they did not mention www.centerfoldstrips.com. With one phonecall they organized our bachelor party with limousine service, a party location with food an drinks & exceptionally hot strippers."
4,Like The Improvements,"I was a huge fan of the Coolboarders series on the original Playstation so i was glad when this agme was released. Apart from the amazing new graphics this game has loads more new options. There are 7 different modes which will keep you playing and playing until the early hours of the morning. As with most of the great sports games you have to obtain a licence, well thsi now applies in this game. The amount of work you have to put into this game makes it worth the money as you will still be playing this games months after you have purchased it"
2,This is a game you won't even look at after you play SSX!,"This is a game that I just don't like. The controls aren't even close to as smooth as SSX's and what's this nonsense about this game having more tricks than SSX? That's crazy talk! In this game you have to get huge air just to pull a misty! In SSX, however you can pull a quadruple misty with three grabs off the same amout of air. I believe that i have said enough to convince anyone to save their money and not buy this game."
3,An OK Lathe,"I have found this lathe to be pretty functional, but not as good as the JET 12"" variable speed lathe that my brother just purchased. For the $, the Jet is a better buy -- heavier, nicer finish, and has less wobble than the Delta lathe. I wish I had purchased the Jet.."
3,A good choice for a beginner or a small shop,"I've had this lathe for five years, and have now outgrown it. But for a beginner it was easy to set up, has good smooth variable speed control, and its easy to find chucks and accesories for it. If you are just getting started and want a lathe that you will be able to use until you become really serious about turning, this is not a bad choice at all. But a lot of people have had problems with bearings in the first couple of months - so if it does not work well right away, get a new one. Delta has good customer service and support. I have no regrets about this machine at all, and am likely to keep it in the shop for smaller jobs after I have moved up to something bigger."
4,Very Nice!!,"Ah Denali, my favorite new tool company. they make midgrade tools at a very low price. I own several of their tools and am very pleased with them. These are great-very functional and easy to use."
4,Superwinch,"I used this winch within 24hrs of installing it, extracted myself and a buddy's vehicle. No problems with the functionality so far. A few things that may or may not be of interest to some people:1. It is heavy. If you have a Wrangler with stock suspension, expect your front end to sag.2. The plastic cover that protects the controller hook-up broke on the first removal. so now, instead of it just hanging on, out of the way while the controller is connected, you have to put it in your pocket so that you don't lose it. No biggie for me.3. The big ""S"" sticker was no where to be found in the box, again no problem because they don't pay me to advertise for them anyway, but also, most of the other safety and information stickers are coming off and this was right from the box. I'm guessing this unit was one of the last ones out since the Talon has been on the market as the replacement.All in all, for under $600 i've got a fantastic winch that will hopefully last for quite a while."
5,good purchase,"Works as advertised - only used once so far. Easy install, but I was replacing a POS rugged ridge that only worked for a year. I bought up since the cheap one didn't last. The cover is good idea, it has kept the winch from getting splashed."
1,Mort,"Hi, My name is Mort and I am an 8 month old lab and New Foundland mix. I love to chew. Santa brought me this for Christmas. I loved it! Mom was not happy that the ball and the treats lasted less than 8 hours in the house. Mom says I need to take better care of my toys! Not a toy for a puppy that LOVES to chew!!!"
5,Jones' outrageous best!,"This is far from a typical children's book! It is a fabulous, funny, wildly imaginative coming-of-age tale about a family (or two families) and ... wars. Parental wars, sibling wars, wizard wars, gang wars!It is impossible to convey the feel of the wacky, warm, confused and confusing bunch of characters that Jones created in this amazing yarn. Successive versions of reality are revealed and then peeled away to reveal another below, like an onion. She has created many wonderful and wildly differing worlds in her many books; this may just be the best and most original."
3,Performance not noticed,I've had this on my truck for about 2 months now. I haven't noticed any difference in performance or gas mileage. I am still testing the truck to see if there is an actual improvement in fuel economy. I installed this with a K&N filter. I installed this on a 2005 Ford F150 FX4.
1,Complicated explanations of simple ideas,"I have the 6th edition. Perhaps the book has improved in the 10th. I find complicated explanations of simple ideas over and over. I have only read to page 70. In the beginning of section 3.1 Chemical Equations, the book suggests the following substitutions: We read the + sign to mean ""reacts with"" and the arrow as ""produces"". This scheme will not produce good English for any chemical equation and will produce incorrect statements for most (A + B -> C + D does NOT mean to imply that C reacts with D). What could be simpler than + means ""and""? Then the arrow means ""reacts to produce"", and everything works. In the same paragraph, the book confuses number and numeral and gets it wrong. If you look with a critical eye, you will find slightly off statements every few pages. I could not recommend this book to a beginner who does not have a teacher to smooth over the rough points."
4,Chemistry: The Central Science (10th edition),"I am pleased with my purchase of this product. It seemed to be previously owned, which I was unaware of (it was not made clear) when I first ordered it. However I really like the textbook and it even has some bonuses I was not expecting (ie: answers to problems and side comments that ease in the understanding of the text). So the sale could have been made more clear, but I am definitely happy with my purchase."
5,Best out there,My AP chemistry class used this book as well as my college General Chemistry class. Ive compared it with other popular chemistry books and none of them explain as thoroughly and cover as wide a breadth of topics as this book does. If your having problems with your current General Chemistry textbook you should definitely buy this one as an adjunct to it.
3,"Probably written for AP Chemistry, not actual College Chemistry","I bought this book to help prepare for the fundamentals of engineering exam. I had sold my old College Chemistry back to the bookstore and was looking for something to replace it.This book is easy to understand, and has good diagrams and illustrations making concepts easy to visualize (more than one color in a text book is always a good thing). However, it is primarily conceptual and is very light on the Mathematics, and the nitty gritty details of real application. Although it is a much easier read than my previous text book, I don't think it was technical enough."
5,Best Book for AP Chemistry,"I took AP Chemistry online, and this book was recommended as a companion to the online course. All I can say is...wow. This is by far the best college chemistry book on the market. Everything--and I mean everything!--is defined and explained in this book, with plenty of practice problems and answers. There's no filler as seen with regular high school textbooks; rather, the diagrams and pictures have significance. This book explained everything to me, leaving me with very, very few questions I actually had to ask the teacher. It even helped me score a 5 on the AP exam. Whether you're taking the AP class in high school, or the general chem class in college, no textbook is better than this."
5,Exellent Introduction to Chemistry,"This is the Chemistry AP textbook used at my school. It is complete but not overly complex. It has abundant practice problems, and the examples are in-depth and helpful. I firmly believe that reading this book will get you a 5 on the AP exam. This book has given me enough background to do well on the national chemistry olympiad, and I highly recommend it."
3,chemistry the central science,"The book was in mint condition, and shipping was extremely fast, the problem I had was it came with a media pak, I paid alot for this not realizing that there were different media paks, my daughter spent a week trying to get into her college class with this, numerous e-mails waiting 24 hrs for an answer, numerous phone calls, only to find out it was wrong and we had to pay another $50.00 on line to get the right codes to get into the class. It should be listed somewhere what the different classes are we could have bought a used book & the code on line and saved alot of money."
3,Good Condition but delivery delayed,"I bought this book on March 22, 2008 and received it April 12, 08. This is unexpected. I bought another book at the same day and got it within 4 days."
2,Chemistry text,"I found this text to be quite confusing and it does not use many visual examples and ""real life"" examples to explain the difficult concepts. I have definitely had better chemistry texts."
1,Dented,"Good book, but arrived horribly dented. The package looked fine, so it must have been packaged like that. I was not amused."
5,:),Very pleased with my purchase. The book was in better condition than described. It looks NEW! Would definitely do buisness with this person again. Thank you.
3,"Just Your Average, Everyday Chemistry Book","I really can't say anything special about this particular chemistry book. It has all the information I needed to pass my chemistry final, and much more, but is written in a pretty dry manner. I'd recommend Khan Academy and other youtube tutorials before landing a bunch of money on this particular book (as long as you don't have to do assignments directly from it)."
3,Not as advertise,"The product I purchase was advertise as new however on the second page of the book was written Property of St. Mary's CCD, therefore it had been bought previously and used in a religious education program. A brand new book is not written on and has not sat a previous owner's bookshelf"
3,"Nice watch, crummy band","I got one of these as a gift a few years ago. Its a nice looking watch and keeps good time, etc (as most modern watches do), but the achilles heel is the leather band. The first one broke after less than a year, and the replacement one I got from them lasted about the same. After a few years of replacing bands, when you include the cost of taking it to a jeweler (replacement requires a special punch), you might as well have just bought another watch. Frustrating."
2,DVD viewing quality,This would be a good dvd except for the viewing quality. Quality is very bad. The people who manufactured this dvd need to check the quality of their products before offering them for sale.The dvd was very hard to view because of the quality. For this reason the dvd was very disappointing.
5,Eagle frame,"I have not put it on the car yet, but it came as described and is officially licenced (as the hologram on back implies). good value/quality for price."
5,Dayco Drive Belt,"Price was fantastic!! Local store wanted $139 for same item that we purchased for less than $30, same brand name and model and all."
5,Christmas is Coming,"Received this CD just in time for the Christmas Holidays, and played it every day until the Holidays were over. Enjoyed every tune on the CD. Highly recommend to anyone who loves GOOOOOD Piano music."
4,Best Linux user magazine,"This is, in my view, the best ""using Linux"" magazine on the market. There's a lot of information in each issue, it's an entertaining read, and the coverage is broad enough that you're likely to learn a fair amount if you read it cover to cover.The quality is sometimes uneven, though. The ""Roundup"" feature, in particular, has of late used such narrow review criteria that it feels like looking through a keyhole. The all white male editorial staff that they seem to have settled on can be annoying as well. As others have pointed out, though, the biggest negative to this magazine is the fact that it's only available in paper form with an accompanying DVD and, outside of the UK, an astonishing subscription price. I'd love to keep getting it, but have a hard time justifying to myself a subscription price that's now north of $15 US per issue. When we start talking that kind of money I'd think that I'd rather donate it to open source projects."
3,"Great magazine, HORRIBLE PRICING!!","There are several Linux magazines out there, but this one, Linux Format is probably #1, Linux Pro Magazine is probably #2. However, they are priced ridiculously high...about $150 to $200 per year!!! NOT BEGINNER FRIENDLY!!It is more than about time the Linux FORMAT started offering subscriptions without the DVDs or even better - an online .PDF version to lower the costs. Until then, I will stick with the MANY online resources and FREE online magazines out there.Linux is about freedom and being advanced...being cutting edge and thinking outside the box, yet Linux Format continues to ""stay the course"" and only offer a subscription with DVD. The magazines pile up, the DVDs never see the light of day (how many distros can you possibly test drive in a year for God's sake???) and your money gets wasted.As far as I am concerned and as much as I love the writing behind Linux Format, I think the executive people behind it are ripping us all off."
5,Best Mag out there,"I agree with others, Best Linux Magazine out there, you will get a lot for you money. But it is a lot of your $$."
1,DOnt buy Tissot. Nice watch but broke after 18 months and Tissot wanted 200.00 to fix,"Wore it very lightly for about 18 months. I have about 10 watches from cheap solar casios to a Ball ""Engineer."" Story:So I think it needs a new battery. I have it replaced. Still seems funny, but I don't get around to looking at it. SO I finally send it in 2 months after the warranty runs out. Tissot (Swatch) wants 200.00 to fix. WOuld not say whats wrong, just 200.00. SO I guess every 2-3 years they keep wanting to charge you 200 for your watch. Their web page even says this. 3-5 years full service, 200.00. Sheesh can't by anything nice now. Don't by Tissot."
5,Very nice watch and great shipping,"The watch is very comfortable and quite nice looking. Adjusting the strap took a bit of effort, but there are good instructions available on the Tissot website. 15 minutes later, the watch fits snugly and is ready for you to receive compliments.The shipping was a bit pricey, but very, very quick (considering that I live outside of USA). I received the watch 3 days after placing the order. It came in the impressive Tissot box, with a catalog of Tissot watches and a booklet about the history of Tissot."
5,Great Gift Idea!,"I bought this watch to gift to my husband on our 5 year Anniversary of meeting the first time. He was thrilled. It looks really sporty, yet elegant."
5,Wonderful Watch for Sport or Dress,"One of the best watches I have owned, I wear it everywhere it is so nice to wear with formal dress, and is rugged enough to wear when sporting!A watch for all occassions, and is perfect with time, does not skip a beat. Not one scratch because of the Saph. Crystal."
4,delta 28-150 bandsaw review,I read Mr. Jones review on this saw about not having a factory rip fence. under delta accessories delta part number 28-181 is the correct rip fence at only 17.50. I use this saw every day in my custom kitchen and trim business. i am very pleased with the saw.
5,nice hobby saw,"I got this Delta bandsaw to cut boards for push-sticks, bird houses and hang-up crafts for my wife. It does a very good job at that although when cutting curves the blade somtimes wanders to the left side. For beginning woodworkers I would recommend this band saw. It is very safe if you know how to use it right. If you are looking to resaw boards and cut beams, dont buy it. It was not designed to do that."
4,Nice little saw for money,"I didn't have room for a large saw and this one does what I want. Worked fine right out of the box, no adjustments needed. Sure there are ""better"" large saws. I mounted it on a large block of wood for stability, and it allows me to move it around my bench, rather than bolting it down., I just used a piece of 6 x 12 doug fir about 16 inches long, you can probably find this at a construction site doing some wood shoring, I picked mine up in the Bay while fishing (always interesting things on the scum line at tide change."
1,Very low quality tool.,Motor badly underpowered....guide block hardware not rigid enough to cut decent circles....great if all you want to cut is cardboard.
3,Home owner & hobbyist,"My son and I are looking at buying this product, but the lack of a Factory Rip-Fence is a concern. We will have to make one."
5,A treasure,"Indeed, this album is a treasure and a classic. I grew up with it. My grandmother, born in the ""old country"", instantly found herself transported back home. My assimilated American parents recognized the warmth and the humor and the beauty in the songs and the immense talent of the singer. And I discovered my roots.The culture that Theodore Bikel sings of was largely wiped out in the Holocaust. It's important to me that we not let the music perish. Theodore Bikel is a national treasure-- and this album is a gift for generations to come.Many will know Bikel from his classic performance in ""The Sound of Music"". Now in his mid-80s, he is still performing on stage. And it is still a joy to hear him."
5,Awesome,"Outstanding book! Wonderful study, convicting, well worth the time, so much to learn, enjoy, I would recommend it to anyone. It is so true, informative, and easy to understand and follow"
1,"I tried, but...","I just couldn't. Okay, I will admit that even though I am a little biased, I decided to give her story a shot. I saw this at my local dollar store, and I read it. Needless to say, I quickly recycled it. It was not even worth my dollar, though I am glad that that is where the publisher decided to sell the book, so no one else has to spend the twenty some dollars it supposedly is worth.It is just a watered down, whiny, and ""basic"" biography of a many-sided woman.HOWEVER, kudos to her for being able to live her life with one leg, and for being so dedicated to animals, but I didn't need to read this to form an opinion on that, and neither do you.Save your dollar."
2,Interesting Life - Boring Book,"Heather Mills McCartney is a survivor - true. She's done a lot for amputees and victims of mine fields - true. But does she deserve the media hype? I don't think so. She turned her life around and has done a lot of good things, but I really didn't care to read all about it. A lot of people have had hard lives, but let's face it, she was almost unknown until she married one of the most famous men in the world.The book was a total bore - Heather, if you had hired a better ghost writer, I might have felt differently."
1,Same old story -- you've heard it before,"It's the same old rags-to-riches story. We've heard it a hundred times. It is no different coming from a billionaire's wife. Sorry, but it's a little trite.The part that bothers me most is that she claims Paul McCartney is incapable of compromise -- that he got rich and famous at a very young age, and this made him unable to compromise. My response is this: you cannot have a successful and beautiful 30-year marriage to the same woman, and raise 4 happy and healthy children, if you are ""incapable of compromise"". Her attitude is poor and selfish. It totally turned me off and I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
3,Decent,"I am a VWW fan and love her Tamara Hayle mystery series. However, this book is not up to VWW usual standard. It was predictable from page one! There was nothing special about the characters and they all lacked any real depth.I can't wait until VWW moves back into writing her Tamara Hayle mysteries. This particular genre is not her strong suit."
4,Always True to You,"I've read everything published that Valerie W. Wesley has written and I truly enjoy her imagination and the way she portrays her fantasies through her pen. All of the other reviews adequately describe the storyline which, I agree, is not drama filled. The story itself was just plain, simple and quite enjoyable. As usual, I started on a Saturday morning and was done by Monday morning. Very quick and light. The most important lessons of what love is really about are the areas the author has chosen to explore in this novel, as well as how our relationship with our parents determine what type of parents we will become. Quite interesting !!! If you're on vacation and looking for a nice pleasant short story, you've got to read this."
3,A disappointing story,"This story of Randall Hollis and the women who ""love"" him is rather trite and uninspiring. The chronic womanizer gets his in the end but other than that, the story has no real merit. The Tamara Hayle mysteries are much better than this."
2,COULD'VE BEEN BETTER,"VALERIE IS A GREAT WRITER, WITH GREAT THOUGHTS BUT IT TAKES HER TO LONG TO GET THERE. I ENJOYED THE STORY BUT NOT UNTIL I WAS PAST THE MIDDLE. IT TOOK TO LONG TO GET TO THE POINT. THE STORY WAS ABOUT A YOUNG WOMANAIZING MAN AND HIM COMING TO GRIPS WITH REALITY."
1,Don't bother,I started this book and it took me about five days to read up to page thirty. I absolutely hated this book. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
2,Boring,"This story lacked a plot and the climax was a huge let down. Each time I put it down it was really hard to pick back up, but I'm one of those people who needs closure."
5,Lean favorite 5,"This recording of the Prokofiev 5th is lean, not explicitly powerful or spooky.However it is swift and rhythmic under the cool neutral impression. I suppose they took the time to get to know and feel the melodies. The tone is thin but also beautiful and crisp clear. I noticed at first listening that there was something special to this recording, a special pace and motion, which keeps my attention and makes me enjoy the listening.As a first choice of Prokofiev 5, I'd choose a more traditional recording, for example Temirkanov in St Petersburg, or Dutoit/Montreal, which are also cutting edge in their own right. Another fine recording is the Ashkenazy/Concertgebouw, It is also a bit different, cool but at the same time energetic and spooky."
5,How does it rate on a scale from 1 to 10? I'll tell ya!,"Are you reading this set of reviews because you do not have this recording already?Yes?Alright. Stop reading. This one is one of those releases...y'know the ones for which there's no reason you should refrain from having it now. Right now.On a strict 1-10 scale this release scores a 41.93 for the instrumentalization and a 42.3 for the recording quality.......for a combined score of 837,001 out of ten. Which, if you think about it, is a pretty respectable score."
3,"Good music, bad play",The piano play isn't the greatest here. I would say it is actually bad. He doesn't understand the music he plays. I was really disappointed to hear a play on this CD. Especially in the 3rd concert. The orchestra part isn't bad though.
5,ONE OF THE BEST VERSIONS OF THESE CONCERTOS,"I am a pianist of 67 years old. Byron Janis creates a new feeling about Rachmaninoff's most popular concertos. The sound here is impecable. I owned the ""record"" but this CD gives the listener a real treat. Thank you for making it available to us ""music-lovers"". Great price too!"
3,Great reference,"I had this book as a text for a class and as a text book it stinks, I give it 1 star. However it isn't a text book but rather a reference book. As a reference book I give this 5 stars. It is great if you need a little refresher on optics but this is not something to learn optics from."
2,Delta drill press,"When I recieved this baby, I thought it looked pretty good.However The parts in the box were from two different models.and the holes in the base did not fit the column base. five holes in the column and four in the base..Delta has not yet fixed this problem.."
3,good value but not a great tool,"Bought one of these about 8 years ago after having had excellent experiences with American-made Delta products (eg, Unisaw, shaper, etc.)I was a bit disappointed with this tool. It was difficult to assemble & the instructions were virtually incomprehensible---had to give up on them and just use common sense/knowledge to get it together. Fit and finish is quite rough in comparison to US made tools----some filing/deburring/minor machining was required to get everything to work smoothly.Runout was a bit more than I had hoped for, but was within the tolerances I need for woodworking. For more precise tolerances needed in metal working--no way.The tool works okay, but for those into tool aesthetics (as am I) it comes up short."
5,Fine tool good value,"I bought my drill press about 4 years ago. It's been a real ""work horse"" in my shop. I have not measured run out but it is trivial compared to the precision required for woodworking. Fit and finish are fine for my machine. I do not recall any difficulty with assembly."
3,This Is Not A High Quality Machine - It's Functional,I purchased this drill press in 1999 and have used it about 12 months. It is functional. I have used this unit on wood (it's intended purpose) and metal (I know but I had to do it). I do not use this on even a weekly basis so I went for price when I bought the drill press.It is worth it's price. It has poor fit and finish. It could be greatly improved. If you are not using a drill press everyday or are a weekender this is a good value - also consider a jet. They are both made on that little island.
2,Winsome Wood Book Case,"Box arrived on time and everything looked OK, One of the shelf looked like someone filled a hole with putty but didn't sand it before the stain went on. Top shelf is warped, I couldn't tighten enough, there's a big gap on both sides. Wasn't a very good buy. It is sturdy though."
3,Shelf,"It serves it's purpose, was easy to put together and a decent price. I just needed it in my office for more books."
5,Excellent bookcase and value,"piece of cake putting this together. It's all wood, very sleek & simple. We bought 2 and put them side by side behind our loveseat. lots of room to put books, etc. and some little knick-knacks on the top shelf."
5,"Sturdy, nice looking piece of furniture","I was looking for something that would hold my printer and paper as well as a makeshift storage area on the first floor for baby items for my granddaughter. I also ordered the 3 baskets to go with it. Directions say you need 2 people to put together, but I had no problems at all doing by myself. Sturdy, nice looking piece - exactly the size and quality I wanted."
1,Bad Quality,"I was very disappointed with this shelf. The top shelf looked like it was upside down and the unfinshed side is facing up. The wood is not nice looking and it was scratched on the top. Definately not worth the 69.99 that I paid for it. Also, isn't exactly what is shown in picture."
3,Prettier in the picture....,"The wood, instead of being the glossy espresso that I was hoping for, is not that glossy and has different tones of espresso throughout. Probably not noticeable much unless you're up close to it. Also, with the shipping charge, it's pretty pricey for what I think is lower-quality furniture. Oh, and one of the flush that hides the holes where the screwes go in was missing in my shipment. Not a big deal for most, but it's kinda annoying. I paid for that little piece of wood!"
2,WINSOME WOOD SHELF,"This was the second Winsome wood shelf I had purchased. After receiving the first one, which met my expectations with a decent sleek and shiny finish, I decided to order another. The second was NOT the same quality. The finish was dry and dull, had some minor nicks in it, and its finish did not match the first one I bought, dull vs shiny. Instead of having it ""out there"" where it could be seen next to the sofa along with its companion shelf as I had wanted, I put cork on the top of it and shoved it in a corner. I'm not sure where it will go next. I considered ""trying it again"" by ordering another one, but then decided it wasn't worth the gamble."
5,Great buy,These shelves are made from real wood so they look good and are sturdy. The assembly was quick and easy. 15 minutes tops.
3,Great strategy 40 years ago when there was no Black-Scholes,"The basic premise of this book is to long stock and delta hedge w/ out of the money warrants. This was great when the tax incentives encouraged corporations to sell bonds w/ detachable warrants rather than selling convertible bonds. In addition, valuing the warrants was tricky prior to the use of the Black-Scholes model. This strategy - delta neutral covered calls - is profitable when the market has peaked out but you can get your handed to you if you employ it in a scenario such as '99-'00. Further their reocmmendations that you short more as your warrants fall is very dangerous - shorting a lot of gamma. The warrant game played itself out and the authors made a a lot of money. This is a very interesting book written by a very profitable hedge fund manager, but I would not recommend attempting to replicate this strategy w/ LEAPS. Pricing is much tighter now so your margin of error has dramatically decreased"
5,The Complete Standard Poodle,"This is a must have book for Poodle owners. Out of print, so it will not be easy to find. Worth it if you can pick up a reasonably priced copy."
1,not transparent enough,"I bought this tape for variety of color choices at a lower price for highlighting student vocabulary words in our class poems.It was a waste of money.The tape is too opaque to read the word it highlights, making it only good for underlining rather than covering the words.It is too hard to sever with the cutting teeth on the roll (even for me) stretching before breaking off.Very disappointed.It also is a very small quantity."
3,Faraway Opens with Promise Then Meanders,"Movie sequels are rarely as strong as the original, and ""Faraway, so Close"" is a good example. ""Faraway, so Close"" gets off to a good start-it's great to simply get caught up on what the characters have been up to since the mesmorizing original.After a while, though, it gets bogged down in the middle with a far-fetched mix of gangsters, angels, and more circus trapeze artists. The action-packed climax, which I won't reveal here, seemed more from a Stallone film than anything in ""Wings of Desire."""
3,Peter Hanke--for once sorely missed. . . .,"Peter Hanke--an early challenger to the Group 47's lock on post-war German literature--was sorely missed in the sequel to Wings of Desire. Hanke helped Wenders produce a script in Wings of Desire that did the best job anyone could have done in bottling the mystery of pre-unification Berlin. However, Far Away... is a Wessi/Ami comic book in comparison. Once we get over the pleasant surprise of Otto Sander's wildman character (in Wings... he was just a dutiful angel), we're left with Wenders' inconsistant script. He definitely did not do the reunified Berlin the favor he did the ""old"" Berlin."
3,Where is the DVD for Wings Of Desire?,"This is almost a great film: beautifully shot, the transfer to DVD should be remarkable. Unfortunately structurely the film falls apart about two thirds of the way through, leaving the viewer feeling slightly ripped off.My main complaint - where & when is the DVD release of Wings Of Desire - far and away the superior of the two films (pun intended)."
2,A major dissapointment,"I liked Wings of Desire so much that I rented and watched this sequel. Frankly it was major dissapointment to me. It seems Wenders tries to have a ""real plot"" and some ""action"" in the movie. But the story is incoherent and laughable at some points."
5,This is the Best Movie ever.,I loved this Movie! U cant get better than this Ladies and gentelman. Peace. HB
3,Not as good as its' predesessor,"Most of the previous comments are appropriate. My question is: how on earth can anyone justify having this available in DVD format as opposed to the far superior Wings of Desire, which remains available only in VHS?"
5,An excellent sequel,"This is much lighter and easier to follow than its progenitor, ""Wings of Desire"".This movie follows Cassiel's desire to be human. While Tariel may have hade a more ideal life (family, child, job, simple pleasures), Cassiel's story is one more of what happens when humans screw up, make bad choices, or live in denial.Can't forget Peter Falk. He reprises the best role I have ever seen him in. Also, William Defoe the Fallen Angel is something to be remembered.A truly wonderful companion movie and also wonderful on its own. I wholly recomment buying it today."
1,Void of meaning; boring enough to put you to sleep,"Starts out great, then descends into a horrifying hell of boredom and ambiguity and mixed up wastelands of celluloid. There was no point to this movie and it literally put me out; yep, it put me to sleep. I thought the beginning looked promising but then it turned into one of the most enigmatic wastes of time I have ever watched."
4,"Works Well, Very Fast, Very Hot","I have been using SMC for years and the one thing about them is they are are trouble free. The EZ 10/100/1000 Switch is no exception. Just plug it in and it works. You might say that's to be expected from a switch but not so. One thing I would have to do from time to time is use a crossover cable to connect multiple switches. Not any more. The EZ switch automatically detects the need and does the work for me.As for speed, I can't tell you how much nicer gigabit networking is than 100mb for transfering large files. Suffice to say that everything is gigabit now. 100mb just doesn't cut it.My one complaint is that, as has been reported, the device is hot, very hot. Thus the 4 stars. Make sure it is placed in a very well ventilated area. Between this, my Plasma TV and my Xbox 360, I'm looking forward to winter."
3,case gets very hot,even when idle the case is uncomfortably hot to touchI cringe to think about it with a book on top of it.
4,Lesson in Playing Card History,"Antique Playhing Cars: A Pictorial History provided much insight into many eras in past history. It is primarily a picture book so the reader must investigate the deeper meanings and significance of the various selections on their own. There are several pages of black outlines which the reader could copy and enlarge so that adding colors could provide some amusement. The serious historian can research the selection of colors but as for myself, I was content just to examine the cards as they were presented."
2,Where are you Anne?!?!?!?,"This book was so void of Anne or even her children, it made you depressed to read it. The story of the Merediths was intresting, but i think they should perhaps have their own story and not take up a whole book of Anne's. It's even harder to find Gilbert, there is NO romance between them at all in this book. This is by far my least favorite Anne book. Bottom line: good book in its self but she should have just cut Anne out of it and started a new series."
4,As funny and adventurous as other LMM books!,"I think this book is as worth-reading as the rest of the other Anne books. I think people who love kids will love this book even more because both the children of Ingleside and the Manse are so cute and witty as usual. Like Anne, I myself also take a special liking to Faith. She is so much like Anne when she was in her Green Gables days. It bought back memories of Anne Shirley especially when Faith made those apologizes and explanations...oh..that blessed child is so much like Anne herself. I also like Walter for his courage to fight for both her mother and Faith. But I think this book has put too much focus on the Meredith clan...and that there really aren't much about Shirley and Rilla in this book."
3,It was okay.,"I like all of the Anne books, but this one was a little dissapointing. It seemed like Anne wasn't really raising her children, which I didn't think was like her. Also, she didn't really seem much like the girl in 'Anne of Green Gables'. even a grown up version. It was a little sad to me."
4,"Doesn't focus so much on Anne, but still a wonderful book","Rainbow Valley is the seventh book in the 'Anne of Green Gables' series, and is a rather different one due th the fact that Anne's children are the focus of this story. Anne does have some parts of her own, and so far, she's been a good mama, but motherhood leaves her with less time to get herself into interesting situations.It's not just about the Blythe children, but some neighboring kids and a few adults too. There's a nice mix of stories here about various people, almost like a collection of short stories, but there's a couple of long story arcs that connect everything else for a coherently-written book."
3,The least interesting book of the series...,"This book is mostly about the 3 children who had moved into the manse. Even though they are very ""different"" and interesting kids, I don't find them interesting, unlike Anne was when she was younger. I've seen a review which compares Faith to Anne - in their ways of getting into all sorts of unpredictable and unexpected trouble, imaginations, and making up all sorts of original excuses... But I felt Faith lacked Anne's fire and zest and didn't impress me at all.This books is drifting apart from the series' main character - Anne. She is a small, supporting character in this book , and the closest we get to hearing about her are a few small stories about her kids... Which is my main reason for feeling this book should not belong in the Anne series..."
4,Amazingly Done,"Ever since the very first book, Anne of Green Gables, I fell in love with that sweet, wonderful, red haired girl. This story really was amazingly done, I really love reading about her growing up. She`s really grown up a lot, but to me, she`ll always be that sweet little girl."
1,"Sorry, no book","Sorry, but I ordered this book from bluvolt.com who apparently doesn't send out books, according to their recommendation list. It does sound interesting, though and I would review it if I had a chance to read it."
3,If only the film could have been based on the book...,"I E-mailed Mr. McDonald personally and gave him a message, which summed-up is the title of this review. I think the novelization is well-written. It departs from the movie in several places but where it does so it makes the story more credible, tightening it up and offering explanations for much of the confusion on the screen, and makes Capt. Miller seem more logical, as well as explaining the Weir/Beast's motives. Moreover, it plays down the gore in the film, particularly the ""in hell"" scenes. Unfortunately, there are still plot holes, but I blame these on the original screenplay.It isn't great literature, but if you want a fairly gripping read, it's a pretty good way to spend a day."
4,"VERY exciting, but what happened?","I just finished ""Event Horizon"" - it only took a couple of hours to read. From page 1 it is exciting and will probably be a good movie. I do have a big criticism - without giving anything away in the plot, what happened to the ship? Where did it go? What did it bring back? All action, no answers. With 10 pages to go the action is escalating towards a climax that leaves too many questions unanswered. Upon completion I looked around for the last half of the book!I guess the answers will be in the sequel."
5,If you want a book that makes you think......,"This is it. I read some of the ""bad reviews"" that are already on this website concerning this book. After reading the reviews, I decided that the ""bad reviews"" were unfounded, and were left by people who just didn't ""get"" the book.Black Holes are still a mystery to us, as is death, space exploration, and Heaven/Hell. This book ties all of these things together for an excellent thrill ride.Good job McDonald, this book goes down as one of my favorites of all time. I have read 100s of Fantasy novels, but science fiction novels just don't interest me. But with this book/movie, I made an exception."
4,Good book and still scary,"After watching the movie Event Horizon I realized that it is to most people more grose than scary. This was the only movie that scared me after watching it over and over again. The book is the same, its a little different than the movie, not totally, things are described better than in the movie and you get a sense of how the characters felt, like how scared they were. Anyways, I really enjoyed this book and the movie the same. If your looking for a good scare then read this book."
5,Read between the lines to get the plot.,"If you have seen the movie and really appreciated it, then the book filled all the holes. You have to read between the lines to see it though. I am not sure what you should do first though, read the book or watch the movie. I watched the movie first. To make a long review short the book is short(as is the movie,) but is gripping and as terrifying as the screenplay."
1,Gross. Terrible knowledge of physics,"Two questions,how does this ship manage to punch a hole in space to create a black hole,artifically? Secondly,why is the doctor(Sam Neill's character) the only one left alive(?!) Lastly,what the heck happened to the ship and why is it found around Neptune? Who financed this,military intelligence? Now there's an oxymoron!"
1,UGH! Too gory for my taste,"First,if the good doctor is such a great astro- physicist,how come he doesn't know that the radiation in the middle of a black hole can kill somebody?Duh! And in his emotionally disturbed state,how did he manage to get past the psycholog. screenings and profiles?Security s---- here!"
1,Disturbing,"I can completely understand how poltergesit activity can on the salvage ship,Normal people put into a tense atmosphere,tired,cranky,with serious personal problems of their own on a ship they don't like and/or openly hostile to are a disaster waiting to happen. Its calledTK."
5,"Orchestrally excellent, excitingly up-tempo performances","This conductor gives one the sense, after listening to many of his recordings, that he has that special ability to energize a score. I bought the Mercury Golden Imports LP of these performances knowing I was in for a thrilling ride and I wasn't disappointed. It seemed like ages before the CD finally appeared and it really is one to treasure. Dorati knew that if one were to play this music it should be played for all it is worth. A really fun CD that proves one doesn't have to pay full price to get the best."
5,Lovely Light Classical Music - Rhapsodies and Dances,This is a terrific grouping of pieces with the Romanian and Hungarian Rhapsody theme. Enesco's piece is delightful. Brahms' dances are also great. This is the music to get one moving on a grey day. I love it.
2,"Adequate quality, poor design","Purchase a unit with a 'slider' style cutting device on it. This one does not cut the material well, especially if you wall-mount it (as it said it was designed for). Tried it several different ways, ended up recycling them, eating the cost, and buying a better unit from IKEA. You get what you pay for in this case."
4,Hard to Find Title,This a hard-to-find film title. Saw it once when I was a kid and have always wanted to give it another look. Decent print. I'm glad I bought it for the money.
3,Bvlgari BLV Notte,I used this product before and it was the perfume. I feel the eau de cologne is a bit too watered down. The fragrance is not as strong. I will use the perfume in the future and not the eau de cologne.
2,Watered Down?,I've bought this perfume before at T.J. Maxx and it was quitea bit more potent than this bottle. That's really disappointing consideringthe cost. :(
5,"Great product, great price",I wanted to buy this for my wife on her birthday and we looked at various different malls and found it on amazon to be the most economical. She already knew that she wanted this so it came down to how soon could we receive it if we order it online and amazon did a great job as always. Planning to buy a couple more of these for friends and relatives.
1,I dont this it's original,"I bought this perfum as a gift for my sister. She lives in Brazil, so I was there and finaly could give her perfums.Unfortunately she was not happy with the perfums, because they don't have the same smell and she thinks they are not original because they don't smell the same as the other one she already has. I am very disappointed with this purchase."
4,"Interesting, and characters are good!","I did mostly enjoy this author, and several of her books, however, after reading several, they all began to seem hard to tell which one was which! I don't like the sameness of the titling theme for a start, since it is sometimes, hardly part of the story at all. I have read several of her books, and I loved some and others, I was not so enthralled. This author likes to throw in French phrases, and words, and it irrates me, since I don't know very many, (if any,) meanings of those phrases and am irrated by the fact, that the author doesn't bother to translate them either. I really liked the service of Amazon and I love their book search feature. Great service."
2,Best book in this weak series,"Faith actually liked her children this time, which was good, and I just found it more interesting and to the point this time.Note: I've read this entire series up toThe Body in the Attic: A Faith Fairchild Mystery (Faith Fairchild Mysteries), and the best rating I've given any of them is 2 stars, which is sad and says a lot about the series. I kept reading because it really has potential but it never lives up to it, so save yourself the trouble and agony and try a a different series, such as Carolyn Hart'sDeath on Demand (Death on Demand Mysteries, No. 1)series, most of which are fun and enjoyable, or stop afterThe Body in the Cast: A Faith Fairchild Mystery, which was probably the best of the series. That's my recommendation, anyway."
4,"A movie set, black bean soup, and a local election","A movie-making crew arrives in Aleford and suddenly the little town is caught up in show business. Added to this, a hotly-contested 3-way local election is being held. Faith Fairchild is asked to cater for the movie crew and to work on one of the candidate's campaigns. This puts her right in the middle of a murder of one of the actresses and one of the candidates. Her long-suffering minister husband urges her to let the police solve the murders, but as usual Faith decides to help the lawmen along with her own investigation. This is pretty standard stuff for this series and makes for entertaining reading."
2,It lacked excitment compared to the movie!!!,"I read the book after reading the movie and I was not impressed, some of the things in the book didn't even match the movie. I was dissapointed."
2,"The novel was good, not better then the movie",The novel of Ten Things I Hate About You lacked the bite of movie. Some of Kat's best quips are not in the book(probably because of the language). This was one of rare times the movie was better then the book.
3,A can of this a can of that,"There's a big difference between reworking ethnic cuisine and just dumping canned products and some meat into a slow cooker. Many of the recipes are make-believe southwestern: taco seasoning packets, canned enchilada sauce, bottled salsa, etc. The baked bean recipes were horrible; watery and tasteless. After several hours, I had to doctor up the beans in a separate pot and add barbecue sauce, ketchup, molasses and other ingredients just to make them edible. It takes so little time to make real Border-area food on the stove top that using a slow cooker is just a gimmick, at least for these recipes. It makes sense to use a slow cooker to feed a crowd, but look elsewhere for Southwestern flavors. If you must buy this book, try the recipes that use large pieces of meat, such as the whole chicken and pot roasts. They will be fairly well-seasoned and tender."
5,best little cookbook in Tucson,"Southwest Slow Cookingis my husbands favorite cookbook and leisure read. He has made almost every recipe and we have enjoyed eating them. The authors have many healthful tips and great use of fresh foods and herbs. We have gifted a copy to his daughter, an avid gardener and cook. The Flagstaff Wings are the tops!"
5,Absolutely awesome!!!,"If you are really into NWOBHM, this is one stellar collection. Songs like ""Let It Loose"" by Savage and ""Axe Crazy"" by Jaguar make this a gem. I would also highly recommend buying the New Wave of British Heavy Metal '79 Revisited compilation (a 2 CD set)."
2,Loss of view,"Man I really enjoyed the 1,2 books and had high expectations what a bomber!Buy If you are hopeing to feel Disappointed"
2,Where is this going?,"I really enjoyed the first two books in this series, but this thrid book seemed to be losing it's focus. I guess that I am getting tired of all of the weak characters continually playing the more prominent roles. I hope that someone will develop a sense of purpose besides whining about their problems."
3,"Good, but just a bridge","I always enjoy the intelligence and depth with which Elliott writes; but although I love a long series as much as the next guy, I become upset when I realize the ""novel"" I just finished was only setting the stage for the next book. It's an interesting story with many angles, but it shouldn't have been released until Elliott had A COMPLETED TALE! Prologues shouldn't be made to stand alone."
3,How long will this go on?,"When I first read King's Dragon I found this series rather harsh but, stuck in there out of sheer morbid curiosity, Prince of Dogs was better than the first and I had high hopes for The Burning Stone. However I find the cast of characters difficult to keep up with,the action scenes choppy, and the plot thin as gauze. The main heroine (if you can call her that) bounces around more than a rubber ball in this book and you aren't sure if you should be rooting for or against her. I think Kate should cut down on the number of characters and the number pages. I'm beginninng to think the bad guys should blow up this world."
3,Had Potential,"I just love Elliott's books! Okay, so I didn't really like this book in particular, talk about repeating things to the max! I believe this book should have deserved about 32 stars, but just because I loved all of her previous books, 3 stars is a must in a way. Oh well, maybe the next book will be better."
2,The Burning Stone,"The book is good, but at times it drags. There are points where I would have preferred more information and points where you just want here to get on with it. So far the whole mess with the Eika seems pointless, except to give them someone other than themselves to fight with. She gives just enought hints and clues to interest most people, but the true fantasy reader will find her frustrating to some degree. I would recommend the book, but I would be sure to warn people that it isn't the best work I have seen."
4,Not as good as the other two,"This book is not given five stars because it doesn't really go anywhere...sure there is action, but it's long and dragged out, and the whole 816 pages of it is very slow, only filling a gap between the last book and soon the next. I thought it didn't concentrate as much as I wanted on the characters I fell in love with in the first two books, and there is really no problem they get anywhere near solving. The story is pretty good, but I liked the other two better--I've always liked Kate Elliott's style and I can't wait to read the next one!"
2,Some witty moments...,"""Irish Tenure"" has some witty moments, but they are few and far between. As a matter of fact, the wittiest part of the book is the title! (Irish Tenure--tenor. Get it?) The puzzle centers on a long-lost story of G.K. Chesterton, and the political faculty catfights of academe. There are some dry little jokes scattered about, and some clever puns, but not much in the way of plot to involve us or characters to care about. In the end, it is a relief to put the book down. To phrase the final words of Ralph McInerny, ""It's the only tenure that matters."""
1,Irish Bore,I saw a copy of this book at the library and thought I would give it a chance. I didn't even get thirty pages into it. Irish Tenure has virtually no plot whatsoever and it rambles until the murder happens(almost 100 pages into it!). I won't read this series again.
3,Turn Up the Volume.... Please,Like the USB plug in feature but wish someome else had mentioned how limited the volume is....Okay for a very small hotel room only!
5,Altec Lansing XT1 Laptop Speaker System,"WOW what sound comes from these wonderful little Speakers. The case is nice as well. I highly recomend these for movie watching, Music and even using Skype with a mic. Very good product!!!"
2,Style and USB suppot is good,"However, the sound quality is lacking even though I had it installed on Creative's Audigy Laptop sound card. I was not happy with the sound at all."
3,Great Speakers but...,"If you are seeking portable speakers that can deliver decent sound and a eye catching add on this are the speakers for you, they sound very well but if you would like bass power and clarity you should try perhaps a 5.1 speaker set...Fast delivery from amazon, the box and the case of the speakers are beautiful and very stylish, the cable kit is very impressive and they are very easy to use, but remember if you want power this are not for you..."
1,Poor workmanship and support,"I was initially very pleased with these speakers. The sound was quite good, and they are portable (very light with a nice hard case).However, at about 1 year, they started malfunctioning. I couldn't get them to keep producing sound. I called the company and was told that this is a known issue with the speakers, and to return them. However, I got them as a gift and didn't have the receipt. They said they could not take them without the receipt.So, I am stuck with malfunctioning speakers!BUYER BEWARE"
2,"Volume..., please!",Reasonabley light and somewhat compact....For the money I had quite high expectations.What has really disappointed is the lack of volume. Hardly worth toting around! Is it just my particular set?Would not recommend ! Sorry!
2,The volume sucks,"I bought these speakers about 4 years ago when they came out for $150.The sound quality is good but they are barely louder than the laptop speaker itself.If you like loud music then these are not for you.They also have the option of getting a big bass tower from altec lansing for an extra $50. Even with the boom box they are not loud enough.On the upside,they are very sturdy.You do not have to worry about dropping them.The case is pretty nice and it comes with lots of attachments.All in all I would say these speakers are fair at best."
3,Don't stand properly,"These speakers are definately better than my laptop's but it does'nt stand properly. I had to stick it onto the wall because it kept falling over; so annoying. Anyway I need more power so I'm shopping for a subwoofer for no luck though. If anyone knows of a compatible woofer for this please holler at me, thanks"
2,"Very portable, but poor sound quality","Very small and light, no power cord needed... that's what sold me. However, when I tried them out, I discovered very poor, distorted sound - even at lower volumes. I'll live with headphones if I'm not near an oulet, if it means settling for these. I'm returning them - they're nowhere near as good as the basic Harmon Kardon speakers that came with my HP Pavilion laptop."
2,"Junky sound, inferior to competition","I just bought these to compare to my pair of V20s, and they just suck in comparison.The Bass is non existent in comparison, and the highs and mids sound absolutely tinny. Any sort of Equilizer work resulted in immediate distortion.I'm usually a fan of Altec Lansing products, but...These look nice and are compact, but the sound is not good, at all. The fact that they are more expensive than the competition is just appalling..."
1,Crap Speakers just as bad as MacBook Pro's Crap Speakers,These external speakers were supposed to make watching movies on my MacBook Pro sans earphones more bearable. The middle-range volume coming out of these speakers barely rose above the MBP's own speakers! So I turn it up louder and what happens? Crackling. I really wish these had worked out for me. They even matched my laptop! :(
1,"Beautiful to look at, not worth listening to","I do corporate presentations, teach & play back interviews.Packaging, carrying simplicity outstanding.Sound, based on plug into mac g4 laptop gave worse sound thanif I used computer alone.Annoyed that Amazon return cost me $ & time.Recommend you find separate power source for mini speakers."
3,Average sound,Very well constructed and packeged. I found the sound to be par with all other compact speakers I tested. The selling point was the packaging/design/value.
4,Awesome Speakers!,I love these speakers for travel since they have a nice case. My only complaint is that they do not stand up well - always falling over. The sound is excellent and I am happy with te purchase overall.
2,Raw Sylk...no Pure Trash,"I purchased this album back when it first came out--I don't remember why exactly. Eight years later--while putting together a women in hip hop presentation for a music class--I discovered the cd in my archives. Never having listened to it(except for Romeo & Juliet), I popped it in the Cd player, and discovered that this chick is garbage. Don't get me wrong the girl does have lyrical potential(although she fails to execute it here) but she is seriously lacking in all other aspects of music developement. I mean, who wrote the hooks to the songs. She kept talking about how she was going to blow up--she was right, because I am going to pour the gasoline on the disk personally. The only song that was decent on the album was the first single, Romeo & Juliet, but I don't think she knows that they killed themselves at the end of the story, or maybe she did, because this listening experience made me want to die."
2,Boring!,"This book is so incredably boring. The only reason I gave this book 2 stars insted of one is because it was the final book in the Hatchet series and I would never have to read any of them again. Absolutly nothing happens in this book that is woth actually reading, and taking up you time."
2,Brian's Return,"nonfictionBrian's ReturnBrian's Return is a disappointment! Gary Paulsen is a excellent author, but he could of done a better job for this book. This wasn't his best writhing. The beginning of this book was very boring, because he is in his home town telling how boring it is to be in town. Brian finally figures out that he likes the woods better and it makes him free. He wants to get permission to go back to the woods and live there. When he finally gets the permission the permission to go back, he has to find a why out there. An airline will drive when to 1 island and Brian's has to row his way to three other islands. He rows to one island a day and has to find his own food.The sequels to Brian's Return are Hatchet, The River, and Brian's Winter. Gary Paulson is the author of the best selling novel of the year ""Brian Winter"". This book is very adventurous at times. I thought it would like Hatchet ,but it wasn't even close. I think that's way I didn't like it."
2,borrrrring,"i got to say i've seen much better from gary paulson, i was very surprised to see this book. It didnt end, like his other books did. and didn't use the description i've come to know and love. It Stunk!!!"
3,mysticism beyond survival,"The fight scene is informative as to how the atitude of having to kill for survival can bleed over into inapropriate areas. The List of equipment Brian takes back into the wild is usefull. How he describes both the beauty of the woods as well as his restlessness in the city is good. His differentness in what he cares about is also informative.However, the book is essentialy a mysical journey. While Brian is Thankfull, I wonder to whom he is thankfull. What spirits guide him?"
2,Boring,It was very hard to understand and did not get my interest. I really did not enjoy the plot- boring.
5,AWESOME BOOK,it has an interesting snag. it hook line sinker to me. i recommend this book to 9-15 years of age
4,The inevitable ending to the Brian Saga,"We all knew it was inevitable--Brian would return to live in the wild. I've used this book as a read aloud for two years now with over 100 8th grade students. They have enjoyed it, but not nearly as much as they loved Brian's Winter. If you've started Hatchet, then by all means read the series all the way through, but know Brian's Return will be a bit weaker than all of them except The River."
4,A fitting end,My son and I have been reading Gary Paulsons books since we found Hatchet by accident. We really enjoy them and find that even if they do tend to repeat some events that each is new and exciting. I will miss Brian and have high hopes that maybe in 5 years Mr Paulson will write about Brian and where he is in his life at that point.. HINT HINT
3,Brian's Return,"Brian's Return his nothing compared to the Hatchet, the River,and Brian's Winter. I thought Brian's Return was too short and Ididn't get a feeling of closure. What happens is Brian has return tothe city and regular city life. He hates TV's because he thinks it took so much away from his thinking. Sports and vidoe games seem silly to him, pale in comparison to what his real life had been like int woods. He also can't get into sports and games, because he couldn't believe in them. Then Brian gets into a fight with a fellow student and is sent to a blind former cop for counseling named Caleb. Brian tells Caleb of his experiences in the woods and he starts to miss the woods. So then Brian decides to go back to the Canadian woods and stay with the Smallhorns. If you want to know what happens to him during his journey through the woods, you have to read and find out for yourself. I would reccomend this book to people who enjoyed reading the Hatchet, the River, and Brian's Winter."
4,Brian's Return,I liked it when Brian was on his first day back in the woods. He saw a Whitetailed doe come to the lake and drink from it. I can just imagine that scene in my head. I didn't like parts of the book when he was in the woods because it was sort of like the other books about Brian. I would reccomend this book to kids who have read the other Brian books and want to read more about Brian and to kids who are fans of Gary Paulsen's other books.
4,More Brian,"If you like this series you will enjoy the book. Unlike my expectations, the book does not dwell on his immediate return and reunion with his mom and dad. But except for that one negative, the book is very interesting and enjoyable."
3,Brian's Return,"Now that Brian is back to civilization he is trying to make sense of his High school life. He is having a hard time dealing with his peers and thinks about his days in the wilderness. He was once very well known for being a kid who survived and now all that has worn off. Going back into the wilderness, maybe Brian can find his true identity.I would recommened this book to people who love survival books."
2,a repeat of the books hatchet and brians winter,I like reading Gary Paulsons books but they keep repeating things like getting attacked by bears and having to hunt and fish for food. If you have either read hatchet and/or brians winter it gets very repitive.
2,Not as good...,This book...is not even close to Hatchet. It's really obvious that Gary Paulsen wrote this book in a hurry and didn't have time to put in a lot of detail. It's a lot shorter and has too much space.
1,Brians Return,THe Book is called Brians return it is the second book of the others. The author is Gary Paulsen. To me it is a realistic fiction. At the begining brian is found abd brought back home. Later a kid attacks him but brian defends himself and beats him up. Later he realizes he needs to go back to the forest because he forgot something and he wants to stay there becuase he thinks he only has the woods in him. He thinks he cant lve like a normal boy like he was before. I thought this book was a good book because it is something that might happen and it is a very good selling book. I would recomend others to read this book.
4,ordering a second one,I am ordering a second one for a new dog. we have had our first one for almost 4 years and love it. It is more like dog furniture than a cage.The plastic bottom does wear out where the feet touch it so we have had to replace that once.
4,Nice pen - flimsy tray - great Amazon customer service:),"I love this pen. It looks really nice and is sturdy. It was pretty simple to put together. It has enough room for my dog to sleep, eat and play a little. My only complaint is the cheap black bottom tray. I wish it was made a little stronger. the first one that was shipped was broken. However, I called Amazon and as usual their customer service was outstanding. They sent a new one out immediately and arranged for pickup of the old one. <3 Amazon!! You don't get customer service like that at many companies these days."
4,"Pretty funny and worth the price, but could have been better","The ideas behind the book are pretty good, but the illustrations don't match the ones in Where's Waldo. They're a bit sloppier and with less detail (probably to get the book out while the issue was current). On the other hand, it did take me a long time to find bin Laden in some scenes. The humor made the purchase worthwhile, but I won't elaborate... you'll have to buy the book to find out."

5,Suzanne is in a class of her own!,"This book is so awsome, I did'nt want it to end. Once you start you can not put it down. It feels like you've been warped back in time to a heart pounding, beautiful, excitng place you wont want to leave. I've read plenty of romance novels this ranks in my top five! I would like to read other of Barclay's novels although they are very hard to find."
2,just average!,"too much said in advertisement, too many promises but reality of this course is far not so bright as it was expected"
1,negative review by a teenager who dislikes required reading,"Personally, I hate this book. Not because it is bad, but because it's required reading and exceedingly boring. It's full of prases like The Golden Age of Diaspora Jewry and is very difficult to follow. I highly reccommend not reading it, unless you really love this sort of thing."
5,Buy This One First,If you have any band experience this is a must own album. Origionally available on vinyl it has made the transition to CD very nicely. I consider myself fortunate to have played many of these selections during my band career and this album brings back many great memories.If I were limited to only one album of march music this would be it.
5,"Excellent book, custioms tax shamelessly high","transaction was quicka and precise, book came in time, but I had to pay customs tax which is twice as high as book price. Amazom shoul find a way to send goods in Serbia on another way.Norse Mythology: A Guide to Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs"
3,Informative but...,I found this book to be very informative but somewhat dry readingA great book for research - not so good for general reading
5,Marty,I bought these for my husband and were the perfect fit. He uses them for work. They replace an old pair of Nunn Bush.
2,Review of Review,"While the book contains an egregious error, the most egregious of errors would be to use a single source to make life decisions. None of the retirement in Ireland books truly explicates the tax ramifications of retiring in Ireland. This book has useful information, but you had better do your homework fully first. Rule number 2, never use the exchange rate used in a book. Look it up."
5,We're ready to go!,My husband and I have been thinking about this for a while but we haven't had the time to do all the research. Thank God this author did it for me! What a great resource! We're baby boomers thinking about retiring in the next 5 years and this book will help us make our dream come true!
2,Not real useful,"The lamp rating of this light is something like 30 watts, not very bright unless you can find a reflector bulb that will fit, and the magnetic base, while it mounts firmly to a cast iron table top, doesn't hold on the thin sheet metal of a band saw's wheel covers, the most logical mounting place on a band saw. I find that I only use it on the drill press with its cast iron head."
5,Fun and insightful,"I am a grandparent as a parent.I found this book a fun, quick read.One ladies story of survival that can teach us all a few lessons.GPJ"
4,book review,"Interesting book. I thought it was a bit ""light"" due to being a grandparent raising grand children myself but the author pulled it together well at the end. Will recommend it to others in a similar situation"
4,Great Album from the Genius!,"Formidable ""first"" english album. Robi released ""Songbirds & Roosters"" (it was actually ""Frio"" with lyrics in English) before this album, but this was his first one being conceived & produced with the american market in mind. Reminds me of a ""Dream of the Blue Turtles""-era Sting during some of the songs. If you love this and want to get a better, deeper, more personal Robi experience, buy ""Vagabundo"", my favorite album of all-time."
5,"Someday, We'll Be Falling In Love Again","This is an amazing album! I had been searching for the song ""Do You Remember"" and when I found this CD, I knew I was going to like more of Robi Draco Rosa's songs. Indeed, I've been playing his CD over and over again. The artist captures a mixture of passion, love, melancholy, lament, anger, hope, desire, tenderness and more. If you've ever had an impossible love or want to know what it feels to have one, this CD will vividly paint the picture for you."
3,A very underated singer,"If you're like me, and was expecting something similar to Maggie's Dream or Rob's previous english cd, ""Songbirds & Roosters"", then you'll probably be a little disappointed. That doesn't mean that isn't a good cd, cause it is. It actually has a very cool,dark vibe to it that will probably wear well as time goes by.The cd starts out kinda smokey,jazzy and then goes on an interesting trip. Two of the songs, ""Heaven can wait"" and ""Try Me"" remind me of Lenny Kravitz, the rest is pure Robi.For me, the cd hits it's stride with the last 5 songs, ending with, in my opinion the best song on the cd, ""Mad love"". Really lush and grand. Let the song play on for about a minute after it ends, and you get an untitled/uncredited song that is cool and spacey, if not conventional. As I mention in the title, Robi's a great singer that unfortunately, hasn't been heard by enough people.I only gave it 3 stars because this cd doesn't quite rate (in my opinion) with the above mentioned cds."
5,Well worth the wait,"This will be the album that will finally prove to the whole world that Robi is more than a former member of Menudo and the songwriter of Ricky Martin's Livin La Vida Loca. Many of us knew that already, but now it's time for the rest of the world to discover this talented artist."
5,Amazing All In One,"This printer has been a pleasant surprise- I was skeptical at first to purchase since the reviews are all over the place.I used the printer to create my wedding ""save the dates"" and to print addresses on the corresponding envelopes. The lines are crisp, clear and very professional looking. Ultimately, this printer has saved me a lot of money compared to custom wedding stationary!Also, the scanner is quite intelligent. If you place multiple photos on the glass scan bed, the machine can actually detect each separate image, save it separately and ultimately save a lot of time.Very pleased with the printer and highly reccomend it."
1,A message from the future,"Today's date is Jun 7, 2006 but I will pretend I am writing this review in Jun 2007. If you read the reviews of any epson printer product made in the past 4 years you will know that they clog, so as I am writting this review in 2007 my once well rounded epson cx7200 inks heads have clogged. I am out of the warranty period. I cannot find a 800 number for epson. They have told me that I need to run a head cleaning, so I go out and buy some inks for 60 dollars, then I run the cleaning and still nothing happens, the printer still prints out blank pages. They say to run it again and again which I do. They have told me I need to purchase a new one (they offer me a discount off 10 dollars of their latest one) or have this one repaired. PEOPLE..... DO NOT BUY EPSON PRINTERS learn your lesson!"
2,USB cable not included by vendor,"Well, I can't really tell you what I think of the performance of this printer, because we just took it out of the box, were excited to test it out and print our first picture, and the USB cable to connect the printer with the computer (an odd one) is not included in the box! Why Epson do you annoy your customers like this? Is it really worth it for a few dollars worth of cable?"
1,CX7800 - overpriced with some serious performance problems,"I am presently looking for a printer to replace the CX7800 and am appalled to see what they are presently selling for....I got mine at Sam's for $69.99 about 3 or 4 years ago. I liked the separate ink tanks because my grandchildren love to print stuff so I use lots of ink. Right out of the box it refused to print a whole page - would print 1/4 or 1/2, then cut off the rest. Lots of banding problems, scanned documents have a big black bar right down the middle. Tech Support -- a joke. I limped by with it for this long. Now the window says ""Call for Service."" I have reinstalled with new cable, etc. etc. but needless to say, will not be calling for service. Stay away from this one."
2,This is an Ink Gobbling Cash Bandit,I rarely use a printer. Maybe 25 sheets or less per year and somehow I purchased this printer and all I ever do is pour money into it for ink that I don't even use.The ripoff with this printer is you MUST use 4 ink cartdiges and you cannot simply put in 4 black cartridges if you want. The printer will not function at all and forces you to buy more ink if you want to use it.I had no idea this was the deal or I would never have wasted my money.
1,Paper Jams,"I have found that this printer gets paper jams quite often. Then it jams and you get a code for service. Clearing the jam does not help when you get the service code. Have not had the copier very long.There have also been other print problems (partial characters printed, partial color or more than one color on characters.I had another Epsen printer (a model before this one) and it had exactly the same problems. It's now sitting in storage with a code saying to have it serviced. That was also brought on by a paper jam.Both of the above printers had the exact same problems, even though they were different models.I am not pleased with the quality of Epson printers. They look nice and perform ok for a few months, then start having problems.Overall, I have had 5 Epson printers. Not satisfied with any of them.I would highly recommend to avoid Epson printers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Ink Cartridges are a sore spot.,"Nice all around features EXCEPT, the ink cartridges frequently clog and have to be replaced way too often. If I had it to do all over, I would definitely not purchase this printer."
4,Epson - Good Value for the Money!,"We have the the all-in-one for several months--no problems yet! :)We do have the unit in computer desk and it is located on the bottom shelf--dark area--initially it was difficult to replace paper in the unit, but now that we understand how the guide slides operate we are fine--direction booklet was not very helpful in this area. Print quality is great and knocks out multiple pages fairly quickly! Happy with quality of copies too! Nice bright colors--have yet to use it for photos. Overall, we feel we made a good investment by buying this Epson Stylus CX7800 All-In-One"
1,No!,"I bought one of these in March '06, and it was dead by August. The replacement that the store gave me in August died in December. The store no longer sells the printer, so I got a refund. The quality of the prints was fine, but the problem was that the paper would not feed through the machine. It would pull the paper through on one side but not the other, resulting in constant paper jams. Extremely frustrating. In both cases, it finally got to the point where it would not feed paper through at all."
2,No Driver for Intel-based Macs?!,"Great printer/scanner--when it works. (The CX7800; I apparently wrote another review on the CX6000 page by mistake?!) Does suck ink... but I was able to print 150 full-color letter-size Xmas cards without replacing cartridges for another week afterwards. I am on my second CX7800--the first died after a simple paper jam. The current problem is: I have since upgraded from a Mac G4 to a MacBook Pro Intel-based laptop, and have spent HOURS installing/uninstalling re-downloading, resetting, restarting, etc. to make the recommended ""driver"" for this printer work, but IT DOES NOT SHOW UP!!! Now I wonder if it really even exists? Epson Support only repeats its same incomplete instructions without addressing the issue. I give up... and am on the lookout for a better solution from any OTHER company. Epson had its chances... and did not deliver."
2,Slow Printer with Inefficient Ink Use,"I have owned this printer for about two years. It hasn't malfunctioned yet, which I suppose is good, but also it hasn't wowed me with its abilities. It is an entry-level printer/scanner/card reader with few advanced features. It requires frequent preventative maintenance (print head alignment etc.). But the most frustrating facet of Epson CX-7800 ownership is just how inefficient it is with ink! Ink runs out frequently, especially black, and the replacements are expensive. Next time I'll buy an HP."
1,What a disappointment!,"Do not buy this printer! I spent hours working on a paper I need for class and then I tried to print it out...it's only text, black and white. My blue ink is out so I CANNOT PRINT!!!!! With the high price of their ink, I don't have a stock room of color ink sitting around since I generally only print text. HUGE DESIGN FLAW!!!! I will never buy another Epson!"
2,forget the photos,Printed 2 photos and took it back. Photos from sd card reader were grainy and the scanner photo was even worse
3,not the usual Gibbons quality,"I'm a Gibbons fan, so I snatched this book up when I found it. Sadly, I found it wanting. It seemed choppy to me as though two books, about the narator's life and her life with her abused aunt were clumsily connected to each other. The characters are well-drawn and the dialogue good, but overall the book is weak."
5,Something evil this way comes,"Something evil this way comes.There is something about a book that portends disaster and then gently lures you to observe the trecherous event. Kaye Gibbons has crafted such a beguiling tale of madness and redemption that I couldn't put it down.I wanted to,I couldn't stand to see Maureen slowly pulled towards the destruction her husband Troop seemed bent on delivering. Mary Oliver,Troop's 22 year old niece has entered the household so she can be a companion and help to Maureen as Maureen prepares to deliver the couple's first child.Mary is clear eyed and feels the heaviness in the air....and witnesses the malevolence in Troop's actions. She is determined to shield Maureen and her child from the madness that slowly reveals itself and threatens the household. This book was so well paced and so intriguing that I couldn't put it down.I wanted to avert my eyes but I was pulled in and had to know the outcome. A spellbinder!"
3,dont get an audio version of this book!,"I've read several other books by Gibbons and enjoyed them. I listened to this one on audio cd, and I have to completely agree with the reviewer who said Gibbons hire a reader. She often sounds like a schoolgirl being asked to ""read out loud"" with no interest in what the words actually are."
4,Wonderful read,"A wonderful read, interesting setting and characters that you feel you know and want more of. Highly recommended!"
2,Very Weak Book,"This is a pretty dismal book. The characters are one-dimensional and stereotypical, be they major or minor characters, and as a result, they are not interesting at all. In a book in which there is not much plot, the characters should be much more complex. The writing style in general is not bad, and does a decent job of evoking the tone of the early 20th century."
4,We HAVE Come a Long Way,"Unusual tale of the place of women in the United States in the early 1900's. An accurate understanding of male domination, manipulation, and control, expected, fostered and reinforced by US culture at that time in history. The strength of a young women coming into her own place in society and her impact on making change in the lives of others. Well written, interesting, thought provoking."
5,Strong Prose and a Wonderful Story!,"From the very first page of this book, I was entranced. I have read quite a few books by Kaye Gibbons but found this one on par w/ Ellen Foster in the strength of the voice of the narrator. There is humor, there is saddness, there are good characters and descpicable characters, the setting and events of the war era are well fleshedout..etc etc. I could go on. The novel is simply well written and well constructed. It reminded me of reading a more modern, and in many ways more satisfying, version of the Awakening by Kate Chopin.If you like Kaye Gibbons this is a definite must read. If you are unfamiliar w/ her work think of this as a very well written novel of women, their friendships and a period piece. Definitely highly recommend."
3,Hard to read,"I kept waiting for the story to begin. The settings and time period are well crafted. But the story is of an abused woman and her niece who supports her towards self empowerment. If the reader is in need of encouragement to leave a bad situation, this is a decent road map."
5,Enjoyable!,Kaye Gibbons was recommended to me and I found her to be an excellent &engaging author. I did not want to turn it off.
4,Divining Women,"This book was so good!!! I fell over laughing at some of the dialogue in here and because I am a Labor & Delivery nurse, I was compelled to recite to my fellow nurses at the nurses station the part of the book where the aunt recounts how her husband planned for her to have a hysterectomy because it was the cause of all the emotional turmoil that he thought she was going through.... and the other treatments that he had subjected her to: shock treatment, vaginal fumigation, etc. We were all on the floor with laughter at the silliness of it all. What she needed no doubt was a divorce from her crazy, overbearing, spouse!! I truly enjoyed this book."
2,Very disappointed,"I have loved all of Kaye Gibbons' books, and couldn't wait to get my hands on Divining Women. Started reading it immediately, and just could not get into it for about two years. I finally read it, and found it to be so one-dimensional that I would never recommend it. Such a tragedy too, because there are morsels of gold scattered here and there, which actually kept me reading and hoping (and laughing). But I honestly didn't care too much one way or the other whether Maureen stayed or left. And Troop was too much; too unbelievable, too pompous, too rediculous."
2,Dry and shallow,"Matt Braun is my favorite western author. His ability to bring the likes of John Hardin and Dr. Holiday back to life within the pages of his books is amazing. It is/was in that spirit I ordered this book.Dakota is about the time Theodore Roosevelt spent in the Dakota territory after the death of his first wife, the conflict between Roosevelt and De Mores and several incidents that occurred the Dakota's that would help form the man Roosevelt became latter in life.In short a time period that was full potential, adventure and historically available documentation. There was so much that Matt Braun could have done with this. Yet Roosevelt comes across as a caricature. He is never fully fleshed out nor was I ever even remotely drawn in to the man's being.It is a sad thing that Mr. Braun was not able to bring Theodore Roosevelt to life as he had done with other characters."
3,This cd is short but is pretty good,"This cd has only 6 songs, but it a pretty good complimation. Both the bands sound good together on a cd."
3,Good concept,I like the concept of this bag - but I must say that it is not very practical if you have larger breasts. I was never able to get it to sit comfortably around my breasts without it moving around too much or being too tight. I have used it on occassion though for quick trips and it was great for our visits to Europe when we just wanted a small bag for sightseeing outing. In general though I think a backpack would work just as well. I am hoping with a 2nd baby on the way it may get more use.
4,use it for myself too...,"This bag is very useful, many pockets so everything is in order. Looks very cool, I sometimes use it for myself as aswell. The downside is sometimes it is hard to remember which pocket you put your stuff in. And it would be easier to use if it was symetrical so that I can carry it either on my left or right shoulder. But as a result I am glad that I have it :)"
3,second thoughts,"Initially, I love this bag and would have given it 5 stars, and it's true, so many people notice it. As my baby grows older, there are more things to carry, I am having a second thought. If you are going for a short walk, shopping, visitng a friend...this works great. But let's say going for a well baby check up, doctor gives you some paperwork, a few samples....you are out of luck. Many times when you have a baby, you just want to ""throw"" things into the bag and hurry, this bag will not allow you to do that. Think twice, this will be a great second diaper bag, I still recommend another one with more spaces."
2,2 ripped on me,"I love the style, the color, and the functionality, but I had one and the large pocket frayed and ripped. I returned it for another one and it did it again."
3,A little small...,"When my son was younger, probably up to 1 1/2, this didn't work at all because you (well we) need to carry a lot more things, like always diapers, wipes, change of clothes, toys to keep them busy, snacks, etc. So, I put it away for awhile. But now when we go out for a walk, or a quick bite and don't need to carry but one diaper and a sippy cup, a few toys, it should be okay. I use it for myself mostly on a bike ride;"
3,Not as I hoped,"When i saw this bag and read the reviews it sounded like the perfect bag. I did not want a huge bag that screamed ""diaper bag"". Although I love the look and the individual compartments were nice and it carried a fair amount for such a small bag I did have one big issue . . . it never ""fit"" me right when I wore it . . .I am a petite person (5'1"") and this may be why - the fabric seemed stiff and no matter how I adjusted it, it seemed like it was too long on me and too loose so it moved all around - I found wearing it to be quite annoying and ended up returning it."
1,Broke almost immediately!,"I was really hopeful about this diaper bag when I ordered it through Amazon. The size is small and convenient, but I found it awkward when placing it around my arm and neck. Also, the clasp broke after I had it for only 2 weeks! I am really disappointed, and would recommend looking elsewhere for a diaper bag."
5,What a find,"What a find! I have owned many cameras, but this model is fantastic! For a casual user, my families vacation, new baby, and leisure shots are remarkable (Note: I have only used fugi film, rather than other brands, and truly believe that the quality photos are due to the fact that cheap film is not being used). This product is well worth the money!! As for the other reviewer having problems with loading film, I have experienced this, however, if you result to the directions, you are only supposed to place the tip of the film in the loading department, my problem was that I placed to much film, and it wouldn't advance, I have not had a problem in 2 years."
2,Radical behavior,"Radical terrorism. Some disturbing scenes of protesters and vandalism.It's unfortunate that people are pressured to take extreme measures like the ones reported on here.Capitalism is not ""evil"". Corporations are not ""evil"".People are typically greedy and mean. It's easy to blame to assuage frustration. Scapegoats.Godlessness. Read Romans 1.This film is sympathetic to the activists. It's not really fair or balanced. A lot of angry libs will watch this and feed their self-righteous loathing of ""the system"".If you somehow believe that G Bush was a terrorist, take a hard look, after you sober up, at Obama and all the raving hate-filled negros in political office and running the streets as Black Panthers in America."
3,clasp too small,"I really like the chain itself, very pretty and no nickel.... and I specifically did not want a lobster claw clasp. However this clasp is a bit too small for me. It is difficult for me to use."
1,Too small and did not work,"The product was much smaller than I anticipated. When it did not work, I sent it back and purchased another type of barometer. However, my contact with the company was very satisfactory as was the contact with Amazon. I got my refund immediately."
5,A Mystical Doorway into the Heart of Nature,"The album is uplifting to the spirit and deeply felt in the soul.The depth of emotion behind the music, catching melodies, and brilliant prose make it the cd that I choose when I want to tune in to the pulse of the ancients. I highly recomend this album as a relaxing, interesting, and inspiring work."
5,An Essential Read!,"I'm not sure this book needs much of a review. Most folks who have gotten this far are probably already predisposed towards buying this book anyway. Other reviews of this book treat the book exactly the way Mills has covered the subject matter. I will not be as eloquent. This book is quite simply the most truthful book ever written on the subject. ""The Racial Contract"" should be required reading for everyone that can read. Its message is not finger pointing, or condescending in tone. It is not apologetic at all. It could be a wake up call for Eurocentric civilization... if it is read!"
4,'SOCIAL CONTRACT THEORY - DEMOCRAT PARTY,"Racism ~ Social Contract Theory. Who implemented this theory? Here is some interesting history: Democrats in this country formed the KKK, also planned parenthood aka N.O.W. aka Maria Stopes International; was(kick started by Margaret 'Eugenics' Sangar)and Democrats fought hardest to keep slavery intact. Don't buy in to fabricated history. Democrats also caused reverse Racism and distrust against Conservatives. Conservatives are the Abolitionist's of history."
5,Best H.323 book on the market,"This is by far the most comprehensive book on the market. I agree with the previous review, IP Telephony with H.323 is for advanced uses and a great reference guide as well. I highly recommend it if you want a thorough understand H.323 and IP Telephony, however, if you wish to learn about a particular subject, for example QoS or MPLS, this book will not provide enough detailed information (check out Cisco Press).Must buy!"
4,Talented twins...,"I almost forgot about this group. To find 2 sets of twins that can sing...what a great combination. I liked this cd, with ""Reality"" and ""Medicine"" being my favorite tracks. Too bad they got caught in the myriad of 90s girl groups."
3,What happened to Elusion?,"I was digging through my closet, and lo and behold, I found my long lost and forgotten Elusion cd. I popped it into my cd player and listened to my favorite track, ""Reality"".The album is average, mostly filler, with only 2 good songs, ""reality"", and ""how can u"" which samples the beat from tina turners ""whats love got to do"". What ever happened to these girls? They're so beautiful, 2 different sets of gorgeous twins. Its been 5 years since they came out in 1995. I hope they come out with another album together."
4,very nice,"I am wondering like everyone else, what happened to them? I first saw them on soul train and there performance was spectacular. I went right out and bought the CD. I mis placed it during a move and have been trying to find it every sense. If anyone happens to know what happened to them drop a review and let me know."
3,yeah where is the follow up?,i thought they was the next best thing.but after one good video nothing.over all this is a above average album.plus its kinda short.but where are they?.i guess we have a semi one hit wonder.RCA bring them back!!!!!!.oh and these girls are super fine.
5,Excellent product and service,I already owned a couple of these stands. So I already knew of their quality.They are very strong and well built. The company that sells these must ship these 5 minutes after you order them. I had mine the next day. You cannot beat that kinda service.So 5 stars for the product and 5 stars for the service.
1,"Wrong stand for 9"" Band Saw","Directions provided with stand describe mounting 8"" and 10"" band saws. Front page includes28-180 8"" Band Saw 28-185 8"" Band Saw 28-160 10"" Band SawDoes not include 28-150 9"" Band Saw. Haven't found a set of holes that match up. Stand will not mount saw using 4 bolts as required."
3,réédition d'urgence,"Note pour universal : au lieu de rééditer les CD du sempiternel Pavarotti, rééditez d'urgence les disques de Gina Bachauer ainsi que le reste des CD de Mercury Living Presence qui menacent de disparaitre faute de réédition. Merci d'en prendre note et de faire le necessaire. Ces disques ne doivent plus quitter le catalogue, sous aucun prétexte."
1,Not really anything good here at all.,"This album has very few good points on this album. This album is mostly Old School Punk, but it isn't good at all. Unless you are really into the late 80's punk rock, which really isn't punk at all. So, I recommend you really don't waste your money"
5,Justo Betancourt's masterpiece...remastered.,Many thanks to Emusica Records (Fania's new owner) for reissuing and properly remasteriong this landmark album on CD. Whereas the previously available Cd was transferred directly from an LP record this new reissue was made from the original masters--with much better sound quality on all ten tracks. This was the album that made Justo betancourt a Salsa superstar--and one that shall remain a classic...forever. Buy it now if you don't yet have it!!!
5,Wny nobody don't talk 'bout CB no 'mo?,"It's hard to imagine 'cuz I been a fan of his since day 1 (1990 or '91). And I still believe he could be the most-talked about rappers in the world of hip-hop history. Period. Ya'll may realize he is definitely the Barry White or Biggie Smalls of Hip-Hop. This cat got skillz. That's my dad's fav. rapper. Mostly I call him my man for instance.For fans to ""The One"", ""Treat 'Em Right"", ""Just the Two of Us"", ""The Big Man"",etc. must gotta have this if they're fans to the Notorious B.I.G., Heavy D & The Boyz, Guerilla Black (the West Coast sound of Biggie), B.B. Jay (a Christian rapper homage to the gospel sound of Biggie), to name a few. I recommend u buy @ least any of Chubb Rock's albums including this 1 and tell me whad'dya think. Peace."
4,you will not be disappointed,"Supposedly Chubb was a pre med major going to college at one point. goes to show. his word play is perfect, he's smart and worldly. anyone on hip hop knows Chubb Rock is a master!"
5,Right on target!,"Over 300 pages of saucy tales from the Masters of Genre. Nobody's as sexy as a man in uniform, especially if he's one in Raw Recruits!"
3,About the silliest thing ever,"Somehow, they've taken all the idioms of the kung fu genre: the struggling students, the secret masters, the hidden rivalries, gang lords, and good triumphant in the end. Then, all that is grafted onto some kind of parlor game, as complex as bridge but played with elaborate dominoes.The result is the perfect kung fu movie, minus the fights, choreography, scenery, sets, action, and plot, but with overacting to compensate.But I mean that in a nice way - I think.-- wiredweird"
2,2thdoc,"I expected more. This product is very home-made, lacking professional appearances. It is very, very basic and presents positions, strikes, blocks and parries in very simple form, and that's good. But I had hoped for it to take me at least a small step further--into perhaps a kata or two in which I could use these forms. It presents only the ""alphabet"" and has not taught me to make a ""word"" or speak a ""sentence"". Please forgive the metaphor."
5,"Affordable as a gift, and small enough to pack for a trip.","A remarkable life sketch of the famous saintly priest,who bore the stigmata, or wounds of Christ.Padre Pio died in 1968.He possessed the gifts ofcelestial perfume,bilocation, andreading of hearts."
1,One star is too much for this book!,"I took a class and was required to read this book. It was the worst book I have ever HAD to read! I struggled to finish the reading assignments. This book was so biased I couldn't believe it. Once again America is the root of all evil, and the white man is the devil. The authors need to take another look at America, and see that there is some good going on here! Only someone that is so miserable and bitter would believe (or write) this book. They had nothing good to say about America...if it is so bad here, why don't they move (and take along anyone that agrees with them)."
3,It's Ok,It's Ok. But a bit slow but some bits are very funny. I have not finished watching it yet. I got bored.
5,I wouldnt use anything else,"I have 4 guitars, all with Planet Wave auto trims. Never a problem with any slipping or strings breaking. The gear ratio makes tuning a breeze. 5 ***** I wouldnt use anything else"
1,"Neat Concept, Poor Execution","I put a set of these tuners on a Gibson SG less than a year ago. Cool idea; straightforward string locking mechanism and built in cutter. They look very nice, too. However, right from the get-go the tuner for the high E string would often let it slip. I ended up using multiple wraps around the post just like a standard tuner to make it hold. Minor aggravation. Now, within the last month, two of the tuners have broken. Yes, I play strings that are a little heavier than usual, and I do a bunch of string bending. Still, for what these things cost and the hype, I expected more. I ended up replacing these with Wilkinson tuners for a LOT less money. The Wilkinsons have two holes at 90 degree angles through each post. It results in a very simple, yet very effective string locking system. And the Wilkinsons are very well made. I took one apart before deciding to use them on my guitar, and was surprised and impressed at the quality of the components."
3,"Tuners are great, screws in box are terrible","Nice set of tuners defeated by two cents worth of cheap metal screws. I predrilled a telecaster headstock with pilot holes and STILL managed to break a screw installing these. Took me a lot of effort to get the screw fragment out, and I tossed the remaining screws fro some nicer stew mac screws. Very frustrating. Tuners themselves work really well, but the CHEAP SCREWS are awful."
2,Unfulfilled Title and Story,"This entry in the new genre of ""fly fishing and the meaning of life"" breaks no new ground; not interested in sibling rivalry and the author's fascination with drinking. In fact, it sheds no light on fishing nor on being a man in the 21st century."
2,The road to boredom,"A question mark hovers over the autobiography written before, say, the age of forty. Maybe the same short of suspicion should exist when someone writes, about fly fishing before the ink is dry on first license. But then again, what if it was a really good book? We will have to wait to test that out - this is an awful book.What's it about? Fishing, life, philosophy? Who cares, my brain hurts hearing his Philosophy 101 approach molded to a new subject. That's Kingwell's gift, he's the talking head they call, in Canada, when a news subject requires some tedious philosophical pandering. Yes, you will find this all immensely edifying - if this is the first book you have ever picked up.For someone who is looking for some philosophy and fishing, consider Fishing and Thinking by A.A. Luce. A little old fashioned, Fishing and Thinking is nonetheless worth the time."
2,a glimpse of life...,"The shortest glimpse at a life worth living and the author, Kingwell is so inspired he decides to write a book about it. Somewhere between the weakish rants about the wearing of baseball caps and the somewhat self-aggrandizing culinary tid-bits, Kingwell displays the too prevalent concept of fly-fishing as a fashionable sport, ie, a sport of fashion.He comes across as a pansy that wears a cell-phone whilst fishing, is basically what I'm saying I guess. He attempts to display his own renaissance-man activities and proclivities and demonstrates, instead, the type of guy you pray to god is not on the river when you are, and how this type of guy spends his ""free-time."" I wouldn't be surprised if he owned a beret or two."
5,Gestation of Darwin's Origin,"This is actually one of the better studies of the gestation of Darwin's theory from his early travels and researches from the 1840's to the publication of Origin. The author brings out the way in which Darwin's thinking crystallized before he had the foundations of knowledge to put forth his thesis, and his hesitations, doubts, and uncertainties are clear from the record. In fact, the lack of evidence for his thesis was central to his difficulties. He was forced to argue not so much for the correct theory as the least objectionable one. And in fact, among other reasons due to the prodding of his sudden competitor Wallace he was forced to publish too soon. Lots of interesting details from Darwin's notebooks, a useful and cogent study."
2,I just don't get Mark Turner...,"I appreciate understated playing, but it has a time and place, and Turner never seems to leave that place. With Grenedier and Ballard blasting out propulsive rhythms, it almost becomes comical how Turner seems to sleep over the top of them throughout this album. You take a Potter, or a Carter, or a Redman and they'd be in the frey ripping it up. Which is not to say that Turner needs to sound like anyone else, but his playing, on this album in particular, makes him sound tentative and not really at home in a trio format. I think you need a far more dynamic player to pull a sax trio off. My two cents, anyway..."
1,Worthless,Stopped working after a week. Vendor was Tiger--they refused any type of refund. Amazon couldn't help either. Might as well toss the cash out the window.
4,Good price for the functions,"I just got mine yesterday. I tried music and FM radio functions and they seem fine to me. The sound quality is not bad. I agree the control is little bit hard but is still acceptable. Think about $20 for a 1GB Mp3/FM radio/voice recorder, it is a good deal. Only not sure how long it will last."
1,2.5 of these have broken so far,"I bought two of these, and within a year both had broken. I was able to get a replacement for one of them, but recently the USB connection on the new one stopped working. Now I can play files, but can't change what's on the player.Even before the players broke I wasn't very fond of them. The battery life wasn't anywhere near 10 hours, and the toggle switch has a weird sensitivity -- I was constantly over or undershooting the mark with it. The voice recorder worked okay when I spoke directly into it.Of course, the low price is pretty impressive for all the features. If only those features actually worked!"
1,The flash drive doesnt get detected at all.,The flash drive doesnt get detected at all. The customer service of CENTON doesnt respond. I wish i could get the replacement.Thanks..
3,First mp3,I'm over 50 and this was my first experience with Mp3 player. The directions were for someone who knew how to use this item. I't goes through a battery in about 2 hrs. I had to get an 18 yr. old to show me how to work it. For the cost it's okay nothing impressive. You get what you pay for.
1,Mala compra!,"No se te ocurra malgastar tu dinero en este MP3, hay muchos otros MP3 a la venta, mas pequeños y de mejor calidad por no mucho mas dinero. Es muy complejo de usar, el software es sencillamente de mala calidad y los audifonos para nada buenos. Incluso el acabado y los botones no son tan buenos. En general una mala compra."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is extremely hard to use and confusing. Mine came without instructions. I accidentally pressed the ""hold"" button and have never since managed to get it off hold."
2,Two outta three ain't bad,"I purchased three of these as Christmas presents. My eight-year old loved it...until she realized the lanyard clip didn't work (we then used a twist tie to hold the lanyard on), the key ring thing broke, and then the player stopped playing altogether! She did not abuse this in the least. We returned it for a refund. The other two are still working fine but don't get nearly as much use. I also recommend buying a rechargeable player, as this one eats batteries. We replaced my daughter's player with a ZenV by Creative, which I highly recommend."
2,Firmware locked up,"The player worked for about a day and a half before the firmware locked up. Right now it will turn on and you can scroll through the songs, but as soon as the play button is pushed the player locks up and the only thing that can be done is to turn it off or pull the battery. I've got an email into the company now to see if anything can be done to reset it or fix this glitch. I've been waiting a couple of days now due to the holidays. Hope it gets resolved soon. It was good while it worked. My daugher was happy with it."
2,Does not live up to spec,"It claims to hold 1 GB, and thsi is so, but it can only actually fit 512k of mp3s in the file that plays back mp3s. It was a firmware limitation. Other than that it's cheap, and has nifty features. But the short battery life is a bummer."
1,Don't buy!,"The device does not keep tracks in proper order. A new AAA battery will be drained when uploading music. A new AAA battery will be drained when left in the product overnight, in the off position.Horrible costumer service. Just an email address, no phone contact. Looks like a shop out of someones NYC apartment.Waste of money!"
3,If only it had louder volume.,"It's fun to use your mp3 player as a key chain, but a few things to know. First, the headphones crackled right out of the box (Cheap?). I just recently dropped my keys and the glass broke on the front. The volume of the music is quiet at max volume. The software really isn't needed to drag/drop songs to the ""drive"" which is a plus. Other than that, a great toy."
2,Doesn't quite work,"Not only does the plot and motive make no sense, but many of the actors overemote as if they were still on a stage. The rest of it is just plain preachy and annoying."
4,Very underrated album,"I was pleasantly surprised when listening to this album. For some reason, the album cover and title lead me to think this was a jazz album, which was Barretto's preference. This release featured the very underrated Ray de la Paz on vocals with a very good performance. The album includes solid tracks like ""Manos Duras"" a tribute to the king of the congas which to me, is the second part of ""Fuerza Gigante."" ""Indiferencia"" and ""Amor Artificial"" are romance songs with unbelievable swing and then there's ""Mi Dedicacion."" I struggle to chose a favorite between ""Manos Duras"" this song (Mi dedicacion) an excellent tribute to Puerto Rico and Barretto's self proclaimed home. This track is salsa dura at it's best. I wasn't really seeking out this album, but I'm sure glad I found it. Definitely a great addition to anyone's collection."
1,NOT Crystal Litter,"This is not crystal litter, which is what I wanted. I noticed that others have said the same, but I did not notice these reviews at the time I bought the litter or I would not have bought it. I think the advertising should be pulled and more truthful advertising inserted. I normally use crystal only litter and this is some type of clay litter with micro crystals added. I am going to have to scoop liquid and solid, which I do not want. I had to use it because I was totally out of litter and I trusted Amazon. Mistake!"
3,Crystals litter,"A goood product, but not my favorite. I prefer more crystals than sand; actually prefer ALL crystals products for this purpose with an ease of maintenqnce and clean-up."
2,Gummy and Hard to clean,"This litter is gummy. It sticks to EVERYTHING! The scoop, the bottom of the box is a gummy goopy mess every time I clean it. Cleaning takes longer than it should because of this. I had used this several years ago and it was great, but I think in the effort to get it to clump harder they have made it more difficult."
1,Not what it looks like in the picture. It supposed to be blue crystal litter and it is grey garbage. I cvalled the company and t,"I received this item I or according to the picture it supposed to be bllue crystals not grey gravel. I called the company and said send it back. I am going to pay to have it shipped back. It going to be alot of money to ship it back. They also say it is not their fault, but it is the manufacture. Well they sell it. It is garbage and it does not look like the picture on Amazon. Garbage. It is the color grey like regular gravel would. They are desiving the customer. Terrible."
5,The best option out there (period),"I've looked at a bunch of the services out there (frontpage, bbedit, etc), and Homestead is by far the best option available. Their software is *very* easy to use, and it lets you build a site that almost any web designer would be proud of. The only things you can't do are custom flash presentations, but who needs that ? Within a few hours, you can have your site up and running.The best part of Homestead is that they include the hosting, domain name and e-mail addresses all in one package for a very reasonable price."
5,Homestead,The fast way to build a cheap web page and effective! Anyone that wants the world to know them or their company should consider this a cheap way to work. You save on the web designers fees as well and you can do it WITHOUT HTML!!
2,Homesite Professional,"For beginners this is a good program, but for more advanced users - who like to get in, modify, and have the site reflect those modifications - it feels like wading through quick sand. Plus, if you ever hire a competent web-developer to make modifications to the site, it's actually going to cost you more because (s)he will need to use Homestead to modify the site."
2,Did not age well at all.,"After reading about Suzanne Ciani in Analog Days (see my review) and her important role in the early days of the synthesizer I picked up this, her first, album. It was disappointing to me that, although she had been making music forever, her first album would not appear until close to 1980. This means that her instruments are rather more modern than the original Moogs and Buchlas that I'd been expecting to hear. It feels to me like some essential history of electronic music went unrecorded.And then, considering that the instruments were so much more modern than the old Moogs and Buchlas, this album sounds paradoxically extremely dated. These are the Prophet V and Synclavier sounds that history has preferred to forget, I guess.Disappointing in many respects."
2,subpar Bloch,"This music is not on the same level as other music of his--such as his ""Ba'al Shem,"" which I've played. It just doesn't have the focus or the heart that I've associated with his better works. Some bright points, but not enough."
3,Miter Gauge,"Well, it makes the saw easier to use, but isn't pleasurable to adjust because it is hard to get perfectly parallel to the blade. It's not bad, but I guess it's your only option for ripping on this particular saw. Plus, it only works well with a razor-sharp blade."
2,Half-way decent fence for a lackluster band saw,"I bought this fence in hopes that it MIGHT improve the performance on my delta 8"" band saw. Aside from the face that the band saw is really poorly designed, the fence is just as clumsy a design. It is very stiff to move back and forth on the table and will move unless you tighten it alot. And if you do tighten it alot you have to be Hulk Hogan to push the locking clamp down. It is only about 2"" high. However since this is being used on a really bad saw to begin with, how could you possibly expect more."
4,"Delta 28-181 Rip Fence for 9"" Band Saw","This product does what most rip fences do. The only ""problem"" is that the table on the 9"" band saw has no rule so care must be taken to set the fence where you want it from the blade and making sure it is square to your cut.~RD"
2,"Delta 28-181 Rip Fence for 9"" Band Saw -- Not the Greatest!!","My experience with the #28-181 rip fence was disappointing, but the vendor Work Tough saw fit to refund my money after I explained problems with the product. The response was immediate, as was the refund. The vendor seemed to agree with my descriptions of out-of-square product, poor fit to the saw table, and a broken piece of potmetal on the front table guide!!"
3,Not a quality item,"I honestly think a board clamped to the work surface would take about the same amount of time to set up and do as good a job, if not better. The thing does not fit properly, even after following the instructions in the manual. Not too well designed, even if it is being used on a cheap bandsaw. I can ""get by with it and make it work"", but shouldn't have to. Too hard to stabilize and adjust.I do not recommend this product."
1,Used,I knew that this was going to be a less than great product but I did not expect it to be used. They didnt even bother to clean the sawdust out of it!
1,Don't buy,Fence was delivered yesterday. No directions on it's use and I can't make it fit securly to the table. I do not recommend it. Will be returning it for credit.
4,"Cute, but only sepia photos","I got this book as a gift for a dachshund lover. It's definitely cute, with a lot of great dachshund photos. It does have a good ""hot dog"" assemblage. However, all of the photos are black and white (actually, sepia-toned). It would have been nice to have a mix of color and sepia, especially as some dachshunds have different shades of brown. The book went over well with my family's dachshund-lovers, so I can definitely recommend it."
5,Dachshund Heaven!,A must for any dachshund lover! Beautiful photos of our beloved breed! Highly recommended for all weiner dog moms and dads! Great gift!
5,Dachshund note cards,Love these cards. Photos are great and envelopes/cards are made from heavy duty stock -- feel luxurious. Definitely will replenish my supply.
5,"Padres, pongan atencion!","Soy psicoterapista, y yo recomiendo mucho este libro a las familias con que trabajo. Este libro es esencial para cualquier persona que verdaderamente quiere encontrar la manera de relacionarse sanamente y con paciencia con sus hijos. Completo con caricaturas. Estudialo con su pareja. No hay dos como este libro."
1,This book is not interesting.,"This book is all about the author and the minor position he held in a historic event and little about the historic event. His bias is unmistakable and the book unremarkable and not well written.He (or his editor) used the incorrect word for a juror challenge on page 211, line 24 (preemptory instead of peremptory), a 1st year law student knows better. If someone will pay shipping I will send the book before I toss it in the trash but it is not worth the time I spent to read it."
5,AWESOME CD! One of the roots of hip hop.,"If you don't own this CD, you should. You'll laugh, you'll crym it will become a part of you!"
2,Warranty is not upheld by company.,"I have not had this screen this screen tent working for an entire season since I purchased it. A pole broke during the first season and a simple warranty replacement has now dragged on for three years. After shipping my poles cross country several times I was mailed back; 1) One pole that was the wrong size. 2) 2 pole that had the same visible construction flaws 3) Two poles over a foot short.In three years PaHa Que was unable to send me one ""NEW"" pole.The following is my suggestion if you want a high quality tent from a company thatEureka! Northern Breeze - Screen House"
4,Thank you Amazon Sellers!,"The book shipped with no problems. This book was ordered for my sisters because we had happened upon it about 10 years ago & had a real laugh, sense it was innocently read to my grandaughter in error (I wouldn't recommend it be read to children). For years I tried to find it. It was a hit as a Christmas gift for my 2 sisters. My grandaughter, who is a teenager now, got a laugh out of it too. No one could believe that I'd found 2 copies of it."
1,My mistake....,"So, I bought this book used, and thought it would be great for my 2nd grade class. Mistakenly, I read it to them without reading it first. This is probably the WORST children's book ever. The worst part? Everyone that committed crimes remain free, no consequences. Horrible."
1,judge for yourself,"A quick (and very true) recap of the story:A small rabbit named Jack hates that everyone calls him ""little bunny"" all the time. He collects many weapons (including a gun, several daggers, and a bow and arrows) and goes on a crime spree. He holds up a bank, but doesn't really want to hurt anyone just ""strike fear into the hearts of men and rabbits."" The police catch him, throw him in jail, and take away his weapons, which makes him cry. In jail, he finds a rabbit smaller than he and they escape together and live the rest of their lives in the mountains reading newspapers and eating chocolate and bubble gum.No judgement, no punishment, and no consequences.This is not a book I would ready to any child, nor any grown up for that matter."
4,Helpfull,"After 45 years building I have the knowlege that is in this book.I design build. I like and need time saving short cuts.I am way too busy to take time rememering a specific problem I solved several years ago so, having this book helps me visualize the perfect sollution without wasting time remembering and reinventing.It is well laid out."
4,Tons of space! A little boot noise.,"This drive gives a little more noise than my old 80gb Western Digital sata drive during the initial boot, but is pretty quiet otherwise. I'm a pc gamer so I need as much space as possible. I've been using an older 80gb WD drive for years and decided to upgrade. Seeing as I don't have enough money for a Solid State, I figured i'd look for the best value I could. This drive is definitely one for gamers or anyone that needs space for productivity, whether it be movie making, photography, digital animation you name it."
4,Hard drive met my expectations,The hard drive unit shipped was exactly as specified and performed well. The packaging was adaquate but could be improved.
1,Poor Accuracy,"I bought the saw as I very much liked the integral stand with wings, motor, and compound capability. Unless you plan to do only rough, and I mean rough framing, do not buy this saw. The presets are very sloppy. This saw has never met my expectations for accuracy. I have used no-name saws costing a third the price and obtained better results."
2,Disappointed with the Delta Sidekick,"Overall, I've been disappointed with the Delta Sidekick miter saw with the integral stand. Almost from day one, I have found pieces of the stand which have fallen off. The screw that the blade guard pivots on was not seated far enough and starting to wobble after a few weeks of use. This was an easy fix, though because I just replaced it with a longer screw. The next thing that happened was that the screw that holds the blade guard on (back and top of the saw) broke off rendering the guard unusable. I had to remove the blade guard which makes using this saw a little unnerving. I thought at the time of purchase I was saving myself a few bucks but you know the old adage - you get what you pay for!"
4,"Great Saw, Stand is in Question","I had recently been looking for a miter saw and compared various models. I finalized my choice based on Delta's reputation for producing good quality product. Secondly, I found the added stand a great deal based on cost. In finally getting down to using the Sidekick, I found it easy to use, with angle adjustments quite easy to use. With an 80 tooth blade this saw can certainly get detail work done with ease and precision. The stand, Hmm, the stand needs better locking mechanisms, so the legs cannot fold in on itself if accidently bumped. Overall, great saw, with a stand that needs more attention to detail."
3,Poor support,"I have a 10"" delta miter saw. I can not use my saw because the fence is broken and I can not buy a replacement. I am told you do not make this saw anymore but what about all the people who have bought this saw, use this saw everyday? What if they come up with a broken part. Instead of buying a replacement part we have to buy a new saw, this sounds fair. What ever happened to having parts on the shelf for a certain amount of years after you stop building a product?My replacement I was told would be about $30.00 bucks plus tax and shipping now I have to spend over $400.00 for a new saw.Did you look and see if the new saws you are building have any parts on them that might fit the older saws , I say older I bought this in mid 90s.Just a little upset"
1,This saw is garbage,There is nearly nothing about tis saw that i like. It has been constructed very cheaply with plastic parts falling off to major head flex. You will never get an accurate miter cut with this saw due to the excessive movement in the head. The positive stops barely work at all. Go with a Bosch or Makita.
2,"Good cutting saw, but not very durable","A cousin of mine bought this saw and we have had very good luck with it. Infact, I liked it so much that I went to buy my own. Well, my first saw came and after getting it out of the box I noticed the handle was cracked right where the handle meets the saw. I understand accidents happen in shipping so I sent it back. My new replacement saw came within 5 days. After I opened the box I noticed this saw was cracked in the exact same place! Even though the saw does perform quite well and is extremely portable I have to give it a pretty low rating since the plastic construction around the handle is not very well manufactured. I since went with the Bosch 10"" sliding miter saw. Very good saw and extremely durable. For the few extra bucks its worth it.. I hope delta re-engineers this saw to be compatible in quality with the rest of their products.."
5,""" IT'S ALWAYS BETTER LIVE!!!!""",One more CD from this group and live!! no better combination then that!!!!! I really recommend this particular cd/cds. If you love Primavera you will enjoy listening to the most recent hits -to the oldies but goodies!!!!! I guarantee it.......
1,Wrong Item no description and Picture,"I put in your search engine ""Verbotene Liebe"", and this item came back as the only choice. Forbidden Love is the english translation. So i thought must be the one with american substitles as this is a german soap opera. What i get is porno cartoon in a kind of anime form. So no, not satisfied at all."
3,Basic Rip fence,"Not a bad rip fence.. pretty light weight, Only attaches on one side of the table and you need to set it for the drift of the blade. It's not to bad though and it's better than nothing. I got it and I'd get it again if I didn't have it already."
4,Nice little fence,It is light and feels flimsy but I have been using to resaw 1x4 and it works well. The fence comes with a metal bar that attaches to the band saw table and allow the fence to tighten and stay 90 degrees to the table. I have to admit that when I took it out of the box I didn't think much of it but my opinion changed quickly when I started using it. There are better fences out there but you'll have to get a much more expensive band saw to go with them so in my opinion this is a good buy and a good value.
1,Rip Fence,"This was supposed to fit the 10"" Delta Bandsaw but no matter what I tried it would not work...so it just sits collecting dust...sux"
1,Invest Purchase Price Elsewhere,"As the reviewers say, invest the cost of this book in the stock market and watch your money grow. Buy the previous book and learn how to make money by working. This book reads like an expanded version of his research notes. Do not bother."
4,How is it different?,"When I started this book I wasn't clear how it would be much different than ""The Millionaire Next Door."" Soon it did become clear to me. This book set out to share ""economic success factors"" based on research according to the authors proven style. I found the read both entertaining and insightful. Well done again!"
4,Very insigthfull although somewhat dated.,This book is basically some enlightened research paper that has very powerful implications for everyday use.Although the data is more that 10 years old by now it is still relevant to today's realities. A real eye opener.Recommended for small business owners or anyone else that wants to be worth more than one million dollars in the near future.
1,A big Disappiontment,"I read Stanley's first book, The Millionaire Next Door, and while it wasn't great, I finished it. I thought that this second try was going to be more what I was hoping the first one would be. I wanted to read a book about what makes a millionaire. What were they like in school, how did they start out their career, what was their life like. I really wanted to hear first hand stories and examples. Instead, this book was simply pages upon pages of statistics restated to the reader who is seemingly incapable of reading a table of results themselves. This book could simply be a 50 pages packet of all the hard data results and be just as effective. Stanley used too much of his own commentary and not enough from the millionaires that he studied."
2,"statistical, boring and dry","I bought this book only because his first one ""the millionaire next door' was so good. Big disappoinment. He re-hashes the same material over and over again, then uses charts and graphs to reiterate what has already been said. I forced myself to finish it, and it did get a little better toward the end."
2,REAL MONEY MAKER.....FOR THE AUTHOR.....,"GREAT STORIES, BUT SO IS A FAIRYTALE. IF YOUR THINKING ABOUT BUYING THIS SAVE YOUR MONEY THE MILLIONAIRE SECRET IS ""LUCK AND TIMING""."
5,A REAL EYE OPENER,This book is a real eye opener. It really shows you how brain washed our society is. My daughter is in college and I'm going to have her read this book. Excellent!
1,"Sorry, there's more to life than money...","This shallow work assumes that the only measure of success in life is how many bucks you're worth. Forget being kind and compassionate and a good Mom or Dad--you folks are life's losers!Let's tell the truth: Lots of millionaires are just plain jerks (Does Donald Trump come to mind? ). Honesty and integrity got them where they are? Yeah, right. (Anyone ever hear how Ross Perot got rich? ) I'm sure these ""success determinants"" were self-reported. Who checked up on these people's real degree of honesty, dedication, etc.? I think these millionaires have swallowed their own P.R. and have bought into the Horatio Alger myth. I don't buy it, or this book."
2,A boring continuation to a fascinating start,"The ""Millionaire Next Door"" was a fascinating read that was almost impossible to put down. Research which acknowledged that the Sears charge card was one of the most popular credit cards in a millionaires wallet and many people with net worth over a million never made more than 70k a year was truly eye-opening information. However, ""The Millionaire Mind"" is full of boring platitudes. The book goes on and on about millionaire attributes of honesty and hard work. Furthermore it seems that the author only based his study on millionaires in the American South. The new economy millionaires of Silicon Valley and Seattle are curiously missing from Stanley's work. Furthermore, Stanley endlessly talked about how people achieved wealth,only in this book the average millionaire makes far more than the more modest yearly salaries of millionaires discussed in the ""The Millionaire Next Door."""
2,Disappointing,"I found ""The Millionaire Next Door"" to be truly enlightening and inspiring -- I've read it three times and recommended it to several people. ""The Millionaire Mind"" was not nearly as well written. Dr. Stanley has an overinflated opinion regarding how interested his readers are in him personally. I'd venture to guess that if he is, in fact, now a millionaire, it's not because he practiced the frugality of typical millionaires, but because he wrote a best-selling book and made a bundle all at once. His self-congratulating segues into discussing how he chose his wife, etc., rang false to me. This book was a boring sequel to the original, and not nearly as insightful. Skip it and reread the first one again."
3,"Only Useful If You've Read ""The Millionaire Next Door""","I enjoyed ""The Millionaire Mind,"" as it expanded on the principals and ideas of ""The Millionaire Next Door."" Unfortunately, this book offered very little in the way of new insight, and makes a poor substitute If you had to choose between reading only one of the two."
2,Try something else,"If you feel driven to become a millionaire, perhaps because someone once cast doubt on your potential, treat yourself to some therapeutic insights by reading ""Wealth Addiction"", by Philip Slater, rather than this kind of book."
4,Do you believe luck ?,"Sorry, I can not actually rate this book as I did not have chance to read it, but read the reveiws in this Web screen. But let me say that in Orient, there's belief on old saying that big money comes from heaven while dilignet people may earn their living. Money oriented people may get a big luck from heaven, whlie lazy ones fated to live hand to mouth - most possibly by will of God. Good talent, for sure, is helpful to make better money than poor talent, but it is not fundamental essence to be a millionare. My belief is that being loyal to catch the chance -given by God- as a awards for royal to one's ethic is the only key to be a millionare. Three big chances from heaven (God) throughout one's lifetime are supposed to be passing by everyone - Oriental people says."
1,Hope for the masses ?,"I got the perception that the work was very much playing on the hopes of the masses rather than providing true insight. It was almost saying ... 'its ok if your SATs scores are low because you too can be a millionaire...'. The constant reference to statistics also got a bit tedious. All in all, I was not impressed."
2,some useful info in an obnoxious package,"While there is interesting and possibly usable information in the book, Dr. Stanley comes across as a smug, tedious and obnoxious individual, I was very tired of spending time with him by the time I finished. There are a number of no-brainer insights presented as if they were the wisdom of the ages - decamillionaires are unlikely to play the lottery...hmmm. The spouse selection chapter reminds me of Gordon Liddy. It seemed there were twenty five mentions of the importance of clipping coupons before shopping for groceries - sorry, I just don't believe this is the key issue. And while Stanley has a point about interpersonal skills being as important as academic excellence, I am a little queasy about feeling sorry for the high school class president and football star afraid he won't measure up against the ""class brains"". I think you can get the maximum out of this book by skimming it in twenty minutes at a bookstore."
1,Disappointing,"I LOVED The Millionaire Next Door and I was looking forward to this book. What a waste of time and money. The author jumps to conclusions and then spends a lot of time belaboring the point. There is a fair amount of patting his own back. He zeroes in on small sub-groups of the millionaire club and praises them heavily (the low SAT-scorers and the religiously inclined.) This book was full of opinion and light on data. Without a careful listen, I would walk away believing I needed to join a cult and do poorly in school in order to build wealth.If you did poorly in school and are religious, you will LOVE this book because it'll make you feel like a rock star."
5,Audio book is the best,"I bought the book few months ago but I did not finish it, so I bought the audio book that I play when I am driving around in town audio books are good for people like me who are busy."
4,Interesting statistics.,"The author reminds us that these millionaires are frugal, persistent and well educated, although they don't always score high on their SAT tests. They are not workaholics, but finishers: they always complete their tasks or projects. They exercise frequently and are disciplined.Although not earthshaking, these data confirm what we have already suspected a long time ago, but never put them to work in our lives. This may explain why we are not millionaires.The question which was not addressed in this book is why we should strive to be a millionaire? What does a million represent to us: is it a badge of honor, a symbol of status, or a safety net? Many would argue that they would be happy if they are worth a quarter or half a million of dollars. No matter what, the above statistics point to a set of values and ethics we should follow, even if we don't aspire to be a millionaire."
2,Lousy Analysis,"I really liked ""The Millionaire Next Door"", but this book is a pale imitation.Here is the central logical flaw: the author offers a number of characteristics of the wealthy. In short, they are: people of integrity, hard working, tenascious, married, not necessarily straight A students, and good at getting along with people, frequently religious, and health conscious.And all of these characteristics may be frequently found among the wealth. I don't really doubt that.However, all of these characteristics can also be found among millions of people who are NOT wealthy.It is almost like saying: the wealthy typically own some socks. Ok. I am sure that is true. And yet it really doesn't help anyone understand the wealthy in a meaningful way since everyone, poor, wealthy or in between probably has some socks!"
5,Great Reading!,"Whereas ""The Millionaire Next Door"" looked at the affluent in the United States through a telescope, this book is even better because it uses a microscope. In ""The Millionaire Mind"" Dr. Stanley investigates the lifestyle of millionaires. Most (about 67%) are entrepreneuers who have been married for decades, live in an older house, and avidly take part in some type of worship. Contrary to popular belief, most millionaires do not play the lottery, own super-expensive luxury cars (or watches, or clothes), or gamble heavily. While this book alone will not make you wealthy, it is well worth reading."
2,This book will bore you if you read the first one,"A whole lot of nothing is in this book. I was very dissapointed because I thought there would be something new. But if you already read the first book, then I suggest to you to stay away from this one. There were a few interesting stories like the guy who sold salvaged truck parts and became a millionaire, but other than that, it is a total loss. It is basically a paper weight in my house now. Very dry reading as well. Like many other reviewers have said. Dryer than the first book, and that is hard to top.Also, someone is inflating (and deflating) the helpfullness votes for most of the reviews here. Take a look: If the review is a positive, then it would get over 50-100 helpful votes. And if it was a negative review, it would receive the opposite, 50-100 unhelpful votes. Can you guess which votes I'm going to get? If it's the author himself doing this, then you are a sad sad man."
2,A few useful nuggets of information,"Thomas J. Stanley hits on a few good points in this book. For instance taking more chances is associated with the millionaire mindset as are the patterns of intelligent spending as opposed to wasteful indulgence. But I felt that he was talking down to the reader and in order to get to the interesting and useful information you had to get past his ego, which wasn't always easy to do. Lastly it seemed to me that some of the examples he presented aren't exactly valid for the claims he makes. For instance he mentions how a former football player and successful businessman went bankrupt and he used the man's divorce as the reason after he quoted the article which stated the millionaire had failed to pay his taxes. Maybe he knows something more than he presented but it sounds to me that it was more likely his lack of paying taxes got him in trouble than the divorce settlement."
3,"Be ""Mindful""","I really liked 'The Millionaire Next Door,"" but I think that Thomas Stanley's follow up falls just a bit short.For a lot of the book, Stanley seems to be reiterating what he said in the first book. When he finally gets to the point, he seems to be stretching his data. I don't think that wife selection, religion, or clothing style have a whole lot to do with being a millionaire.This book is heavy on statistics and case studies, but it comes out light on content. I think that you can get away with reading ""The Millionaire Next Door"" and learn everything you need to know without reading this book."
1,"Should be titled, ""The Marketer-to-Millionaire's Mind""","The author surveyed a very biased sample of millionaires -- those living in the 1% of U.S. neighborhoods with high concentrations of affluent -- and then received back less than 20% of the surveys he sent out. He then makes a big deal that so many live in similar types of houses (you could guess this just by the survey distribution method) and are 45-year-old white males (ditto). He then liberally praises these people, and himself, for being so virtuous as to accumulate wealth. I really liked the first book (""Next door""), and was very disappointed with this one."
1,The Millionaire Rip Off,"This book made me so angry I don't know where to begin. I wish I had more than a 1000 words, because I could go on for 10 pages about the problems of this book. Even if you can get through the artless, tedious writing style, this book doesn't deliver anything new. I read The Millionaire Next Door, and I feel like I just read the same book again, only twice as long. What a waste of time.Don't be fooled: This book is nothing more than a transparent attempt to cash in on an earlier success. The author should be ashamed of himself."
3,The Sequel Is Never As Good,"The Millionaire Mind is simply a new ""chapter"" from the Millionaire Next Door. I found this book to be and extension of it's predecesor with a lot of the same information. This book is a good read and a good motivator but if you've read The Millionaire Next Door that's all the motivation you need."
2,Attemps to Prove Incorrect Thesis,"The thesis of this and the author's prior books is that ""millionaires"" live relatively frugal life styles. No research backs this hypothesis in this edition. And it strains credibility. Yes the average millionaire may love relatively frugally. Howver the average millionaire does not generate enough income from a million dollars to live otherwise. If you subtract those with net worth of a couple of million dollars, the very wealthy do indeed live life like the Gatsbys.Those palaces in Palm Beach, the Hamptons, Beverly Hills. The second homes in Vail, the rolls royces and ferraris are not owner by those with ""big hat, no cattle.""And the author seems less interested in truth than seeking out the relatively rare multimillionaire who lives in a $250,000 home.The book is a quick interesting read tho for its anecdotes only. Any academic or actual research value is missing."
2,Some good points hammered and hammered and hammered in,"As many critics before me, if you read one of Tom Stanley's book, make it The Millionaire Next Door. In that book, he discusses financial practices that will help you save money and in turn accumulate wealth. In The Millionaire Mind, he goes into the behaviors of wealthy people. The issue with this is that sometimes he discusses attributes that people cannot just snap their fingers and change. For example, he indicates that having a frugal, supportive spouse is very important. But, it's not as if people who have free-spending wives are just going to be able to trade them in! Another example is Stanley's ""discovery"" that it is critical for people to have people judgment skills and creativity. Great! Where can I buy such skills? I am not quite buying Stanley's premise that you can develop such skills easily.Entertaining book, but limited in value."
3,What if you don't care much about money?,"I am as stingy as the people profiled in Stanley's books - I just browsed through them in the store. What I don't get is the focus on accumulating wealth for its own sake. I mean why bother to be rich if you're not going to own an expensive car, take vacations, etc. Money is just a means; it shouldn't be seen as an important goal in its own right! Also, not to be disrespectful, these people don't seem very interesting, not really the type of people I would go out of my way to associate with. As you might guess, I am not conservative, family-oriented, nor much concerned with accumulating wealth. However, the book is interesting from a psychological standpoint."
2,Statistical truth is half truth,"I actually bought this by mistake. I was looking for Harv Ecker's book Secrets Of The Millionaire Mind, which I liked even less.Want to become a millionaire? Forget it if you're a single woman. Forget it if you're a man who chooses to marry a woman with dreams of her own. This book winds up being so supportive of the 'father knows best' stereotype of what leads to success that I found it annoying. This book looks for, and finds, great successful MEN who own businesses, go to church, have ""supportive loving"" wives and families. They turn out to be the largest group of the rich. What a surprise."
3,"More ""Millionaire Next Door""","""The Millionaire Mind"" carries on with the theme of the predecessor book, further investigating the lifestyle, habits, and goals of economically successful people. The new material is worthwhile reading for a potential entrepreneur, although somewhat marred by some bizarre digressions and a cacophony of self-help advice from the author."
5,It is a meaningful book,"I felt that Dr. Stanleys book was sensational. This text was very well researched and complete. It can take you off that ""poor mans"" treadmill and onto the road to wealth. I think that the Millionaire Mind is a great program to jump starts my financial life. Besides, it let me get a more understanding on what is the different between the millionaires and the lower-class people and start to learn to learn the millionaires¡ life style such as cannot enjoy life if I am addicted to consumption and the use of credit, choosing honest spouse. being courage and money is not my god."
3,Interesting and Tiring,"In ""The Millionaire Mind"" Thomas J. Stanley distills information that he has gleaned from millionaires about what they believe made them economically successful. ""The Millionaire Mind"" is filled with lots of interesting tidbits, amusing anecdotes, and practical advice.However, this book could have used some editing for consumption by the general public. For instance, it is interesting that most millionaires were not straight-A students who did well on standardized tests. However, it is very tiring to be told this same information in almost the exact same words at least a half dozen times during the course of the book.The practical advice was welcome and I enjoyed the book, but can only give it three stars due to its tendency to be repetitive."
2,Ditto,"Dr.Stanley used this sequel to line his millionaire pockets with our aspiring dollars. I thoroughly enjoyed The Millionaire Next Door, however, The Millionaire Mind was a disappointment. The book is filled with redundant information and incredibly boring personal stories."
2,Disappointing,"The negatives other reviewers (e. g., bombadillo & John Dunn) mention are disturbing, but I was most put off by what seem to me to be ""dumb"" errors, the kind usually caused by pure carelessness. This caused concern for what errors might exist that are not obvious. On p.7, he lists a few of the ""more than two thousand well established, older neighborhoods"" that his friend and associate Jon Robbin , ""a Harvard-trained mathematician and a brilliant researcher"" found for him. One in the list is ""Fort Worth, Texas 75225."" NOT! 75225 is University Park, a Dallas suburb. On p. 243, in bold print, no less, he says there are 1317 millionaires who say a supportive spouse is important for every 55 who both have a spouse and say spouses are unimportant to wealth accumulation. He then says ""That leaves only 55 in 1317 who..."" If these are valid examples of his research and his logical process, we should not give great weight to his conclusions."
1,There's nothing new in this book,"A really bad book. Here's why1. The first two chapters pretty much cover everything in the book. The rest of the book is full of examples.2. Not a very scientific study. For an author with a PhD, this is sad.3. There's nothing new this book has to offer, that isn't already in his previous book.4. Some of the examples come across as outrageous. And these are anecdotes - no way of verifying if they are true.5. The author comes to conclusions too soon, too fast. Lacks in-depth research.I bought this book for a penny, and thought it was a great deal. There's a reason why people are selling it for next to nothing."
2,What a bore ..... Save your money for author's original classic book,"This book is almost three times as thick as the original classic ""The Millionaire Next Door"", is full of statistics and numbers, not well cohesively written and in a disorganized layout. I would read the classic first (""The Millionaire Next Door"") and check this book out at the local library.My impression after reading and finally finishing this book was that Stanley wanted to create another bestseller, but this one was a mere compilation of facts and was not as well received by the critics as his classic. I imagine if you're a statistician or actuarian you're going to love this, but if you want a fast, easy, and conclusive read this is not for you.In retrospect, I could have spent my time better than reading this book. What a disspointment .... especially after reading ""The Millionaire Next Door."""
5,SO Easy. So Good.,Who would have known it was so easy? All the answers are here in this book. It takes a clever mind but inside are all the answers to your financial problems. Buy this book today! And free yourself at last.
2,Profiles for Upscale People and Marriage Tips Too.,"Mr. Stanley expands on his earlier theme but unfortunately takes on a self-congratulatory tone this time by going on at length about how he met and wooed his wife. His subjects continue to be mainly white college educated types from a middle class background with a few self made types thrown in for good measure. He ignores successfull minority folks while evinicing some more disdain for ""economic dropouts"". Some of the ancedotal info is interesting but any curious reader would be well advised to make a trip to the library and save their money. That's one way anyone can be frugal including economic dropouts."
2,Thank God Amazon pays for shipping this thing!,"I had high hopes for a classy omnibus of business wisdom with contributions from among the top people in the field, but this book is ponderous, difficult to use, and full of high-falutin' ""theories"" that we all have seen elsewhere, many times. Plus, it weighs a ton! In my opinion, I and my staff have gotten more out of a slim, quick-read like ""Raving Fans"" than we would reading something ""comprehensive"" like this. Many of these pieces would make good articles on their own, but I can't imagine anyone reading it straight through, or carrying it anywhere without a trip to your chiropractor's office. Caveat emptor."
3,Useful for rookie managers,"Goleman, a psychologist, did an impressive job, 100 biographic outlines on buiness leaders, facts and figures on 150 countries, 24 industries, 2200 pages..... and this book weighs over 10 pounds. For new managers, this book provides valuable information and the price is very reasonable. If you study at any business school or have been a corporate manager, there is nothing new in this book."
2,"Too big, yet not enough detail.","Despite being so big (which makes it unusable as a quick reference), this book attempts to cover so many areas of business that it just skims the surface of most of the areas that it covers (and it covers practically every area of business you can think of!!). One is left with one's interest aroused, and a suggestion for further reading if you want to know more.I think you're better off skipping this one and heading straight for the more detailed resources in the areas in which you are interested."
5,One heckuva reference book,"What a great book! Need information about maintaining websites? It's in there. Need info about starting a small business? It's in there. Somebody in your Sunday foursome recommend you look up something about the Fifth Discipline? There's a summary in there. Want to know the degree of cellphone penetration in Chile? In there. Child needs info about Howard Hughes for a book report? There's a biography in there.In short, a near complete encyclopedic reference on the theories, strategies, tactics, personalities, concepts, places, and literature throughout history. Well worth the bucks for any student of business."
5,It's on my recommended list,"When I ordered this book from Amazon[.com], I had no idea how valuable it would be to me. It sits in a prominent place on my desk. It's also currently on my ""Best 6"" list of business books for sales professionals on my book's website.Dave Stein"
2,Clever Name. Bad Book.,"Maybe it's just my fast paced brain, but I found that this book often read like a transcript of a conversation between completely uninteresting people. It's slow, it's confusing, and often consists of almost incoherent conversations between people who cuss at each other a lot.Fans of Graham Parker may find me harsh, and if you're a fan of Graham Parker you may want to give it a try. For me, the book just didn't live up to the clever title."
2,"Starts OK, Goes Astray","I started reading this as a beach book and I enjoyed the first, maybe, eight stories. The stories about his childhood and adolescence were charming and well-written. I had to put this book down, though, when Parker strayed into the dreaded ""live out my unfulfilled rock fantasy"" territory. Vignettes are interesting. Reading about some obscure rocker's fantasy to sing with the Stones via a self-gratifying, markedly unclever writing style is *not* interesting. If you must buy this book, tear out the last few chapters before you read it."
4,Good toaster,"I have owned it for about three weeks now.Pros- toasts evenly both thick and thin slices. The defrost feature works very well to slightly defrost the bread before toasting.Manual Popup feature works very well on small pieces of bread.The warmer tray works as advertised.Crumb trays are easy to remove and clean.Cons-wider than normal pieces of bread have to be forced down by hand.Crumb trays don't catch all the crumbs. Some accumulate under the toaster.The cons are minor nuisances for me as the features and performance far out weigh.Overall, I'd recommend if the cons are not a major issue for the user."
2,Lever broke but they are fixing it,"Update -- Customer service did fix the toaster and it worked like a champ for a year or so. Then the lever broke again. It still toasts, although unevenly, but we do miss the handy pop up action. Overall, we have had a bit of bad luck with this toaster.First Review -- We only had it for a week before one of the levers that pop up the toast no longer worked. Customer service was helpful and they are replacing the toaster. We liked the look and the speed and were moderately satisfied with the evenness of toasting. I will have to update the review after another try with the product."
2,Poor Toaster,"On the surface this looks like a great deal. A ton of features and good look. The bottom line, it does not toast even. If you can live with burnt tops and soggy bottoms, then I fell sorry for you. I feel sorry for the last sentence."
1,Stopped working in less than 3 months,I ordered this from HP direct. Stopped working after 3 months; very little use. Customer service from HP was terrible. They refused to take it back and wanted me to pay $29 and send it back to them so they could replace it with an old refurbished one. There is no authorized service center closer than 50 miles and I live in the middle of Los Angeles
2,Not very good,Clearly a low budget movie. It was kind of cute but not one I'd recommend to anyone I know. The acting could have been better too.
4,crafts,I bought this for my 9 year old Granddaughter as a Christmas gift so I don't yet know how she will like it. She is very much into arts and crafts and I thought this might be something she could do on her own while Mom is busy.It looks real cute and I think she will like it.
3,okay,I think this book is very creative but there is nothing to do with the animals when you finish them. and so i just put them in a drawer.
2,Don't Buy From Amazon,"This book is available from other sources New, for much less than Amazon is asking - even with the so called free s&h.; Why would anyone pay nearly $3o.oo for a book that sells elsewhere for under $5.00?This is an obsolete text book, but it does have a lot of basic information that every person starting a home network should know. It's just not worth anything like the price it sold for when it was originally published. The Author and the Publisher have already been paid their profit."
5,Music of the Civil War,"For ""Civil War Buffs"" and for musicians, this recording if one of the finest I have come across. Not only the ""popular"" styles of music for the time period, but also fife & drum music as well as music played during the battles.I was amazed at the sounds produced by the period instruments, and the wonderful musicians who performed on them.If you want great music - this is one of the best."
1,Did Not Work,"Just simply Did Not Work...leak in radiator, used this and leak still continued....ended up buying a new radiator ....not happy with product"
1,Portable Voodoo: Take Control of Your Life-and Others-with Voodoo,More of a laugh than a serious delivery of how to do practice the craft.Very dissappointing.
1,Nothing but a gag gift. Not serious Voodoo!,"Let me first of all say, that anytime you see the name Voodoo Lou. Be very cautious! The man is nothing but a trickster writing books and selling dolls about Voodoo like they were the real thing. If you're looking for a gag gift for someone who has a rotten boss,a stupid neighbor,or a emotionless lover, fine this stuff would give them a chuckle or two. But if you are looking for real Voodoo products stear clear of anything that has Voodoo Lou's name on it.(The person called 'bookfan' is the one that doesn't get it, this review was written to inform people about this product, and to let them know that this is indeed a gag gift and not a real book on Voodoo, so don't buy it unless that's what you're looking for.)"
1,Album Defies Physics,"My High School Physics teacher was wrong! It is possible for something to Suck and Blow at the same time because this album pulls it off.I am normally a mark for even a 1/2 decent comedian, I like comedians from Mitch Hedberg, Doug Stanhope, and Lewis Black to Dave Attell, Jim Norton, and The Blue Collar Guys. I've heard set after set of great comedy and this album may very well be the worst I've ever heard.Steve Hofstetter trys to come off as edgy and attempts to sound like David Cross. He has to resort to slamming an established comedian like Larry The Cable Guy instead of coming up with some material that is even remotely funny. I might donate this CD to the prison system as a new form of punishment, inmates will be begging for ""the chair"" after 10 minutes of this thing."
1,"Lame, unfunny, name-dropper","Forget the Cable Guy bashing, that's what we call low-hanging fruit at this point, not to mention it takes up less than a minute of the CD. It's the other names invoked in the liner notes and promotional materials for this decidedly unfunny CD that annoy me. Is he like David Cross? No, sir. George Carlin. Uh-uh. Bill Hicks? Not even close, Sonny. This is not ""The Thinking Man's Comic,"" as his website would have you believe. These are cheap shots at easy targets, and there's absolutely nothing new or funny here. One more thing: If you have a chance, listen very carefully to the ""laugh track"" on this CD, and I call it that because that's exactly what it sounds like. Notice how the audience laughs start and stop on dime, which makes the CD sound suspiciously like he recorded it in a studio and added the ""sweetening"" later. Whaddya say, Steve-o? Wanna fess up?"
4,A comedian who doesn't ask me to check my brain at the door,"If you like the intelligent comedy stylings of people like Hicks, Izzard and Cross, check out this album. Hofstetter is smart and funny in riffs on everything from pop culture to international relations and everything in between. Hofstetter also skewers Larry the Cable Guy's idiotic ""humor,"" pointing out that the netted-hat redneck hero not only promotes narrow-mindedness but (maybe more importantly) is not funny.On behalf of myself and other Americans with a functioning brain left in their heads, I wholly endorse this album."
1,Hack Attack,"How much money did this guy's mom pay to have this thing made? Steve is a decent comic - he'd be an OK middle act on a cruise ship and maybe even a closing act in the Pocono's - but not a headliner worth filming. Not yet.After watching his DVD for twenty minutes I shut it off in disgust. This is a badly directed shooting of an open mic quality act. His ""edgy wit"" amounts to ""racism is bad."" Wow. Talk about taking chances! How about some more ""thinking man's"" humor?""The French can hold their liquor, just not their territory."" Pah-dump-bump. Get it? It's a WWII reference. I think Rush Limbaugh told that one. Two years ago. And it wasn't funny then.He steps on his own jokes, doesn't connect with his audience and has nothing to say. For all his spouting about artistic integrity you'd expect more than pandering.Please don't compare him to Bill Hicks, Lenny Bruce, George Carlin, Richard Pryor, Dennis Leary or Lewis Black - unless you say, in comparison - he's not worthy of comparison."
2,"""comedy"" ?","listen... i get the edgy stuff. i'm a huge fan of it: lewis black, david cross, marc maron, bill hicks, george carlin, richard pryor, patton oswalt... i get it. seriously. unfortunately, steve hofstetter will not be added to my every growing list of amazing stand up comics.his delivery is horrible and all his bits are rehashed and hackneyed. he fumbles through bits on racism and terry shiavo. he fumbles through bits on relationships. he fumbles through 45 minutes i'll never get back. the audience laughter seems equally forced and nothimg more than polite.i made the mistake of buying this cd/dvd atrosicty solely based off the bill hicks name drop and the cd cover (words can't describe my hatred for larry the cable guy). save your money... at any cost.i didn't even waste my time with the dvd."
1,I like Lou Reed but this Rock Opera Sucks.,"Very bad lyrics, bad music and no flow at all make this a terrible album. The other listeners have to be blind (and deaf) followers of Lou Reed or get stoned when they listen to this album. Fingers on a chalkboard. That's what I hate about album reviews is that even if an album sucks fans will try to stick up for there idol and never rate them in a true manner."
5,One of the few that knew this was a masterpiece the first time.,"When I first heard this album in 1978/79 for the first time I knew it was a work of art. I was 18/19 and part of the ""Rock n Roll Animal"" crowd. Being a musician myself and also involved in the drug scene and having just had a hard breakup with a girlfriend, I was able to relate to the concept of this album. I don't think any other album as a whole has had that affect on me since. There are songs that I relate to but to have a whole record speak to me at where I was at at that time was amazing. Most of my friends thought it was rubbish but I knew it wasn't. I found a copy of it in a thrift store and bought it immediatly. It was in excellant condition, no suprise, and am hoping to find it on CD soon since all that is available here is the mp3 of it."
5,Timeless,"Has a better, more poignant rock album ever been recorded? Has any work defied and withstood the test of time more gracefully than than this?I first listened to Berlin thirty years ago and it just didn't connect, either musically or intellectually. But a relistening of the record today demonstrates that it as relevant as ever and it was certainly decades ahead of its time. The transitions, bass line, and recordings of crying children combine to make The Kids a classic within a classic. Berlin is, quite simply, a masterpiece."
1,Cheaper Elsewhere,"Lowes Home Center sells these for under $10.00. I know, I just bought a couple of them on 11/07/09.Sam"
2,15 months then it broke...,"I had this tea kettle and although it was hot on the outside after boiling water (like my old stove-top one), I was pretty happy with it. Then after 15 months it stopped working. There's something wrong with the on-off switch or the way the lid connects and it will no longer boil. I talked to Krups to find out if it were fixable and it doesn't seem to be. The lack of longevity is very frustrating. I wish things were made better."
1,Arrived not functioning,"I had a Russel Hobbs electric kettle, made in the UK, which worked well for 3 years. When it finally died, I ordered one of these, based on the glowing reviews. It arrived new from Amazon not working.LF Port Jefferson, NY"
2,Krups,"Krups is a good Kettle, but it does not last for more than 2 years, and in one of them, I detected rust in the bottom of it, around the seal. So if you want a kettle for only 2 years, this is your choice."
5,Krups Electric Kettle,"This is a 1750 watt kettle where almost all others are 1500 watt. It heats water for my French press FAST. I've had other kettles over the years, but this Krups beats them all. Handle and lid stay cool. Swivel base is a nice touch."
2,Doesn't Last,"The tea pot was great. That is while it lasted. I bought the Krups stainless steel pot because I wanted a good quality product that would last for years. It lasted one year, that is all. The switch in the pot is bad. A friend bought one at the same time, her kettle is the black style, after a year it is starting to leak.A disposable item. For a year they are great but then they die."
2,Fair Product,"Was disappointed in the quality of this Krups Electric Kettle. The base is made from cheap plastic and the top portion of the kettle contains much plastic as well. I purchased a Breville electric kettle a few months prior to this purchase and will be sending this Krups back and getting another Breville. Some company needs to come up with a totally stainless steel model (lid and all). Breville model is more elegant, better design, and has less plastic exposed to boiling water and steam."
4,stove space saver,"saves space on the stove, sharper looking than a regular kettle, faster results...and it was free via a gift card!"
5,Velcro Straps,They work great. Many uses can be found for these. They hold a bit tight for something you might want to do and undo frequently.
2,Not the best....,"I have been playing these types of games for about two years now. It started with Everquest. Everquest was slow moving, boring but soooooooo addictive....Now I'm playing Lineage. It takes everything Everquest did makes it 100x better and also throws in some great new ideas. Lineage has this thing called bloodpledges which are groups of warriors led by a prince or princess.These bloodpledges are always trying to capture castles that other bloodpledges control and its a great thing to do after you get to a high level unlike in Everquest when you stand around waiting for teh next expansion pack when you get to a high enough level.Speaking of expansion packs Lineage releases a new episode every month(its now on epiode 9) and a new continent 4 times a year. It's like getting 4 free expansion packs a year!!! And trust me these continents are HUGE!(...)And if you join make sure you play the Ken Rahuel Server and talk to me. My in game name is hobbester"
2,Sluggish compare to DAOC,"This was a highly anticipated expansion for the most successful MMPOG ever made. However, the magic is not there any more. The expansion is SLOW, I meant slow for a P1.7 with 512 RAM, GeForce 3 video card, and ADSL connection with average ping under 40, Windows 98 SR2. It runs fine on my XP machine with P3 933 and 256 RAM, GeForce 2, however. Once I restore everything back to pre-Luclin (copy back the original EQ directory), everything is fast again. DO NOT install this thing without backing up your current EQ directory."
3,"Good game, graphics are .. ok","Hey, this game is fun.. but the graphics are only 'ok'. The main problem i have with the graphics is that you cant see any atmosphere or sky effects. There is an option for '3d sky' but it only works in one zone that i've seen so far and it is just random cloud patterns. Also, you cant see very far into the distance. If you've played Operation Flashpoint and you like the sky/horrizon effects, you will be dissapointed. Also, the various avatars are not very accurate. sometimes they game looses track of NPCs and players and they appear out of no where and disappear.. Apparently it is lag related but i've played many multiplayer games like Unreal tournament and i've never seen anything this bad.. except duke 3D back in 1995."
1,Absolutely Pathetic,"You figured the guys at Verant would have at least tested this buggy piece of garbage. But, as it is, their motto is ""your in our world now."" and I suppose the rest of that statement ought to read; ""and if you don't like it, then tuff..."" Horrible customer service and a condescending, and almost disdainful regard for their ""customers"", is par for the course for these clowns. I would strongly recommend this tittle for those with strong masochistic tendencies."
1,My luck may not be in with Luclin,"I have not bought this game expansion, and will not do so, until the bugs introduced have addressed.Somehow, the introduction of the new expansion for Everquest has created many bugs with graphics and sound in the original game, without even installion of the expansion.These render the game unplayable for me, but as this is a subscription based service, I still have to pay for time I cannot use. My PC is up to spec even for the new expansion, with Win2k, Geforce, SB Live, 512 MB RAM - anyone with a spec lower than this be warned!Also Windows 95 is no longer supported, yet boxes of the original game and expansion are still on sale with W95 stated as supported.Be sure to check the forums on the official Everquest web site for current technical issues before purchasing this or any Everquest based product.This review was written on 8/12/01."
1,Rushed product.,This was an extremely poor expansion. Verant Interactive rushed to get this product out of the door and in the processes caused a lot of stability issues with the Luclin client. Even 2 months after release they are still trying to fix bugs within the SoL code to allow players to play at a decent speed.Save your money. If you have to have this expansion wait another 6 months where in typical MMORPG fashion the majority of bugs will be fixed.
2,Where does therealeric get the info from,I would just like to know where these bars are that eric goes to!
1,Don't buy this game!!,"Hello, I would have to say that on the order of 1-5 id give this game a neg 10. Why? Because it is unplayable. I own a mid range system, well over 1/2 GIG of ram, voodoo5 with 64megs. I found that swiming through molassas would be faster than trying to play in the new zones. Ive never seen such terriable frame rate/lag in 20 years of gameing on a puter. And for the record, Ive been a loyal EQ fan for 3+ years, paying in beta, and throught ever expansion release. Ive never seen such horrible performace. Sony/Verant has really done a backslide on their ability to present a playable module. Some might say it runs great on a P<whatever> with a 1 gig+ processor, well to you i say, if you need a 1 gig proc, to run an app that is not server or DB related, somethings wrong... If you feel you have some twisted desire to own this module, send me an email, ill sell you mine.....Rachanretired 53 cleric(and others)CT server..."
1,ok.. Sony didn't learn the lesson,"1)Graphic is old (please, wake up and compare this game with others MMORPG on the market now)2)Lag is awful3)Customer service? .. hemmm what is it?4)Bugs: at will !5)Camp, camp, camp .. and camp again. Play EQ if you like to camp mobs for hours and hours and hours,wasting your time doing the same thing at will.6)SoL is huge, yes, but if you think this is a positive thing then prepare yourself to spend HOURS running up and down with an high % to be killed by lag & ubermonsters.7)This game is a dinosaur in the MMORPG world!P.S.: played EQ for 3,5 years: I know very well what is this game.Now I'm a DAoC player and I'm happy !Good Luck EQ players!!! The whole ""very-first-set-of-EQ-players"" (we tested it) is waiting for you in DAoC."
1,I wish I hadn't.....,"This was a big waste of money. As far as I'm concerned, the only thing Luclin is good for, is teleporting."
1,SUPER LAGG A LOPOGIS,Crashes every ten seconds and everyone is running around naked! Whats up with that?
1,Out of date RPG,"I bought this after I got Dark Ages of Camalot. Forget it. the game has really poor graphics compared to DAoC. The game has to much infighting between the people on line and new people in the game cannot compete with the ""Twinks"" who come along and camp all the stuff needed to advance. This game is really obsolete and there are much better games out there on the market now. Spend you money elsewhere."
2,Not durable or accurate,"As a professional homebuilder, I've used most of the saws on the market. I've also experimented with blades and saw stands. This saw is simply not well designed. If you can't reproduce the same angle of cut consistently, then the saw has no right on a job site. Specifically, the locking system for the miter stop is difficult to control precisely. You must check the gage on both sides to ensure it's even in the range-forget fine control. More importantly, the sliding system that supports the saw head flexes and allows the blade to deflect. Even with thicker, stiffer blades, I get multiple cut lines on the material. Lastly, the safety guard is dangerously sloppy. It gets stuck on the work material or interrupts saw use in general. With the prices of other well-designed saws dropping (e.g. Hitachi, Makita) why even consider this saw. If you inherit one you can use it as a chop saw or for decking! Delta makes many fine tools, but this is not one of them."
2,not an accurate saw.,"i bought one of these saws and used it on a few projects, and noticed the cuts weren't square.with the way it drops into each setting , it is hard to get a accurate setting. if you use this for rough framing , it would be a great saw.it is also fairly heavy , so if it has to be moved alot , you might want to consider another saw.i just bought a hitachi c8fb2 , and am very happy with this saw!it can be more easily adjusted than the delta."
1,"one star, because 0 was not available","Inaccurate table stops, stand keeps falling apart,motor did not last long, I found this site searching for parts, which are near impossible to find and 3 times more expensive than other brands, I have saws from two other brands with little or no problems, this one is a major dud."
5,Adam's Return by Richard Rohr,Richard Rohr's book is great as a reference to anyone who is in a position to give counseling to young adult males. It deals with the 5 major principles of the initiation of young adults into a culture of spiritualization.
2,The slingshot,"poor picture quality,several picture dropouts,looks like a bad copy of a VHS original,I was very disappointed when viewing this title."
2,"short working range, picky on mouse-pad or surface color, be aware!","I definitely agree with the assessements of other two buyers. This mouse won't fit your palm (the name ""mini""), but the most annoying is that it works only on dark, block surface colors like dark blue, and it won't work on green, red, mixed, or white colors. The other thing you need to know is that its maximum working range is < 23' from the USB plug. Don't recommend it."
2,very short range,"The wireless range seemed to be exceedingly short. With the receiver plugged into the back of the Mac keyboard, the mouse would work only within a distance of about 6-8"" in front of the keyboard. After one more inch, the reception became very erratic, and after another inch it dropped off completely."
1,Sorry mouse do NOT buy,"have bought 4 of these pieces of garbage.. Worked fine for about a month and then jittery, and then off and on. would work and would not...batteries do NOT continue to make good contact with the battery contacts, spring for the right battery compresses, and moves so that the battery no longer makes contact after a while. All 4 I have bought went this route and I will NEVER buy kensington again...TOO MUCH MONEY FOR A PIECE OF JUNK THAT DOES NOT WORK PAST a couple weeks or one month...STAY AWAY FROM This one...t"
1,Terrible. Do not buy.,"I've owned this mouse for a few months and I outright hate it. The thing goes into sleep mode after 20 mins, which you would think would be a good thing to save the battery, but it takes FOREVER for the thing to wake when you want to use it. Congrats Kensington, you robbed me of my 30 bucks but it will be the last money you get from me. Oh yeah and when it did wake, it was jittery and difficult to use on any surface. Total JUNK!"
4,This book is just awesome!,"This book along with its companion Let's learn Hiragana(which must be previously studied before moving into this one) is surely a great step to mastering Japanese writing and reading. Within a month I could read and write perfectly. At first I thought I would not make it, but Yasuko paved me the way. Now I'm buying Let's learn Kanji and Let's learn more Kanji both from the same series. The book is not a 5-star because it is sold as being a book for self students but it doesn't have all the answers on the answer key. For [$$$] you get both Japanese writings quick and painlessly."
5,Very easy to understand and follow,"With it's partner, the first book of JP Writing, this book is great.You've got to find different sources for learning how to speak however but these are excellent at getting through literacy."
5,Very Good,"The set up on this and the introduction seem like it will make learning pretty easy. I had to wait a long time to receive it from Amazon, I don't know if that will change in the future. The book itself is set up to learn the characters in groups of 15, and has plenty of exercises to reinforce what you learn. I like the looks of it."
5,Let's Learn Katakana by Yasuko Kosaka Mitamura,Would recommend to anyone who is interested in learning Katakana. My order came promptly and in perfect condition.
2,Very Disappointed,"I was greatly disappointed in this bookIt does NOT have:Answer keynor examples1st set of 15 is just 2 pages to practice writing, then you turn the page and it gets right into the "", but with only 1 example of the ones covered and then it starts right in on writing and reading without even an answer keyThis book is not for the true beginner and certainly not for self-study.Yes it has a lot of practice; but I am a complete beginner trying to learn on my own without a class. Therefore, I need at least 1 example of how each one is written and an answer key to know that I am on the right track - which is missing from this book.If anyone knows of a truly helpful book that offers PRACTICE in both Reading and Writing - WITH an ANSWER KEY - I would truly appreciate it.I can't understand how so many books, including this one, get away with not having an answer key and yet call themselves beginning books."
1,Returned twice!,"I bought this camera and it would not load the first two rolls of film (drop and load?). We finally got the third roll to load. That was the ONLY roll of film we got out of this camera. I returned it and was given another one, brand new in the box. The film STILL would not load and even the clerk at the photo store could not understand the problem. I didn't opt for a third S1450. Instead, swapped it out for a different company's camera."
4,Rough,"i had to get this book for class, And for me in particular it was a hard read. i highly recommend getting ""Key words in Islam"" by Ron Greaves to compliment the book."
5,really awesome cd!!!,Eisley rocks my socks!!! They are the best band ever. Their songs and lyrics are amazing and beautiful. -pinklady3365
5,"Marvelous Things: Its Exactly That, a Marvelous Thing.","This E.P. is 15 straight minutes of pure amazement. Eisley's wonderful melodies and fantastic harmony's are what keep me listening to this CD over and over again. The record starts out with 'Marvelous Things', a brilliantly written dream song that takes you to another land. 'Memories', is a terrific love song, I adore it's lovely harmonies. 'Sea King' is one of my favorites. It tells a story of an underwater Ruler. The last song is perfect to listen to for this season, 'The Winter Song'. Makes you feel like winter right when you hear it!"
5,Simply Marvelous,"This EP really shows what Eisley is all about. This EP ranges from haunting melodies, such as, Marvelous Things to the mellow sounds of Memories. This and Laughing City is the EP to get because it's truly amazing."
3,Love Entourage- Why only 10 Episodes?,"I love Entourage and have watched all the seasons. I enjoyed season 7, though I couldn't believe it was only 10 episodes. Why HBO thinks 10 30 minute episodes is a season is beyond me. And season Eight is only 8 episodes. Its like they both should be one season, and HBO is splitting them into to two like they did Season 3 (Parts one and two in separate dvd sets).I'm sorry to see Entourage end, though I'll be glad to not give HBO any more of my money!"
2,I hate to admit it...,"""Entourage"" is one of my favorite shows, and I own every season. This season however has been the weakest yet, as the storylines disrespect the characters we love, and they are almost all depressing. Vince is going the way of Lindsay Lohan. Turtle is a struggling business owner. Drama and Eric are going through the exact same things they did last season. There is a major lack of fun - the balance is just off. I will remain loyal to the show, but this edition of the series is not it's shining moment."
1,It didn't work,"I tried to play the DVD on my laptop, my friends blue ray player and two other blue rays DVD players to no success.I was sold a bad copy and ripped off !! I want my money back"
4,By Far almost the Weakiest season,"I have to be honest when I first saw this season I was a little disappointed because it felt like it wasn't going anywhere. However, the Final Episode stepped up and made it more interesting. This season has way more drama than comedy, which is why to me, the season took a little downfall. I really hope that Season 8 brings the same excitement seasons 1 through 6 had because it would be a little disppointing if they didn't end the Series with a Big Bang. Regardless, of what I say I would still buy Season 7 on DVD since I am a Big Fan of Entourage."
5,Enjoyed It,The product meet my expectations and I got a price that was half-off in comparison to the department stores that carry this
4,Entourage,"Love the show and appreciate being able to see it via DVD and not having to subscribe to the TV station.So far, early on in the first disk still, it seems to be not as good as in seasons past. But I will give it a chance and still look forward to the remaining 7 episodes I need to view."
3,Too Much Drama!!!,"I've been watching Entourage since the beginning, and this season gave me a headache watching each week. It was like watching a really bad soap opera. If it wasn't Ari's wife, moaning, Turtle was begging for money, and Drama crying for work it could have been good. This season Vince falls hard for a porn star, and becomes addicted to cocaine. The focus is less on Vince this season and more on everyone else, which is not good imo."
1,Whoa..,"Well, I went into this season very excited and curious to what was going to happen.. And then all the sudden it was the season final... What?! There is only 10 not even 30 minute episodes, and honestly I don't even remember what happened in some of the episodes. Let alone this season.. Sorry guys, I love this show but this season was a bit weak. I am excited and hoping for something better next season!"
2,The Ari Gold show,"Loved this show for the first few seasons, but I think they ran out of situations for Vince to get laid a couple of seasons back. This season was very disappointing, I agree with a lot of the other posters that the writers seemed to backtrack on the motivations that seemed to make these characters tick for six seasons to try to squeeze a little more life out of this show. Jeremy Piven as Ari Gold is the saving grace of this season, and to me, has always been this shows's strongest part. I think HBO should think about a reboot focusing just on Ari and his life and other clients. I think there's a lot more material there if you want to keep the premise going."
5,This CD captures prime live Airplane performances.,"These performances, recorded shortly after the release of ""After Bathing at Baxters"", capture the Jefferson Airplane at their live prime. This CD is a great addition to their classic disk ""Bless Its Pointed Little Head"". The band was improvising heavily during this time, which makes the familiar Airplane tunes included on this CD fresh and interesting. At over 76 minutes, it's a great value too!"
1,very disappointing,"Most of this is so sloppy that it's barely listenable. When the songs come out well (""Greasy Heart"", ""Pooneil""), they're very similar to the album versions, which are better. The only thing particularly worth hearing about this CD is the version of ""She Has Funny Cars"", which is about 1.5 times faster than the original."
3,For Hardcore Airplane Fans Only,"I saw Jefferson Airplane a bunch of times during the band's heyday, including twice at the Fillmore East, and can attest to the authenticity of this compilation. The music was raw-edged and LOUD. With the light-show doing to your retinas what the music was doing to your eardrums, it was easy to forgive (or not to notice altogether) off-notes and excesses. But take away the visual distractions and play it at less ear-splitting volume and the flaws become all too conspicuous. I like this disc because it transports me to a now-distant time and place that I recall with great fondness. Unless you're a hardcore Airplane fan, however, I'd steer clear of it in favor of Bless Its Pointed Little Head, a truly great live album of the same vintage."
2,A disappointment,"This album is disappointing for a band of this caliber. The production values are sub-par and vary per track as to whether or not you can actually hear Jorma's lead guitar. The band also sounds a little loose and unfocused on some of the tracks as well. Go to ""Bless It's Little Pointed Head"" or the live stuff on the box set ""Jefferson Airplane Loves You"" if you want to hear what this band could really do live. Frankly, I am surprised the band (assuming they had any control over it) allowed this to be released. For die hard fans only."
5,Great book!,"Lyon's Pride is great, I've read P.E.R.N. and Acorna, but my favorite of McCaffrey's seris' is the Rowan seris. It is interesting to see a family, born from a orphan, grow to be the largest influence around. THe children face hardships that can occur, and they deal with them. It's a realistic book/seris other than the telempathic-kenetic abilities. I loved Rowan and I have enjoyed the seris through Lyon's Pride. Its is wonderful. I suject anyone read it."
4,A good read worth the time.,"What makes this book worth reading is the that we are able to follow the lives of Damia's children as well as the rest of the extended family. For me that is always what made this series worth reading was the family's dedication to each other in-spite of their egos and talents. This 4th book in a series of 5 Lyon's Pride by Anne McCaffrey is set in the universe we have come to expect of her Talents series. The story continues on with Humanity and it's Allies continued fight against the hivers. There are several subplots that are set up or carried along for conclusion in the 5th book. But it is worth the read if you like this series, and McCaffrey in general."
3,"Not much of a plot, unlike other McCaffrey books","This book wasn't as good as the other books in this series (The Rowan, Damia, Damia's Children) because nothing happened. I mean, what really did they achive in this book? It was really confusing. This also follows in the pattern of Anne McCaffrey's notorious endings---it doen't end. There was a potentially good part somewhere in the latter part of the book, but Ms. McCaffrey kept going on. I think she should learnto write good resolutions. That way, her book would beed even better than before."
1,Boring,"This books along with the latter talent books are so unrealistic as to be boring. The first talent books, Pegasus in Flight and Pegasus in Space were interesting and fun because we were reading about real characters.They had Talent, but they were still real people.The characters in the latter talent books are nothing less than gods, with an almost all-powerful Talent, and seemingly little or no personal problems or limitations (which makes th books dull). Also, what the books really portray, without actually saying it is basically a Talent autocracy. Non talented are inferior and unimportant, and the talented rule over everyone else with their powers. This reminds me of Star Trek, where everyone is law abiding, and the authority of the Federation is unquestioned.So what happens to those who question the authority of the Federation? They are automatically outlaws. Its really quite totalitarian.Anyway, this book is boring and not worth the money."
2,Tastes Like Kerosene,I purchased a 12 package box of this jerky. I had eaten some before and it was fine. This box was different. I don't know if is was the way it was made or what but it tasted like kerosene or maybe charcoal lighter fluid I can't put my finger on it. My six year old grandson is a jerky conniesuer and noticed it right away.
4,For a selective audience,"Not everyone will go for Eve 6. They have a definite punk influence in their music, but how many Dead Kennedys fans do you see listening to Eve 6? Not many. Some of their sound is more mellow, but how often do you come across a Celine Dion fan wearing an Eve 6 T-shirt? Not often. Overall, I was impressed by the intelligent lyrics and the well-written tunes. Still, this album was not my style. Something was lacking in it, so I traded it in to a used record store."
1,"Ok, but...","I listened to this CD at the local Blockbuster, and was pretty muchly disappointed. Other than ""Inside Out"", which is cool, all the songs sound the same!! Definately listen to the WHOLE album before you buy it. This CD isn't worth it in my opinion."
1,Grunge-by-numbers,"Kids, please don't encourage record companies to keep signing fourth-rate derivative swill like Eve 6 by wasting your paper route money on this CD. I know that your local ""Modern Rock"" radio station and MTV are cramming ""Inside Out"" down your throat, but please show them that you are capable of making adult choices and seeking out good music on your own. That irresistable burning urge you are feeling to purchase this CD is nothing more than a few dorky accountants and marketing guys at Eve 6's record label having their way with you like a cheap date. Avoid that urge. There is plenty of good music out there for you to spend your allowance money on. Go do a little homework and you'll find it."
2,WEIRDOS........,"I have to admit, Eve 6's one song that's on MTV that goes,"".....wanna put my tender, heart in a blender watch it spin around to a beautiful oblivion. Rendezvous and I'm through with you..."" is pretty poetic, but the band and the rest of tis songs suck. I'm sorry. I gotta give'em credit for trying and getting an album out and stuff. Sorry."
1,pretty bad...,An extremely unimaginative album. They're stuck in early 90's mode and they can't get out. Don't bother.
4,Nice,"These guys are good lyricists, that's for sure. The hits Leech and Inside Out are classic pop lyrics for the ages. But disguising the songs with a punk beat was pure genius. A lot of other songs on the album are worth mentioning, Open Road Song, Jesus Nitelite, Small Town Trap are all great songs on their own. Eve 6 says what they want to say quickly and then move on. The album is really short, you won't get bored with it, and you'll play it again and again. It's that catchy and good."
3,Over and over and over...,"First of: Leech was the wrong song to release. Inside Out was perfect, Open Road song great, but Leech almost killed an otherwise good cd. Don't get me wrong: I do like this cd, but the songs to get tiring after a while. For me, it was about 4 or 5 months before I stopped listening to it all together...it was just worn thin. If you listen closely, alot of the songs sound the same and the ones that don't SUCK (ie Jesus Nitelight). It's a good cd, but for $#it$ sake don't put it on repeat! It'll make you sick!"
5,Eve 6 = Much more than just Inside Out,"Usually if there's 2 songs on a CD that I like, I'll buy it even if the rest suck. So hearing Inside Out and Leech made me decide to get it. I would have been fine with just 2 good songs and the other 9 be fingernail against chalkboardish crap. But I was amazed at the quality of this CD. Every song is catchy, has great lyrics, and spectacular instruments. Take a look at the reviews that give this a 1 star - usually they are one liner no-thought junk like ""thhhis CD suxz i dont think u shuld by it""."
4,Some great songs. Not all around wonderful though.,"I first got this CD just to listen to ""Inside Out"". Then I discovered ""Open Road Song"" <--anyone know if that song is played during the opening credits of the movie, Can't Hardly Wait ? I think it is. There are a few other ok ones, but nothing too spectacular. I recommend this CD, but don't hope for too much."
4,A kicking new album from a kicking new band.,"This album is really a great start for this band. It has a little of everything from some hard metal and punk to alternative and a little carribean mixed in on the song ""Small Town Trap"". This band has a lot of potential and we will be hearing more about them later on. One of the things that makes them good are the ""hook"" in their songs. The part that you really remember from the song. They also add great harmony in both vocals and instrumentation. The place I think they fall short is their lyrics. They don't have a whole of meaning like other bands such as Everclear and Aerosmith, who do have great lyrics do go along with great songs. Aside from that though, I think Eve 6 is off to a great start."
5,EVE 6 ROCKS!!!,I think Eve6 is a band here to stay unlike most of the new bands coming out lately. MAX COLLINS' voice and lyrics are AMAZING! I LOVE him...he is my favorite singer since Kurt Cobain! Keep up the amazing work!
5,Great CD,"Eve 6 is a great band with great style. This CD proves that you can make good music without having an EXPLICIT LYRICS label on the cover. Buy the CD, it never gets old."
5,it is one of the greatest,one of the best cd's i've heard in a long time. thought it had great lyrics without having explict lyrics.
3,Good start . . . good album . . . doesn't really excel,"I purchased the album for the song Inside Out, because the CD-single cost more. I am not disappointed.If you are looking for punk, this ain't it. Does the band pretend to be punk? It's a little thrashy, in a popular kind-of-way. This album feels like a first album, as though it's missing some maturity. And, some of the songs sound too much alike. However, aside from Jesus Nightlight, none of the songs are really bad.I'm not disappointed. There's something to the lyrics that has convinced me to keep an eye out for the band's next release . . .. If you are going to pickup Inside Out, I'd recommend you pass on the single and get the album. You might be non-plussed but you won't be disappointed."
5,Gotta-Grab-Gift!,"If you have looked at the other reviews you can see what the general (well save 1 or 2) populace thinks of this CD. For me it ranks up there with my Alanis Morisette Cd's and Garbage's Version 2.0. I bought it just to buy it, but it was great. I didn't expect it to be this good but if you want a stocking stuffer... GET THIS!"
4,Ummm its pretty good,"This C.D. is pretty cool. Definately good enough to buy. There are some very good songs but some bite. They Kinda remind me of matchbox twenty, i dont know why but they do. I think you should buy this so stop reading and go spend money!"
4,this stones... opps in mean rocks its good but not that good,there are a few good songs but not two many its good and its worth buying. Its not as bad as semisonic or Fatboy slim though
2,Eve,"Eve 6 are the most blatant Green Day ripoff I've lately had the displeasure of hearing. This album lacks diversity (it has even less than the aforementioned band's earlier works), it is overrated and annoying. There may be nothing I can do to keep clueless teenyboppers from slapping 5 stars on this garbage, but at the very least I can warn rock's more intelligent fans away.What verbal skills? ""the lack thereof would leave me empty inside?"" ""I feel ambitious today, and so does my foot, as I press it to the floor?"" Forgive me for laughing. This record is an embarassment to modern music. There are few things more annoying than derivative, undeserving teenage rock stars. The catchy melodies are there behind the horrendous lyrics...problem is, we've heard them all before. Eve 6 oughta hit the books--they've got the instrumental skills to make some real music...if they can find their own sound and produce poetry that's more than laughable."
1,Speaking of one-hit wonders...,"Perhaps the worst victims of the post-grunge treatment, Eve 6 are as below-average as music gets. ""Inside Out"" is their only marketable hit, the rest is a shamble of third-rate American college radio junk. The singer's voice (I couldn't be botherd to get his name) is horrible, while their music is lacking in one main ingredient: talent. Like Deep Blue Something before them, they'll essentially remain one-hit wonders, and terrible ones at that."
4,Great,"Eve 6 first struck me(at the begining of the album) as a good sligthly energetic rock goup with nothing truley great about them, just good. But as the cd goes on and you listen to songs like Showerhead and Jesus Nitelite you relize they can be chilled too, with sort of an incubus type style. They can have the energy Green Day delivers and on the same cd have the same chilled moving style as incubus. I think this is a great cd."
3,Whatever...,"I purchased this CD in the hopes of it being a good album. After hearing ""Inside Out,"" I was truly impressed and thought that Eve 6 would have similar songs on the CD. Nope. Instead, a bunch of noise fills in the rest of the CD. Inside out is Eve 6's first hit...and will probably be their last."
5,boom,eve 6 in the house. seller was great but eve 6 wasn't as satisfying as i thought. get the album for the one hit song and then feed the rest of the cd to a 24' long bass
3,EVE 6 OVERRATED!!!!!,"When I first heard this CD i thought, this isn't bad but it isn't that great either. Inside Out is a good song, until the radio station ""Turns it inside out"". Personal favorite: LEECH."
3,their next album should be interesting...,"considering this is eve 6's debut album, and that the band is composed of 18-year-olds, it's a pretty impressive cd . they manage to release some fresh-sounding singles in a much-exhausted genre of music and their craftsmanship is solid. however, the album itself is repetitive, the lyrics pretentious, and their drums can be outright annoying in some songs. i do think the band has some potential (inside out is undeniably catchy, and i love the guitar on superhero girl), and many of these problems could be solved with maturity. i'd be interested in hearing their second album when it comes out."
2,"Sing to the tune of the chorus of ""Leech""",Sucking on my brain/I'm the teacher you're the student/Tracks two and three are good but the rest are not congruent/write some/more songs/that don't sound like s***/you're turning things around/stop turning things around
1,Garbage!,"This is probably the worst CD i have ever owned, i didn't even bother selling it! I just threw it off a cliff. Just listen to the songs and then realize the following. (A) Nobody in the band has any musicial skills. (B) The songs all sound exactly the same. (C) The lyrics are simply bad. and i mean really bad. To surmise my review, never buys this cd ever, you will regret it for the rest of your life."
3,Not their best,"I think of EVE6 in the top three of my favorite bands, however they haven't had anything new for quite some time now. This CD, good, however is not their best effort. There is no song that completely sticks out and grabs you, they are all 3 star songs, across the board. Good music if you want to have some background music to listen to while studying, working out, or doing other work. It will not completely grab your attention or distract you from what your original task was. Good music, not their best. Coming from a fan who looks to see more from this group who should be more popular, seeing how much they sound like Green Day and the success they have had, but with this short CD doesn't do it."
2,A band with decent sound.,"A few of these songs are okay. The band as a whole has talent and can play, but the lyrics to mature a little. The music isn't very complicated. They will get better though."
3,"Good, but not great","This is a good CD, probably worth getting just for ""Inside Out,"" which was a great song. This rest of the CD is ok, but not stupendous. What this band does have is potential. Some bands do great in thier first album, some just show signs of impending greatness. Eve 6 does just this. If you really like ""Inside Out"" buy the CD, otherwise, go get Third Eye Blind to content yourself and wait for the next one."
5,Danielle From PA,"I went to see eve6 in concert and they really rock!! I decided to get the CD and i still can't get enough of it. It is really addictive. I can listen to it 50 or more times in a row and not get sick of it!! It is really great. All the songs have really powerfull lyrics. It is sooo cool! It is a must have if u like the song ""Inside Out"""
4,Hard not to biased one way or the other...,"I have read all of Marcus Borg's books and some of Crossan's. The somewhat flippant comment by Mclelland about Crossan, is *not* an accurate portrayal of what they know and believe about Jesus. I suggest the reader do their own reading of these authors and draw their own conclusions."
5,it does the job,"I have used the machine 3 times with grapefruits, carrots and oranges. There is no problem up to this point.Easy to clean.Fresh orange juice just got easier..."
2,ok but .,"you get what you invest .Ok , but to much foam . used fruit only .Price ok . Quality fair ."
2,Black n white bleaching cream,It started to work it seemed and peel skin.. then it stopped working.. It don't recommend this product at all... to me it does not work!!
4,Works well .. but use sunblock!,"I use this product off and on for a scar (pigmentation) on my hand from an oven burn. When I am consistent, it works well. But if I miss a dose, or go out in sun without sun block, (usually when driving), the pigment comes back with a vengeance! So, I guess if one is consistent and uses sunblock religiously, or avoids total sun... it can work pretty fast! It is only 2%, but I did notice a change sooner than I imagined."
3,"Not a bad trip, just so-so","i enjoyed seeing this movie. it reminded me of the way things were back in the '60s. those days were fun while they lasted, but i can't say i miss the hippie lifestyle."
4,Great Video but which zone?,A very great video and fast delivery to Europe.The only point I forgot to check was the ZONE PROTECTION of the video. I had to change the ZONE PROTECTION of my computer to read it from EUROPE(2) TO USA(1). And this operation can't be done more than 5 times.Isn't it possible to sell this kind of item in different ZONES CODES (1-2-3 ...)?TY
4,Ken Kesey for ever,"It is difficult to rank such a film, but I am afraid to say the magic was lost in the anarchic mood of its authors. Those who want to know about what happened in the legendary bus should preferably buyThe Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test- Tom Wolfe best book. This film is exclusively aimed at people who have read the book and want to get a few images of what it was to be young in 1967 and to follow Ken Kesey and his band the Merry Pranksters - with Neal Cassady driving the bus while smoking grass... This is not a work of art, not even a documentary, but an anthropological artifact. For those who accept these restrictions, go for it and buy (or steal) the DVD. I loved it!"
2,what a long forgotten trip it must have been...,"...and though they all look like they're having a fun, silly, nonsensical time, the experiment didn't work. I wish it was more clear the trail that they blazed, but they come across as disinterested and ignoring the glorious surroundings around them. What a shame.P.S. I like the mythical Dean Moriarity better than the speed freak drivin' the bus and not makin' any sense."
1,Completely squandered opportunity,"It is hard to imagine a more square, less ""on-the-bus"" narrative of Kesey & the Pranksters than this film. It is as if it were produced by Nancy Reagan.Kesey, Cassidy, the Pranksters, even Allen Ginsberg are all painted in a condescending light as a bunch of drug addicts and losers.The footage of Neal Cassidy (which is one of the only reasons to watch this film) is almost all sped up so we rarely get to see him as he was. We only hear about him being a speed freak and then watch sped up footage of him acting accordingly.The sad-sack lame light that Kesey is put in for not completing a third Great American Novel is ludicrous. How many people write one novel on the level of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""?The movie barely gives any context to the trip the Pranksters took. And if you are looking for a modicum of intelligent thought on the use of psychedelics then you should read Robert Anton Wilson and let this movie rot in the Netflix trash heap."
3,Where is the USA Blu-Ray Version?,"I see this will be released in the UK as blu-ray on November 28, they even have a US flag on the cover of their version! Why no blu-ray version for the USA where it all happened?"
2,strictly for nostalgia value,"This is one of those things (the film) that was never going to live up to the hype. A lost documentary of the events in the mid-1960s sounds great in theory. But in reality is a bunch of old damaged home movies thrown together decades after the fact. I suspect that it will be a profitable mine in the future for clips to be used in other documentaries but as a work itself, its nothing special. Will be enjoyed for nostalgia value but not a interesting documentery in itself."
4,"Better late than never, great 'you are there' perspective",Not sure what to expect given how long this film took to be released. But it is so much better than expected given the vast quanties of LSD consumed! Felt like on the bus and added great imagery to what I have read. Anyone into how the 60s acid tests came about should get this film.
4,Seeing is Remembering,"What happened in the 1960's that made it so 60's? This film reminded me that the underworld of the 60's began with events and not dates; something happened that shifted culture, viewpoints, and created reverberations that we continue to experience at present. To those who don't mind watching scratchy, old film footage shot by amateurs and spliced together some 40 years later, this is an opportunity to experience an event that obviously sparked the classic flower power culture-up close and personal. Like many documentaries this priceless glimpse into an influential moment in time requires some determination, don't expect easy entertainment. I loved it for its time capsule significance."
4,A piece of history for me,"When I heard this DVD was out I immediately bought it. From when I first read The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Trip, through all the Grateful Dead years and biographies, The Bus Trip has been a part of the history I associated myself with. Did I experience any revelations watching it? No, but that doesn't detract from its importance as a documentary of the event. In fact, it puts it in perspective. It was cramped, there were fights, people dropped off along the way (I was very surprised one of the featured characters didn't even make the trip back). But it was cool to see, and in fact I would have liked to see more (I think they shot 30 hours of film). Frankly, seeing and hearing Neal made it for me. And the tiny glimpse of one of the Acid Tests. Now THAT I could have seen more of. If this era is important to you, buy it."
2,Wanted Something Nice,"After using a cheap set of Koss Sparkplugs for sometime I wanted to treat myself to something nicer. The Metro.fi 2 would seem to be a nice step up from what I had and they were. Sure there was the breakin time and the time it took to get use to putting the product in my ears. I liked the sound that the Metro.fi 2 provided from my MP3 player.Here's what I didn't like about the product, the latter causing me to return them. When walking in cold weather, the thick wires are very stiff and get in the way of everything. Yeah, I know that they are thick for a reason, still not all of us live in a warm climate 365 days a year. After about a week of using them, the left channel became muffled. I first thought that maybe it was 'ear by-product' (wax), but after a good cleaning of both ear and product the issue remained. I even waited a day or so and tried it again, still no joy. So, I choose to return the product for a refund because Amazon had none in stock the trade out."
2,"Sound great, terrible fit!","These sound great. But there are two major issues that were deal breakers for me. First, the cord is way too thick and stiff. The stiffness causes the ear buds to easily lift out of your ears during normal use. Second, although four different sizes of ear bud are included, none of them fit my average ears well. Also, the ear bud material is somewhat rigid and becomes uncomfortable after a while."
3,"Decent quality sound, not comfortable","These have a good sound range (clear trebles, nice bass) when you can get a good seal in your ear, but the frame of the earbud is so bulky that they tend to want to come out of your ears as you walk. Also, the cord is very stiff, leading to more ""fall out"" problems when snagged on the zipper of your jacket or your backpack strap."
3,Cords alittle too stiff,"Sound is good. They pop out of my ears sometimes. What bothers me is the cord is very thick and stiff. Doesn't easily fold up to put in your pockets. When their in your ears the cord sticks out awkwardly,instead of laying flat against you. I been using my 20 dollar j-buds more latly because of the cord."
2,Too Much Treble - Sounds Tinny,I was disappointed in the sound of these earphones which seemed tinny as a result of too much treble. My $14 Koss phones have a much better sound so I returned the Ultimate Ears.
1,Going Back - NO Bass,"Just got a pair for Christmas from my daughter who spent $50 of her hard-earned dollars on these ""high-end"" earphones. Tried them out with an iPod Shuffle and MacBook Pro. THERE'S NO BASS!!!Tried my original iPod earphones as well as Sony MDR W08 for comparison and both blew away this junk. These sound tinny and should be selling for about $1 not $50.The five-star reviews are obviously by company shills.Going back to Amazon tomorrow."
3,They don't fit me well.,"I'll preface this by saying that my ears are very hard to fit. They are on the large side, and most earbuds simply pop out of my ears each time I turn my head.I bought these Metro.fi 2's because of the good reviews. They are packaged extremely well, have great build quality, and the sound is very good.But for me, even with the largest of the 3 ear flanges, they are not big enough to fit my ears with a good seal. The largest rubber tip is just a bit too small.I tried all sizes of the included rubber ear tips. I tried the smaller ones, and tried jamming them deep into my ears. They popped out right out.I tried the large ones, and had the same problem. They dont stay in.I was very disappointed. I really wanted these to fit me. I love the quality and sound of these. The look is great and the cord is thick and long.They even come with a leather case.Too bad the dont stay in my ears.Earphone manufacturers need to include a larger variety of eartip sizes for us big folks."
4,High quality earphones,"I got this as a replacement for the earbuds included with my iPod that were broken (my fault). I never use an ""in ear"" buds before, i mean, some that get fully IN your ears, so, when i use this for the first time i was a little bit uncomfortable but everything goes fine after a few days using it. I'm a music fan, not a sound expert so i won't speak about technnical specs, i just have to say that the Metro fi.2 have a very good sound quality, you can ear every little detail in music, even things that you doesn't note before (sincerily), there's no distortion at all, and the exterior noise reduction is very good (i use it in a flight and barely listen the engine noise). The iPod earphones are fine, but if you want to try something a little bit better for a reasonbale price this is a very good option.Pedro S."
2,sounded good but stopped working; replacement did too!!,I bought these earphones after reading lots of reviews and because of an excellent price on Amazon. I really liked the sound quality and the substantial wires didn't tangle. After two months the left ear plug stopped working - no sound. I contacted Ultimate Ears as they are still under warranty. They have a pretty simple process for returns which I am in the process of doing. We'll see how it goes. Hoping that some new ones will last considerably longer.ack theUpdate December 2007. My second pair just failed. The first pair failed in about 2 months and was replaced (without any trouble) by Ultimate Ears. I am about to send back the replacement set - again after less than 3 months of light use. Both times one of the earbuds just stopped producing any sound!!! I am 50+ years old and use these lighly and sporadically - they aren't used every day or abused. This time I am asking for a refund so I can purchase something a bit more durable!!
2,Terrible for such expensive headphones,"I paid $60 for these and have had them maybe 3 months. At first i liked them, the sound quality was always just okay. There is little to no low end on these things but im not a bass head so that was okay. Then they started to slip out of my ears more and more. Next, the left bud got really faint, so much so you could barely hear it unless you cranked the volume would make the right one blare into your ear. Not good. The cord is also very stiff and the buds(phones themselves) are quite heavy. I just purchased the Sony MDR EX-75 earbuds for half that price and the sound quality is amazing. Much better bass, and great stereo effect that makes you feel immersed in the music, not distant like another reviewer said of the metro 2s. Save yourself some money and just buy some Sony ex75's. You'll be much happier. The only thing nice about the metro 2's is the small leather velcro case."
2,Poor fit...always drop out...,"They just drop out all the time from the ears.Totally unusable when standing (walking, etc..)Moreover I had two times such an ear irritation caused by these earplugs, that I had to go to doctor and take drugs (ok,ok, i didn't disinfected them, that was also probably the cause). When this happend me for a second time (even after desinfection), i said, ok, i will never use them.I have to say, that when I holded them in my ears, they have TERRIFIC SOUND (better than sure e2c). What a pity, that they don't fit me.Overally: I do not recommend to purchase it without trying out them first in a studio.p.s.: i had no similiar problems with shure e2c, probably because they had a soft fit).UPDATE: i just realized that one of the speakers is not working. just after less then one years?! i didn't even use these and always kept the cable properly! definitely do not recommed these one"
4,A salsa legend pays tribute to a bolero legend.,"Legendary salsa sonero Hector Lavoe paid a moving tribute to the legendary bolerista Felipe Pirela on this 1977 release. Hector did quite a good job interpreting these songs and the whole album feels unified. I failed to give it a 5-star rating because Hector was'nt a ""Natural-born"" bolero singer(but it's still among his best mid-'70s works)."
5,Very Pleased,"Small, plug and play on my mac, and works without external power. Very portable, and comes with cables that should allow you to use any interface."
2,Not exactly as pictured,"The caps I received did not have a hex head hole in the middle of the cap. Mine have a long slot for removal with a large flat screw driver or a coin. Not as nice in my opinion as the hex head, but probably less prone to stripping. I'd return them except that they were so cheap."
3,Learning Tabla with Alla Rakha,I just bought this book and Video tape - and I must say that it is not fair that the publisher has not made some efforts to edit this book properly - for $50 I feel like cheated. Alla Rakha is master of Tabla - but his publisher is very dubious - and Video tape in this time of digital audio/video is dubious too. Very bad quality of the book and video material - Ithink that the publisher should and must pay in better way his gratitude to the great tabla player and Guruji Alla Rakha.
1,Dissapointing,"I was really excited to get this video and waited awhile for it to be available for purchase. Unfortunately, the quality is very low. Firstly, the book is very poorly printed. Most of the images and illustrations in the book so fuzzy that you can barely make out what it's trying to convey. The video, which is what I was most excited about, is horrible quality. It looks like they took a YouTube video and put it on a VHS. Really poor video quality and the audio is just as bad. Even though there are close mics shown, the audio sounds very echoey; like they had the mics up in the rafters. Worse still, the audio isn't completely in sync with the video! For a video that's trying to convey percussion technique, this is ridiculous.Don't waste your money."
2,poor physical quality,"Nothing negative to say about the content of this learning tool...it was recorded before the advent of digital media. It's wonderful to have a recording of Ustadji teaching step by step. However, it does not do justice to the great Ustad Alla Rakha to have this product not updated so that the media is converted to VCD and the book reproduced with some quality. My copy of the book arrived stamped improperly so that pages were falling out. I asked for and got a replacement but that one was also defective. It's not worth holding onto in this condition. They both went back for a refund."
4,My introduction to Cindy Harris,and I will be reading more. Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Highly recommend.
4,She Had to Seduce Him,"Camilla knew she should be scandalized by the command to beguile Wickingham Castle's newest guest, but seeing as she'd already been pinned beneath the handsome knight's large body and felt his hot flesh pressed against her own, she could hardly muster up any indignation. And giving in to her desire for the man would result in a greater good. A Justice of the King's Bench, Sir Stevyn Strongbow had come to destroy a man whom Camilla knew to be a saint, a bishop who had saved her from perdition. If she could sway Stevyn from prosecuting the innocent priest, she would be doing God's will. But if the bishop was blameless, why had she been asked to resort to seduction and lies? Camilla knew she must learn for herself. And in her quest, the beauty feared that her greatest obstacle would be her greatest temptation: Sir Stevyn, a man of strong convictions."
2,Product of the times...,"Back in the late 1980's and early 1990's, there was a disturbing trend among some jazz artists to incorporate drum machines, sequencers and cheesy sounding sampled instruments instead of using organic instruments, possibly to lower costs. While these changes might have caused less problems personally and gave the music a 'hip' feeling, these recordings sound unbelievably dated a simple fifteen years later. On this album, Kim Pensyl attempts to cover a Babyface song with the aforementioned instrumentation, and the result fails miserably. Fortunately not every song on this CD is like this, and it is at these moments (like the wonderful 'Say You Will') that he adopts a more organic feel, thus giving this song a truly timeless quality. If you are a fan of less-than-organic jazz, feel free to purchase. Otherwise, try downloading."
5,Great Movie,I ordered this for my daughter. She said it was fantastic. I will see it when she comes home for Spring Break. It arrived in great condition and on time. Thanks!
5,A Must See!,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies! Janet McTeer was absolutely wonderful (not to mention Academy Award deserving!) and Kimberly J. Brown's performance was fabulous. This movie shows the beauty of a mother-daughter relationship. It will make you cry, it will make you laugh (especially the final scene!) and it will most definetly make you feel good after watching it. I recommend this movie to be seen by all!! (Since some of the other reviews have given a synopsis of the film, I chose just to add my two cents, rather than giving the run down!)"
4,Great performances in true to life tale,TUMBLEWEEDS * * * 1/2 A few months in the life of a flighty single mom and her more sensible young daughter. Performances by Oscar nominated Janet McTeer and KimberlyJ Brown are terrific.
2,Ernest Had a Sister,"Title for this movie could be ""Ernest Had a Sister"". The late Jim Varney (Ernest)has close competition from the McTeer character. Or maybe you could call this an aquarium movie, because it is like watching fish swim stupidly around in circles. Kimberly Brown's Ava character carries the movie, especially in the scene in the motor home with Gavin O'Connor. Lot of people like this movie and I wouldn't want to detract from that, but I see enough of these idiots in real life to not want to watch a film about them."
2,Unremarkable film of mother-daughter bonding,I suppose this is the sort of film that mothers and daughters love but that leaves men cold. I wasn't impressed by McTeer's Oscar nominated performance nor with the film itself. I found it derivative and pointless. I guess you had to have been there.
5,I LOVED THIS MOVIE!,"Tumbleweeds was a brilliant film. Both Janet McTeer and Kimberly Brown were outstanding as a mother and daugther travelling pretty much across country and running away from mean boyfriends. It is a great story of a relationship between mother and daughter, and not only is Mary Jo a great mother but she is also a great friend to her daughter. This film made me laugh alot. There is alot of humor to it. I rented the DVD, and after the ending(which i loved, that's all i will say about it), I watched it w/ the audio commentary for awhile, and it's a great way to learn more about the whole process of film making, and I would not have known that the director/writer of the film had also acted in it. I recommend this film to all, It's a must see!"
3,Not Great,The winch is doing it's job but not sure for how long. Have already replaced 2 cables as they corrode right away. Would like to have a level wind as cable binds up in spool. With load on unable to guide cable. After install first unit defective but company took care and replaced unit. Don't think unit can pull it's weight unless on flat ground with overinflated tires.I am using to pull 300lbs vertical so not sure how long will last. Lots of corrosion on spool and rollers. Unit kept covered and used in Southern CA.
2,It works but barely,"It does not pull its rated load. Its been four months and it still works, but if you are searching for a specific load calculate about half of what they claim. This unit is more designed for pulling a small 3000 lb car rolling in neutral up a low ramp. If you need more than that go elsewhere"
1,Is this picture Welch Allyn 11820 PanOptic Ophthalmoscope ? Isn't it?,"I think that is wrong picture.Coaxial Opthalmosope is small one.Is this picture Welch Allyn 11820 PanOptic Ophthalmoscope ?Isn't it?If I order this one, would you send me this one with PanOptic Ophthalmoscpe?"
4,Take only what you need,"I have a 2.5 year old and a 16 month old and this bag leaves my hands free to carry them or hold hands without having to constantly adjust a bag. It is the perfect size to take just what we need and not be bogged down by an inconvient bag. The very bottom pocket is very easy to get into without taking the bag off, it's a great place for your wallet and keys. If you need to carry sippy cups and not bottles make sure they are not too tall or they won't fit in the middle compartment (which is meant for bottles) The bottle attachment is good to store snacks if you don't need to carry a bottle."
2,bad zipper,the middle back pocket broke within the first week we used the item. and were unable to fix the problem.
5,Take care of pet smells outdoors,I have used this product over 10 years. I just sprinkle it where the dog pees. I use it with and without the hot water. Seems to work both ways. I think it is great for dog runs.
5,No Odor,I used this product at least 40 years ago when I was showing and raising dogs. I recently bought a doberman and wanted to make sure there was no unpleasent odor in her run. It is a GREAT productFern
5,Quick delivery! A+ Seller,Great to do business with. Quick delivery in perfect condition. Thank you! A+A+A+ Seller!!!
1,not what i was told,people recommended this and i had high hopes i have used it in many different ways and on many different things - havent noticed any differance
2,Some dogs like flat chews and some don't. My puppy wasn't even fond of these I'm sorry to say,I have 3 dogs and one is a golden doodle who eats anything but swallows everything as soon as he can get it down his throat which means no more round rawhide. My picky dog said no right away even though I was hoping the peanut butter flavor would help. The oldest dog just took hers to guard for a few hours than abandoned it to the puppy who just couldn't wait to have two now (puppy greed). 3 hours later they are still around and almost caused a fight since the older dog just wanted to check again to see if maybe I'll give it another go (only because the puppy now had it).If your dog likes these types of chews than I say go for it. It seems mine do not. This is my 2nd flavor (different brands) and none of them seem to overly enjoy them.
3,The Great Brain himself does not appear.,"J.D.'s brother Tom, the Great Brain himself, does not appear at all in this particular book. This one takes place after Tom has left for the Catholic Academy and is mostly about J.D. trying to follow in the Great Brain's footsteps, a task that J.D. doesn't fulfill until the last chapter, which makes this one a pretty tedious read. Tom's absence leaves a gaping hole. Try to imagine if J.K. Rowling were to write another book about Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and Harry Potter is not in it. That's how boring 'Me and My Little Brain' is without Tom. But readers of the Great Brain series still shouldn't skip this one. It explains the adoption of a youngest son named Frankie, who will be mentioned in the fourth book, 'The Great Brain at the Academy.'"
1,Confusion,Don't make mistake I did. This is NOT the battery that goes in the phone. This is a charger.
4,Pretty and Practical Purchase From Amazon,Sets a pretty table. It is friendly to arthritis sufferers as it is light weight and easy to handle. It takes up less room in the dishwasher and in the cabinet. It does not break easily and does not chip. It can be used in the dishwaher and the microwave. I even put mine in a oven on a low heart setting to hold pancakes and such while I am cooking a large amount. The only drawback is food does cool on the product much faster than on stoneware or even china.
4,Corelle plates,"I'm happy with the plates I bought. However, it was hard to see that there was a scalloped pattern around the edge of the plates because they are all white. I thought they might be plain white."
5,I've always remembered it,"When I was young, my neighbor would always watch this video and I also loved to watch it. Being young, I never happened to ask what the title of the movie was. About 10 years later, one day in school the memory of that movie popped into my mind for some reason. I was determined to find out what the name of the movie was. I asked all my friends at school but they had no idea what I was talking about. Finally, one of my friends helped me find out what the name was and now I finally know the name of one of my favorite childhood movies. This movie is a great movie for a little young girl with dreams to watch. And maybe, like this movie did for me, she will have memories of for years to come."
2,Uncomfortable and too small,"I am very unhappy with this dress. It is practically too small and too short for my 28 pound daughter. The waist is so scratchy that she cries when you try to put it on. Even with a slip underneath, it hurts her waist. For a few dollars more you can buy a dress that is much more comfortable and fun to wear."
3,Look Elsewhere,"I'm sorry, I disagree that this is a good place to start with John Stewart. I don't think any of the remakes here improve on the originals. IMO, you'd be much better off with any of the double-album compilations out there, which are all 5 stars in my book. This album is worth it, though, if only for Shadows of the Angels Wings (with Nanci Griffith). And for God's sake pick up a copy of Wires From the Bunker, John's brilliant ""lost"" album."
2,Disappointment,"These are re-working of the original songs and the difference is loud and clear This is particularly noticeable on John's top hit ""Gold"" with Stevie Nicks....."
4,Good songs to listen to,Good songs.......takes me back ........my husband borrowedit and plays it alot...........so I gave it to him......
4,Best of sessions west 54th vol. 1,"A very good live dvd with a couple of artists at their top, live. Because I am a big fan of Jane Siberry this dvd came to my attention. Not only Jane Siberry is very good, but there other good performances of different artists like Daniel Lanois, Sinead O'Connor, Patti Smith etc. 17 different performances in total, different kinds of music from singer/songwriters such as Suzanne Vega, country Emmylou, wave Patti Smith to jazz with lovely music by an excellent Wynton Marsalis. The dvd is from the same quality as the live performances by the late show by Jools Holland. The dvd is also a good item to get known with lesser known artists, such as Nil Lara, Keb'Mo'. A dvd I can really give a high recommandation to every person who loves music and still wants to explore new kinds of music. Henk Coppoolse, Vlissingen, Netherlands"
3,Good but also disappointing...,I was a big fan of this show and have fond memories of watching great artist perform great sets. When I saw the line up for this DVD I jumped at the chance to watch these performances again. When the DVD arrived I was very disappointed to find out that it's only one song from each artist. I was expecting and hoping to see full sets from each artist. Why they didn't/don't have the whole show for sale (that I am aware of) I have no idea.
5,Nice DVD,"It's a pleasure to see a compilation disc that is about the music, instead of about the popularity of the artists. The sound and performances were all very good. I hope that this is the first of many DVDs to stem from this wonderful TV show."
2,"Great DVD, But Why the Cuts?","Recorded live (with a studio audience) at Sony's New York digs, the sound of this series (originally aired on PBS) is absolutely exceptional in the fully digital format. But why did they cut so much (and some of the best performances - i.e. David Bryne bouncin' and rippin' it up in a flame suit, Zap Mamma gettin' down acapella, etc) from the broadcast version of this best of? It originally aired in two one-hour parts, here we just get 70 minutes.Also, why the heck are so few of the individual performances available? It's a crime to keep these from the pubic! (They are currently airing the series on cable's TRIO channel, but on my cable system the sound and video quality bites. I don't know if that's because they are using poor quality masters or because my cable company isn't devoting sufficient bandwidth for the channel.) If anyone knows who should be peppered with letters or email at Sony to get the DVD's flowing, please share the info here."
1,Terrible invasion by Kindle - updating purchased book without prior consent,"I was reading and highlighting passages as I went along so I could go back to the historical references at a later time. After reading about 60%, I turned on the Kindle and found that all my highlights and bookmarks had disappeared. The Kindle Help representative advised me that the e-book, which I had purchased from Amazon some months before, had been updated (i.e., AMAZON DELETED THE VERSION I WAS READING -- WITHOUT MY CONSENT - AND REPLACED IT WITH A NEW VERSION). The highlights and bookmarks I had made in my version were gone forever. Further, Amazon would/could not advise me what pages had being updated. I FIND IT OUTRAGEOUS FOR AMAZON/KINDLE TO REACH INTO MY DEVISE AND EXTRACT A PRODUCT I LAWFULLY PURCHASED!! Would they come into my house in the middle of the night and sneakily replace a hard copy book I purchased from themThe Source: A Novel?"
1,Not helpful for medical advice.,The book was very disappointing. We bought this book thinking it would help in identifying medical-related issues with our kids and they grew up. Instead much of the book is about how to parent. We are not wanting the AAP's opinions on parenting.Don't waste you money. There are better parenting books out there.
2,Not worth it -- good descriptions of some medical problems,"Toss it out. It's a reference book, if even that. It'll end up in your library or garage sale.The previous book about infants to toddlers was an excellent guide book for parents, but this one is such a disappointment. I guess the kids grow at different rate, and more divergence begin to emerge at over five, I suppose -- but the book doesn't even say that. Had a lot of info about different medical conditions, etc -- something easily found on internet. Rather than describing what each age may experience in their school, peers, etc., or a ""guide"" book for parents, this book gave me nothing -- and I only have one child and wanted desperately to have a good ""guide"" book."
3,Not as good as the first book in the series,"When my kids were younger, I relied on the first book in the American Academy of Pediatrics's series, Caring for Your Baby and Young Child, when my children were ill and when I had questions about whether they were growing and developing ""normally."" I thought this book would be similar, but cover older kids. It doesn't! As the Amazon review above mentions, discussions of childhood illnesses and injuries are kept to a minimum. Almost any time one of my kids has a symptom or illness and I'm wondering if it is serious enough to require a visit to the doctor, the book has little or nothing to say on the subject. Instead, there are lengthy discussions of things like ADHD and learning disabilities that you might never encounter in your kids, as well as info. on taking care of your kids' emotional health. Useful information, but not what I wanted when I bought a book from the APA!"
3,Great record but poor sound!,"The remastering process hasn't been kind to this classic recording. It sounds muffled and tiny - nothing like the vinyl or, sad to say, its first cd reincarnation. Obviously, the folks at quality control let this one get by. Whatever source material Emusica used for this reissue still does not exculpate the remaster engineer for doing such a lousy job.Informed sources tell me that there was talk of giving this cd a ""face-lift"" sometime in the future. But don't hold your breath. Until then, this is all we have."
1,De Ti Depende,The RP has more sons then this CD. This CD has only 8 songs and it is expensive. What a rip off.
1,De Ti Depende-Terrible remastering,"Codigo did a terrible job on this remastered CD. Fania should really get it together and solve this issue. This is the third time being remastered and each time it gets worst. They cant seem to get it right.This such a beautiful album, but the sound quality is horrible. I peronally had to transfer from vinyl to digital to get the right sound. And everyone know how much of a pain in the tail it is to filter out a vinyl record.I dont know if they are using a tape to do the job, maybe a vinyl i dont know. one this is for sure its not from the master disc. I can tell immediately from the poor sound quality.For anyone looking to just have it and collectors go ahead. But it wont meet your demands if you have great ears."
5,salsa y de la gorda,"lavoe es y sera siempre uno de mis idolos, que pena que hallan hecho una pelicula tan pobre sobre el. para aquellos fanaticos que dices que el es el cantante de los cantantes y hablan que nadie se puede parar al lado en voz, oigan musica de Benny More para que vean lo que es ser privilegeado."
2,Disappointed,MamboCha's review was right on the money.It is a shame that Emusica releases this item with such lousy sonics.It sounds muffled and without the dynamics that the original CD or vinyl had.To add insult to injury the artwork used on this CD is pretty cheesy since it appears that they got an LP from a flea market and they blacked out the price tag with a black magic marker (See upper right corner of the cover). They could have used the artwork from the original CD.Avoid this item unless you do not have the old CD!!!
5,If you like Pat Metheny...,"This CD got no airplay and is on a small label. This is not a formula for success in the music world. There is a picture of the 4-man group on the reverse side of the CD case and they look more like a Heavy Metal band than an exceptionally talented jazz ensemble. Musically this CD is a rare find. All of the cuts are keepers and the compositions and performances are spectacular. They are a bit reminiscent of Pat Metheny at his best without (hold your breath Metheny fans!) the boring bits in between the genius. My favorite track is ""For M. J."" it rips and is very innovative. The only regret that you may have after securing a copy is that you won't find another CD by the same group, however, if you do please drop me a line."
5,Greatest pair of shoes I've ever bought.,I LOVE these shoes. They are better than they looked online. These shoes look and feel great. These are the best shoes I've ever bought!
5,Kind of messy...but Betta loves them!,"These can get easily messy when you're breaking a piece of the blood worm pack off to thaw, but other than that this are great. My King Betta went bananas after trying one of these. I held one out side of the tank and he swam back and forth faster than ever, and he jumps out of the water like mad when I hold them above the water. Definitely recommend these as a treat for your betta."
4,One of the most original bands around,"Bands do have to grow and mature, and this is a great example of one of this decades most original bands trying new things - and succeeding for the most part. I suspect that many of those who panned the CD are stuck on the first CD, rather than appreciating the development of this unique group."
3,Not his usual great stuff,"Perhaps I missed the boat, but this didn't grab me. ""Under the Table and Dreaming,"" is perhaps the best album of the 90's, and ""Crash,"" was a great follow-up. This one didn't have the catchy riffs and a lot of the tunes were hard to follow. Of course, I'm more pop oriented than alternative oriented.I'm a huge DMB fan, but I felt a little let down on this one. I'm expecting better things in the future from Dave and his great band.Sorry I disagree with most of the reviewers here. I thought it was a sub-par effort for these guys."
1,One of the worst excuses for music I have ever heard,"Total unmitigated crap--no melody, just a constant cacophany of meandering unstructured noise. It totally sucks"
3,Good DMB,"This is a good DMB CD, but not the upbeat type his first two albums were. I'd suggest checking out his first two albums before buying this if you aren't already a DMB fan. If you like his other stuff this CD is certainly for a fan."
1,I'm ready for the prom,"This CD is so great, especially if you are a sadomasochist. When I hear this album I get all warm and fuzzy, probably because I'm burning in hell whenever I DO hear it. There is no album more perfect than this one - for driving holed-up terrorists crazy. Seriously though, if you've heard one Dave Matthews CD you've heard EVERY Dave Matthews CD. The piercing vocals and the chalkboard squeak strings will give a boost to the pharmacuetical industry - the headaches I got from this one still haven't gone away."
