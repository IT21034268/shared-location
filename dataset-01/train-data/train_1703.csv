5,Takes a licking....Keeps on ticking,"This monitor gets 5 stars, but Amazon gets minus 5 stars for its care in shipping. UPS was in danger of a law suit. The package arrived looking like it had been hauled over the Rockies on a coal train. The box had apparently been ripped open and the top was folded together to keep it closed. Luckily nothing was missing and there were no signs of dings on the outside of the monitor. With some trepidation I plug it in and power up. Voila. Its beautiful! This monitor performs very very well and apparently is very rugged. I ordered it based on the below reviewers comments and because Amazon was offering free shipping. Kudos to the reviewer but caveat emptor when Amazon offers free shipping."
5,"Superb Image, reasonable size, simple controls, Buy it!","I've owned and used several 21"" monitors over the years and by far this monitor for the money beats anything currently at its price level. I took a big chance on this monitor and ordered it sight unseen. I'll tell you it was a good choice for the price. The Image was sharp corner to corner, small text was crisp and the colors were quite pleasing. The monitor has a rather small footprint compared to other 21"" monitors and puts out very little heat when in use. The contols are simple and easy to use and you will be up and running with in minutes of removing it from the box. While they claim this screen to be flat (which it is to some degree) it is not a perfectly flat screen. I do believe that NEC has a winner here!"
2,Are there any heterosexuals still alive?,"Way too much male homosexual stuff. Maybe that means there are more men paying men for sex these days. I don't know the answer to that question. I like the frankness of the writing and the psychology of the book, but I think I spent too much money for this one."
1,Be forewarned,"I thought I was getting an all metal, blue bank. I got an ugly pastel purple bank with purple sparkles on the door that looked like someone just threw them on there. I am very displeased. I was told I could return it (and possibly get the exact same thing back) but unfortunately for me and the little boy I was getting this for, it will not be here until way after Christmas."
2,Very dissapointing.,"I received this for Christmas from my Wish List. The reviews were decent. After the first 30 seconds I was annoyed. Teh video and audio were out of synch. Since I didn't see this in other reviews I'm assuming that was my laptop's problem. I have not had a chance to watch it another way yet. The next thing that cropped up as I tried to ignore the synch issue was his personality and jokes. Not my style. Given the fact that I would expect anyone to have to watch this repeatedly before learning all of it I can't imagine hearing his quips over and over. My third discovery, and last since I shut it off after this, was that his fingering and camera angles made it almost impossible to see where he was playing. I will say that I am a beginner so this might not be so bad for more accomplished players. I couldn't tell if his second finger was playing notes or hovering over not and it blocked what his first finger was doing fairly often.I wish could return it."
3,Koch is an ass but the instruction is good,"Greg Koch needs a complete personality transplant - he is as big an ass as I have ever seen. His peronality made it hard for me to watch the instruction. I don't know how his band members can stand working with him - even with his considerable talent. Having said that - his SRV is dead-on and the instruction is good - not great - but good. I don't know why anyone expected SRV video on this DVD but it would have been cool. So, all in all, I am glad I have this DVD but I feel I payed too much for it. It's not worth more than $10."
3,what would stevie think?,this is ok but not at all one of my favoties. i agree where is stevie? shouldnt he had been on here i know he did some teaching stuff so dont tell they couldnt have put him on here
3,Doesn't explain enough,"Although he is a very good guitar player, my biggest complaint is that he doesn't explain enough how to play it. He basically goes through it once and then plays it at more or less full speed. I'm at least an intermediate guitar player and I have trouble following along with him. The close ups aren't really close ups and you can't really tell what he is doing or what strings/ frets he is playing. It is helpful to see someone playing the songs as far as the learning process goes so I do like that, but again as I said he just doesn't explain enough of it in detail or take much time. To me it feels as though it is a very rushed lesson. Don't have time to actually learn it. While I'm figuring out one part he's already two parts ahead. I know it's a DVD but it would have helped to at least include TAB for the parts that he is teaching."
2,Imperial Trooper,"It is disappointing that this guy has no weapon - just his box... Perhaps he can drop it on an Ewok! Paint job is ok - lots of weathering, The emperor will not be happy to see his troops dirty."
4,Nice for bedroom stereo,I like to put this stereo in my bedroom because the size is not too big for a stereo that has a Mega Bass Sound System. I can listen to any kind of music I like because it has 4 pattern electronic sound that allows me to select an appropriate sound adjustment setting for listening to various different types of music. It also has a 5-Band Graphic Equalizer that lets me modify the sound levels plus-or-minus 10dB at five center frequencies to suit different types of music and room acoustics
3,"2,3,4","I love the incredible abs exercises. I thought this DVD was the entire collection because it doesn't say otherwise and I tried to read reviews and I still couldn't find out. Now that I own it I see that it is Incredicle Abs 2, 3, and 4. My fav's are 2 and 6 so I guess atleast I got 2 but they really should specify what you are getting. I think it's effective when added to an exercise routine and do recommend, just wish I could get the entire series instead of just a few."
5,How I got flat abs,"This workout is a MUST for anybody who is serious about losing weight and getting a sexy, flat stomach. My middle has always been a problem area, so when I found this DVD I immediately tried it out. This is THE BEST ab series that I have done on DVD. I've taken classes at the the gym and this blows them all out of the water - and for $14.98. That's way cheaper than a gym membership :-)Incredible Abs Series"
4,V. Helpful Collection,"Hadfield's anthology offers lots of digestible morsels from important primary sources. This book serves well to introduce some of the key players in early modern travel writing, and Hadfield's introductory matter (for the book as a whole and for each categorical subset he offers) provides clues about current critical preoccupations. Of course, the problem with such an anthology is that it can only give snippets, but Hadfield's choice to cover a wide range of primary selections makes for a volume of breadth if not always depth. That said, sometimes reading more than a short extract of some of the authors in this edition can cause sudden sleep syndrome anyway, so I also respect the snippet form. On the whole, a very helpful guidebook for those interested in exploring early modern travel writing and a gateway to further reading on the topic. Excellent for use in a college or grad level seminar."
1,Dissatisfied with product,"I ordered repositionable Staedtler drafting dots and was sent ""Thru DD10"" repositionable drafting dots. The Thru DD-10 are awful, they are not repositionable, they tear your paper, do not just come off, and when they do come off they leave psrt of the dot behind and the adhesive. Awful product I can not write enough negative comments about the ""Thru DD-10"" product. I have used Staedtler products and was very satisfied. When I received the ""Thru DD-10"" product I thought it would be equal to the Staedtler product, not true. I would not order from this seller again because they did not send me what I ordered but a substitute. Extrememly disappointed in the product I received."
3,"5 Stars for the music, 2 for the bonus","I love the music and if you don't own this music buy it now. My issue is the Bonus interviews. Why on Disc One prior to the last set of additional songs. In addition, I would have loved to see some live music included as a bonus. I know the vaults have something."
3,Necessary only for completists,"Hearing Gram's voice always brings a smile to one's face, but this set is only essential for completist; there are no major revelations here. General listeners should stick to the earlier CD issue that combined Gram's two solo albums on one disks."
4,Fabulous,What a great introduction [for me] to this artist - I felt as though he approached his music more for himself than for his fans and it's a shame that he didn't have his personal life in the same order.
3,Complete? Yes and No!,"Having been treated to so many outstanding career retrospective CD boxsets over the past twenty-four years, we've come to expect several things from such compilations: 1. Remastered tracks; 2. Outtakes and demos; 3. Insights into the creation of the music through studio chatter, false starts and mistakes; 4. Rarities and previously unreleased songs. How does this set stack up? It is reasonable in the first and second instance, but has nothing in the third and fourth areas. Do these things exist? Previous bootlegs and a rare out-of-print ""Cosmic American Cowboy"" collection say so. So, what we have are the two original Gram Parsons solo albums, an interesting and likely incomplete set of outtakes, and some teasers from interviews and radio performance. For the novice, this box is probably too much (stick with the previous Gram Parson anthology!) and for the diehard fan, there is just not enough."
3,never heard of these guys,"never heard of this album but what the hell, this albums seriously rocks. your anus with pucker and unpucker to the beat of your meat...if that helps"
4,2008 Frontier antenna adapter harness,"Harness worked well, once I figured out that the second wire had no purpose. No instructions with the harness, so no way of figuring out the dummy wire."
5,a must have,"you're going to need this adapter for sure, does not come with instruction for the blue wire but found it on youtube."
2,Poor connection,Poor connector. I have the blue cable connected to my remote power which works fine. However from time to time my radio would shut off usually after a bump in the road. Figuring something was loose I tested all the connections and discovered that the plug into the nissan plug goes out depending on how it wiggles. I bent the pin a little but to make sure it has full contact which seems to make it better but still goes out from time to time.
3,"Okay, I suppose.","Pullman sets up a tight and interesting mystery but it is quite predictable. Though I enjoyed it (Pullman is good at bringing out his characters' weaknesses which lends depth to their personalities), I found myself thinking about what I would be read next."
4,Very enjoyable.,A gutsy young woman who finds brave and loyal friends; what more can one ask. This is no mild kids book and there are plenty of evil characters and violent death. But it was an enjoyable story and I admit being curious to see where it goes from here.
3,The Ruby in the Smoke,The Ruby in the Smoke was full of excitment. There were many twists and turns and betrayals of friends. Sally uncovers many secrets and mysteries of hers and others mysterious pasts. She is joined on her adventures by quite a few friends who she meets along the way. Sally is a very kind and caring young woman who is always eager to help others out when they need it. Due to her loveable personality and her outstanding intelligence she is able to figure out the mysteries left to her after her father's murder. She uses her courage to stand up to evil and win.
5,GREAT!,"Just months after her fathers death 16 year old Sally Lockheart receved a letter from the east. It said""Sali, Bware of the seven blessings, Marchbanks will help, Chattum."" That note was how Sally found her friend Jim, her lover Fredrick,her real father and the ruby of argarpur. I won't go too far into the story but at the end a little girl, Adelaide Bevan dissapears. To find out where she went read the Tin Princess. AFTER YOU READ THIS BOOK READ SHADOW IN THE NORTH AND TIGER IN THE WELL THEN THE TIN PRINCESS. YOU MUST DO THIS FO YOUR OWN GOOD! =)"
3,Not His Style!!!!,"When Philip Pullman was writing this series I think he was experimenting with different genres of book . His writing prowess does not extend into the mystery section and I don't recommend this book. I'm not criticizing him as a writer and if you want a good read I suggest you look into his later novels, For instance His Dark Materials."
1,Terrible!!!,"'The Ruby in the Smoke' is a book that I will never read again! I admit that the first few chapters were quite good, but I'm afraid the rest was not impessive! Sorry, Mr. Pullman, but I do not recommend this book!"
2,Definitely Young Adult Material!,"I am a librarian at a private elementary/junior high school. I purchased this book based on Pullman's very uplifting series ""His Dark Materials."" Although this book is well crafted, I was disturbed that Sally eventually solves the mystery by smoking opium. What message are we sending our youngsters? I am also aware that in further books in this series, Sally becomes a young, unwed mother. I'm sorry, but there's no place for this series in my library."
1,Terrible,Terrible. Awful book. I had to read 3 summer reading books and that was one and it was the worst...ever. Terrible. Don't buy it for leisure.
4,An exellent book with well developed characters,"This book was fairly complicated, and there were some parts I had to read three or four times in order to understand some crucial point, but in general it was a good book with characters that felt real right away. I am generaly not an avid mystery story reader, so this book being the first in a long time was a bit confusing in the beginning, though I very quickly was swept up in the story. This book had good, true to life characters, though in my opinion not enough descriptions of the scenery. The basic plot was, sixteen year old Sally Lockhart goes in search of what a cryptic message she recieved concerning her fathers recent death may mean. On the way she meets some charming new friends and discovers some fascinating truths about herself. So, this book was not as good as The Golden Compass by the same author, but still interesting enough to make me want to read the rest of the series."
4,Inthralling,"This first book of the Sally Lockheart trillogy is the 2nd best. It makes you want to read the other two. It starts you on the adventures with Sally, you meet her enimies, her friends her allies. Once you read this book, you'll want to read the other two."
5,"""Murder and Mayhem"" (and Mystery too!)","A great mystery that will keep you turning the pages 'till you hit the back cover! The twisted plot might be hard to follow if the book is above your level, but otherwise a fantastic and exciting book that's a shame to miss!"
4,The most authentic of the crackerjack series,"Phillip Pullman is largely successful in this first homage to the sensation novels and gothics of the Victorian period in this gladly feminist novel for teenagers. All the elements you'd expect from Charlotte Bront, Wilkie Collins and Conan Doyle are there: a headstrong and independent young heroine, a cold and heartless guardian aunt, a mysterious jewel from India, East End skullduggery, and all manner of plots and counterplots. This is a good read, and Sally and her friends make for involving and even admirable characters. And thus I think the reviewer below who thinks this book inappropriate for teenagers is far off the mark ."
4,"For adults Dark Materials is better, but not bad.","This is very light reading for an adult. However good sort of mystery/action book for early teens or younger if mature readers. Its sort of a cross between Nancy Drew and Hardy boys with an English Public School boys perspective. Although some murder and scary stuff for kids a very quick read for serious readers. I much prefer his Dark Materials books, of course since they are more adult and the characters are more developed. But a good read for Pullman fans."
1,Rather Dull,"I won't deny it... Pullman is an extraodinary author. For proof, you need only look to Pullman's 'His Dark Materials' trilogy. But this trilogy was dull. Very dull. It is an excellent example of Victorian England, but if that's not what your looking for, save your money. Buy something else. Buy something good."
1,Dreadfully Boring,"Dreadfully boring. The ending was good, but the beginning is just awful. I only finished it because I was doing a book report on it. Just awful, especially compared to The Golden Compass. 1 Star, and only because I can't give 0."
2,Just thinking about it gives me the willies!,"This book has more inappropriate for anyone under 16 y o elements than I can count, yet it is marketed as a children's book! I think that this will be the last book I will read by Phillip Pullman. He has a gift for beautiful word choice and creating a creepy setting but uses these to peddle content that is waaaay too unsavory for children's literature. I don't believe that he understands what is healthy for children to read.Aside from that, the end was predictable and too many events crossed the line of believability. There is little to no character development.Ugh. (insert shudder here)"
5,A RIVITING BOOK WHICH I COULDN'T PUT DOWN,"THE BOOK ""RUBY IN THE SMOKE"" HAD ME READING DAY AND NIGHT. SALLY WAS A GIRL THAT I WISH TO BE LIKE, AND THE BOOK IS ONE THAT SHOULD BE READ. IT WILL CERTAINLY LIVE UP TO ALL EXPECTATIONS. MAYBE EVEN BEOYND."
3,Okay,"Good ending, very suspensful, but why read the beginning of a horribly boring book just for the ending"
2,We Were Not Impressed...,"The book didn't pull us in...the characters were shallow and superficial; there was no point to many of them. Jim? Who? What is happening with Sally and Fredrick? The only reason we kept reading was because we had to. None of us really liked the book...we ordered it because of the excellent reviews, and were disappointed by the reality. It had a good basis and general idea, but the book didn't go where it should have. There was a lot of potential, but no depth to the characters and nothing was really thought through. Many parts of the book could have gone more into depth, but Pullman just glossed over most of the important parts and interesting subjects and facts. For example, the photo shop. No one cares. But, the history of the ruby was an interesting topic that was not elaborated on, and the ruby itself was almost dropped out of the story. In conclusion, we were not all that thrilled with this novel."
2,"Had potential, but not that great","Okay, I know I'm going to injure the sensibilities of hardcore Pullman fans with this review, but this is the first book of his that I've read, so perhaps that can explain my opinion. Honestly, I didn't find the book that great. The Victorian setting and detailed background (what with the opium trade and photography shop)are quite original for a children's novel, but other than that, the novel didn't strike me as particularly impressive. The characters aren't strongly delineated and the plot moves a bit too quickly (though that's normally a good point). I felt the author should have spent more time with characterization, so that the surprise ending (yup, there's a surprise) has more impact on the reader."
5,Mystery in store,"It was great! I never wanted to put down the book. It was full of mystery and aventer. I think EVERYONE FROM AGES 10-50 would love this book.The book is about mystery,love,and adventure. EVERYONE should read RUBY IN THE SMOKE."
3,Not as Good as His Dark Materials,"It was pretty good. Maybe I'm just spoiled by reading Pullman's other (wonderful, amazing) trilogy first, but it was alright. Definitely nowhere near the His Dark Materials trilogy, but we'll read the other books before we judge the trilogy, eh? This is the story of Sally Lockhart, a very capable young woman in Victorian England. Her father dies and Sally finds herself wrapped up in a mystery she knows it's up to her to solve. Sally's a likeable character and she has likeable sidekick people like Frederick the photographer and Jim the errand boy guy. Eh, it was alright."
2,Not too great,"I was hoping to find that this would be as interesting as The Golden Compass. However, that was not the case. I found the book to be rather bleak and boring."
3,"Okay, can you say ""Repeated History""?","Pullman is an amazing author with extrodinary talents, but if you have read all of his books, you will see an on-going pattern: ""Blonde orphan suddenly stuck in a tough situation"". That pretty much sums up this book, though I enjoyed the mystery of the ruby greatly, perhaps Pullman needs to go fishing in an idea bucket."
4,"good, good, good, yet sometimes confusing and tiring","as i said in my title, it is very good, good, good, yet confusing and tiring in places. It is very creepy and cool. Full of opium dens, dark alleyways, rat infested houses, and evil people, and mysterious men with many secrets. A perfect mystery lovers book. I reccomend you read it, very entertaining."
3,only ok,"i read this book hoping for something similar to Pullman's later work, his dark materials. It isnt that. Its pretty dry, just a regular girl who happens to come into several bouts of both good and bad luck. Ill give it three stars because it kept my attention long enough to finish it, and I'll probably read the other two. hopefully they will be better."
4,A real mystery,"When Sally Lockheart's father mysterious dies she wants to know how. And when someone gives her a cryptic message in scribbly hand writing, she sees a phrase that will change her life as she knows it. Beware The Seven Blessings. And when she asks a man who worked for her father about it he drops dead. She's immeaditally thrown into a strange world where she's hunted like a dog. She's meets people that will affect her life like no other, a photographer, an opium smoker, a child who's never alowed to see daylight and a boy named Jim. All of them who who's lives are put in danger by the enemy.This was a great book for mystery fans. I'm definatly reading the next two!"
2,An OK Book,"This book was just OK. It started out great! ""BEWARE THE SEVEN BLESSINGS!"" That was awesome. However, as soon as you find out who the seven blessings are, the book goes downhill from there. I must admit that it's a well written book, but it only keeps you interested until you're three-quarters of the way through. I'd say it's worth reading once but not again."
3,"eh, it's okay","i started reading this book and didn't get very far. i wasn't as interested in it as i was in teh golden compass and that trilogy. i found that to be more engaging, so i was hoping this would be as well, but it's not."
5,That Bridge...,"This was the first book of Philip Pullman's that I read and I was hooked after. This is great and it's almost as if you are seeing what Sally is. Lovely book, it's wonderful. It's just the beginning of what is to come that makes it so interesting..."
4,A Real Page-Turner!,"The Ruby was very suspenseful, I couldn't put it down! But I have to say I was somewhat disapointed in the rest of the trilogy. There was one thing in The Ruby that was left unanswered, or maybe I just didn't pick it up, who was Sally's mother? Overall I certainly recommend this book! P.S. If you like The Ruby, definitely read The Golden Compass!"
3,It's about time but what were they thinking on that price?,"Finnally Sony is trying to catch up to the competition. But with a [price] price tag more then double their competitors of the same size hdtv set who are they kidding. And of course this model is not available anywhere. You can not even find it on sony's web site. So amazon knows about it but that just means they plan to sell it in the us. Who knows when, and at [price] I don't see them selling to many. Don't get me wrong I love sony products everything I own is sony, if this product was priced comparably with it's competition I'd be at the store right now picking it up. Looks like the competition is still got the upper hand on HDTV. I hope sony corrects this soon as it's almost foot ball season."
2,Just OK,I thought this book was more poetry than a novel. It just didn't draw me in and I feel it was hard to follow.
2,windy,"The author had enough material for a magazine article, but decided to stretch it out to a full length book. This required endless repetition and tedious exposition. I put it down part way through."
3,Yes - No syntax creates more than a semiotic rift,"I'm a fan of Ury's work, in particular his participation in the writing of Getting to Yes. However, I find this latest effort, using the words 'Yes' and 'No' to develop your negotiating and communication strengths to be awkward and dense. The work creates an awkward and - I feel - unrealistic context for the improvement of negotiating skills. It is, of course, true, that in many business cultures, it is difficult to say 'No.' The book may be of greater value as an instructional device for those coming from ascriptive cultures, where saying 'No' is unacceptable. However, I found statements such as 'Uncover your Yes' and 'Empower your No' disappointingly quippy and trite. I guess I've uncovered my No."
1,Why is being honest something to be ashamed about?,"I just didn't GET this book, nor did I enjoy reading it. It jumps around to different subjects and the good stuff could have been condensed into 5 pages, besides that other people wrote better books on ""NO"". Maybe I'm an undiagnosed autistic but since when is being honest with your fellow man something to be ashamed of and dance around. Is this world so full of entitled people that saying no now is politically incorrect?I picked it up in the library because the title sounded interesting. It wasn't."
2,Dissapointed,"I found this book is to over analytical of the simple word ""no""....the author tries to prove it's importance, however he does it in a dry, wordy, and uninteresting manner. I wish there were more examples in it, to save time from reading the whole thing. The basics point is a ""good"" no is actually:yesnoyes...now you know the no secret (haha), so save yourself some money and say NO to this book!"
1,boring,"the book is nonsense,state your yes and other odd stuff, state your yes?getting pas no was great, i suggest reading that"
3,Some good thoughts.,"The concept of this book is good but a bit thin especially if you are already familiar with ""Getting to Yes"" which has a lot more substance. However, still good advice for people who are faced with the situation of needing to say no and maintain a working relationship with the other party."
1,A Day Late and a Dollar Short,"This book is the outcome of what happened when master negotiator Jim Camp (author of ""Start with No!"") was invited to a symposium on negotiating at Harvard, and proceeded to blow William Ury & company out of the water. Camp is the real deal and has the data to back it up. The Harvard guys hated Camp and had to regroup to save their academic behinds. If you want the real deal, read ""Start with No!"", and find out how 'Getting to Yes' and other boooks of that ilk simply reduce you to cannon fodder in the face of an experienced and ruthless negotiator."
5,Skull-Duggery...,"If you are a Peter Cushing / Christopher Lee (Horror Express, The Creeping Flesh, Horror Of Dracula, etc.) fanatic, then THE SKULL is a must for your collection! This time, Cushing gets to play the obsessed, murderous character, while Lee is the voice of sanity. Both are tremendous as always, delivering effortless performances. The story (by none other than Robert Bloch) is an eerie gem w/ plenty of supernatural darkness and death. The title SKULL has a sinister personality of its own, as we are given its point of view through skull-o-vision! Classic stuff! Also, watch for Michael Gough (Horror Hospital, Batman, Batman Returns, Sleepy Hollow) as an auctioneer, and Patrick Magee (Asylum, Dementia 13, A Clockwork Orange) in a 10-second role as a police investigator at the end. This Amicus production, directed by Freddie Francis, belongs in any horror vault..."
4,Nice gothic style movie from Amicus,"First of all, I am glad this Amicus classic is out on DVD. The actual release offers a very good widescreen, analog to digital transfer with the trailer as the only extra here. English subtitles are provided only. The movie clearly fits into the early 1960s' more gothic style of British horror. I am giving four stars to this film because the character played by Christopher Lee (sadly) does not do much on the script, and the ending is flat and a bit out of imagination. That said, I would never miss getting a copy of this atmospheric film, with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing together once more. Hopefully two more Freddie Francis (director) titles will be produced on DVD soon, including ""Tales that witness madness"", and ""Legend of the werewolf""."
2,flaw with the DVD case,"I have just received my DVD of The Skull and had to send it back. The DVD case had something which looked like Chimpanzee hair all over it.At first I thought they packaged a Skull promo wig in the DVD box, but my DVD had so much hair on it I couldn't play it.I'd be curious to know if anyone else had this problem."
4,The Skull is Swell!,"I watched this movie first on ""The Uncanny Film Festival and Camp Meeting"" with Dr. Mazeppa Pompazoidi in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1971.Have you ever fallen asleep with a horror movie going on the TV? You half-hear some of the dialog and wake up occasionally to check out what is going on. Being half-asleep, your defenses are not up to par. There is a free-floating feeling of foreboding.This happened to me with ""The Skull"". Once when I woke up, this skull was apparently levitating and moving toward the professor. Under these circumstances, it was pretty scary!Like most Hammer productions, this one is well mounted and written. I have seen it again since 1971. I like the slower pacing movies of this period have---it lets the story build.If this sounds like your kind of movie, check it out!"
4,A very good 70's British Horror flick,"Peter Cushing is at his clinically clean best as an ambitious and ""do anything"" collector of Historical Horror artifacts.He finally lands on a horror collectors dream... the Skull of the ""Marqui De Sade""The Skull has a life force that kills at will and floats around in the midst a green fog like cloud. Once Cushings character obtains the skull all kinds of nasty horror stuff starts happening. The dream sequence is very well done. Chistopher Lee stars as the previous owner of the ""Skull"" who advises Peter Cushing to get rid of it at any cost.An Amicus production. It's a very good 70's Britsh Horror Flick.Excellent Remastering."
4,Very good Amicus picture,"""The Skull"" was, until this lovely DVD release, one of the rarely seen Amicus horror classics. Very creepy with a good atmosphere for horror and Peter Cushing & Christopher Lee made it what it is, a horror classic different to many others. Patrick Wymark was well suited in his role in this film too. In 2.35:1 widescreen and a nice transfer, another great offering from Legend Films, a top name for rare films coming to DVD!"
5,Grew up on this *book*,"I own this book. Bought it in 1973 when I was a 15 year old dome fanatic.If you want to build yerself a dome from scratch, get this book.It's worth the cost, despite the ""collector's mark-up"".Lot's of good, hard data."
3,A dark counterpoint to Heinlein,"Right away, we meet an athletic protagonist. And intellectual, too. In an eerie repeat of the Manhattan project, he and collaborators create FTL drives, battle moles inside their organization, and fight a radically different war. It costs the U.S. millions of lives but opens up a new era of space exploration.Why do I feel unsettled? For one thing, no one in the Defense Dept tries to usurp command. Politicians express their gratitude (?!?). But mostly, it pits one nation against U.S. as if this were a winner-take-all poker game. It isn't, because the victors will need a follow-on book to heal and create a strategic vision for Earth's battered survivors."
5,Good First Novel,"I seldom buy first books by new authors in hardback, but elected to do so in this case based upon the sample chapters I'd read at Baen's webpage. It hooked me enough on the story I was willing to spend the money NOW to buy the hardback, rather than waiting a year for the paperback edition. In my opinion, it was worth the money. Imagine - an SF book with Science in it. (Remember, guys? used to be that's what the S in SF was for.) Note to others - if you're not sure about this, go read the sample chapters at baen.com first, then buy if you like it."
4,Keep it coming!,"A fun book to read. Lots of action, suspense and a few unexpected twists. Having read several of Dr. Taylor's professional publications I was not surprised to see plots, gadgets and things yet to be that are based on real physics. Makes the book a lot more fascinating to me. This kind of science fiction can lead to science future. I look forward to more of his science fiction with the expectation that he just might make it a reality."
5,Great read,"I have read this book several times, and it has been very enjoyable each time. It is a book the I would highly recommend getting along with the sequel ""quantum connection""."
2,Profoundly Disappointing,"This book is, at best, an intro to ADHD.I bought it hoping that there would be some specific ""how to study"" tips for highschool and college students with AD/HD, but there is nothing of the sort. In fact, there is very little in this book that isn't found in other books written for children or adults. The chapter, ""Legal rights of students with ADD"" is useful and relevant, but that is 10 pages out of a 150.There are two other annoying things about this book. First, Quinn uses the term 'ADD', which has been scientifically obsolete since the 1980s. Second, Quinn's writing style is somewhat condescending.I would recommend that a person new to their diagnosis, or even somebody who is old hand, read ""You Mean I'm not Lazy, Stupid, or Crazy?"" as opposed to this book."
2,Read more like a pamphlet than a book...,"which, given its target audience, could be a good thing?Either way, I got *very* little new information out of this book... and I'm no expert... I've only spent a few hours looking ADD up online.If you need something to tell a student with ADD what ADD is like (as if they wouldn't know), and offer some overly obvious solutions... this is your book... or pamphlet."
4,I enjoyed it,"A friend of mine introduced me to this game when I was in 6th grade & I fell in love with it. It was fun & enjoyable. It has a interesting plot with a few anime clips, which makes the game even more enjoyable. The playthrough is smooth & crisp, which was great quality at the time it was created. Also, I thought Alicia, Stare, & Flare were cute. Plus the 3D graphics were pretty amazing for a 64-bit processor console.On the downside, I wish the game had lasted longer. I was able to beat half of the game in less than 3 hrs. It's a really easy game to beat if you are a hardcore gamer. I give it a 4 out of 5 because it's really short. If the game had been longer, I would have given it a 5 out of 5.Overall, I enjoyed this game. And I'm glad I still have it. It's probably rare now. Still I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of platform, anime, & platform games.Tail Concerto is a short, unique platform game that you will enjoy"
5,Glad that this is still in print!,"I was so pleased when I saw ""The Answer"" still in print. This was the Bible translation I used when I was dealing with breast cancer over a decade ago. It helped me immensely and the translation is comforting and clear, but accurate. I also found the devotions from different spiritual leaders to be helpful in my walk with God. I gave this translation to my daughter and praying that it touches her life and reminds her of what she learned as a child in our home."
2,Hmmmm,"The selection is not precisely marvelous. It makes no sense to present a fragmentation through several volumes of 'Mexican music', instead of offering a serious portrait of different composers. Enrique Bátiz is not the best conductor for a program of Mexican music, and it becomes dramatically clear through the superficial versions of Revueltas' music. In addition to it, the program notes by John W. Duarte are childish, and contain serious mistakes (specially chronological)."
4,Some day this all might become true!,I've been reading a lot of books about the moon and it's exploration lately. Some deal with the Apollo past but also some about the (near) future. This book gives a good overview of the aspects involved in developing a permanent base on the moon. It even deals with long term development of cities containing thousands of people. The concepts presented are viable although it presents some concepts that are to far into the future to my likings. It not only presents the theorectical concepts but also the work that has been done in relevant research areas and the problems encountered. It is not science fiction. Not only does the book cover the technical challenges but it also deals with economical and political aspects of a lunar base. If you want to get a clear picture of the current state of the art of lunar development this book is a very good starting point.
5,gold,"This group a breath of fresh air to the usual country music which is too much the same. They are like a surprise package,not afraid to play just about any music category; rock,western,pop,softetc. & they combine these elements into some exciting music..wow!"
1,Lacks energy and rhythm,"I bought this CD mostly because I wanted a good recording of the first Piano Sonata. I was disappointed. Portugheis seems to have misunderstood what Ginastera's music is all about-rhythmic vitality. In most of Ginastera's music, rhythmic drive is of primary importance and pitch (though still important) is secondary. Portugheis romanticizes the heck out of it. Often, the rhythms he plays are the result of technical (as opposed to musical) rubato, i.e. he doesn't have the technical command to play the damn thing. He stumbles through almost the entire piece. He turns 5/8 measures in 6/8's. A strict tempo rarely exists for long. When the rhythmic vitality is lost, the energy of the piece goes down the drain. If you want to hear a guy play Ginastera well, Santiago Rodriguez is your man. His level of energy will blow you away."
2,I agree with the other reviewers!,"I bought this album along with volume 2, and I have to agree with the other reviewers that it is a pretty disappointing album. I became interested in Ginastera's piano music when I heard GREAT recordings of the piano sonata no. 1 and the argentine dances. Not being a pianist myself, I still manage to notice the defectiveness in the music, mainly that it lacks the rhythmic vitality and speed that I believe the music requires to be exciting. However, I do think some of the recordings are not bad, such as the pequena danza and the american preludes. Overall, however, this isn't a great disc to buy of Ginastera. That is not to say that Portugheis is a bad pianist, I'm sure he does great with other music, just not this!"
1,Yawn,"This Cd put me right to sleep. The pianst plays this weird rythym where he speeds up in some places and slows down in others irratically. The pianst for this album must have had trouble reading the music, because there aren't supposed to be any rests in random places. This is a fast dancing piece, hence the title: Danzas Argentinas! If you want a vison for this album, imagine a sprinter running the 400 meter dash. Suddenly the sprinter stops and walks a few paces. And then he speeds back up again, only to stop to tie his shoe. And so on. I would highly recommend another CD. Dude, Martha Argerich has an interpertation that will knock your socks off. Wahhhh!"
2,"fun content, worst mixing i've ever heard","I watched this documentary on Netflix. It follows the course of enthusiasm around this style of recreation and why it's important to those involved. The audio levels are so outrageously out of balance i spent as much time adjusting the volume as i did watching the action. You will be heavily distracted by how the doc instantly changes from a mumbling interview to loud music, and that the levels required to hear a lot of the interviewees themselves are imbalanced amongst themselves, which feels like a set up for a noise complaint. One second after the interviewee stops talking, you will need to immediately turn the volume down, a jagged up and down routine that may remind the viewer of biking through most cities and towns on the planet. Credited for this bipolar cycling nightmare is the mixer/sound editor Jon Greasley. I hope his prospective future clientele will take a few minutes to hear his portfolio to better understand what i'm writing about."
2,Lacks interest and excitement,"As avid cyclist, track racer, and former bike messenger myself, I normally get excited about bike films. The cinematography is very good. But this one seems to drag on in slow motion. It's an essay style film with no story line. It's very San Francisco-centric, which is annoying unless you're from San Franciscans, who seem to think that they live in the center of the universe. And the subjects don't seem to be doing anything interesting except riding their bike around. The original MASH SF film is much more exciting and thrilling to watch if you're into fixed gear riding."
2,"incorrect description, but ok product","This has no ""Rain Sensor"", described in the description and no input for one. Just like every other timer you can add a external stand alone sensor from rainbird. Without a simple rain delay functionality, and a more difficult interface I would recommend the Orbit timers, unless you need the Fuse-less surge protection feature. Their rain features are much more intuitive."
3,Stevie Ray-Great Player!,"Greg Koch? If he were half as funny as he thinks he is, he wouldn't have to do these videos! Seriously, Greg is a talented player, but less so a teacher. He spends too much time on his show-off shtick almost to the point of hostility, and provides too little detail in the lessons. Check out Andy Aledort for a helpful teaching experience that's about the music. Take notes, Greg!"
5,Easy SRV licks,"Is very easy to play. The video is a DVD and is at great resolutions too. Usually it is not. Great dvd, very cool."
3,Good video; frustrating without tabs to follow.,"This DVD is well-made and nice to watch, and Greg plays the SRV style excellently. This video was somewhat frustrating because (1)you have to rewind so much; (2) there are no accompanying tabs; and (3) there are not a lot of examples performed in slo-mo which are slow enough to learn licks without tabs.If you find some good tabs on the internet, learning the licks on this video is a more reasonable feat."
4,Excellent Guitar Instruction,"Suitable for intermediate learners and beyond.Greg slows it down just enough when he's teaching. The video captures 2 angles using PIP - fingering and picking. Once you've mastered a part you can practice at speed with Greg and his band. There are enough well placed video markers that allow a user to jump right to the instructional parts. Really excellent instructional content from the easy going and enthusiastic Greg Koch, who is truly a phenomenal guitarist in his own right."
1,Change the title to Koch's instructions of Stevie Ray Vaughan Music,"Stevie Ray Vaughan is NOT even in this DVDI thought I would at least see some of Stevie Ray's songs. I don't care if Koch can copy some of his songs, there is not way on earth he has the same sound as Stevie.Stevie Ray Vaughan may be the best guitarist that ever lived on earth! His thunderous~rifts would rock the stage like no other. Obviously Jimmy Page & Hendricks and a handful of others have their 1st place position."
4,Grab your guitar!,"Greg Koch is an entertaining, almost cartoonish, guitar clinician who delivers a good overview of Stevie Ray Vaughn's recorded songs. This doesn't break down every little aspect of every song, but it does offer a comprehensive look at most of the signature parts."
3,Good to learn the technique,"I bought the DVD after the good reviews I read. This is an excellent DVD to learn the technique and sound of SRV. I like the way in which Koch approaches each song and goes over the main riffs explaining how to develop the right technique. Some reviews complaint about his silly sense of humor. Regardless of whether you like his humor or not, he delivers. Then he plays the songs in context. I think this is where the DVD falls short. The performances are just performances, which are fun to watch, but not very pedagogical. It would have been more effective to have on-screen tabs, that way you can get the technique explanations of the main riffs, and you can look at the note for note transcription when he plays the songs. There is another DVD that achieves that goal, by Doug Bouch. Although I like Koch's technique approach better. So, it is a very good DVD, but if you are looking for a note-for-note explanation of everything, this DVD is not for you."
3,"Good, but not great Pokemon clone","For those of you who have played Pokemon, and can't get enough of collecting monsters, this may be the game for you. The story is that you try to convince monsters to join your party and then run around fighting various baddies. Not as cute or appealing as Pokemon, but an interesting way to pass the time on the subway.The game is neither really good nor really bad, but if you, like me, can't get a copy of Pokemon Yellow then you might want to give this one a try."
4,"As Siskel and Ebert would put it, ""I give it two thumbs up!""","This RPG is one of the best I have played. It is second only to Pokemon. So if you are into RPG's and you have played and/or own Pokemon, try Revelations: The Demon Slayer. Even if you don't like RPG's you have to at least try this game."
1,Love Profusion...Success Delusion,"Is this the 4th or 5th single from American Life? I have lost track now, since none of them have gone ANYWHERE. Yet, that doesn't stop Madonna and her never-ending ego from continuing to release them--even though AL was a dismal commercial failure. Madonna just cannot accept that this project failed so miserably. Is she hoping that by releasing single after single after single, that ONE of them is going to become a flash hit? Sorry, Madonna, but AL was a horrible project. The sooner you come to grips with that fact and move on with your next project, the more quickly you can sweep it under the rug. By continuing to release single after single, you are only prolonging the agony and emphasizing just how bad AL really is."
1,Madonna in CRISIS!!!! Another Try and Another Fail!!!!,Love Profusion SUCKS!!!!! First because sounds the same as all Madonna singles and she MOANS more than sings. Another REMIX that after few weeks will go into the trash can. Love Profusion SUCKS because Madonna shows all her IMMATURITY as singer!!!! At 46 still sings like a teen girl. I waisted my money!!!! I will donate this CD to the salvation army.
5,The Passengerz Remix,"All the tracks on this CD Single are excellent, especially the rmx. The tracklisting is below plus some comments:01 Love Profusion : Album Version (3.36) - Good track to be released as a single.02 Nothing Fails : Radio Edit (3.46) - Basically the album ver. without the choir. Still an excellent track, though.03 Love Profusion : The Passengerz Remix (7.01) - The main reason to buy this single. It's red hot and nearly on fire!! Much better than the remix on CD2.Good CD, but if you want more remixes of Love Profusion get the maxi. It includes 3 Ralph Rosario mixes (none on CD 2) plus an extended Passengerz Remix (not this one). However, to have all the remixes of Love Profusion you need a total of 3 CDs.(All Love Profusion Singles).1. UK CD 1 (This one).2. UK CD 2.3. Maxi.Thanx."
5,She's A Love Profusion ..,"This beautiful ballad has easily become everyone's favorite album track. It is the fourth single to be released of the amazing album 'American Life'. 'Nothing Fails' is an affecting love song to her husband. Attesting to the transformative power of love, Madonna's sincerity is apparent more so than on any other song. Madonna takes on the role of Joni Mitchell as she uses her folk songwriting techniques with an electro twist on 'Love Profusion'. 'Love Profusion' starts out light and unadorned, until beats build around the guitar she's playing. This time the track is an ode to children as well as Guy Richie."
5,Essential for Self Knowledge,"For PTSD trauma, War Veterans, Abuse survivors & Mental Health professionals, this small, inexpensive book from Amazon.com is a Jewel! After thirty-four years of extreme abuse and 22 years of recovery programs, these 59 Points of Mind Training provide the most effective, practical tools I've ever encountered for cutting through any ego construct, neurosis or low self-esteem issue. I found it a delightful mix of belly-laugh humor and incredible Discipline. and If I can learn to be totally responsible for & truly LOVE myself . . . to Know myself & have compassion for all, then Anyone can!"
2,not particularly inspiring or approachable,this is a bit more how to than it is inspirational. not much that I want to get out of it.
1,Poor interpretation,"I purchased this CD because I was working on the Suite de Danzas Criollas. Unfortunately, the playing here lacks any kind of energy, especially rhythmic vitality. Also, the movements are marked ""attacca,"" but there are HUGE gaps between tracks."
2,Negative Metamorphosis,"Burgess's ""Smack,"" written a year before his short novel ""Junk,"" is a terrific novel that captivies and evokes emotion. ""Junk,"" however, is a poorly written screen-play version of that novel. The point of creating such a thing is beyond me. He should have stopped while he was ahead with ""Smack."""
2,trainspotting jr,"When I first read junk i thought that it was a good if not great look at children and heroin. Then I read trainspotting and noticed that not only had Melvin Burgess stolen his idea of heroin addiction off of the scottish author but he had also stolen the disconnected writing style used by Welsh. If you want a kids read, read junk, if however you want an adult look at addiction read an original book like Junky or Trainspotting. Junk is a n enjoyable read but the characters are too tame to provoke a true emotional response."
5,A Dangerous World Put Forward,"Junk is an outstanding book that explores the world of drugs and throws you into the typical life of a 'junkie'. It is a powerful book that has you gripped from the start, like any good book that you simply cannot put down.It has a great layout that puts you into the junkies' minds', looking out on their world, clearly giving you the ups and downs of junk. It shows just how dangerous a world full of junk can be.This is a book that well deserves the 5 star treatment."
5,Choices,"This story tells the truth about addiction. It opens the readers eyes to our choices. We all have them. Great eye opening story. Grasp yourself for reading the TRUTH! Choices and how they affect one can also be read about in the book Not all prisons have bars"" by Renne Bonds & C.J.Not All Prisons Have Bars"
5,You HAVE to read this book!!,"Junk is one of the best books I've ever read.. well, actually it's THE best book I've ever read. I started off disliking Melvin Burgess's style of writing, but now I see it as it is, nothing but genious. The way each chapter is written from another character's point of view is amazing, and the characters are painted fantastically. I found myself laughing out loud, or standing up and screaming at the inanimate book when things went wrong! I completely fell in love with Tar, and I felt as if Gemma was sitting next to me and reading these words to me... plus I have a new found love of dandelions!! If you don't have time to read this book, get time, because it may do to you what it did to me.. it gave me an entirely different outlook on life.. I wouldn't say it put me off drugs at all, but it certainly was honest, rather than just telling me ""All drugs are bad. Never do drugs."" If you have any interest in anything at all, then read this book!! JUNK ROX!!"
5,Very Romantic Ella,"Since UMG united Decca and Polygram, the issues of Ella's catalog have been an interesting mix of her Decca and Polygram recordings, something thought not possible a few years ago. This cd is not the first to put these two studio recordings together, however it's the first to present songs with a singular theme. Intimacy is the name of the game, this is a collection of the most intimate songs Ella's recorded. There are no strings here, this music is Ella with trio only, culled from all her albums including the songbooks. The mastering of this disc is excellent; Ella had a tendency to sing really close to the mike and it seems the producer of this disc chose only those songs with Ella up front. The Decca sides are presented here with the best sound to date; the songs are not too sanitized with noise reduction, so listening fatigue is avoided. Overall this is a great summary of her most emotional readings, something not usually associated with her."
2,Not Fond of This Compilation,"Be advised that there are a lot of Ella's mono DECCA recordings included here and I did not expect that. Six selections alone are from the Decca Lp/Cd entitled ""Pure Ella"". Tha Cd is great, but it is not in stereo and the sound is off -- Ella's voice is recorded strangely and sounds much lower than it really was. These recordings simply do not fit in well with the others chosen. There are much better Fitzgerald compilations to chose, such as ""The Jazz Sides"" and the 3 cd ""First lady of Song"", both on Verve."
4,Starkville is a page turner!,"Reading this book was like a rollercoaster ride for me--exciting and full of twists and turns. I cared deeply for the characters. I wanted no harm to come to them. However, harm did come, and I cried. I didn't want this one to end!"
4,A fine pocket-sized Carpenter reference...and it's fun,"There is precious little out there between two covers about John Carpenter. This edition (from the pocket essentials series) is a concise and enthusiastic overall reference for the Carpenter fan or the would-be fan. My one caveat would be that perhaps the authors are a little blind when it comes to some of the movies where Carpenter had less than absolute control (the big studio productions). It really isn't enough to say that Memoirs of an Invisible Man was better than most Hollywood fare (because it wasn't), or to forgive Prince of Darkness by calling it a noble attempt at cerebral horror (because it isn't). But these are informed opinions and they provide food for thought. And that is really the best thing about this book -- it's smart and enthusiastic and it talks about my favorite director. And it made me think."
5,THIS BOOK SHOULD BE PUT TO MUSIC,"For parents looking for books written for children about death,I recommend this beautifully composed story. Children are exposed to death in a variety of ways and this is a book that can help waylay their fears, allow them to feel with the young boy and experience his healing. Howard Kaplan's words put the reader into the story with his lyrical prose and images. As a woman who faced the loss of her mother at a young age, I felt like Howard had captured the emptiness and the lost feelings I had at the time. Howard,as your sister who sat at that piano and played ""Fur Elise"" over and over again with that G Clef lamp over my head, I congratulate you on your ability to combine poetry and prose and create a beautiful book."
5,Challenging!,"Hacker's Challenge is a must have for every computer forensics. The scenarious given are indeed technically challenging and I like the fact that the complexity of attack, prevention, and mitigation are already specified. It is also very helpful as it make references to external resources that contain more info about a particular specified vulnerabilities. The log files, network maps, etch are very helpful in making a forensic analysis. I look forward to getting the new version.Cold Eyes"
4,"Good, but scenarios getting out of date","The Challenge/Solution style of these books are great for security beginners as well as seasoned professionals. If you read carefully you can pick up many hints/tools which you can use in real life security scenarios.My only -ve comment about this book is its getting out of date now. Many of the incidents described are not relevant now, as security practices at most firms would thrawt these incidents. Having said that, the scenarios are still good for security beginners. For advanced readers I would suggest the Second edition or the soon to be released third edition."
2,Hacker's Challenge,Complicated. Misleading. Not at all what I expected! Over-priced and very rudimentary. Not worth the hard earned dollars that I shelled out for the book.
5,A true genius,Mike Schiffman has always amazed me with his intelligence and cunning. His experience in this field shines through as he delivers real world examples in a entertaining and informative format. Highly recommended.
1,EXTREMELY disappointed!,"We ordered one dozen of the Platinum candles from Smart Candle 2-3 years ago, including a charging station. Cost a fortune. Use them for our wedding. Lost the plug for the charging station in a move and spent over $50 for a replacement cord from Smart Candle directly. Recently attempted to recharge the candles only to find that 5 of the 12 would not hold their charge. Almost 1/2 of them! After several weeks of a run-around, and being shuffled off to deal with one of their distributors in the area, was told that they don't stand behind their product. Can you believe?! After spending $350 for the system, which included candles that couldn't cost more than a few dollars, we're now instructed to just buy more.Would strongly encourage anyone to rethink this decision.We stepped up for the excessive cost with the mindset that we would have them for a long time. 42% failure rate in just 2-3 years has made this look like a terrible decision.Buyer beware!"
4,"Nifty to build, bit pricy","One of the best values of LEGO Technics is the education value. The forklift accomplishes this well, as it teaches several mechanical principles (rear steering, graduated lift, universals, tilt back, and smooth lift mech.) It's a bit hard to put the fork section together, but the body part is not difficult. I thought it a bit pricy, even given the nice mechanics. Fairly decent parts selection, similar to my favorite this year - the excavator at 20.00."
2,"Initially promising, but...","The NEC FP950 is at best an average monitor. The color, contrast, sharpness is pretty good for most items -- i.e. pictures, webpages, video. The problem lies in the sharpness of letters. If you run at either 640x480 or 800x600 resolution, curved letters are blurred. For example, the ""b"" in blurred is grossly blurred around the curves of the letter. It is very apparent at larger font sizes -- 14 and up. The tech. rep from amazon.com called NEC to explain the problem. NEC's solution was to run at a higher resolution. That solution worked to remove the blur, but I don't consider that a solution given that I want to run the resolution at 800x600. That's comparable to me buying a Ford and reverse doesn't work. I call Ford and they tell me to always park such that I can always pull forward. NEC should advertise that the monitor is only capable of higher resolutions.Very poor customer/technical support."
2,Not so great as you'd think,"I thought this would be the end-all, be-all solution to my microcassette needs, which include field recordings, music ideas, dictation and lecture. It's not...I tried three models, thinking each time it was just a bad model, but each one had an enourmous amount of flutter on playback, as if everything recorded was being twanged with a whammy bar. Too large and bulky for standard dictation needs as well, you can do better for dication with a smaller one."
1,I agree with T. Jones...,"I have had 2 Rival crock pots and there is a design flaw. I found out what it is that lets liquid spit and sputter from the steam and make a puddle on your counter...the lip on the top of the crock is almost level with the lid.Now I purchased a Proctor Silex crock pot and I can see the difference. The PS has a higher ridge around the edge that holds the lid. That prevents condensation and steam from spitting out over the edge. So with the Rivals there is a design flaw - a silly little millimeter (ok, maybe a few) makes all the difference. I even switched lids between the 2 brands and that is it! I am sticking with my new one now as it works great and no mess. (Proctor-Silex 4 Qt Slow Cooker- sold here.)"
1,Too hot! We are throwing ours out!,"We bought this model at Target half a year ago. We bought it because we have had great luck with our previous Rival crockpot from the 1980s. Sadly, Rival crockpots are no longer what they are ""crocked up to be.""The main problem, which is apparently endemic across the Rival product line, is that low and high cook at the same temperature. Liquids boil vigorously on low, and it has sucked the life out of every roast we have prepared in it. Time to toss it out and switch to Cuisinart!Be sure to check out the review by Paul Frederick on the model 38501-W (ASIN: B00008I8NS). Paul is an engineer who ran some tests to prove there is no difference between low and high--the two settings both burn at the same wattage and raise the temperature of water at the same rate. There are complaints about too-hot ""slow"" cooking in the reviews of most Rival models, so beware."
2,LACKS the main appeal of having a crock*pot and dangerous!,"Bought this crockpot from a local dept. store hoping to enjoy it's nice size and color and the good crockpot name. Nope... As another reviewer stated, the lid is poorly designed. Moisture boils and sprays around the outside of the lid and causes the lid to bounce around. Drives me and my dog crazy. No way would I feel safe throwing something in it and going away for even a few hours much less a whole day. In this day and age it seems cheap products and profits are more important than long lasting quality and craftsmanship. Shame shame on CrockPot!"
2,Cooks Too High!,"This crock pot only works if you promise yourself to never use the ""high"" setting or you will end up with a charred meal! Use the low setting for recipes that call for a high setting and you should be okay. However, if you are looking for a true ""slow"" cooker then don't buy this one!"
2,Cooks too hot and fast,"Like many other have said, this crock pot just runs too hot, even on low. Everything ends up burned, dried out or tough... or its done literally hours before it should have been. Pass on this if you actually want anything to cook slowly."
2,Was great but CRACKED!,"I have had this product for 2 years and recently started using it after my 2nd son was born. It was just so much easier to prepare dinner with 2 babies! It always cooked well... loved it... no complaints, until now! My husband was washing it yesterday and noticed a hairline crack in the removable bowl... you can see it from inside and on the bottom! I don't know what I'm going to do! I certainly son't want to buy another ceramic one if it's going to crack... but I love the way it cooks!"
4,Got what we expected,"wAS LOOKING FOR A SMALLER SIE CROC-POT FOR 2 PEOPLE. tHIS FITS THE BILL PERFECTLY.HOW HARD CAN IT BE, PLUG IT IN,FILL IT UP AND TURN IT ON. dOES'NT SEEM TOO HOT AND COOKING TIME IS ACURATE."
4,Great little crock pot,"This crock pot is basic (high, low and warm temp settings, no automatic timer, no cover lock) but it is perfect for me. I only need a simple one. The feature it does have that I was looking for was the removeable washable crock. It is so easy to clean and to store what I cooked in the fridge. Someone was complaining in one of the reviews about how the vegies didn't cook and another that the pot cracked. I think had they taken the time to read the directions (which are not that lengthy), they could have avoided these problems. I had read some review of other crockpots about how they transferred a rubber or plastic smell to the food. This one does not do that. I am very happy with this purchase."
1,Takes up space,"This thing cant be used on 220V, yet when I searched for it I typed in 220V Crockpot and this was the first to appear. Sucha lie"
1,lid didn't fit,opened the box and the lid barely fit on the crock-pot. it almost looked like a completely different shape than the stoneware pot. imagine that the gaps caused by this ill-fitting lid would have left me with dried out food...returned immediately for the hamilton beach one (has gasket around lid and clips to ensure the lid seals).
3,Too Hot to Handle,"I received this crock pot as a gift Christmas 2008. I did not use it until a year later.Within the first hour after turning it on ""low,"" the outside of the crock pot got very hot, so hot that I could not keep my hand on it for more than a second. In my last review I said I was going to throw it out, but I've continued to use it because I've been too lazy to buy another one. I am still nervous about leaving it on while I go to work, but when I'm home it gets a lot of use. The liquid does lightly bubble when the setting is on low. Also, the liquid seeps between the pot and the aluminum sheath, which means encrusted stains to scrub around the nuts and bolts inside the base. Messy, but the food that comes out of it has always been good, so I'm upping my rating on this product. It does it's job."
1,Unfortunate,This product has burnt/dried out all of the food I've put in there. I cooked it the same way as my last one - but this one cooks it too fast. I am goin gto try the lowest setting next time - but it said in the manual that warm isn't for cooking - but I don't know what else to do. I might take it back if that doesn't work.The oval shape is nicer than the tall pot for throwing in frozen things.
2,Don't buy this cooker,My experience is the same as the other two reviewer. This crockpot has a design flaw that the condensation leaks out. I will not leave anything cooking in this crockpot while I am away. Too dangerous!
1,NEITHER ONE LASTED,"First one cracked and leaked into metal base less than one year after purchase. Rival acted like it was an act of congress to replace it and let's see; they are a multi-million dollar company and this was a $35.00 Crock Pot. hmmmmm! They agreed to send me a second one but would not honor a warranty with it. It arrived Oct. 2008. Last week it too cracked and leaked into metal base area. I called Rival, they said ""Sorry, and they cannot do anything about this and would I like to order (and pay for) a new one?"" I said No , Thank You, I'll order a Kitchen-Aid."
2,Handle on lids break off,"I have gone through several of this brand of slow cookers. They do a great job, but on every one of them (I've had 3) the handle on the lid breaks off. No matter how good the price is, its just not worth buying yet another crock pot that I will have to McGyver the lid. My cousin's did the exact same thing. I am going to try another brand."
5,Great and inexpensive,I love this crock pot. Its a great color so it looks good when you leave it on the kitchen counter. It does not take up too much space but you can easily make tons of food in it. Cleans easily and easy to use. Check out my Easy Crock Pot BBQ Barbecue Pulled Chicken Recipe: [...]
4,I love everything about this crockpot,"My son dropped and broke the lid of my previous crockpot, so I bought this one to replace it. This crockpot is perfect for my use. I just wish it came with a real cookbook."
4,"Nice worry-free appliance for Busy Moms, chronically ill, cold days","I purchased this product offline and have been very pleased with it. Slow cookers are essential for people with health problems, busy moms and folks who cook multiple meals at the same time.This Crock-pot is basic, and cooks a meal for four people, or lots of leftovers for one. It has a nice warming feature, which is good for keeping the food hot until everyone is finally ready to eat, or for those who straggle in one-by-one. It cools quickly when turned off, allowing for faster storage and clean up. It cleans easily and does not take much room on your kitchen counter.I prefer the dial-knob design, because digital cookers may break, rendering the entire appliance inoperable. For the price, I enjoy it very, very much."
3,"Works great, but cooks hot","This crockpot works like a charm. Lid fits well, and the heat is even and reliable. But it is TOO HOT. If a recipe says cook on low for six hours, it will take more like three. I make a point of starting everything from frozen--either I put in frozen meat and unfrozen sauce, or I mix everything together, freeze it solid, and then plop it in the crockpot. I've heard they turned up the heat on slow cookers for food safety reasons, but sheesh---cook it on low and then let me turn it on high for 15 minutes to avoid food safety issues!"
2,Lid doesn't fit:sputters liquid all over,"Have had this crockpot for a couple of years, but tired of having to seal the edges around the lid with aluminum foil to avoid the mess.Looking for a new crockpot with a gasket or locking lid."
2,"Cheap, shoddy plastic on lids","I've had this Crockpot about two or three years. I've used it about 6-8 times per year. And the plastic handle on the lid cracked in two and fell off.I was about to accept this as a weird fluke, until the plastic handle on the lid of my larger Crockpot did the exact same thing a few months later. I'd had it longer, but used it less. WTF?I can't find replacement lids for both models on their site. They have no online support. So what am I to do with two Crockpots with lids that are useless? My last Crockpot, previous to these two, threw sparks and shorted out a mere year after purchase. I'm done with Rival."
5,Fantastic Crock Pot,"This crock pot is the perfect size to throw in a chicken and lot of veggies. Just love it. Does a fabulous job and is so, so easy to clean with its glass lid and easy care pottery pot. Has a low, high and a warm setting, which comes in handy. Just love it and would highly recommend it."
1,Too hot! Meats were tough and inedible.,"I wrote to Rival to tell them that my stews were not coming out right even though I've been following tried and tested recipes to thr T. My stews were boiling on low and the meats always came out tough and inedible. In their reply, they said that the warm setting was set to 160-180F, and that the low and high settings were both at 215F, but come on and off at different intervals, hence the distinction between low and high. Anyway, they think my crockpot is faulty and are sending me a new one, hope this new one works, or maybe we should cook on the 'warm' setting."
2,"Cooks Way Too Hot, As Others Say","This is my first crock pot. I've enjoyed the meals I've made in them, but a few have been very overcooked. There's no way I could leave the crock pot alone for an entire day while I'm at work--kind of defeats the purpose. I'm either going to have to get a new pot or resign myself to only using it when I'll be out for a few hours. My sister and mother were inspired to buy one at my recommendation and they are having the same problem. Not recommended."
1,Poor Quality,"I bought this red Crock-Pot brand crockpot for my wife as a Christmas present to replace our old Rival crockpot that had a broken handle. Within only a few months the crockpot insert for the new Crock-Pot brand crockpot had cracked and it was leaking a small amount of fluid out the bottom on to the top of the heating element. The leak got worse over the next two months. We wound up switching back to our old Rival crockpot that we had been using for the three preceding years. I don't know if the Crock-Pot brand people are having all of their products built in a foreign country now, but apparently the workmanship is very poor quality. I would not buy this product."
1,Cooks way too hot,"Really doesnt work as advertised at all. I followed the instructions for a roast. It called for cooking the meat on low for 10 hours. Luckily I happened to be around the Crockpot that day and happened to look at the roast. Imagine my surprise when looking at the roast after about 5 hours to cooking to discover it was fully cooked.Kind of defeats the purpose of a slow cooker if you cant even leave it for a work day without it overcooking your food.I speculate that the maker was worried about bacteria developing at the temperatures Crockpots used to cook at so dialed up the temperature, but I just dont know.The thing is unuseable to me so the purchase resulted in a waste of money."
1,Don't waste your money,"I wanted to replace my crock pot that I have had for ages. It was a Hamilton Beach and it worked fine but the handle separated from the lid and it was hard to use. I looked online and found the original crock pot I had when I was first married, thinking it would service me as well. I got it yesterday and used it today and it was awful. I had soup cooking for 8 hours and the carrots were barely cooked and I had put them in my food processor to make them small before cooking. The soup was not hot; oh, it was warm but not hot as soup should be. I am so sorry I bought it. I am going to get a slow cooker that I can use at the Costco and chuck this one. Since I used it I can't return it and I am so disappointed. This is the first thing I bought on Amazon that I was not satisfied with because usually Amazon has good stuff. Don't buy this one; it is awful. I would not trust it to cook anything else."
2,Busted have broken up and...,"...Charlie Simpson is now in a band called fightstar. If you like busted then you probably wont like them. But as i hated busted's music i found fightstar to be refreshingly heavy. Think nickleback but harder, with the ocassional screaming. Charlie has finaly let loose and im happy for him. But he still shouldent walk around in a tool t-shirt."
5,Reminescence of the Undertones,I bought this for my 12 year old son who really likes this band and found myself liking them just as much. They remind me of the Undertones (Busted cover one of their songs on this album) in their style and garage band sound. Sure beats a lot of the boring stuff that's around these days.
5,Busted-NOT A BOYBAND,"For the record, Busted is not manufactured, they got together themselves and then went to find a deal, they DO write their own songs (and when they say something stupid, they're only playing around) and they DO play their own instruments, I've looked into the matter myself because I can play all of their songs on guitar, bass, and drums, and I've studied tapes of them playing live. It's definitely them. And they are proud to be pop, with a rock edge (i.e. the cover Teenage Kicks, 3AM, She Wants To Be Me). So quit your whining, there's no shame in being pop, because Busted is here to stay. One last thought, the Beatles were young lads who were definitely pop and played their own instruments, and they didn't even alwayswrite their own songs! Why not go bash them instead?"
5,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS BAND!!!!!,"For those of you who have teenagers, like teen music, or have teens themselves who like upbeat music... you will like this band just as much as me!!!!"
5,Great CD,"I first found out about Busted when I saw a premotional ad on the television. I immediatley went out and picked up the album. The C.D is an awesome mix of punk, pop, and humour. The lyrics are witty and their voices are entrancing. Not only are they incredibly clever, they're not bad to look at. If you're a fan of Relient K, Simple Plan, Blink 182, Good Charlotte, or New Found Glory, I suggest picking up this album, you won't be disappointed.-Tessa"
5,You must buy this album!!!!,"If you haven't heard of Busted, you're missing out! Busted are a pop-rock band from the UK. If you need some comparisons, their music is similar to New Found Glory, Foo Fighters, Blink-182, etc. I found out about Busted last April or May and have loved them ever since. I bought their first UK album and loved it so of course I had to buy this one. Busted did not disappoint. This album rocks!! This album is a mix of their first and second albums, so if you like a Busted song that isn't on this album, just buy the other ones! They are all worth it! Busted is an awesome addition to any music collection."
5,I LOVE IT!,I love Busted's self-titled album. They are unique. There is nothing quite like them! They ROCK! All their songs have a certain humor in them....which I love! This is a wonderful album! BUY IT!
5,America meet Busted!!!!!,"I heard of Busted while watching MTV2 ,it was a show based on them ,trying to concord America,called America or Busted .First ,I though that they were just some wanna be's,until I heard some of their songs (including their #1 song What I go to School for!).That when I knew this rock band(NOT BOY BAND)would become succesful here!Trust me this CD will make wanna get off your butt and jam out loud!!!Maybe even make YOU wanna be in a sweet band like them!!!!!!!"
1,what a load of british tripe,im from uk and thought i would check out if busted were popular in america or not and it seems to be so. Im so happy about that. I know now it seems why only give it one star if im happy about that but im happy about that because it means hopefully there pathetic wankers will leave our country and move to yours so i dont have to hear anymore about stinking busted.So come on america love them please. Take them away from us.
4,Busted: UK pop-punk band rocks the US,"This album from Busted is a great CD if you like the pop-punk sound. The album features the band's single, ""What I Go To School For"", about a guy who falls in love with his teacher, Ms. Mackenzie. The song is very comical, featuring lyrics such as ""So she may be thirty-three/But that doesn't bother me"". Many of the other songs are comical, too, such as ""Year 3000"", a song about, of course, the year 3000, which talks about going to the future and seeing boybands all over the place (not much different than a few years ago, actually), and everyone living underwater. Other highlight of the album include the songs, ""Crashed The Wedding"" and ""Air Hostess."" I would have to say Busted is a great album for all pop-punk fans. If you like this genre, get this album!"
4,Wicked!!!,"Busted's self-titled album is totally amazing! I love Busted so much and their songs are hilair! I love ""Who's David"" and ""Falling For You."" Everyone should buy... it is the best ever!!!"
1,manufactured boy band,"these guys are a manufactured boy band to cash in on the punk rock fad, then again so were the sex pistols, THANKS ENGLAND!"
5,It's Busted ALL OVER AGAIN!!!,"AWESOME songs...every song on this CD is awesome. I wish they would have released their original album (from the UK) in America rather than creating a mix of their previous albums. I still recommend it. The 'ballads' are just as good as the punk songs and you can't help but smile with songs like Air Hostess, What I Go To School For, and She Wants to Be Me. The lyrics are the best part, so definitely READ them when you buy it!!!"
3,This One's Lacking 'Balls'...,"I have several of these 'Balls' on VHS and was happy to hear that they were to be reissued on DVD, but was disappointed with the results for several reasons. First, the sound quality hasn't been updated - a definite drag in our digital era. Second, the selections leave a bit to be desired; it's like they went for the obvious rather than include the obscure - example: no Ian Anderson, Robert Plant being backed by a band that included Mick Karn and Phil Collins as a rhythm section (a smokin' first),along with Gary Brooker (Procol Harum) on keys. This band did an amazing version of 'Whiter Shade Of Pale', and also played behind Pete Townsend and Kate Bush (represented on a smaller scale here). And there's too much acoustic stuff to constitute real rock. Thirdly, the video itself hasn't been cleaned up let alone remastered, making this lackluster, lackadaisical and lacking true balls..."
3,Could of used an audio and video upgrade,"If you aren't a fan of [primarily] British comedy but love British music, this DVD is a compilation of the Secret Policeman's Balls [concerts]. You can't really use the term ""Rocks"" as most of the DVD is acoustic.On the negative side, they didn't do much to improve the audio or video [still specs in the video] and maybe they had little choice but audio fades aren't great.On the near positive side, there is also over an hour of interview footage with most of the musicians including a big chunk of recent interviews from Pete Townshend. The interviews are both old and new. What I didn't like much is the editing/splicing."
4,Un documento histórico. Excelentes actuaciones,"Actuaciones de antologia, como las de Sting, Phil Collins y principalmente Pete Townshend, demostrando que fue y es un gran guitarrista armónico, tiene un manejo ritmico de u guitarra inigualable. También el duo de Clapton / Beck, en fin es un concierto inperdible!!!"
4,The Lord is my Shepard...,A very good book on the insight of the 23rd Psalm. Elizabeth George brings things out in this Psalm that will bring comfort to your life.
4,Slap Bass Instructional Video,I found this video to be very helpful. I wish it had gone further but it takes the slap beginer through the steps to get started.
1,"Nothing new, nothing profound. Don't waste your money!","I bought the video. The reception is not good and the video does not contain anything new. We all know to practice psychic abilities by guessing what is on the back of cards that contain different shapes. Developing your psychic abilities includes more than guessing until you are right. It is about clearing, balance and strengthening your intent in the spiritual realm."
4,"Good performance,minimal capability,reasonable price.","We were looking for a low price, portable cassette tape player with good voice reproduction that operates on house current.The Sony CRSB15 does this very well. In addition, radio reception (both AM and FM) is reasonably good and music reproduction quality is acceptable."
5,Old book under new name - still a good read,"combination of three of Heilein's best books, Tunnel in the sky, Time for the Stars, and Citizen of the Galaxy."
2,So-so,"All of the tales are really pulpy, loaded with poor dialogue- wooden and stilted, weak characterization (especially females), and nothing really memorable occurs- in short, they are like bad movie serials. It's amazing just to compare juvenile sci fi written now, to that written half a century ago. Modern juvenilia, such as Nick Sagan's Idlewild, is enthralled with The Matrix-like pretensions, trying to seem hyper-cool, whereas Heinlein's limp efforts are more like a cross between futuristic seeming industrial films and Boy Scout propaganda.The three novels are Tunnel In The Sky, Time For The Stars, and Citizen Of The Galaxy....Heinlein is very heavyhanded, in this and all three books. To read these books and then read Stranger In A Strange Land, published just a few years later, suggests that Heinlein made a quantum jump upward in writing ability. Read the later book, and save these books to fill out your Heinlein library, if you're so inclined. That's about all they're really any good for."
5,Sports Explosion,"Sports Explosion has a driving high energy beat songs include; Come Baby Come; Get Ready for This; I Like to Move It; Mony Mony; Dance to the Music, The Twilight Zone, The Power, Na Na Hey Hey, and More... DJ's Choice does a fine job mixing Sports Explosion and it sounds great with a sub and fine for sports of all kinds including dance."
4,Great CD,This is a great CD expect the YMCA song. The YMCA recording on this CD is really chesse sounding.
1,It's missing something.,"A SHEATH? Like a normal sword? The Sword of Omans either rested in a shrine-like room in their home base, or was carried in the Claw-Sheild. Like the others before me said, the Eye of Thundera is just wrong, sideways with 'roar' lines. At least they didn't use a hologram sticker that changed from the Eye to the symbol.When I first saw this in the tiny thumbnail picture my heart skipped a beat. Wheee, I thought, that's great! But then I saw it. It's... well, crap. Everyone who reviewed it is right."
2,My two cents,"The eye of thundera is so completely off... here's my theory. This sword was made by same cheap knock off company who wanted a thundera-like sword, without buying licenses to have the real logo. Probably had a blue oval shaped jewel in the middle. Then someone else came along and said ""wow that looks just like the thundercats sword!"" So they bought the swords.. then realizing the jewel is supposed to be round not oval.... ""ok let's stick the cat's head in ... um and make roaring/bad breath lines to make it look like we meant it to be oval shaped for that reason"" and there you have it... near garbage. I wont give it 1 star just because it looks pretty good aside from the most important part. I wonder if this can be modified with a little effort. I might buy one and try."
2,Nice looking blade,but the 'eye of thundera' being sideways and the wavey roar lines take ALOT away from it
1,"Close, but not close enough","The logo would have to be right, before I would consider it. It was a centerpiece for the whole series, and the fact that it's off will stand out to every fan of the show."
1,Embarrassed,"I bought as a gift for my brother. Embarrassed to give as a gift, not sure what to do with it, cause its not worth returning when you take into account how much ill lose on shipping to me, return shipping and their restocking fee crap. Even if the 'eye' looked like a cats eye when the eye of thundera was closed it would be worth it. The picture doesnt show how poor the jewel in the middle is. Such a waste of 50 bucks. Even a sticker over the crappy jewel thing would be better!"
2,Not just like the cartoon!,"As plenty of others have stated before, the shape of and the insignia within what is supposed to be the Eye of Thundera is incorrectly made. Additionally, the hilt appears rather short.I didn't give this one star because by itself, it does seem like a decent-looking sword. However, to say that this ""replica"" is ""just like the cartoon"" is quite false, plain and simple."
1,ARE YOU KIDDING ME,"like everyone else on here, i was so happy to see this sword, and then when i looked at the pictures i almost had a heart attack. You have to be kidding me. Notice that the only people that like this sword are people that werent really that much of fans of the show. If you are a true fan, you would never buy this sword. I have been waiting for ages for this sword and have been totally let down."
1,just wrong,"whoever made this sword is a moron. If you know the show you can tell why. if not, read the reviews before me"
5,I Still Love The Transformers!,"I was ecstatic to learn that they had the original Transformers on DVD. I am share the cartoon I loved as a child with my children! And let me tell you, my oldest boy is 5 and he asks to see this DVD every single day."
1,Not impressed / can't recommend at all.,"I was not impressed at all with the video. I think that it relied too much on [very] old martial arts video footage, threaded together with useless narrative dialogue and even less actual footage that was unique to this video. The whole video is based just on a fantasy/hollywood depiction of martial arts.I think the whole premise of the video was shallow due to it being based soley on examples in other videos. There were no interviews with any martial artists at all! END"
3,not a set of 2 tables,Description falsely leads you to believe you will received 2 tray tables. Only received 1 !
3,like a play you could not hear,The actual reading is like listening to a shakespearean play given in a theater with a single microphone in the circle of speakers and each speaker being at least ten feet from the microphone. Terrible for learning anything.
5,Funny Movie!,I watched this movie at a screening in NYC a couple months ago and it was hilarious! There were a good amount of scenes where I was cracking up! Definitely a good movie to watch if you are looking for some humor.
5,Laid Off,"Laid Off is a funny, well written, well directed and acted out by a group of very talented actors who make light of today's current economic conditions and open the bright light of humor, to cast down upon bad news.CJ Moebius, aka Mike La Gante, is great! I bought several copies for friends who've been, Laid Off and they agree...it's ""Hysterical""Refreshing humor is the greatest gift to all who are suffering during these terrible economic times.Laughter may just be the new, ""Opiate of the people""."
5,Laid off,"Great movie,hilarious,i defiantly recommend it,had to buy my self a copy after watching it.Its hard t find a good comedy these days, Laid off was def a hit"
5,CJ Moebius is a SWAG MONSTER,"This movie was hilarious. I haven't purchased a DVD in a long time, but this movie was so funny that I had no choice. I haven't laughed that hard in a long time. Who is this guy CJ Moebius? That boy is SWAGGIN out here. Do yourselves a favor and pick up a copy of this movie NOW!"
5,Big Screen Movie Must !!!!!!!!!!!!,This over the top hilarious indie is the gift that keeps on giving! A lifetime of laughs! Moebius is a standout! Buy it today!
4,An insightful book about dealing with changes,"_Cattail Moon_ is definately not the most realistic of all books for young adults, but it is definately one of the best. Throughout the book the reader is thrown for different twists and turns that inspire critical thinking as to what he or she would do in the same situation. Although I am no musician I felt as though I could really relate to Julia. The ending I tried not to agree with but, as heartbreaking as the ending was, it seemed to be the only ending the book could have without sounding like an overdone fairy tale. That's the cold reality that the book gave that made it so hard to put down and so unforgettable. Kudos to Jean Thesman for this one and all the others of hers that I've read."
3,a good read,"I read this book when I was in middle school and recently reread it. I found myself thinking some of the same thoughts I did nearly a decade ago when I first read it--I like Julia because she is not perfect and young teenage girls will be able to relate. As a round character the reader gets to mature right along with Julia as she handles the changes in her life amongst her best friend Emmaline back home, her new friend Beth, and of course, Luke. The mystery of Christine draws the reader in further. This book will engage pre-teen to early teenage girls very well as it is written at the proper reading level for this age reader."
1,What is this book?,"What is this book? I found it kind of boring and Bizarre. It certainly wasn't hard to put down, and it didn't have much of a point. I stuck with it, hoping it would get better, but Nada. It was rather weird, too. I think there are better books out there, like the ones by Sharon Creech and Caroline Cooney."
2,"Looks good, plays terrible","It sure looks good, and yeah the idea sounds fun, but believe me...it isn't. This was the second game I bought for my dreamcast and I was extremely dissapointed. The controls are terrible. Sure you could spend an hour tweaking it in garage mode, but even after that it's still not near satisfactory, and nobody wants to have to go through that. The games graphics are pretty nice, and freestyle mode is fun...for the first 15 mins. The tracks are too demanding for the games controls...the last track in the game I found my self going about 10 mph...no joke...just so I wouldn't slide or spin out. If you're looking for a real game buy Soul Calibur...that game alone could sell the dreamcast."
3,limited racing appeal with above average courses,"Although this game offers many advantages, I hope that dreamcast will soon have a far superior off road racing game. This game is often stagnant as far as excitement goes. Has some interesting course works - verbal dialog between racers grows tiresome."
1,very bad game,"I rented this game, and I was glad I did. If this is what sega spent a year and a half on you can run and hide. This is one of the worst raceing games I have seen. There is no sense of speed, and the control sucks, how they could put this game out is a joke. If this is what to come you should save your money for the psx 2."
5,Low angle driver causes low scores!,"Although I already owned a 10.5 degree Dd5, I wanted another one for my Tahoe golfing. However, I decided, at the suggestion of a golfing buddy, to go for the lower angle. Boy is he ever sorry that he made that suggestion! I've probably paid for the sucker already from the spots I've won! As much as I liked the 10.5, the 8.5 is much better. I get an extra 20 yards and more due to great roll and spin. Of course the nano shaft is doing its thing--straight, high clubhead speed, low torque--just much better with the 8.5.They call me ""Stinger"" now on the course--and I love it!"
1,Annoying,"This will be short:Have you ever seen one of those books that looks like it will have a lot of good info on how to do something, open the cover and realize that it's just a ""this is nice stuff that you could do if you knew how, but I'm not going to tell you the details of how..."" book? This is that book.To add to that, it's outdated, and even though all the products introduced and shown were of one brand, they didn't even take a picture of them but instead someone drew a picture of the can sitting there..."
2,"Once the only book on the subject, it's badly out of date","The example cars and boats on the cover are a dead give away. Of historical interest only. Common in libraries, if you're too cheap to BUY a better book for less than the cost of the materials for even a minor repair, by all means, check it out, as the techniques of most simple, common repairs have not changed, but don't waste your coin getting your own copy."
2,"Not durable, and you can buy it in many places","Well, it is a cool product, and good idea to use. But the bulb was broken in first 3 days. We put the second one on. Dont know how long this second one will last. We used it only few minutes in the morning, when we need to get some cloth out of closet.Also, it is not on line product only. I found Bed Bath Beyond has it and CVS has it. They sell 9.99. Without extra bulb. But still, misleading to say online only."
1,Save Your Money,We bought two of these for the back of the closet. I used it the day I put it up and left it on for under two hours...and it was burnt out. Not worth the ten dollars each that I paid.
3,Makes things visible...,"OK, now I have a light in my closet and it shines pretty bright, at least when the battery is fully charged. You'll be glad to use rechargeables because even with very light use the bulb empties the battery very quickly. I use eneloop rechargeable batteries which hold their charge much better than others. Overall, just a so so solution for closet lights."
1,Piece of JUNK,This product is an absolute piece of junk. I recently purchased this item and feel I was scammed. This product gives off very little light and the batteries do not last long. Thought I was receiving three of these lights and only got one. Pure Scam.
3,"If you want results, you may have to buy 2 of them.","I purchased a set of two, to be used above a shower in a bathroom with low lighting. The first light alone didn't really help, but with the two, sufficient light was provided. The sticky-tape on the back wore out within minutes; be sure to screw them to the wall, or it's just not enough to hold.The seam where the plastic meets was weak, and the whole ""bulb"" broke right in half almost instantly. Luckily, the base is a screw-in, so I just held the pieces together and screwed them back in. It's hardly noticeable, and it's held together pretty well for the most part.I'm just glad I bought two of them, or I would've had a plastic bulb in two parts, that provided almost next to no light. Next time I need to brighten up an area, I'll be spending a little more for the Thomas & Betts closet lights."
1,Wont stick,I bought these bulbs and was hoping to use them around a few rooms and in a few cabinets. However they dont stick for anything. I put up two of them and they both fell. One of them fell from a shelf and when it fell it broke the light. It takes 4 batteries and they get drained quickly.
4,pretty good,"i'm impressed with these lights. they're not as bright as a regular bulb, but they work just as good. i've had them in two of my closets and they did the job. if i couldn't see something i just took the bulb off the holder. only problem is when i took them out of the closet when i was moving, it took the drywall off, but that was an easy fix. i've never had mine on long enough i guess for the bulb to go out quicly, but they turned on everytime i turned them on."
3,"Great Concept, 1 out of 2 works","I bought two of these and put them both in closets. I have an older apartment that has no lighting in any closets or hallways. I find that one of them works great, however the other burned out within two days. I would still highly recomend this product, as the one works great!"
2,I was chargered for two but only got 1,"It works pretty good but i was chargered for 2 but never got the other one , i tried 2 get it but never showed up"
3,"Works, but adhesive needs to be better!","The bulb works fine (although it is dim- what do you expect for $10) and is practical for closets, or for power outages. Westinghouse has an innovative product with this bulb (in terms of having a light bulb that requires no wires, or electricity and is portable). Long term durability is questionable, however, especially the cheap adhesive on the back of the base. The bulb/base has fallen many times from my closet wall, so I needed to glue the base to the wall to get it to stick (the bulb can still slide out of the base for use during emergencies). If you need a low priced/affordable emergency light/closet light than this light will do. If you're looking for an elaborate, bright, durable light look elsewhere..."
2,Good invention but......,"I like the whole idea of this product, however the bulbs only last a little over a week, the product came with an extra bulb, the 1st one died in 5 days the second died in 3. Very disappointed."
1,Can't get replacement bulbs,"Save your money. This looks like a great item but TeleBrands, the company that sells it AND offers FREE replacement bulbs, no longer supports it. No replacement bulbs means you have a nice piece of junk with a pull-string on it."
4,Worked really well for me,"I tried a few other ""sticks"" and battery push lights and this is the only one that gave a decent amount of light. Don't expect it to rival a wired electric bulb, but I have a small closet and it lights it well enough to see my shirts. If I look funny, I can't blame it on my dark closet anymore. I had it up for over a year and just recently it fell off the wall (a computer keyboard may have fallen into it) and stopped working. I'm going to buy 4-5 of them here because Bed Bath & Beyond doesn't stock them anymore. That's how satisfied I am."
4,Good Form...reasonable performance,"I'm not sure what everyone is crying about. I use my Stick Up Bulb out in the shed. Once, when the power went out, I went out to the shed and retreived my Stick Up Bulb and put it in our bedroom. The battery lasted about 3 hours before the light faded out. bighter than a candle, but not as bright as a regular 25 Watt bulb; still, for the price it's not a bad product. I've never had any issues with the bulb burning out that other's talk about."
2,Ok buy not as bright as I wished.,"Great concept but it's not as bright as I needed for my closet and it seemed to use a lot of energy, the batteries died very quickly. This is better than the big round stick up ones you push to turn on."
3,Not a standard size light bulb,"I purchased one to test, hoping I could replace the bulb with a special standard-sized remote controlled color changing LED light bulb and buy a few dozens of these. However, when it arrived, I discovered that it is NOT a standard size light bulb... instead, it's a plastic cover the size of a standard sized light bulb. The real light bulb is about the size of a marble, mounted on a post inside the cover, making the entire contraption far larger than it needs to be and making the appearance misleading. I was disappointd."
2,Ok once bulbs are upgraded,"I got these knowing the bulbs were useless and intendingto replace them with LEDs. Once this is done, the lightsare acceptably bright and last reasonably long with fourAA cells. According to my calculations, the battery lifeshould be about 25 times greater with the LEDs.Why the vendor has been unable to figure this out is beyond me."
1,Just doesn't last.,"I have no problem with the brightness of this product. Our problem was that it drained battery life like I couldn't believe. We didn't leave it on, but did need to turn it on every morning in the closet. Every week we found ourself replacing the batteries."
2,Ok,"If you are totally desperate for a little light, in a very dark area, this would work. But, be aware it provides very very low light. Reminds me of a 3 watt night light. Pictures of this item make it seem brighter than it is. Beware."
2,Light Bulbs do not last,"I have several of these for my closets and I would have to agree with others the bulbs do not last. And if it isn't the bulbs it's the batteries. These lights eat batteries. I was hoping to buy the adpaters on here, but I can't find them."
1,Didn't Work for me,This product my be useful for someone else but they didn't work for me. I bought them to provide light down my staircase so when you went down in the middle of night you wouldn't need to turn on the overhead light because it's so bright it would wake up my sons. But the first night I used it the bulb burnt out before I went back after 20/30 minutes. So the next time I use another one and the same thing happened.
1,Eats Batteries,The unit itself fell off the wall. Pulling the on/off string usually brought down the unit. I fastened it up with screws. The concept was still good. I put in the batteries. 24 Hours later the unit failed to turn on. I put in new batteries and those batteries were dead in 24 hours. Then I realized that what we have is not a light but a battery=eater. Do not buy this idea without a money back guarantee.
2,Currently Looking for a Replacement,"Pro: They do work and have options for installing with screws or sticky tape.Con: The lights use up battery power way to fast. I had these lights in my closet and keeping the light on, long enough to put a basket of clothes away caused the light to drain battery power. I even used rechargeable batteries and having to wait for them to charge and them having them drain power within 1-2 days, they are not worth the purchase if looking to use them in a closet.Also, the light iteself, is not very bright. I had to use 4 in a 12 ft walk in closet (in length, and the closet is only 3 feet deep), just so I could see all my clothing.Final Thought: They will work for you, but you must consider your usage. I DO NOT reccommend them for use in a frequently used area.....for an occassional, barely used, closet or stairway---maybe, but even then, they are not bright enough to light a full stairway (already tried it)."
1,Stick on bulb,I should have read these reviews prior to purchasing two off ebay. These really are quite worthless. Very little light even with two in the closet. Have just managed to burn out the bulb in one and see that others have had similar experiences. Reommendation: Don't buy
1,not impressed,"this was a total disappointment, it was like a candle light, it did not provide enough illumination for a small closet, i would not recommend it. Total waste of money."
1,didn't work at all,"put the batteries in (yes, correctly) - didn't work at allwaste of time (they didn't allow ""no stars"" here)"
4,"Tom, Tom and Jonni in a Racier Title","This book collects the first six issues of the title comic. Each issue has stories about Tom Strong (and supporting cast), Young Tom Strong (while he is still a boy), and the time traveling hero Jonni Future (heir to the mantle of Johnny Future).These stories are racier and more risque that those usually found in the Tom Strong books. For instance, in one story, Tesla Strong sneaks out to party and have sex with an alien. Jonni Future is always in situations that include very buxom women (including herself) and various states of undress.Overall I found the stories to be entertaining and especially like the classic pulp feel of the Jonni Future stories. Clean art is used in most of the stories and you will probably recognize the work of some of the guest artists. But while humor and action are prevalent readers should be aware of the more adult nature of these stories."
3,Good to see Art Adams Art,"Overall this book is enjoyable if you are a Tom Strong fan. The 'Terrific Tales' venue allows for different stories than in the regular title, so these stories do a have different flavor to them. Personally, I purchased this book for the Jonni Future stories because of the Art Adams art and the silly pulp feel to them."
2,A piece of junk,"Don't be fooled by the slick looking design like I was. First of all, the outer metal shell is very delicate and prone to denting, thereby putting its ""slickness"" to a quick end. Secondly, the setting controls are not obvious nor conveniently located, especially if you are fumbling around in a darkened room and half asleep. Thirdly, and most importantly, it is unreliable. A significant amount of the time, the alarm does not come on even though all display indicators suggest that it is set correctly.For $60, you can find a much better unit than this one."
2,Nice to look at but...,"I bought this clock because my other sony clock died on me. I always have had luck with Sony clocks, but after this experience Sony clocks are no longer for me. I couldn't program it, so I took it back to the sales person and he couldn't figure it out either. He suggested I get another one which I did. After one month the alarm has broken. No more Sony clocks!"
3,Great looking! Moderately user friendly.,"I've had this clock radio for several years now and overall, I am pretty happy. It looks awesome and the buttons are all easily accessible. Once you've had it for a while your fingers learn which buttons to hit to turn the alarm on and off. The built in battery back-up has saved me many a time. My biggest complaint is I lost the directions about a year ago and I haven't been able to figure out how to set the alarm to wake up to a radio station since them. Somehow my settings got erased and now all I can wake up to is static. I'm sure it can't be that difficult but at present, it alludes me. The sound is fine for light bedside listening and the display has two settings (bright and not so bright) which is also a nice feature. It does have a limited viewing angle as stated in one of the previous review. Overall, however, I am pleased with the clock."
1,Fuzzy stations,Poor station discrimination. Digital settings are inaccurate (90.7 tunes in best at 90.8 or 90.9 depending upon the day). Not comparable to other Sony products. I was surprised to see this model is still available. Sony would do better to junk them than risk the Sony name on this one . . .
2,Didn't Like It....,"and I love Irish fiction. It just didn't grab me. I don't know, it felt like something I had read before but couldn't put my finger on what. I was bored."
5,FIRST GOOD BOOK I HAVE READ IN A LONG TIME,"I loved this book. It made me laugh, cry. I became addicted to reading this novel..It has been a long time since I have read a quick fun read like this! I recomend this to anyone who is looking for a great novel."
2,Blah and boring,"I looked forward to this book based upon the description. I was hoping for something heartwarming and thought provoking. Sadly, it ws neither.The writing can only be described as tedious. Normally, a very fast reader, I struggled to get through this. The characters lacked any three dimensionality to them and the plot was contrived.I also lent this to a friend, who had much the same things to say about it.Too bad."
4,Letting Go,"The first work of Cecelia Ahern is a bittersweet story about surviving the loss of a love. Easy and fast to read, it tells about every day life how it has to go on, whatever may interrupt it. It's sad and funny at the same time and changes from one moment to the other - just like real life does. Great to fill the evening hours and to read in any place."
2,not wortb your time,"I am not the most critical reader,but evenI need more substance than this.I never felt holly's grief, in factI never felt anything for holly.The author simply tells us she's sad without ever letting the reader experience it.If your over the age of fifteen read something else."
1,Boring,"boring, immature, elementary....very cheesy, very anti-climatic ending, was like this is it? did i really spend all that time reading this?not a good book, spend your time reading something else.. Don't mean to bash C. Ahern's book she has some potential just needs more practice, guidance, and more exciting plot!!"
5,"Wonderful Story of Love and Loss, and Learning to Live Again","This book was wonderful. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I loved it. I laughed, I cried, and I couldn't put it down. I passed it along to my Mother and Sister and they both loved it too. This book is a definite 'must read' for everyone."
3,It was OK,"This is a very poorly written book. Certain aspects of this book made me feel like I was reading the story of an 18 year old opposed to 30. The main character, Holly, is likeable in a cute college kid kind of way. She goes through a rough patch which makes her act in certain ways but the whole documentary video and getting lost at sea situations are just over the top. The book is very easy to read, if you didn't read up on the author you would think that it was written by a 5th grader but overall the book was OK. Near the end I got tired of all her childish and inmature escapades."
4,"Reads like a ""chick flick"" - Loved it!","I really liked it. Nothing too deep, just a nice read about friends and friendship. I hope my husband never leaves me a ""list"". hee hee."
3,something is missing,"i bought this book on impulse bec just by looking at the title i kind of like it already... and to my utter disbelief it did not prove me wrong.. i really like it and and it was so funny that i could not help but laugh visibly i really did not care at that time if others would see me bec. i want them to ask me about the book so that i could recommend it... but towards the end i am not quite impressed w/it bec. it did not matched w/the way the story goes.. i would have been perfectly happy if the story started w/gerry still alive i would be the first one to absolutely accept the ending but the story started w/gerry already out of the picture so, i was really not so attached w/gerry in the first place that is why i thought the ending would be quite different...but all in all the book was really good and i would love to recommend it to someone.. especially that people do have a different view of things so it would be different for them as it is for me..."
5,Mind Stimulation,"I enjoyed reading this book because it wasn't too heavy-going and it was humourous. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants something to take their mind off the real world.I found it a definate page turner and it stimulated my mindVery good, excellent waiting for the next one already!"
3,Charming but predictable,"A good quick read full of likeable characters, it is none the less extremely predictable. I would recommend this book to you in paperback form. If you are looking for a more colorful characters along a similar theme, try ""The Magician's Assistant"" by Ann Patchett."
2,Nice,"It was a nice story, a little sad but it lacked depth and substance. The book was predictable so you are better off watching the movie"
2,Surprisingly Disappointing & Terribly Written,"As an ""International Bestseller"" with a feature film spin off, I bought this book expecting a decent read. Instead, I muddled through it in constant amazement of just how bad the writing was. I couldn't even believe that it had been made into a book until I read somewhere that the author is the daughter of Ireland's Prime Minister.The storyline itself has potential, but all was lost as a result of the author's poor prose and consistently corny dialogue. Bottom line... I would not recommend this book to anyone who reads or thinks above a 5th grade level."
4,such a cute love story,"i had already seen the movie, but there is so much more detail in the book. it is an interesting form of a love story, a story of moving forward, sad yet happy too."
2,didn't really like it....,"I usually really enjoy books like this, but P.S. I love you didn't come together for me. I found the idea of it very interesting, that her deceased husband left her message to open. BUT other then that, all the in-between message opening I found to be sluggish and boring. I don't know if it was her writing style or the story, but it just didn't work. It actually was kind of depressing. I know it must be extremely difficult to get back on your feet again after losing a husband, but now that I think about, is that really something enjoyable to read about? Probably not. It might have been easy to identify with Holly if perhaps you have gone through the same type of loss, but for me it wasn't the best book."
3,Light Reading,"If you are looking for something not very thought provoking and quick, this is it. I can't say I disliked this book but I can't say that it was good enough to keep or recommend either. I found myself not caring one way or the other about the characters. The premise was interesting, I loved the concept however it just didn't work here. I have far better books to read than to have wasted time on this one."
1,"Content had potential, writing style ruined it.","I never finished this book. I gave it a hearty attempt more than once until I realized I felt like I was suffering throught it, and gave up. The storyline grabbed me. I wouldn't doubt that it would have been a wonderful book, had I been able to ignore the horrifying writing of this novel! After trying to ignore the writing, I realized I couldn't. Things didn't always flow correctly and I found myself rereading things to make sense of what was written.If easily bothered by choppy writing and lack of style entirely, skip this book. You'll be happy you did."
2,P.S. Don't Waste Your Money.,"How is this book an ""international bestseller""?? The idea for the book is great, but Cecelia and her proofreader? Not so much. I can't even concentrate on what's going on because the writing is just. that. bad. I think I could have written a better novel in 8th grade. The only reason I rated the book a 2 rather than a 1 is because I couldn't get past the first 100 pages, so maybe it gets better, but from other reviews, I highly doubt it. Go see the movie, I've heard it's good."
2,Trite and somewhat boring,"I was really looking forward to reading this book after seeing the movie trailer with Hilary Swank. It looked like a great, original story. So, I was very dissapointed when I got into it. I understand that poor Holly lost her husband, yet she is so self-centered and wishy-washy throughout the story that it substantially took away from the uniqueness of the ""gift"" left behind to her by her dearly departed husband. This is really just OK, and sort of reads like a young adult novel."
4,Fun Read,"Overall, I enjoyed this book. It was an easy and fun read. I thought the storyline was good and I enjoyed how she showed how life must go on even after a tragedy such as the death of a loved one. Although some of the emotions seemed overly dramatic for simple situations or conversations and some of the actions seemed seemed childish for women their age, this book was a very enjoyable read."
4,A Truly Heartwarming Story,"This book was great, from beginning to end. At times, it was pretty predictable, but that made the story no less heartwarming. I felt like I was right there with the characters and I totally empathized with them. Anyone who loves a good happy read, this was a great book."
1,"I'm so ""shocked"" I want to ""cry""","oh my, this was painful to get through. I only did it because it was a bookclub pick. If I had time on my hands I'd go through and count the hundreds of times characters ""laughed hysterically"" or were ""shocked"" or ""tears spilled"". Such juvenile writing, and no inner substance in the main character. The only well-plumbed depth of feeling related to the sense of loss, but other than that, it felt like writing for a bad sitcom. If you're at all interested in this book, save yourself some money and check it out at the library as you won't be wanting to keep it on the shelf."
2,Movie was way better than the book!,"Rarely is the case that a movie supersedes a book, but after reading P.S. I love you I found the that movie told Gerry and Holly's story such much better. While the book is slightly entertaining, the author fails to attach the reader to Gerry, Holly's deceased husband. He was the driving force behind everything that she did in the book and he's is almost non existent in the pages!"
2,mostly just annoying,"I was not impressed by this book at all. The characters were all immature and VERY unrealistic, with corny dialogue and narration. It was mostly just irritating to read. I did not find the funny parts funny or the emotional/sensitive parts moving. The concept of the notes from the deceased husband seems an interesting idea, but the plot just seemed to drudge along."
3,Movie is being based on this book,"The book was allright, but I bought it because I am a Gerard Butler fan and he will be in the movie with Hilary Swank playing her dead husband. I always like to read the book first and relate it to the movie. I am sure most Gerard Butler fans will be buying this book..and for them, I would recommend it."
1,"This book is very, very bad.","Not much else you can say. It's simply not good.The idea of the plot is ok, but it's poorly executed, the writing is awful, the charactors aren't well drawn, and the dialogue actually hurts as you try to read it.If I could give it 0 stars, I would. Avoid it."
1,awful just awful !,"Dear oh dearthis makes the ""devil Wore Prada "" look like Ann Tyler !it's that badly written .AVOID !"
3,Author has potential. 3 1/2 stars.,This author has potential. I really liked the general idea and storyline of the book due to its creativity. The writing is a little forced and often not very smooth. I enojoyed this book better than some others in the chick-lit category as it was a little bit less predictable.
4,"Very good, but very different from the movie","I loved this book! Just be warned though, if you are expecting it to be like the movie it won't be. But personally, I liked it better this way! Such a great read. It gives you a lot to think about."
2,ps I don't love you,The book was ok. I was disappointed because I saw the Movie first and loved it. This was the first book I have read that the movie was better.
1,"Failing to write what she knows, and failing to keep my attention","The author is clearly writing beyond her scope of life experience or research. The supposed 30-year-old main character is pathetic and unsympathetic, even considering the circumstances of plot.A knack for the visual is apparent, which probably translates well on film, but the excessively true-to-life dialog includes much pointless small talk that does nothing to further the story.I had high hopes for the concept, but it's mired in superfluous fluff."
1,"Cute concept, horrible writing","I really wanted to like this book because I loved the concept and the movie looked cute. However, I couldn't get past the first chapter due to the horrible writing. I agree with other reviews, watch the movie or get it from the library, but don't spend your money. There are other authors out there that are MUCH better. Her concept is great, but she needs to take some creative writing classes!"
4,"PS, I Really Loved ""PS I Love You""!","PS, I Love You is Chick-Lit, but that's a GOOD thing. I like the premise that a husband would love his wife enough to plan her year to gradually bring her out of her mourning. Wouln't it be a wonderful world if there were such a man out there? I don't care how old Cecilia Ahern is, she told a good story. I agree that some of the characters are flawed, they are self-centered (including Holly), but aren't we all? If she had made them all perfect, wouldn't it have been too sickly sweet? I liked this book enough to buy another Ahern book (""Love, Rosie). AND I WAIT IMPATIENTLY FOR THE MOVIE!!!"
2,Lacking depth,"I read this book after hearing about the movie, and I was disappointed. Not bad for a first effort, but all in all, this book was lacking depth. There is so much more the author could have done to develop the chain of events that occurred as the result of the notes. The idea that the book is based on is a good one, but the development of the idea comes up short."
5,P. S. I LOVE YOU,"Loved the book, love the movie. First thought that Hilary Swank would be a mis-cast, NO WAY, she was wonderful!I watch it over and again. Just one of those love stories that actually are spot on. Right up there with ""Love Actually"", ""You've got Mail"" ""The Holiday""."
2,Ehhhh....,I wouldn't say it was a horrible book but it def. took me awhile to get through it. I really had to force myself to read just because i wanted to finish it. The dialogue seems very childlike. There are parts when the characters begin to crack up when nothing funny happened. I can def. see it being turned into a motion picture as it says it will be on the back of the book. Maybe if it was much shorter it would have been better.
1,Common,"I have recently dicovered the whimsy and fun of chick lit. However, I found this bit of chick-lit to be very pedestrian and drab. A common girl, newly widowed, who wallows in her pity party. While some of her reflections on her loss are downright beautiful and worthy of a hanky, the premise of this book could have done without the very naive, meandering, and sloppy writing style. I would like to see how this authoress might actually tell this same tale when she's 40. Ripe with sitcom, easy, shallow laughs, the young women portrayed in this book lack any ounce sophistication. While the idea of this piece is intriquing (her husband leaving her monthly notes after his passing that assist her with moving forward in her life without him) and clever, I found the characters to be boring and very common. Doubtful I will read anything by Ahern again even for escapist fun."
1,lame,such lame and sophomoric writing--should have known when all the publicity was about whose daughter she was instead of her talent.
2,A boring read,"I bought the book because I thought it could potentially be a great idea. Boy was I disappointed. It was very slow, and I really did not care much for the characters! A bit of a disappointment."
2,A rare example of a movie being better than the book,"While the premise of the story is good, the movie did a much better job of capturing the characters. Her writing style needs polish and she writes as a 22 year old pretending to know what it's like to be 30 and widowed. The characters have no depth and you find yourself saying over and over again ""that wouldn't really happen"". Phrases are used repetitively and dialog is weak. There were some charming moments, but overall it reads like a high school paper. The author needs to mature a little and get some life experience. Skip the book and rent the movie."
3,Not Your Usual Chick Lit,I really enjoyed this book. It was kind of cheesy at times but I stuck with it and ended up in tears at the end. It made me not want to take my relationship for granted it was so sweet. It was really simple to read and I whizzed through it. When reading this kind of book I always think I know where the story is heading but I was really surprised with this one.
4,"Great premise, style lacking","Other reviewers have already told the whole story of this book (why do they do that?). I will just say this was a great premise that was lost in the not to par writing style. Ahern is a new novelist that will grow into herself. Unfortunately, this book came early in her career.I enjoyed this book, it reminded me of Bridget Jones. The characters were able to laugh at themselves and were genuine. I would read a sequel to find out how Ahern sees the future of the characters. A sequel may actually show improvement..."
5,A wonderful new author!,"I first came across this book when I saw it highlighted in Cosmo one month. So the next time I was in the library, I snatched it up off the shelf.I love the way this book takes such an honest look into a woman's life. And not just a woman, a YOUNG woman. There are pop culture references in this book that young women can appreciate, as well as true emotions that anyone could relate to. And the story of how Holly goes through her mourning period is just brilliant. I am still wowed that someone so young (only 22!!) wrote such a deep and insightful story about the life of a young widow.I would reccomend this book to just about anyone. And not just women, either, because I really think that men could get something out of it, too."
3,P.S i love you,"the cover is worn out, but considering that the inside of the book looks awesome i did not mind. pay hardly anything for the novel is great. I'm satisfied."
4,Great Book,"P.S. I Love You was one of the best books I have ever read. Once I started to read I could not put it down. Cecelia Ahern really makes you feel like you are there with the characters. You will laugh, cry, and totally fall in love with the book."
3,ChickLit From Ireland,"Cecelia Ahern's debut novel, which became a best-selling book far beyond Ireland, the novel's setting, can be described as a perfect representative of the fiction subgenre often (slightly derisively) referred to as ChickLit. Turned into an equally successful movie, whose screenplay moves away from the book in that its protagonist is not a heartbroken Irish widow but an American lady (played by Hillary Swank) mourning her recently deceased Irish husband, PS, I LOVE YOU is clearly targeted at female readers - a ladies' book, easily accessible ChickLit from Ireland.To be honest, I, a dumb and insensitive male, did not find the novel to be half as heartwrenching as the vast majority of its female readers. Still, by and large, it is fairly entertaining if somewhat cliché-ridden and about 100 pages too long.Not to be recommended for young turks or any other male readers whose romantic strain is still safely locked away in hibernation."
1,No originality whatsoever... stolen plot?,"I haven't read the novel... only the main plot summary. There was a Korean movie, released almost a decade before this book was ever published, with a VERY similar storyline: newlywed couple, husband asks the wife what she wants most from him, she asks for a letter, he's never written a love letter before but tries anyways, gets a BRAIN TUMOR, passes away, and then a few days later the wife starts receiving letters from her husband... letters telling her how much he loved her. It just seems way too similar to be coincidence... I mean, he dies the EXACT SAME WAY. I'm 25 now (turning 26 in October), and I remember watching the movie when I was a sophomore or junior in highschool. It's called ""Byun-jih"" (Letter), if you're interested. Way to go Ahern... you, like Paolini, don't have a single original thought in your head. Nice."
2,Disappointing,"I'd recommend this one only if you are somehow inexplicably stuck with NOTHING else to read. I had such high hopes for this buzz book but after the first 50 pages or so I found I had to force myself to pick it up each day and trudge as many pages as I could stand. Honestly, there are just so many other wonderful novels out there -- chick-lit or otherwise. You're not missing anything here."
4,Surprising,I expected this to be a light read and was surprised to find how moving it turned out to be. A very clever plot adds to this touching story about a woman recovering from the death of her beloved husband. It is a little too sugary in many instances but that does not take away from the overall effect of the book.
5,"Powerful words, adaptable to life!","I just finished this book a few days ago and to be honest I could not put the book down! It was amazing. I have been doing a lot of reading lately, but until now have not found a book that is so insightful. If you have lost someone special in your life whether through death or a break up this book will speak to you. Holly goes through the trials and tribulations of getting over Gerry after he dies. It is sweet and written for the heart. Life is a journey that we all have to take and it is not always easy, but instead of living from the past......use the past to springboard you into the future. I recommend this book to anyone who is going through a difficult time in his or her life!"
2,A book if you enjoy reading other people's journals...,"Unfortunately this book did not meet my requirements of a proper novel. The writing is elementary, characters undeveloped and not interesting. Perhaps the novelist will mature with experience."
3,P.S. I love Gerry....,"I am single and looking forward to meeting my soulmate. I want friends like Sharon and Denise...I love the ending (Rob).Great job on your first novel, Cecelia!!!! I wouldn't expect any male out there who would enjoy this book. P.S. let me know if I'm wrong."
1,Is there nothing less than 1 star?,I started reading this book with an open mind. By page 10 I felt I correcting a 10 year old's English assignment. It is awful!! Do not waste your money. The idea is good but it is written by a girl who obviously has no idea of grief or death in her little world. I really struggled to finish it.I can only guess that as she is the daughter of the Irish PM that it was published. To publishers out there...Do publish tripe like this ever again. Really REALLY BAD!!!!
1,"Disappointing read, but the list idea is great!","I admit I'm not a fan of Bridget Jones. But I love Mariann Keyes and Carole Matthews if that helps! I was curious about the hype for PS I Love You. Probably shouldn't have read it after 'Crow Lake' and 'The Five People You Meet in Heaven', though. Ms Ahern's writing is very ' clunky': even amateurish in places. I know she's 22. And publishing a debut novel at that age is a huge achievement. But then Zadie Smith was 21 when she wrote White Teeth ..... (I think!)I loved the idea of the list. Thought that was so original. But something never clicked for me as to why list making was so important to their relationship. Was Holly disorganized? She didn't seem so ...Sharon and Denise were great! As was the funky baby sister with her pink hair. The secondary characters were the reason I finished the book. Holly, the heroine, never seemed three dimensional to me.Honestly? I couldn't recommend it. Sorry!"
1,BORING!,"I found the premise of this book to sound entertaining. A chick book....After five chapters, I was so bored and uninterested in it..that I left it (on purpose) at my nail care place. Didn't even finish reading it....Total yawner!"
2,Immature,"I bought this book, the premise sounded like something I would really like. I also noticed some pretty good reviews.I was very surprised at how much I didn't like it. I couldn't even get through the whole book. The writing was immature and shallow, and very repetitive. Maybe I am too old for the type of book, although I do like some of the new ""chick lit"". I am going to send it to someone else, and let her try it, maybe it was just me.Anyway, if you are reading this review, maybe you should try to get a copy from the library, or borrow one, or even wait for paper. I hate writing bad reviews, I would just rather not say anything at all,but here it is with apologies to the author."
1,Quite possibly the worst book I've ever read.,"I bought this book second-hand because I was curious. The film is a guilty pleasure of mine, and I was hoping that the book would be better (which is usually the case). I'm afraid to say that this book is incredibly poorly written and not a thing like the film. Truly, the film was ""loosely"" based on the book and is, itself, far from brilliant. Honestly, it's not even good, but I do have affection for it. The book, however, is abysmal."
1,PS I love you,"The story line seems really good, but i had to stop reading the book at about the third chapter, because of all the swear words. I did not appreciate that very much at all. Especially because the other book that I read from this auther did not have any bad words in it. I was not expecting that at all."
1,?,I have not received any items from this order. If you would send them to me I would be glad to give you a review.
2,Poor Execution on a good idea!,"The premise for the story is good. But, the writing is amateurish, too silly and not believable. Worse, there is no character development. Got halfway through and couldn't finish it. There are too many good writers to spend time with this one."
2,Great idea! Poor writing,Great idea for a story. Writing is that of a child writing an essay at school.Would not have this deal if it was not for her Dad being Prime Minister of Ireland and we know that those guys are all taking backhanders and favours.
1,WORST BOOK!,Pretty much the worst book I have ever bought!!! The reviews were great for this book but it was just plain bad! I would never again by another book by this author. There was no grasping point to this book!
3,Bittersweet... A love story in reverse.,"This is a unique tale of love, death, and the cruel and healing sides of the passing of time.I found it sad, tender and hopeful. The story of Holly is a love story; but her love life seems to be over on the very first page; however, we get to see glimpses of the love and the life she had when her husband Gerry still lived. Gerry left her a ""list of things to do"" to help her get by and put her life back together when he was no longer with her. This list he carefully crafted and mailed to Holly's parents' house before dying, will force her to face life, let her grief go and it'll warm your heart and make you sad but it'll inspire you and make you think of the many things you would do to lessen the heartbreak of the ONE you love for as long as you remain breathing.This book makes you feel human, vulnerable, surprised and full of faith in those tiny miracles of love."
4,Cute book,"This book sounded sweet, and it lived up to my expectations. I'd think you'd have to believe in the concept of soul mates to really enjoy the book, though, because it is very sentimental. There really wasn't anything NOT to like about the book, but I didn't love it, maybe because I'm not as much of a romantic as Holly."
2,These covers pretty much suck,"Sturdy, but they don't grip the doorknobs well enough for an ADULT to open. I try to open my children's door to check on them at night, and I make enough noise trying to get it open that I normally startle them awake. I'd feel like an idiot if it weren't for the fact that the covers don't grip on ANY type of handle, which I've tried. We have more than one type of door handle in the house."
5,Door Knob Safety Cover,Works wonders! I am very satisfied with this purchase. This is a great product if my 3 year old can not distroy it! I would have purchased more if I had known it would have worked so well.
1,worst,These are the worst of the 3 types of knob covers that I have bought. It is very challenging to grip the knob to get it open.
1,Didn't work,My toddler figured out how this worked and came off in minutes. It definitely would not keep her out of somewhere she wanted to go!
4,"At first, terrible, but they ""broke in"" and now work!","These were awful at first, huge disappointment. Adults couldn't even squeeze and grip them, just like all the poor reviewers said. But Laziness prevailed and I didn't take them off. Now, after 8 weeks or so of being on being used, being squeezed, the plastic has softened up. They grip just fine and adults can do it. Sadly, it's still too hard for my 6 year old, so now she can't get in the bathroom to pee or go outside when really, she does not need permission, it's just for the two year olds. That's a little annoying, but if anyone feels like it's worth waiting to break this in, they are a fabulous child lock."
3,My 3 year old takes them off.,I have had these on our door and it was working great. It kept our three year old and his grandparents out of the cupboard so that none of them could go rummaging for snacks. Unfortunately today marks the day that all of them know how to take the cover off of the handle. So it works well for children who cannot reach the knob and may work for children who give up easily. Our determined little boy has conquered the safety cover.
4,I guess they work,"I actually got these to cover a door knob so that the knob won't keep banging into another wood door damaging it. It worked. I suppose they would also serve the purpose that they were designed for. It's not easy to open the door with them on, but if it prevented a child from falling down steps it would be worth it. They also fall off occasionally."
3,not too sturdy,worked for a while but once the center piece breaks off (quickly) then it doesn't keep a toddler out at all
1,Useless on day 1,"I won't go so far as to say that my toddler figured out the secret to opening a door by squeezing the tabs, but I he figured out how to completely remove the cover from the door the very first time he tried. So, if they stayed on the handle better, they would actually work. He's 2 now but was 22 months at the time.My advice: spring for a better model."
2,No good,Required a much deeper throw than is seen on a typical residential knob these days. I am returning the merchandise.
2,Order only one package to test if they work on your doorknobs,"If they do, buy more. But if they don't, you'll feel silly with 16 doorknob covers lying around.These barely work on our doorknobs, but our doorknobs are slightly oddly shaped. I find the tabs on the sides frustrating to use, but that may be due to the odd doorknob shape as well.The one thing i really don't like about these is that the little tab to cover any locking mechanism has become my toddler's new favorite toy. He'll stand there and play with it for ages. I'm pretty sure that wasn't the point."
4,They do their job,"They are easy to install and do their job. The only problem is that they are a little too big for our knobs. But we are satisfied. We tried the American Red Cross too, and honestly, I prefer Mommy's Helper big time."
5,"It does the job, keeps my 3 year old in the house",This does work. It keeps my 3 year old from getting out. But locking and unlocking the door can be a hassle. And I think after a while he will figure out how to take it off the knob anyway. Worth the price and would recommend but like a lot of these things not perfect. Since he was going outside by himself the extra hassle with these is worth it though. His safety is our biggest priority.
3,Not what I wanted,"It is as advertized, but not what I wanted.The price was fair. Works fine and arrived on time. I'm happy with it.This is extra text to meet the stupid minimum requirements from Amazon."
4,Not sturdy but works well,"These knobs are not as sturdy as I expected, but still work fine. They also come as 2 pieces that snap together. Depending on your view, this is either be helpful (easy to take apart if you get frustrated) or harmful (easy to take apart when the child is old enough). I am okay with this and it has been helpful for guests staying at the house. The grips don't cling as tight as other knobs I've used but said knobs are also more expensive.I mostly bought these because they have the button to cover the door lock - not a necessity but it provides reassurance I wanted. Just be careful the door is not slammed against the wall or door stop - this can cause the button cover to come loose.The biggest con I have against these is that shipping cost me as much as the units I bought! Otherwise, just keep in mind they may not be as big, thick or sturdy as some knobs. But they serve their purpose and I have enjoyed them."
2,Can't find a good set!,"I just can't find a good set of knob covers. The lock access for these is so small you only want to use them if you have a push button lock system on the door, or just a deadbolt. They didn't work for us at all."
2,Prob works for some doors but not ours,"We have standard kwikset doorknobs. These are just too deep. They are a good diameter for a smaller knob but way too deep. The rubber grips are at teh very end of the doorknob so it barely grabs the doorknob and 90% of the time doens't work. Also, you cannot get your two fingers into the hole to turn the lock b/c he lock is prob an inch deep into the cover.We also got another type of doorknob cover (Safety 1st). It is just as deep at this one but the rubber grips that you squeeze are much larger. So it does grab our doorknob. However, it is also impossible to turn the lock and so we cannot use it on any exterior doors.The search continues..."
1,Threw them out,"Depending on the type of doorknob you have, these may be useless. If you have a round, architectural style knob, they're fine. If you have a much more common Kwikset type knob, they're much too difficult for even parents, or kids old enough to use the door properly. If you have the need to put these on a door that will require a key or lock with a turnbutton, think again; they are very deep and you can't get your fingers in the hole on most handsets"
2,Too flimsy,"The plastic is very thin and flexible. The result is that it doesn't take much pressure or strength to pop it apart and remove it completely from the door handle. Might work for toddlers, but I have an 8 year-old autistic girl and these are no match for her. We do have some Safety 1st handle covers that use a much more rigid plastic and they're able to withstand much more pressure and keep her from opening doors and getting into places where she could get hurt."
3,Think I could have found a better one,"The price is right, but is a little difficult at times for me to open the doors, but I guess that even better when you have 2 toddlers running around, so I am not complaining too much, but I do remove it when they are napping lol!"
2,Door knob covers: no challenge for your toddler!,"My son is 2 1/2 and had no trouble ripping these door knob covers right off! Pretty sure a monkey could defeat them. I will say that the actual mechanism for squeezing and turning the knob is good; he can't do that. What he can do, however, is pull the two halves of plastic apart and take the knob cover clean off. But, since these were so inexpensive, I guess I shouldn't have expected too much. A little home engineering and I have gotten them to work for us: duct tape. Taping the cover around the knob keeps it from being popped apart and removed. Now it is securely on the knob, spins when he tries to turn it, and has the little tabs that I can squeeze through the tape and open the door.In short, if you don't mind having to alter the product a little, it can work. But, if you're planning to put them on every door knob in your house, I wouldn't recommend them."
3,not good for oval door handles,"These would probably be great for regulare round door handles, but they keep coming appart on the oval handles in our house. I wish they would stay together..."
1,"Cheaply made, not worth the $$!","This is definitely a case of getting what you paid for! The plastic is really thin and cheap, and took my 2 year old all of 2 minutes to pop the cover right off the door knob. It unsnaps into 2 pieces for easy installation, but unfortunately also makes for easy removal as well. There is a hole in the front of the cover (to allow access to a door lock/key hole) but my kiddo realized he can stick his fingers through the hole and, without having to apply much pressure, easily separate the 2 halves of the cover. I will be investing a couple more bucks into something more durable and not as easy to open."
5,Great asset!,"This is really a good and inexpensive way to make your home child-proof. We don't have to worry anymore, that our toddler is able to lock herself in the bathroom!"
1,My 2 year old figured this lock out in less than an hour.,"I purchased two packs of these locks. They took over a week to arrive with 2 day shipping. Besides the delivery issues we had.. I put them on my ""problem doors"" and found that they did not fit on all but one knob that was perfectly round. I decided to leave them on the doors until i could find replacements as i did not want my daughter digging through my closets for another day... I vry soon found out that they where useless in EVERY way as she promptly removed the cover from the door all together and went rite in! She is only 2 and a half."
2,"These are annoying, but I bet your kid can't turn the knobs with them on.","These worked a little too well at making door knobs hard to open. So well that my husband got frustrated and took them off of the door all together. I may put it back on the basement door when my son starts walking. Or, I'll just buy a gate."
1,Just spend the extra money to buy the ones from walmart,"There are the worst door knob covers ever. I thought I could save a few cents and buy there but I returned them and had to pay for one of them because I threw out the packaging. We cannot open doors with them on because they're so poorly made. I bought them because I lost the ones I bought at Walmart and so I thought to just buy them on-line rather than go out and buy another set. Save yourself the trouble, these are just plain bad."
5,Very Good Product!,"Very easy product to put on. Very sturdy and durable and best of all, no drilling. Adds looks to my 2011 Chevy Silverado Z71."
1,WeatherTech rear mud flaps for 2007 Silverado crew cab,"WeatherTech 120010 Rear Mud Flap - Set of 2. I purchased these based on what the company said about perfect fit on my 2007 Chevy Silverado Crew Cab, turn the clamp with catches the fender, tighten them down and your done. WRONG!! They didnt fit the curvature of the fender, therefore the clamp only grabs thin air. I had to remove the wheels, measure and drill them to fit the fender, and used self tapping screws to install them. They look good, and im sure they will work very well, but 2 hours to get them on, was a bit much. Would I purchase them again? NEVER!! While im at it, know I also purchased the same brand to fit the front. Those took the better part of 2 hours also, and had to remove wheels again. They look great, but they do not fit or install as advertised."
5,Fabulous cookbook for kids,Kids will love it. The whole look and feel of the book is designed to invite kids in and make cooking fun rather than intimidating or complicated. The book is beautifully designed with nice touches like a big spiral binder and heavy pages that allows the book to lie flat and stay open to a certain page... perfect for kids. The recipes are simple and taste great.
5,Good Cooks start young,My eight year old granddaughter has become a big fan of the Food Channel and loves to watch the cooking shows. I decided it was time to get her a first cook book which is written specifically for children. Look and Cook is easy to read and the directions given in the recipes are easy for children to follow. It is a very appealing book to look at It was a good choice.
2,Not very helpful if unable to return home and spend significant time with family,"Don't buy this book unless you're willing and able to return to your family of origin and spend significant time working through your issues there. Half of the book is devoted to doing that work, so if you're looking for something to help you understand family systems theory on your own, this isn't for you."
5,All It's Quacked Up To Be (And More),"This is one of the sweetest, most clever kids' books I've read in a long time -- made especially great by the fact that it is as amusing to me as it is to my 3-year-olds. For them, there are the wonderful illustrations, and the cacophony of animals and their sounds. For me, there is the quirky beauty and rhythm of the language. ""The ferret's just/Fuzz with feet./His nose is a raisin/That sqishes and squeezes./I'd take him home /But I think he'll causes sneezes. Ahchoo Ahchoo Ahchoo!) ..and the thing is, it's just damn funny. In talking about the need to save and value animals of all types, it has a Message, but doesn't hit you over the head...and it's also touching without being cloying. How often can you say that about a kid's book?By the way, I think this book is fine for kids 3 and above. The younger ones may not entirely appreciate the book's subtleties, but they'll love it anyway -- particularly if you're good at replicating the animal sounds."
2,Poor Blues Reference Book,"If a guy whose passion was really rock and roll were to write a book on essential blues, this would be it. All the recommendations are safe rock 'n' roller type picks which aren't bad just inconsistant and incomplete due to unfamiliarity with the genre. The real crime is that essential people are left out like Robert Nighthawk. Buy the AMG Blues Guide instead and make your own top 100."
2,"A bit overly ambitious to claim THE Best of the Blues""","I really appreciated Robert Santelli's ""Big Blues Book"", but his book ""The Best of the Blues - 101 Essential Albums"" leaves much to be desired. I do not profess to be a blues expert, but I have been an avid fan since the mid '50s, have about 200 blues albums and know a bit about the music. The selections in the book are curious if nothing else. For example, there are three albums by Skip James and two by Paul Butterfiled yet there are none by Sleepy John Estes, Robert Nighthawk, Lightnin' Slim, Houston Stackhouse or Lazy Lester. I bought this book expecting (after the great ""Big Blues Book"") to find some albums I am missing from my collection. Not so! All I got was a book expressing an opion that shorts some great blues artists. Unless you are new to blues, I would pass on this book."
1,Scotch tape,"This tape will do the job just like any other, but Scotch tape is the best. I recommend this product."
1,crap,very very tiny tape..totally unusable.what a crap it is.I get it and found it so small then immediately throw it into dustbin.
2,"Good product, price is high","The tape itself is fine, but at over $6, I would expect more total material. In fact, I was able to find this same 3-pack in stores for 1/2 the price."
4,"Works great, no complaints.","I hope you're not looking for a multi-thousand-word review on this one. :-) It's tape, after all. But this brand has worked well on everything I've thrown at it. It sticks wrapping paper well, essentially disappearing into the paper once stuck. But it also sticks stuff to walls well, and in my experience doesn't bring up the paint or leave behind a stick residue when you pull it off. Good produce that does EXACTLY what it's meant to do!"
5,my prefered brand,"Scotch tape is one of my brand preference items. The tape adheres well, is virtually invisible and is easy to use. Great tape for most any paper related job."
5,CLASSIC,You can NOT go wrong with scotch tape. It's a classic. This definitely came in handy on Black Friday when I sat down after shopping and wrapped all my gifts. My fiance was so outdone when he came home and saw gifts already wrapped! :) lol
4,Stick 'em Up,I guess you might say tape is tape is tape but there are varying qualities from the cheap generic to the more expensive name brands like Scotch. Right here around the Holiday Season gift wrapping is certainly something we're doing a lot of so a set of three rolls of tape comes in very handy. This particular tape sticks on flat and clear so as not to obscure your wrapping paper. A definitive advantage over the cheaper tape is that the adhesive is very strong - this tape is not going to pop off the paper as you work on a complex wrap job. Once it is in place it stays. I like that. It pulls from the roll and tears off well on the cutting teeth. Overall it is good quality tape.
3,No much quanity,No much quanity. I didn't even get to wrap all of my Christmas presents with this! Very disapointed that I had to go out and buy more!
3,It's a 3-pack of tape - what's there to say?,"Bought this on a Black Friday weekend Lightning Deal. Found the same price (as the Lightning Deal) at my local Walmart for their everyday price, so guess it wasn't much of a Lightning Deal, but, hey, I didn't have to go out and buy it - just let me mouse clicks do the walking."
2,too little for such high price,"very small amount of tape, target has the same stuff for about $1 each. I would be happy to order again if there was more tape or a lower price."
5,Works as described,"It is difficult for me to get too excited about gift wrapping tape--probably because my wife does all the gift wrapping (unlike me, she is really good at it), and also because when I get a wrapped gift the last thing I look at it is to see what kind of tape was used. However, if you are looking for unobtrusive tape that is easy to use, then this product does work. Not much more to really say about it."
4,Slightly different,"The tape - at first I wondered: ""How can this be different?"". The answer is rather subtle ... the tape has a strong backing with a semi-gloss (satin if you will) finish. For a ""tape collector"" I guess it is slightly between ""magic"" and clear tape.* Not a big deal to me and most people, but hey different strokes for different folks.Also it is considered ""photo safe"" I guess that means it won't yellow over time like tape from the 70s does/has."
4,great for gifts,"This tape works great for gifts because it almost disappears after you put it on to give a nice clean look. The quaily of the actual dispenser has gone down hill over the years probably to save costs or the enviornment. It still works ok, but it is sort of flimsy compared to the good old days. But with that small issue aside I still like the tape and plan to continue using it for years to come."
4,"It's tape, it sticks","Yes, this is good tape. I used it all up for Xmas, wrapping presents. It disappeared well into the paper.However, these 3 rolls could have easily been two, i.e. there wasn't enough tape to constitute 3 rolls. So, if you're thinking about conservation for the planet, this 3-roll pack may not please you. That was a waste of plastic. If you are thinking about your personal, $$ conservation, you will note that this is actually two rolls of the tape we are used to back in the day, now spread over 3 rolls."
5,Gift Wrap Tape,Great price for invisible Scotch Tape; nice to have three in a pack and holders that withstand the use of a four-year old as well as an adult gift wrapper.
5,Good Product,Scotch tape works just as it should and the 3-pack is a good deal especially for all the wrapping that needs done in the Christmas season. :)
3,"Good tape, what there is of it","This tape is designed for wrapping packages, in that it has a flat matte finish that makes it disappear on paper. It's also got all of the characteristics of Scotch Magic tape -- it's strong, flexible, and clean, a pleasure to use, if you're into tape.The only criticism I have is the packaging. These rolls are TINY. There's a small amount of tape on each roll (300 inches as opposed to 500 inches on a standard roll of tape), and you'll notice that they're packaged so you can't see how little tape you're actually getting until you get them home. Sure, there are three of them in the package, but how annoying is it to get to the end of a roll in the middle of wrapping something? Personally, I'll stick to standard-sized rolls of Scotch Magic tape. After all, who really notices the tape on a gift?"
5,Another great product from Scotch,"I have always liked Scotch brand products and this one is no different. I like that you get three rolls of this tape because if you are like me one is never enough when wrapping gifts. I love that the dispenser is easy to use. The tape comes off the roll very easily which is a huge plus in my opinion. I also love that the gift wrap tape is clear when you place in onto the wrapping paper. It makes the gifts a lot more appealing considering that you don't have to look at tape ""lines"". In my opinion the Scotch Gift Wrap Tape is the best tape for wrapping gifts this holiday season.If you want a tape that is easy to use and looks great on your gifts look no further than Scotch Gift Wrap Tape. I do not think that you will be disappointed."
2,The volume is too low.,It is very hard to hear the other party's voice since the volume is simply too low.
2,"OK Phone, Better Choices Available","This Sony phone, like most of the other models they make, works fine but the sound quality is ""flat"" and as a result long conversations tend to be difficult. I find the ergonomics (e.g., no lighted buttons, feel of the buttons, design of the headset) of Sony phones to be a notch or two below AT&T and Panasonic which is surprising because most of their other products are generally pretty good. As a phone in a room where you will not use it too much this is ok, but I'd suggest looking elsewhere for your primary phone."
5,Laughter is the Best Medicine,"In a time when emotion contaminates observation and ideology diminishes humor, it is a pleasure to come across a book with both observation and humor that are paramount. I work as a volunteer in a library in St. Paul and recommend this book to all my readers hoping they will discover laughter. Certainly a few unhappy, bored, curmudgeonly housewives have returned the book to me saying, ""No thinks,"" (in St. Paul accent), but most with more than pea brains get the jokes."
2,Traveling with Scott Haas isn't much fun.,"I just finished this book and came away with only two things. First; Why did I buy this book in the first place and Second; Traveling with Scott Haas must be about as much fun as contracting the black plague. He has all of the warmth of a block of ice. He looks at the people of the world as if they were a nusance. His writing style is about as entertaining as reading the telephone book. I love travel books, but this isn't one that is even close in that genre. It is a book about a sorry excuse for a human being who can not seem to find what life is all about. If your looking for a great book on travel, put down this book and buy something that's really good."
2,Obnoxiously whiny book about conspicious consumption...,"Thank goodness I only borrowed this book from the library, or I'd be mad at myself for throwing away $14! You would think this would be a very useful book right now, given as I'm about to go on vacation with my family of 5 for a week; if not at least useful, I was hoping for funny. NOT! Talk about poor taste. Unless you like reading re-creations of entire conversations where the rest of the authors obnoxious family is whining about the very idea of going to Switzerland (again!), skip this book and spend the time looking over travel websites with your family instead! :/"
5,point of view from a student...,"As a student, I really enjoyed how this book is very detailed, yet to the point, and also the lightness and small size of it. I learned a lot from it, and didn't have a boring time at it either.If there are any teachers out there that are going to be teaching American Goverment - Get this book!! Your students will love you for it!"
2,Was There Even an Effort?,"To sum it up, I'm a huge Shadows fan and if you like some contrived, thrown together bootleg concert footage and road antics then this is your video. Oh, and don't let me forget the very poor audio quality. I popped this DVD in after watching Lamb of God's new Killadelphia DVD which set the bar in my opinion for a brilliantly put together metal DVD, which of course didn't help this DVD's rating at all. Hopefully, Shadows Fall will release the polar opposite of this debacle sometime, we'll see."
2,Disappointing,"Shadows Fall's first DVD contains many songs and a lot of bonus features, but compared to its fellow metalcore band's dvds (killswitch and lamb of God), this dvd is very subpar. First of all, it doesn't feature a single live song from 'The War Within', and the live performances are bootleg. I understand that Shadows Fall didn't want it to be a multi-camera perfect sound quality show, but the decision to have poor quality of video was a mistake. The other footage of the band is funny, but is not nearly as hilarious as it could've been, and doesn't tell us anything about the band or its members personality."
3,Not that good,"I just got this and am watching now, the Video camera is very crappy but I give them cudos to making this DVD . They are a great band and I have bought every one of their albums and been to 2 of their concerts, I went to the last show on the War Within tour and the tour before that. They put on a very good live show. The Century media sampler that comes with the DVD has more good bands on it also. I would recommened this DVD only to hardcore Shadows fall fans as most others would just probably throw it out. It is decent but Needs a lot of improvments on the next dvd. Later."
1,I don't know what to say!,"I'll make this as painless as possible, THIS SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now that I got that out of the way, I am a huge Shadows Fall fan and I was very happy when I heard about this dvd. Now I wish they wouldn't have released one at all. The only cool thing on here is the videos, that's about it. The sound quality is the worst that I have ever heard by far. The live performance is very subpar and filmed at the back of the f-ing club for f***s sake! During the song, it even switches concerts, God this is just bad! I don't know if they are trying to push their fans away or what, but I am sure to never buy another dvd from these guys. The band is awesome and their cds are great so just buy them if you want to hear the magic that is Shadows Fall. There is definately no magic here, just garbage, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!"
2,Terrible,"I was expecting this to be a professional DVD like any normal band would put out, not a collection of bootlegs. Like everyone else, I agree, the DVD is terrible. The sound quality is horrible. The guys act like they're 12 years old. Its not worth buying unless you want a collection of miserable sounding bootlegs."
2,Rent at best,"Do yourself a favor and don't buy this DVD, rent it at most. I love Shadows Fall, I seem them everytime they come to tour, I listen to thier CD's religously, but this DVD... it's a let down to say the least.Go seem the live, skip the DVD."
3,Not an easy read,Not an easy read and very basic information on each person or topic. Maybe good as a reference source to look up a specific person for further research.
4,Don't exercise with this product,"Sleek, with very high-quality sound, this discman provoked envy among my friends. I tend to leave it in groove mode, because I listen mainly to dance music. The only disappointing feature is the so-called skip protection. Whereas a Panasonic I owned could handle being strapped to my body as I exercised on the stairmaster, this one has trouble if I swing my arms energetically as I walk. I guess if you listen to music mainly when you're sedentary on a plane or in a car or tanning on the beach, this should do just fine."
4,The Sin of Presentism,"I enjoy reading Harry Turtledove's alternative histories, and this one was no exception. It's an enjoyable book, and I strongly recommend it. I must, however, point out one flaw that irked me throughout the book. The scenes with George and his commedian friend John in the town wine shops struck me as contrived. The barkeeper acted more like a modern-day comedy club operator than an ancient wine seller, and John's jokes just didn't fit the time period. This is the type of strained writing one would expect to find in an episode of Xena Warrior Princess, but not a Harry Turtledove novel. Despite those distractions--and they are minor--this is still a great book with which to kill an evening."
4,More of the Same,"Sorry Harry but is just like ""Between the Rivers"" but with Christians and left overs from the Greek Panthon of mythical creatures.Now I'm not saying the book isn't enjoyable because it is but there is nothing that you read here that can't be read in any other(much better) Harry Turtledove bookHowever there was one part I just loved and that is why this book gets 4 stars instead of 3. I am refering to the very funny conflict resolution at the end of the story. Great way to handle that little problem!"
2,Leave it and move on.,"If you need something to put yourself to sleep then this book is for you. Three quarters of the book deals with a town under siege and the militia defending it. I might add it deals with it in a very dull manner. A lot of talking between characters, and rather uninteresting conversations they are to boot. Very little in the way of character development, dull plot...blah, blah, blah. This is one you won't regret missing."
5,Gordon C. F. Bearn has changed my life.,"The late Gordon Bearn was one of the 20th century's greatest conributors to this epic tome. Despite there being no references to charts or pictures that support his wild hypotheses, there is a raw organic truth begging to be revealed beneath every word, punctuation mark, and indentation. G. C. F. Bearn, however, quite skillfully dodges any realization of it.All in all, this is a rewarding, albiet agonizing, read. Over many months it has begun to crystalize into cysts of insight that have profoundly affected my philosophical faculties."
5,Great fun and learning for younger children,"I got this for my daughter and the puzzles are great, they are challenging but not impossible, they have shapes on the back to group them accordingly to help with clean up, the little box they come in also helps a lot. my daughter has a great time with them"
5,nice and tidy,I got this for my cousin's son who is 3 years old. He loves to do puzzles and the number of pieces is perfect for his age. The pieces fit together very well and the pictures are bright and vibrant. The box to keep all the pieces in is a great idea - loved by mom's everywhere. :c)
5,Love them!,I bought these for my four year old and he loves them! I bring them out when I'm busy getting things done around the house and he can put them together himself...always making him feel very proud. I like them because there are four compartments in the box for the different pieces and a lid to the box so it stays contained. Definitely a great buy!
5,Melissa & Doug Construction Jigsaw Puzzle,"Bought this for my 4 year old grandson and he loves it. He is a heavy equipment fan but he also is fond of puzzles so this combined the two and made for a good birthday present. 4 seperate puzzles and their own seperate storage box with 4 compartments, plus each puzzle is marked on the back with symbols such as stars, squares, diamonds etc. this way you can seperate them when they get mixed without having to put the whole puzzle together. GOOD IDEA!"
5,3 year old loves this puzzle,"This is an addition to several Melissa & Doug box jigsaw puzzles & toys my grandchildren have.They absolutely love Melissa & Doug toys. The quality is outstanding, it arrived on time and in perfect condition. I always look for Melissa & Doug gifts for my grand children."
4,Good puzzle but...,"The pieces are a little rough around the edges and often need adult hands to pry apart. Also, we received two of the same piece, and one missing piece but since we were leaving for vacation a few days later, my son had to make do.Overall a great puzzle set though."
4,My son enjoys playing with it,"Comes with 4 puzzles of different construction trucks. My son really enjoys putting these together. The case has 4 separate compartments so you can store each puzzle separately. Unfortunately if the cover is on and someone shakes the box around, the pieces will get mixed up despite the barriers. Each puzzle piece has a symbol on the back of it to designate which pieces belong to which puzzle (ie. triangles, circles, squares, etc) so you can make that into a separate game with your child to match the pieces.I like that this puzzle is wooden (not cardboard) so it's easier to my son to put these pieces together and take apart."
3,much smaller than expected,i ordered these for my 3 year old son for christmas. I am sure he will love them they are solid wood and very nice pictures but i was sort of disappointed in the size. If your looking for a bigger puzzle check the demensions before ordering. otherwise very nice puzzles.
4,Black comedy,This book bordered on the surreal due to Sakharov's irony free style. He would describe some craziness involving KGB interference in his life or Soviet life in general and then suddenly break off to describe theoretical quantum physics for three pages. This juxtaposition between the irrational and rational makes the book unexpectedly comic at times.
2,Cantor Shmantor,"I was at the talk of a certain Nobel Prize winner once and he said, half jokingly, that all science is motivated by hatred and envy. This certainly doesn't discount that and is fun to read for what it's worth.I would however like to vent on the two main female characters. They're insultingly the most one-dimensional characters I've read in years. Granted, anyone who reads this book is looking for science anecdotes not general storytelling but I do have my limits"
1,This is the worst book I've ever read.,"The main character fails to be the shallowest I've ever encountered only by virtue of his contrast to the female love interest, a fembot with interest in three (and only three) things: working out, research and screwing male scientists. Seriously, it's the worst book I've ever read, and I've read ""Racing in the Rain."" Awful."
1,is not a DVD is a CD,"is my first bad experience purchase something in amazon the seller send me a CD label with DVD but is not a DVD; Anyway I call amazon & report the mistake from the seller & they give me my money back, thanks God."
1,"Great can, but.......","This is a quality gas can but the picture is NOT the can you will receive. There are 2 different types of handle, metal or plastic. The picture shoes a metal handle which is what I thought I was getting, NOT! The gas can you will get is the newer and CHEAPER type with the plastic handle. I just wanted to let others know about the plastic handle, I am not a big fan of using plastic on a handle that is handling a load. I hope it lasts as long as my metal handled can......"
4,"Very good, with one minor annoyance","At some level, it feels strange to review a gas can; it either works or it doesn't. This one does, and it works pretty well at that. There's one minor design flaw (inherent to all gas cans of this type that I've seen)- you can't fill it without removing the funnel. It's not a big deal to remove the funnel, and it's hardly a major issue, but it seems like a funnel design that didn't require its removal to fill the can would make this very good product even better."
5,Will last a lifetime,"These containers are strong, stable, don't leak, and best of all they last. I have 15 of these. The first ones I purchased in 1977, the most recent, 2012. The design has remained pretty much the same except for the release handle. The older ones had a metal handle that worked fine, but would stick to your skin in sub-zero weather. Painful. The Newer plastic handle is tough at all temperatures (I live in the white mountains of NH) and easy on the hands when you pull on it at 20 below zero.Haven't had a problem with one yet."
4,Eagle UI-50-FS 5 gallon safety can with funnel,"Well-designed can but imperfect construction. Two of the three cans I bought did not seal properly and leaked gasoline fumes on the way home. I discovered that the pour spouts did not line up with the caps and had to bend the spouts. Also removed and reattached the rubber seals which were not properly seated in the caps on all three cans.Wish I had known that the flexible pour spout model works better than the rigid plastic funnel type with cars. Since I have three cans, I can do a two-funnel pour easily enough. Also would like to have an air inlet opening to speed up the pour.Otherwise I'm happy with my purchase."
3,good product,heavy grade metal and no leaks that's what I wanted and it fits the order. It does need a one way vent for pouring fuel out.
2,Can't I just buy a gas can that has a simple screw-off lid?,"I guess not. Every gas can, including this one, has an idiotic contraption that will not stay open instead of a lid. While supposedly helping protect the environment from evaporating gasoline they insure that spills and waste will take place every time you use them. All I do with this one is store gas. When I actually need to pour gasoline into a machine, I use a funnel to transfer gas from this joke of a gas can into a 2 gallon can (made by the same manufacturer) that has a screw off lid that can be taken off and replaced with a short hose. Then I can easily pour the gas into the machine.I love bureaucrats who think they are improving the situation when all they do is make life more difficult.PS - I saw a great vid on YouTube where a guy did relatively simple surgery on a plastic gas can to convert it to something much more useable. Check it out."
2,WARNING: Cannot return this item! Cannot fill at CA gas stations!,"Buyer beware. You cannot return this item to Amazon (due to product restrictions), and in California (our lovely state with the beyond-the-absurd personal safety laws) the tank will not fill due to the ""special"" nozzle gas-emission prevention controls that restrict the gasoline flow into the can because the spout is not compatible. My solution is to try to find an old plastic gas can that I can fill at the gas station even with the newfangled station safety nozzle, and then manually transfer the gas to these tanks for longer term storage using a good old fashioned plastic spout.While the cans are nicely fabricated, I would NOT have purchased these expensive tanks if I had known they could not be filled directly at the gas station. Right now they sit empty in my garage as large metal doorstops."
3,Money well spent,"I have tried the cheaper no spill cans and was never happy with their overall performance. I never had problems with my old style gas can, but now that the no spill cans are here to stay, this one at least works well for filling my lawn mower, etc. It is a little difficult to fill up at the gas pump, but doable."
1,Leaks gas everywhere.,"The gas can leaks gas everywhere. I threw the funnel in the trash. The funnel does not seal to the can, so gas leaks around it. It is a fine can for gas storage, but not for every day use. It is also very hard to put gas in it at the pumps. The spring is very strong. I have a plastic one that works much better for a fraction of the price."
1,Can't put gas from the pump,I can't put gas from the 100 octane pump directly. I read up on it and found a suggestion to try pulling on the black sleeve to trick the pump but it didn't work. Tried to return it less than a month after I bought it but amazon says it's not returnable. Now I have to think twice about buying stuff from amazon.
1,DO NOT BUY THESE CANS,"I bought 4 of these cans in March 2007. They are so bad, I have to throw them away and buy something that works.The problem with these cans is with the plastic funnel. First it's very difficult to install because the clearance between the spring loaded cap and the funnel is too small to allow the funnel to fit. And it's so fat, that you can't empty more than about 1/3 the can into a vehicle's gas tank. The funnel doesn't fit very well, so it ends up leaking gas on the floor under the can, and getting it all over you in the process. The only way to get gas into a vehicle is to buy a gooseneck funnel to stick in the filler pipe, and then pour the gas from these horribly designed cans into the funnel.We're so stupid now, that we can't even design a gas can that works. This so called ""certified safety can"" leaks gas all over the area where it's being used, and takes two people to use.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Safe and sturdy,"Meets all current Federal safety specs and, unlike some of the $15.95 plastic junk at Home Depot that is also Fed. compliant, this one is easy to fill and use. I assume it will last as long as the old Eagle 2.5 gal can I bought in 1973. I still use that one to take waste 2-cycle fuel to the recycling dump."
5,"Johnson City Native Review of ""Let the Record Show""","Being a native of Johnson City, a graduate of Science Hill High School and East Tennessee State University and knowing the city well, this account of the book brought back many memories to me. Age-wise I was between Ms. Fulton and her brother, Charles, whom I knew as a passing acquaintance during high school. Although I didn't know the main characters, I certainly knew of them and was still living in the Johnson City area at the time of this tragedy. Ms. Fulton adheres to the subject in a manner seldom seen in todays literature. I heard of the book through the grapevine and was certainly not disappointed. I commend her for her writing ability. I followed her as an English Major graduate of ETSU and know that I could not approach her ability to put such an account on paper.I want to express my congratulations to her and add my recommendation. I consider this account a must-read for anyone with roots in the Johnson City area during that tragic time."
3,This is not what tour gudie barbie looks like in the movie!!,"Cute barbie.... But tour guide barbie had her pony tail high ,** shorter hair** and a ""teen"" ** look too .BORING!!!! other wise, this doll is no fun!! mattel should remake this doll!! i expected better!!!! and her dress is a little bit darker in the movie. And not so shiny too. Buy it if you want, But be caunctious!!"
2,terrible book,"This book was so full of fabrications I couldn't use it for information in a scholarly article. I can't understand why people who lead extraordinary lives, whether good or bad, feel the need to lie about there past in book form!!"
2,White Wash of An Addict,This book is more entertainment than a factual document. John was an interesting character for sure but hardly hemmed in by the truth. His drug addiction was a major factor in his downfall and kept his audience at bay.
5,more pictures,"The plot was o-kay but I had no idea he led such a fascinating life. I feel so bad for him, he had such talent and drive."
5,A touching story,"This book was a really touching story. Any body who has ever seen one of John's videos will know he had what all men want,but from early on in the book John himself questions whether he was blessed or cursed. After reading this book, and especially the brutally honest chapters concerning him dying from AIDS,it is difficult to believe his legendary endowment was a blessing. This is an interesting autobiography. John is an obviously intelligent and surprisingly modest man, and the story of his ascent and subsequent demise is both candid and compulsive reading."
5,Very informative...shows the not-so-glamorous side of porn,"This book finally tells all in gory and vivid details about the infamous ""Laurel Canyon Murders"", and it finally reveals the not-so-glamorous side of the porn industry; with the drugs, the mafia, the prostitution. For anyone thinking of getting involved in the adult film industry, this is a grisly look at the porno industry. It seems most of the time John Holmes was ""performing"", he was strung out on heroine. It's not all pleasurable times being a porn star. I think I'll keep my job working as a legal secretary."
5,fascintating!,This is a fascinating insight into the last two decades of accounting deregulation and scandals. Brilliant!
3,Is technology moving backwards?,"Cute little lamp - it IS kinda small. Looks nice and all, the base is really flat and the construction seems sturdy enough.... my one question is, ""WHY PUT THE SWITCH ON THE CORD???"" Seriously, it's a desk lamp, so why would I want to go digging around behind or off to the side of my desk to find the in-line switch? Whatever happened to putting the light switch near the lamp-head or on the lamp itself? It seems like they used to be able to do that. I'm not even asking for touch-sensitivity like the last guy. it would be great, but I'd settle for just being able to turn int on and off without getting up."
1,Forget it!,The metal bulb cover gets hot enough to burn you. It lasted 1 year and I have already thrown it out in the trash.
1,"So hot, it melts itself!","This lamp lasted only eight months before the heat from the head of the lamp melted the plastic bracket it was mounted on. The head of the lamp now dangles uselessly by its cord. By the way, the lamp gets so hot that it could burn you if it is on for as few as ten seconds, so there is a safety concern apart from the self-destruction problem. The bulbs are also nearly impossible to find. I do not recommend purchasing this lamp - keep shopping."
4,Good looking but burned two bulbs in two months,"I am not sure where the problem is but it has burned out two bulbs after I bought it in late Sep., maybe the power outlet is not stable, but have paid a little more than the item itself. I still like it anyway, it is beautiful."
5,Superb History. Should Be A Screenplay,"A fast-paced political/military thriller along the lines of Clancy's Clear and Present Danger with the added appeal of being a true story. It is beyond me why no one has turned this into a screenplay. McNamara, Harriman, Johnson, international intrigue, power politics, race relations, crisis planning, mercenaries, rebels, massacres, cannibalism (!), paratroopers, exotic locales, communists...all in one fascinating story. Dragon Rouge is a superbly crafted study of remarkable events. Colonel Wagoner tells the story of the Congo Crisis of 1964-65 in a manner reminiscent of the best of Cornelius Ryan. His writing is at once fast-paced, humorous and insightful. Because of the author's first-rate research, we see these events from multiple perspectives and at multiple levels. Anyone who enjoyed Michael Dobb's highly rated One Minute to Midnight (2008) about the Cuban Missile Crisis will love this book."
4,Hostage Rescue: Not for the Faint Hearted!,"Hostage Rescue: Not for the Faint Hearted!Wagoner's account of the rescue by Belgian paratroopers of European and American hostages at Stanleyville in the Congo in late November 1964 reveals the complex political, diplomatic, and propaganda dimensions of a special operation, leading to the equally controversial cancellation of ""Phase II"" of the rescue, thus abandoning hundreds of other hostages to torture and murder in outlying areas. Overall, I have found this book to be highly readable and although the material is dated it is still historically significant in the study of modern special warfare. I believe that this title will appeal to the professional and armchair military historian and serving military personnel."
4,"A short show, but full of surprises.","This show isn't as long as the Forum show or the second Katowice disc but it holds a few surprises of its own, especially the appearance of ""MFC"" as an opener. This is the first rocking opener played on the tour and quite rare for a band that tends to kick off sets with a mellow song. Other highlights are ""Lukin,"" with Ed barking the lyrics, and an extended Improv before the main set closer ""RVM."" ""STBC"" and ""Leaving Here,"" are stand-outs from the encore. Overall an interesting set list from a shorter than average show."
4,Good buy for heartland rock fans,"Joe Cerisano has been called ""the most famous anonymous singer in America"". He's done commercials for the Army and Navy as well as Pepsi, Mountain Dew etc and worked with a huge variety of artists. He has a very recognizable voice and this album will be enjoyed by anyone who is a fan of 1980's AoR or heartland rock. For the longest time I thought this album was only available on vinyl, but it's here and on CD! Grab it! John Cafferty comes to mind as another similar artist."
4,The Piners,"If you enjoy soothing harmonies,this album is just the ticket. When I first listened to the cd, I couldn't believe that I had not heard of this band before. The sounds are very reminiscent of some of the best blues and folk artists around.This is a great cd, everyone who has heard it just loves it!"
4,ive never been much for emo,"i heard denver harbor were an amalgam of nofx (of whom i strongly resent) but i heard ""satisfied"" on tv one day and saw the cd cheap and got it.VERY good call.this is catchy emo modern rock at top notch.i love the vocals too.very driving and catchy.if you dig bands like letter kills,anberlin,and the exies you will definitely dig this album."
4,Thankful,I am thankful that Will Salazar didnt quit music after the disaster that happened in Fenix Tx. He used a few songs from what was going to be the third Fenix Tx album and put them on here. This album reminds me a lot of Lechuza which was probably one of the best albums of 2001. Their first album was ok but it sounded too much like Blink 182. I'm glad it didnt take them 5 or 6 albums to figure out that you can't gain any self- respect playing to ten year olds.This album has that Lechuza mature sound and basically is an extension of it. I've read some reviews on here and i guess if you're 10 year old Avril Levine and Yellowcard must seem like AC/DC. Sorry kids you won't like this album.
5,Love to design by this album,It just doesn't stop. Being a graphic designer i am up a lot at night doing design and in order to stay awake I listen to this. It gets the blood flowin and is just great music. Highly Recommended
3,Not their Best Effort,"At best, a great setlist bogged down by a seriously sloppy effort. You might want to skip this one. There are several superb European performances, including Verona, Milan, Katowice II, and Cardiff. However, I guess it all boils down to personal preference. What the heck, a mediocre Pearl Jam show still smashes most of the music out there (raise me a star)!!"
4,Jams in England,"Warning, if you are only buying one of the live Pearl Jam sets, don't make it this one. That being said, this is a very good, cd, but not one of the best. The song list leaves something to be desired, however the band sounds particulary sharp, and turns several songs into 8 minute jams, which is suprising given thier recent sounds in Yeild and Binaural. If you are looking to add a differant sound of Pearl Jam to your collection, buy. If not, look elsewhere."
5,Love It or Hate It,"This entry from the European Bootleg Series is a real polarizer. People either seem to love it or hate it, which is easy to understand. The show has a caustic, rough edge to it that can be interpreted as sloppiness, etc. There are miscues by the baker's half dozen, but the crowd loves it. The tension and excitement carries into the music; you get the feeling that at any moment Stone Gossard's guitar is going to explode into shrapnel. I think it's great, and I wish I could have been there. 5 stars."
5,Plastic better than wood.,"We have a crayola 2-sided easel like this one. I like the positive locking crossbar, inaccessible hinges, rounded edges, light weight, and soft plastic (compared to wood). It's hard for a kid to hurt himself with this toy. We bought it at We B Toys, and supplied thick dry erase markers from an office supplies store."
5,A perfect art easel,"If you are looking for an art easel for your kids, look no further. Step 2 makes another winner. We couldn't be more pleased with our purchase. First plus, it's put together in seconds. No tools needed. Just slip the tray into place and snap in. Second plus, it can be popped back out and folded up and put away just as quickly. Both boards wipe clean without any trouble. My son is four and this is at the perfect height for him. The clips that hold paper do seem a little flimsy but the over all quality of the toy is very good.My only other complaint is the letters and number magnets. They are nothing special. Like from the dollar store. There is also not real place to put them when you want to use that part of the easel and not have them get lost. But my son seems to be more into drawing on it then using them anyhow. There are many easels out there but I think this is a great one to buy. Great value for the money."
5,This is the hot spot of my house!,"My girls love to color but, the little one, 22 months loves to color ANYTHING. When we recieved this in the mail she went right to it. She has colored all over it and I have been able to wash it all right off. I have paper in the big clips on both sides that she is not able to pull off while she is coloring. This has become the favored spot in the house for my girls and even my oldest, 11, likes to help his sisters make cool things. I got it so my 22 month old and my littlest 3 months would eventually both be able to use it at the same time. I never thought my older two would like it as well! It is very sturdy and the tray in the middle is great for holding crayons. We did not keep the little magnets because they are not as safe as I think they should be for this age. I also love the fact that I can fold it down to move it and put it in the closet when needed. Great product!"
4,Easel,Very easy to set up and it was everything I had hoped it would be. My two year old grandson has enjoyed it. The only problem I have found is in the magnetic letters. The small magnets fall out very easily. Annoying.
4,A Good toy for little artists,"My little artists truly enjoy this toy. It is great because it has two-sides, so my 15 month old son and my nearly 3 year old daughter can both play at the same time. (I'd do just about anything to avoid temper tantrums over a great toy). Another plus is that it folds up and stores quite nicely. The clips at the top work extremely well to hold up any paper that my children want to color or paint (I only wish that my son was a little taller so that he could reach the paper better when it is clipped to the easel - but he will grow). The shelf underneath between the two easels is fabulous for holding any of their art supplies and helps them keep their things within an arms reach. I agree with the other reviewers, the small magnets in the letters and numbers fall out easily and are choking hazards. I have put all of the letters and numbers away and now my children can concentrate on the artistic side(s) of the toy."
5,Very good film - my family enjoyed it!,"We saw this film last night on USA and it was cool. Had some great moments and made us laugh. The entire cast was great and really brought everyone together. We need to see more great films like this. Like the lady said previously it gives me hope when i see a film like this. Lots of talented people coming together, bringing the races together. I really enjoyed this film. I hope more people see it. And my props to Amazon for this review service. it makes people get to play reviewer! Thanks!"
5,Quite impressive! Margaret Cho steals the film!,A great film exploring personal identity in culture and class. Dante basco does a wonderful job in his portrayal of an Asian boy who was adopted and raised in a Black family. Great development of characters and of the relationships between the characters.Margaret Cho steals the show with her role as an exchange student who has been accidentally dropped off at the wrong host family but learns to soak up the culture throughout the movie. Now you KNOW that's gonna be hilarious!Check out this movie. It's really good. The storyline moves smoothly and the acting is great in this multi-racial film. Pam Grier is excellent as the matriarch in the film.
4,Hilarious,"This is a very funny film, but with some serious undertones.Why is it only available DVD? Now I know why I haven't been able tofind it in the VHS section of my local video store. It has a lot to say about the Asian and African American encounter in L.A. Anyone who lives here, will die laughing at this film."
3,"Annoying crowd, poor sound quality","I just recently started collecting the pj bootleg series, and this one is the worst one I got so far. First, the sound quality is much worse than some of the other ones I have (seattle2, boston2), the audience noise is very grainy sounding. Also, the crowd is pretty annoying, they do these weird chants (sounds like ""alive"") throughout the concert between songs. The performances in general sound very lack luster. On the other hand, this is the only one of the series that has all four big pj songs from the first album: alive, even flow, black, and jeremy."
3,Not recommended,I would not recommend this because although it dried my hair fast my hair didn't get as straight as my old blowdryer which was over 5 years old
1,Not very powerful - only lasted a year,I bought this dryer based on the revlon dryer a friend of mine had. It was not the same. This dryer is very weak at blowing my thick hair. After about a year it blew up in my hand and the case on the outside cracked. I recently bought the Conair infiniti pro and I absolutely love it.
3,One man's restrained is another's tepid...,"There is nothing intrinsically wrong or unsuitable about this authentic arrangement by Beethoven of the Violin Concerto for piano, but not far in, I found myself thinking more about the torpidity of the playing than questions of suitability. I am used to more sparkling versions of the original such as those by Krebbers and Haitink, and found this one decidedly soporific. The Philharmonia are subdued and happy to be prodded by conductor Sir Alexander Gibson into providing an innocuous accompaniment as pianist Pietro Spada tinkles away - but surely Beethoven is much more than this. This is inoffensive music-making of the kind all too familiar to the modern concert-goer. The fillers are equally unusual and equally uneventful; neither is especially inspired. Obviously there is rarity interest in this enterprising programme and it is not as if the music is poorly played - far from it - it's just that I can find no particular reason to listen to it."
5,Colorful Review,"Excellent book, great resource for the train lover. Lots and lots of high-quality photos, good text. Highly recommend."
1,NEVER PLAY THIS GAME,"This game is soooooooooooooo bad , the worst game i played . on the first level you know it stinks. A bad game of a good moovie"
1,Very buggy and incomplete,"Pointless quests with no real conclusions. CTD every 30-45 minutes. Lengthy dialoge with no real human attachment. All in all a VERY unpolished product, even with the patch. If your favorite aspect of the first game was the story then do not buy this game."
1,Dead End buggy mess,"This game never worked properly, and their forums for fixes was nine miles long. The first game was fabulous, and this had a lot of promise, but fell short in the fact that it was released buggy, and then didn't have the momentum to force proper updates. A game that makes me work that hard to find fixes for this video card or that motherboard, well, it only gets 1 star. Sorry KoTOR2:TSL, you're no KoTOR."
2,What happened to the ending?,"It all started so well, the improvements on KOTOR were welcomed and useful but the whole series has been let down by dead end quests and massive plot holes. By all accounts Lucasarts pressured Obsidian into an early release and it shows. Whilst some planets and quest are fun and challenging, other areas of the game seem to be afterthoughts and the ending itself is abrupt to say the least. The game is good enough but it could have been so much better. There is talk of Obsidian releasing a patch to finish the 'iffy' parts and all I can say is I hope they do.All in all: not as great as the original but still enjoyable until the end."
2,This game has lots of bugs and an incomplete story.,"The gameplay would be great if it weren't for the bugs. Also the story is incomplete so you get a quantem leap to the ending where you get to go, I paid money for THIS?!!They also took out a force powers that all classes used to have. Only Jedi Guardians and their Sith counterpart have force jump.Note: there are 50 character levels in this game, the most you might ever reach is level 30. Lucas Arts cut out around 40% of the game."
1,poor forsight,"I purchased this game in may of 2009. My computer is about a year old and runs very high quality internals to allow for maximum gaming. This game will install but not play. it freezes at the main menu and shuts down. When contacted, lucasarts (via Yoda's help desk) simply stated that I have too good of a video card and thats too bad. I searched high and low for updates and drivers, but the game simply wont support a card newer than 3 years old. if your card isnt the on listed on the game reqs DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. you will lose your money like I did. The same is true of other lucasarts games such as Jedi Knight and Jedi Outcast so beware."
2,A true disapointment,"While its true that there were some improvments in the game, it was shipped in a unfinished state. Its plauged with bugs, so many that its difficult to play to the end. I would not buy this game, the storyline is ok, but its not worth the frustration you will face."
2,An unfinished game,"Simply put, this game was published before it was completed. It has no ending, no conclusion. It reaches a climax and stops. Then there is a short cinematic that makes utterly no sense in the context of the events leading up to it. There are many plot lines and quests that cannot be completed because the endings were cut. There are a few that you discover yourself in the middle of and have no idea what's going on because the beginning was cut. The entire last 1/3 of this game leaves you feeling as if you have been slapped and do not know why. You have. By Lucas Arts, who were so determined to release this game by christmas they did not care if it was ready or not. It was not. My advice is, wait and see if they fix this game. If they do not, save your money."
1,A huge disappointment for the fans,"The game is truly unsatisfying, bugged and incomplete. Just one of the many unfinished products; those are so common nowadays."
4,"Good, solid game","The gameplay is well done. This is a real-time, turn-based rpg that is set in the Star Wars Universe. You play a jedi who fights bad guys. You get to choose your force powers as your level up and choose which attributes (strength, speed, etc.) to level up. A very D&D-style; star wars RPG that is fun to play and plays well.I am using Windows XP. I don't know how well it will play on newer OSs. Totally worth the used price I paid (which wasn't much)."
2,Blind alley bugs - ruin game experience.,"I just have to get this off my chest.... I've never played a game with so many blind alley bugs, ones that you continue playing for an hour before you realise your in a bug that you can't get out of and have to go to a previous save... hoping you don't trigger the same bug!@?*& This is unacceptable, I'm sort of ok with a bug that craches my system, but this, I'm actually going to stop playing in the middle of this game (haven't done that sience I made the mistake of buying MOO3)."
3,The first game was better...,"The problem with this game is story... there isn't one. While the first game was a lot of fun with a great plot line, this game doesn't seem to really take you anywhere. This game has the same game play as the first(which I think is great), but the story is awful and incomplete (not to mention all the bugs and flaws I encountered). Play the first one and don't bother with this game."
2,Where did I come from?,"When you start off playing the game, your in your ship half dead, then your droid pilots the ship into the Peragus mineing facility. When you awaken you meet a women named Krea.....But what I don't understand is where did I come from? In the original Knights of the Old Repuplic when you beat the game you become the new sith lord (if you beat it on the evil side) or the savior of the galaxy (if you beat it on the good side).Thats what really made me upset about this game I wanted to continue not start over again. I'm not saying this game wasn't fun, because it was fun, it just didn't follow the original story. This is a game that you could play before playing the first one."
2,Great Potential awfull execution,The story for this is just incomplete and has many things such as(look away spoilers included)you can nagotiate evily for a discount from a guy's robot but...the guy sells nothing......and assasin droids never get stopedmany more
1,We were unable to run game on Windows 7,We were unable to run the game on Windows 7 despite having the XP compatability mode. What should have been hours of gametime turn into hours of wading through on-line advice gibberish. The game is no longer supported by the manufacturer so they were no help. Severely disappointed.
1,Don't buy this!!!!!! (For PC atleast) Unless you have Windows XP,"I have windows 7 and it doesn't work. It just crashes as soon as you play it. Infact, this game has ruined my computer. I'm not sure why but now everytime I use my computer it's super slow and it started happening when I played this game. Coincidence?"
4,I had fun with it,I had a lot of fun playing this game at my friends house. It is fun to make 2 games and one dark and one light. I love all the force powers there r so many. I think u will have a lot of fun with this game. It also gives u tons of replay value.
2,It sure looks compelling but.......,"I could not get this game to run on my (state of the art)system. The software is filled with bugs. The story certainly looks compelling and I loved the first game. It is a real shame I won't enjoy this one. I gave it 2 stars, as I understand some people have been able to play it. My advice is wait for the patch."
3,guardedreply,"Software did not perform as expected. This may be due to an incompatibility with hardware, or the merchandize may be flawed. Delivery was in accordance with published estimates, the product appeared to be free of any physical defects, and the source of the problem remains unidentified. I am willing to give the vendor the benefit of the doubt, and ascribe performance problems to system compatibility."
2,Is that it?,"Well yes... Two thirds of the game are playable...and fun... But what hapenned with the last third? Is there something missing? Something rushed? This game is half shorter than the first Knights Of The Old Republic! This could have been a great game if the missing content had been added... Lots of quests unfinished, lots of worlds disappeared... Is that all? I bought the game because I am a huge fan of the first one... I expected a sequel greater than the first game but when I finished the game I couldn't believe that it had ended... So short... So disappointing... If you are a huge fan of the first game you'll definitely be very disappointed by this one... A lot of ideas were good... The main story was quite nice but the worlds you visit are a lot smaller, the quests are incomplete... It's not worth its price..."
2,Incomplete in everyway,"1/2 The quests arent complete for this game. Very buggy. More plot holes that swiss cheese.You can tell it was rushed....if you want to know what this game was missing, all you have to do is look at Obsidians forums. To bad as had potential to be better than the first.Most disappointing was the ending...or lack of...well unless you count the credits screen as an ending to an epic adventure after 35+ hours...."
4,Goood game but needs improvements,when i got this game it didnt really work but i downloaded two patches and it worked great although a trouble with loading its still fun and i do recommend that if u get the game for pc to get the patches
4,SWKOTOR II,"Game play is just like the first...almost plays like a content addition. However the interface is a little buggy. Mostly annoyances rather than anything catastrophic, like mis-alignments with the pointer and menu items. Worth every penny if you want more of the same as delivered in SWKOTOR I, like I did."
3,Not like KOTOR1,"This is a good game. It's not as good as Kotor I. The workbench improvements are great, but I felt that the gameplay and storyline was too controlled and forced along. I installed the ""The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod"" before playing this, so I didn't encounter very many of the more horrible plot holes."
4,"4 out of 5 stars because if they had put some thought into it, this game would have won an award like the first one.","I REALLY like the game, but the first one was much better written. Some of the storyline was a little disapointing, it seems like they were in too much of a hurry to get the game out than to think it out and finish the storyline, but still lots of fun - wether you're light - OR - dark side."
4,Great,"some technical issues, but overall a deep well thoughtout game. While fun, the game does follow the first game perhaps too closely."
4,This Game is pretty sweet.,This game is pretty sweet. The first one had a better storyline and the responses of the characters changed more often. The NPC's in this game say the same things throughout the entire game.
1,never worked,"I tried this game on 2 laptops and 1 PC. It didn't work. I even got a replacement and it still didn't work. Do not waste your time and money on this product unless you have a lot of Video RAM, and space."
1,Not worth the disks it's burned onto,"Lengthy gameplay but ultimately unrewarding due to large plot holes, frustratingly unresolved storylines, and legions of bugs that hinder gameplay!No where near as good as the 1st game"
1,doesn't strat because of impossible to get new drivers,When we emailed Lucas Arts they said your drivers are out of date but there are no updates for an ATI radeon 9200. So I can't play till it's changed to something that is supported and when I clickame it does nothing at all.
3,"Such promise, such loss...","This game is good fun, but seeing all the loose ends definitely detracts from the overall game experience. Many facets of the story were cut, and this resulted in even more cuts towards the end of the game when parts of the game dependent on those earlier facets showed up. What we have now is a shortened, trunctuated version of what should have been.However, I found the overall story to be more meaningful and less of the standard ""You may only be Jedi or Sith"" fare seen in many places. This game touches on the failings of both those who pursue power and those who hold it gently. When the mods which restore much of the cut content are released, this game will make a comeback on my computer.Overall, I'd say it's a good game which will likely become better and better as fans seek to revive it."
3,no difference,"I got this game expecting a part 2 meaning a recreated version. its the same freaking game i swear the only difference is like the first room you wake up in, it was disappointing it was just a easy way for star wars to make money off the reputation off the first game."
2,:(,I played the first game and absolutely loved it! I was really bummed out when I purchased this game and discovered that I wouldn't be able to play it because it only works on XP PCs and not Vistas! I did get to play the beginning of the game on another computer for a while and the story seemed similar and wasn't incredibly exciting... it was a really slow start.
1,sucks. this is completely waste of money.,"sucks. graphics,story line and game system are all sucks. this is completely waste of money. also have a lot of bug. i reccomend if you want to get stressed instead of enjoying star wars world."
4,Awesome but bug-laden,"This is an awesome game so far--very compelling characters, good graphics, good combat, great environments, even better music. The storyline, or ""point of the game"" is not as clear or motivating as the first one: ie, I'm asking myself ""why should I care about doing this?"" but the character development is good.I am experiencing the desk-top crash problem. I had seen several top-reviwers (IGN, GameSpy, GameSpot, etc.) mention this particular problem, so I'm assuming it's not just a problem with my computer, which ran the first one, and most other software, just fine. I recommend getting this in spite of the bug, if not for the sheer entertainment level, but because the problems it has will likely be fixed in an upcoming patch (if they come out with one...)."
2,EEEKS...Point and Click.....Yawn!!!!,"Such great visuals and I love most of the Star Wars RPG/Shooters, BUT, I cant believe this is a point and click game. I was hoping KOTOR2 would have implimented a normal battle engagement. Theres nothing worse than toggling thru menus etc during an intense battle and actually having to turn around, click the target, then engage someone else after the kill. The days of Boulder's Gate point-n-click should be over, but I guess theres a crowd for this type of gameplay. Still a good game, but dissapointed."
1,Get a patch already,"Until LucasArts get an updated patch out for this game... it is definatley not worth buying. Way too many issues, glitches, and bugs. Fun game... but it needs a patch to work out its issues"
1,Short and sweet like poo,"^^ That is how I describe my experience with this game as it crashes due to the problem with ATI cards. I gave the fun a one because I wouldn't know how fun it is.To get to the point, only buy this game if you have an nvidia gpu series 5 and on. Otherwise, you will not be able to play it... Seriously. Go and read other peoples reviews."
1,A sense much of the darkside in this game...,"well, lets start with the basics. first of all, you start no weapons and you are stuck in some building and locked inside it. then what do you do? I never got past the first stupid lvl. it just wasted me a great 30 minutes. the controlling is horrible and i have one thing to say...THIS GAME IS A PATH TO THE DARKSIDE!!!!No offense to those who could pass the first lvl. i hav failed"
4,Good old times,I played KOTOR a long time ago and decided to catch up on KOTOR2 for old time sake. I ordered the item new and it arrived pretty swiftly. Just make sure to patch it and add the extra music and video patches as well for added improvements.
2,Star Wars:knights of the Old Republic II,"Even with the patches installed this game did NOT work very well with windows 7. For those who played the first KOTOR this game plays almost identical to the first, although the story is not as good as the first."
1,"Cut Content, Buggy Game","Lucasarts forced the release of this early for the $.Things were cut like a WHOLE planet not to mention the cutscenes are buggy and it crashes every 30 minutes.I was so flusterated I had to cheat to continue the storyline, legitimate playing could not advance me further, and this WASN'T because I couldn't handle the gameplay no.... this is because the game is so bugged!But beside the game failing half the time, stuff disappearing out of my inventory... the interaction between npc's was ok. However sometimes things did not make sense, you are left wondering why this person talked to you out of the blue about nothing.My biggest erk is the cut content for the 3rd KOTOR.Cut content, yes.... and they didn't think the fans would know or get mad about this? Cut stuff from the game?Don't buy this unless they patch this thing then it might be worth it. Buy it now and you'll regret you did."
1,SW KotOR II Not Ready for Playing,"I have KotOR I (PC) and all patches. Game of the Year - 2003 and maybe the best game in the last 5 years. I bought KotOR II (PC) on Feb 8 2005. Finished it March 9 2005. I had most if not all the problems mentioned previously by other reviewers from the forums and here. KotOR II was supposed to be the ""long awaited sequel to the 2003 Game of the Year"". It was ""awaited"" and KotOR I was, is and always will be the 2003 Game of the Year. KotOR II needs a ""fix"" patch. It also needs a ""content"" patch. It may get the first; but I highly doubt the second. Only buy the game when the ""fix"" patch is available. DO NOT pay more that $25 for the game as is. Nearly every reviewer (XBox and PC) who has played KotOR II completely has written similar things: Bugs, Cut Content, Missing Quest, etc. WE ARE NOT WRONG!!! LucasArts and Obsidian ""screwed up"". We will be less likely to buy KotOR III. There will be a KotOR III. (Platinum rule: S/He who has the platinum, Rules.)"
1,Ray said it best -- Buyer Beware!!,"This game installed on my computer just fine. Then after the first movie played the game crashed. I loaded and tried playing the game 3 more times, it crashed in the same place each time. I have a top of the line computer which plays DOOM3 flawlessly. I want to take this POS back to the store and get my money back, but I can't.Go ahead and purchase this game, but only if you feel lucky."
4,One of the Better SW Games,"I enjoyed playing KOTOR2 but if your computer is fairly recent you will have to download old drivers and replace a specific file in the game folder to get it to work. The information is available on the KOTOR2 forums. The game plays exactly like the first one, just with a different story. You either have a much higher level cap or maybe there is no cap, but either way you get to choose allot more force powers. Fun game, just be prepared to dive into the technical side of the programming part to get it to work. I had to get someone else to do it for me as I am not a technical guy."
2,Unfinished Game,"Imagine you're watching A New Hope. Luke and the gang are rescuing Leia from the Death Star, it's very dramatic, immensely exciting, Luke and Leia leap across the broken bridge and land safely on the other side. Then the movie ends.That's essentially this game, and I was horribly disappointed by it. The ending is simply not there. Dozens of hours of engrossing and fun gameplay culminate in what is possibly the worst ending of any game I have ever played. It's not that the ending is just bad, it's not even there. The fact that this game was released at all is an argument for changing the laws in this country to allow for software to be returned for refunds.If you buy this game, be prepared to be disappointed at the end."
1,So useless for ATI card owners,"I should have read the posts before I bought the game. I played and enjoyed the first game very much. I have a very fast computer with ATI 9800XT and, as others before correctly reported, the game crashes during or right after character creation. Worse yet, emails to customer support are ignored. Funny, how there have been no other problems with other games -- this company simply cannot be trusted."
1,Game Installs But Does Not Run,"I'm running a fairly new machine (dual core 2.16 GHz. processors; 2 GB Ram, nVidia GeForce 7600 card, etc.) and I have never had any trouble running any PC-games...until this one. It installs, seems to start, and then I get one of those ""Program has stopped working"" send an ""error report"" to Microsoft alert boxes. I checked the -- 15 mile long -- tech support forums, downloaded patches, emailed Lucas Arts. Nothing works.It is fraud that they are still allowed to sell and market this game. Do not buy it. Do not waste your money.All the more pity because the original Knights of the Old Republic was a seminal game."
5,It's good if your computer has the right specs,When I got the game I installed it and the game told me that I had exceeded all of the recommended system requirements. Well when it came to play the game the graphics were all messed up and the game constantly froze. So I went to Google and found out that i needed a patch for it to work better needless to say i did that. Well after adding the patch the problems got a little better but it still freezes and I have to restart my computer after every freeze so i can continue. Haven't played it in over a month so I would say that I wasted $20 on something that isn't good enough for my comp.
3,Star Wars,"This was actually a gift for a family member. I'm not hearing any complaints, so he must like it all right! :)"
3,Decent sequel which does a few things better than the predecessor,"This game is a mixed bag. I enjoyed the game but it lacks the incredible story and star wars music that the first one had. However, the annoying level cap that the first one had is exceptionally higher than the original. Obsidian made this one and Bioware made the first. Bioware has a problem with making level caps and evening out gameplay but I digress. This is a decent entry into KOTR story. However, an annoyance is that the story intersects near the end regardless of your choices. This doesn't make any sense and is a letdown. However, you truly feel like a powerful figure as a jedi which wasn't the case in the first one."
1,Buggest game ever,"Thanks Lucas, thanks for rushing Obsidian, thanks for the bugs, thanks for the worst customer support ever seen, thanks for the most rushed game final ever seen, thanks for the buggest game ever seen, thanks for delay on the patch."
1,is lucasarts/obsidian running their final tests onthepublic?,"this game at present is in terrible shape. my character has things coming out of his head. also for some reason the camera spins wildly around my character at some times. it appears to be the same engine that powered kotor because it definitely isn't any better looking...so why the problems? lucasarts says low-end video cards are responsible for these errors...sorry guys. my comp is: 2.8 ht p4, 1gig ram, 9800 128mb ati radeon. this game should run fine, especially since it isn't anything comparable to high-end games (in looks) like doom3 or half-life 2, which both ran great on my comp. fix it lucasarts/obsidian! i wouldn't recommend buying this game until these major bugs are fixed. wait a couple of months till they release the real game. avoid!!!!"
3,A Great Game and a Great Letdown,"This game is clearly a sequel. But as a sequel to a truly amazing game, I expected it to be good. And it was, briefly.The gameplay is basically the same as the original KotOR, with a few new additions. There were new forcepowers, new feats, and the fancy new influence system. Depending on your actions, party members will be more or less influenced by you, and can become evil, or good. Also, as the 'last of the Jedi' through your actions, you can train party members to become Jedi as well.The huge disappointment is in the plot. It starts out alright, but just cuts off. It seems as if they didn't finish the game in time, and just to get it onto the shelves, they half-assed the very end of the game. It is a great letdown to what could have been a great game."
2,LA Screws up again,This game had too much potential to be one of the best games released in a while. But Lucusarts just had to put their two cents in and too much content was lost in the aftermath.Judge for yourself here: http://forums.obsidianent.com/index.php?showtopic=29764LA should stop armchair developing and actualy let the game makers finish a product before it is released.
3,All that could have been,"It's sad that they didn't get to finish the game. I'm not sure if the game has been patched, if it has then I say it's worth being picked up. This was to be the next step in the series to really bring in the people.The overall game is unforgivably buggy. Though all the little tweaks to the game like what they did with the lightsabers was a great improvement, also how you gained influence was a large step forward.With all that said, you should not ship a game when there is a way to make the game un-winnable. So what I am saying is, it's a great concept which was in my opinion a good step forward, just not enough to pick up if they have not patched the game."
4,Not Bad but the First One is Better,This game has the same basic gameplay as the first KotOR but I feel the story was better in the first one. This is still a great game though and if you enjoyed the first one you will like this one as well.
5,awessome,this is a great star wars game i am a huge star wars fan and would reccomend this game to everyone
4,A good game,"Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords is a very good game. I had previously played it on the Xbox and liked it then. I had a little difficulty getting it to run on my Windows Vista operating system but with the compatability mode engaged for Windows XP and 2000, it worked. The game itself ties in well enough to the story of the original Knights of the Old Republic. It would have been nice for the story to tell us more about what happened with Revan after the end of the first game but we only catch glimpses. The story follows one of Revan's Jedi Generals that was exiled from the Order after the Madalorian Wars and can be a story of redemption (light side) or apparently follow the path of Revan on the Dark Side."
5,"House of Pain, ""Jump Around"" used CD review","I purchased this used CD on a Friday eve and the CD arrived inmy mailbox that Monday!! That is fast service, not to mentionthe product came in excellent shape, exactly as described if notbetter. I am a VERY satisfied customer and use Amazon a lot whenwhen I want something right away & in good condition !!"
5,Travel made easy,We travel alot and this has helped our daughter bring a piece of home with her...she loves it. Especially pleased that it was available with an African-American Barbie on the case.
3,i would just like 2 say,that this item is avalible inafrican american.if u have aproblem finding it try lookingfor a list of all barbie casesand it should show u it. :)because it is listed as itsown seperate item.
5,Cultural Sensitivity,I would like to see a brown face made available for this item. Children like to identify with their dolls. The applique on the outside of the item indicates the contents inside and the identity of the user. Several ethnicities should be available to be adhered to the outside of the case. It would definitely boost sales of the item in communities of color in the world. We are not purchasing because currently it is only available as displayed.
4,Sensitivity to Cultural Diversity,"I have opted not to purchase the carrying case due to the fact that it is not available in multiple ethinicities. I have and will continue to purchase Barbie items online. However, I have noted that this item is not manufactured for African Americans or other cultural backgrounds. Most Barbie items are available in numerous ethinicities, but this is an exception. I would like to see this offered similar to other products. I think it would definitely boost the sale of this item. Every little girl needs a carrying case to take her little Barbie gear to her Grandparents or for a sleep over with friends."
1,Great concept,"This was a great concept. However, the barbies fit in awkardly and we have a problem getting them to stay. There is only one accessories drawer-definitely not enough. The case is very hard to open and shut. At least it rolls well."
4,Not Bad,My daughter wanted this case and she loves to pull it around. But it doesn't hold the Barbie's in well and it keeps coming apart. It is fixable with a wrench. Overall its a good toy.
4,I wish it was better constructed.,"First of all, it is difficult for a 5-yr old to put the Barbies in just right. It is difficult to close properly as well. The carrying handle is clever, and I thought it was a great idea, but the hinge is weak and broke with the first attempt to close. We were able to fix it, but it only broke again a month later and I can't get it back together this time. It was a waste of $(dollar amount), but the idea was a good one."
3,Great Storage Case!,I bought this case and it is wonderful. It has enough room to hold all my daughter's Barbie dolls... she takes it with her (nice and neatly)to daycare every day. Convenient.. and she really loves putting her dolls and things in there. I have to go get another!
4,good for beginners,Qreat for quick review or fast for quick questions.I had fast shipping and the book itself was in great shape. Just was not the right book. But I used it anyways and still have it with my others.
3,Difficult to follow,"This book is so condensed that you have to be pretty smart to pick up on the inferences that the authors make. I wish I had found a different book to help me refresh before I started Managerial Accounting.Update: After having finished Managerial Accounting, I have realized that this book covered BOTH Financial and Managerial accounting. That would explain why I was so lost. I've changed the rating from 2 to 3 because the product page should have pointed out that principles of accounting does not just mean ""financial"" (which the average student would likely assume)."
5,The song is upbeat and a great love song!,"Awesome, it will stay in your head for days and will cause you to think about alot. As far as know, this song is a remake of an older version an I love this song as well as the older version. It has words that just stick in your head and give you this indescribible feeling."
1,a dud.,"Product looks and feels great, but after the first day, the valve latch broke off.It was relatively easy to take the valve apart to switch between Presta and Schrader valves, but while pumping a Schrader valve, the pump valve seemed to always leak air slightly. When I pressed back on the valve latch to check if it was locked correctly, the latch snapped off.Pick another pump!Pros: look and feel, aluminum, mount-anywhere bracket, lifetime warrantyCons: leaked and broke while pumping with Schrader valve"
3,Highland Flame 2.5 stars,"Aileena and Alex fell in love way, way too quickly for my liking. I understand that exceptional circumstances can lead to this but it made the romance part of this book a little boring for me. Neither one of the characters had much personality at all either."
5,i love this record,This CD is full of life and it makes me happy. I wish this guy would keep it coming!
5,May Take Some Time To Love,"When I first bought this bootleg I thought it was extremely overrated and wasnt that great. Reason being was that it does have about 5-6 mistakes through the show. Its a really loose and relaxed show like another guy mentioned. The more you listen to it the more that is obvious. The guys have fun and put on a pretty tight show, except for those few flubs. No show is perfect. The sound mix is still as clear as a live show can be. A good sound mix. The setlist is also pretty strong. Its not the best Euro show from 2000, but is still a strong performance of a wonderful band having a great time. Thats what counts to me. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a good show from the band. It may take some time to really dig in to its beauty, but its worth it. Im still trying to dig deeper into it. Its really a different show."
5,Cardiff gig,"I'm from Cardiff, and I went to this gig. Thought that it was a really good show and Eddie Vedder made the hair on the back of my neck stand on end as always.My favourite part of the evening was when the whole place joined in to sing Betterman and it sounds great on the CD."
4,Cary Grant and Grace Kelly - what's not to like,Cary is his usual smooth self - Grace is beautiful. Great plot - Someone is emulating now retired jewel thief Cary 'the cat' and stealing jewels along the Rivera. Cary has to catch the thief and expose the thief to the authorities.
4,Absolutely delightful!,"Wonderful collection of real letters between an American book collector and an English used bookseller. Quick, funny read. They only sad part is that if you go to 84 Charing Cross Road in London, there is a Pizza Hut there now. But there are several used booksellers nearby to give you the flavor of what might have been there."
5,Isla de luz,This and the other two books in this series are great for intermediate readers. I love that these kind of books are available and wish there were more. I have read all three and find that the english meaning for words they deem to be difficult are at the bottom of the page. There is also a dictionary at the back of the books.Wonderful!
4,Kids love to go fishing!,"I bought this for my 2 children (almost 4 and 2 1/2) to share. They both really enjoy the game! We have playdates often and this is always a favorite. Sometimes the string gets caught around the reel of the fishing pole and I have to unravel it, but otherwise, zero complaints. I love the tackle box it comes with to store all of the pieces. Good purchase!"
3,"Fun, but fishing line gets tangled very easily","My daughter got this today for a birthday present and she and her sister have had a great time playing with it. However, the fishing line has gotten tangled twice and I think after this second time it may be permanently tangled. Not sure if I can fix this without cutting the line as I can't take apart the reel."
5,Excellent Show,I was at this show and it was truly amazing. I have since been converted to being a PJ fan (many can't believe I wasn't before). The boys were extremely excited to be doing the show and they absolutely cranked.
3,Not quite for me,"I'm not a musician, so can't comment knowledgeably about Ms. Johnson's talent. I'm also unfamiliar with several of these pieces, but can say that all but a few left me unimpressed. I did like Howard Blake's ""Walking in the Air,"" which is what prompted me to order this CD after hearing it on KUHF here in Houston. Johnson's renditions of ""Sometimes I Feel Like A Motherless Child"" and the Satie ""Gymnopedie"" variations are quite listenable, as well. The rest just don't seem to be to my taste in music."
3,It's not quite what I had in mind,"It's not quite what I had in mind. To tell the truth, I expected a lot more biography of the various settlers to Canada than the cold list of names that were presented. It is nice to have them, as several of them are my ancestors, but more flesh to the characters would have been appreciated. Also, those of Scottish ancestry from the USA could have been included as a great many United Empire Loyalists could have been included in this list."
3,Volume 1 - 1998 is only one of Four Volumes,"I have Volume 1, but my Ancestry.com reference for my ancestors are all found in Volume 3 which I do not have and cannot seem to find. Volume 1 has 12,500 entries; Volume 2, published in 1996 adds an additional 11,000 names. Volume 3, published in 2002 adds 1820 names and volume 4, published in 2005, adds entries for settlers, pastors, shoemakers, and captains in the militia as well as those who did not survive shipwrecks and fires. Volume 1 is great if you find yours among the 12,500 entries, but I didn't. I'm seeking Volume 3 if anyone has it."
5,A Gift for Storytelling,"I just finished reading Without Wings by Lia Scott Price and decided I had to write to say how much I enjoyed the story. While reading it, I felt the pain, the anguish, the pure and raw emotions from her characters. I am so greatly impressed. To finally stumble upon a writer with a gift for storytelling, I would just like to say congratulations on this, what I consider to be a masterpiece of a story. I hope to read more of her works! --A new found fan."
2,Not worth the money,"A little disappointed. My son didn't like to play with it much. Me and my husband tried it, we both think the graphics are so-so. The control is difficult, you kinda lost track where you are going due to the difficulties to control the movement of the car. Maybe it takes a while to practice in order to get used to it but I am not motivated to go back to the game."
4,Great Game!,"I really enjoyed this game. It is a good game for the GAME BOY COLOR. It has muscle cars and some other nice cars like the DODGE VIPER you can buy and drive. Quite a few tracks. Their is a cop chase mode where you have to give people tickets. Kinda weird. Bird's eye view. Pretty good graphics for GAME BOY COLOR, not like the PS2 or anything but alright."
2,recyling?,"I had a game boy as a child when they first came out. One of the first games I got for it was a title called ""super RC pro-am."" This game is exactly the same only ""colorized."" Right down to the tire squeels and track shapes. How dumb. I thought the game boy color titles would be far more advanced and much better looking, but this is just a ""blast from the past."" If you've never played ""Super RC pro-am"" then you may like this title. Still, you can't just go around recyling games. It's not right I tell you!"
2,Errrrr....It's kinda strange...,"Pokemon is NOT one of the best movies ever created. It's also not the best animation, either. First off, it doesn't make any sense. The characters say that ""fighting is a lot different than battling. Sure, you try to win but you don't try to beat each other."" Uhhhh...okay, that didn't make a thread of sense...Next: ANIMATION. The characters move jerky and they always seem to have a huge drop of water on their forehead. Not the greatest.The wacko hairstyles of some of the characters are always worth a laugh. One guy's hair looked like a hairsprayed pine cone that was dyed banana yellow. Another guy looked like he had a hairy brown pancake on his head.Pokemon is good for little kids, but if you just want to watch a dorky movie, get this."
4,Does the job,Good strong rubber suction cup. Stayed on the transom of my aluminum 14' fishing boat which is a smooth surface.Only drawback was I forgot to mount it before putting the boat in the water. Air temp was 38 degrees...water not too much warmer = cold arm!Stayed on going full speed. I tied the string to my o/b motor mount.
4,Really FUN game,"We really enjoyed playing this game over the weekend. Saw it at a store while out of town and thought that it would be a fun alternative to playing cards! Had a great time playing. Scoring system is a little goofy, but it was fun!"
4,Laguna Beach Punk is on!,"The Stitches put on one hell of a show and now you can hear it on CD! They kill Shane McGowan's ""That woman has got me drinkin'"". The only shortcoming was the lack of length of the CD. We want to see more!!!!"
2,This game is not fun!!,"The game is really dumb, all you do is ride around a track a bunch of times. It is way to easy, I beat it in about an hour with no retrys. I think it would be a big waste of money, BAD investment."
1,"DON""T BUY THIS",If you wasted your money on this game i feel sorry for you. I made that mistake. This game has no depth or skill involved its so full of cheese its not even worth using for TP. I'm warning you.
4,A Reader,Mr. Kaeo realized a good job in order to applying security concept throught practical examples. Designing Network Security resume and apply ideas about corporate security which enhance practicioner and academic review his own security models look for different alternatives in changing world of Technology.
2,Mixed Bag,"Up through Chapter 7, this book presents a fairly good overview of information security in general, network security basics, cryptography, and a good measure of ""security philosophy"" as well. It reads pretty well and there are relatively few inconsistencies, until...From Chapter 8 onwards, there are lots of mistakes (my personal favorite is a botched explanation of TCP proxies on page 248) and many cases of examples not matching the explanatory text. And when it comes to enabling TACACS+ on routers, some sections of this book directly contradict Cisco's ""IOS 12 Network Security"" book.All in all, a decent reference for Cisco routers & firewalls, but you might want to supplement it with something more substantial. The O'Reilly books and Cheswick/Bellovin come to mind..."
1,Out Dated User Interface!,"Please look around and be more futuristic.Peachtree has lots of unfixed bugs and is out dated. I tested some software and found some really good, with reasonable price: BusinessWorks, Small Business Manager (microsoft.com), Quick Business Manager (bisaim.com),Vision Point 2000 (ACCPAC), BusinessVision 32 (Softline).Good Luck in your search."
1,Stuart Smalley's Daily Affirmations!,I will overlook that this attempt at spinning out parts of the Bible for women is based on the inferior NKJV translation. In the end this book does nothing except to prey on us women.
5,a guide for improvement,i loved this bible and all it's everyday pearl of wisdom and extra readings that we can all apply to our lives.
5,"Holy Bible, Woman Thou Art Loosed","I love this bible! It speaks to my issues and has been a source of comfort, peace and enlightenment in my life and my relationship with the Lord. I would recommend this to woman who desire a closer relationship and walk with walk with Jesus Christ!"
4,The Best way for the WORD of GOD,"I had received this as a ""gift"" from my cousin. This had helped me to ""heal"" from a major crisis in my life. When I was healed and able to carry on, I forwarded to a co-worker that also had a major crisis in her life. She then passed it on and so on. When my cousin died, I tracked the original one that I had from my cousin so that I could have something that she cherised, now that she was ""gone"". I then proceeded to order 2 from amazon.com and have since shared them with people in my life that have a hurt or a need. You to will get what you need from the Word of God, when you order His Word.God Bless"
2,Holy Bible,This Bible is pleasant but not very interesting if you are looking for a bible with footnotes. I was disappointed with it.
1,STILL HAVENE'T RECEIVED IT!,I have ordered this item over a month ago as a bday gift. I still have not received it as that state that it was not in stock and will ship when available. Horrible business.
5,LOVE THIS BIBLE,I've had this Bible for years & enjoyed it so much that I puchased one for my sister & mother. My favorite are the pearls of wisdom & inspirational inserts. My husband even enjoys reading them. I just wish T.D. Jakes made a male version of this Bible!
5,woman thou art loosed bible,"very good bible for women of all ages, very inspirational. simplifies the scriptures, and applies it to daily life. anyone can value this bible and learn a great deal, a great investment."
5,"The perfect Bible to read, study, and learn about God's word.","I was/am very pleased with the delivery and condition of the Holy Bible, Woman Thou Art Loosed. It is an easy to read and understand Bible. I received my Bible on the designated delivery date. I would recommend this company to everyone."
5,The Perfect Bible for a Woman!,"This is a wonderful bible put together with God's Guidance for women. It is especially beneficial for women who had/have difficult relationships with their fathers and with men. TD Jakes speaks to a woman's heart and teaches us how to trust our Father in Heaven by including useful teachings that highlight specific people in the bible and specific passages. What's wonderful about this is he inserts it in places where the passages are located so you can read the teachings and the bible verses or vice versa. I know he made me read my bible more. I am a Christian and I listen to Christian radio, music, pray daily, attend church regularly everything but I couldn't/wouldn't do my bible reading. This bible has helped me to drink in God's word. It is truly an annointed bible. God bless TD Jakes!"
1,Toshiba has Poor Customer Support,"I have trouble with the image on my Toshiba 62hm94 and since have been checking user reviews found on the web. Well I just thought I would share that I have had similar troubles getting anywhere with the repair of my television. When you call customer service they do thier best to not identify when you may expect a repair, or what you should expect of them. Very frustrating."
5,A can't miss Arthur book!,"""Arthur and the Cootie-Catcher"" is a book that I'm more than sure kids will love. It has an exciting storyline, and I like how Marc Brown was smart to put in the instructions. There were too amy good parts, so I can't say which part's my favorite. Either way, I highly recommend that everyone should read this."
4,Cute Book,"This book is very cute, although, the little cowboy only has clothes on in the first 4-5 pages. He is covered though, with a boot, this dog, birds, etc. The story is very good, and explains why he has no clothes on. Bought this for a little cowboy, who loves this book!"
2,"Extrordinarily, Mind-Numbingly, BORING!","While this book does have some interesting things to say on the subject of mass psychology, it is by no means an exploration of other realities, dimensions, etc. Pick up Hyperspace by Michio Kaku for something worth while.This is nothing more than a Karl Jung text-book with some notable quotes, but nothing new is explored here."
2,bad book or bad translation?,"I was expecting an interesting point of view about this topic, but what I found was kind of confusing, i found contradictions between ideas, they were not clearly exposed.I was expecting maybe more philosophy related subjects. But I read the spanish version, and I am not pretty sure if it was appropiate translated."
1,Self-contradicting and Silly,"I started to read this because it presented itself as a serious discussion of what I thought would be an interesting topic. In the introduction, the author leads the reader to belive that he will look at the history of sightings of various things (UFOs, fairies, bigfoot, etc.), and offer a serious analysis of their psychological implications.Despite claims to the contrary, the author clearly believes fairies are real. People who don't believe in them are ""unwise"". His evedence for the reality of these various creatures is that people keep seeing them.When the author seriously suggested that a reasonable person should conclude that the psychic surgeons of the Philipines were using magic, I stopped reading. I couldn't take it anymore.That said, if you believe in Yetis, gnomes, and trolls, you will probably love this book."
4,"Beautiful, but fragile","The picture on the TV itself is stunning. HD feeds are the best, good-quality DVDs are pretty good, and regular feeds, well...you can now see the difference. In terms of performance and picture, I'm very pleased.My advice to purchasers is to make sure the delivery guy waits while you unpack it and power it on for a test. I naively sent him on his way, only to find out that something inside the TV itself is broken, causing a distortion in the picture on the screeen. The retailer (Vann's) was very quick about arranging for the return and exchange of the product, but it would've been easier if the deliver guy was still there."
1,Terrible Picture quality!,"I owned this tv for about six months and I realized that enough was enough! The picture on this set is just horrible, the blacks aren't even black and the color is just abysmal! As time went on, I began thinking that I had made one of the worst purchases ever! The picture on this tv is average when there is lots of light in a scene, but watch dark content material and it is terrible! I now switched to a Panasonic TH-42PX60U, and that plasma has it going on! Great contrast, color, black levels! It is just plain beautiful, sure you may pay more but it is worth it! HD content is out of this world and the image is so lifelike. The image on the toshiba is just dull and lifeless, it could never compare to my panny plasma."
1,not even working for a month,purchased 8/22/05 - no longer working 9/2/05. It has just been taken into the shop.
2,"Ok, but it blames the Christians","I usually really like episodes by Secrets of the Dead, but this one annoyed me. It gives three possible ways that the fire started: Nero set it, it was an accident, and the Christians set it to fulfill a prophesy. Yeah...and they had a death wish. Ridiculous."
4,HE WAS OUR AMBASSADOR,"MAURICE CHEVALIER was the first FRENCHMAN to really make it in HOLLYWOOD when the pictures started to talk.He was a great entertainer even if his singing was far from great.It is hard for youngsters today to imagine why this guy was so popular and came to symbolize FRANCE throughout the world.Perhaps you'll be surprized to learn that as joyful as he looked, MAURICE once had a nervous breakdown after he played with DRANEM in the opérette LA-HAUT.After that,he never went down again.This double collection gives you his best songs and only a few fillers in the first disc;you'll also hear in a few songs his wife YVONNE VALLÉE.MAURICE had actually met her during his breakdown and their relation will end after a few years.He had actually learned ENGLISH during the first war while being a prisonner, and he was saved by MISTINGUETT who had relations to get him out.He played with her in many revues ,and then went out on his own and like they say the rest is history."
3,Much better than Karen Bentley!,"This book was so much better than Karen Bentley's Cindy. It also tells why Champion is gone, why Christina doesn't have a younger sibling. It makes up for the time gap in between Cindy's Honor and The Horse of Her Dreams. This Cindy is not a spoiled girl. She takes herself for the blame when Ashleigh loses the baby. I can't wait for Cindy's Bold Start. Cindy will actually race again!"
2,cindy's desert adventure,"I found this book to have little if any story line. There were three places max that this story took place in. Most Thoroughbred stories have at least 3-6 events, settings, places, etc. This book was not very interesting and I therefore would not suggest this book to anyone."
3,Pretty good,"I thought that this story was pretty good. I think that I read it more just because I'm reading the series. The beginning was a bit weak, but after that it got better. The second 2/3 was pretty good, but the first third could have used just a little improvement."
4,"Good, but a bit of a surprise.","Cindy's Desert Adventure just snuck itself into the series, in my opinion.I have to say, first, that Cindy is my least favorite character in the Thoroughbred series.She was snotty, stuck-up, and any other words that don't point to anything good.After Glory's Rival I gave up on the Cindy books.It always turned out the same: the horse won the race by an amazing margin.But when Cindy made an appearence in the later books(which are wonderful,but the first few with Wonder,Pride,and the rest are still my favorites) she slowly became a character I could stand.This is a good book, and well written, but it still didn't quite have that... flame that some other books of this series have had."
4,Yay!,"Hooray! So many loose ends were tied up in this story! Ok, so it wasn't written with the best story line ever, or with someone's fave characters, but at least the ten-year hiatus was filled! But this just sort of leaves me wondering- if the gap has been filled, what will the use of #48 be? What more is there to tell? About Cindy racing in NYC? It might be fun to find out!"
5,Cindy's Back,"Yeah Cindy is back and hopefully getting better ! I love this series and Cindy adds a nice touch with all the characters and hopefully the story line will just get better and better and I can hardly wait for ""Cindy's Bold Start"" ! :o) So I am proud to say I have every book in the series and I wish they would never end ! :o)"
2,GOOD GOD WHOEVER MADE THIS SHOULD BE SHOT,"I didn't really think about which fastener to buy when I was at the store but I wish I had. These look easy, but as stated by the other two reviewers, getting off the little fastners is next to impossible. After spending about half an hour trying to get off the fasteners something someone said on here got me to realize how to do it.So this is how you do it. You'll get two types the velcrow and the kind that stick to the velcrow. Do not try to peel off the back laminate like I was, it wont come off. Instead peel off each individual black thing. You'll have to peel hard and some of the adhesive will probably come off.The ""engineers"" (I use that term loosely) who made this could have perhaps tested this on a sample audience"
1,Can't get them off the plastic!,"I just bought these without reading any reviews first (big mistake). They are impossible to get off of the plastic mounting. I was so frustrated that I came on Amazon to see what other people thought and sure enough, other reviewers said the same thing. It looks like other Scotch fastener products are reviewed well, but stay away from this specific type!"
5,Maybe it is Stone's fault.,"If you're not a PJ fanatic, I can see how the lyrical flubs in Alive, Whipping, and Immortality could make this annoying. However, if you are, the absolutely perfect takes of Release, Given to Fly, Corduroy, Smile, and Yellow Ledbetter more than make up for it. Warts and all, this is up there with Seattle and Chicago as my favorite bootlegs to date."
5,A Field Naturalist's Classic,"I am pleased to see this book has recently been reissued. I have an old, but treasured paperback copy. The author is observant of, informative about, and acutely responsive to the environment she describes. Having experienced winters in that region I would say she is especially adept at rendering the harsh, but radiant winters."
5,Women composers have their day.,"3 wonderfully inventive pieces from 2 female composers of 20th century music who are just getting their due.Nothing earth shattering here, but beautiful piano & string music straddling romantic and modern references.the real find here is Rebecca Clarke's Piano trio (with subtle hints of Bartok though thoroughly her own) and her Viola/piano sonata.Clarke was a Viola player herself and she writes beautifully for the instrument. Heart rending stuff.Martin Roscoe (piano) and The Endellion Quartet are so inside this music, it is hard to imagine it will ever sound better.This is the best pianism from Roscoe to date.ASV sound engineering is superb. Warm and transparent with rich round bottom.A great CD with which I believe is the ONLY recording available of the TERRIFIC Piano Trio.This one's a KEEPER."
4,T-Fal Iron,"I was disappointed because when i received the product a piece was broken. The iron was still usable, but I expected a new product to arrive without defects. The product itself is great. It's heavy duty and works rather quickly. I would suggest it to others."
2,Not a great choice.,"After recieving this iron, I discovered that it hs no automatic shut off and no tip over shut off. A definate deal breaker. Also, It's not full sized. Gave it away."
3,Disappointed...,"#1 disappointment: This unit does NOT have a digital synthesized AM/FM Tuner; it uses an old fashioned tuning wheel. Sony tries to compensate by using AFC on FM, but with all of the stations here (near LA), it probably would drift into another station with changes in temperature during the night. AM is very susceptible to AM interference and not very sensitive.The power backup only holds for one minute; does NOT have a battery backup.Audio power is only 1.2 watts per channel (3in. speakers), but sounds adequate. (Spec is 10% distortion)Choice of CD music track for wakeup and dual alarms are nice features.I will upgrade to a better unit."
2,annoying hum,I bought this model almost two years ago and keep it on my nightstand. It has developed a humming noise that varies in volume. It is loud enough to wake me up at night from time to time. Annoying enough that I need to replace it.
2,"Low Price, Low Performance","Like most Sony low end products, you get what you pay for. The price for the item is fair. But, don't expect much. Analog tuning and just ""ok"" sound.I have upgraded to the ICF CD2000, lists for around $189.00 It is portable and has great sound. This is the second model in the series. Stay away from the older portable model. I was told by sales people that there were lots of returns. Sorry do not have that model number."
5,Excellent Instruction!,"I love the picture in picture that shows a close-up of the dancers' feet! Also the screens that are shown to ""review"" the concepts are very helpful. Definitely worth buying!"
4,Don't Take it Seriously and you'll not be disappointed,"This movie is what it is. A movie about a martial arts wielding Jesus vs. a group of lesbian vampires. It never claims to be anything other than what it is. Do not take it seriously, and if that kind of thing offends you, just refrain from watching it."
4,Good beginners' guide.,"This book takes the beginner from scratch to being able to competantly handle PostgresQL databases.The only real drawbacks as far as I could see are the lack of some python examples, and the use of MS Access. Even though I am a linux convert, I am not necessarily biggoted against Micro$oft.But while I have a wealth of RDBMS background, I needed to know two things: one, how to configure and execute postresQL under linux, and two, what GUI tools are available to do this. Hence my disappointment at the use of MS Access, which I already know anyway.Still it is a good book to kick off with."
3,Great beginner book!,"This book is great for someone with very little database experience who wants to run an open source database on Microsoft Windows. There is a fare amount of attention to Windows-based tools, including instructions on how to get the product to run under Windows, and accessing data from Windows-based software. The book is easy to read with a nice layout, similar to other great WROX books.The book is great for the beginner, and spends time on data selection, basic design, and interfacing with C, PHP, Java, and Perl. There is very little attention to database administration, about 30 pages, which makes sense considering that the title of the book includes the word 'beginning'.If you have some experience with databases/SQL, perhaps moving from a different database product, running Solaris or Linux, the PostgreSQL Developers Handbook is a better choice. If you are a developer, the PostgreSQL Developers Handbook is especially a better choice."
4,Good book for beginners,"I have no previous Postgres experience, but the book did allow me to accomplish what I needed to do. I believe this will make a good reference book. All in all I would recommend this to a new or novice postgres user."
5,Great Book,"This book is wonderful. The recipes are great,with easy to find ingredients and beautiful pictures. i've only made the cranberry tea bread,but it was the best cranberry nut bread recipe i've ever used! will have to try ALL the recipes!"
1,Lacking,"My advice is to save your money. Get their catalog with free recipes in it and spend your money on a worthy cookbook. This one is of very little value. It is , like their restaurant, highly over-rated and over-hyped. I purchased this book on impulse because of the colorful pictures. It was only when I searched it for interesting recipes that I discovered that it was lacking for any cohesiveness. Only one who has endured a meal at their flagship restaurant would understand what the recipes are doing in a book together. At best they are hit or miss."
3,Not like the restaraunt,"When I saw this cookbook I said,""Great, now I can enjoy Black Dog food without enduring the famously long wait and arrogant attitude."" Boy, was I wrong.The authors seem to be so involved in self promotion that it's a wonder they have any time to cook!The recipes are not what I eat at the Black Dog on the Vineyard. There is not even any mention of the brand of pancake mix I see the breakfast chefs mixing up on Sunday mornings through the open doorway of the busy,filthy kitchen. The recipes changed a lot in translation from high volume to home sized. I would probably like this book better if it were what is presents itself as, Black Dog Recipes.The restaraunt on the Vineyard prides itself in it's ""daily changing menu"" This book contains some excellent recipes hidden in the fluff and almost unbearable ramblings of its overly self aware authors."
5,As good as the Restaurant,"I rate recipes on a 1-10 scale. In 3 days, we have four recipes over 9! I have read the book cover to cover twice. It is not only a cookbook but a giant slice of the Black Dog Tavern and its people - enjoyed immensely - almost as good as having breakfast there!"
4,Great book...big fun for little dough!,"I'm a Sys Admin for a large corporation and I think this book is WELL worth the money. It is clearly and concisely written, and has the best section on NFS mounting that I have ever read. This book is NOT for beginners, but is rather helpful for those of intermediate to advanced HPUX skill levels. Overall, a great read...and a reasonable price too!"
1,NOT FOR BEGINNERS -- PEOPLE NEW TO COMPUTERS,"I was given this book when I started a new job as a systems administrator. I am new to the computer field, therefore I don't have a huge understanding of certain aspects of computers and their operations. If you don't have years of computer, system administration, experience on a different platform, don't buy this book. This book is for experienced administrators who get the lingo. If you are a person like me who needs a thorough walk through, i.e. first do this, second, etc., then don't buy this book. It is for experienced admins who need to quickly look up something that was forgotten. NOT FOR ""TRUE"" BEGINNERS!"
5,I love it!!,"I could not believe this Barbie set.... At the time I purchased this item I was very skeptical. I received the car, Barbie and Skipper today. I took them out of the box and immediately came to the computer to order 2 more for Christmas gifts. ...my mom even would like to purchase this Barbie set."
5,"Glorious land, hopeful outcomes","I thoroughly enjoyed reading this finely written book, which is of the most satisfying kind--an easy read with an underlying sense of purpose that leaves the reader feeling complete. Hyatt's writing style is accessible, but literate, and the writing soars when describing the colors and moods of the southwestern landscape. The book is full of interesting characters who are trying to define themselves, and we find ourselves plumbing unexpected depths in their seemingly mundane lives. The author skirts around the temptation to find easy, romantic solutions. There is much humor in this book, but also a sense of mystery and wonder. And if I ever get another pet, I want J N Hyatt to provide the name for it!"
4,The are square,"They are quite square and work great. The problem is that one of them ( the 4"" one ) came with a burr on it. I emailed Highland Hardware directly asking for direction and received no response. That miffed me a bit, but the value is only slightly diminished by this."
5,Mikasa Arctic Lights Wine,"Very very happy with these wine glasses from Mikasa. I have ordered crystal from Mikasa previously, and could not be more pleased. The glasses are very heavy and just beatiful enough for any table. Would highly recommend them, very satisfied."
3,Something you need to know.,"I love these glasses. I have always bought them in a store in the past, but I needed more for our growing family. The pictures comparing the types of glasses is missleading. I ordered the Mikassa Arctic Lights Goblet thinking it would match my wine glasses. But it is a very long-stemmed glass and not at all what I thought I was getting. I also misunderstood and got just one glass. I thought I was getting a set of 4 glasses. Now that I have the one glass to compare, I can see that what I really wanted was the Mikasa Arctic Lights Wine. At least I hope that is the right glass. I'll see when I get it. Wish they had given the dimensions of the glass. I could have known if they had given the length of the stem since the ones I have are a few inches shorter. I also think the ad should make it clear that you are only getting one glass. Since I always bought at a discount store, I thought the price was reasonable for four."
2,Not what I was expecting,"I was married 17 years ago and registerd for the Arctic Lights wine glasses. I had a complete set and yet somehow 4 of them disappeared in the last few years. I was excited to find these on Amazon and ordered 4 replacements. Unfortunately, in the last 17 years, these glasses have changed. They are slightly shorter than what I had previously, the etching is not quite as distinct, and there is an etched ""Mikasa"" on the base. Oh . . . and my husband says they don't make the same tone. I will still use them but they are in the back of my cabinet instead of the front."
4,Hilarious!,"I decided to order this CD because of the satire of the ""Titanic"" phenomenon, and because of its references to ""Star Trek"" ... two legends that I love. I wasn't disappointed! The writing and the humor were clever, the voice talents of the impressionists were excellent, and the interpolation of all the final elements (music, sound effects, etc.) made for a quality production. Some of the celebrities impersonated were a little obscure (perhaps they were simply before my time ... I grew up in the 80's), but that's my only real complaint. Parents should be cautioned, the language is ""PG-13"" (about two or three instances of the ""sh"" word), and the dialog between the captain and his computer is mildly racy, but the hilarious ending itself is worth it! I'll probably end up ordering another copy for my sister and brother-in-law ... I know they'd love it as much as I did!"
3,Unhappy with Amazon!,"The book is fine, however I'm not impressed with Amazon at all. I ordered two books, but after 5 weeks of waiting, I've only received one of them. Service is much to slow!In addition, Amazon did not send my book via United Parcel Service like they said they would. Instead it came via the US mail, and the box was badly mangled and damaged. Also, since the box did not fit in my mailbox, I had to make an extra trip to the post office to pick up my item.I'D MUCH RATHER THAT AMAZON HAD SHIPPED VIA UPS! THEIR SERVICE IS MUCH QUICKER AND MORE PROFESSIONAL. IN ADDITION, UPS WOULD HAVE DELIVERED THE ITEM TO MY HOUSE, INSTEAD OF ME HAVING TO MAKE A LONG TRIP TO THE POST OFFICE.I think that Amazon should review their service in regards to timely and better shipping. Waiting over 5 weeks on an item is unsatisfactory!"
2,Just didn't do it for me.,Workouts were way to easy and the instructors left me bored. I passed this off to somebody else in hopes they found more use out of it then I did.
3,Compilation 2,"This is an okay DVD. After working out to the compilation 1 DVD for about a month, I was ready to move on to something different. The first workout I tried was the core bound which was a little too challenging. It was hard to follow what she was doing. Next workout I attempted was the Hip Hop Bound. I was just starting to get the hang of it and it ended. It is too short. The workout only lasted about 10 minutes, not long enough. I did enjoy the dance bound as well as the box and bound. Traci can be a little too enthusiastic for me, but she does a good job. One thing I would really love to see on this entire series is a listing of the length of each workout. It would be easier for me to determine which workout I wanted to do if I knew how long it was. I really hated that I wasted my time even doing the Hip Hop bound, I didn't have time to break a sweat."
3,Life's Lessons,This is a great DVD for any young male to watch that is trying to get out of the hood. Know that there are consequences for every action or decision that you make in life. Learn from Karlton Hines success as well as his struggle! Don't take life for granted because you can be here today and gone tommorow. God Bless! Karlton Hines R.I.P!
3,Shooting Star rocks!,"this is a pretty good music DVD. if you are a big fan of the rock group Shooting Star, then this video is for you! you probably should buy it today. if you like classic rock music and radio, then maybe you can rent this DVD somewhere, or borrow it from a friend [...]"
5,})({,"i'd have to say that the casualties are one of my very favorite bands. i'm very picky about the music i like, and the casualties are QuaLiTy..not to mention they live not to far away. in my opinion, don't call yourself a punk if you don't own this album. {go buy it from a local store though..not online}"
5,Get this book,"I heard Captain Calhoun speak today at a meeting. He is 97 and is sharp as a tack with details from his experiences. I enjoyed listening to him. If his book is anything like listening to him talk, GET THE BOOK !!!!"
2,Shabby Product,"Product came with torn binding and pages were worn. If this is considered new by seller, I would beware of used."
1,Pay Attn - Don't Buy This Product - House Reeked,"I don't usually write reviews. However, I decided that I really need to describe my experience with this product so that you can understand why some people give it 5 stars and some give it 1 or 2 stars. I have two Persian cats who will use almost any litter. So I decided to try this because of the commercials and the reviews on this site. While the litter does a decent job at first of clumping and covering urine smell, it does nothing to knock down poop odor. Also, it needs to be changed very frequently to cover up the urine smell. For the first time in the 11 years that I've owned my two cats, my house actually reeked from the smell of the litter box. Even my cat sitter (who is a vet tech and helps me out when I need to travel) begged me to go back to a clumping clay litter.Don't ignore this post - I don't have anything to gain other than to save you money and the annoyance of determining that you need to get rid of this stuff."
1,Smells worse than poop!,"I picked this up because there was a coupon for it and I've been trying to find a litter that is more natural... This litter clumps amazingly, but it smells SOUR. I'm used to scooping the cat box, but this litter smells worse than cat feces and urine. I'll definitely be switching back to something less repulsive."
1,The Worst,"I think there was a typo on the bag because this is the World's Worst Cat Litter. I have multiple kittens and tried this litter because I hoped it would control odor better than other cat litters I have tried. Not only is litter extremely expensive for the small bag, but it is horrible! When I walked into the room where we keep the litter box the morning after I put this litter in the box I was met with the most wretched smell of urine and feces that I thought I was going to vomit. Apparently the cats were disgusted by the smell because they stopped using the litter box during the night and began pooping just outside of the box. I can't say I blame them, I would step into that stink-fest either. Save your money and just buy some Tidy Cat, you can get triple the amount for the same price and it works infinitely better."
2,It smells worse than my cat's feces,"It smells so bad. I think my cat litters in it and doesn't track his feces because he, too, is repulsed by the smell of the cat litter."
4,If I Showed You,"I really believe that if a barracks full of lumberjacks really listened to the words of Tree's CD, ""If I Showed You"", they would put down their chainsaws forever. After listening to the cut, New Mexico, I wanted to go there right then. This is not a CD that you will listen to only once, you will find yourself setting you player to repeat forever. The second cut, Highway, makes me sad, because we have all been down that road, however Tree will 'get there'. Anyone with such a sweet and so very clear voice will get there. When you buy this CD of Tree's you will thank yourself many times over. Anything Is Possible."
5,An original voice for the 21st century,"Jonathan Franzen's STRONG MOTION is one of the most original books I've read in years.At its most basic level, STRONG MOTION is the love story of Louis Holland and a brilliant seismologist, Renee Seitchek and of strange happenings in Boston.Ambitious, imaginative and quirky, Franzen successfully weaves moral, social and environmental issues into a complex, wry, intriguing and often humorous story about family and love.STRONG MOTION along with the excellent reviews Franzen has received for his latest book THE CORRECTIONS (the current Oprah pick), should make Jonathan Franzen recognizable as an original voice for the decade."
3,Interesting Trip,"Young alienated man and woman seek love as they seek to warn of earthquakes caused by evil corporation. Such thriller fare redeemed by off-beat, distanced style. Fairly standard male protagonist, very interesting female protagonist, lots of interesting digressions into scientific matters. Minor characters have a cartoon feel (but so do many of Dickens'). Encounters with the pro-life reverend shows what the author could do if he'd let his ""evil"" characters come to life, as in Dostoevsky. Rants about spoilage of the earth and natural goodness of man by nasty white male colonists (then) and big corporations and almost everybody in America (now) were stylish but much less interesting (even in a satire). A writer to watch."
3,Over written but fascinating,"Each page had so many ideas that it was impossible to put the book down. I say that because I was also bored with the story that was in there somewhere. It was hard not to admire the depth of knowledge, his turn of phrase. I have read all of Frazen's books and his development as a writer is clearly shown from this an early work to his latest.Both he and his editors figured out how not to overwrite. The read is worthwhile for the ideas he presents, the story eventually emerges a bit while he shows off his iintelligence."
4,Strong Motion = strong book,"Liked it better than Freedom or Corrections.Balance of character, plot, humor.Could not put it down.Nice, neat ending.If you are familiar with any of his other works you must read this."
1,"BORING, UNINTERESTING","This is the most boring,dull and uninteresting book I have had the misfortune to buy in years. I tried hard to find something of interest in the book but quit halfway thru. Frazen gives us no reason to be interested, let alone like, any of the characters."
1,Let-Down,"After reading The Corrections, which I LOVED, I went in search of other Franzen books. This book was tedious, slow, boring, and simply uninteresting. It is so dreadfully dull and dry relative to The Corrections or 27th City."
4,Shaky Loving,"Franzen's ""Strong Motion"" is a good entrypoint into his oeuvre. As a Southern California resident, I am attracted to earthquake-related fiction, and the pathetic irony Franzen uses to tie the tremors to a young man's quest for an authentic relationship is thinly veiled but effective."
3,Franzen as Fictional Journeyman,"Franzen's strongest asset as a young writer today is his sense of humor -- it's dark, brooding, sometimes puerile and childish but mostly it is keen. He strikes me as the sort of person who is probably a pretty quiet, melancholy (maybe even pessimistic) person in real life, but the world of fiction (and some of his non-fiction) is his means of realizing the brighter side of himself. He probably works with a lot of self-doubt (what writer doesn't?) because some parts of Strong Motion seem labored -- the section on the Reverend for instance where he seems unable to fully realize what he finds so disturbing about mass religion. He is young though and his understanding of the relationship between a young man and young woman is certainly worth consideration."
2,Worked just past the warranty,"I'm extremely disappointed with this phone. When I first purchased it it had all the capabilities I was looking for. I only had two problems with the phone but the second one was a killer.The first problem was that I had to select which line I was going to use rather than have a switch that defaulted to my preferred line. I use the phone mostly for business and wanted to use line 2 but it defaulted to line 1. Switching the incoming lines didn't work so I was stuck pushing the line button every time I wanted to make a call.The second problem was that the phone quit working on line 2 about 14 months after I purchased it, 2 months after the warranty expired. I've used it for about a week as a one line phone but that just quit also.All in all I'm very disappointed with a product from a premier company such as Sony that failed to last much past the warranty."
3,"Good, but also not so good","I bought this phone based on its specifications. The phone's functions are very nice, but it has a serious problem. The microphone part has only a 1 mm hole; people complain all the time that I need to speak louder because they can't hear well. You have to position the headphone just right for them to hear you well. I went to a nearby store and I noticed that all Sony phones are built with the same limitation. This is enough to make me avoid Sony phones all together."
2,Sony headache,I have had the phone for some time and two different times I could not get it to work on touch dialing. I had to go to palse dialing to make it work than the speed buttons do not work. What go is to have expensive phone if it does not work
3,Barely a story,"The book is cute and it has a couple of interactive touch spots for kids to learn from, but the book is clearly made for a 6 month-1 year old. My daughter loves the Max & Ruby series and I have been looking to get her some merchandise. Unfortunately, none of the books I have ordered (that are listed on Amazon at least) compare to the show. Very little story and just a lot of thick paper."
5,Perfect Bedtime Story,"My 2-year-old son, Max, LOVES this book. He insists we read it every night, immediately followed by _Max's Toys_. The touch-and-feel areas are very small, although it doesn't seem to bother him. He just loves to open and close the window."
3,Too basic for 2-year old,This is a cute book. It does have some interesting tactile choices. Very basic story line. Left my 2-year old son wondering what happened to the rest of the story. More appropriate for pre-verbal children.
5,Fun book,My autistic son loves this book. The different touch and feel textures provide him with sensory input that he enjoys.
4,Minotaur,Great story with the usual mix of suspense and mystery. Barbara Vine has the ability to weave a complex tale with the pieces falling into place slowly and never predictably.
1,Absolutely awful!,"One of the editorial reviews for this book mentions that the nurse is initially fascinated by the sisters and their rich social life. Did we read the same book? A cloistered nun would have a more interesting life than anyone in that house. I kept waiting for something, anything, to happen. Usually in a British mystery that something is a murder that is solved. No such thing here - just endless boredom. Watching paint dry would be a better use of your time"
3,Too Many Characters,"This is an interesting story as are all of Barbara Vine's novels. However, I found there were too many names to keep track of and then remembering the personality that went along w/the name & character took away from the story. I found myself trying to remember which sister was which. I think if she had used less sisters as characters it would have been an easier read."
4,A truly cold comfort farm,"A young, but in no way naive, Swedish woman is ensconced in the most disfunctional family since Flora Poste visited Cold Comfort Farm ... but without the humor. Kerstin (whose name we're regularly reminded is pronounced ""Shastin"") comes to Lydstep Old Hall to care for a young man. As a registered nurse, Kerstin is well equipped to provide care for just about any illness. However, the source of John's problem is diffuclt to determine; he reportedly has some sort of mental illness, but he's definitely not the only person in the family with problems. Add a strong and nasty matriach, overly familiar family doctor, odd daughters, an unmarried vicar, and a sexually predacious painter, and Barbara Vine (aka Ruth Rendell) has given us all the ingredients necessary for a good and dark tale of the English countryside. There is definitely something nasty in this family's woodshed."
3,Okay..,"Clever, I suppose, but not as good as her other books. I only finished it a few weeks ago and can't remember much about it, which is an indication. Much preferred The Modest Samaritan that has everything a good novel should have; Interesting historic story line coupled with love and pathos. What a great read that was. The Modest Samaritan."
5,Nearly as good as the early Barbara Vine's,"Though not my favorite of Rendell's books written as Barbara Vine (her best are the first three she published as Vine - ""A Dark Adapted Eye"", ""Fatal Inversion"" and ""House of Stairs"") this was still an excellent psychological thriller and much better than her last ""The Blood Doctor"". I really felt her depiction of John's autism ""rang true"" and found it interesting that all of the true Cosway sisters had quicks that could be considered ""soft"" signs of autism or Aspberger's Syndrome. Like most Rendell/Vine stories the characters are far more interesting than the ultimate crime."
4,"Monsters, monsters, everywhere","In Greek legend, the minotaur is a bull-like monster who dwells in the midst of a vast labyrinth. In Ms. Rendell's novel, the title appears to be referring to John Cosway, an autistic man who lives with his mother and four sisters in a run-down, ramshackle estate. As the story develops, however, it seems that this is an entire family of monsters, with the son being,in actuality, the most human of them all. The mother and four sisters are almost completely selfish and self-motivated, often at the expense of their children or siblings, although one sister is perhaps a little better than the rest. This is not my favorite work by Ruth Rendell writing as Barbara Vine but I think it is one of the most memorable. Whether writing as Ms. Rendell or Ms. Vine, Ms. Rendell is such an expert at developing character, motivations, and interesting situations, that her books under either name are highly enjoyable and a true pleasure to read."
1,I grew outta this phase a long time ago,I don't hate this series. I just saw too many shows sickeningly similar to Pokemon. I call this genre the mons. Too many mons.More originality please.
3,Jiggly Puff Jigg a LeEEEeee Puff!,"Cute story. I don't like Pokemon, but Jigglypuff is so cute! Even though the title's called ""JIGGLYPUFF pop,"" there's only ONE Jigglypuff-related episode in this. That's why I gave it 3 stars."
5,This video is one of the best pokemon videos,If you are a Jigglypuff fan (Like Myself)you should Purchase this for you collection. It is Really funny what jigglypuff does to the Gang after she sings. Her singing is so... Z z Z z Z z *gotta catch 'em all* Z z Z z Z
5,loved it!,"I do a lot of work out DVDs at home, and I loved this dvd i would buy it for my at home collection because: it had hard work outs that i have never done before, and some i have. what i like is the 3 work outs became more intense and i felt parts of my buns i didn't even know i had. I did all 3 work outs for 5 days i rent it from amazon for 10 days and I could for real feel and see my buns looking better.-A real mom with not a lot of time to work out-"
1,BORING!,This is the WORST workout video I have ever purchased. I find this woman to be very annoying and the excersies and music make me want to take a nap. Jillian Michael is WAY better!
1,Don't bother,"I have used Pony clamps of different types for years and have always been pleased with their products. These clamps are an exception. They have absolutely no gripping power. A complete waste of money. I should have bought more 2"" spring clamps at less than half of the price."
1,Useless for thick smoothies,"I purchased this to make smoothies, and it was a waste of money -- after two attempts it went in the trash, because I wasn't about to spend more money to return it! I spent more time shaking the jar than blending with the motor, maybe because I use Greek yogurt, but the mix wouldn't move. Then I was unable to get the yogurt out of the little indentations near the top. Then the top malfunctioned and won't close. Don't even think about driving while drinking out of this, the lid does not open all the way so you have to tip your head way back."
3,"Great product idea, 1 bad design flaw","Well, Oster made this product line to be compatible with most of its blenders. That's all fine and dandy, and it works with all my protein shakes. The problem is, the blender SOUNDS different when I use this cup rather than the glass blender pitcher. It sounds as if it's struggling and ""smells like burning."" I can't for the life of me figure out why. It isn't getting stuck on anything, as I tried putting water in the cup and watching the blades spin. Also, when you screw the blade onto the cup, liquid can seep out from the bottom without its rubber gasket (which is easily losable in the dish washer). Milky protein shakes get pretty nasty when not cleaned up, so make sure you RINSE this cup after using, because crap just loves to stick to the inside after drying. However, it is a good idea and it works most of the time, I'm just worried my blender will explode one day while using it."
3,Love it-except for shipping cost,It does what it is supposed to do. No problems and I use it every day. Minus two stars for Amazons shipping prices. If I order from this site super saver shipping should apply.
1,misleading picture and discription,Deceptive description and picture! I thought I was ordering the glass cup with a straw as shown on the amazon page but a cheap plastic cup showed up without a straw.Item did arrive very quickly however it wasn't what I ordered.You would think you could trust the picture and description. I will be returning this asap.
1,Better seal footage on youtube,"As the other reviewers have already stated, the film quality or resolution in this DVD is insanely bad. If you are into seal footage as I am, you would be better spending your time watching videos of Navy Seals on YouTube. I would also recommend that if you are looking for a really great seal DVD set try BUDS Class 234 it is fantastic."
1,"this video,if you want to buy disc is waste your money","i got this dvd,this dvd is oldskool stuff~just only 20mins to tell me what is the navy seals,is really sucks,if you want to buy this,i think you need to think about it"
1,POORLY MADE,"THIS IS A POORLY MADE, VIDEO WHICH BY NO STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATIONIS WORTH WHAT WAS CHARGED FOR IT. IT SHOULD BE ON THE WALMART SHELF IN THE 499 BIN. A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY AND NOW A DUST COLLECTOR."
4,A little better than average.,"I thought this show in London was better than their previous night there, I think it has one of the better versions of Black which the crowd really gets into towards the end of the song, Eddie isn't very talkative but for the most part he seems in a good mood and Matt is having a more fun tonight with the drums ecspecially on Immortality which Eddie remembers most of the lyrics, all in all its a good show better than average but not their best European show."
4,Thomas learns about taking advice,"When Thomas gets assigned to the new passenger line, he's so proud that he won't take anyone's advice about taking his time to find the new route. Of course things go wrong and he learns the hard way, succeeding in the end. Nice illustrations complement this lesson on being overconfident and boastful, though I wonder if this is a problem for most kids?"
4,Blak Ninja Sword(wood),"This sword is a good quality sword. Solid wood, oak if im not mistaken. The whole thing is black no white piece. The hand guard and rubber stopper were the only thing stopping this from getting a 5. I just left them off and have loved practicing with the sword."
2,Mediocre Poetry and Lyrics Have More Power When Sung,"I am an Alicia Keys fan. I love this girl, so I was VERY excited when this book came out. However, her poetry is of the level of things I was writing about when I was 13. The thoughts are often shallow musings pretending to be deep. ""Something in your eyes/Is tortured"", sounds almost promising, right? Then she continues on with ""something is wrong (ya think?)/And it's hurting me."" DAMN, Alicia, you had me thinking I would get some deep thoughts for a second there. The metaphors she uses are often trite and some just plain don't work. Also, it's great to have the lyrics to her songs in book form, but without her delivery and fiery piano playing, these lyrics lose their luster. Alicia has writing of greater caliber than this in her head, for proof just check some of her ""journal"" entries at her official site. I don't know what went wrong with this book. At least it wasn't as bad as T-Boz''s ""Thoughts""."
4,"4 Letter Word - LOVE !!! (NICE!!! , COOL!!! , DOPE!!!)","the ""4 Letter Word"" poem I think was about LOVE ,it has to be. That was one of my favorite poems along with ""Mind Sex"" (cuz it was crazy , lol) , & ""Damn You!"" , but they all were nice. This book has 27 of Alicia's poems along with the lyrics to ""Songs In A Minor"" & ""Diary of Alicia Keys"". Mayne , I loved this book. Alicia is truly a talented poet , writer & musician. I highly recommend this book for her fans & people who like poetry & write poetry. Everyone can relate to this book.-> 1"
4,Soulful,"Ms. Keys has always come across as being real; there is no fakeness in her.This book is a perfect example of why I form this opinion of her.Gary Lloyd James, Author of UNTIED FEELINGS that contains poems such as...A Woman's TearsTo all women in abusive relationshipsThe tears she shed were not in vainThere lying on the floor with her dressBlood stained. Thinking about the pain, thePain that was inflicted because she complained.With her back against theWall, she waits for others opinions,about why she is lying there, curled upin a fetal position.When she speaks, she speaks with cautionbecause she fears her words may causeconfusion, in making a decision.Whether or not to stay married to this manthis man that said for him, she was the womanThe Queen, the Nubian, the African.Then why does she cry those tears?Is it because she fears his breath,pungent with beer?Fear his hand across her face, as she liesthere in that small dark spacewithout a way to erase,the pain, that caused those tears."
5,I really enjoyed these.,"Alicia Keys is not Maya Angelou and she's not trying to be. From some of the bad reviews I'm not sure that people got that. Granted, I may be biased because I'm such a big fan of her music, but I still enjoyed this compilation never the less."
1,"dissapointing, unsatisfactory poetry","I am a well known and respected poet from the bay area, and also an Alicia Keys fan. I was very dissapointed by this book, in which the poetry is mediocre and stereotypical. It sounded like one long running teenage rant, like ""why don't you love me? I am sad! I hate my life"" kinds of things. not intellectual or original. I am surprised because i thought she was lyrically better than that. The writing is poor, and on the level of a middle school student. People that I know that like this book have even admitted they are not familiar with a lot of poetry and don't know how to recognize good poems. Shes lucky she has the connections to publish a book, because if she was some regular girl no one would wanna read her poems."
2,ok,Alicia Keys still ain't fully moved me as a artist on a whole.so reading the Lyrics in Poem Form doesn't sway me that much at all.much Like Jewel did with her Book of Poems something seems kinda emypt upon reading them all.they are ok but not a Book I want sitting on My Coffee Table.
3,TFW Review,"i chose 3 starts because even though i ordered it new, it had some sticky notes in it, but its stil a great read. yes, i woukd recommend this."
3,"Was hoping for a little ""more""","After seeing her perform P.O.W. on Deff Poetry Jam, I just had to read this book. Some of the poems reminded me of stuff I'd written in highschool but were still interesting, then a good portion of the book is lyrics which most fans would already know. It took me all of maybe 30 mins. to read it."
5,excellent,THESE PORTABLE WORK GREAT WITH MY IPOD! THE SOUND IS EXCELLENT & I LOVE THE FACT THAT I CAN TAKE THEM WHEREVER I GO BECAUSE THEY R PORTABLE! I ALSO LOVE THE FACT THAT THEY FOLD & DON'T TAKE UP THAT MUCH SPACE!
5,He wrote it like I remember,The 32 nd Div had 654 days of combat the longest of any Division. It is nice to see our story told.
3,"Cecilia Roth is reat, the movie not so much","The movie was not that great. Although I always enjoy seeing Cecilia Roth. Still, not her best work. The movie does never really grab your interest. The movies is a little too complicated for what is actually a very simple plot."
2,A Depressing Hodge Podge,"If you like films that glamorize disturbed people and dysfunctional families, you'll probably enjoy this one. The flashbacks were too long and disjointed -- a far cry from the exquisite use of this technique in MEMENTO, for example. In fairness, the flashbacks did heighten the suspense of the ""whodunit"". Cecilia Roth's fine performance as Judge Teller shines through the muck of this depressing story. If you're looking for a well-made and acted ""steamy thriller"", BODY HEAT puts this one to shame."
3,Why not spend a few bucks more for real semi-auto?,"I would highly suggest anyone looking at this item give serious consideration to the Taurus PT 24/7 CO2 Powered Pistol. It has a higher velocity (enough to go in one side of an aluminum can and out the other) and doesn't cost much more.It doesn't have the hop-up system...because it doesn't need it. I can nail a ""for sale"" sign on the vacant lot across from my house, and it's 50 yards away.Save yourself the disappointment of buying a semi-auto look-alike that you have to cock between rounds, and go for the CO2 version, which will fire 15 rounds as fast as you can pull the trigger."
2,BEGINNING TAGLOG: A Course for Speaker of English,"This book is a disappointment to me. The book assmes a classroom situation. It assumes a teacher, tapes, and a laboratory. I have none of the above. There are no instructions at the beginning of a Unit. I would advise against buying this book unless you are enrolled in a Tagalog class."
3,rate,the shirt would have been my favorite...but it is crooked and not straight. I am not happy with it so I will not order any more.
5,Calcutta CT200 BC,"The affordable and functional ct200 is another great entry-level baitcasting reel. Baitcasting reels have always been known for the unsurpassed level of control they give over the placement of a lure, and the BC200 will have raw amateurs casting like the pros in no time flat. Control over backlashes is achieved with a calibrated magnetic cast control, which can be quickly adjusted to suit different lure weights and wind conditions. The BC200 comes with one stainless steel ball bearing, a versatile 5.1:1 gear ratio and a smooth cotton/molybdenum drag system.Features:Graphite BodyGraphite SpoolFriction & Magnetic Cast ControlsStainless Steel Ball BearingQuickfire II"
5,This is a great clock!,"This clock came out in Korea a little over a week ago. I bought it at my favorite Korean store to use in my bedroom. It(sony) is a great American brand I always try to find American things to put in my house. I got this one because i like Sony a lot. I have had a Sony clock beofer this and it lasted for many years. I just got it yesterday and i used it last night. Even though the shape seems a little wierd with the time being to the back of the clock it did not make a very big difference. I think I actually like it better the time being not right in your face, like most other clocks have their screen at the front of their machine. This is a wounderful clock my by one of the best American companies in the WHOLE WORLD."
2,Not his best work,"I expected Beckhard to tie his professional experiences to consulting practices and principles. Though that occured to an extent, I felt more like I was reading some sort of stream-of-conciousness narrative. The stories just seemed to ramble--no synthesis of ideas or cohesion of thought. The writing was mediocre at best.Some points were valuable, but not worth the investment of time and money. If you don't care about how you spend your money or your time, perhaps this is the book for you."
3,calasso's book is a brilliant mess,"Since I much admired Calasso's first book, The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony, I looked forward to reading this one. Unfortunately, it is a mess. Although full of interesting bits, the pieces fail to add up to a satisfying whole. The author is never able to define what he means by ""modern"" except to provide ever more anecdotes about Talleyrand. These are intriguing but unsatisfying. Calasso seems nostalgic for an old world when myths, customs, magic were taken seriously. But it is hard to be sure if even this nostalgia is the point of the book. Still one can't help but admire the wide ranging knowledge of this author and his sometimes eloquent writing"
3,Fragmata and Obscurata,"Very odd book. Full of nostalgia for the aristocracy of France, not unlike Nietzsche's nostalgia for the aristocracy of Rome and Greece. It is highly disjointed, indeed ofter incoherent relying upon dense references to obscure figures in the 18th Century. There is a thread of Rimbaud running through the text There are brilliant moments and insights, but no follow through or exposition. It is fragmata, obscurata, anecdotes, quotes from belles letres and diaries. Its central theme is musings on the loss of aristocratic legitimacy and the rise of the democratic mob. Worth reading if the French revolutionary period interests you and you are familiar with European culture of that period."
2,Disappointment,"After reading the wonderful book, The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony, I was expecting great things from The Ruin of Kasch. Unfortunately this disjointed, disorganized, collection of odds and ends never seems to pull together into any cohesive whole. The tid-bits about the life of Talleyrand were not substantial enough to maintain a narrative thread throughout the entire book. There wasn't enough cohesion around the Talleyrand sections to begin to say this was really commentary on this fascinating personality. Read The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony twice rather than read this book once."
4,Cute little book,"This is a cute little book with excellent pictures, but it left me wanting more. Many chapters are only two facing pages, and I would have liked to have seen more examples of each of the subjects."
5,"A beautiful, touching story","There are many emotions wrapped up in this movie, it is a joy to watch. Both of my kids (age 7 and 9) gave it two thumbs up. It deals with some heavy topics such as death and classism. But it does so in a very gentle and appropriate way. It also emphasizes the importance of honesty, work ethic, friendship, and creativity. The majority of the movie makes you feel so good about the friends and the loyal dog.In case you are afraid of a sad ending, there is a very dramatic climax which leaves you feeling gutted, but then is followed with a montage to remind you of all the wonderful things leading up to it. Lastly you are brought back to present day with the friends greeting each other and happily revealing what has become of their lives.It is a real shame that the movie wasn't distributed more. It is difficult to find but worth the effort."
3,"This is not 1975, but 1999 version.","This movie is based on TV animation which was produced in 1975, but completely re-produced. I think this is much better than US version directed by Kevin Brodie, which was mess."
4,so-so,"i'm not a big fan of anime, but the movie had a good story line. the problem is that i bought it for my five year old grandson (he asked for it), but it was a little hard for him to understand and way too long. he's never wanted to watch it a second time. i think it will be fine once he's a little older."
1,I NEVER GOT IT,"THEY KEEP PUSHING OFF THIS ORDER ,AND TILL TODAY I DONT HAVE IT , AND NOW DONT WANT IT.THATS HOW GREAT IT ISHAPPY NEW YEAR"
1,Review of recording,"If you are expecting to hear another recording and interpretation by another amateur aritst published by another unheard of record label, then you will recieve preciesly what you expected.The recording and intepretations provide another 'intepretation' by another rather unestablished 'concert pianist', lacking the profound musical understanding, performance and interpretation only attaintable by the greats.It is better to trust reputed record labels when buying recordings of these works"
4,"enfoque amplio, pero no para conservadores","En mi simple opinion, de positivo dire que la autora es una terapeuta con mucha experiencia, ha escrito abundante material y desarrollado su propio programa. Este libro en particular no lo recomiendo para personas con valores ""tradicionales"". Y ese detalle, en terminos generales, ser considerable para personas de cultura hispana.Como Relacionarse Mejor: Manual de Tecnicas Para Desarrollar Relaciones Mas Satisfactorias, Dinamicas y Duraderas (Serie Recursos Ministeriales)"
3,"Fascinating details, but little depth","Donald Morrill is at best in these essays in observing and cataloging stories and little sketches about the people around him in the various settings of these essays, be they friend, stranger, or fellow foreigner. For these stories, and for the ""telling details"", this collection is well worth the read. However, the only unifying theme between these episodes seems to be himself: how these people relate to him and illuminate his character, and he just doesn't exhibit the ability to present himself as much as an engrossing character as the people around him. As a result, the writing comes off as uneven, with brillant flashes connected by dull (even stereotypical, in these days of the best-selling memoir) introspection."
1,Haven't received my order yet!,"You wanted me to review the product I purched on 4/29/10 ""Davey & Goliath"" Vol.1 New Skates/Waterfall.I would be glad too. But have NOT received the order yet!"
4,A cute movie,this is my second favorite BET movie after Fire & Ice. The storyline is cute and it kept my interest.
5,Excellent Movie!,Great movie!!! True love story!! Loved it from beginning to end. Love sometimes can be right under your nose and you not know it!!!
2,Amazon Reviewer Reveals Entire Movie in Review- No Need to See,"I remember watching this movie on BET and after that I think they haven't shown it again. The movie was okay, but it wasn't all that. Anyway, don't waste your money on it. S. M. Anderson from (Lithia Springs, GA)just wrote in her review every darn thing that happened in the movie. So much for a 'masquerade""!"
5,This price was perfect,I love this movie. Always looking for black love stories at a good price. I would get more if the price was right.
2,Extremely Musty odor on this book,"This Book must have been stored in the, ""World's Mustiest cellar""..It's been in our garage since day one, airing out.I can only read it for a short time before my asthma starts...Interesting book and info, if you have a gas mask!Steel Worker Al"
2,I Came to Love you Late,I have NOT received this book and have NOT heard from the seller! NO STARS! (There is no choice for NO stars)
4,Sorry I missed it !,"I missed this event - big mistake !! It's great to get the CD, though - sounds like it was a helluva show. This is the only CD from the Euro Tour set which I have heard so far and if they are all like this, there won't be many disappointed Pearl Jam fans out there. The performance is lively and energetic and Vedder is in particularly fine form throughout. The recorded sound is vibrant and bright. Every instrument comes through clearly and the whole thing sounds very uncluttered and balanced. It is not overly powerful though, and sounds like an onstage recording rather than a PA recording (soundboard?). One point to note : This concert is not the longest of those available - so perhaps it is not the automatic first choice if you're only going to buy one CD from the entire set (hence only 4 stars). However, taken on its own merits it's well worth purchasing - especially if you were there on the night."
5,"An Awesome, Time Travel/Alt History Story",I'm a scifi fan and this is the only complete series I've ever read. At 700+ pages I assume this volume contains the whole thing. It's about an engineer/soldier mysteriously transported back centuries and how he changes history with his knowledge and initiative. Very thought provoking.
4,Mini Trampline Workout DVD,"I recently purchase a DVD for exercise to use on a mini trampline. I must admit that bouncing is not as easy,as I thought. The DVD is very compassionate and with out the bar,it is difficult the keep my balance. The instructor is aware that not all people are capable of maintaining their balance. So the tempo is okay and as I become more stable, I can keep up. DVD has many levels to choose and as I get better, I will advance also."
5,Basic Bounce!,"When I purchased the Rebounder and the videos, I wasn't sure that this was the best workout for me. I gave it a try and Holy Moly, folks! I love it! I will probably never run again. I have been able to get a full body workout, good cardio blast, and my joints aren't sore and achy! I feel great after each session. The videos offer an instructional (step by step), beginner, intermediate, and advance on the each of the cds. Go at your own pace! Modify the moves, but keep moving. Worked for me and for you too! Good Luck!"
2,"Good for workout, but...","I have been using my rebounder for over a year now with this CD and it is not hard to use. I started with the basic and rapidly worked my way to advanced. I am not a dancer and have played sports most of my life, but am now over 40 and have terrible knees. The rebounder works very well for bad knees, back, etc. My only complaint with this DVD is JB Bearns does, indeed, use the Lord's name in vain multiple times. That, and the rebounders in the background (namely Tracey Finan) are sometimes extremley irritating. I usually rebound without watching the video to avoid seeing the annoying gestures (flailing, dramatic arm movements, etc) Tracey makes."
5,Great DVD,"Great DVD and very happy with my purchase. I have been using it for only a week, and can feel a difference as far as endurance and ease. I will be using it 3 times a week for a few more weeks, then work my way up to 4 times. It is really a nice workout and easy on the joints."
3,Too easy,"I am new to rebounding and was looking for a more advanced workout, meaning one that would really get my heart rate up there. I've been through the Insanity and P90X workout series and am used to running up to 8 miles at a time. I love a good plyometric workout; but, one of my knees has been a little uncomfortable lately. So, I thought I'd try rebounding to lessen my impact. While this DVD obviously has some easier workouts, I thought the advanced one would push me enough, but my heart rate barely reached 120 while doing it. For someone who is not used to intense workouts, I would recommend it, mainly because it gives you a nice progression from very easy to a little more demanding and helps you to get comfortable with using a rebounder. I'm still looking for a really intense rebounding workout. Maybe I'll try using my rebounder with one of the Insanity workouts to see if that works for me."
3,Good Product!,I'm glad that I ordered this product to go along with my new Urban Rebounder....especially by the creator J.B. Berns. Thank you
1,Bad Purchase,This goes better with their type of rebounder and their beginner DVD was NOT for a beginner by any stretch of the imagination.
3,Personal Review,"I am 50 plus, rather active and have started on the Senior Rebounding section of the DVD to begin. It adds variety to my usual exercise routine of jogging, climbing stairs, yoga & pilates. Hope to be able to advance to the other sections soon as there are many of these to look forward to."
2,"Quick service, item not so good.","Very good quick service. . .but the DVD had too many scratches and doesn't work very well. . . next time I will purchase a brand new item. I think it was marked ""like new"" but I would consider it to be ""very used""."
3,Using a regular exercise trampoline,"I purchased this and I confess I've only tried it twice. I simply can't make it through the whole video. I am using a regular fitness trampoline rather than the expensive rebounder, and I am not sure if that makes a difference.This is a lot of fun, but I have to mix the exercise that they do with just jogging or marching in place to keep my heart beat from going through the roof. I'm not ""athletic"", but I do exercise daily."
5,Best potato cookbook I have ever read!,Beyond Burlap has an excellent assortment of potato recipes! I never knew there were so many ways to prepare a potato! The Potato Mocha Poundcake is my favorite. The stories and fun potato tidbits make Beyond Burlap a fun cookbook to own!All potato lovers should own this book!
1,I Was Deceived,"This is not the Ninja steel fan. The one I received was nothing like the one in the picture. I have a fan like the one in the picture. and I have had it for over 25 years to include 20 years in the army. This fan has been with me on military missions and everyday life, and I would put it up against fans like this fresh out of the package.To the point though...This fan was falling apart without being touched from the time I got it. I tried to contact the so-called Martial Arts Superstore, and they ignored me. I had in mind to buy many other items from this seller, but they changed my mind for me.And behind all this, Amazon.com was professional about the whole thing. They helped me when the seller just acted like I was not there."
5,Love Mary Kay,I love mary kay foundation and have been using it for years.It makes my face look smooth and flawless.
5,Mary Kay Medium coverage Beige 302,"I ordered the cream for my wife, and the product was delivered fast, when she tried it, she was very happy that the creat was as good as extected. Very good price, and a high quality product. Great seller, thanks."
3,"guide gear 7'6"" spin/fly combo","The rod and reel combo are good; however, don't expect too much from the extra flys and spinners. They are of low quality and are not worth using. The spinner reel does not have line on it. The case is too big to take backpacking with you. If I had to do it again, I would try the spinner travel kit."
2,Watch does not match product description,"This watch looks pretty good but is a lot shinier than it appears in the photos, with a lot of chrome all over. The ""unidirectional rotating bezel"" does not rotate. The links on the band are not uniform along the edges and give a low-quality appearance. For a large sized watch, the weight is surprisingly light, which gives it a cheap feel. The price here seems to reflect the brand name, not the quality."
1,Who can I sue about this film!!?!?,"This is not so bad, it's good: it exemplifies pure badness! Countless people die in this film in that extra-fake, ""Dr. Who"" style. They often have the ubiquitous line of ketchup-acting-as-blood on their forehead or near their lips afterward. Instead of showing one murder to illustrate that a duo is cold-blooded; they show four, similar murders in a row. Next, a woman gets into an expensive red car four times in a row. The main character is often seen shirtless here. But he ain't Action Jackson or Mr. Marcus! His chest was not impressive. Many of the roles that should have been played by middle-aged actors were played by people 25 years old or younger. If I were from NY, I would be horribly upset about how this low-budget stinker misrepresents my city. Awful, awful, awful! Please don't make the mistake I made wasting time in my life to see this."
5,Such a cute dress!,"My daughter received this dress for Christmas. She was thrilled with it! I loved it because it's long with long sleeves since she loves to dress up most of the day, much better than the short sleeveless stuff she has. I had a hard time deciding what size to get after reading the recommended ages and the other reviews. My daughter is almost 4, very skinny and tall. This dress fits great! Touchs the floor right now but fit well all over. She has growing room, but it's not too big! I gave a 4 stars for the durability because after a friend wore it around there were many loose threads. I just snip them, for the price and the cuteness I think we'll live!"
1,"Total rip-off, low ink. No better than Sharpie","Total rip-off, low ink. No better than Sharpie. The ink will be gone after writing on 100-200 CDs/DVDs. Get a sharpie instead for $1. This product is a total rip-off."
2,"Very, very shallow.","I was really disappointed with this book. I've never used Act before, and thought this would be a great book to start with. I read the whole book cover to cover in about 2 hours! 90% of the pages are full of screen shots. It glossed over synchronization, and also use with a Palm Pilot or CE device. If you are purely a user that wants to make ACT work at the most basic of levels, I guess this book would be OK. I went to a Brick & Mortar bookstore and looked at the other Act books. Special Edition Using Act 2000 looks *much* better. I've bought tons of stuff at Amazon and never returned a thing, but I think I'll return this book and buy Special Edition."
3,Fast & Easy It Is But Doesn't Go Into Explainations,"If this is your first time with ACT! the book is good. It gives a screen by screen description of what keys to push. But if you have any problems, this book will not help. For instance, if you are importing a database into ACT! and don't know if it is a .txt or .dbf file you're up a creek."
4,Valuable book,"When Ronald Nash stated that this book had caused him to re-think some of his conclusions, I was interested. Amos did not disappoint. If you have only read the standard views of the Declaration, you really should read this."
1,Such BS,"Amos's agenda is obvious. He went into he writing of this book with preset, small-minded ideas, and it shows. His world would expand greatly if he would but open his eyes."
4,A good first album,"Miss Buck has done a fine job singing the big band music I started with. It is a good first effort. I hope her next work is not live, but in a studio for the entire production. Miss Buck and Mr Jones show a lot of sincerity for the big band era."
1,Not Exceptional,"Ms. Abbe Buck tries her best here. Sadly, her best is not good enough.The vocals range from unexceptional to overly cute. In paying homage to ""songs of a bygone era,"" Ms. Buck brings us nothing new. At times, even the other musicians on the disc sound bored (Seems like Old Times).If the tunes on this album are your cup of tea, stick to the originals (RoseMary Clooney, Judy Garland, etc.)."
4,jamesderrick@pobox.com,"I used this series to relearn Latin over a few months. It is an intense course, with even pages providing grammar, and odd pages consisting of exercises. Each grammar page covers a variety of topics. Because it is so condensed, it is possible to progress rapidly which is very motivating. The author's style is entertaining, which also helps to maintain interest.It is vital to learn everything thoroughly as you go, or you will be rapidly overwhelmed. The books focus primarily on written language rather than spoken. I personally would have found more exercises useful - especially in Book III Perhaps a supplementary book could be considered for future publication.Having finished the books, I am now able read Caesar and the Vulgate Bible with the help of a dictionary. I am not able to compare the books with other Latin texts, however the series is one of the best I have used for self study of a foreign language."
5,Great Latin Textbook,"I bought this because my daughter finished the 3 disc Rosetta Stone Latin series and wanted to continue. It's a solid basic Latin grammar and textbook. Not cutesy, well organized, not religious, rigorous but not too complicated. Highly recommended!"
1,North Fork,North Fork arived at the right time and it was in good shape. I purchased it from Amazon. I was very pleased with this purchase.
5,PORTER CABLE SANDER FINALLY REPAIRED.,"IF YOU NEED A REPLACEMENT PAD FOR YOUR PORTER CABLE RANDOM ORBIT SANDER BUY IT, YOU CAN'T BEAT THE PRICE."
4,Interesting book,"I had to purchase this book for a School Law class I was taking for my graduate degree. Although we were only required to read a certain chapter to present, I found myself reading more than the required- especially after hearing presentations each week. This book gives snid-bits of court cases for various categories.. it definitely explains why some things are the way they are in schools. Most the cases are from pretty old, so my one critique is that I wish it had more recent cases since education has changed so much over time."
2,I think there are better books to use,"This book is not for the person just getting an intiation into school law. It is too condense and only gives blurbs of the verdicts in each case by quoting the appellate and US supreme court judges which are oft times convoluted, the author leaves out an indepth explanation of the nuts and bolts. I refer to this book as the Reader's Digest version of school law. Also, the print is microscopic which is really hard on the eyes."
4,School Law Book,I found the book to be affordable (compared to the price of a new text) and it has been very useful in my graduate class. It also arrived within a very reasonable amount of time.
4,Well written about case subject,"Law book need to be understood by the lay person that is not a lawyer, but those that are in some type of law need to be able to understand the law, an be able understand the common law."
4,BLONDES BEWARE!,"In CHOSEN PREY, average-looking Professor James Qatar appreciates the finer things that life offers, such as art, history, designer clothes, photography, and beautiful, blond women. Unfortunately, for most of the women with whom he becomes involved, his ultimate goal is to kill them.As woman after woman is reported missing in a large metropolitan area, and then one is found murdered, the police begin to connect the disappearances. Head honcho for the case is Investigator Lucas Davenport, who quickly becomes consumed with finding this maniacal average Joe. Davenport's task seems almost impossible because it appears that the killer is able to be invisible in plain sight and he's leaving amazingly few clues.This is a real page-turner, done in the style of the James Patterson novel, where the reader knows the killer's identity from the beginning. The drama and suspense come with each missed opportunity and the potential for further mayhem."
2,BAD ACTING,The story line was ok hence the 2 stars..BUT the acting and directing and everything else about this movie sucks.!!!!It looks like its done by unskilled-bad-untalented amatures..even the way it was shot..looks like a bad B-Movie shot in the 70s!!!!!!!!!Dont be fooled by the dvd cover!
4,Very practical guide,A collection of 37 articles that promises to reconnect the reader with his/her inner child. The book starts with describing the archetype of the inner child. The book then goes on to describe problems with the inner child. The finally the book offers suggestions with getting in touch with your own inner child. A valuable book with good information for any parent.
5,No one can stay grumpy while listening to Gyspy Jazz,"Where there's music, romance and adventure are never completely out of reach. I highly recommend BE That Way(Panda Digital) , the latest collection of intoxicating Gyspsy jazz from the Hot Club of San Francisco. Inspired by storied Belgian guitarist Django Reinhardt's landmark recordings from the 30's and 40's, the all-acoustic quintet (bass, violin and three guitars) excels at creating carefree cafe atmosphere in the least likely of places -my toy and crmpb-strewn living room, for example.Be That Way is the groups' second album of all-original tunes by Oakland-based guitarist/composer Paul Mehling, ranges from rouguisly rambuncitons ('Pazzo's Fifth', the title tune ""Be That Way"" ) to whimsical (""Waltz Magique"" co-written with longtime Hot Club associate Dan Hicks) to making-out-in-the-moonlight mellow (""Pas de Trois"" - ""It's Not Exactly a Sonata for Renata""). And those mischievous song titles? Dont't even get me started. www.HCSF.com"
3,Use with care,"These seem to vary in quality and because I have 3 PC333 sanders, I am buying these fairly frequently. My problems have been the screws too and the washers will help but I have also had the rubber pad disintegrate pretty quickly on some of the replacements. The sanders are used in a similar way for woodworking and automotive work so they are getting a workout but they are not abused. The original pads lasted for years and now I feel lucky if they last months so I am trying to use much less pressure when sanding, especially with 60 or 80 grit."
1,replacement is not same as original,"The screws stripped right through the hardened-plastic backing of the pad. I noticed that the part number on this item was slightly different from the original when I was replacing it: 13904 (original part), 13905( this part). The original had a metal backing on the pad. Live and learn....."
1,Pad disengaged from sander,"The screw heads, which hold the pad in place, wore through the plastic after about 90 minutes of use. The holes should have reinforcement of some kind stronger than the plastic that is used.I will be returning the pads."
3,its ok,i ordered this thinking it would work for id cards. its a luggage tag. overall its ok . came with some plastic strips
3,poorly made mask,"Got this for my 3 year old. The costume is what you would expect, but the mask is pretty unfortunate. Elastic tore threw the mask after 2nd or 3rd wearing. Not worth it."
1,dont buy this,this movie wasted my time and money this movie really (stinks) the actors cant act the story line is stupid and there is nood gang fights it deserved two stars because of the violence but thats all that was good
2,Bad but funny,I had to give it 2 stars because it was bad but funny. The three characters that they have on the cover are not even in the movie. Three highly dangerous hitman agree to be paid by check to kill a witness? Really? If you don't take this movie too seriously you'll enjoy it.
5,High-energy music for a high-energy movie,"I waited to buy the soundtrack until I'd seen ""Run Lola Run,"" and then I HAD to have it--by which time, of course, there were none to be found. I'm told patience is a virtue and I, therefore, must be quite virtuous. I now have the soundtrack, and it's most excellent to work out to, write poetry to...damn near do anything to (insert sexual innuendo here). I could have done without the endless remixes, but the main cuts from the movie are so good that I don't really care that the album is about twice as long as it needs to be. A soundtrack that's as good as the movie it's from--and considering how excellent ""Run Lola Run"" is, that's high praise indeed."
3,Same three songs again and again and again,"Like others, I saw the movie ""Run Lola Run"" and loved the music! I straightaway ordered it from Amazon once it was available and listened to it several times in my car. While it's a fun record, this feels like the whole soundtrack is made up of three songs, remixed slightly over and over. After a couple of times, you're quite sick of it! I really like the first ""Running Two"" and ""Running Three"" songs, so the CD is worth buying for those alone, but I don't think has the depth and breadth that deserves the 5 star rating others have given it."
4,Techno for those who don't like to sit still.,"Anyone who listens to techno knows that it can get repetitive, but that still doesn't detract from the quality of this CD. It's absolutely perfect for this movie and anyone who listens to techno. The beat keeps you going and messes with your head. Close your eyes and you can see a Lola running with her orange hair flaming behind her. It's a rush, and go buy the movie, too. Don't be afraid of something that's subtitled. And see why Franke Potente (Lola) is a portrait of physical fitness in this movie. She RUNS."
5,Excellent driving music,"This is the excellent soundtrack to an excellent film. The entire time I was watching the movie, I was telling myself to pick up the soundtrack afterwards, and I'm glad I did. Not too hard, not too repetetive, and great for driving down long, empty roads..."
5,Hyperactive,It is impossible to imagine a more appropriate soundtrack for Run Lola Run. It is the driving force behind the whole movie. If these tracks can make a movie with no solid plot great just imagine what it could do for taking a walk around your neighborhood. You will have to be careful not to walk so fast that you hurt yourself. This is probably one of my top three soundtracks (and I have a lot of them so I know what I'm talking about). I highly recomend this CD.
3,Not quite,"There are perhaps two KILLER tracks on this album. The problem is that they're spread out over 15 tracks. Bits of bone-grooving music pop up here and there, but nothing is sustained. This weakness of the music was well-hidden by the film, but comes out on the CD. I loved the movie, and it's the same genre as the music: unsophisticated, hollow, total fun. Just don't expect much depth, to the fun either."
3,Remix Overload,"If you liked Run Lola Run the movie and lets face it, who doesn't, then you should like this soundtrack too, well at least half of it that is.For a pure music CD there are just too many remixes. However if getting hold of the the three or four awesome tracks that are heard during the movie is a must, then the CD is still worth it."
4,Music to get your blood pumping,"I've had this CD for about a year now, and it's still my favorite exercise CD, hands down. The pace really gets you going, and although I'm not usually a techno fan, I love it. Nothing gets me running quite so fast as this one!"
5,"Energetic and Pulsating, Great!",This album is the best Techno CD I have ever purchased! If your are a die hard techno fan you must get this!
2,Fast,"This is some fast music. This CD is almost like the movie, but you hear the same song 6 different ways. This isn't really worth the whole album. A single would be a better purchase-if they sell it."
1,For the love of God and sake of humanity! ...,"Ok, I saw the trailer...I liked what I heard enough to go andlook for the soundtrack...found the soundtrack here on Amazon.com,listened to the samples and thought...CLASS! it was to be everything I wanted..an ENTIRE ost based on Techno/Chemical tunez......Then it came, I was GROSSLY dissapointed!It has all the right elements to make it a great CD, but it is let down by bad direction and a huge dose of deja-vu with every track that you hear...My advice...Let someone else buy it first, then listen to it for yourself!"
1,I am unhappy with the quality of this CD,"This is a first for me. I bought this CD cheap, but when it came the tracks just wouldn't read. I have to skip tracks forever and then one will kick in for a while. There is nothing wrong with my player, just this seller. I didn't try to get another due to the price I paid, but maybe I will now. This is one of my favorite movies/soundtracks of all time. It is an introduction to the knowledge one will store exponentially from life experience, as long as they live."
4,Great Movie and Soundtrack,I saw this movie the other night and when I heard the storyline I thought 'how can they make this movie with a 20 minute timeline to deliver the money?' With the twists and turns and the accurate attention to detail on the detail and cinemagraphic contributions this movie was wonderful.It is subtitled in German but easy to follow. Great movie. Wonderful soundtrack. Great attention to detail. Great actors. It has won several indie type awards (so I hear).I'm not a DVD buyer for most mainstream movies but this is one I have added to my list.
4,"Loved the movie, love the soundtrack","Probably THE best soundtrack CD to any movie ever. All those awesome high-energy songs from the film are here. It's just awesome. I love listening to this when running.My one drawback - and I am curious if anyone else hears this - During the track ""Introduction"" I hear this totally distracting noise like someone lightly tapping on a hand drum - 1-2. 3. 4. Over and over again - 1-2, 3. 4. Now, I know for a fact that this noise is NOT in the movie - I have checked my DVD and that song sounds perfect - it's my favorite of them all. But for whatever reason - there's this totally annoying and distracting sound throughout the entire song. Drives me nuts and ruins it for me."
3,Soundtrack album from RUN LOLA RUN,"If you have watched the wonderful movie of RUN LOLA RUN (""LOLA RENNT"" in German), this CD will bring back happy memories of the hypnotic pace and movie soundtrack.However, if you have not seen the movie, I believe this CD may puzzle or disappoint, because you would not making the vital connections between the movie action and the tunes."
4,Hold on to Your CD Players...,"I am NOT a techno fan, but I do uphold the theory, ""When it's good, it's good."" This music, which effectively energized nearly every scene in ""Run Lola Run"", does an equally exhilarating job as a stand-alone album. If you're seeking an adrenaline rush (and some catchy, ""get-out-of-your-chair-and-dance-around-the-room-in-front-of-the-mirror"" rhythms), pick this one up. You won't be disappointed."
2,"liked the movie, not the soundtrack","Repetitive like Moby=OK, but the same repetitive song done with slight variations on several tracks? No thanks! I really liked this movie because of its creative ""alternative outcomes"". The main song on the soundtack rocks. The only problem is that there are not enough songs in the movie to warrant a full soundtrack. To overcome this, some genius decided to fill the CD with too many remixes of the same song; thereby ruining it for you forever!"
3,Repition,"The movie Run Lola Run, totally rocks, and I'm only 16, and I don't speak a word of it's native language. However, I thought the movie was soo good, that I had to run out and buy the Sountrack as well, *(hehe, i made a bootleg copy of the movie.) Anyway, i give you one word, REPITION, the sounds and techno beat are great, but it just keeps repeating it's self, the songs are origional, but the song it's self is just copying it's self over and over again.. can get a bit boring..."
3,Its not fast paced at all !!,"After reading the reviews, i was expecting a fast paced/hardcore soundtrack, but as soon as i got it i realized that its not fast paced at all, its very slow trance. Rock Me, by Pills, track #16 was the only song i actually enjoyed, the rest, pardon the language, s**ked"
4,Excellent and invigorating,A really great CD that literally propels you into a state of energy and excitement. There are a couple different versions of the same songs on this CD but it doesn't feel repetitive. I especially like the song sung by Franka Potente (Lola) herself.Terrific Eurodance stuff!
5,Great CD,"Yes, repetetive, but that is the nature of soundtracks. This has enough twists to make it really interesting. It's upbeat and sexy. Love it."
4,Run Lola Run Anecdote,"Today at soccer practice we had to run a lot. I'm the goalie so I'm usually dead last. But today I had the third track stuck in my head and I finished in the middle of the pack. I ran so hard that I found myself in the early stages of heat stroke. Of course, that wasn't the CD's fault; I wasn't drinking any water and it was ninety degrees. So buy the CD, run, and make sure to get plenty of fluids.Note: If listening to Run Lola Run in the car, put the car in cruise control or else you're begging for a speeding ticket."
4,Pharmacutical corporation in dirty dealings shock,This book is initially quite a complex and interwoven story dealing with a series of characters and situations connected with genetics and pharmacuticals. Each of these develops into an absorbing amalgamation of the central theme and until the middle of the book this works and I certainly couldn't put it down. A smattering of the occult graces the pages from beginning to end and this may be enough to get you through but by the end a familiar and somewhat cliched parody of many books of the same ilk becomes evident. Enkoyable enough but prepare for disappointment and a little frustration
5,really great entertainment !,"this book definitely is one of my favorite holiday recommendations: a thrilling crime story, embedded in an interesting occult context and completed as a love story. You won't miss anything and enjoy it all!"
5,I love the groove option.,If you dont already have one of these you should get one. I never use the headphones that came with it(Optimus is nicer) but the portable cd player is really great. The groove option makes bands sound like what they are:bands. You should be careful not to drop it and even if the thing does break you can just use a regular stereo.
2,Great...Until it breaks!!!,"This is a really great CD player until it breaks!! I've had it for about 2-3 years and all the features are really excellent. The headphones are nice and it's generally easy to use. A few months ago the LCD screen started to go, which was a big pain because it is really hard to adjust the volume and the what song you're on. One day I tried to turn it on and it wouldn't go. I tried new battteries, hooking it up to the wall, etc. It just died. Now I'm really mad because it was expensive and only served 2-3 years. Come on Sony-this is just cheap!!!"
2,Good CD Player....until it breaks!!!,"I had an updated version of this Sport CD Player (the one that was out as of 11/00)..I give it two stars rather then ONE because it did have a lot of power (volume) and the thing really didn't skip while jogging...BUT it eventually gave out after only 7 months of using it. This is a [expensive]CD player....and to fix it was going to cost an unbelievable $150!!!! It needed a new laser. I have to say that EVERYTHING I have EVER bought by SONY (TV, Walkman, VCR, CAMCORDER etc) has ALWAYS BROKEN at least once. I think this will be my LAST SONY product..."
5,Angelina Ballerina - Friends Forever,Gave this to my granddaughters for Christmas and they enjoy it while playing with their Angelina Ballerina Dolls. Thanks!
3,No menu makes this impossible to navigate,"While my daughter enjoys watching the episodes, it is frustrating when she wants to see the live action segments at the end. There is no menu in order to skip over the cartoon episodes and go straight to the live action.Basically, we have to skip each chapter until we get to the last chapter in an episode (the DVD won't let you skip the last chapter), wait for the episode to end, and then do the same process for each of the remaining episodes until you reach the live action.It seems like the makers of the DVD just recorded the VHS version onto disc and left it at that."
2,we did not open it,As they had experienced problems with the two other dvd's that i had purchased my daughter-in-law decided to return this dvd unopened.
4,Cute Story,Great story for little girls. I bought this as a Christmas gift and my cousin loves this book. I think I'll buy more for her. Great price.
2,nice look but not comfortable,It is really really hard to pull on and take off them. NOT comfortable while 10-minite-above walk.
1,THIS IS THE WORST RADIO I HAVE EVER OWNED.,I Bought This Radio Because I Thought Kenwood Makes The Best Radio Products.Until I Bought This Peice Of Junk.First Of All The Material To This Radio Is Easily Breakable.Second The Screen Never Turnes Off Its Always Moving Around And Telling You About Options Almost Like A Robot Never Lets Me Sleep.And Finally It Does'nt Thump Like I Thought It Would.I Have Always Liked Kenwood Products But This One Just Was'nt What I Was Looking For In A Kenwwood Product......................
2,Not Worth Such a Price,"The boots bottom are made of poor quality gel & rubber, uncomfortable, almost get me fell on the ground several times on solid surfaces like granite. Can't walk a lot with it because the bottom layer is thin and solid, with no soft interior layers. When I run with the boots, my feet hurts, and make a lot of noise like beating the floor with a piece of rubber. I expected more than this with the price I paid. At least the size is fit for my feet, and the design for toes isn't bad, and the black color didn't fade away when washed----that's reason I'm giving 2 stars."
3,Okay for the money,"They're quite comfortable, but the velcro used to strap them on doesn't allow for much adjustment. This is my first pair of tabis, so I wasn't expecting velcro. I've only seen ones that lace up in the back of the boot. Would much have preferred that. Again, they're comfortable, but I wouldn't recommend any rope climbing with them on, even though that's what they were originally designed for. 3 stars for sentimental value and comfort. But an obviously cheaply made product."
4,Made me happy,I bought these to complete my ninja outfit for Halloween and was pretty satasfied. i wore them comfortably with normal socks. I only wish that they were a bit tighter around my legs.
2,Not sold as advertised.,"The boot in the picture has the grooves which pretty much define the Tabi boot, allowing wall climbing manuevers and such. The boot I received had a flat bottom and gave almost no grip. Tennis shoes work better."
4,Not the best fit-but the price is unbeatable,"You absolutely must get these a size smaller than you want. Also note there is generally a good bit of extra space toward the top. I overcame this by lacing mine up in place of the velcro. Soles are nice, not too a heavy patter, not too soft, have decent traction, great toe grip, can feel through the bottom pretty well (which is important with tabi).All in all you can't beat what you get for the price, soon as mine came I ran straight outback to test them-practically ran up the oak tree when I got there too! I have homemade all leather tabi but, I wanted these for training and rope climbing exercises. Love them so far.Thanks Amazon!"
3,"Its good, but not great...","They were quite comfortable on my feet, even after long hours walking with them on. But I thought they were going to be slip-resistant. They are not. I'm using them around the house, but need to find a work pair"
5,Rocker,"Purchased this in white, then I sent an e-mail at the last part when I purchased online. I asked for green. The package arrived within a few short days and the chair was GREEN!!! I was very happy. Was easy to put together, just put liquid soap on the groove parts and slid in very easy, gave it an extra push and it went into place easy. I ENCOURAGE others to purchase this product, I will buy another one here for a Christmas present for my sister. Its a nice big seat and high back and will hold over 300 lbs!!!"
4,All Resin Rocking Chair is just great!,"Patio Rocking ChairThis all resin chair has no fasteners to rust, sturdy construction, just what I was looking for!"
5,A great outdoor chair.,"I was glad I finally found this chair. It is sturdy, and best of all, it is made to be left outside. You don't have to worry about protecting it like the equally expensive wooden rockers that are out there, and not as sturdy I might add. It was easy to put together. It's only 4 parts that slide together. No screws or hardware. Totally worth the price. I'm very happy with it."
3,durable rocker,Have these for a while now. My husband likes them more than I do. They are different..a little big !! We have them on our outside patio so it's ok. We had trouble putting them together. If I had it to do all over I would have chosen something else. That's just me. He thinks they are ok !
4,resin patio rocking chairs,"I bought 2 of these chairs for my front porch. While they are ruggedchairs that clearly will stand up to outdoor use, the angle of the back makessitting in them ok but not great. It took contacting the company, to find outwhy there was a delay in shipping them. No answer, they just arrived a monthafter I ordered them and less than a week after I questioned ""delay"".Assembly was inconsistent. The first chair went together smooth as silk,while the second chair seemed slightly warped and required a struggle to makethe grooves align. All in all, they were markedly less expensive than othersthat I considered, and I think they were worth the money."
4,A sweet Christmas story!,"As simple and predictable this story was, I genuinely enjoyed it! Whether it was Sherryl Woods' delightful style of writing, or the charming rural Vermont setting, or the hunky and oh so nice male protagonist, this story really came alive off the pages. Yes...Chelsea was kind of bratty, and Beth was too skittish, but it was all part of their healing and learning to love/trust again. Very nice holiday story!"
3,"Not bad, could have been better","I agree with the previous review, and also generously grant it 3 stars. The kid in question acts more like a moron than someone with a purpose in his visit to Buenos Aires - and it's not necesarily to meet Sabrina Love, the porn star he won a night of ""fun"" with. As with the typical Argentine movie, the inevitable old Italian man is there, this time, as unexplicably the husband of Sabrina Love, who is the producer of her show, and is of the jealous type, but has money. The boy gets to mee SL, and have a night of fun with her. he also gets to know her on a deeper level, but cannot, or will not grow up. The movie gets even more irritating as he fails to share with his city older brother, the real news about their parents. The film had a promising start, but as with the rest of Argentina, it was all a terrible waste."
3,A night that became boring,"Although the film is not horrible, I felt rather dissapointed when I saw it. The script and plot had potential. The story is very interesting and it is about a boy who, after winning a contest, must make his way to Buenos Aires to meet the famous porn star Sabrina Love. He learns things about himself and others during his journey. Although the story was very interesting, the execution of the film failed in that the movie became tedious, not well edited and a bit boring. Even Cecilia Roth could not save this movie. Her performance, although not her best, is so much better than the movie. In conclusion, it is not a bad film, but it could have been better had the plot held together better and had better editting."
5,I read this book in 3 days great reading start to finish.,Eugene Izzi outdid himself with this book.I could not put it down. The story line just kept getting better with each and every page. A must read for any Izzi fan.
3,"grim, depressing but absorbing mystery","Although this book is well-written and suspenseful, I only gave it three stars because of the unrelenting grimness of it. Everybody in this book is mentally, physically or emotionally unstable due to alcohol abuse, drug abuse, child abuse, mental illness, etc. It's tough to read something like this without getting really depressed yourself. Sometimes the ending redeems the rest of the book, but not in this case. I found it just as depressing as the rest of the book. The book reminded me a bit of the movie Seven because of the goriness of the crimes and the cocky attitude of the lead detective. Although (thank God) not as gruesome as it could be, this book is still not for the faint of heart."
5,being yourself,"I, REALLY LIKED THIS MOVIE ALOT!! THIS MOVIE WAS REALLY GREAT AND I, LOVE MOVIES THAT ARE ABOUT SOMEONE FINDING HIS/HERSELF."
2,"Wrong movie in the Box, when i opened the DVD titled an Unexpected Love on the cover, on the inside the disk was Love Notes!",This was an okay predictable light hearted love story......nothing like what I orderd! I was very disappointed to receive the wrong film and because i had to open the cover to discover...I did not return.
3,Maybe 3 1/2,"The guitar concerto here is excellent--fine performance by all, excellent production and balance for the solo instrument against the orchestra. The same is true for the piano concerto, except that it is not one of Ponce's better large-scale works. Again, the quality of the recording is very good on the violin concerto, but the performance is somewhat flat and lacking in expression. It has beauty, no doubt, but not nearly what it could. I imagine that a violinist more sympathetic to Ponce's soundworld might produce better results. If this had been a bargain CD, I would have given 4 stars out of gratitude for the effort, but the guitar concerto is the only one here given the attention it deserves on a full-priced recording."
3,You have to be a real Pearl Jam fan-atic!,"I had a few free CDs to redeem at Columbia House and this was available as a free selection.I like their studio albums, although the latter ones can't seem to grab me that much. They're a bit boring, there's nothing new, nothing exciting on them.I did actually promote some of their shows in Eastern Europe in 1996 and 1998. I liked them live. This is the only CD I've heard from all of the concert recordings that they've kept releasing in the last two years. I don't like it.The sound quality is poor. Somehow, if you're not there, it doesn't give you back the energy that comes off stage. It seems boring. I can't really explain this. Something was lacking. I think you really have to be a die-hard fanatic to buy any or all of these concert releases. I will give another one or two a try, but I really don't think they're going to be any better. I have serious problems with the mixing and the sound quality compared to other live recordings."
4,A fascinating read but somewhat dated,"I found this book on my grandmother's bookshelf, and I couldn't put it down. It nows stays with me. The authors bring scientific reasoning to bear on some of the most enduring past mysteries - Who first crossed the oceans, where did homer's heroes come from, how has climate affected history, etc. - and give incredibly intriguing answers. Alas, many of them are not the latest science anymore, but many of these mysteries still remain unsolved and the arguments in the book still remain valid. All in all, it's worth reading simply for the intellectual joy of the speculations offered, regardless of their outdated status."
5,Different Publisher,"The book that goes with this ISBN was actually published by the American Heritage Publishing Co. of New York and is labeled Book Trade Distribution by Simon and Schuster. It is the regular, not the deluxe edition. The authors are Casson, Claiborne, Fagan and Karp. The editor is Thorndike. It is possible that another edition also was given this ISBN. Sometimes the ISBN's aren't very distinctive."
4,If you could only have one astrology book.....,"When I began studying astrology, my teacher made a very bold statement. She believed that to be an effective astrologer all you really needed was an ephemeris and a copy of ""An Astrological Mandala"". That may be stretching it a little bit, however, I do find it most handy when preparing a client's chart. I'm now on my second copy, having worn out the first one from constant use!It is interesting and informative to consider the Sabian Symbol when evaluating a chart.I do consider this book a very valuable resource in my astrological library."
3,Good but esoteric recommendation from a friend,"A friend wanted to do a star chart for me. He told me to hunt down this book in order to understand what the chart said once he finished it. It's easy to read. It explains things pretty well. But, then again, I needed my friend to help me understand correlations from one end to the other. You can tell that the writer is very enthusiastic from his generalizations and how they are grouped together. However, this is not a book that you can go through by yourself. It definitely requires a second set of eyes.Oh, and in case you're wondering if my chart was accurate based on the author's cycles. Extremely accurate!!"
5,A Key to Understanding,"this is a truly great book...dear seekers after truth,... and we've had our copy for over 30 years and use it periodically. It not only illuminates the zodiac as a whole but can be used to help one understand the individual aspects of one's own chart (for instance, one can look up the location of mars in one's chart and see the symbolic imagery associated with it) but these elves also devised a means of using it as an oracle, which proved to be quite accurate, as well as, using it in association with magic workings we do. It is a profound work, helping one understand the larger forces that affect our lives and move us ever onward in our development as spirits with souls.kyela,the silver elves[...]"
1,Very cryptic explanation. No practical usage.,"The explanation in this book is very cryptic. Hence, it provides no practical usage.For example, on page 252, phase 306, Aquarius 6 degree: A masked figure performs ritualistic acts in a mystery play.The author's explanation is like this ""KEY NOTE: The individual involvement's in long established patterns of activities aiming at the release of collective power.""If anybody who can understand this and successfully applies this to his/her daily activities, I would like to be tutored by you.What a waste of money!"
5,Buy degrees of the zodiac by hansen,"This is the most esoteric and boring book i've ever bought.I regret I can't return it but I can throw it away. Look for a book that is specific.Like,5 deg gemini,then an interpretation in simple everyday english. If I could give you my copy I would.they probably won't put this out at amazon but if they do respect em by buying degrees of the zodiac by someone else. I am waiting for hansen so I can't give an opinion yet."
4,Less abstract than many,"Not as abstract as many linear algebra books, with less emphasis on proof and more on understanding how the pieces fit together."
5,"Great, Easy Workout","Not a huge workout fan, but Kathy makes it easy and fun. It changed my life overnight. I lost 5 pounds in the first week. Kudos Kathy!!!"
2,Rosy memories,"Ms. Solomon's quest for identity takes half-steps and wears rose-colored glasses. Hers is a unique story for those of us not raised by a religious fundamentalist committed to hierarchy, progeny, and lack of responsibility. She keeps reassuring readers that this man is devoted to love and God, although he ignores the needs of his family to gratify only needs of his own. The fact that his children have to rummage through dumpsters to find food for wives and children while he schemes against polygamist rivals is OK with her. She can't get past ""us"" against ""them,"" the chosen--this happy little band of outcasts--against the great unwashed. I read the whole story with increasing disappointment."
2,Today,"Just so you know - members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormons) who are known to practice polygomy are excommunicated from the church and are not members, anymore. They may continue to practice what they claim to be Mormonism in their homes and call themselves ""Mormon"" to others in society, but they are stricken from the records of the church and usually do not attend church meetings, anymore, unless they are trying to change their ways and come back unto Christ. True Mormons adhere by the prophets' teachings and do not practice polygomy today.I feel sorry for the poor woman who wrote this story. It shames me that such twisted people claim to be Mormons and turn so many away from the church."
3,"I agree with ""Rosy Memories""","I thought the book was disappointing. She is a good writer but the overwhelming whitewash of her father was a turn-off. The focus of the book seemed to be simply the surface of her life and the surface of the religion, and near the end I started skipping pages to get to something interesting. I really didn't understand if she wanted sympathy for this lifestyle or was trying to explain it.Her fathers wives certainly needed sympathy, but I could find no real hardship in her growing up despite her whining about not getting enough attention from her dad.Unfortunately I know too many folks whose childhood would make hers look like Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm to have any sympathy for her at all. Strange it may have been, deprived it certainly was not."
1,Not as expected,"This is just ""more of the same"" from her other book. As a matter of fact, it's almost an exact repeat. Save your money - don't bother."
3,"Predators, Prey, and Other Kinfolk: Growing Up in Polygamy","It was interesting to me. I have known the family for over 40 years and most of what is said is good, however, she has taken quite a bit of poetic license and exagerated to get more readers interested. The Title is an example."
3,Pretty Predictable,"This wasn't exactly the worst book in the series, but it definitely wasn't the best. For starters, this whole plot was soooooo predictable. I was in the middle of the book when i predicted the end. I was right, except for that they were twins instead of brothers. Next, didn't Ashleigh's parents repeatedly say they were not going to race? Then, what's up with not racing Renegade? He hasn't got the best track record, so you'd think that they'd race him a few more times before retiring him so that trainers would want to breed their mares with him. One really really really good thing about this book is Stardust's baby! I can't wait to see him/her! Some names: Royal Star, Stardust's Renegade, etc."
1,Worst book in the ashliegh series,...this book was predictable... I liked the first part but not the middle or end.
1,YUCK!!!,This has to be the worst book ever published in the TB series. I am a huge TB fan and I've read all of the books in the series. This book is just exasperating. I knew from the beginning everything in this book and it was just plain painful to read. I'm glad that this was not Joanna Campbell's writing because I would have been amazed if she could write something this bad. I'm just outraged that this book was published in my favorite series. :-(
1,Derby Nightmares,"This book is HORRIBLE!What ever happened to Aladdn?Wonder? I though Ashleigh thought Aladdin was the greatest horse.Then she thinks Wonder is the greatest horse.In this very bad book,she said that Renegade is the most perfect horse ever.OH PLEASE!She thought the same about dozens of horses before.This book needs a reality check.No horse that some people bought for a low price is going to win the SPIRAL STAKES!!!!!Let alone the Derby!!It really annoys the heck out of me how the authors come up with all of these stupid things.All these new horses who Ashleigh falls in loves with and says they're so perfect!"
3,umblahgeayaeda.....sure,"Well, this book was well written, I'll give them that, but it seems like it belongs in a whole different series.It was just very predictable. I figured out what was going on even before it even dawned on Ashleigh.One last thing. I wish the people would STOP contradicting the things that they say happened it books 1-5. I mean... you get confused.."
1,repulsive,book such as these continue the myth that homosexuality is wrong - it is sad to think some people still believe this nonsense.
5,One of the best shows on TV!,"This is one of my husband's favorite TV shows and I'm glad that it came out on dvd so quickly after the season ended. It is one of those shows that doesn't try to hard to be funny, but makes light of the humor of the everyday family life."
5,LOVE THIS SHOW....LOVE AMAZON!,"We have become huge fans of Modern Family, we purchased Season 1 & 2. Hilarious comedy...all of the characters are so funny! We would suggest everyone watch it! Love the convenience of shopping with Amazon...my shopping place for most holidays!"
5,SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FUNNY,I LOVE THIS I LOVE THIS SO SO GOOD YOU WILL NOT WANT TO STOP WATCHING THIS IT'S SO FUNNY AND GOT GOOD FAMILY THINGS THAT MAKE YOU THINK.
5,Modern Family is a great show,"Every season of this show is great, season 2 is no exception. Just down right hilarious. My favorite show on TV."
5,Let the good times roll,"The first season of Modern Family was hilarious. Sometimes one worries if the humor will continue into the second season. The writers for this sitcom have not let us down - they continue to write funny plots, many of which also have morals or other take home messages. I applaud the producers of this sitcom for what they are doing to bring good humor and family values back into the home."
5,great comedy,"This show is one of the most entertaining to come along in quite a while. It's clever, creative and the characters very endearing. We have never seen one show that we didn't laugh out loud. The humor is smart, not slap in the face stupid. If it doesn't make you laugh out loud or at least smile you probably hate Christmas, puppies and babies and "" grumpy cynic"" is your middle name. (You know the type) For the rest of you ENJOY!!"
4,Great show,"This is a great show, but this season was a little lacking. It's still good and worth getting and seeing."
5,Best sitcom ever,Modern Family has excellent writers. The show is well casted. It is a show I look forward to each week. This and Seinfeld are the only TV shows in our home theater library.
5,Funny and entertaining,"After seeing seeing season 1 from the Library, I knew I had to get the season series on DVD. The best show on TV."
1,Widescreen vs. regular DVD,"I ordered both Season 1 and Season 2 of Modern Family (as Christmas gifts). Season 1 appears to be a normal format, however I did return a ""Widescreen Edition"" of Season 2 for a regular format DVD (as the Season 1 was). I was again sent a Widescreen Version of Season 2. I give up. Isn't there a non-widescreen version of Season 2. Who wants to keep returning to the Post Office at this time of year. Not happy."
1,2/3 of it Does Not Work,"Dear Seller,I was severely unsatisfied with the product (Modern Family Season 2) that you sold me. I love the show, and since it is not on Netflix and I am a poor college student, I decided to purchase it for less on Amazon.com. I was extremely excited when I popped in the first disc, only to learn that it was ""unrecognized"" by the player. Not wanting my disappointments to get the best of me, I thought positively and inserted the second disc. It worked to my enjoyment and I watched all the episodes on that disc. However, when I put in the final disc of the season, it also was unrecognizable. So in short, I am unhappy that I am unable to watch one of my favorite shows after paying for season 2.Sincerely,Disgruntled"
1,TV In The 10's,"Pathetic and unfunny. They're all dumbed down, politically correct stereotypes of what they're portrayed as, and they're all pathetic at that. They're all upper-middle class snobs always bitching about something, something a normal person could easily avoid, ""by thinking"". The heterosexual male is the weakest link of the show which is typical for it's time. The females are all dressed like ""uniform prostitutes"", also typical. In a time when gays and feminist women have invaded the media I wasn't expecting anything good but I wasn't expecting it to be this low and degradingly stupid. This DVD shouldn't be allowed near children, avoid like the plague."
5,"Fast shipment, perfect quality",My order arrived when it was supposed to and in perfect condition. The DVD box was still in the plastic and there were no tears or any damages. Very happy with this purchase!
2,I will never order another used DVD however (the Season was my favorite season so far),"After viewing other reviews. The product review has to do with a review of the quality of the DVD and the quality of the movie. The star ratings are assigned to the seller. A lot of the sellers have different star ratings. Otherwise sellers can get away with sending buyers low quality dvds.The season itself was so far my favorite season.As I indicated in my previous review:The second disk of the second season that I order has a bad area on it. Unfortnately the episodes on the second DVD disk is the reason I order the second season. During a couple of the episodes, the picture moves really slow and afterwards freezes. It is very irritating. If you have a DVD set that has a bad disk you should not sell it to someone. I will never buy another used DVD set because of something like this happening. It's not worth the savings."
1,Bought for someone else,I hate this show - SORRY . It for doing nothing when there is nothing better to do . My daughter made me purchase this for her friend .
4,Funny,"When is this show not funny? Well not as much as the first season but definitely has some knee-slappers. I'm not sure if the writers are already running out of ""real life"" to inspire the show but we'll see where this second season takes us !"
5,Love this show!,This is one of the funniest shows on tv!!! You won't go wrong getting this DVD set!!!! Buy it now!
3,"DVD's came quick, but inside of case was broken","I received the second season of Modern Family very quickly. The only downside is when my girlfriend opened up the inside of the case (it was a birthday gift), the casing that held the DVD's together was broken."
5,Awsome,This show is hilarious!!!! All of the characters fit perfectly into this comedic puzzle. I can't wait til season 3 comes out
3,Very funny,"The show is great but i decided to buy Blu-ray, after all its the new thing. The player that i have will only play the first disc. The disc has a program that keeps track of which episode you are on and i think that program is causing problems. I have to watch this on my computer and even then it take around five min to load. Do you have a new blu-ray player? If not, buy the dvd. There is that chance that i got a bad disc two and three but they do work on the PC but they take forever to load. Sometimes they time out."
5,adore,i own both season 1 and 2 and plan to buy the additional seasons. this comedy never gets old and is a joy to have on my kindle fire. long plane rides go by quickly with this as company!
5,Modern Family Season Two,"Modern family season two, is as funny ,and witty as Modern Family season one.I highly reccomend it,and I know if you buy it, you will not be sorry."
4,My review.,"i gotta say i love how modern family delivers in special features, there are tons of extended/deleted scenes, and great features. theres also a live audience table read for an episode that aired very early in season 2, that lasts about 30minutes or so. they put a lot of work into these features so i really enjoy them. and this new ""season session"" where you get to watch all the eps back to back without pause or having to select the next ep and even tells you to put in the next disc is a nice lil marathon feature i enjoyed."
5,And the saga continues......,Couldn't wait to watch to see what Season 2 brought. Now I need to buy the other seasons! What a fun show!
1,Bassoon Player,"This is very soppy and absolutely out-of-tune performance. Any musician is to be ashamed to publish such poorly played record. You may notice slightly better performance on more known Concertos, suggesting that they were practiced more, and very raw performance on less known Concertos. One star is too good rating for the record."
2,I hope to see more..,"The potential in this book is so thick. Masuda has been through so much, seen so many sides of a tumultuous cultural relationship that most of us will never be familiar with. Unfortunately, I think she wrote the book TOO soon after her experiences, too soon after her liberation and life shifts into the political rights movements. Her writing comes across very naive and childish. Should she decide to edit and re-release this book 20 years from now.. I think it's ability to open people's minds would be astounding.I know she is doing great things for the world and I truly hope that, even though I did not think this book's quality of writing was that high, that she writes another book soon. Her content is extreme, it is real and it is something that people need to be exposed to, especially in the Western world. Do not think that because of my low-rating, I thought her book was unimportant. That could not be further from the truth, her book is very important."
1,Just Junk,I bought these and tried to burn the DVD video and they did not work at all. At the begining looked okay but later on the picture just froze up. Tried the second one and same issue. Ridata works for me.
1,pages missing,about 45 pages were missing from the book when i received it. the entire first chapter was gone ....not very helpful
1,do not get this DVD,It only has one good song. The rest is bad quality recorded from a TV with a VCR. Do not get this DVD.
3,Filter,Not what I needed for my project. The description was vague. Planned to using this product for a home made vent and the measurements that were listed were off!
2,"Enthusiast means ""you must like problems""","I love Nvidia graphics cards but hate this Nvidia motherboard.May work with XP, but Vista and this board will test your patients. Once you get it working with Vista, don't upgrade any nForce device drivers. This includes automatic Windows updates. Upgrades have killed my ethernet controller, destroyed my raid, and even prevented my system from booting. Nvidia seems to do plenty of software development for this but not enough testing. They are enthusiastic about providing patched that will screw up your working system.Avoid this board if you can. Maybe they'll get it right some day, just not today."
3,Ummmmm!,"This is a D movie at best, however, the best thing in it was an all girl black rock band called PMS that seriously jammed. Wish I could see more of them in the flick. The Harlem Shake is a recent dance but dancing in this film is strictly from the 70's. Hard to watch, dance sequences were way too long and the people on the cover are NOT in the movie."
5,A great show from overseas!,"This CD is a must have for all Pearl Jam fans! I once went into a local indie record shop and asked an employee for their opinions about the Eurpoean series. A guy there pointed out that this show is one of the best. After buying this CD there and listening to it, I totally agree with that employee. This show really rocks! It's far one of the best show ever recored in Europe. This CD has a few great cover songs and classic originals as well as stuff from 'Bianural'. I was a little disappointed that ""Alive"" was not in the set for this show. It's one of their best song ever. Overall, this one stands out to best show in Europe, in my humble opinion."
5,one like no other,"I bought this cd because of diverse collection of songs in this show. The inclusion of Faithful is what really sold me and I was not dissappointed. Having been unable to catch it live in person myself I was really psyched to finally hear it live. However, the rest of the show was equally inspiring. A searing version of Courdoroy really gets the adrenalin going. Every pj cd is represented but hearing the new songs from Binaural live actually made me appreciate that cd more. My favorites from all the others are there too so you just can't go wrong. Of course ending with Baba O'Riley and yellow ledbetter just cinches the deal. You get quantity with the Verona,italy show (which I also bought) but quality (like no other) with this show!"
5,Rolling Stone Says this is the Best,"While I have not heard any of these c.d.s other than off the internet I can't comment. However Rolling Stone picked this as the best of the crop citing Crazy Mary (the tours only performance), Soldier of Love and crowd signing of Happy Birthday to Ament as highlights.The fans seem to like Lisbon, Milan, Katowice II better but at 11.88 can you really go wrong?"
5,i darn near soiled myself!,"i bought the entire euro tour and began listening to them in order as background music mostly. while each of the proceeding sets were all very good and fun to listen to, this one came as a surprise. nearing the end of the set i was expecting the the standard yellow bedletter finish when i heard baba o' riley. i hadnt looked at the tracklist before listening to it to maintain the surprise of what comes next at concerts. it took me a few seconds to realize that i was hearing baba o riley, but when i did i darn near soiled myself in excitement. i even hollered a bit. anyway this is probably the most unique of the collection next to the one that has release on it. i dont know which that was, but if you are only half cocked pearl jam fan and are thinking of only getting one or two of these official bootlegs. i would endorse this one, lisbon, and any which they play to non-english speaking cities."
5,Endurance Race Must,"I participated in the Texas Water Safari 2011 race traveling by kayak from San Marcos to Sea Drift Texas, a total of 265 miles in 94 hours. I didn't eat anything along the way and used Spiz solely as my nutrition. If you are into extreme endurance sports, this is a MUST for your nutrition considering the vitamins, energy and nutritional value of this product. You will not need or want any other products because this will make you feel full, not crave more food, not make you nauseous and is great at eliminating lactic acid. I'm definitely going to use this product again on my next race."
5,Excellent BMW history,"The writing isn't exactly Shakespeare. There are occassional run-onsentences, but the writing does not get in the way of the story.Along with the story which is presented in as much detail as I can stand,the author challenges BMW party line about widely accepted stories whichare too neat (such as the folklore concerning BMW's near demise in 1959).Also, the author questions certain BMW claims such as the inherentsuperiority of RWD over FWD (especially in light of the fact that BMWtried more than once to develop a FWD car of its own).In the end, I get the sense that I got a more balanced story thanregurgitated BMW doctrine.The book is a lot more intelligent than most books about cars."
3,BMW Table Book,"This book is worth reading because it is not the usual company line that you often get from car-related books that are friendly to their subject. This book attempts to tell a more complicated tale about the automobile maker. The photos are lovely and reveal a surprsingly varied number of old BMW designs. This is not a huge acadameic text though. It's really just a relatively thin coffee table book. But if that's just what you need, go for it. It's annoyingly hard to find similar books about BMW in typical bookstores, as the stores always seem to only have room for books about pure sport models like Porsche, Ferrari, and corvettes etc., so this was a welcome change of pace."
4,BMW,"bought as gift for nephew - he loved it. could have been more complete, some models missing. all in all a good buy."
2,Not that good,"Hello,I bought this 10X macro thinking that since it is a B+W product I would be a good one.It's only a 1 glass element macro, meaning that you get a considerable amount of distortion while using higher levels of zoom in your camera.I truly don't believe that this product deserves the price it has.Basically you are paying for the brand not the quality of the product.Trust me, you won't be happy with the results, I'm a amateur photographer, I've been taking pictures for some time..... You wont be happy using this macro, it was tested on different cameras and lenses."
1,"bought two, both broke","I purchased two of these lamps for my bedroom. The dimmer on one broke after nine months, and the second stopped working altogether after one year. I see that one other reviewer mentioned their dimmer breaking as well - clearly these lamps are not very high quality."
1,The worst video quality on DVD ever!!!,Lucy would be turning in her grave if she could see her show being sold in such a horrible video quality. What a shame! I do not understand what the other reviewer was thinking give this DVD 4 stars. I have a excellent DVD player that makes many shows look like the people are right in the room with you. Even the much older shows look far superior to this DVD. Save your time and money and pass on this.
2,safari hat,The safari hat in canvas that I received was wrinkled and pushed out of shape. I had to iron it for 20 mins with steam to get its shape back.It should have been shipped in a box with some kind of form support to the hat itself.It was in a large box and nothing was inside to push it out of shape so I must conclude that it was packed that way.
4,"Different mystery, enjoyable","This is the first time I have read this author and was impressed. The mystery revolves around a retired Chemist, who works on an as need basis for the police. The plot is good. The mystery keeps you guessing to until the very end. What I found refreshing is the detective is not some hot momma but a little overweight and so is her boyfriend, two people you would enjoy knowing. Over all and enjoyable read."
4,Interesting! Good characters.,The heroine is a different type. I like the use of the periodic table for these books. It is a great format. There aren't enough chemists bringing their view into other areas. There aren't many chemists/novelists. This series gives a fresh perspective and takes up interesting topics. I enjoy this series
3,"A Quick, Interesting Read; Delightful Twists","If you are a Connie Willis fan, this book is not what you'd expect. But, if you admire her versatility and imagination, you won't be disappointed.This is a short, but smart book. There are some strong socially critical themes throughout, which only add to the action and the twists. As usual, Willis's characters are lovable, flaws and all.The book is a bit too short, and a bit too much is left to the imagination, but otherwise this is a quite enjoyable and worthwhile read."
2,"Although the characters are interesting, the book is boring.","Connie Willis has done 100 times better with humor in Bellwether. Thankfully, the book is short because not much ever really happens. There are minor surprises and discoveries along the way but I hoping something exciting would happen and was disappointed."
3,"Solid, if short","Not a bad book for Willis, who I don't think can turn out a truly *dreadful* book. But I think there are a lot of things she could have done with this one, but didn't.Ah, well. It made for a nice little read!"
2,A disappointment,"After reading some of Connie Willis' other books, I must say that this book was very disappointing to me. After finishing this book it didn't even enter my mind once like Doomsday Book and Bellwether did. It was very confusing and it didn't seem like the plot was going anywhere. Like another reviewer said, I didn't know that Fin was female until almost the end of the book. The reason that this isn't just one star is that the book was funny, especially the character Bult so I could enjoy the book a little bit."
4,Volume,some people considering buying these might want to know that if you fill these to the brim they hold about 20ml. I got these for a costume but other people might want then for actual experiments and might need this information.
3,Smaller than advertised,"I purchased these test tubes to hold rolled up invitations to a ""science"" themed birthday party. The description listed them as 1.5"" in diameter, which should have been plenty big. However, the actual tubes are much smaller. The cap is about 0.75"" in diameter, and the tube itself even smaller. Had to return them. They are, however, a ""typical"" test tube size that you might expect if you didn't read the description."
3,Ok,Plastic test tubes my son will use in science fair projects. Nothing spectacular I just couldn't find these at our local store. Arrived on time in bubble wrap so no problems. Thanks.
3,Ok but...,I used these to make lava tubes with the kids at Bring Your Child to Work Day. One was cracked out of the package. The kids loved them but when they went to screw the lid on to take them home we found that the threads weren't that tight and the liquid leaked out in the plastic bag.Note that another reviewer is right... these are not as large as shown in the picture. They are the size of a 'normal' glass test tube.
3,On Screen,"A collection of 19 Haley rarities from the period 1954-1959 taken from movies, TV broadcasts and radio shows including performances from the rare 1954 movie ""Roundup Of Rhythm"", the better known ""Rock Around The Clock"" and ""Don't Knock The Rock"", Ed Sullivan and Ray Bolger T.V. shows, Alan Freed radio show and more. Songs include ""Crazy Man Crazy""/""Shake, Rattle & Roll""/""Huckleberry""/""Rudy's Rock""/""The Saints Rock 'n' Roll""/""Rip It Up""/""Forty Cups Of Coffee""/""Razzle Dazzle,"" etc. Comes with 28 page booklet with detailed notes, rare photos and discography of these recordings."
5,The Best Scanner HP 3300CSE,"Hi,I bought one new HP scanner, to scan my family photos to post on to my personal website. I can say it is really a good product from HP, previously I bought another scanner from Acer but I was not satisfied so I returned with in one week. I connected this Scanner to my computer and installed softwares with in 10 minutes, it took less than 30 sec. to scan one 8 X 10 photo, the quality of that image is really superb. It is just like the original photo. I would recommed this scanner to all. Don't waste money to buy costly scanners, you will love it."
1,"Review for the magazine photo scanners, DON'T BUY!","If you are one of those types of people who like to scan stuff out of a magazine, I wouldn't buy this product at all. When I always tried to scan photos from magazines I'd always get this weird light effect across the whole image. The best I can describe it is, you know how if your cable is bad and you see an annoying black bar that keeps going across the screen. Well this was what happened to my magazine scans. I'd get a transparent yellowish bar (pinkish too) that went across the whole photo and editing didn't even help to get rid of it. Honestly my suggestion is if you scan photos for the web from magazine clippings, don't buy this scanner. The images come out terrible, plus the speed is very slow. This product isn't even worth the lowest rating you can give a product on Amazon."
1,Less Than Zero Stars --- DO NOT BUY,"I purchased this scanner on a Tuesday. I returned it on Wednesday. I could be more specific, but the blood vessel on the side of my head has finally receded to a somewhat normal state. Do yourself a favor, buy something else...anything."
1,BAD NEWS,I HAVE OWNED TWO HEWLETT PACKARD SCANNERS. THE Hp4 SCANJET AND THE SCANJET 3300C. THEY HAVE NEVER WORKED TO MY SATISFACTION. I COULD GET A COUPLE OF SCANS AND THEN THE MESSAGE THAT IT WAS NOT COMMUNICATING WITH THE COMPUTER. I HAVE DOWNLOADED DRIVERS FROM THE HP WEBSITE AND THAT HAS NOT HELPED. I AM IN THE MARKET FOR A SCANNER BUT WOULDN'T GET ANOTHER HP.
2,Bad scanning quality,"I got this scanner for $... after rebate at BestBuy, but I haven't sent in the rebate yet. The scanning quality looks good on the screen ONLY IF the picture is big, but I tried to scan a CD cover and there are lines all across it. That happened the first time I bought it also (probably a higher model). I used Photoshop to import the images. The PhotoDeluxe that comes with the scanner .... It makes the images look REALLY bad. I don't know why there are so many yellow marks all over it.I'm thinking of returning this scanner. I'll give it a week before I make my final decision. I rather spend more on a better quality one.EPSON is REALLY good, but it scans VERY slowly."
1,FAILs TO WORK WITH WINDOWS XP,"Beware of this scanner, HP is either unwilling or unable to get this scanner to work properly with Win XP. Even after downloading the software that is supposed to get it to function on XP it is still a complete failure."
2,Good for Win 9x and infrequent use,"Bought this and the underside of the glass had styrofoam packing stuck to it - since its not user serviceable there is no way to clean underside of the glass. Easy USB setup if you are running Win 9x, but to use with Win 2000/NT you cannot download the new software, but have to call a non-800 # and order it seperately (and be put on hold for ages). All in all I was discouraged and returned it."
1,Stay away from this scanner,"This scanner is a piece of junk. It worked ok for about 2 weeks. After that, I started getting 2117 errors and the scanner software would frequently hang. The HP web sight is replete with problems attributed to this scanner. Mostly, they suggest unplugging the power cord (no on/off switch) after you shut down the computer and starting all over again. That works somethimes but it is a slow process. If you have had to go through it several times, the routine gets pretty tiresome. After owning this for 3 months, I'm about to junk it."
2,Beware - Has Windows Me Issues !!!,"The box says that it is now Windows Me compatable but the driver disk cd that was included was printed in 1999. Hmmm... I downloaded a patch from HP's site that was supposed to take care of the ""me"" problems...it did'nt. The scans that I have managed to get were of decent quality but every fourth or fifth one would for no apparent reason lock up my system requiring a hard boot. We'll blame this one on Windows Me, but never the less, tomorrow I'll be returning this scanner for a later model."
4,Plug it in and start scanning,"This scanner is affordable and extremely easy to use. I had it set up and scanning within minutes of taking it out of the box. Good resolution and good color. Perfect scanner for the non-tech person. Only reason it did not get 5 stars is because of the 90-day warranty. However, for $16.00, I got a 2year extended warranty."
3,"The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly","This scanner worked fine for me at first. No problems installing the unit to my Windows98 machine using USB connection. Then, after about eight months, I downloaded updated drivers and other software from HP's web site. That was the beginning of the ugly part. After installing the new software, I kept getting an error message saying that the program ""cannot find the scanner."" I'm embarrassed to say how many hours I spent trying (unsuccessfully) to get the program to ""find"" the scanner. Finally, I called HP tech support. That was the good part. A very knowledgeable and friendly HP techncian named ""Helen"" stayed on the line with me for a full two hours (no joke!) trying to solve the problem. The bad part was that, alas, she also was unsuccessful. She concluded that the scanner must be defective. I plan to try installing the scanner on another computer. If that doesn't work, I'll buy another scanner from Amazon."
4,It does what I need it to do.,Under windows 98 it was easy to set up. I had a few problems when I upgraded to Windows XP but I downloaded new drivers from the HP web site and the scanner works ok now. I have not used it very much in the 1 year I have owned it but when I did use it I was very satisfied with the output.....For light use it seems to do everything one would need and the 1 touch buttons for printing and scanning are handy.....
2,Poor quality,I scanned same color photograph using ScanJet 3300c and old ScanJet 4c. ScanJet 3300c produced image with poor color and clarity. Its histogram is 20% more narrow. The image looked foggy and dim.
1,"How can an""essential resource"" have no bibilography, references, footnotes?","Worthless is a tough word, but I must concur with the extremely negative review. The section on mortar and concrete deterioration is remarkable in its ignorance and complete disregard of any of the knowledge, studies, and science reflected in extensive and widely published materials such as ASTM and ACI addressing decay of cementitious materials.I use source materials in litigation, and search for publications that are incisive, to the point, and supported by peer-reviewed publications. I blew over a C-note when I bought this turkey on line, because, other than a doorstop or a paperweight with a picture of Falling Waters, THIS WORK OFFERS NOTHING OF USE."
4,great shirt,I actually boughtthese shirts for my horse. Winters are cold here and I want my horse to have the very best. Carhartt cuts their shirts big in the belly and that's good because my horse is fat right now.
3,Runs very large!,"Decent shirt, but this runs veeery large! I typically wear a medium (38 chest/32 waist), but this shirt in MED is actually a Large, and didn't look like even after a washing would it shrink enough to become an actual MED!"
4,Carhartt Men's Long Sleeve Work Shirt,I bought several of these shirts in November for my son's birthday. Heloves the shirts. The quality of the shirts are excellent. One con - theshirts run big. I ordered him large which is what he normally wearsand had to return them for a medium.
3,Long Sleeve Henley,"Based on another customer's review I purchased a small size, where as I normally take a medium. This still fitted me like a large or extra large.I will wear it as an outer light weight jacket with the sleeves rolled up.I wouldn't purchase it again."
5,Solid shirt,"Perfect gift for a guy... Carhartt reliability; warm without being too heavy; soft, so it won't chafe the skin if worn as a bottom layer."
5,"Great fit, great brand and fast shipping",My husband loves the brand so I decided to order this after reading many many reviews. The tips about ordering a size smaller was very helpful and as a result the fit for my husband is perfect. This is a great gray-blue color and the sleeves are also a nice length. Long enough to cover but still loose enough that they can be pushed up to if desired. Fast shipping too!
5,Nice Quality,This is a very nice quality heavyweight and durable looking shirt. It has plenty of length for a tall person too. So many of the t shirts are short these days. XL just means short and wide with many other brands. It was well worth the extra spent. Washed up nicely too.
3,Gift,"The person who received this item was very happy, and so was I. It arrived on time and there was nothing wrong with the product."
5,Carhartt T's and henleys,"I have been wearing these for years and enjoy the longer tails. If you have worked along side someone with a cheap t-shirt on, you can appreciate the Carhartt with the longer body so you ar not having to look at someones harry butt. Thanks Carhartt"
3,Sizing is hit or miss!,"I ordered 2 shirts. Both were the same size. The shirts were different colors, but that was supposed to be the only difference. When they arrived one was too large and the other too small! The product tags printed on the inside of the shirts indicated that they were the same size but were different in design. I then noticed that the shirts were made in different countries. I understand that Carhartt uses many different sources, but they should have consistent sizing regardless of where the shirt was made. If they cannot standardize their sizing I will probably not purchase any more items from them!"
5,Carhartt Henley,Carhartt is one of the best. I have several and am totally satisfied with all of them. Very comfortable for leisure wear
5,A perfect vocal jazz record,"I've been surveying new jazz vocalists and Mickki Brown is the best of many I've listened to recently. She is not ""gimmicky"" in her style or choice of material. This is straight ahead jazz. She sings with confidence, clarity and understated beauty. She has a knack for making even cornball numbers like Misty sound great. She is joined by a fantastic combo - every note sung and played on this release is just right. Hard to imagine anyone - jazz fan or newcomer - not enjoying it."
1,Even the title is misleading,"The ONE coffin in the book is fancier than a plain pine box, but not by much. The coffin is poorly built, poorly finished and poorly described. The photos don't convey much information and the text isn't much help either. The first rule of writting a ""how-to"" book is knowing ""how-to"", very obviously Dale l. Power doesn't. I have seen much better construction in a seventh grade woodshop class."
1,Junky Coffins,"This book should be entitled, ""Build a coffin at Summer Camp"". The quality of the coffin depicted in the illustrations would lead me to believe that the author is not a woodworker and that he is not qualified to write on the subject. The workmanship depicted looks as though a group of school kids put it together. There is nothing in this book that a little imagination and general woodworking knowledge couldn't improve on."
4,"Wonderfully told, but no maps","If you are interested in Mosby's Rangers, this is a great book. This is NOT a biography of John S. Mosby, though. It is a biography of the unit, with special attention towards the leader. The depth with which Wert has researched the individuals in the group provides a clear picture into the inner workings of the Rangers, and the civilians living within Mosby's Confederacy. The book was gripping, especially for someone who grew up and lives on the edge of Mosby's Confederacy.I would warn others, though, that the lack of maps (Only one at the beginning of the book that charts all of Northern Virginia), can lead to confusion about the whereabouts of the Rangers, their adversaries, or allies, as well as the general positions of the people when in conflict. This is a let down to me since Wert included many maps in ""Longstreet"" to help transplant people to the Tennessee and Virginia battlefields, but I had to rely on my own knowledge of the area for Mosby's Rangers."
4,Worth the Time,"An interesting account of one of the most colorful soldiers of the Civil War. The book appears to be very well researched and it is obvious the author has spent time on the ground that Mosby used to conduct his raids. The only small fault is that the author appears to be a bit biased to his subject. While Mosby makes for good stories, his overall impact on the civil war was minimal. Jeffry Wert seemed to try a bit to hard to make Mosby's impact into more than it was. Overall a great read and well written."
2,Disappointed,"This is the first effort by Mr. Wert that I did not enjoy.Perhaps a misconception on my part, but I thought this would offer more of a biography of Mosby.I had A hard time with the book it jumped around so."
2,Expected an even handed treatment,"I expected an even handed treatment of Mosby, but by the time I was half way through the book I was beginning to wonder if Mosby would die on the cross for all mankind. The treatment of him in Mosby's Rangers seemed to be leading in that direction."
3,Ghirardelli Chocolate Gift basket,I bought this for my mom for Christmas. She liked all of it but the dark chocolate. After I got it I realized for less than half the price I probably could have bought these bars and packaged chocolates separately and put them together myself. So this year I will not be buying it. It looks like a lot of chocolate but it isn't so be aware of that. However for those people who want to buy great tasting chocolate for someone and not do all the work its probably a nice present.
1,NOT ENOUGHT,FOR THE PRICE OF THIS GIFT BOX $30.00 THERE WAS MOREPAPER IN THE BOX THEN CANDY. I WILL NEVER PURCHASEANOTHER GIFT BOX LIKE THIS. THIS WAS A TOTAL RIPE OFFFOR THE PRICE
2,It's just ok,THe columns are small to label the assignments. I would not get this produce again. I would have like more room
1,not what i needed,"the boxes are too big and not enough pages for my needs, with a class of 30 students, i need to have multiple pages and columns. unfortunately, there are insufficient columns and rows"
4,Good Information Sensibly Presented,"Gordon Burgett lays it out succinctly and withhealthy realism. This is a great example of a nichemarketed book. He walks the talk.What this book describes, above all, is how toshift your thinking and see the possibilities tomake more money from writing and speaking. A lotof people who want to be self-employed as writersor consultants fail because they don't marketthemselves effectively.This book will either excite you if you are open-mindedabout selling your stuff based on the presenceof a market for what you know, or it will repulseyou with it's mathematics and analysis.At the end of the day the artist-writer would prefernot to know there is no market for his book. NicheMarketing is for the pragmatist - the man or womanwho needs to make money from writing and speakingand is willing to adjust to the demands of themarketplace. This book shows you how."
2,nothing great,I found this book less than inspiring. It just didn't deliver with much useful advice.
2,Don't judge a movie by it's cover,"This movie was okay, so I guess I can give it a 2 1/2 star rating. The people on the cover have nothing to do with the movie. It is a low budget film and you can tell. The plot was okay. The acting so so. The cover makes it look like a fun comedy and it's not. The best I can say is comparing the cover to the movie is like comparing the people in dating adds to the people one would actually meet."
3,cool with me,i thought that this movie was cool. the story was original. something that most people would be afraid to write about. i wish i could get that song by tempest.
3,Rear Liner in 2007 Tacoma Double Cab,"I just received my Husky Rear Liner. I gave three stars because I am a little disappointed in it's coverage. It does cover the majority of the rear floor board however being ""custom"" molded for my vehicle I would think it should wrap around the seat towards the doors. There is about an 4 inch area of floor that tapers to a point in about 7 inches beside each side of the seat towards the outside of the truck. Instead of wrapping around the seat it just cuts over ther. Imagine a square edge that cuts off with the front of the seat. If you have a tacoma you should be able to see the area I am talking about.Overall it is a fairly good product. I like the front floor mats better than the rear, it's just for the cost of this product and boasting of it's custom molding I would have thought it would cover my entire rear floor. This spot gets a lot of traffic when the kids step in and out of the truck."
2,Maybe in England; but not the U.S.,"I had the opportunity to examine this book. As someone in the food industry I was disappointed by Food Chemical Safety. Only one chapter deals specifically with the United States. Food safety is food safety; but when you buy a book on the subject; you want one which is applicable to you. The book is narrowly focussed on the U.K. food industry. Beyond the geographical location; the book lacked depth. Short paragraphs (which made for an impressive Table of Contents) provided no substance. If you are reading about food chemical safety; you want information beyond a short paragraph which assumes you know nothing to begin with. As the book is written, I could see its only use as a text in a library for college or high school students with a paper to write."
2,Her Talent Does NOT Include the Beatles!,"Lauren is a very talented artist, but her treatment of Beatle classics was mistreatment. Although her renditions of Beatle classics are not terrible, but they pale considerably in comparison to the Beatles' stellar treatment of their own work.Still, one can recognize her talent and think the non-Beatle songs were the best in the collection. It's impossible to be unbiased when it comes to the Beatles, who are the best!"
5,Great for studying for the exam,"These cards were very helpful for studying for the exam. They were a great review for me. They also allowed me to see what my weakest areas were. The cards were convenient and very portable. I could easily take the box or just a few cards to work to study when I had time.The cards outlined key points and concepts. I would recommend using these cards as a supplement to other study materials that you are using, but don't rely on these cards alone. You will need to refer to other sources for more in depth knowledge.As a practicing OT, I occasionally refer to these cards to refresh my mind on unfamiliar topics."
3,Meh..,"Sound quality did improve a little bit.. bass went up a little, but the stuff does not stick.. its melting everywhere all over my trunk :/"
4,"Works, but not worth 100 dollars","Its a little challenging to install, mainly just time consuming since you have to remove the trunk panels but not to hard. My sound quality imporved a little and most rattles inside the car stopped plus it doesnt rattle near as bad outside the car however i think it is way overpriced its just a few millimeters of a black ruberry material with thin aluminum on top plus it looks kind of stupid on your top trunk panel since its bright silver and has so many dynamat logos next time i will probably try a cheaper alternative but if money isnt an objects and you want a little bit of a sound quality improvement and a little less rattling from your subs this is for you !!"
4,great insulator,"This sound insulation works great. I have an 06 Nissan Altima 3.5 SL with the 8 speaker Bose system. I installed 2 Kicker Solobaric L7s in the trunk and only to find it sounded horrible because of the massive vibration coming from the entire back end of the car. The subs are so strong that all i heard was vibration from the metal panels. Once i installed the Dynamat the vibration went away. Super easy to install. my license plate still vibrates when i let the subs all the way out but other than that no complaints. Great buy especially on amazon you wont find it cheaper unless you have a ""hookup"""
1,"Sticky, sticky",This iron produces black water and is diffucult to clean. It was so horrible that I had to purchase another one.
2,Toonenstein Review,"Over all the graphics are very good, but I think the game play is too slow. You are not in control of Furrball, you push one button and he moves from screen to screen himself. The house is very confusing to go through as well. I believe even a 5 year old would get bored very quickly. The game also seems to repeat itself often. The idea behind the game was a good one, but I feel it could of been done a lot better."
4,...But Do You Even Need Them?,"I run my Porter Cable Wet-Dry vac (7812) with only the top filter -- No vacuum bag.For shop sawdust and garage dirt, naked is fine. Nothing noticeable in the exhaust. The top filter shakes out with the pull-tab every few days and more thoroughly by hand when emptying the vac. My original top filter is still good after 4 years.If you're vacuuming drywall dust indoors, that's different. Use a bag.But for workshop and garage use...I've saved $300 that I can now spend on tools I don't need. :-)"
4,Porter-Cable Dry Filter Bags,"The Porter-Cable power tool, triggered vacuum is a work of art. An industrial device that is well built (made in Italy), ultra-quiet and works better than any home vac. The filter bags are an exceptional deal here. I bought this unit for my garage, but it has found more use inside the home. They have a fine particle filtering capacity and will fill up rather quickly under heavy useage."
1,hopefully a bad batch,We got these to sand paint off drywall. The bag that came with it plus 2 others purchased all ripped on the top with barely any collection
3,Tricky Lid,"The box itself serves its purpose and it was delivered on time. My only complaint is that I find the lid difficult to close because of the way it's designed; one has to slide half of one side underneath the other. I can do it, but I would prefer a storage box with a lid that's easier to close."
1,way over price for one,no way at this price costco was $6 two weeks ago normal price is $8. home depot has it for about $12
1,Nasty,Poorly made item which is not worth the money. I sent it back and replaced it with a Rubbermaid product.
1,$13.99 each at any Ace Hardware home store dept....,I just came back from pricing these exact bins at my local Ace Hardware Home Store... $13.99 each.
3,Starts weak but gets better,"Vol 4 of Alan Moore's Promethia continues her tour of the world of magic ending with an encounter with God. Returning to Earth she confronts her friend Stacia to determine who will be the one true Promethia.Make no mistake, the first half of the book is visually stunning. Each issue is set in a different sphere of magic and has a dominant color. JH Williams pulls out all the stops with visual references to Van Goth to Egyptian temple art. But after spending all of volume 3 in the magical realms these chapters feel like too much. When Promethia finally returns to the real world and starts the story moving again it is a tremendous relief."
5,One of the best of this series,"I've seen Pearl Jam live 4 times, and never got to hear Indifference live...So getting this was a must for me. The sound quality on this one seems better than some of the others I've bought. Lukin and I Got Id are icing on the cake for this set, which is well balanced covering all their work, and not overly heavy on any one album. This one, Verona 20/6 and Spodek 16/6 are the best of the 7 I've got from this series and if you're going to get just a few of these, then this one definitely should be on the short list!"
1,The worst video quality on a DVD ever!!,"The Lucy Show was a fun show but, watching these is a nightmare. You could record a better version off of you own Tv. Unwatchable!"
3,Good for the basics.,"I used this book to help me write my senior thesis (rooted in music education). This is a good book for the basics of music and psychology, but is not very advanced. A good starting point."
1,napoleon book bombs,"I agree with Mr. Brooks' negative review on ""Reign of Napoleon Bonaparte,"" by Robert Asprey. It would be comparable to reading a biography of Babe Ruth that was written by studying the box scores. The book has hardly anything about Napoleon's persona, which is promised in the preface, and important events are trivialized and hardly mentioned. After reading this and learning almost nothing, I opened a copy of Emil Ludwig's biograpy of Napoleon, written in 1926, which I had picked up years ago. Ludwig's book is much better."
4,never give up,"This is a great show which I enjoy. First, I appreciate the geography lesson because I did not know where Ljubijana is. I learned that it is the largest city in the nation of Slovenia, a small country situated on the Balkan Peninsula and bordered by Italy, Austria, Hungary and Croatia. It has access to the sea through the Bay of Trieste in the northern Adriatic. I am impressed with the recording quality as well as the performance by the band. The second disk is my favourite because Eddy Vetter establishes a connection with the enraptured audience. The final three songs of the set, PORCH, SOON FORGET and INDIFFERENCE, are intimate as to project Eddy into my living room. If you are interested in moving live performances by popular rock bands, or are interested in the music of PEARL JAM, this CD will interest you."
3,The flubs kill it for me,"I got this bootleg as soon as I realized that collecting the 2000 tour was something I wanted to do, and I expected just one thing from it: a good Corduroy opener. Instead, Ed blows it like it's Immortality, and it hurts the momentum of both the crowd and the band up through MFC. The sound quality of the venue is also questionable, as plenty of otherwise good performances are rife with feedback. It doesn't seem that the band really hits its stride until halfway through, with Habit. Admittedly, the rest of the set is terrific, possibly running long because of the flub early on. Alive ends the main set with a flourish, and the encore mixed hits with rarities , the highlights of which are Sleight of Hand (INCREDIBLE) and Indifference (Even better). Casual fans will appreciate the presence of Last Kiss, Betterman, and Daughter.You get a lot of music on this set, and much of it is excellent, but the flaws that appear on every bootleg absolutely plague this set."
1,For Completists Only,"This set seems to be missing something. Apart from the rather flat mix, and the too loud drums, the band just doesn't entirely gel, making for a few interesting variations (Brain of J., Nothing As It Seems, Last Kiss, RVM) but overall completely eclipsed by the better shows of the series (Hamburg, Poland, Milan). Why Eddie occasional flubs the lyrics this far into the tour is anybody's guess, all but completely destroying `Soon Forget,' but it could have been the band were not entirely comfortable in this tiny offshoot of Yugoslavia, as Eddie's closing comment (""Be safe. Have good lives. Goodbye."") seems to indicate they have no intention of returning any time soon. The single stand out is a big one, the rarely performed `Indifference,' and the last song of the set, haunting and ethereal, but not good enough to balance the mediocrity of the rest. This one is for completists only - and even then I doubt it will get much play in view of the competition."
2,"Unstructured, rambling, and at times incoherent","There is a need for a discussion of the psychology of earthquakes. We need to understand how and why we think and misthink about their risk. That's not what this book is. This book is a highly personal account of the thoughts of one man who, if he knows much about the geology of earthquakes, doesn't let it show in the book. It's unstructured, rambling, and at times even incoherent. Rarely can I resell a nonfiction that I've read because of all the underlying and notation that I do, but there's nary a mark in my copy of this one. The only worthwhile parts are mildly entertaining accounts of some crackpot earthquake predictors."
3,Meandering,"Although I found the book well written, ultimately I was frustrated with the author's meandering and indirect writing style. If you have a lot of patience, and are interested in the myths people hold about their ability to predict earthquakes, then this book is for you. I do not have either quality. I just wanted an engaging and straight forward account of current research into the science of earthquake prediction. I did not get it."
2,"Stylish, just not true to size","These shoes are really very stylish. I can't say enough about how great they look! Then I tried them on and I changed my mind about rating them any higher than 2 stars. I purchased a size 6 1/2, but after trying them on, they feel more like a 6 Narrow. They are not true to size and narrow. I sent them back to the seller for a refund. On the bright side, I did purchase another pair (size 7) because the quality was exceptional. I hope the new shipment will turn out better."
1,Don't buy this,"This tonfa is not suitable for training. It is made of really weak plastic , and it will break after your first or second use.It broke after the second day of training in my place.I'm really not satisfied of this product."
4,"Powerful Skills, Conscious message, Beats over the top","Ive been listening to rap for 15 years, and I first heard this guy on Wu tang Killa Bees. For the old schoolers out there, Imagine pete nice of 3rd bass on the backside of derelicts of dialect where he starts going buck wild. Imagine twice the skill, and a level of rhythm that only the rza can produce, and add a deeptly conscious message, and you have remedy, Enough Said."
3,"It's a good, short read","I admire Chuck Norris very much. I think he sets a fine example for young and old alike. Personally, I would have liked to have read more about the personal side of his life and just a little less of his martial arts story. The segment of ""Walker, Texas Ranger"" was way too, too short. Still, I'd like to read more of his material. Now, Chuck, in my opinion, is a real man!"
5,Chuck as always,Great read and worth the time & money.Once you start he reveals himself over and over again.Another great book by Chuck
4,"Great music, not the best recording","I'm a huge fan of Vivaldi, and had never heard any of his bassoon concertos. This CD was a delight, as was the information presented within. I hadn't known that mysteriously, Vivaldi wrote more concertos for the bassoon than any other instrument except for the violin. It's certainly an instrument that doesn't have many recordings to its name.I can't imagine what would possess the negative reviewer to be so bitter - maybe they are some sort of sick perfectionist? My only qualm was that at times (when the bassoon had its solo with a high tempo) it was too easy to hear the clacking of the valves. This may have been due to the fact that I was listening with HiFi headphones. If it wasn't for that, I would have easily given this CD five stars, and it will still be one of my new top favorites in my collection."
3,ok book,I bought this book for a critical thinking class. I downloaded it to my computer and hated reading it on the computer.
3,Honda Goldwing Headlight bulb,A good item for price. I enjoy the blue tint which is more noticeable than a clear bulb. After purchase I realized Walmart sells bulbs even cheaper. Go figure!
1,Made my feet feel worse!,"I realize that everyone has different types of feet and different foot issues, but for me the WalkFit Orthotics made my feet hurt even more. They are too stiff and inflexible to work for me."
1,Disappointing,"After seeing this product advertised on television, I thought these supports sounded wonderful and would, perhaps, help my painful knees. However, they were so uncomfortable that they're just sitting in my closet. The makers advise wearing them 1 hour a day to start and gradually working up to a full day ... No Way! I should've sent them back immediately!"
2,getting into classical music in NJ,"I didn't buy this CD. I only listened to the clips. I really hate this taut, pensive, cerebral stuff with violent peaks. I hate sitting at home listening to this because it it sounds like music for a cat waiting to pounce a mouse. This is the drek that makes getting into classical music a liability. I already have a dozen of these. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me."
5,THE BEST BOOKS IN THE WORLD!,"HI MY NAME IS ANNA AND I JUST LOVED THIS BOOK.AND ALL OF LAUREN BROOK'S OTHER ONES. TRUE ENOUGH IS ABOUT A YOUNG GRIL NAMED AMY.

LAUREN BROOKE HAS HELPED ME BECOME A BETTER WRITER AND GIVIN ME IDEAS FOR WHEN I WORK AT THE FARM. SO I HOPE SHE INSPIRES YOU IN SOME WAY AND TO FIND OUT HOW THE BOOK ENDS YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO READ IT FOR YOURSELF."
4,i luv this series!,"Besides Thoroughbred, this is one of my fav. series to read. this was a great book, u should totally get it. its bascically about, Amy showing Storm, and helping Ashley get her nerve back, and helping a horse, Boxer."
5,a must `extra`- supplement to the Holy Bible !,"Get a bit deeper, understand the Bible better.Excellent translation work, but you need time to read it,it is not a comic book -- indeed great book !"
5,Excellent book for insight into ancient biblical theology,"What a helpful, insightful addition to understanding the Scriptures and theological subjects! R. H. Charles offers an excellent English translation of the Ethiopic Text. His additional notes and analysis contribute added clarity to this work. This book is another fine example of the unique, unusual biblically based books offered by Artisian Publishers."
1,Not very clear,"This version of Enoch is overtaken with footnotes. It's hard to read because it doesn't stick with the book itself, most of the pages are half way or more flooded with footnotes, making it difficult to read. And this version is written in Old English, a ""King James"" version, which also makes comprehension difficult. This version is great for people who have strong vocabularies, and enjoy footnotes. But it's not for me. I wasted my money."
3,"Great feeder, but...","We have several of these feeders and they always attract numerous birds using black oil sunflower seed. While our other feeders (Droll Yankee, etc.) are often emptied by deer, these are not . Of course nothing stops squirrels, chipmunks and raccoons.However after two years the squirrels and raccoons have figured how to pull the feeding ports out of the tube feeder. Regrettably these ports are not well attached to the tube."
3,Great at first ... but didn't last,"Initially, we loved this feeder. It attracted many different types of birds. In fact ... when compared to a large ""Squirrel Buster"" feeder right next to it .... all the birds preferred this one.However, as another reviewer noted, the quality on this feeder is not very good. It has only lasted a few months. The plastic cracked ... the top was impossible to remove ... and many of the green plugs (around each feeder hole) have fallen out."
5,Move Over Bonnie Raitt,"I just saw Lauren in concert and immediately bought the CD. She plays a great slide guitar as well as a tasty lead. Her voice is great and distinctive. The songs on her CD are an impressive collection of songs and you'll see why she's won awards for her guitar playing. Count On Me, No Reply, Mockingbird Blues and All or Nothing demand listening over and over again. But, by no means are they the only great songs...the whole album is a virtual greatest hits. I can't take it out of my CD player! Buy the CD and see her live if you can."
1,"Great expectations, but didn't pan out","I bought this on a friend's recommendation, hoping to find the ""next great"" undiscovered blues artist. As I listened, I kept wanting to like this CD, but it never really grabbed me and pulled me in. Unfortunately, the songs all sound the same...mellow, clean, but no edge, no life, no guts. I was impressed at first to see so many original songs, but the music and especially lyric writing just felt totally uninspired."
1,what a mess,Horrible product - followed instruction and refilled stamp pad - a complete mess - took about 100 stamps until print was legible - DO NOT BUY.
2,"Boring, uninteresting, typical story and characters.","I heard good things about Rave Master from multiple sites, one of them being this one. Eventually it ended up in a book order, and so I ordered it. I was disappointed.You COULD buy this manga, and waste $8.00 on something you won't enjoy unless you enjoy unoriginality, boring storylines, a typical protagonist with a typical objective, and an equally unoriginal villain, or group of villains. Or you could buy something that is actually good, like .hack//Legend of The Twilight or Naruto.(or Fullmetal Alchemist, which is available through fan scanlations online. Best manga in my opinion.)"
1,Poor ink efficiency,"We occasionally use this stamp in our office(maybe a total of 50-100 stamps), and the stamp has already dried up and used all the ink it came with. It just seems like we could have found a more reliable, better self-inking stamp if we had spent a little more."
4,What a great show!,"Yesterday I bought this set along with the one from Milan. Although the Milan one is better due to the energetic crowd, this one is amazing too. The guitar on the whole album, especially on Even Flow, is some of the best I've heard. The set list is practically a greatest-hits album from Pearl Jam, containing Even Flow, Black, Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town, Go, Animal, Wish List, Better Man, Do the Evolution, and some great newer songs (my favorite being Nothing as it Seems). I also like the Daughter/Another Brick in the Wall/W.M.A. medley (listed only as Daughter on the back of the CD). You should definitely buy this!!!"
4,Attitude Lacking,"Musically, this show is one of the best of the European Series. Everyone is firing on all cylinders, the crowd is happy and appreciative, and the atmosphere (a European city square at night)must have been wonderful. And then...politics rears it's ugly head. Playing in Austria for the fans in the face of the somewhat ugly national elections was a noble gesture on the band's part. Unfortunately Eddie Vedder undoes a great deal of good will by voicing his (and presumably the band's) disapproval of the election's outcome in a juvenile manner more befitting a junior high school student rather than a man in his mid 30's. A sour note in an other wise great performance. If you can ignore the rant, however, the playing is worth the money."
1,Caribbean Booty Call - Vol. 2 The Girls of Panama,This is not a porn. It is a biography of these women.
2,Carribbean Booty Call-Vol. 2 The Girls of Panama,"Did not like. Shot in documentary style, with an actual, and quite annoying, narrator. Came off more as a nude travel film than anything else."
3,Low Frills,"While I am a big Sheryl Crow fan, I was disappointed in the absence of extras that make DVD so enjoyable. Though I am not as much of a fan of Sarah McClachlan, the producers of ""Rockin' the Globe"" could take a lesson from the ""Mirrorball"" folks, who absolutely packed that DVD to the gills. If you're simply a fan of Crow's music, this will certainly satisfy. If you're looking for a little more bang for your DVD buck then you're sure to be disappointed."
4,Great energy,"The song content of this dvd is awesome. Every track is a good one. Sheryl Crow has to be one of the best female song writers and performers ever. A multi-talented musician also. In this concert she goes from playing acoustic guitar to bass guitar to harmonica to electric guitar and finally to piano. Amazing! The only complaint I have is about the recording itself. I had to adjust the volume on my reciever every other song. Sometimes the bass was so loud you could barely hear the other instraments, other times you could barely understand the vocals. I expected more from a DTS recording(ex. Eagles: hell freezes over) but overall a must have!"
2,"Great content, Disappointing audio.",I am as much a fan of DTS as I am of Sheryl Crow so I expected awesome sound and performance. I got the performance; as for the sound this disk did NOT deliver. The sound stage was flat as a board and not very well defined. I guess the excellent Eagle's Hell Freezes Over DVD has set the bar!
5,Excellent!,I cannot stop rewatching this dvd. Whether plugged into my reciever or even straight off my laptop I cannot get enough of Sheryl. The songs on here are wonderful and the editing is so nice that you get drawn into the show that the next thing you know it's over. I watch it over and you wish there were more dvds to buy.
4,"Not the ""Event"" You Might Expect, but Worthwhile.","I saw Sheryl Crow in concert at an East Coast venue and there is one word to describe the audience reaction: RAPTURE. This VHS tape captures the sensual performer up close & personal, but like many, many concert recordings, does not really integrate the audience with the artist. Ofcourse this is a different experience a little furthur down the road, and we're not in the heavy metal arena here anyway, but her great rendition of ""My Favorite Mistake"", for example, should have inspired a less mechanical camera/edit process."
3,"Good Clean Video, but kind of boring","This show could have been much cooler if the stage setup was thought out about beforehand. Sheryl rocks as per usual, but the production is kind of lame. The sound is mediocre at best. Some instruments are mixed weird, little staging in the mix as well."
3,"God performance, disappointing audio",I use Tina Turner's Live in Amsterdam as my benchmark for good DTS concert audio on DVD. Sheryl's performance was great but the audio sounded dead. Could be the mixer or the venue causing this but I'm no expert.
2,Soundly disappointed,"Sheryl Crow is a great talent and this DVD makes that abundantly clear. Unfortunately, the quality of the sound mix is substandard. If you listen to it in ordinary stereo, it is almost impossible to understand the lyrics. In multi-channel mode, it's only marginally better. Some reviewers have compared this DVD's sound unfavorably to that of the Eagles' Hell Freezes Over which has great sound. Those folks are correct. However, the difference is not the technology because the Eagles sound fine in two channel stereo."
3,Not as good as it should have been,"As an earlier review said, this production could have used some planning. Putting performers who were wearing mostly black on a stage that has been painted black, with essentially black backgrounds to stage left and stage right, does not make for a very good visual presentation (There are some video screens behind the performers that add color, and the usual lighting effects). There's no back stage footage that would have made the viewer feel closer to the artist, and there's no costume changes that would have added to the visual interest (though that said, Crow is a knockout as usual). Also, I found the camera work to be only average quality, and the director's choices of which view to ""take"" were often unsatisfying. But despite the unfortunate production, this is still a chance to see Sheryl Crow, and until another performance gets released on DVD this will have to suffice."
5,Stunning!,"I like Sheryl Crow, even though I've never bought any of her CDs. But after I heard her perform one of her songs on a TV awards show recently, I decided to purchase this DVD of one of her live performances. It is, in a word, superb! Sheryl Crow and her band sound great in this DVD, and they perform most of her big hits as well as many of the songs from her recent Globe Sessions CD. And if you have a subwoofer, oh boy are you in for a treat! Furthermore, if your amplifier and DVD player support DTS sound, then by ALL means use it! The DTS mix on this DVD blows away the Dolby Digital mix and sounds even better with the sub-woofer. I very highly recommend this DVD to any Sheryl Crow fans; trust me, you will won't be disappointed! It's better than having front row seats, really!"
4,Tweak for better sound in Dolby Stereo,"Bought this DVD Yesterday. I play it in Dolby Stereo, Sound is not that well mixed. That said it is very entertaining and you can solve this sound problem if you juggle the bass and treble dials a bit. If compared to ""The Eagles - Hell Freezes Over"", this is noway near as well balanced, but it really captures the ""Sheryl Crow Live"" experience. There are much better mixed DVD's, but this is far from a bad buy. Buy it, you will not regret it."
4,A Fine Entertainment Value!,"I haven't been lucky enough to see Sheryl Crow in concert yet, so this is a popular title at my house. I love to watch Sheryl rock out and my husband just likes to watch Sheryl! Seriously though, a must have for fans, and probably enjoyable for the casual listener. Crisp picture and sound, but no extra goodies. Bummer."
4,"Technically great, performance very good....","I'm not a huge fan of Crow but have always liked her music and felt she has stood out from the wave of female singers that have flooded the airwaves of late. The DTS sounds great and the camera work and editing are very good - lots of slow pans and wide shots with just enough close ups of Ms. Crow. Along with the great pipes she does a nice job on guitar, bass, and piano. Good band - would have liked the lead guitarist to be a little stronger in the mix though - found myself struggling to hear him especially during solos. This DVD is good but nothing can top the ""Sessions at West 54th, VOL 1"" DVD for a feeling of being ""front and center"" and providing a very intimate relationship with the performers - wish they would put out more."
5,Great Christmas Music,I do not consider myself to be a great Jazz expert. I love music that makes me smile. A Little Christmas Jazz did that for me. A BIG SMILE. With so much commercial cynicism about Christmas this CD made me feel good. Great illustrations of Christmas classics. Another plus... Blondheim's playing is brilliant.
2,simplicity,"Simon, the main character of this book, for being known as a birdbrain, solves his problems with a reasonable approach. Throughout the book, Simon runs into many conflicts and works through to problem solve. The problems that Simon and his companions run into, are simple and don¡t need much thought for the characters or the reader. The time period and setting in this is very interesting because it¡s not modern time but in the 1800¡s. Turkey walks and sales for them actually existed in those days and it was amusing to read about what it would be like to be in that time of the history. Other than reading with interest in the lifestyle back in that time period, and the enjoyment of an entertaining story, nothing pulled me and kept me interested in this book."
2,Promising start but too annoying to finish,"My family listened to this as a book on tape for a long drive (I'm the dad). The book started out with a cute premise and was engaging for about 150 miles. The narration was excellent. But then the book became way too politically correct and historically lame. The language especially dated the book to the 1990s instead of the 1860s when the story was supposed to take place. Aren't we past treating Native Americans as Noble Savages? Would people of this era use the expression, ""the bottom line""? By 200 miles it was too annoying to listen any more. Book editors are supposed to help authors fix problems like these. Someone didn't do their job. I cannot recommend this book. Try ""Old Yeller"" instead."
3,"Book Review of ""The Great Turkey Walk""","In this book by Kathleen Karr, 15-year-old Simon Green is forced to ""graduate"" from 3rd grade to the world. Not having many talents makes that difficult, but Simon finally decides to try to herd one thousand turkeys bought from a neighbor in Missouri all the way to Denver and sell them at an auction.I like this book because Simon, although he seems simple, gets out of even the most difficult situations. Even so, I recommend it for older children regarding a bad word.B.L.S., Age 8"
3,The Great Turkey Walk,"I belive that The Great Turkey Walk was an average book. It was fun to read, but also, a little on the easy side. It was a good book, but didn't offer a challenge to the reader.On the good side, it has a really great storyline with a lot of little twists. Parts of the story where you think the Turkeys are safe, you may want to think twice. It is also fun to watch how the main character grows up. He starts out very slow, but as the story progresses, he starts to mature more and more, being able to make all the choices on his own before the story is done.All in all i think it is a good reading experience and that people will not regret reading it. Not to metion it starts out fast, and ends that way."
5,Zebco fishing with rumblepak,"great game lets you choose the bait and the gamboy rumbles when a fish is hooked. You have the choice of playin blackjack bass or tournment, you can fish in your choice of two lakes, and you get the chance to catch the legendary 21 pound bass."
1,Filter bag - smilter bag,"I have the 10 gallon vacuum. These bags are obviously too big for it. In trying fit the first bag into my vacuum, I either tore the tape binding the end, or it tore on its own. I've had these bags before and they didn't seem as big. It was the first thing I noticed. I've also used the Shop Vac brand and generics but think these bags are designed better if they fit. I don't think I'll order them again though. I'll just buy the ones at the home centers."
5,This is what dope is.,"This stuff is heavy hip-hop beats under some straight-up hardcore riffs that morph into some extremely funky grooves without warning while the DJ cuts and the vocals flow. HFC just gels into this driving force of hardcore funk that doesn't screw around. If there's anything better in Dallas I don't know what it is; in fact, I'm not sure I've seen a local show anywhere in the country with more energy than these boys put into it, and enough of that energy carries over onto the recorded album that you can taste what it's like when HFC lights up a stage. These dudes are just clutch all the way."
4,I'm a get Midevil,"My first live show a few years ago scared me. I was so drawn into it and pumped it actually scared me. The crowd really gets into it. And the more they do the more HFC gives em. Can You Funk is my favorite groove. Live is the best way to see em in full dress- horns and all but, if you cant then buy the album. And if you happen to come across one with the KFC/HFC cover buy it- you'll thank me."
5,this is the greatest CD I've ever heard,"Of all 117 of my CD's, this is my fav. I have heard almost every local band in Dallas, and these guys alone are better than every other band cmbined. These guys have a great mix of metal, hip-hop and funk. This CD all in all rocks."
1,"stings, smells funky, oily","I've used Cetaphil cleansers with no problem before, but this product is a huge disappointment. It stings my skin when applied (and I don't have sensitive skin), it smells of bug spray and by the end of the day it had somehow crept into my eyes, making them burn and water. Not to mention the fact that it made my oily skin even oilier (surprising, given that it does feel pretty light). Would not recommend this to anyone!"
3,Cetaphil disappointment,"I agree with most of the previous reviewers - this product is a disappointment. I bought it, thinking the Cetaphil name AND a sunscreen - just what I need! However, I have noticed very mild stinging on several occasions. The product also clearly states on the back NOT to use around your eyes. Ok, but I thought the eye area was one of the more important areas to make sure that it stayed moisturized - so having to purchase a seperate moisturizer for my eye area is an inconvenience. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this product."
2,Nothing Special...,"I didn't have a harsh reaction to the product or anything, I just hate the smell!It also stays greasy on my face for a long time."
2,Not pleased,I bought this moisturizer because i love the cetaphil cleanser and hoped this would be just as great on my sensitive combo break out prone skin. It wasnt. My skin was slightly irritated and broke out. I thought this may be because it was a new product I had to get used to but the problems continued. Of course everyones skin is different but for me this product was a let down. I eventually quit using it and ended up throwing away the remainder.
1,"Horrible, horrible product.","Being a longtime fan of Cetaphil's Gentle Skin Cleanser--and knowing how highly recommended the Cetaphil brand comes from dermatologists--when the time came to buy a new moisturizer, i was certain this would be a winner. I have perfect skin that I've put through the ringer trying various products, with no adverse effect. This stinging, burning junk broke me out in tiny little bumps all along my jawline from temple to chin, and on my neck after only two days. After immediately returning to my old regimen, one week later the breakout has just begun to go down. I'm furious, and would not recommend this product to my worst enemy. I hate to give it even 1 star, but Amazon doesn't offer me negative stars or enormous THUMBS DOWN icons."
4,excellent product,"Like to use a spf 15, facial moisturizer under my makeup. This Cetaphil moisturizer,does not give my skin a flakey look, when putting makeup over the product."
4,works for me!,"My experience with this product has been very positive. I'm at the end of my first bottle, never had an adverse reaction. It is a VERY light moisturizer, non-oily, yet effective. And the sunscreen is a real plus."
2,Feels sticky,"I am a Cetaphil cleanser fan and also thought this would be perfect.But, alas, it feels sticky on my face when I put it on and in the morning it really feels sticky. Sorry I bought it."
2,"Notes, but no music","I have to give Smith credit - he's done a great job of recording much of the lesser known (or at least lesser-recorded) repertoire of the bassoon.Unfortunately, that's about where my reccomendation ends. Smith seems to take pains to avoid phrasing, accuracy, and tasteful vibrato. His intonation is inconsistent, and his tone quality, while not completely offensive, lacks the polish and sheen found in the great artists of today.Again, the only praise I can give to Smith is his expansion of the recorded bassoon repertoire.Look at Judy LeClair, Bernard Garfield, David McGill, or Kristen Jensen for truly superlative playing."
1,An unfortunate waste of recording technolog,"Smith does all bassoonists a disservice by presenting his playing as worthy of an international audience. If you want excellent recordings of Vivaldi concerti, and there are many stellar recordings by true masters of the instrument, try Sergio Azzolini (he plays on a reproduction period instrument with a ""historically informed performance"" group, L'Aura Soave). Compare the two on youtube and you will never again be tempted by Daniel Smith's preternaturally persistent and misguided self-promotion project."
4,Danger Awaits,"Henry, Kinsey's landlord needs some help and she is willing to help. All she needs to do is help him around some government red tape. Of course it doesn't happen. Kinsey finds that things are not what they seem. She finds herself in all kinds of danger. Enjoy Kinsey's adventure in solving an old crime. By Ruth Thompson author of ""The Blue Grass Dream"""
2,Decidedly Not Heavy Duty,"A constant reminder of why great woodworking clamps are not make of plastic. While it's probably perfect for toymakers and small children, you'll find it slips under tension and eventually the end of the little plastic tube that houses the latch mechanism will shear away. As they break, I repair them with a homemade replacement part fabricated out of hardwall copper, but they still slip."
5,Great improvment,"A great improvement over screw clamps and gives enough presser for gluing, and much cheaper."
5,polaris sno cross 2001,this game is the best snowmobile game ever.its filled with huge bumps and jumps and awesome snowmobiles! you have to see this game for yourself!this game has great scenery and moving objects and water.you can also pull off awesome tricks like a backflip or a hand stand.it also has great tracks and you can find short cuts through water falls and caves.
1,Don't buy these thumpers,"I am really disgusted with these speakers. The reviews I read were all good, but apparently people have different taste in music. How do you turn that damn subwoofer OFF! SHUT UP! I have it all the way down and it is still blasting! THUMP! THUMP! THUMP! If you think that's how music should sound you will love these, but if you are a musician and you like good balanced sound quality, you'd better get something with a little more respect for taste. I'm not going to send them back because it will cost about as much to ship and return them as the speakers themselves cost. Eventually I will throw them in the garbage -- on second thought, maybe I'll give them to my worst enemy."
2,Not the original single / chart versions,"Like I said in the title, these are not the original versions that we all know from the international hitparades. It should have been written on the cover. So it's verrry disapointing! The photo album inside is OK, but I'm gonna sell mine I'm affraid.I have to look further for the original versions!"
3,Not The End Of A Rainbow,"A pity this misses the care South put into his well-crafted albums. Really, he deserves a re-release of some of those, for me, seminal 70s discs. Most poignantly, 'Midnight Rainbows', which I have occasion to pull out of the racks for a spin. This is a marvellous and emotive work, wraked at moments with pain & loss and yet triumphant in the final assessment;crowned with joy & wonder.If it were available it would be 5 stars all the way. I think it's the deep gravity of his voice that takes some attuning to. 'To Have To Hold & Let Go'. & 'God Forgave Me' should absolve any doubts."
4,Awesome journey to Ireland,"This DVD takes you on a journey to the mystical land of Ireland, were you are accompanied by the wonderous music of Enya, the Chieftans and James Galway. This is not a documentary that gives you more insight into the history and culture of Ireland, but an audiovisual journey through the country that lets you experience the emotions and feelings of this country. From the green fields in the southern part of Ireland to the rocky clifs in the northwest and the beautiful streams that can be found throughout this country, you will experience them all, including some beautiful sunsets and sunrises.This DVD release is the same as the video release, no extras provided. The video quality is okay, but could have been better for a DVD release. The audio is plain stereo (but that is what could be expected of this music journey) but good.This DVD is of interest to everyone who is interest in Ireland, has been to Ireland or would like to go to Ireland."
1,Horrible ILLustration of Ireland,I just returned from being in Ireland for a month. I drove over 2000 miles. The year before I drove 1000 miles. This DVD is not a good example or illustration of Ireland the Beautiful. I do not recommend this. There are much better DVD's of Ireland.
3,Uninspired,"I bought this one because of the great reviews. But, I am not happy I did. I do not like this one. Pearl Jam sounds too sleepy. And they do not wake up at all. Please try Milan or Praha and find Pearl Jam at their best."
5,if you are going to choose one of the Euro-Boots this is it,"If you buy any one of the Euro Boots this would be the show to get. Pearl Jam have always been known for their live performances. The second Katowice Poland show(#16), they deliver a sonic punch of energy with their best hits and rare B-Sides like ""Soldier of Love"", ""I Got Id"", and a ""Leaving Here"" in addition to classics ""Alive"", and ""Black"". Best show of European tour. If you haven't seen their tour this year get this album. If you have seen the tour this year get this as an definitive example of what the Pearl Jam sounds like at their best. I can't wait for the US tour to come out as boot legs but this set is enough to get me through till then. Can't wait for the Pittsburgh show to come out."
1,Idiotic stereotypical nonsense from a notorious con man,"Anyone who is dumb enough to think Harley Reagan, a blue-eyed blond, martial arts, gun-toting survivalist world-class pervert, pimp, and friend of porn stars, is an actual Native elder could probably also be sold the Brooklyn Bridge. This is outlandish white racist fantasy of what you wasicus wish we were like. Who in their right mind would not know that this is Eastern Mysticism Lite for Dummies, with pseudo-Indian silly names attached to it?... He's a blond white guy who sometimes pretends to be Cherokee an dsometimes pretends to be Mayan. And all of the time, he's full of BULL like in this piece of trash book...you should ask yourself why in the hell you ever thought this was anything like the truth?"
2,2 of 10 coasters,"If they weren't free, I'd give them 1 star. Media code: MCC 01RG20. 2 of 10 were coasters at 4X with my DVDRW IDE1008."
1,3 of 4 DVDRs got errors.,They have no label on the top (hard tell which side is up).These are the worst DVDRs i have ever seen and used.The Speed is much slower than other brand DVDR such as Ridata.( although they are both 4X). 3 of 4 DVDRs got errors during burning. But Other brand DVDRs are 100% OK.I am going to return these package to Amazon.
4,"Good quality discs, MCC media code","No problem reading and burning on NEC 2500A. The media code is MCC which is highly rated in most media guides online (albeit not the best). I also burn DVDs as slow as I can unless I am in a hurry, less chance for errors that way."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED - buyer be warned,"My boyfriend received this item for Christmas. We were initially very pleased. We threw the packaging away because the shirt fit. However, since the shirt was so stiff, we washed it before he wore it. Washing it brought out a flaw in the fabric (collar) and essentially made it unwearable for anything other than working on the car or in the yard. This company will not take returns (even with receipt) if not in ORIGINAL PACKAGING and if it has been LAUNDERED. I had kept the catalog with plans to order more of these shirts. The catalog will be going out with the trash today!"
1,sizing is way off,"I bought this shirt in a medium size and it was not even close to fitting. Not only was it way too tight around the chest/ stomach, the sleeves were about 6 inches short. I would not recommend buying one unless you bought maybe two or three sizes larger than what you usually wear which is a real crapshoot."
3,A little different,"This is true to Dickies size and fits well. Unfortunately, the material feels much heavier than the Chambray short-sleeve shirt and wrinkles more easily. I've washed it twice, I guess I will just hope it softens up with wear and washing. Too bad, because the shortsleeve chambray shirt feels almost like the old blue security shirts - which I absolutely love."
5,Great shirt,"Best work shirt I have had in years. The long tail is fabulous and does not allow plumbers but, and the material is very warm."
5,My husband love this shirt,This is a well made work shirt. My husband love this shirt. I keep ordering the same one over and over. I think the price is reasonable.
5,best mens work shirt,This is th only brand of blue work shirts my husband will wear. They are comfortable wash up nicely and wear a long time.
4,Softens with professional Wash/Iron at dry cleaners.,I bought one of these last year for my husband to try out because the brand I was buying for him went out of business. This Dickies brand is 60/40 and not 100% cotton. Cotton has gotten expensive due to flooding of cotton fields in Pakistan/India in 2010. I found this shirt held up much better than the all-cotton shirts. A shirt size 3XL is too large for me to iron myself--it drags on the floor--so I send them out. Rec'd initial complaints from husband on stiffness of fabric but it has softened up over time because of the professional washing/ironing at the dry cleaner. I'm ordering more today.
1,Avoid!,"I had a feeling something was up with like 30 ""videos"" on one DVD. Add to this it is a SINGLE LAYER DVD (says it all) at 3.45GB! Anyone who knows anything knows that you cannot get good quality out of this! You don't get good quality!The videos look bootleg and most are not even music videos, but live performances. I was expecting music videos. I was expecting a ""Mr. Scarface is Back"" video but it was a crappy live performance. I was mislead and I got beat. I had to return this crap."
3,Very helpful product,"My assistant was complaining about getting ink on her hands when she changed the date on the stamp I had before this one. She loves this one because that does not happen with this one. I Noticed recently we need to hold it in place a bit to get a good imprint after only a couple months and extremely light use. When we get it right, the imprint is sharp and clear. It might be better if you use it more frequently.Caveat: It came in 2 pieces (as shown) with no instructions on how to put them together. We finally figured out we had to remove the bottom part of the date stamp (blue) and insert the remaining unit into the top of the lighter colored base."
4,Have to replace the whole set,"They changed the whole design, so I have to purchase the whole set to replace the one expired 2012 (lasted for 9 years).Good producttook a little longer than expected to arrive, but it's not super late, so it's alright."
1,Unusual sudden Failure,Charger failed after being shipped to job site. Was in original kit and inside sturdy crate. Is it sensitive to cold soak ie unheated trailers. How to I get repair data
1,Beware! 150mA MIN! Ruins AM radio reception. Not UL listed.,"BEWARE! AVOID! The unit portraid: ""OUTPUT 5.0V 1000mA"" black sticker. Units I received differ in a critical parameter: ""5.0V +-5%, Max 1000mA, MIN: 150mA."" white sticker. This device ruins my AM radio reception throughout my house when simply plugged into the wall outlet, powering nothing. My C. Crane portable AM radio will not work at all plugged in to this very bad device. And what if the device you plug in uses less than 150mA? All bets are off, it could destroy your device in the worst case. It is not Underwriters Labs approved nor FCC compliant as far as I can tell; I do not believe that this device is legal to sell in the USA. I am currently a professional switching power supply designer."
1,Haven't found anything it will charge,"I purchased this a couple months ago and put it in my travel bag as a ""just in case"" charger. I should have tried it out first, but I didn't bother thinking that a charger is a charger - what could go wrong?Well, it turns out that this unit won't charge or power any of my USB devices. My Motorola Droidx won't charge, my son's iPhone won't charge, and it won't power my magicJack phone unit either. I could go on, but you get the point.I've tossed this one and am looking for another. I do NOT recommend this device."
5,"No Pretense, Simple to use and works well","I bought this base to perminantly attach to my router table.. The motorlives a life jumping between Router-Table, Base-Unit, and CNC Tool Head.I was just tired of unscrewing the base from the router table all thetime.. Moving just the motor is faster than changing a bit."
5,this book is awesome!,"I would give it 6 stars if I could. The full-color photographs help you visualize the materials you need for the experiments. This is a great book for bored kids in the summertime, because a lot of the experiments involve bugs and the outdoors, but also, there are things that two kids could do on a rainy day, especially the experiments in the chapter called ""The Human Body."""
2,"55 watt, nice color, low light output",These have a pretty weak light output and are only 55watt not 65watt. Nice color though.
1,Stanley Hand Helpers Cowhide Leather Work Gloves - Large #5418-01,"I ordered two pairs of these work gloves from Amazon. The product shipped is not the product pictured, this is clearly a bait and switch. The back of the gloves is a single stick Zig- Zag pattern stitch and not the double stitch shown. Also the elastic is very weak and does not draw the glove tight against the wrist, as a result dirt and debris get into the glove as you work. The gloves shipped are of a slight orange color and the dye comes out on to your hands. I would not recommend the purchase of these gloves."
3,Not as good as later works (The Letter of the Law & Outlaws),"After reading the above two books and hearing how great Ruffians was, I tried it. I really enjoyed reading it initially; however as the story progressed, the ending was very predictable and the repetitveness of booze and screwing around became boring. Also, this book is very similar to the movie North Dallas Forty (even though I don't know which came first). Read Outlaws and Letter of the Law which in my opinion are better Tim Green stories."
1,No Redemption Here,"I picked this book up at a garage sale and after a rapid skim thought about getting my 25 cents back. Overall it's very distasteful and unsatisfying, like a room temperature fast-food hamburger and fries. Virtually all the characters are degenerates with few redeeming qualities. I found the main character, Clay, quite repugnant and had little sympathy for his plight. His ""friend"" Max was a real moral bottom-feeder, as were the team owner, coach as well as Clay's father. As Snoopy would intone, ""Blech!"""
3,Good but....,"I have worked with computers for many years and I must say this was one of the toughest installations I've ever had to deal with. So if your not very familiar with installing hardware you might want to leave it to the pros to install. Comes with a thin instruction manual which tells you not much more than to go to hp.com (Hewlett Packard's web site). Also, it has a mediocore software suite. You used to an excellent software suite a while back when buying an HP product. Other than the above, this cd- writer has excellent speeds for a price you can't beat."
