2,"Save time and money, don't buy this item!","I thought this was a clever looking machine. It included a travel cup to ease the morning rush and a re-useable container for grounds (which I save for gardening). The price was right, so I decided to throw caution to the wind and buy it despite the less than glowing reviews. Well, it worked great for about two weeks. One day it didn't brew at all. I suspect the switch to start the brew process is the problem. I contacted Black and Decker twice and got no response. They could have won a loyal customer for all my future purchases, but instead I will now steer clear of all Black and Decker items. Today I'm shopping for a new pot."
2,works great...while it lasts,"Got this for my boyfriend last year for Christmas, and it was perfect for him, as he is the only one who drinks coffee in the house. Unfortunately about 6 months ago it just up and stopped working. So it looks like he'll be getting a new coffee make for Christmas...again."
4,Good machine for a cheap price,"I got this for my husband for his birthday! I don't drink coffee so I could never make a pot of coffee since I didn't know how to make it. With this single cup machine, I can now make him his coffee. I just use 2 tablespoons for a cup of coffee. I read reviews if you use more than some of the grounds make it into the cup of coffee. It brews the cup of coffee in a fairly fast time frame. I really like how it has a reusable coffee filter. I never really did like the paper ones. The filter is top rack dishwasher safe so that's always a plus in my book. The only complaint that my husband has is the travel mug. He says when he uses it, he's always getting some on his clothes. So I just brew it in another cup and that works fine. He said it was the best birthday present because it comes with service ;)"
1,Not Satisfied,Coffee maker does not make water hot enough when brewing and leaves an oily film in mug. I tried adding a coffee filter to strainer which helped but still left an oily filmI have experimented different things to no avail.Would not recommend this item.
4,Good for what is for.,"If you want a hotel style single cup coffee maker, this is the one. Nice cup, nice coffee maker. But don't think it is something fancy. It is not. But a good little coffee make for the one person in your house who like a cup of joe before leaving."
3,Black & Decker DCM18S Brew 'n Go Personal Coffeemaker with Travel Mug,"Waited a year to review this coffee maker so I could give an honest accurate opinion. My final verdict is 3 stars. Coffee is made in exactly 3 minutes and 30 seconds. From turning on to last drip. Coffee taste fine and is as strong as you make it. Screen filter means never having to use a filter again and a big plus for me. That's the good news. The bad news is the last month or so, the coffee maker is only using about half the water. It shuts off mid cycle and I'm left with half a cup of coffee. If I hit start again it will sometimes ""re-boot"" and fill the cup the rest of the way and sometimes I have to wait for mechanism to cool down before it will start back up. Final verdict, loved it while it worked."
3,not bad,"coffee maker is easy to use, clean, and not to big. the only con that i have is that my coffee is really hot when it is made. its warm but more closer to cold and thats why i gave it three stars. sorry but i like my coffee hot."
4,Great little coffee maker,"This is a great little coffee maker, takes up little counter space, easy to clean and gets me out the door quick, just what I was looking for."
5,Great little Coffeemaker,I was tired of waisting coffee from my large pot each day and tossing the rest away. This little coffeemaker quickly makes a fresh and better tasting cup each time we want a nice hot cup.Perfect for singles and none of that instant stuff!
2,Get a backup plan if you buy this,"I'm a *picky* coffee person, who went on a budget and found I needed to trim some of the $60 a month I was spending on coffee at Peet's & Ritual & Coffee to the People.I owned this for less than six months when the power switch broke. It made ok coffee while it worked. The cup it comes with is really nice. I use that cup with my AeroPress, which makes outstanding coffee."
4,coffee-for-one coffeemaker,"The machine takes up little counterspace and is convenient for making coffee for one person. The coffee is made quite quickly, so it's good for people in a hurry. I've found that it makes pretty decent coffee, although I've had a few clean-up issues. Perhaps it's because I've been using a finer, espresso grind, but the water seems to shoot the grounds out of the filter basket and into the water tank while brewing. Besides ending up with a few grounds in the bottom of my cup, I also have grounds to clean out of the coffeemaker itself. I'm going to try a coarser grind next time to see if that clears up the problem."
4,Good coffee make at it's price,It's good coffee maker and don't expect too much of it. After all the price is appealing. Plus it works fine. So I'm pretty much satisfied with it.
1,Disapointed,I was very disappointed with this product. The coffee did not taste good also where the water sprays out into the grounds gets a lot of backwash of coffee grounds. I have tried several different proportions of coffee grounds and still the same problems. Also the mug that comes with the unit seems to have a funny taste even after several washings and trials.
4,Good product,The top could fit a little tighter other than that it's excellent. I hate these review boxes cause I never have enough to write and they have a minimum requirement!
1,Stopped working in 2 weeks time!,"This seemed to be the perfect coffee maker for my wife. I gave it to her on Christmas Day 12-25-10 and it stopped working completely less than 3 weeks later. Completely dead in the water...Seemed like a good deal, but dont waste your time with this one."
5,Love this little coffee maker :-),I have owned one of these for several years and I totally love it! Everyone in my home is on different schedules and it's rarely necessaryto make a full pot of coffee. This is the perfect little 'morning mate' for me and I use it every day! It only takes a couple of minutes and it drips directly into the travel mug w/cover & Presto! My daughter now uses it whenever she wants a coffee and I'm not here or I don't want one. This one I am putting away for my daughter as a gift for her new apartment.
4,Good...with a slight problem,"This works. The only problem is that it does not have a drip collector...so after you pull the cup out, a couple of drops can splash on to the surface on which you keep the cup (and if you make another cup soon, it gets on to the bottom of the cup and could stain your clothes). I use it everyday but I am careful about the drip problem."
2,"Filter does not ""filter"" properly","This is a nice product except that it suffers from a serious design flaw. It has a permanent filter (one that doesn't need replacing)that does not filter properly. This results in coffee particles in your coffee. Had I know this earlier, I would not have purchased this product."
2,Not great,"It's not as good as the old one! I had an earlier version of this unit which was great. I used it almost every weekday for nine years, and it worked perfectly until the end. This new one is almost as unreliable as the old one that I had to replace when it became, well, unreliable. The unit is made for 12 ounces, but a) it doesn't pump out all of the water, and b) if you put enough coffee in for a 12 ounce cup the grounds spill out into the reservoir and splash up on the inside of the cover. Summary: the earlier version made a perfect 10 ounce cup of coffee EVERY time until it wore out. This model is iffy - when it works right it makes a good 10 ounce cup of coffee, but it's not good for a bigger cup, and even the 10 ounce cup is unreliable. Interestingly, the unit that I bought in 2001 cost about $20 as did this 2010 unit!"
2,"Convinient, but failed after 4 uses","Very convenient for making a single person mug of coffee. Can even wash everything in the dishwasher. However mine stopped heating after only 4 uses. Supposedly I can get it replaced, but the warranty people did not respond to email. Will have to do this over the .phone"
2,didn't work well for me,We've been using one cup coffee makers for quite awhile now and find them very convenient.Generally like to use our own coffee cups rather that the travel mug supplied. This coffee maker is quite a bit larger than earlier models and didn't fit quite as easily on my counter. You may want to check the dimensions for yourself.It is fast to brew a single cup and simple to operate. I do note the Black and Decker's quality is not what it once was. Our coffee maker stopped working after just a few weeks and we replaced it with another model. Customer service at Black and Decker were not particularly helpful.
5,Quick Coffee to go,"I am very pleased with this coffeemaker. I am the only coffee drinker in my home, so this is perfect for me. It is quick and easy - no mess or fuss to make my morning coffee."
4,Love my little one-cup coffee maker,"I've used several of these different kinds of one-cup coffee makers over the years, and so far the Black & Decker Brew 'n Go Personal Coffee Maker is one of the best I've encountered. It makes a consistent cup of coffee day in and day out, is easy to clean, and comes with its own little handy travel mug. I have no complaints. I would recommend this for anyone who has a cup-a-day habit, or like me, has one cup on the way to work, and then drinks one cup of the nasty free stuff once my first cup is gone. This coffee maker is an excellent value; you will love it."
2,disappointing,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. It worked perfectly for a couple of weeks, until one morning it just would not turn on. She returned it and got a Melitta ""Take 2"", which brews one or two cups into travel mugs. Two mugs are included. I would suggest that anyone looking at this should also look into the Melitta."
1,Smells like WD-40.....,"I washed the parts as recommended, so I don't know what this funky taste/smell is that comes from this coffeemaker. I've tried several times, thinking it was my coffee ground measurement, but it doesn't seem to make a difference, it still has this WD-40 taste, YUK!Other than that, I agree with what the reviewers noted about the after brew spitting, you have to put another cup under the basket for the little tinkle that follows after you remove your cup. I think it would cost more to ship this thing back than it cost to buy it, so I'm just out $15 for this piece of junk. Lesson learned."
3,works,"It works, but nothing great to talk about. The automatic power off and permanent filter features are great. The travel mug is not necessary, not very nice either.Edit on Oct 27, 2008: within 10 months of personal (one person) use, it broke. I had expected it to last a bit longer."
4,Little workhorse coffeemaker,"I bought this coffeemaker 2 years ago for my office, and it's still going strong. It's easy to use, easy to clean, and reliable. It makes coffee hot (unlike some that make it just warm), and has room enough in the basket to make it good and strong (I usually use 2.5T coffee per mug but could double that). I'm drinking a mug of fresh coffee from it right now. Even the mug is good, as I've had too many travel mugs that didn't seal properly at the lid and would end up dribbling down my chin, but this one is nice and snug and stays put. No muss, no fuss.The reasons I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 are that 1) if you fill the mug all the way to the top to fill the water basin, you will have spillage (leave about 1/2"" space from top and you're fine), and 2) if your mug isn't positioned properly, you may find yourself brewing onto your counter or desk as there's no brew-pause or other switch to indicate to the coffeemaker that the mug isn't positioned right."
4,It is what it is.,"I like this thing.It works swell for me.50 or 60 other folks should put there glasses on and turn on the kitchen lights before they attempt to make coffee.The basket and the filter are designed to be idiot proof but alot of idiots aren't paying close attention.They have my sympathy.PROS:inexpensive,small,simple to operate,auto-off is great feature.CONS:Weighs next to nothing so when placed on certain surfaces scoots with the slightest touch.Needs some sticky rubber dot ""feet"" to make it more secure."
3,Inside of mug is plastic,"Just received this. The inside of the mug is black plastic, not stainless steel. Since I'd prefer to avoid drinking from plastic, I'm sending it back."
3,Good Coffee - Bad Design,"This unit makes a decent cup of coffee - good brew time. However, be warned that a standard travel mug does NOT fit in the unit. You basically are forced to use the mug that comes with it or a regular ceramic cup. The supplied travel mug is ok, but not exactly insulated. The outside of the cup was very warm too the touch - which indicates you are losing significant heat. Yes, you can easily transfer the coffee from the supplied mug to another of your choosing, but the heat loss is still pretty big. Not impressed. Returning this one."
5,perfect machine for the one-cup drinker,"I purchased the Brew 'n Go two weeks ago and have used it everyday since. The more I use it the more I love it. I find the machine itself attractive and small - perfect for my countertop. The price point was just right, as I was not about to spend $80 on my coffee maker.It makes one travel mug's worth of brew, which for me is about 2 small cups of coffee. Perfect. My husband doesn't drink coffee, so it's just me. There is no waste and it takes about 3-4 minutes from start of brew to me walking out the door with my mug. Only have to wash out the filter and dump the grinds to clean up. Couldn't be easier.Highly recommended!"
4,My permanent coffee maker,"I have a full-sized coffee maker but never use it b/c of this product. All the conveniences listed in other reviews are correct (i.e. permanent filter, easy to use). The reason it is always on the counter at our house is that I drink coffee, my husband likes hot tea, and our kids like hot chocolate. I use this for everyone's preferences, just running water through and into mugs with teabag or cocoa already in mug. It is quick, handy, small enough not to crowd the counter, and I keep one stored away in case this one ever dies. Excellent product."
5,It's fantastic!,"Ok, so it's not making you a hand-made latte served with a piece of rock candy on the side, but for what it is, it's perfect. The coffee is hot, you can make it as strong or as weak as you want it, it turns off automatically when it's done brewing - BIG plus for absent-minded me, and it's easy to clean. Trust me - I pored through the tome of reviews on this and other sites, trying to make the best decision. I was even considering dropping big bucks for one of those fancy-schmancy ones. Guess what? I just saved myself tons of money, and tons of counter space, by buying this little guy! It's perfect. And it's made in America!"
4,Great without the plastic,"This one cup coffee maker works fine. However, I don't like drinking from the cup included -- the plastic liner in the cup makes the smell and taste affect good coffee. I called Black & Decker and they told me that using my own mug to measure out (less) water and placing it on the holding area instead of the cup provided would not cause a problem. I was concerned about the slight different water amount, but this works very well. Coffee tastes better when not drinking it from plastic."
5,Best coffee maker I ever bought,"This makes a great single (large) cup of coffee. Doesn't take up much space, stylish, and fast. I bought it for my dad for father's day and he said it was the best gift I ever gave him. I liked it so much I then bought one for myself!"
4,Suitable for single cup.,"Few weeks since I started using the coffeemaker.Pros: no waste if you want just a cup of coffee; easy to measure; ideal for quick cup of coffee; affordable (I paid less than $13)Cons: coffee is not hot, I usually put little ice at my starbucks coffee but still the one that I prepare using coffee maker is not warm for me; The water container is not easily accessible.Summary: If you like your coffee HOT, this is not for you. But if you don't mind drinking only warm coffee, well this will be a perfect one for a single cup. It doesn't take space on your kitchen, easy to clean too."
5,My Brew 'n Go Coffeemaker,"Since my husband does not drink coffee, I wanted a coffeemaker that wouldallow me to make just a single cup for myself. Now I can do that and with my insulated mug I can take it with me to the den without worrying about spilling coffee. Just what I was looking for. It is a great value."
4,Great idea,"I love the concept. It's a great product. Truly. My one problem is that water has gotten in between the walls of the cup and I can't successfully drain it. Other than this, it is fast and makes a great cup of coffee. If I set it up the night before and pour filtered water in, all I have to do in the morning is press the button and in minutes, it's ready to go!"
5,Great Product,"I live alone, and enjoy a good cup of coffee fast. This machine does the job. I like not having to buy and mess with paper filters. It makes a good sized cup rather than a little tea cup, and it's easy to set up, use, and clean."
2,Would NOT work after brewing 5 times,"I used this coffee maker at work. I came into the office this morning, got everything ready and it wouldn't turn on. Nothing would happen. I tried plugging it into other outfits to verify, and it wouldn't work regardless.I do love the travel mug that comes with it. When it did work it was great. The reusable filter was really great. I wish it would have lasted longer. Thankfully Amazon was great and is refunding the money."
1,broke after 7 months,"Coffee maker would not turn on; internal switch broke. The unit paid for itself, but it should not have broken so soon."
2,Definitely has drawbacks,"I have two problems with mine. The first is that the lid sticks, so if you want to stir cream and sugar into your coffee, it will splash everywhere when you remove the lid. The second is that it turns itself on at random intervals if I leave it plugged in. To the snide (and anonymous) person from St. Louis: I'm glad yours works, but I'm not sure why you think that proves your mental superiority. It seems to me that it just proves that yours works better than most other people's. If you really believe what you say, email me and we'll trade. I'll pay the shipping."
3,Tastes Like Plastic,"I was initially thrilled to find an inexpensive, single-serve coffee maker that allows me to brew a cup before leaving for the office each morning. I've since discovered that the included mug is actually plastic and the coffee has a very strong plastic taste.The coffee actually tastes fairly decent when brewed into a regular coffee cup or into a stainless steel mug. The downside is that the mug is smaller than than most common travel mugs, so you may need to shop around to find replacement mugs."
1,Disgusting rubber taste,"The travel mug with the unit tastes like tires, even after repeated washings. I love the way the coffee maker works, but can't drink the coffee out of the provided mug. What a waste!"
2,"""Stainless Steel"" mug is PLASTIC on the INSIDE!!","I give this product 2 stars b/c I did want a small, 1 cup coffee-maker and I like that there is a permanent filter.HOWEVER, I specifically ordered this model b/c it advertised a stainless steel mug. I tend to think that means stainless steel on the inside. I always avoid plastic coffee cups/mugs b/c plastic heated to high temps (such as steaming hot coffee) can leach toxic chemicals. It was very disappointing to receive this product NOT as advertised. And why can't they just make a fully stainless steel product?? It would be worth the extra couple dollars it might cost..."
1,Defective!,"Starts brewing as soon as water is poured in, WITHOUT TURNING THE SWITCH ON! And, it won't turn off unless it is unplugged from the outlet. I called Black & Decker and they want to charge me to replace it..."
1,Black & Decker DCM18S Brew 'n Go Personal Coffeemaker with Travel Mug,"Although the coffee tastes good, this is not a satisfactory product & it creates a mess when you use it.Specifically, during the filtration phase the coffee grinds spill over into other compartments of the coffee maker & some even land up in the coffee cup.I prefer to use my old-fashioned 6-cup machine & paper filter with the coffee going into a carafe."
4,Black & Decker DCM Coffeemaker,I like this coffeemake. It is very convenience and its price is very affordable. I recommend this product to any one who needs just personal coffeemaker.
1,"Good design, poor quality","Loved the design of this coffee maker. I used it primarily to heat water for tea. Unfortunately, within a month the first one broke. I returned it for another which also broke within a couple of weeks. I didn't bother to try a third one."
1,Ruins coffee,Ruins how the coffee tastes. It's very flimsy but I guess for $20 what do you expect. Horrible coffee maker overall.
1,AWFUL!,"My husband bought this POS for me, for Christmas. It is early March, haven't used it 10 times and it's broken!! Dead as door nail, broke.Awful piece of equipment - save your money - so not worth it."
1,do not buy,Just received this item and it is the worst thing i ever bought from amazon. i knew it was cheap now i know why. cheap plastic smaller than thought and it leaks. the filter never drains. the only good thing is a got a decent cup. but stay away from this
3,Good little coffee maker. Bad filter,"I bought this coffee maker and was really excited to get it, but found that it lets grounds through very easily. I ended up buying tiny paper filters, but I did not intend on doing so. This problem is why it did not get higher."
2,Not many options in this price range but product needs improvement,"Hi, I ordered this coffee maker for my camper. I am the only one in my family that drinks coffee and I thought brewing one cup at a time would be helpful. Overall, the coffee pot works so I'm giving it two stars. However, you MUST transfer the finished coffee from the ""travel mug"" to a different mug as the include mug allows coffee to dribble down your chin and shirt. Also, the mug has virtually no insulating properties (this was evident immediately when I felt the temperature of the mug itself). Unfortunately, I could not find many options for the sub $30 price range. Oh well, you get what you pay for."
1,Defective Right Out Of The Box,"Black and Decker should never put their name on this item.The best thing about it is the Mug. Right out of the box, defectiveswitch and no light or heat. Now I have to go through the pain ofpacking and returning while I am away from home.I have had several of the older white models for at least ten yearsand they never failed; only replaced because they were stained."
2,"Acceptable, if you don't expect much -",I have had this for about a month and it makes only acceptable coffee. It really doesn't get hot enough to brew decent coffee. I will continue my quest for a good single cup coffee maker.
2,good product gone bad,"I've used these coffee makers for many years, usually getting 18-24 months of daily use before it gave out. But my two recent purchases both suffered from the same problem that, I think, resulted from a design change to the water feed tube. A pressure relief feature in the swivel portion of the water tube spills about half of the boiling water back into the water tank, with only a portion reaching the coffee. The spilled water gets recycled into the cold water, causing the thermostat to trip before all the water is boiled. This greatly increases brewing time because two or three cycles are required to fill the cup. I patched the relief port with tape, and tilted the unit forward to minimize spillage from the relief port. This helped somewhat, telling me that the spill port is the problem. This is a cheap coffee maker that used to be a good value. But not anymore."
1,waited too long to use,"I have used these cup at a time brewers for many years and love the item. Last December I ordered two-one for a gift and one for me to have in case mine quit working, as these are not sold locally in any store. I recently took out my never used one and used it twice, third time it would not cut on---totally dead. Of course, it's over a year old now and I just had to trash it. Such a disappointment. I'm ordering a new one today as I just can't do without it."
5,Grab your Joe and Go!!!,"This was a Christmas gift to my soul mate, who usually only enjoys a morning cup of coffee -- not a day-long java-fest like me!! I Googled this Black & Decker product and it was PERFECT. The product was not available in stores in my area (""it's only in our warehouse""). Amazon to the rescue!! Just a few clicks on Amazon.com and the product was on its way. My friend raves about this little brew machine. He also finds it ""fascinating"". It is a great value as well; and an added value benefit: since it has its own filter it uses regular coffee grounds and you save the added expense of purchasing pods like other single-cup machines. Though I'm not the one using the product, I hear enough about it to know it would be a ""keeper"" for anyone who needs a single-shot of caffeine, and is on the go -- or not! Quite convenient for carrying to the recliner, too!"
1,jipped,I can't do a review for this item because I never received it. My order was out of stock and I was not told about this. Thanks for nothing Amazon!
3,Been to long,This was purchase a long time ago. No longer own it and really do not recall much about it. Do not think I kept it very long. Like the electric perk better.
1,Black&Decker Small coffeepot,"I don't know how I am expected to rate a coffee maker that I have not received yet. I only ordered it on Thanksgiving Day, Thanksgiving always falls on a Thursday and today is Saturday. Now I know some people send things out in a hurry, but two days? We do have to be realistic don't we?"
2,Problematic Coffee Maker,"I initially raved about this coffee maker; however, after a few uses, the steam from inside the brewer was blowing the coffee grinds up inside and creating a mess! If you don't mind having to thoroughly clean the inside of coffee grains, you won't mind this. Trust me... you won't enjoy it! It makes decent cup of coffee...but you can't make more than 6 ounces at a time or it will create a nightmare of a clean up for you. Splurge the few more dollars and get a better one."
4,Pretty Good Gadget,"So I purchased this one cup coffeemaker for work because I didn't want to keep buying coffee and the office coffeemaker has had some issues with people not cleaning it and a forest of mold grew on it. YUK! Anyways, it works great! It's small, quick and brews hot coffee. I gave it four stars because some of the grounds do make it inot the coffee and because it's a tad on the loud side. Other than that, it's perfect for it's use."
2,Good only for 6 months,"I bought this on January 24 , 2011 and this stopped working on August 3, 2011. While it was working it was good and handy. I liked it because using a one-cup coffee maker I have stopped wasting a lot of coffee which was inevitable in 3-4 cup coffeemakers. I dont know why it stopped. It was well taken care of. I must have made almost 240-250 times, so I still think like I saved a lot. I still have the travel mug though, not a bad deal for the price. Might get another one of this kind or another kind."
2,Decent coffee maker for the price,"I bought this coffee maker to replace a older model. It looks much nicer than the old one, but it doesn't work as well. It stops brewing before all of the water is used, so I have to either dump out the old water or set it to brew a second time. I don't think I'd buy this model again."
5,sandy149,I really like this product. It is a way to brew coffee to the strength I prefer. It also gives me the one cup a day that doctors say you should limit yourself to. Easy to use and maintain.
2,What happened to Amazon?!,"The product itself is great, exactly what I need for myself and not waste any coffee. However, I purchased the item from Amazon NEW but the item was open when I got it. There were scratches inside the cup and filter holder. I am very disappointed in Amazon lately (I just don't know how to get the review to them!)."
1,Mug is not stainless,"The mug that came with this Brew 'n Go was advertised as a ""Stainless-steel mug tapered to fit most vehicle cup holders"", but I was surprised to find that the mug is PLASTIC on the inside. I wanted a stainless mug since I tend to sip hot beverages slowly over an hour or so. Stainless is a much better container for hot drinks both for taste and health, since plastic tends to leach chemicals into the beverage. Seems like false advertising to me, and I plan to return it."
2,"Good for hot water, but...","I just wanted to make a quick note here. I purchased a Brew'n'Go about a year ago now, and while mine works fine, my sister had purchased one and had to return it because the switch didn't work properly. When she replaced it with a new one, it had the exact same problem and just recently broke down altogether. One problem I've had with mine is the ever increasing amount of coffee grind residue passing through the filter. I mainly use my Brew'n'Go now for hot water when making tea or hot chocolate. If you just want good hot water that doesn't taste like the microwave, then this is a good purchase. If you want fast and good coffee, search on."
3,Brew and Go...,"I purchased this about seven months ago. It's a good little coffee maker, but I have encountered a few problems that prevent me from giving it 5 stars.First of all - if you lose the included travel mug, it's hard to find a replacement that fits. Most travel mugs are too tall to fit in here. I now brew into a Pyrex measuring cup and pour into my travel mug - which is annoying.Secondly, it takes a lot of cleaning. The grounds tend to get all over the inside instead of staying in the filter.Finally - although I haven't had it for a year yet, it now shuts off before the water reservoir is totally empty. I don't know why it's doing this, but it's annoying.In conclusion - it works enough that I'll keep using it, but when it's time to replace it, I will go with something a little nicer and more reliable."
2,stopped working,"I bought this about 6 months ago and a few months in, the coffee maker essentially stopped working. You are supposed to be able to push the button down once and the brewer should stay on. After about 3 months, my button stopped working. Sometimes there is a small point that the light comes on. I have to hold the button at that exact location for it to brew. Other times, I can't get it to light up anywhere or end up with half a cup of coffee. I assume that there is a short somewhere but I can't get in the coffee maker to check the wiring. I only make coffee once or twice a week so at most I used this about ~25 times before it stopped working correctly. I'm on today to buy a new coffee maker."
4,Great for the Money,"Makes good coffee fast, and keeps it hot as long as the top is on the cup. Could use a slightly finer screen though."
3,The Filter and the Dripping,"The best use this coffee machine offers, is a fast coffee. It does drip for a little while after the light turns off.If you buy this coffee machine, make sure that you buy extra filters, because the filter that comes with this coffee machine is only good if you like pieces of ground coffee in your cup."
5,A little worried based on some reviews....but more than meets expectations,"I was a little worried upon reading some reviews about this product but after purchasing and using this I can honestly say it more than meets expectations. For the price I would be shocked if there is another product out there that can beat this. Some reviewers are complaining about the mug having a plastic coating inside but for this price you probably cant even purchase a good mug by itself. To me it does not make sense to complain about something as if you spent $200 and you are dissapointed. I am sure that B&D can make improvements somehow, but again for under $20 there is no other product that can beat this. I find it very unlikely that someone would be dissapointed if they purchased this."
4,Great for the semi,It is small & compact. Only thing we wish it had a way to snap the cup into place instead of just sitting on the bottom plate.Now we can have fresh coffee anytime while we are driving out west. :)
4,Awesome Coffee,"I decided to purchase this as a gift for someone, and I have recieved nothing but good reviews back! The coffee is hot and ready to go! It is small and compact and the travel mug comes in handy!"
2,User Alert!,"Bought two of these, one for wife and myself, after about 10 uses mine now comes on when it feels like it. For no reason, no water, nothing, it will come on and get hot, shut off then maybe an hour later do it all again. Even though booklet warnings say to unplug when not in use or for cleaning, you would think something with this brand name and an ON switch could be left plugged in. Note I checked the warnings on my toaster and it says the same, to unplug. I guess that covers liabilty. Anyways I just wanted buyers to know in this case you better keep it unplugged when not monitored. No problems with coffee maker other than that."
4,Solved the coffee grounds issue!,"I bought this coffee maker on the quantity of buyers that gave fairly positive reviews and kept the apparatus in spite of the issue of coffee grounds getting all over the place. And that is sure true! But I fooled around with #2 filters and regular small pot filters and came up with a solution as the filter basket really just needs a cover. I tear a #2 filter apart and put one piece over the coffee grounds forming a cap. Voila! The grounds are contained inside the filter basket and the coffee maker a pleasure to use. When I run out of #2's I'll cut up some of the other filters to fit. I also have a 4"" silicone pour spout that fits most cups that makes pouring water into the container much easier. It may seem like a lot of messing around to make it work but it was worth it. I like the fact that it is smaller than most coffee makers and takes up less space on the counter. Now if the space would be taller for a larger mug, it would be perfect."
4,A Note on the Mug...,"I recently purchased this item and overall I really like it-simple, convenient size, auto-turn off, no pot, good price, etc. However a helpful note for those of you considering purchasing it in regard to the mug (for the DCM18S model): the inside of it is NOT stainless steel. Only the outside is. When I bought it, I figured the mug had a stainless steel inside, but its made of plastic, like the old model (DCM18). Also the handle is flimsy. A couple suggestions here for Black and Decker!So I'm going to try to find a stainless steel-lined mug that fits in this coffee maker. I used to have a mug that was stainless steel lined and you don't get that a) plastic taste, or b) residual stale coffee taste that you sometimes get with plastic mugs."
2,Disappointing.,"I was really excited about this coffeemaker. I work in an office with no real kitchen facilities, plus I am the only decaf drinker, so this was perfect. Unfortunately, I have been quite disappointed. Contrary to what other reviewers have written, yes I do have half a brain and yes I do know how to brew coffee. I used the proper amount of water and coffee (even less than the recommended amount) and it still got coffee grounds *everywhere*. It sort of defeats the purpose of being ""convenient"" when you have to take the whole unit to the bathroom and rinse out the water reservoir to get the coffee grounds out. It brews a great cup of coffee, and I like the travel mug a lot, but if you're looking for a single-cup coffeemaker, I'd recommend passing on this one and continuing on your quest. Bummer...."
3,very nice personal coffee maker,"This is great for the ""on the go"" student or business person. Just brew, grab and drink your java on the run. Uses regular ground coffee, not those expensive ""pods"" and has a life time filter, so you save money there as well."
4,Product performs as advertized,"I am quite satisfied with my B&D Brew 'n Go. It works quickly and makes a fairly large cup of coffe. Just what I was looking for, and the price is modest."
3,Good and Weak Points,I bought this because it was one of the few one person coffee makers and it received good reviews. But there are issues that make me want to move on.Messy: No pause n pour. It will drip for a long time after brewing and will drip all over the place when you pick up the mug.Mug Not Insulated: While it may do better than a porcelain mug it still gets very warm on the outside. I pour from the mug into a different insulated cup.Easy to choke: No matter the grind or the coffee quantity it will chokes and grounds will stick to the water disperser. This along with the dripping makes it kind of messy. However I do not use the included mesh filter but use #2 filters for convenience.I can't give it below average because it is cheap and makes reasonably good coffee. I have used it for a number of months but am considering other options for less mess.
4,Nice Little One-Cupper,"Quick and easy setup and cleanup, producing a single mobile cup for the morning (or any time). Age will not allow me even the half-pot of the small makers."
4,Like it a lot.,"I needed a portable coffeemaker, so this is a great addition to my classroom, however, I sometimes have grounds in my coffee."
2,Makes A Mediocre Cup of Coffee,"Like a lot of people reviewing this coffeemaker, I am the only coffee drinker in my house, so the single cup seemed like a great idea. The coffeemaker is compact, attractive, easy to use and affordable. The problem is, I've used it 12 times now, and still haven't figured out how to prevent the coffee grinds from flowing into the cup. I've tried using less water, using less coffee, etc. I think it is probably just a poor design. It is typically just a few grinds, which can be easily fished out with a spoon, so you can still drink the coffee, but it's a hassle. Also, when all is said and done, it is not a very good cup of coffee."
2,MUGG IS BAD!!!,"I gave it only a 2 star, because you cant use the mug because it leaks all over you when you try to drink from it."
1,Good concept! but it broke right away.,"We bought this coffee maker for our trip last week. We were excited about the idea that it is compact, personal and comes with a Travel Mug. How handy! Unfortunately this brand new one broke, after only one use. The ""start"" button just doesn't click when we press it down. Maybe it is just a defect one we got.. What's up with quality control? How sad....."
1,just doesn't work,"I have had one of these at home for two years now and really like it. I have purchased three additional ones to take on 2 - 3 week cruises and they have worked well for the time while I was on the cruises (I left them for crew members). I have now purchased three additional ones for use at work, but all three(Purchased over a period of seven months) turn themselves off when only half of the water has heated, resulting in 1/2 cup of bad coffee. I had thought that I just happened to get a lemon - but three in a row indicates a poor product. The last one I was only able to get to work for a week. Of course I did not save the packaging, so cannot return. This was a really nice product until Black & Decker sold it to a company that seems to have cut corners in production. I just cannot recommend this product as currently produced."
3,older model was better,"I had an older model of the Brew and Go by Black and Decker which seemed better than this newer model in a couple ways. One the coffee ground filter, which is reusable, often gets full faster, by design, and thus I get more coffee grounds in the coffee. The older model was more open and did not do this. Considering, the majority of people are right handed in this world, leads me to the second complaint. The pouring area is smaller on the right, and I often spill more onto the counter than into the maker....Stupid complaint, I know, but again, it wasn't this way on the older model. I WANT MY OLD MODEL BACK!!!!!"
5,Love My Brew n' Go Personal Coffeemaker!,"I am a huge fan of this coffeemaker. It is easy to use and clean, and it makes an amazing cup of coffee. The first cup I made was the BEST cup of coffee I've ever had! I am thrilled with the simplicity and efficiency of this product, and I would recommend this to anyone!"
1,disaster,It broke shortly after i bought it. water doesn't come through. Boils away. I called Black & Decker....they said return it with $7.00 plus shipping..I could have bought a new one for that. I am very unhappy with this produst Thank you for asking
1,Defective and dangerous,"On the 3rd use, mine started smoking, followed by a loud pop and a gush of water spraying out from underneath.Not only is it defective, it's dangerous."
1,Brew'n Mess would be more like it...........,"I followed the directions carefully not to mention I've been making coffee for 40 years. This design is very poor. Directions say put sugar and cream in travel mug before brewing. Okay what they don't tell you is forget about stirring because the cup and contents are so hot it's impossible to get the lid off w/o burning yourself and spilling coffee all over. The first time I made coffee it worked like it should, the second time the coffee ran all over my counter top. Have no idea why, I took the same steps. I do not recommend this item at all and I'm sorry I wasted my money on it."
1,EXTREEMELY POOR PRODUCT,"The Black & Decker DCM18S Brew 'n Go Personal Coffeemaker with Travel Mug is a 'potential' fire harzard & should be removed from the market! This unit, when plugged in and power button OFF, turns on, heating up, attempting to brew coffee (although there is no water in resevoir! This could, in our opinion, start a fire if unattended! When we attempted to make coffee (according to the manufacturer's instructions) the coffee grinds were everywhere! DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM! (Black & Decker stated they were ""UNAWARE"" of any 'PROBLEMS' with this product although we have read many reviews (after our purchase)to counter that statement!"
3,Just Ok,"This coffee maker is just ok. Its easy to use and easy to clean, does the trick for 1 cup of coffee, very basic. Would like the cup to click into place so you know its in the right spot."
2,Not very good.,"I bought this based on the reviews, and am really not happy with it. The coffee smells awful when you're making it, which is a pretty good indication of how it's going to taste. And it tastes pretty bad. I purchased this coffee maker because I thought it was convenient that it comes with a cup and it brews right into it, and the permanent filter is a great idea. Unfortunately the filter lets coffee grounds through (I buy ground coffee, maybe if I made a coarser grind myself it would be different, but why bother). Just to make sure it wasn't a bad batch, or that I wasn't using the right amounts of things, I bought 3 different brands of coffee and tried different amounts from 2 tbsp up to 6. It just comes out rancid every time.I ended up buying the Mr Coffee 4-cup coffee maker for the same price and it's a thousand times better. I'll be returning this one."
5,Great for the solo coffee drinker,There is no hot plate. Simple get-r-done design...put your cup under the drip basket. And inexpensive. So what if it advertises that you are a recluse!
1,Do I like it? NO,"It does not get hot enough. I have thought about sending it back! (that is too much trouble!!) It is messy,coffee leaks out somehhow."
2,Box fell apart,"I bought this as a gift so I do not know if it works. I opened the package up and the box holding the coffee maker fell apart. Its almost as if I was shipped an item that was returned. I really hope the coffee maker works.Following up: I further looked at the box. It had writing all over it, as if the seller sent me item that was returned. I have never had this issue with an Amazon purchase."
5,Quick Cup O Joe,"Been using this brewer for about a month and am satisfied with the purchase. The brewer makes a cup of coffee in just a few minutes. I prefer to brew my coffee one cup at a time and this pot works out well. The brewer takes up little counter space and has a permanent filter that is easy to dump and rinse. I like my coffee hot, so while it is brewing I pre-heat the cup with hot tap water."
4,Works well,"Only use it for guests as I don't drink coffee, but worked well and quickly when I have used it. Only four stars as it was a little pricey, I think."
1,simple set of plastic,"coffee maker is fine, i suppose, for that price. But never really turned it on, returned it since the mug is stainless steel outside and plastic inside. I do not like having hot drinks sit in plastic. I wish in product description they would be more descriptive and not advertise just one little part of it worth mentioning ... the whole thing is plastic in my eyes! It is nice it comes with the reusable filter but that also is plastic :(I wonder what the heating system looks like, LOL"
3,B and D coffee maker.,"This coffee maker I purchased from Amazon works as advertised and makes a very hot cup of coffee in about 3 minutes.The only complaint I have is it uses too much coffee grounds to make a good cup of coffee. On the positive side,I love the travel mug that came with it.It doesnt dribble and keeps coffee hot longer than any mug Ive had previously."
1,Died after only three months,"It's been a long time since I bought an electronic appliance that failed in so short a time. And of course, returning it is more hassle that it's worth. FYI: piece of junk."
2,not for medical students,"This is probably not a good coffee maker for a medical student. One cup of coffee is just not enough, and you will have to continuously go back to clean it out to make another cup. I'd suggest going to walmart and checking out the drip coffee maker that you like and then finding it on Amazon for a cheaper price, and then buying your own mug, if that is the reason you are buying this item."
1,"Great, if you like coffee grinds in your coffee","I bought this coffeemaker about 2 years ago and gave up on it when the pod machines came out. Everytime I made coffee with it, I had more grinds in it than coffee. I suggest the pod machines for those who want a quick cup of coffee..."
1,DO NOT BUY!!,"I never write reviews but feel the need to warn others not to waste their money on this product. I was able to brew about ten cups of coffee before it broke this morning. You might be asking ""What did you expect for $18?"" I expected a coffee maker that made coffee. It wasn't quiet to begin with but I don't have to worry about that anymore since it is in the garbage can. Black & Decker used to be a respected name, what happened? DO NOT BUY! From other reviews I see that it isn't even worth trying to return it."
3,price matches it.,"the shape is not fashion, but the price matches it. New style coffeemaker from the Black and decker is much better than those type."
4,Great persal coffeemaker,This coffeemaker is the best thing since flavored creamer. I love it. I am the only coffee drinker in the house and it's easy to use. I read the other comments and was a little leary about buying it but I thought what the heck...let's try it. It did smell a little when I opened the box. But washed everything and the smell went away. I love the permanent filter. No more bothering with paper filters. I would recommend this to anyone who is the only coffee drinker in the house who may or may not be on the go.
1,Doesn't work!,"I purchased this based on reviews I read and knew the limitations of the product but ... it doesn't even work! First of all, I have to press and HOLD down the button to make it brew the water. Then I discover that if you use medium to finely ground coffee, expect the grounds in your cup. I'm very disappointed with this product."
3,Its good for the price but..,I bought this in September 2012 because it was small and I was the only one in the family who drank a cup a day. Today January 14th 2013 I brewed my cup and I opened the lid to throw out the coffee grounds and smoke was coming out and it smelled like something was burning. I let it cold off and tried to just brew some water and the machine wont turn on. It was a good product if you just need a cup a day and don't want to buy the coffee filters.
2,You get what you pay for....,"It's inexpensive because it's very low quality. The whole thing smells like melting plastic when it brews, and I'm guessing it's because the plastic it's made out of is so soft and flimsy. Makes me wonder how many chemicals are getting into the coffee. It also makes a mess as the grounds tend to overflow from the strainer. Oh well, at least it was cheap."
1,Stopped Working After One Week,"This coffee maker worked fine for one week, but then suddenly stopped working. I ordered a replacement, but it will be two strikes and you're out if that one breaks as well!"
5,Great little coffe maker,"This has worked out perfect for me, not having to make a pot of coffee and half of it being thrown out as I usually only drink one or two cups in the morning. It makes a good cup of coffee."
1,Good... then bad... Invest in a higher quality unit!,"Background: used in a dorm.Bottom-line: I'd recommend a higher quality unit.Pros:InexpensiveConvenient (especially no paper filters)3+ months of good(-enough) coffee.Cons:Plastic + Heat... every mug of coffee was probably a contribution to the cancer fund, if you catch my drift.Cleaning the machine WELL is impossible (it will still work fairly well if not thoroughly cleaned daily).Cleaning it every 3 months, as recommended, while a good idea in theory, can potentially spell disaster for the unit (did for mine at least). I followed the directions to a tee and the next cup I brewed steamed tremendously and at the end of the cycle I was left with more water in the reservoir as in the mug.No point trying to repair the unit since it seems like Applica is not interested in the consumer."
4,Great little coffee maker,I've owned one of these for 17 years and used it at work nearly every day. Last long and good coffee. I purchsed another and there has been no degridation in quality. Good price!
5,Great little coffee tea maker.,"If you want a fast coffee tea maker this is it. Only makes one cup with medium grounds one tea spoon does it for me, then pour into another cup. The cup that is provided holds a lot of coffee you can split it into two small cups."
1,stopped working in 3 months!!,"The product was all I needed and it was great. I was using it very carefully and clean. However, it stopped working all of a sudden! I could use it for only 3 months!"
2,"defective on arrival, disappointed","As subject says, this item arrived ""defective on arrival"" - the on switch doesn't seem to work: not even for the first brew cycle of hot water. After making lots of noise, the water just won't come down. And system automatically shuts off. A big let down."
1,Not what I expected,"After using this single serve coffee maker for a month, I was delighted it how it worked. Now, however, it seems to have changed it's mind on how it wants to work. The coffee grounds spill over into the rest of the unit with every cup that is brewed, resulting in coffee that needs to be 'chewed.' I need to rinse the entire unit under the faucet after each cup brewed. Not at all what I would expect from Black and Decker."
4,Good Value,"This product is a good over-all value and serves the purpose for which it is intended. The brewed liquid has a robust flavor and requires only about 1 1/2 scoops of coffee grounds. The only problem I experience is that it does not hold the entire 15 oz. of water as indicated - and all of the water does not automatically process before the unit shuts off. Thus, it is necessary to depress the ""On"" button 2 or 3 times to empty the water tank. The ***** features - that I like best are the easy use, easy cleaning of basket and the automatic shut-off. The stainless mug is DEFINITELY NOT submersible and serves only as an insulated carafe for a short period of time. I transfer the brewed coffee to my favorite coffee cup for consumption. This item replaced another Black & Decker one-cup coffeemaker that I used for 19 years. I do not expect this unit to last that long as things made in China are not the quality that I expect or would like."
2,Crappy electric switch,"As usual, I procrastinated past the 30 day deadline to return this. It worked great for a few weeks, but then it wouldn't turn on immediately if you pushed the on/off switch (very crappy design). If I kept toggling up and down, eventually it would come on. Sometimes it comes on first try, other times the 3rd or 4th try. I know that eventually it will not come on at all. Otherwise, it would be a great personal 1-cup coffeemaker."
2,Chemical odors,"Made in China. The brewing function works ok, but the entire thing is made of plastic except the cup. The cup is lined inside with plastic but is thin stainless steel on the outside. The first time I used it I ran water only through the system to clean it out. The water came out smelling like plastic chemicals. I poured separate hot water into the cup and the water tasted like plastic chemicals when it became cool enough to drink. I don't know what causes these chemical odors, but I do know that it probably isn't good for me. I'm not sure if China cares what harmful materials they use to make their products, or that these materials are ingested by human beings. I will not be using this."
4,bad start,It had a bad start but since then it's been great! Wish the cup size was a little more versitile though
4,Great for college students,"I'm renting a room in a condo right now as I'm going to school, and this thing is great for it. I had an old Mr. Coffee, but that whole decanter was way too much for me, so I'd often leave it in there and the coffee would go bad, I'd use a lot more coffee than I needed, etc. This unit is pretty good for just making a cup when you need it, and pretty quickly too. As others have mentioned it has an odd aftertaste, but it's not terribly overwhelming and can be disguised pretty well if you're one of those who uses milk or sugar in their coffee.And let's be honest, you can't beat the price - a big deal for all us poor starving college students :)"
2,Has a mind of it's own!,"I received this coffeemaker as a gift. I constantly drink herbal tea and thought it would come in handy with the loose herbs. It works great due to the built in filter. The problem that I have with this product is that if I do not unplug it as soon as it is done, it will reset and try to run another cycle without any water in it. The first time this happened, I noticed a burning smell, like plastic. I think that this product is dangerous and I cannot turn it on and get in the shower in the morning for fear that it will burn my house down."
5,I just brewed my first cup and ....I absolutely love it!!!,"I love this coffeemaker. I am the only coffee drinker in the house and is perfect for one person.I just brewed my first cup and had to share the joy while sipping it.I have been making coffee in the 10cup maker which is not good for me.All the extra cups go to waste.Now it is sitting on my other counter and this 1 cup maker is my new fav...I can't thank enough for this invention.I was planning to buy a 4 cup as my coffee is wasted all the time.I am an occasional drinker and will use this as much as I please.. :). I am saying bye to all the instant coffees in my house.I can enjoy starbucks or dunkin donuts coffee now whenever I want.Like the permanent filter.My cup brew in one min and before I lifted it up I rinsed the filter, so easy.Once again, I love this coffeemaker.I highly recommend it for 1 person coffee needs.Wonderful to have it.I am enjoying it very much."
5,Great Coffee Maker Great Price!!!,"This coffee maker is a great product for a one cup coffee maker. As other people have mentioned it is a little noisy when making the coffee, but it only lasts a few minutes. Besides using the awesome stainless steel mug that comes with it you can use coffee cups as well and just put them where you would put the mug. This coffee maker is perfect for one person. My husband isn't a coffee drinker so it works great for me!!! Enjoy!!!"
2,it burned up,Darn thing caught fire and burned up. Turned out to be a faulty ON switch. like the idea but not at the expense of your house or?
1,Quality,"I am very disappointed with this item. I followed all directions carefully and when I pulled the showerhead down to clean it, the prongs that hold it snapped off. They were just two tiny plastic balls. For a Black & Decker product, this does not even come close to the quality of their name."
2,Dribble Cup,"Congratulations to Black and Decker. They have managed to design the perfect dribble cup.The coffee maker itself works fine and makes a nice one cup serving which certainly reduces the amount of coffee that I normally would end up throwing away. However, one cannot drink from the cup/lid without coffee dribbling down one's chin and/or ending up on the front of one's shirt. This is particularly frustrating, if not downright dangerous, when one is driving. Cannot recommend this product."
4,great for college student,much less expensive than a keurig; no exposed heating element so complies w/dorm regs and you can use any coffee or heat water for tea
2,"Ok, but mug wasn't to travelable","Coffee maker was nice and small, but mug does not close all the way and can spill easily."
2,Broke after five months of occasional use,"I would give this only one star, but it did last for a few months.It worked quite well for about five months of light use (a few times per week), then the top section broke."
4,A perfect one cup coffee maker,"This makes hot coffee fast. I use it at work. The cord is extremely short, so I have an extension cord on my desk for it. I used #1 paper coffee filters instead of the reusable filter because the reusable filters usually allow coffee dust through. The only thing I would like to see is a taller coffee mug. I use a larger mug so there's enough room for milk, so I pour the coffee from the shorter mug into my larger travel mug. If you drink your coffee black, you might not have this problem. The mug gets very hot, which probably means all the heat is escaping from the coffee. I don't know how long the coffee stays hot because I don't drink it from the original mug. If the coffee brewer was taller so I could use my own travel mug, I'd give it five stars."
1,"Great idea, bad execution","I am very disappointed with this product. It is a great concept -- brewing a single serving into a thermal mug. However, it doesn't work well, at least not for me. The hot water is expressed very forcefully into the filter basket where the coffee grounds are. So much so that it scatters the grounds throughout the entire inside of the product -- into the water reservoir and into the brewed coffee. Cleaning this mess up is a real drag. You end up with a cup of hot coffee that is filled with coffee grounds."
1,Not worth it,"I wanted this coffee maker for a long time before I finally bought it. What a disappointment! I have had coffee grounds in my coffee almost every time. I have tried different brands of coffee, different levels of water, everything. I am going to try and get my money back on this one.There is a Cuisinart model similar to this that is more expensive, but I think it's worth checking out before you bother with this one."
5,Single Brewing Coffeemaker,"Does a great job for the price,easy to use I would highly recommend it. Use it for coffee and also for cup-o-soup."
4,a quick coffee,great to grab and go Not sure I like the taste as well as a cup but convenience is important
3,Nyeh,"The coffee is inconsistent- sometimes great, other times just so so. The coffee grinds get EVERYWHERE and make a HUGE mess to clean up very time I use it."
5,Loved it!,I sent it to my girlfriend for her birthday and she loved it right away. She needed it because she travels often and it made a perfect gift. She and I both agree that the coffee makers and the coffee in hotel is horrid.
5,Delivers - fast & and great coffee,"My husband & I have used this coffee maker for over 12 years with no problems. This is designed for the 1 cup household, however we have used it to make 2 cups in a row with NO issues for many years. If you need to make several cups in a row it does get VERY hot & sometimes the grounds overflow - easy remedy ... rinse the machine out with cold water & let it set for just a few minutes to cool off. I love being able to get my strong cup of coffee while my husband likes his a bit milder ... this is a GREAT solution!"
4,great 1 cup brewer !,"this one cup coffee maker is great!! it's very easy to use and I love the automatic shut off. the coffee brews extremely hot into the travel mug that is included, or any other mug that fits. the only complaint I have is with the lid for the travel mug itself. it doesn't screw on tightly, and it's rather hard to drink out of without dripping or spilling. I actually brew the coffee into the mug, and then transfer it into a tight lidded travel mug I already have."
4,Still going strong after 4 years,"I received this as a gift a little over 4 years ago, and this gets used daily. Still holding up strong. I've had three problems though:-the provided mug's (mostly rubber) handle broke off about 2 years in (although a normal coffee mug works fine in its place)-over the years this gets harder and harder to clean-there is almost always water left in the reservoir which has to be manually emptied afterwards (this results in slightly less coffee in your mug, and i have to compensate with more water to begin with)Despite these issues, this is a cheap solution for a solo coffee drinker in a house. If you don't want to mess with expensive pods, this is perfect. If mine died tomorrow I'd buy another one immediately."
1,don't purchase,This is the second Black and Decker Brew n Go I have bought. Both quit within the first month. Poorly crafted. Avoid.
5,Black &Decker Coffeemaker DCM18S,"The unit is great for one cup of drip coffee at a time. The permanant filter basket works just fine. If you must have it filtered through paper you can cut up large filters to fit the basket or use individual coffee bags, because small filters are difficult to find. The insulated stainless steel spill resistent mug is a great accessory for those that drive and drink coffee. It keeps the coffee hot a long time. For those of you that live alone or are the only coffee drinker in the house or office, it is a great little gadget. I think the drip coffee tastes better then the bag in cup like you make tea type brewing. This my second Black and Decker one cup. The first one didn't come with the cup. I purchased this one and put the old away for a back up in case this one fails"
1,"Good well it works, but won't work long","Got this coffee maker and it worked well for awhile. It brewed a decent cup of coffee quickly and didn't need disposable filters which I liked. However, it stopped working. Called customer service and after a long wait and another $7.50 for shipping and handling got a replacement. This coffee maker worked well for a while. Then it only started brewing half a coffee, leaving water in the reservoir. When I dumped out the water in the reservoir a plastic piece fell out. Now the coffee maker doesn't work well and its not worth paying more shipping in handling to get the same poorly make item. I'll spend more money for better quality next time."
5,The Best Coffee Maker Ever!!!,"This thing rocks! I bought it after having a newborn, my third boy. I now have three kids under 4 and boy do I need my morning coffee. It's so great being able to make a cup of joe as quickly as I can with this coffee maker. I'm not a hot coffee drinker so I make Iced coffee with it. I brew a cup normally then poor it into a cup of ice, let that cool a minute then poor it back into the cup with some more ice and coffee mate creamer, tastes delish! I've even been using it to make Iced Tea. I have to rinse the filter pretty well first otherwise the tea ends up tasting a bit like coffee. I'm looking on amazon to buy another permanent filter, one for coffee and the other for tea. I absolutely love this coffee maker, best one I've ever owned. It's quick, easy, cheap and doesn't take up much space. GET IT!"
3,It does the job,"I've owned several of these. Not because I think theyre the best but simply because it can hold a wide variety of sized mugs. The one major flaw, and B&D; hasnt addressed it after all these years, is that condensation forms on the chamber lid during brewing. It then runs out to the outer lip at which point it runs down the sides of the machine and gets all over the counter. You'd be amazed at how much water is lost.Also, forget the reusable basket. Just get some #2 cone filters. Its less mess and the coffee tastes better.If you get a good machine these will last years. Just keep the plastic clean since it will absorb the old oils and leave you with a lousy cup of joe."
4,Coffee for One,I bought this to take with me when I go to my Beach apt or to my Mother's (she doesn't drink coffee) so I am th eonly one craving for a cup of Joe! It is small enough to pack and the cofee is very good.
4,Great for work,"I keep this at my desk because I don't like the coffee offerings in the office. My only complaint is that it gets a little noisy towards the end of the brewing cycle. Other than that, it's great!"
5,Perfect!!!!!!!!!,"This is absolutely great for me. I don't have a big kitchen to fit a huge coffee maker. I'm always in a rush in the mornings. All I need is one cup of coffee and I'm out the door. It's great that it comes with it's own coffee mug that it brews right into. I'm very, very pleased."
3,Brews Fast and Nice Mug,"Brew 'n Go makes a quick, decent cup of coffee if you need something fast in the morning. The coffee is hot and the mug is of great quality. My main complaint is the silt at the bottom of each cup. I use regular auto drip coffee and it still leaves a fine layer of silt at the bottom of each cup."
5,12.5 years later.,"This little coffee maker had been a faithful friend for 12.5 years. Yesterday, it brewed it's last cup of coffee. I'm sad to see my original go bit so thankful they are still made. Order it, you won't be sorry. Good HOT cup of coffee."
5,Great buy!,Bought this coffee maker for my husband for Christmas and it's paid for itself five times over! It's done brewing in the time it takes for him to put his shoes and coat on in the morning. No more wasting time and money at the local convenience store! Great buy!
5,Great little coffee maker,"Works like a charm, and you can use standard (#4) paper filters too--just tear off the extra 1/3 that will stick out."
2,apparently lacks QC,"I want to use my own local coffee and strength, so a coffee maker that does NOT use pods is a must. This unit was top rated for a small coffee maker that didn't use pods. But mine always left half the water in the reservoir after brewing. It took 3 rounds to get all the water to brew. And my favorite coffee always tasted bitter. Disappointed after all the review reading, mine was such a dud.So, I spent more time searching and ordered the 4-cup Mr. Coffee. I like it soooo much better. Coffee tastes much better, All the water is siphoned out in one brew. Pause and serve is very nice plus. Very easy to rinse glass pot and pour into reservoir. My only complaint is I wish it has a auto off after an hour or so. I have to remember to turn off heat plate -- and that's risky."
2,Mug with BPA chemical,"Everything is o.k. except one thing, which happens to be important enough for me not to use this product. The internal wall of the mug is made with plastic, which is not BPA-free. Especially with hot liquid, it is not advisable to drink from this mug."
4,Perfect for a dorm or single person,"I like the mug and the coffee pot. They both are attractive and feel solid enough. The pot does sometimes drip water out of the top during the brew, but it's not excessive. It's a cheaper coffee pot, so there's always a little give or take. It brews coffee fast enough, and I use it to heat water for tea as well. I also like that it has a permanent filter, that saves money and headaches when you forget to buy new paper filters for other pots. If you want something that's affordable and does the trick, buy this."
5,Office Coffee Pot,For the price this Coffee maker is fast! I takes about 3 minutes to make me a great cup of coffee while at the office. Great buy!
5,Amazing gift,This was a amazing gift I gave to a frnd.Its really quick and makes very good coffee.(though I am not a regular coffee drinker). The best part I liked is for a student its perfect 'cos u don't have to clean ne stuff. just make ur coffee and drink and then again make it. Don't waste your time in complicated coffee maker. makes instant coffee TO GO..!!!Cheers..!!
5,Black & Decker Brew 'n Go - excellent one-cup coffee brewer,"We have used one of these for years. We have another we take on trips. And, we have given several as gifts. It's the simplest and best one-cup coffee brewer we have found. And it is inexpensive. Our original one has never failed, but we do have a water filtering system which may be partly accountable for its longevity (?). In any case, we try to keep an extra around in case one goes bad. You cannot readily find them in stores. Glad to have found these on Amazon."
4,Excellent Quick Coffee Maker,This is our second Black & Decker Brew 'n Go and we really like it. We had the first one for several years before we had to replace it due to the switch going out. We couldn't wait to get a new one and no other small coffee maker would do! It's very convenient and especially good for a quick cup on the go or if you have caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee drinkers in the house. The filter system is great since you don't have to buy filters. The only reason we wouldn't give it a 5 star rating is the travel mug can take on water between the inner and outer pieces.
4,easy for a single person,"I've set it on my nightstand so I can set it up the evening before and wake up to a cup of hot joe in the morning. Admittedly, I'm not the most discerning coffee maker, but my first cup tasted watery. I noticed the supplied filter lets water through it very rapidly. I read reviews where people put an additional #1 filter in there to reduce clean up and enhance flavor. I went to Wal-Mart and could only find the number 4 and I cut it down to size. I only brew about 7 ounces and it didn't spill over and it tasted stronger with the filter. I did notice that you have to be careful when placing the filter into the unit, because if you get it wrong, the holes won't line up, possibly causing the overflow. That would not be a fun way to wake up!So, if it holds up a couple of years, I think it's great buy. I'll definitely re-rate it if it breaks."
5,Great Little coffee maker,"I love this coffee maker it is great for one person that is in a hurry to go, makes a good cup of coffee, once you get the right amount of coffee figured out. Its easy to clean & you can also use it to heat up water for cocoa or tea faster and hotter than a microwave. The stainless steel mug is great keeps your beverage hot for quite some time. It's just what I was looking for. I have found no problems with it yet. Used it about 10-15 times so far, been excellent !! I love it. I would reccommend this to anyone in a hurry & on the go, Or someone who is alone and only needs 1 cup of coffee. tlynnfav NY"
4,Very good for the price,This is my fifth or sixth brew n go. It makes a good cup of coffee and I have had them last from a few months to two years. For the price it's hard to beat. I make about three to four cups a day of coffee or tea and if it lasts only a year it's only a few cents per cup.
4,Be very careful not to overfill with grounds,"Perfect for the office environment, but be very cautious about using too many grounds. Thankfully the coffee pot has a built in overflow prevention system, but washing the grounds out of the unit is not an easy task. Brushed steel mug that comes with it is nice, overall its worth the $17."
2,coffee maker,"I have been a bit dissapointed with this coffee maker. I always end up with coffee grounds all over when I brew a cup. Don,t know why, using too much coffee grounds?"
2,Mug leaves a lot to be desired,"The mug is lined with plastic, is too small, and is a strange shape that doesn't fit my car cup holders. You can't use your own larger mug with it."
3,Second time a charm.,"The first coffee maker I received turned off before all the water went through and left me with a 1/2 to 2/3 cup of coffee. I contacted the manufacturer and they wanted me to cut the cord off and mail it to them. I then contacted Amazon who immediately sent me a return label. I put the coffee maker back in the original packaging and sent if off. By the time Amazon received my returned coffee maker, I had received the replacement. It works great for a low price coffee maker. My husband doesn't drink coffee and I drink 1 - 2 cups per day. This suits me just fine and I don't have to buy filters for a single cup."
3,Broke after 1 month!!!,"Despite other reviews claiming that their B&D personal coffeemaker broke pretty quickly after buying, I ordered one anyway. It worked perfectly for about a month. One day it decided not to work anymore...we didn't move it or do anything. it just stopped working. I registered my unit, then emailed their customer service and their email responses were pretty ridiculous (i.e. did you plug it in?) So I called their customer service and got a no-nonsense CSR that reviewed the notes on my file, agreed it's under warranty and agreed to replace it so long as I send them 1) the plug & some of the cord from the unit and 2) a $10 check for S&H on the replacement item. S&H was almost half cost of the unit! In the end, she agreed to waive the S&H. I can't give them an A for friendly service, but they got the job done. I'll be sending in my plug tomorrow...we'll see if they send me a replacement unit!"
2,Ok brewer,"I bought this since a lot of reviewers liked the unit. It is ok. Nothing special. It takes about 4 min for all the liquid to pour through. It is nice and hot. The only real problem is that the grounds tend to overflow a bit, making cleaning a little more than just emptying out the permanent filter That part has annoyed me at times. The other real problem is that the lid on the cup leaks. It does not make a seal so I end up transferring the coffee to another mug."
3,B&D DCM18S coffee maker,"I like the personal coffe maker because of being fast and you can make just one cup at a time. The things i have found is that when you use fine ground coffee like Duncan Donut coffee, some of the grounds get into the cup. I found that if you use regular grind coffee like Folgers Classic, that does not happen. After washing in the dishwasher, the cup lid is loose and may come off. I think that maybe if you use #1 coffee filter, it may help keep the grounds out of the cup but they are impossible to fing where i live. According to the price of full size coffee makers, the DCM18S, is a little over priced."
5,Good replacement for my old Black & Decker one cup coffeemaker,"My old Black & Decker one-cup coffee maker died after many years of service. I found this Black & Decker Brew n Go coffeemaker with Travel Mug and it is as good or better than the one it replaced. The space for the cup or mug is taller, so I can use any mug in my cupboard. The permanent filter works great and cleans easily. The only downside is that the inside of the water reservoir is black and it is difficult to see the water level (not a big deal if you are filling it with the cup you will be using).This coffee maker is a whole lot cheaper to buy and use than the new cup-at-a-time machines that require you to purchase the individual coffee containers to load. In my opinion, it is more environmentally responsible as well."
2,"Good coffee maker, poorly designed travel mug","The coffee maker is great. It's quick and easy and makes a fine cup of coffee. The only problem with this product is the travel mug that it comes with. Most of the travel mugs I own have a plug of some type that I can cover the drinking hole with. This mug does not. And so when I'm driving to work, coffee spills out. Or I brew coffee into this mug and pour it into a better one to take to work with me. An unnecessary step if the mug was designed right."
5,Perfect,"It's exactly what I was looking for. It makes the perfect, one cup of coffee for me, the only coffee drinker in my house. It's simple, quick, easy to clean, and makes great-tasting coffee. I can now enjoy something better than instant from home."
2,Too little too soon,"While the concept is a great idea, the implementation stopped a little short. I like dark roast coffee. I use more than 2 tbs. for my brew. The foam covers the hot water spreader and leaves a residue of coffee oils and grounds that is hard to clean off. I am also in a wheel chair. Maybe standing makes pouring the water in easier, I usually make a mess. I also wish the cup was more insulated. The coffee gets cold too soon. It may sound as if I do not like my coffee maker, not so. I just wish for some improvements.Black & Decker DCM18S Brew 'n Go Personal Coffeemaker with Travel Mug"
4,Keeps on ticking,I bought this in 2003 and still use it everyday. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the permanent filter does let a little coffee ground through so I usually put a small paper filter in the basket to resolve this issue. It has been a great little coffee maker
4,I've grown to almost love this product!,"I admit, I _almost_ returned this after two months of use due to water staying in the well as mentioned by other reviewersa and which happens even if you decalcify with vinegar on a monthly basis as per the instructions. However, it never went beyond an inch remaining in the well and I simply adjusted the amount of coffee until I had just the right coffee for me. Normally I'd give a product just two stars for failing to work in accordance with it's own instructions but given I've had it for well over a year now and it still works and makes a great cup of coffee, I have to concede that in this case, I got a fair trade for my $18."
2,Not impressed,"Bought this with the idea of brew and go ... Well lid is not made for travel , leaked everywhere on my white work blouse. We would have sent it right back however tossed the box too soon. Also cup cannot be put in dishwasher as there is now water between the 2 metal layers in cup. I don't recommend this product! I got it as an in the meantime while waiting to get a Keurig - guess you get what ya pay for !"
1,Garbage,"I'd give it zero if I could. The first one broke in 2 weeks, the second one 5 months. It your grounds aren't right, it will back up and leak and can be messy as well. There has to be something FAR better for s single person"
2,"Makes Coffee, BUT... BUT... The Mug Is Useless!","I realize I purchased a cheap item. BUT... I didn't buy it for the coffee maker aspect, but rather the unique mug that's included. I've already 2 of these and only bought this one because I wanted another identical mug. The coffee maker is still in its original box... I don't need it. However, the mug being my reason for buying this since I can't find another like it to fit under my k-cup brewer... IT SUCKS! The lid is loose fitting making it a dripping nightmare on my way to the office in the morning. It's too late I think for me to return this so my option is to consider my money flushed down the proverbial toilet and throw the whole mess in the dumpster. If you want a useable, dripless mug... DON'T BUY THIS ITEM!"
4,Hate the shipping time but love the product!,"I really liked the product but HATED AMAZON SHIPPING, the reason for four stars. It took 7 days to travel 100 miles after Amazon said it was shipped. Another product, toner, took 3 days to travel the same 100 miles even after 2-day shipping was paid. This is only my second purchase with Amazon but when they email you the delivery date shouldn't it arrive on time? Amazon needs to crack the whip on their shipping department. I'm sure they have lost more sales then just me because of it. As to the coffee maker, I am going to buy spares because it brews the coffee any way I want it. B&D is not a good make because of moving to China but they got lucky with this item"
1,coffeemaker,I hate it because it get very dirty inside the machine which it give me a terrible taste. I got a new coffeemaker fromAmazon and I loved it.
3,"nice looking, brews pretty good coffee but has one big flaw",sometimes the coffee doesn't flow into the cup but drips toward the back rim and then onto the counter. This has happened even though I now always make certain that the filter is placed correctly. If it drips onto the counter then you know that my day has started badly.
2,Brew & Go keep GOIN!!,"I purchased the Brew & Go because I have limited counter space and why use it all up when I am the only one in the house who drinks coffee. Figured this was the perfect choice because of the size and the make, everyone knows Black & Decker is a good name but I was wrong!Yes it's quick, yes it's small but the coffee doesn't taste like coffee, doesn't even smell like coffee while its brewing. Very disappointed and now I am still searching for a good, small coffee maker!"
3,Coffee Maker is v. useful but it looked like a used one,"I was waiting for Amazon to send me a msg to review this Coffeemaker because I was very disappointed to see all the scratches on it. But I don't feel that mad now as it has been almost a month. Don't how why Amazon asked my review so late. May be they thought by now my angry would be calm down. Anyway, for its price it is very useful product for me. I have no problems till now."
4,Good...but....,"Once you get the routine down, this baby brews up your coffee faster than you can say laxitive. However, there are 2 drawbacks. Personally I never use the perm. filters because after so long they get grimey. So you kind of have to fold a number 2 cone filter slightly to make it fit. It works though. Thats only if you dont use the basket filter. Second, I noticed I have to use a little more coffee than I normally would for the same amount to get that great taste (Seattle's Best). But other than those to easily avoidable problems. It works great"
4,"nice, with filter solution","this little gadget makes a fast, hot, good cup of coffee. Easy to operate. I don't like to mess with the goldfilter and the melitta #1 filters are hard to find and expensive, so I buy the #2 ones and cut off an inch - works great."
4,"Simple, efficient, priceless","I adore coffee but needed to cut down and this machine is perfect.I find most of the negatives people have expressed as inconsequential; the noise is delightful, it drips a little after it is finished brewing so I put an empty cup underneath, I simply wipe the grinds off of the inside top every day. I have used this daily since Nov 5, 2005 with Drip coffee from Intellignetsia or Newman's own French roast and have enjoyed every cup.I have an assortment of coffee makers that may brew better and hotter coffee but I use the Black and Decker one cup every day. I keep it upstairs in my two story house, stumble out of bed, push the button and it is ready by the time I brush my teeth and wash my face. If the mug were better I would give it five stars, I prefer the feel of my own ceramic mug.I recommend it without hesitation."
2,Disappointing...,"I bought this thing having read a few of the popular positive reviews here but having actually used it I have to say I'm very disappointed. First of all it takes too long. The light goes off and you think your coffees done - think again, the water will still come out for another 2-3 minutes. Secondly, the design is bad...The last few oz. of water are puffed through with these great gasps that has the affect of blasting your grounds all over the place. The top where the water comes out gets completely saturated with grounds and has to be cleaned every time."
2,Not what I expected.,I purchase this because I thought I would get more info then I could get from the website. It really was not what I was expecting. It does have good maps in it but that is about all it is good for.
2,Dont let the cover fool you!,Wasnt a very good or useful book. Didn't have a lot of the practical stuff in it!
4,"It's okay, esp for the price","I'm not disappointed, but I'm not buying the hype after trying it. It does help...don't get me wrong, but it's not that great like others claim. It seems to be a decent moisturizer and perhaps a very very slight improvement on fine lines. I would buy again, just cuz it's cheap."
5,Good stuff,This is pretty good.. worth buying.. you need only a small amount so this shld atleast last you for 45-50days!
5,Great product!,I've used this product for three years and it does all it claims. The Olay serum is my choice over the lotion. I am very satisfied with this product.
5,Best product ever !!!,"I really love Regenerist daily serum !!! It leaves my sking incredibly smooth and younger looking !! I sells a little pricey on my country, that's why I buy it online through Amazon."
3,Beware of the strong scent,"The strong, slightly floral scent of this serum was a big turn-off for me. I had used the fragrance-free regenerist serum in the past and bought the regular because it was a dollar cheaper. Big mistake. If you're at all fussy about scents, do your nose a favor and get the fragrance-free version. That said, the two serums work equally well and I'm very pleased with the results (smoother skin, etc). I even use it in the morning under my sunscreen to get more bang for the buck, so to speak."
5,"husbands, get this for your loved one","Olay has a charm few women can resist, and I can safely say my wife likes the day when she receives a amazon.com package containing something for her.The product itself (in my wife's word) is a fond reminder that she loves the fact that I care about her skin and get her the best product she can think of.From a pricing perspective, the item is highly priced but the quality is very good.Pros:Good quality which works good on skin.Wife acceptance factor is high.Cons:The size of the package is very small. Come on Olay, increase the size of the package and give us our money's worth (except when it is on sale with Subscribe and Save)"
4,Have not used long enough,"I have only used for 3 weeks and my skin seem to be some what smooth with less wrinkes,but time will tell. If I have seen a change this soon can you imagine the change in the next month."
4,So far so good,"I've been using this lotion for a couple of months now and so far so good. It feels good after I apply it on my face, smell good, but a little pricy."
3,Not as effective as claimed.,"Been using this for a few months now, and although it works great as a primer and a moisturizer, I have not noticed any decrease in the number of wrinkles or had any reduction in the fine lines around my eyes. I will not be purchasing again after it's used up."
2,Wanted to love this product...,"I really wanted to love this product, but every time I tried it, I would break out. I normally do not have issues with pimples and actually have dry skin, so I thought at first it must be something else or perhaps I was using too much. I would wait a week for my face to clear up, try again, and it would happen again."
2,NOT for oily skin,"I really wanted to like this but was disappointed. I gave it a couple of weeks to see if my skin would adjust, but today is probably the last day I'll use it. My skin is naturally slightly oily, but this made it SUPER greasy. It goes on nice and light, so that was surprising.Today as soon as I left work all I could think about was rushing home to wash my face! What's worse, I have broken out badly - big pimples that also itch, so not sure if it's a breakout or an allergic reaction - either way, no thanks. I might continue to use it under my eyes where my skin is drier just to see if it helps with the fine lines there (only because there are so many positive reviews), but definitely won't be using again on my face/neck/decolletage."
2,It does not seem to work for what its for.,"Good moisturizer. If it regenerates any, it would be my wrinkles and freckles because i did not see or feel any improvement (or maintenance) even after I used up the last drop."
1,Be very ware!,"I got a free sample of this serum in 2007 and after applying it on my face, the next morning I woke up with small blisters on my cheeks. Once the blisters broke they left my skin on my cheekbones very dark and I have not found anything that can clear them to date. I used to love Olay but had to quit using their products after that experience. The same thing also happened to a friend of mine."
5,My favorite skin product,"Keeps my skin feeling hydrated without feeling greasy or heavy. Gives me a nice smooth surface for applying makeup. Makeup goes on even. After long term use combined with Regenerist lotion at night, it seems to have made a slight improvement in the lines under my eyes and around my mouth. It is definitely my favorite skin product."
5,Good for Sensative Skin,I have sensative skin and have had a hard time finding a product I could use. This works for me.
1,Not great,I really wanted to notice a change in my face using this serum but I did not. Now I have happily moved on to other products.:)
2,Not equivalent to Department Store Serums,"Purchased this serum to replace my Estee Lauder Idealist that costs over forty dollars for the equivalent size. The first problem is the smell. I had purchased Olay's quench lotion before and hated the smell, never imaging they would use the same sent for the face. The second problem is the texture - it just felt like thin lotion and when it dried, it felt itchy. I didn't even try using it on my face because when I put it on my hand and smelled it, I knew I would not be able to tolerate that fragrance all over my face. I ended up washing my hands within 15 minutes. I guess I'll have to pay for the good stuff."
2,Eh.,I've used better products than this one. I am happy that I did not pay retail for this or I would have been quite upset.
5,Olay Offers a Great Product,"My wife uses Olay Regenerist on a daily basis and has told me that it really does a great job! Sometimes it can be a bit difficult to find in the larger size and it is not cheap, but the product just seems to work very well for her."
4,Great,"I normally use Signature Club from HSN and love the capsulated serums; however, I must say that the Olay Regenerist has visibly reduced the appearance of my ""laugh"" lines and has softened my skin. It is not as silky as the Signature Club serum and the fragrance isn't as nice, but I give it a thumbs up for reducing/plumping up the ""laugh"" lines around the eyes. We all like to look younger, right?!"
4,Extremely pleased!!,"This product has become a staple in my skin care regimen! It leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth and the results were noticeable after only a few days. I did try the regenerist eye as well, and honestly, it's a waste of money. This product is gentle enough for around the eyes and does a much better job. I had problems for years with white bumps around my eyes before I started using this product, and they have all cleared up and not returned. It's a tad bit sticky at first, but not bad enough to re-wash my face, and I'm very particular about anything greasy or sticky on my skin. Well worth a try. Great price, great product. A real winner!"
1,Be careful!,"If you have sensitive skin, beware. I tried a free sample and overnight it did make my skin baby soft, but then I broke out with huge under the skin blemishes. Ouch! It really irritated the skin around my eyes. I stopped using it right away and slowly it's going away. I was really disappointed. I had high hopes from the claims...just be careful."
4,soft and smooth,"THIS PRODUCT IS OK SO FAR, BEEN USING IT FOR ABOUT A MONTH..WHEN I USE IT MY FACE FEELS SOOOOO SOFT AN LOOKS SMOOTH AND EVEN..I HAVEN'T NOTICED A LOT OF WRINKLE REDUCTION BUT I DO TAN SO THIS MAY SLOW IT DOWN.IT SEEMS TO HAVE MADE SOME IMPROVEMENT, JUST NOT THE MIRACLE I WAS HOPING FOR. I WILL KEEP USING IT,MAYBE MORE TIME IS ALL I NEED FOR THAT MIRACLE. (SMILE)"
4,regenerating syrum,"This is a very good product, but after a couple of weeks I got a pink spot which I had had before,so I discontinued it. My skin is VERY sensitive and I guess something irritated it..."
2,Break outs!,I love Olay most of the time. This product caused breakouts for me. It was very heavy under my makeup.
1,Battery does not hold charge after 10 uses and 1 month!,"Bought it for my wife as a x-mas gift. Worked ""ok"" at first, although it is difficult to get it attached/started. We fully charged it in the cradle for ~36 hours then it only lasted about 5 cans in one week of use. Recharged it and still only got about 5 cans. The third time it did not even open one can. We are now trying to find the receipt and return it! Sounds like our experience is not unusal..."
4,kind of neat,"I bought this when we received two of the tall black and decker can openers for our wedding, neither which would open the cans we tried. So we traded them in on this little thing since we had received many applicances and didn't have extra room. I haven't taken it off of the charger much, it seems to be a bit tricky to get off and back on the charger- I just use it on there- it does hold the can well and opens them quickly. I think it is really neat that when off of the charger you can put it on the can, start it and just let it go, it just goes right around the can. I also like that if the power would go off, you could use it. I just hope it lasts a long time."
3,Handy but clunky,"The Gizmo works somewhat well, but can be hard to start on the lip of the can, and most of the time, when it's through, and U lift the arm to remove the can lid, the little arm w/the magnet wants to pop off. Slight bit of nusance. Also, unless it's always plugged in, resulting in an absolutely full charge, she will get a bit 'sleepy' after about the third can.Bought it for someone who has limited hand mobility, and she is unable (most of the time) to even load the Giz-no on to the lip. Resulting in me opening the can anyway, which is exactly what I was trying to avoid. I rate this as an 'Okay' item."
1,A piece of junk with a meaningless warranty.,"We received this can opener as a wedding gift 10 months ago. Today, the unit will no longer hold a charge and is completely useless. No problem. I figured I'd call Black & Decker's toll free number and invoke the product's ""full one year warranty."" Just one little catch. The warranty is based on a date code stamped on the unit's electrical plug, not on the date the gift was received. Apparently, our unit sat on the store shelf for a few months before it was purchased, and the ""full one year warranty"" is suddenly reduced to 3 months of coverage. Black & Decker refused to do anything to help us. So now, I'll refuse to spend any of my money on their products. I recommend you do the same."
5,I LOVE IT!!,"I got this for Christmas and it is awesome... The people who say it doesn't hold a charge must not be clicking it all the way in charger. Once you see how, it is extremely easy and it works like a charm. And I don't usually like electric can openers. I would recommend it highly and give it as presents. The design is also great and user friendly.. The best!!"
1,Short life,"This product faced two major problems -- (1) it was often difficult to align the opener on the can, but once it was attached, it worked very well...(2) though it held less and less charge over time, until six months after purchase, at which point the battery would not hold any charge."
5,Black & Decker GC200 Gizmo Can Opener,"Tried a few of these battery operated can openers. None of them worked out for me..Until I purchased this one... Easy to operate. First try and it opened the can with ease.. Have had it a month now, and have opened every size can you can think of. Never had a problem. Even with a small tomato paste can..After a month, it is still operating on its first charge..Very happy with this purchase."
1,Gizmo Dud,"Bought this for my wife who has had extensive wrist surgery. It has been a disaster from day one. It is nearly impossible to position on any size can, rarely ""bites"" into the lid, and requires multiple attempts to complete its relatively simple task; opening cans. It was cute the few times it did work, but cute is not reliable. Also, as others have noted, the Gizmo does not hold a charge for more than a few hours regardless of how many attempts were made to open a can. Black and Decker should remove this appliance from their line up of typically well designed and constructed tools. Basically worthless."
3,Not B&D's Standard Quality,"It worked great at first. But having a family of 4 I open LOTS of veggie cans. After about 2 months it's started weakening. It holds enough ""juice"" but sounds like it's straining to get around the can. Glad I only paid $19 for it. I'll use it until it completely dies though."
4,My favorite can opener,The Gizmo is the best can opener I've ever had. Its easy to use and easy to clean. I had one for about 5 years and was very upset when I dropped it and it broke. I couldn't find it anywhere but was thrilled when I found it on Amazon. It was easy to buy online and was delivered quickly.
4,BD Gizmo GC200 Can Opener,"The Gizmo GC200 can opener works well. We replaced an Eco cordless can opener with this one. Overall, we are happy with the way it operates. It should be mounted on a wall for it to look its best. We did not mount it because the procedure looked too involved and we did not trust it to stay on the wall considering how you have to unsnap it to take the Gizmo out to open a can. We thought after time the plaster holding it would loosen, so we keep it on the counter. It definately looks odd that way, but its usable. Using it on very small cans can be a little ackward to manage. My husband is a left hander and it is definately not left hander friendly."
3,Black and Decker Gizmo,"this opener is easier for older individuals to use who have common age-related hand conditions. However, the charger set up is somewhat difficult to use. The charges do not last for a busy week's work of use as we recycle all cans."
2,"Cute, but not worth it","I've had two of these things. I bought the first Gizmo, and it lasted less than a year. The second, a gift, lasted a little longer -- then it just stopped charging. Even before it died, it took a lot of effort to fit it onto the can, especially a narrow one. We didn't use it all that often, either, what with most cans having flip-top lids. I do like the way you can save space by hanging the charger unit from a cabinet, but I can't recommend this product. I'm surprised B&D is still making it."
4,hard to figure out,"The opener was hard to figure out but once I got the nack of it, It worked great!"
2,Doesn't last,"I got this can opener as a gift. On one hand I like the way it takes less space by wall mounting and giving me more space on my countertop. I didn't really like using it that much, it was messy. If you let it cut completely around the can, the lid would pop up and sauces or whativer would splatter, or the lid would fall into the can. We kept the opener on the charger and so never really lost the charge. However, after less than a year the can opener seems charged but doesn't have enough power to cut the can after it pierces it - just doesn't move. Take it off the can and it seems like it has full power.I wouldn't recommend it. I got my old electric opener back out."
1,Stopped working,The Gizmo worked fine at first but within a month wouldn't hold a charge strong enough to open anything. Black and Decker has been of no help replacing it either!
1,zzzzZZZZZZzzzz z z z ...,"you could die of starvation waiting for a can of tuna to open with this thing. sssssllllloooooowwwwww!!! and complicated, just for extra fun."
1,Very hard to use!,I bought this for my daughter who has four children two and under and is always opening cans. It is very difficult to use. It falls apart when trying to open a can. Very dissappointed because it looked like a good product.
1,"Huge step backwards, B&D blew this one","I had a cordless Black & Decker can opener for years that finally gave out. I figured the Gizmo was just the latest version of that, so I bought one. Big mistake on my part.This thing struggles to open cans, is difficult to mount and won't hold a charge. you can it even charge it while it is in the wall holder.I really like cordless openers and as soon as I find another, the gizmo is going into the trash."
5,Gizmo Can Opener is great!,"The Gizmo can opener is a great buy, as soon as I received it I put it to use and I'm able to open any type of can easily. I will definately recommend this product to friends and family."
1,Piece of junk!!!,"Well, its official - I've owned my Gizmo about one year and it has gone kaput! It ran out of juice, I totally decharged it, then placed it in the charger for 24 hours, no power. I tried to open a can with it in the charger, no go. The Gizmo is now in the trash - give me a cheapo plug in opener any day - much more reliable."
3,works great-dies tosoon!,The gizmo worked great while it worked but it died within a year. I loved this can opener while it was working. It held a charge great and worked every time. However within a year it completely died. I have been very hesitate to buy another one. It works great but the price is too high to replace it every year. I have read similar complaints about this and other black and decker can openers so I just don't know what to buy.
1,Don't pay for a gizmo,"I received a Gizmo can opener for Christmas almost 2 years ago. By the time my husband put it up, it was in use for over 1 year.Two months ago, it died on me. I do not recommend it for anyone. IIt is also awkward to use!"
2,More trouble than it is worth,This sounded like a nice little can opener especially for people with arthritis. Well you have to make sure it is in the charger just right or it won't charge and that takes some maneuvering. Both hands. Same with getting it out of the charger. It may be easier if you mount it under the cabinet. Anyway the lever also comes out easily for cleaning but almost always came off while I was putting it on the can. A manual can opener would have worked and I would be done with opening the can in less time. I used it for 3 months and got a Cusinart Die Cast.
1,"Back to the Drawing Board, B&D!","I have carpal tunnel in both hands and can't open a can using a manual can opener. I don't have alot of room in my kitchen so I didn't buy an electric one. Basically, I stopped buying cannned foods unless they had the pull-top tab on the cans.I received the Gizmo as a Christmas gift. I'd never heard of it so when I opened the box, I was thrilled. That feeling didn't last long, unfortunately.I can't remember how many tries it took to get the Gizmo on the can correctly. Finally, though, I did and it was fun to watch it work. Unfortunately, that was the last time it did. Afterwards, I was never able to get it on the can properly - usually the part that cuts the can lid would fall off. (Or fly off, more accurately). I finally gave up and tossed the ole Giz.I thought B&D; invented the Gizmo for people who couldn't use a manual can opener - the elderly or disabled. If this is the case, B&D; really blew it. It was a good idea - but the design sucks."
1,Great while the batteries last,The Gizmo uses 2 2.4V rechargeable NiCd batteries that are impossible to find anywhere but directly from Black & Decker. Mine lasted about a year and they quoted me $21 plus shipping for new batteries. Do yourself a favor and get an opener that uses ordinary batteries instead if you want a cordless.
1,Wasted a day,"Read all directions for the Gizmo then proceeded with the charging of this ""handy-dandy hands free"" gadget. My first try at opening a can ... black chunks of plastic fell on my cabinet. It's broken; what a joke for a can opener!"
1,not so hot,"Simply put it won't open big cans like a coffee can. When you remove it from the holder and put it on a coffee can it just sits there and does not go around the can and it you put the can on the opener it won't go around unless you grab a hold of it and assist it, motor not strong enough."
1,worthless,"We have both the can opener and the cheese grater. They both worked a few times and quit holding a charge. I ran both batteries down and recharged. The can opener will be thrown away in the morning, the cheese grater appears to be okay for now, but does not have the power it did. Both are about three months old. These products are worthless!"
2,"Looks nice, can't charge when in base","Contrary to the amazon.com product description: ""The opener is lightweight and recharges in a compact, 6-3/4-by-5-1/2-inch plastic charging base that can be mounted on a wall (mounting hardware included), set on the counter, or placed in a drawer.""The opener cannot be charged when it is in its ""charging base"". The charger plugs into the opener itself and the opener will not fit in the base when the charger is plugged in. I have it sitting on the counter and the base in is the attic in the box.It looks nice but is not as functional as the old model B&D; that lasted me 10 years and had a proper charging base."
2,Disappointed,"I own many Black & Decker tools and have been very happy with them. However I was very disappointed with the Gizmo. It worked pretty well for about two months, then it would not take a charge or work at all.I have not been able to find any online service help either."
3,Is this a joke?,"It's not April 1st, but this must be a joke! I bought one of these years ago for $10 at Bed, Bath & Beyond. Can this be the same can opener? One thing I CAN tell you however - it still works fine! But not for $169!"
2,works great ...not durable,works great....but dropped it from my hand onto carpeted floor and of course it broke.unusable now but all the openers i see on line here are rated even lower then this so whats a person to do?Target better get a more dependable brand on here if you wanna keep your net customers.
2,not durable,this opener fell probably 4 feet to a carpeted floor and broke a piece off so now it dont go down enough to even cut.for the money it should withstand about anything.
1,Save your money,"I have owned this unit for over a year now. It's useless, the motor is too weak and the battery life is very short. Half the time it can't open a can even when it is plug directly into it charger. I have to pull the can out and use a hand opener."
4,Love it,"I have the gizmo, have had for about a year, and I absolutely love it. I went out and bought one for our church's kitchen. It is easy to use, opens all kinds of cans, and exactly what I was looking for. I have never had problems getting it to hold a charge, and it has always locked onto whatever can I am opening and opened it right up. I have a home daycare, and a family of 6, so I do a lot of cooking, and it gets a lot of use. I am going to be buying one for my mother who has problems with her hands and finds herself struggling with a manual opener."
2,Never charged when you need it!!,"I had one of these and when you put it in the drawer, it would turn on if it was pushed up against something else...therefore, when you needed to open a can, it was always dead. So you're at the mercy of the charger in order to open a CAN!! It also wouldn't do small cans like tuna and mushrooms...only regular size cans. I threw it away and bought a $3 manual. Don't waste your money. The only cool thing about it is that you just set it down and it opens the can....which isn't such a cool feature when your hungry for soup and your gizmo is dead."
5,Love my black Gizmo,This is the second Black and Decker Gizmo I have bought. It is very compact but does a big job. I love the way that it will stay charged for a month and I can open any size can in any part of the kitchen.
1,NICE WHILE IT LASTED,"This is a piece of junk. Worked great when I first received it for a Christmas present in 2001. When it lost its charge, I followed the instructions and left it to charge. It never would recharge and has been in the drawer ever since! The warranty was useless. Back to using the $6.00 ...hand opener which works every time!"
4,Great Product!,"I agree that this product takes some getting used to. Initially, it can be difficult to mount it on a can. It takes some practice to snap it into its charger. And it takes some patience to learn how NOT to have the handle/blade separate from the rest of it. But it took me no time at all to figure out how best to use it. And it works great! No charging issues, no problems with various can sizes. It's fun to watch, too. How many other functional novelties can you find in a kitchen? I recommend this product without reservation."
2,not like it promised,I thought it was cute & it did work really good for first few times but not now. It is so hard to get the point onto the top of the can. you have to turn it (the can)on it's side to get it in the right spot. It is not easy. A regular can opener is so much better.
2,Its fun to watch.... IF you can get it on the can!,"I got this little guy for christmas, paying almost 20.00 for a can open seemed outragous, but I fell for the advertising ploy that made it look so easy. I havnt had a problem with keeping a charge or it making it around large cans IE: Coffee. But its rather difficult to get it to latch on to the can. Once its on there its fine. Also had the problem with the magnetic arm part falling off... I dont know why they didnt just connect that piece. *shrugs* Youre better off getting something else!"
3,duribilty of parts,"I love the flixibilty of the product. I,however,have a problem with the durability of the parts. The plastic sleeve of the blade/handle of mine broke and will not allow the blade to swing down and open cans. if there is areplacement part at a nominal fee,please let me know. I was pleased with all other aspect of it."
1,Gizmo is hard to handle,"My Gizmo is extremely hard to position, to get it started cutting. After 4 or 5 tries, I finally get it started - but it's very frustrating. Also, since it lacks a handle, it is hard to handle while trying to position it.I'm getting rid of it, and ordering a different model."
1,can does not open fully,"The opener only opens the can to the end. At that point I have to tear the last bit of the lid off by hand.This creates a hazard to the fingers rounding the lid. I have gone back to my old opener that does not put my fingers in trouble. I thought the gizmo was a great idea but since it is a hazard to my fingers, I will never tell any body to buy one.It is a great idea but let me know when it works like the old time electric openers do.I am sorry I lost [$$]plus on a christmas present for my househl9o"
2,Gizmo not for big can's,The Gizmo is ok for small can's . But getting it started on a small can is a pain.For a large can it dose not have the power to open them . Part way through it will stop.The Gizmo is a good idea but it needs work. Black & Decker is a good name so i think thay could do it.
2,"Well, it worked great...for about 2 months.","I really liked this opener. While it lasted.After about 2 months of use, a rivet worked loose so the opener wouldn't grip any can.I called B&D; Customer Service. They gave me an RMA number and said they'd send me a replacement. It only took 6 weeks and two phone calls to get a replacement.Glad I didn't toss my old hand-cranked opener!"
2,Won't hold a changre,"I first saw the Gizmo on TV and had to have it. I bought it about 11 months ago and it worked ok for a few months. It kept loosing it's charge. It was hard to put it in the cradle but I put it in and held it for an hour and it would not open a can. It stayed on the charger for 3 days and would not open a can. I have returned to my manual can opener, a P-38."
5,B&D Gizmo,I was very happy with the product. the prioce was good and the delivery was on time and timely.
5,The great gizmo,This opener works great. Very easy to use and maintain. I charged it up when I first got it and have been running on the same charge for about 6 months with no problems at all no matter what size can I open. Would recommend to anybody.
2,Can't charge in charger,Why in the world would anyone build a charging base when it is impossible to charge the can opener in it?Perhaps some one in the engineering department could explain that.
1,gizmo is not as good as old hand-cranked opener!,"I'm an electronics tech, my husband is a mechanic. He gave this to me for Christmas last year. We both tried to make this thing work, but it's really more effort than it's worth. I'm just glad it wasn't very expensive!"
4,Not bad,"I received this as a gift, and it quickly replaced my old under-the-counter opener.Pros: Once you figure out how to position it, it never fails to take lids off cleanly and effectively.It's very light, and small enough not to get in the way.It fits in the hand well, and is comfortable to use.Easy to clean.Cons: Mine didn't come with a docking station/recharger base deal, I just have a cord. I had to rig a hanger from the slot in the top.The whole cutting section at the top is made to unlock and come off if you turn it all the way up; well, it comes off too easily. It's annoying when I try to fit it on a lid and it pops off."
1,Poor Quality,"At first, this can opener was wonderful. Having two dogs and about a zillion cans to open each month, I was happy to have such an easy and accesible tool. But it kept breaking! The magnetic part of our gizmo kept getting warped and wouldn't hold onto the cans anymore. We tried exchanging them twice but it kept happening and now my gizmo resides in the dump."
1,Piece of Junk,"This is the biggest piece of junk I ever purchased. After attempting to make this ""junk"" work for over a year, I threw it in the garbage. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CAN OPENER IT DOESN'T WORK"
2,Terrific Item,"The Black & Decker Gismo Electric Can opener is a terrific addition to kitchen tools. It is easy to use, handy, and a great improvement over the old style can openers. A great gift for others AND for yourself!"
2,Gizmo,"Interesting concept, dies quickly, bought because I have little space in my kitchen, had an under the counter kind, and it was too close to toaster and coffee maker, and it melted, so I thought this would be perfect...not quite...maybe if/when Black and Decker comes up with a NEW & IMPROVED model with a stronger, longer lasting motor..."
1,Wrong product sent,I also received a box of Cyan ink and NOT a repair kit (same as previous reviewer). Obviously the vendor is still confused.
4,How might these 14 practical activities grow your business?,"Ron Finklestein has accomplished a significant feat. He's studied dozens of successful companies and identified the 14 key antributes that make them so profitable. And, he's distilled this knowledge into a practical guide that uses real English, not techno-consultant-academic speak.Buy it. Read it. Live it. Be profitable and grow."
5,Real Life Success,"This is a book that is a documentation of what real life small business people do to be successful. I love this because it doesn't necessarily talk about big companies that small business owners can never experience or touch, but small to medium sized businesses with limited resources and a lot of passion. That's what makes this worth getting. There are real stories in the book, and little ""summaries"" and exercises that you can work on while you're reading. Try it."
4,Monroe MA824 Shocks,"Purchased shocks for 2002 Olds Silo. They worked great. These replacements we're slightly smaller in diameter than originals. However, they work fine."
2,Did not fit my car as specified,"Although others said this fit their 2002 Pontiac Montana, the airlines did not fit and I only learned this after taking them to my mechanic to get them installed. I just ordered the separate adapter kit and hopefully that does the trick. I'm hoping these work because the OEM shocks are junk and I've been through 3 sets (luckily all died just before their warranty expired) and I'm hoping these last longer once they finally get installed.Amazon should not say the adapter lines come with these shocks, as it does not, and also recommend the separate adapter kit (Monroe AK29 )be purchased."
4,Great shocks...sleeve not assembled properly into mount bushing on one shock (both ends),"the seller was great. The product arrived right away in new condition. Packaging was not damaged. Product was well packaged. One issue out of many parts ordered. One of the shocks had a factory defect in which the metal sleeves were not completely pressed into position within the rubber bushing. They were left sticking out 1/4"" on one side and recessed on other side. The defect was found on both ends of the shock. This made the ends of the shock too large to fit within the vehicle mounting brackets. Luckily I was able to press the sleeves into place with an arbor press and use the product."
1,Fire hazard,"This coffee maker worked fine for a few months, and then sparks flew out of the base when you tried to turn it on. What a major piece of junk."
1,short life span,I purchased two of these on sale .. one for basement and one for kitchen. Kitchen one died in two months. i wrote Black & Decker and was told to take into a service department to have it fixed. Not worth it to me. I replied that i would just purchase another and I will make sure it is not a Black & Decker. I had gotten them on sale at very good price but think I will spend a little more and look at these reviews first.
1,Died in 6 months,"I liked this coffee pot... I really did... makes good coffee... can set the auto off from 2-4 hours, has a timer, and is pretty cheap.Really cheap in fact. 4 months after purchase the auto-off feature stopped working correctly shutting off after 2hrs no matter what the setting. Then, last week, 6 months after purchase, it just stopped working. You push ""on"" the little light comes on... and nothing happens... nothing...At least it still turned off after two hours.I wouldn't recomend buying this. If it was 10 bucks, maybe... but for [price], there are much better ones out there."
2,"Well designed, does not last","Bought this coffee maker, had it for less than a year, had problems getting to work a couple of times, then it stopped working all together. I emailed their customer service and was instructed to send the cord along with money for postage and handling. I followed the instructions, and that was the last I heard until I tried to get back in touch with them. I had been a good four months. When I finally got a response to my emails, the only thing they could tell me is I would have to phone their customer service line between 9 and 5 Monday to Friday. I work 9 to 5 Monday to Friday. I will be buying a new machine, and it will not be a Black and Decker."
1,Wish I had read the reviews first...,"I purchased the Black and Decker Smart Brew DCM2075 12 cup coffee maker just 5 weeks ago. I chose this model because it was a Black and Decker, it was mid-price at the discount store where I bought it, it promised good coffee plus it was attractive. Since the very first cup it ever brewed, this machine has been a disappointment. It spits and sputters as though it's on it's last breath, and it's SLOW. Two days ago I pushed the ""on"" button and it flew sparks at me, I believe the switch is burned out. I contacted the manufacturer and was told to return it to them for repairs, to me this is a huge inconvenience. If you're considering this appliance, my advice is don't buy it. Read the reviews...I wish I had."
2,"Well, it still kinda works","We've had ours for a little more than a year, and the switch is broken. We can still get it to brew, but only with a cup holding the switch down. You'd expect better from Black and Decker. I would not recommend this product."
1,A dud,"I bought this coffeemaker at Christmas based on the name of Black and Decker. (A good name.) However, the pot did not work from day one and I had to send it back. I will be buying another pot but not a B&D. Thanks."
1,We have had this just one year,"And already it is broken. My husband and I use the coffeemaker just a little in the summer, so there hasn't been that much use, but as the mornings get cooler, we have started using it more. The problem that we have found with the coffeemaker is the switch. I went to turn it on and it just snapped out of position and from what we understand it is non-repairable. I would definatly go with a more expensive version, because most of the time it it true that you get what you pay for.."
1,This is a terrible coffee maker,"Black and Decker usually makes pretty high quality kitchen appliances. In this case, they came up with a dud! I was very disappointed in this product - it stopped working after a few months."
2,Not the best vanity,"The assembly for this toy was ok---some of the screws aren't placed in the best spot, but the items that come with the vanity are junk!! Even the hairdryer has to be assembled, and all accessories are extrememly cheap. I ended up tossing all the items that came with it. My daughter is easily impressed at 4, but I wouldnt give it to an older girl."
3,Fun for Kids but not well made,"My daughter loves this and uses it all the time, but due to the way it is packaged there are a few sharp plastic edges that can cause cuts (luckily none yet)."
3,Making changes,"This is the story of Terri who has moved back home after the end of a ten year relationship. She has come to realize that she has put off many things she would like to do in her life while she was waiting for things to improve between her and her ex-partner. She can't wait any longer for some of the things she wants and the first of those is a baby. She finds a doctor who is willing to work with her and during the process, a new lover...her doctor, Aubrey. The book deals with the developing pregnancy and the relationship, which is complicated by their fears about trusting someone else, the appearance of both ex-lovers who want to try again and an automobile accident that could end everything they are hoping to achieve. The writing is simplistic and things seem to develop too rapidly to be realistic, not to mention a possible conflict of ethics about a doctor sleeping with her patient, but it's a better than average story."
1,"Save your $20, and choose another better one","I have used it for one month, and I have bad experience. It can't make an even grind. The coffee you made will be suck.Save you $20, and choose a $50 one, such as Braun KMM30."
5,Best Blade Grinder,"I am glad to see this grinder back on the market after a few years absence. Mine is the Starbucks' brand, but it is a Bosch. Unfortunately, Starbucks switched to the Capresso grinder, so I had a hard time finding the Bosch until recently. I have had other blade grinders, but none as consistant as the Bosch. It is not a match for a good burr grinder, but for [the money] what do you expect? As with any blade grinder, one must experiment to get the preferred grind. The Bosch has a unique slanted grind chamber that keeps the beans in the path of the blades. It is well made and reliable. I have had mine over twelve years ... no problems whatsoever. Unless you need a burr grinder for espresso or you are such a perfectionist that you won't settle for anything else, I highly recommend the Bosch blade grinder."
2,Grinds fast but not thoroughly,"This grinder grinds very quickly, possibly due to the slanted bottom surface. However, I have found that it is difficult to get the beans evenly ground. If I grind for a short time most of the grind consistency is just right, but somehow I always end up with a few beans that have gone untouched. If I grind a little bit longer, the beans get too powdery and this does not make good coffee. Also is somewhat small on capacity and as someone else said, the lid does not fit tight at all. One additional minor point - the cord does not have any strain relief. I would guess that after a year or two of wrapping and unwrapping it around the grinder, it will begin to crack where it goes into the base of the grinder."
2,Less than Delighted,"I liked this book less than either of its predecessors, Captivated and Fascinated. The Nikki Donovan story worked best for me; the Bertrice Small really didn't. I don't buy these anthologies for great romance -- I'm looking for a hot, interesting collection of stories. Here, frankly, the stories just weren't hot and interesting enough. I don't know whether the editors have changed since the first two historical erotic romance anthologies, but I was disappointed in both this and the first contemporary anthology put out by Brava."
4,Out of the Storm by Susan Johnson is delightful,"Susan Johnson's contribution to the anothology collection of stories to Delighted impressed me far more than her latest novel, Brava (Again and Again). In Out of the Storm, two strangers seek shelter from a storm in a gamekeeper's hut, finding instant passion with each other. Introduced formally two weeks later they discover a relationship by marriage (his father recently wed her mother). Ms. Johnson did an excellent job describing the characters' emotions: lust, shame, bewilderment, pride and pain. I would recommend Delighted for this story only."
5,99% Off!! Sign Me Up!,"Originally a $1069 basketball can be yours for 99% off now!!! Wow! You will be saving only $1054.95. Get this deal while you can. Rumor has it, this ball features a core of solid gold."
3,"Good basketballs, arrived late",These basketballs were as described. Didn't have a problem with the balls but the late arrival was a problem because a ex pro ABA basketball player was going to sign them for me. Since they did not arrive on time I couldn't get them signed. Very disapointing.
5,Stephen Turnbull is a guarantee of quality,"This is a short but excellent and very comprehensive account of the Mongol warriors who terrorized Asia and Europe in the 13th century. Turnbull analyses many topics including weapons, armour, tactics, siege warfare, the Mongol horses and above all the everyday life of those infamous warriors. I think this is the best introduction one can have on the subject and, if he is fascinated by these people and their campaigns, he should go a step further, reading James Chambers' magnificent book ""The Devil's Horsemen""."
4,Introductory Circuit Analysis,Good book. Easy to understand and comprehend. Very helpful for a beginner.
5,This is in my top 10 now hilarious,Great laughs i was never bored i usually fallout with animes if i dont like the first 3 episodes. This one gave me good laugh im suprise because i gave this one a chance i never heard about it from anyone its worth a watch.
2,Not what I expected,"I like anime...all types, so I decided to watch this one b/c it looked funny and from the synposis I figured it would somewhat keep my interest...It turned out to be very annoying and dry...I found myself dosing off a few times trying to get through this 25min show...I don't think it's worth watching"
5,Hope to Own it When I Have the Money,"I don't care for the price of it, but this is a five-star anime right here. I'd love to have it in my library :)"
5,Entertaining as can be,"Honestly, this type of humor isn't for most individuals. But the love/romance/high-school flirtatiousness is nailed spot-on. I recommend this to anyone who can laugh about anything. Lots of moments where you will say what the h*ll are you thinking? But you have to keep watching for more. I haven't checked to see if this is available outside of Amazon Instant video, but I would highly recommend this as an AI video purchase. All I have left to say is oh Yamada!"
5,Logitech Wireless Music System forPC,"If you want to play music over your home music system from your PC this is the wireless system for you. It is not fancy but it does one thing well, it works. I am a 72 year old computer dummy but it only took me about 15 minuets to have this thing up and running. I hear that Logitech is not going to continue to produce this systemm but is going to come out with an improved version. That will probably mean a more complicated version that costs more and is more difficult to get up and running. New does not always mean better as I have discovered over the years. If they were smart they would leave the thing on the market and advertise it more so more people would know it exists. I think that then they would sell more of them. All I can say is, ""buy it""."
5,'more than I expected...,Outstanding performance just as described. I use the Logitech wireless system from my laptop anywhere in the house with the base and beam my music with no decline in music quality to my house BOSE system. I am very satisfied and may purchase another base or give one as a gift.
2,poor sound quality,"Initially when I saw this product I was very thrilled, but after using it for the first the, I am very disappinted by the sound quality you get when use this wireless device. Would not recommend."
5,Easy In...Easy On!,"There's no trick to this baby. Plug it into your usb port, plug the supplied RCA cables to the aux port of your stereo and wireless receiver and off you go. The only hard thing about using this setup is deciding what to broadcast next to your stereo! No software required. When you want to listen to your PC speakers, just unplug the usb transmitter...simple!"
2,extends to 330 feet? Maybe 50' at best,The system works awesome as long as I don't try to transmit beyond about 50 feet. They advertise 330 feet. That sucks!
3,good value but limited use,"I bought the logitech through a supplier in New Zealand, both because it had good reviews and was a good price. We use it to broadcast our iTunes library to the home stereo.I was unable to source multiple receivers (as advertised) in New Zealand, so I had to purchase a second receiver from the US. I didn't think that was cool.More importantly, I understood the phrase ""Expand your system to multiple rooms. Music receivers for additional speaker systems are available."" to mean that the same music could be played in different rooms simultaneously. The fact that my wife and I cannot listen to music while one is in the lounge and the other in the office is disappointing."
4,Great product,"This is a great product, especially for the Amazon price. Don't load software as others have said.I do wish I could use it to shoot to several speaker sets at time, otherwise it would be a 5 star instead of the 4 I gave it. But it is great and plug and play. I have bought a second one for my house and bought one as a present for my brother."
2,Ready to use -- if you're lucky,"Despite of the ramdom problems reported on the reviews, I thought I'd be lucky enough to have this little device working properly at home. I wasn't. It worked great for the first 5-10 minutes, then sound gradually starts to fail until mute. After trying out several configurations, turning on/off all other devices around, etc., I tried to pair it with native bluetooth in my PC. And that did the trick. It works fine now. Just wondering what I'm going to do with the rest of the pack (transmissor, usb cradle, remote control, all useless...)."
4,Logitech music system,"The item works well and very easy to install. I am totally dissatisfied with Amazon's pricing. The price went down $15 in 2 weeks,but they wouldn't adjust price.This is the last time I purchase from Amazon!!!!"
2,Gradual degradation of transmission,"This item is no longer offered or supported by Logitech - you can't find a single mention of it on their website or knowledge base. Why? I think because of major quality control problems.My unit would work fine for 5-10 minutes, but dropouts would always begin and soon would occur every 3-4 seconds. I don't have a cordless phone, I turned off my Wireless-G router and my bluetooth Skype phone, and still the problem occurred. Others have reported the same issue on the Logitech discussion forum.[...]It's too bad, because when the unit did work, it was great and did exactly what I was looking for."
5,Just what I was looking for.,"This is what I was looking for and more. I wanted a small and simple device to play music through my stero from my laptop without connecting wires. This does just that and the setup was completely painless. The remote is a super nice bonus. I expected I would have to be at the laptop to control the music, but the remote allows me to control volume and skip through the tracks in the playlist from anywhere in the room. It also works for Pandora, an internet radio station I often use."
3,Not what I thought it was,"What they dont tell you is When you turn it on all your computer sound is sent to the reciever. There is no sound at your pc.I wanted to send the music to my stereo in the other room, which it does well,but I also wanted the music at my PC.You can't do that with this product."
2,Wireless????,"The idea of wireless sounds fantastic, just try to get it work,,,,I have done everything according to the instruction and have notbeen able to make it work,,,It is back in the box just the way it came,,,as i said it just soundeda good idea,,,"
1,Wi-fi hotsopt destroyed.,"I was so happy hearing music from my laptop on my hi-fi speakers, I cannot tell...Until I discovered my 54g wi-fi hotspot was not working properly.It seems to me that I am to choose either the internet or the music.Is Logitech to blame? I guess so, since I have tried with different chanels in my router without being able to surfe the net anymore...until I disconnected the Logitechwireless system.I cannot believe such a mistake, Logitech."
5,One of those products that actually works as advertised.,Excellent no hastle setup. I'm compelled to write this review because this product is so good that it deserves the positive press. Excellent. Don 't hesitate on this one.
4,hope this help you decide,"I read the reviews and was a bit concern about the phone interference with the device. I decide to go ahead and buy it anyway. So far, I am very pleased with it. Installation was very easy. It works well (note: my transmitter and receiver is only approx 30 feet apart with one wall). I do not have any issue with the device with the exception that when you plug in the device to the pc, the pc speakers do not produce any sound. If you want to use the pc speaker again, you have to disconnect the device from the pc."
1,"Waste of Money ""NEVER BUY LOGITECH""","I got this Logitech MusicAnywhere v1.1 from woot and as other people mentioned it stopped working after 2 months for NO REASON. Now, I have Mac and Windows 7. Logitech doesn't have any driver updates for this device. Only XP and Vista are supported OS. I WILL NEVER BUY ANY LOGITECH DEVICES. This is the simply trashing your money in the drain. All I can use from it extended USB Cable which comes for 3 bucks. WORTHLESS PRODUCT No Support. Flawed Design."
4,Logitech Wireless Music System for PC,"Great product, Looses sound sometimes but 99.9% of the time works perfect can't complain. Will Recommend anytime to anyone"
5,First impression is great!,"Just set it up, took all of 10 minutes. Didn't install the software CD. Works great! I am using it to transmit the music on my computer outside to my shed about 50 feet away where I have a stereo. In doing so, it is transmitting through 3 walls, and it comes in crystal clear. Remote has decent range too, at about 40 feet for me. I love it so far."
4,Works almost as advertised,"Works pretty well, except the software was a failure. When plugged to a USB port without installing the software, it works fine. Installation of the software led to an inability to turn the thing off. I uninstalled the software, and it was fine. To turn on, just plug it in. To turn off, unplug it."
2,"Nice idea, but...",Setup was very simple: plug in the components and go. Problem was that the music transmission was never without a 'stutter'. I tried it with different computers and different stereo systems and could never get it to produce a clear signal. I ended up returning it.
2,Lack of support,"I thought this product would provide a way for my husband to listen to internet radio in another room while I am working on the PC. That's what Logitech says it will do. So far, it seems to be doing that without problems.BUT! I had problems with installation. The software does not recognize my computer or my sound card, so I can't select either of them as ""default"" unless I go to control panel>sounds and audio devices>audio tab>sound playback> default device.I WAS able to send Windows Media Player output to this device in the media player itself. (Go to library> more options> devices> speakers> properties> sound playback and choose this device.) Other applications (such as iTunes) do not have that option for use.Sound confusing and difficult? Yep. Buyers beware... there is NO support from Logitech for this product. The only support I found was at the users forum:[...]Good luck."
3,Bad reception,"This uses bluetooth to communicate between your PC and reciver, the coverage for bluetooth is very spotty, the music will play beautifully for first 3-5 mins (as it buffers the music for continues play) but after first few mins the songs will break. For me it was so bad that I coudn't get it work no matter how close I put my laptop. I had to finally return this.I am giving this device 3 stars because you cannot beat the simplicity in design and ease of use for this price. It would have been great product if the music quality was good."
2,Defaut Settings,The unit comes with the default setting that turns off the computer speakers with the Logitech unit installed. No mater what I do both remote and computer speakers will work at the same time. It is one or the other.I find this unaceptable. I whish I had returned it.To be fair the remote feature works just fine.
5,One of the best things I ever bought at Amazon,"I bought this music system without reading the reviews first, and I was a little worry about the review which says something about the over heating. I use it for hours and doesn't get hot, sounds great, and has an excellent range."
4,It works...,I have not yet installed the software that comes with this product. It worked right out of the box. Setup was very easy. I would buy this product again.
4,Logitech Wireless Music System,This is an excellent system for those who wish to send music wirelessly from their computer song library to another sound system. Like all Logitech systems it is very easy to set up and works well. It is moderately priced and has no frills. They have a more expensive system for those who want the music information on their remote. I like Logitech. Their products are well made and the set up is easy.
4,Great Digial Gizmo,"I just got this little device as a gift from my wife. It is easy to set up. Just plug in the USB device and attach the receiver to the stereo and you are up and running. The sound quality is quite clear and it reproduces deep rich bass accurately. I have wireless everything in my house including bluetooth, WiFi, microwave and I have experienced no problems with interference whatsoever.HOWEVER- the software that comes with it is a waste of time. It is confusing and clunky and I had to reinstall Winamp as a result of it. at least you do not need the software to run the device. Also, the remote seems to have compadibility problems with Winamp. It will not advance songs. It works perfectly with WinMedia. That is my only gripe."
4,Good product for a great price,Works quite well. It worked out of the box for me. Simple to use.Remote is kind of small. Not bad for the price. Cannot select randomly from a playlist but that functionality is in more expensive products. Good product for simple streaming of music.
2,Just Didn't Work,"I bought the Wireless Music System for PC with high hopes. Unfortunately, it never worked for me. After trying multiple computers and postions from within my home I gave up after several hours.Returning the system was very easy and I received a full refund nearly instantly however.Perhaps this was bad luck with a single unit, I am tempted to give it another shot."
3,Nice but...,"If you can't run cable somewhere this is nice. But you cannot READ: CANNOT connect to multiple receivers at one time. The other downfall is that it locks down your computer speakers so you can't hear it there.Sound quality, great, ease of setup great... now let me stream music to lots of sources including my computer and we're set."
3,"Works well, most of the time","works well, most of the time. sometimes, i will hear a buzzing in my new onkyo sound system. i'm not sure if it's the reception. i do not have my router setup at the moment, and my phones are 5.8 ghz. when it does not have a buzzing, works well and very simple to setup."
4,good product,"Good product. It works great using a computer on the 2nd floor and hooking up to the surroud sound on the 1st floor. It does, however, have some compatability issues with the new winamp. I had to roll back to the later version in order to use all of the features on the remote."
2,Nice idea NOT for Windows Vista,I purchased this item for a Windows Vista Machine. There was no information regarding compatibility. It will work but you can only use the speakers to which it is attached. You can not use the pc speakers and the stereo speakers at the same time. You must first unplug the USB transceiver in order to use the pc speakers. Logitech has no updated drivers for Vista.
1,Logitech should be ashamed of their horrible customer support.,"I bought this item, used it for awhile and it worked OK. When I went to change PCs it didn't work anymore. No manual or drivers on the Logitech website because the product has been discontinued. How could they not support a product that is still on the shelves? That's the last Logitech product I'll ever buy."
1,Stopped working in 2 weeks,"The set up was easy, and the sound quality was decent. Then it just stopped working within 2 weeks. Went to the Logitech website, but was unable to find a trace that this product ever existed. It's one thing that every product have a life cycle, it's another to deny the very existence of a product. You can tell the difference if you look at Logitech's website. What a shame."
1,run away,"this product never worked very well, lots of gliches, but then it just up ang quite after about 2 months.go with this...Creative Labs Xmod Wireless Music Systemyou have been warned"
1,inhumane for dogs - makes them crazy,"I just wanted to give a heads up. My husband is a veterinarian, and says that messing with a dog with one of these literally makes them go crazy. It happened to my friend; their formerly wonderful boxer now spends the day barking at shadows and being paranoid. It's not so much an issue for cats."
1,trouble running,"This program worked fine on my computer (Win 2k pro) for about a month, and then i can't open it, i get a ""An unamed file contains an invalid path"" error message. Have done everything short of re-formatting my hard drive, which I probably won't do, easier to buy a competitor's product that will work...I've asked Jasc for support 2 months ago, and nothing has happened, and nothing posted on their web site as of 11/13/2003. Some of the batch functions that I purchased this product for got added to PSP 8. Now I see they are trying to sell PSP 8 and Photo album as a ""suite."" Go to www.jasc.com and read through the forums for this product (or any product, for that matter) before purchasing."
1,Extremely Disappointed,Product support for this software is non-existent. Purchased Photo Album 4 specifically to record slide shows with audio onto CD's. It has never worked. I have e-mailed JASC technical support numerous times over the last several weeks without a reply. Very frustrating.
1,Junk,"This software is a piece of junk. I thought it would be an improvement over Photoshop Album because of some of its additional features, but it turned out to be useless. I note that Adobe Photoshop Album has a new version now, so I'm going to order that and sail the Paint Shop Album CD into the ocean. Save your money. Don't buy it."
2,Not a happy customer,This is my first experience into digital cameras and photo software. I found the enhancing tools to be dissappointing. One of the big things I was looking forward to doing is making a CD that would be viewable on a DVD player. This did not work in any CD or DVD player I could find so I took the CD into my local Circuit City store. The sales person said that he had NO CD or DVD player in the store that could handle the VCD format that this software uses. This really made me happy! He said that the format is no longer recognized. Maybe the guy does not know what he is talking about!? Be sure your player can handle the DVD format before you raise your expectation levels or even buy this product.
1,Junk,"I have been looking for a black under the counter can-opener. My last Black and Decker lasted almost 16 years. This one did not last a week. The front cover is very sleek and keeps the blade covered - too bad it snapped off the second time I used the can-opener. I am still using this appliance because I don't want a white can opener hanging from my dark cherry cabinets, but I can't use the clock or timer, since the cover is sitting idle in a drawer. I am very disappointed since I assume the nearly $... price tag was for those two features."
2,It's not that great,"We've been trying to get the clock/timer to work for five months. It still isn't right. The can opener is awkward and sloppy. If I open a can of tomato sauce, it splashes drops of sauce on the countertop. Opening a can of chicken broth results in a tidal wave.I bought this can opener because I wanted an black undercouter opener that would match my kitchen and not clutter my counter. Next time, I'll buy a manual opener, in any color, and keep it in the drawer."
5,EC950B Black and Decker Can Opener,"Easy to install under cabinet. Everything included to mount it.Best of all, it works well on every can I have tried including very large ones. Works as well as any opener I have ever used."
3,Got what I paid for,"Well, I had this about 18 mos and it finally crapped out. It worked fine up until then, but after about a year, the display quit, and then a few months later, the actual can opening mechanism fell apart...it is made of plastic after all. Needless to say, I didn't buy another one to replace it, but I couldn't find a black under the cabinet one to replace this, so I bought a counter top model. There's lots of white under the counter models out there, but this is the only black one I could find...which is why I bought it! The wife had to have matching appliances!"
3,We'll see,"I like Black & Decker products. This one works properly, but I wish the cover was a little more secure. I'm afraid that after a few uses, the lid won't stay closed anymore."
1,"if you must have it, get it from a local store so you can return it easily","The clock broke w/in 1 weeks of hooking this under my counter. I am not impressed w/the look. This is my only regret buy from amazon, and it has nothing to do w/ amazon, the quality just isn't good."
3,Background on UFO lore,"In the same decade H.G. Wells wrote The War of the Worlds, Americans all across the States reported seeing an airship more massive and advanced than anything possible at the time.Most people believe UFOs and aliens are the inventions of the 20th century, with all its whizbang technology, from airplanes and radar to nuclear bombs and genetic engineering. This book, and a companion book The Great Texas Airship Mystery, both reveal that people have been paranoid for a good long time. :)Cohen, the author, covers various reports in newspapers from that era, and tracks the course of the airship. He includes enough clippings from newspapers to make the reports seem genuine. It is doubtful the man simply imagined this event.For students studying UFO lore and history, a complete understanding of extraterrestrial mythology should begin with the earliest history. For the casual reader who is not researching UFOs, this book is not incredibly entertaining."
1,This Computer Could be the worst ive ever had.,This Computer I had for 1 year and the hardrive crashed... took 3 months to get back from repair.. then i have had it past 4 years and is slower than my friends 2001 laptop with a 1.2GHz Processor. Dont buy it.IT BLOWS
1,not that good,i found the book jumps all over the place it doesn't give you a project to complete with the advice she is offering some properties are of some use but i find this just plain and very ordinary book that i dont use much.
2,Not for the MS Access dilettante!,"I bought this book when my boss appointed me to design a simple database to interface with legacy db systems. I had no design experience and a few weeks' of coursework nearly five years ago.Although I purchased this book based upon reviews here ..., I soon realized that this book is not for the database lightweight. This book is clearly an intermediate text. If I didn't have the preliminary background playing around with Access I could have never even gotten started with the book. I gave it a 2 only b/c I am assuming that some expert found this material enlightening. I could have gotten better mileage using it for firewood kindling."
5,Makes you life easier,"To begin with ""It is a really great book"". I have bought several books on Access 97 and 2000. Alison's book is not intended for beginners who will not like it. But If you have a prior good experience in Access 2000, and start reading this book, you will never leave it. Alison starts with you on the ABCs of VBA and goes steadly and slowly deeper and deeper, she makes you know What is SQL, DAO ...etc. The language of the book is easy to understand. If you are trying to be a developer and intend to, read this book, practice and do hard work, you will never regret it.Advice: Do not jump chapters, read a chapter after another, read each and every line. Practice the examples more than twice, and most important of all, be patient and don't rush results.This book is great and necessary for each developer to be."
1,For beginning programmers only,"I would not recommend this book if you already know how to use a programming language. If you can understand the Access help system, this book will add virtually nothing to your understanding of Access."
5,Mastering Microsoft Access 2000 development,"I have purchased just about every single Access book on the market in the pass five years. Alison Balter's Access 2000 development is the best book for client/server programming using Access 2000 as the front-end and SQL Server as the back-end.I have experience in building large multi-user applicatoins in other platforms, and was looking for a book that would show me how to do it in ACCESS 2000 and SQL Server. This is the book.Chapters 16-23 in PART III of the book are the best I've seem in any book describing concepts in designing and coding a large client/server system.The other two books I would highly recommend for ACCESS developers are ACCESS 2000 Developer's Handbook Volume 1 & 2 by Litwin, Gilbert, and Getz.The above books are not for beginning programmers but are for ACCESS developers."
5,Excellent book,"I bought this book when I started to work on an Access application and found it is very helpful. This book targets toward the intermediate to advanced developers. It provides with many pratical examples and code. We can easily port the code into our applications. The book not only covers the basic and advanced tables, forms, queries, and reports, but also covers VBA, Windows API, security, maintenance and distribution. After reading this book, I became more masterful at Access development."
4,Nice cookbook,Simple recipes with fabulous results. We got a couple of real main staple recipes from this that are good for you and easy and they are very tasty!Hope they reprint this one!
1,disappointed with this product,"I bought these bags as a cheaper substitute for the tilia foodsaver bags. I should have spent the money on the foodsaver bags! These bags are much thinner, so they don't protect food as well, and also are not as durable (and therefore reusable as many times) as the foodsaver bags are. They don't have the same built-in air channel design that the foodsaver bags have; rather, they have channel ""flaps"" trap that air in the bag, especially if they are wrinkled in any way, as they would be if you tried to re-use the bags. Therefore, you can't always vacuum all the air out, especially when the item has liquid- the liquid spills out before all the air is removed, often interfering with the seal. So I actually ended up wasting more money (and time) making new bags trying to get a proper seal. I didn't have this problem with the regular foodsaver bags. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,black&decker freshguard,"I am looking for bags to go with my BLACK&DECKER FRESHGUARD, mmmmmm going by what has been given as to scores and comments I swear my dog would have done better ordering and commenting. You were supposed to order replacements for the ITEM that you OWN. Thank You!! for the help you have given"
4,A Significant Contribution,"This book provides an excellent description of the contributions of the Canadian Forces in Somalia. I was particularly interested in the Airborne Regiment detail as my nephew, w/o Don Labossiere, participated in this deployment.The book educates the reader as to the mission, environment and challenges faced by the Force personnel. It also documents some of their accomplishments and some recognition received by these superb soldiers. I feel there could have been more detail provided about specific duties such as deep patrols,encounters with opposing forces, etc., however."
2,One small but major problem,"The device mounts easy enough so you can slide the machine under a cabinet. When it clicks into place it still ""wiggles"" a little bit, but it's not too bad.The main problem with my coffeemaker is it runs too hot. Within an hour the coffee starts tasting burnt, especially if it's down to half a pot or less. I'd consider something else."
1,Bad cup o' java,"I am a huge coffee drinker...this coffee maker has to be without a doubt the WORST maker on the market. Haven't found a brand of coffee yet that tastes decent after brewing. The maker leaks all over the counter while brewing, even when level ... Bought to match my new kitchen...LOL throwing it out and putting up the old model that works GREAT! [FLIMSY FLIMSY] plastic...lousy construction...extremely POOR quality. Forget presetting for wakeup, it brews when IT wants to or not at all, total waste of money."
3,Life Span,"We have had 3 of the space saver coffee makers and they don't last long, about 3 years and the last one was 2 years. The teflon comes off the hot plate also. My husband loves this one because of the easy filling. We are considering a different brand now after this one just quit today."
3,Poor pour,"Love everything about it except:1) Lip on glass pot too thick. Coffee runs down front of pot (yes,the handle is on straight) & all over everything. We would change black handle & cover to our old pot but can't find a tool to remove the screw B & D has used. So...we use our old pot with a gray handle & hope for help from B&D.2) Wish it had the old feature of choice for 1 or 2 hour shut-off."
2,Plastic parts break,"Plastic parts tend to break and are expensive to replace.Also, cleaning and assembling is time consuming.Great product if you need to do heavy duty work."
2,"Good looking, but underbuilt","You can't argue with its looks, but its critical parts, the splined couplers and the lid hooks are made of weak plastic. Had to replace the couplers and the lid three times in the first year.Perfectly fine for occasional use, but won't survive through usage in a real kitchen. Bummer."
1,Underwire an understatement!,Underwire an understatement! I ordered this and returned it.It fit and I like a front hook but the underwire was too much and high in the front you would expect it to end somewhere near the cleavage. Odd.
2,Wire pokes out,"I am a full-figured woman and the underwire on this bra sticks out near the closure no matter how I try to adjust the fit. I bought the bra because I was having a problem with my shoulder that makes putting on a bra with the hooks in the back very difficult. I generally don't wear underwire bras since I find them uncomfortable. On the plus side, this bra is fairly easy to put on and to snap closed and it is comfortable. On the negative side, I have to wear it under a very loose top because the underwire sticks out so far. I would not recommend this bra."
2,Small,I ordered it a size larger in width and still ran too small. I know my size from all my others. Would not recommed
5,Love this bra!!,"I owned this bra and loved it and just purchased three more! Very comfortable, supportive bra. Love the front closure."
4,Well-fiitting Bra at a Reasonable Price,"Having gained weight since my thinner, flatter-chested thirties, I now need an underwire bra. I searched for one that looked a little sexy in addition to being functional. This bra is it! It fits well, the straps are easy to adjust, the front closure isn't ""fussy"" but is easy to open and close, and the whole bra has a lacy, feminine look. Also, the bra is reasonably priced. I recommend."
1,Doesn't fit right,"I bought this for my daughter and ordered the size she normally wears. It fit bandwise -- but the cups stuck out on top. It hooks on the front bottom with one clasp -- the rest of the front closure should go straight up, it doesn't it leans forward. You could never wear this under a t-shirt. It's gone in the Goodwill pile. It fit perfectly, if not for that feature. And the front close feature was what she was looking for."
1,Front closure doesn't close,"I bought this bra because I am having problems with my arms due to herniated neck discs. So, I thought fastening in the front would be easier. I saw all the reviews about the front clasp being very difficult to use, but decided to ignore them. Frankly, I thought those women must be mechanically challenged in some way. Boy was I wrong. I sent this bra back the same day I got it. Both my husband and I tried over and over to get the clasp to work, and neither of us could do it. It became a funny challenge, but whether the bra was on or off we could not unclasp the thing. Do not buy this product."
4,Glamorise Front close Bra,"This bra was comfortable I would order one size larger around if I was to order another one. Cup size was fine. I didn't care for the lace and the darts that make you look like you have four nipples when you're wearing a tighter shirt. So if your looking for sexy this might not be the bra for you, but if your looking for comfort you found it. I loved the fact that the shoulder straps did not fall down, that was a big plus for me."
2,Wire stick bra front out,"When you put the bra on, it is low cut on the front but the wire comes up and poke the bra out. unless you are wearing on overside shirt, you will see the push out through the shirt. It might be ok if you are a small breasted woman."
5,looks great fits even better,Have worn Glamorise before and wanted to try a front close. It is easy to hook and stays hooked as needed. I like the lacy look and all over stretch. I have ordered more.
3,pretty,front close bras are wonderful! Unless you are playing a game of 'Twister'! This is one of the prettier bras in this size I have seen.
3,Wonder why wonderwire pokes out in front?,"The bra is pretty. It fits nicely EXCEPT the ""wonderwire"" at the top sticks out between my breasts and shows through my shirt!! Needs a fastener at the top of the bra cups between breasts to hold the wires together so they don't stick out. Other than that MAJOR flaw, it's a nice bra. Unfortunately, I'll be returning to sender. I shouldn't have to fix it to wear it."
2,Front Closure Bras,"I love the front closure bras, however when I wear this product there are little bumps in the cups that make me appear to have extra nipples. This is very disturbing. I would have sent them back, but I realized my husband had thrown the paper work away."
2,Dart (seam) shows through clothes,"As other reviewers mentioned, there is a dart running down the middle of the cup and it doesn't lie flat. So, it looks like your headlights are on (if you know what I mean), or worse, like you have four nipples."
3,front close bra,"the bra looks good, but the closure is to far down on the ""wire"" thus leaving a gap. I have currently an old one and that does not do it, there fore I returned it the next day.BA"
2,The underwire pokes forward & the lace is very scratchy,"Better to buy their new frontclosure bra--not this one!Drawbacks1The lace is scratchy. There should be a smooth nylon lining.2The underwire comes up over the clasp and pokes forward so its hard to get it to lay flat3The support is not as good as the average underwire back-closing bra--with a 42DD I have to have very good supportThese drawbacks seemed to get worse and worse the more it was washed until it became impossible to wear it with a close fitting garment.Positives1easy to put on and clasp -once you get the hang of it2straps dont slip off3 the underwires have never come out in year of wearing it.Overall now that Glamorise makes a MUCH better front-closing Wonderwire bra that fits smoothly for my large size (42DD), I will not buy this kind anymore even though it is less expensive."
3,"Comfortable, but . . . . .","I bought 2 of these bras and they are comfortable but . . . . they must have been designed by a man because I can't imagine a woman would put a seam right down the front to the center of the cup. Some may call this a dart. What ever it is, it doesn't complement a light weight top. It makes your nipple look like it's sticking out when in actuality it's the beginning of the seam. I'm sure that with a sweater or heavier top it won't be a problem but for the summer tops it could be embarrassing. It's hard to find a good front hook bra so I will keep these but continue my search."
5,Cute and comfortable!,I prefer front-close bras but have trouble finding one in my size that is attractive and comfortable with good support. This one has it all and at a reasonable price. I work long days and even late into the evening I am not in a hurry to get out of it. The under wire is much comfier than I had anticipated. An excellent choice!
3,really small cups,"The bra is nicely made and fairly easy to hook in front. It has a plastic hook where one side slides into the other from the top. You have to hold the two pieces together at the correct angle to get the barrel piece into the other side. The cups are really small. I am, and got, a double d, but this fit me like a C cup, so I had to return it. I was a little disappointed in the mini lining. There is about a one inch strip inside the cups, on the bottom, to add extra support, but it doesn't lay flat until it's on you. It didn't bother me once the bra was on though."
2,Always Cooking,"This bra is snug, not sloppy, but there was no nipple coverage at all, and it was terribly uncomfortable around the sides. It felt OK when I put it on, but it rolled right away, and because it's a front-closure bra, there is no way to adjust the tightness. I usually wear a 40 but bought a 42 instead, and it was still tight and the rolling really dug in. Maybe if I wash it 50 times, it might loosen up? I doubt it. I guess I'll have to lose 20 lbs. and only wear it on the weekends when nipple coverage is not so important. ;-)"
3,straps too long,"The lace is very pretty on this bra and the cup is good. The front closure is easy and works well. However after a wash and a little wear I have the straps at the max for shortening and need to shorten it a bit more, which means trying to somehow shorten it with a sewing machine. If your torso is long you would be fine, but I am 5'6"" and it is too long in the straps for me. Would return it but have worn and washed it. Wish I could of given it more stars, but simply can no longer wear it... Also had to bend the wires at the front to keep them from sticking out of my shirts...but that worked...."
3,Beautiful,"Although this bra is beautiful and is comfortable, the underwire sticks up and out in the front. I have to wear a baggy shirt when I wear this bra."
3,just ok glamorise front close bra,"have my right hand in a splint so had to get a front close bra. this was about the only one i could find that wouldn't smoosh me down like a sports bra and it was much prettier. and it is very pretty and would have been perfect except that the wires at the front above the closure stick out away from my body. i suppose it could just be me :-) but it's looks kinda weird under a top... it's perfect weight, unlined and very supportive, but i wouldn't buy another one because of that wire issue. it did arrive super fast though"
1,waste of money,"This bra was a waste of money. The latch in the front sticks out through your clothing. I haven't found anything that can be worn with this, Would not reccommend to anyone"
1,Underwire disaster,"The underwires in the center front, just above the clasp, protrude & show through the outer clothing. Maybe I just don't have the body type for this particular style, but it sure didn't work for me."
3,didn't work for me,"I purchased this bra, very nice but it clasps on the wrong side after having a stroke I need the male side of the clasp on the right. I had to return it because I couldn't clasp it, with the ability to use only one hand. I have other front closures that work for me."
3,o.k. overall,"Overall, the bra is ok. Material is a bit stiff, a bit scratchy on the skin. Bra seems to fit a ""tad"" on the smaller size, not a huge difference, just a ""tad"". Could just be me, as everyone is different."
3,Wire unconfortable,"The bra is very sexy and pretty, however, the wire is very unconfortable. Does Glamorise make the same bra without the wire? If so, I would buy more of this bra."
1,arrrggghhh the wire...,"The underwire in this bra was so messed up... I can't even tell you what was wrong with it, but I can tell you what it did... it stuck out from my chest, so when I had a top on it looked like something was poking out from between my breasts... not a good look you can imagine. And what a disappointment. It is difficult to find a snap in the front underwire for big breasts. Well don't bother with this one. It was a waste of money as this went to the trash can."
2,Pokey wire,After a couple wears this bra shifts and the wire starts to poke in the middle.... Really uncomfortable. I only got about 5 wears out of this....
1,Don't buy from Beauty Collection!,"My husband ordered this brush for me. The outside of the boxes states Extra Small Boar Bristle but inside is a large nylon bristle.When we called Beauty Collection they stated IT CAN""T BE RETURNED!!!!It is a personal product... so we lost $195 plus shipping.If you want this brush go elsewhere."
2,Don't bother with this one,"I saw this in a film festival last year, and just wanted to add my two cents.Others have said everything that needs to be said about the homage to/ripping off of Run Lola Run, so I won't go there.I found the characters to all be dull or annoying (except the punk girl with the dog!), the story too simplistic, and frankly I was disappointed at the writer's bad attitude towards sex toys (making it seem like a personality flaw to use them..?)Don't waste your money on this film."
2,Decent.,"This was a decent movie. It was very repetitive, which I guess was the purpose, but it didn't work out very well. The same scene replays over and over again, with only slight differences. The ending of the movie was rather disappointing as well. I considered giving this movie three stars but decided that, if I'm going to be completely honest, I'd have to give it two stars. Sure, there are a few parts I did like. But those few parts did not at all make up for the rather terrible movie."
1,Pointless,"This was ridiculous. I didn't find the ""nods"" to Run Lola Run (a movie I enjoyed) entertaining. Basically, they directly ripped off the formula. Run Lola Run has an intensity to it as Lola is on a time limit to save her boyfriends life. Lesbian Lola on the other hand is trying to get a job... This movie would have fared better with me if it wasn't ripping the formula aprt from a good movie. Whats next - lesbian versions of Das Experiment and The Princess and the Warrior? I can already see the titles now, Das Sexperiment and The Princess and The Princess."
1,Waste of celluloid!,"Has the bar been set so low for lesbian cinema that movie watchers would actually review this movie with high marks? Apparently, the answer to that question is yes. The script and acting are so bad, I had to actually stop it at times and cleanse my palette while watching the Discovery Channel. Out of respect for gay cinema, I watched the whole movie. That's over an hour of my life that I will never get back. The acting wasn't even as good as an NYU student film and the places left in the script for a bit of improv ended up being stilted and awkward because the actors were terrible. The overt and awkward sexual references throughout the film became hard to watch. They were inappropriate at times and at others just plain stupid. Ugh. I hope there are better projects in store for the writers/director/actors of this film because this one is forgettable."
2,"Had potential, but it was lost in the run","The plot? Lesbian A has to rush a set of portfolio photos into the waiting hands of girlfriend Lesbian B. On the way there she runs around San Francisco, encounters various obstacles, does some soul searching, and gets to repeat the same journey in three different versions. Because it's about lesbian characters set in North America, sitting in front of a psychotherapist at some point is inevitable. What is absolutely amazing about this film, however, is that a movie about lesbians with San Francisco as the location has not one, single dyke in it -- not even in the background of the lesbian bar where Lesbian B hangs out for most of its 71 minutes. In Trendy Lesbian Planet, the main characters can pass for straight (in comfortable shoes, of course), have fashionably slender figures, and dildos are never too far from reach. But not even the occasional (ho-hum) sex in this film could keep me from picking up the newspaper to finish reading it."
1,I advise you to skip this,"There aren't many LGBT movies/television shows out there, so when I found ""And Then Came Lola,"" I thought I'd give it a try. The whole thing felt childish, and that is before considering the random cartoon animations they throw in throughout the movie. Though it was an indie flick and I didn't have high expectations, I was still disappointed. The acting felt phony, the chemistry was off, and the story was ridiculous. Lola keeps waking up from nightmares that her girlfriend finally dumped her because she was late to an important meeting (Lola is ALWAYS late for things). Every time she wakes up, she gets a do-over to try and make it on time, however, some zany plot ensues and she is too late. It felt repetitive and I felt silly watching it. I'd have to say skip this one...sorry."
1,And then Came Lola,This movie was so flaky that I couldn't even focus on it. It was all over the place and too silly to even be considered a viable movie. A waist of money.
2,Not what I,This should have been named A Day in the Life of A Rude and Inconsiderate Lesbian. I mean that's really what the movie was about. Didn't even finish watching it. Just didn't hold my interest.
3,"Pretty ladies, kind of silly story, but fun.","A bit of a departure from story lines that I have run across. ok acting. My favorite parts included mainly the tall, dark haired woman, sort of aggressively sensuous. But that is only because that type woman really floats my boat."
2,"Bad acting, cheesy story line...","Not all the acting is bad in this movie, but the story line is pretty cheesy.At first I thought adding cartoon scenes to the movie was funny and creative but thenit just got ridiculous; especially during the dog attack and and trolly scenes.Watch if you can for free, but I wouldn't pay for it. :("
1,hmmmm,"can i get back the time i wasted watching this, really it wasn't up to much, there is good lesbian films out there go watch them!!!"
2,don't bother with this one,"Run Lola Run came out in 1999, had nothing to do with lesbians or even sex, was made in Germany, had Franka Potente in it! and was actually fun to watch. Why would they even think to remake it into this trash? Not everything needs to be translated.Don't bother with this. Watch the original movie. Great sound track keeps it moving, although the plot on that one does fine all by itself, too. It had nothing to do with love. It had to do with someone's life, hanging in the balance. And it worked."
1,lame,horrible acting and story line wouldnt suggest it to anyone it kept on playing the same scene of her running.
2,"Repetitious, repetitious, etc.","I liked the first part of the movie. I thought it was funny and clever. When the first part was repeated, with variations, I was a little disappointed. When it was repeated a third time, I got bored. I kept thinking, is this all there is?I loved the clips of the women talking to the therapist. Pretty realistic.I gave the film two stars because Ashleigh Sumner did a great job of playing Lola. She was the only one who didn't seem to be acting. Ashleigh has a cute smile, and good thing she can run."
1,Terrible storyline,"This film could have been very good. Good actresses, set etc but what a boring storyline. After watching quality lesbian films this was very disappointing. Bring back to L word!"
1,Why was this film made?,"Terrible acting, terrible plot, terrible movie. I do not know what the purpose of that move was. Perhaps to show minor nudity, or to sell it from the DVD cover. Move on. There are many other excellent movies to watch instead."
5,Superb binoculars - Stunning image quality - Built like a tank,"Last summer while visiting a friend in Germany I had a chance to try a pair of high-end Steiner binoculars. They completely reset my expectations of how good a binocular can be; the image quality was unbelievable. Unfortunately, they were the Commander series, which are way beyond my budget.I'm so glad I discovered the Marine line of Steiner! They totally blow away anything else in the price range.PROS -* Incredibly bright and sharp image* Made in Germany* Very high quality construction* Comfortable to hold* Good eye clearance* Nice carrying case included* WaterproofCONS -* Heavy - over two pounds (doesn't bother me at all, but for some it might be a factor)* Pretty large* The neck strap is a little underwhelming, but it's functionalSteiner binoculars reinforce a view I've held for years: the Germans really know how to make lenses.Don't even think about other brands if you're planning to spend $300 on binoculars. Get the Steiner!"
3,Disappointing - in light of the raving reviews,"I returned the item for a refund.Image distortion is quite prominent near the edge of the field of view. The focus in the center area (the middle 1/3 of the diameter) seems different from the focus in the outer area. The construction is sturdy, but the craftsmanship seems wanting. There are jagged edges in the plastic casing.For its price, Steiner Marine is not a bad performer. But I don't consider it an outstanding value."
5,These Binoculars are unbelievable!,"'These Binoculars are unbelievable, Way Clear, gather light at night, Rugged and easy to grab and hang onto, They are quick to get your eyes on, and at night is where these babies shine. It is not uncommon for us to go air born while cutting across the back bays of the Texas coast. There is nothing immune from getting bounced & beat. Binoculars have had a short live span while in my possession in the past. I have been around a few Military type Binoculars in the past, and have a little background on the subject. Spent six years in the infantry, transferred out of the Army and went into the Navy SeaBees, to finish my 21.My Brother-in-law is a Striper guide on Lake Texoma, He uses Nikon,He could not believe the lesser price and the far better quality.""I am 100% Satisfied with the Steiner 7x50 Marine Binoculars """
2,Very disappointed................,"Very good build quality but the quality of the optics is terrible. I realize that this is one of Steiners' entry level models but thisis no excuse for optics of such poor quality. The the outer two thirds of the image is a blurry ring. The binocular also hasvery bad astigmatism. I have a pair Nikons that cost half of what these do and they blow the Steniers away. If you wantEuropean quality performance and don't want to pay thousands, take my advice and check out Fujinon binoculars. I havea pair of Fujinon Polaris FMT 7X50's. Amazing performance for the money."
3,this is just okay...,"This is better than just buying tarot magic, it includes tarot magic and 3 other packages, but the information is quite basic and general, I was disappointed. It's interesting and could be fun I guess. I gave it three stars because of how much you get for the price..."
2,not too durable,I got this fan and install in my system since 08/2002. Everything works fine and the noise level is good. 4 months later. It began to make funny noises and it getting worst. So I have to replace it. I won't recommend this.
1,Not worth the trouble,"After trying to use this can opener for a year, I've finally given up and decided to write a review panning it... why should anyone else have to go through using one of these when it's clearly not worth the trouble. It falls apart whenever I try to set it up to open a can, and if there's the slightest irregularity in the can's edge, this can opener can't deal with it. Also, it takes extra effort to properly align it for recharging. I can't even guess how many times I've put this can opener down in disgust and reached for my good old-fashioned manual can opener! Save yourself the time, money and aggrivation by avoiding the Black and Decker KEC600 Cordless Can Opener."
4,"Handy, convenient but a little weak.","This is a nice little cordless can opener that tucks away in very little space in it's charger. The first couple of uses take some getting used to. It takes some practice to place it on the can properly but once you get the hang of it, it's actually fun to use. It will tackle any normal can with no problem and it really does stop on the first pass around. The only disappointment is that it will not open a 2 1/2 pound coffee can. It just doesn't have the power and I think the rim of this size can is too thick. Thus, the 4 stars."
1,piece of garbage,"Oh yes it worked great for about 3 months. Now it won't open anything. its fully charged and runs fine with no cans. but latch it on to a can and it does nothing. Waste of money-don't get this can opener, tons of others out there."
5,Very pleased,"After struggling with and under-cabinet opener this one is a delight! I still have to 'work' occasionally to get the blade and can in correct position but when I do it just cuts beautifully , even larger cans.MABlack & Decker KEC600 Cordless Can Opener, White"
1,disappointed,"Seemed to struggle going around the can, at times actually stalling. Could be that the batteries would not take a full charge.It was also very difficult to get started. At times it took multiple tries."
1,Shame on Black and Decker,I have a house full of Black and Decker appliances and power tools. This product is very attractive and ergonomic in its design. That is where B&D's reputation ends. The can opener must be placed a certain way in the base or it will not charge. It will not open a large can as the battery goes dead 3\4 of the way around the lid. The cutter falls off when you raise the handle to remove the opener from the can. I have never been disappointed in a B&D product before. This one is very poor. Shame on B&D for allowing an appliance of this poor quality to wear its proud name.
5,excellent!,"I purchased this can opener to replace the exact model that my wife purchased over 7 years ago that finally wore out,(the little plastic do-hicky on the cutter part broke) it got a lot of use. My wife insisted on getting the same model because she liked it so much. As for myself i wish it had an opener for beer cans as well."
4,Nice,"It works well. B & D's Gizmo had a charger that didn't look like it went to the product, and consequently got lost. This one matches, and it won't get lost. Aside from that, it works, and it doesn't clutter like the stand-up versions."
4,B&D cordless canopener,"I already had this product for about 5 years and love the way it works. It is so easy to use and can be used handless on large cans. I find it is easy to use even with arthritis hands. The battery was not holding a charge in order to open larger cans and to buy the battery,if you could find one, it was almost as much as buying a new product. The only down fall I can fine with this can opener is that you can not find the battery. That is why I rated it a 4."
5,Works Great!,"I needed an electric can opener because the arthritis in my hands has made it difficult to use a manual can opener and I didn't want another big appliance cluttering my counter top. This can opener has a small footprint. It is cordless and sits in a charging base. Perfect. It cleanly removes the lid, and catches it with a magnetic arm, unlike my manual which always left the lid hanging by a little bit of the metal. Easy to use and nice looking."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"I bought this can opener less than a year ago here on Amazon.com, and it's already stopped working. That's after light use. I couldn't believe it! It was handy while it worked, but this is ridiculous. I am extremely disappointed with this can opener. It's not worth two cents."
2,great concept... if you never plan to get it dirty.,"this is a very handy tool... at first. wait until it starts accumulating a film of dirt, and try to clean it- you'll start noticing a decline in performance. suddenly, you're checking it to make sure it's sitting in there perfectly, because you go to use it and it's dead. eventually, you'll tire of this and decide to open it to replace the batteries, and find they've corroded. who makes kitchen gadgets that aren't able to withstand a good cleaning? i found an under-the-counter model opens those awkward cans better and doesn't require the babying that this garbage does."
3,Great if you're right handed,"I had a stroke that affected my right side so I mainly use my left. I bought the one they have at Walmart that looks slightly different than this one but is the same thing just a different handle. It worked yes, but took me forever to get on the can right without the can sliding around. Need one that will work for right or left handers."
2,pd,I have this can opener. I didn't buy it from Amazon. The can opener works great for my husband (right handed) but for me I fight it all the time. I am left handed and I think that might be why. If I use my right hand I have hardly any trouble. It's hard for me to use my right hand thou.There are times if my husband is not home I say forget it I didn't want to eat what is in the can that bad. It's just really hard for me to use.
5,Best Gadget Ever,"I bought one of these for our RV because it was so small and easy to carry. I fell in love with it, and have since bought one for our home, one for my mother, one for each of my daughters. I can't say enough about how easy to use this product is. It fits on every can I've tried it on and it doesn't hesitate to just open the can and stay in place, leaving my hands free. No more sore fingers from trying to grip a manual opener and no more trying to fit awkward sizes of cans into an electric opener."
1,Good idea -- poorly implemented,"Black and Decker has a long history, at least with me, of innovative product design that is poorly implemented. This item is yet another example. A cordless can opener that actually worked would be useful. This one doesn't. It's difficult to align properly in the charging unit, made worse by the fact that there's no light to indicate if the opener is charging. The result is that without great care, the batteries don't get recharged. Even when fully charged, the opener lacks power. As others have noted, it's difficult to fit on many cans and the cutting blade portion of the opener falls off very easily. Considering the significant shortcomings of this item, along with its high price compared to traditional electric can openers, I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Very Dissapointed and Frustrated,"After having to take my daughter to the ER when she cut her finger trying to open a can with one of the three horrible can openers in the house, I went out and bought this one.When I first brought it home it worked great (what a relief). I loved it, the kids loved it and it was easy to use.Less than three months later it does not work.What does it take to get a durable, working electric can opener????"
2,Not the Best,"I owned this thing for less than a year when it stopped charging. Next time I'll stick to the Krups, which is a great can opener."
2,Not such a great experience.,"I found this can opener difficult to learn how to use. Shortly after I got the hang of it, it broke."
1,Extremely Poor Design,"I'm not sure if Black & Decker ever tested this Can Opener because it doesn't work. The blade is spring loaded and 1/2 the time it will not puncture the can, regardless of the type of can. We previously had a under-cabinet Black & Decker and it worked just fine and that's what we are going back to."
4,Great can opener,I have always liked the freedom that this type of can opener provides. This is a good one. It opens several cans before needing recharged. It is a little hard to align it in order to set it back down in the charger however. The flexibility and the ability of the can opener itself outweighs that small minus though. I highly recommend this product.
4,Not dissapointed,"As I based my decision on the reviews of others I'm happy to say they were right. I need to get used to hooking it on and it's really not hard to do so, just for me. After that it just cuts very precise. Loving it."
5,funny,love this can opener & having good laughs every time we use it. It does what it says no wonder everyone has no cans on the shelf they are too busy opening them with this can opener best I've ever seen
2,Not the greatest,"I have this can opener and it is a real disappointment. It doesn't pierce the cans reliably and often stops halfway around. It works, most of the time, but it's terribly annoying. And it's even difficult to get it straight in the base so it will recharge--plus the base is very light weight so it tips over. I had a different model of walk-around-the-can opener from GE (which became Black and Decker) before--it wore out eventually--which worked a whole lot better. I don't open a lot of cans, but when you need a can opener it should work. It's not brain surgery."
4,Works for me,"Had this - got broken - couldn't find it in the local stores so replaced with what was available, hated them - found it online - ordered it - happy again."
3,Works great - when it works.,"The first one I owned broke within six months, however it worked so well I decided to try another one. A bit hard to get started but once it's cutting it works great."
5,Perfect Kitchen Accessory,"I wish I would have seen this along time ago. Charges fast and works great. Just throw it back in the drawer when you are done, saves so much space compared to the counter can opener. Couldn't beat the price"
1,Battery Replacement is ridiculous!,"We received this can opener as a gift and liked its size and portability. After 18 months of use, the NiCad battery died and the can opener would not hold a charge any more. I tried to replace the battery but could not by it locally. When I called Black and Decker they told me the replacement battery would be $24.95! That's more than was paid for the new can opener.Seems like an electric cordless can opener should last more than one and a half year and that the battery replacement should be a little more reasonably priced. BTW, we also left the unit on the charging base when not in use, so the battery does not have a long life with even infrequent use. Looks like I'll go back to the old plug-in variety!"
5,Good Product,"I am very pleased with this can opener. It takes a little practice to get the hang of it, but once you do it's easy to use.It holds a charge for a long time and is super-lightweight.It will move easily around larger cans and does not leave marks all over the counters from spinning the cans around the opener.I recommend the Black & Decker KEC600 Cordless Can"
2,Disappointed,I am now on my third of these can-openers. I am trying to resist buying another. All three of mine have had the same problem. The cutter/lid holder piece has cracked on all three. The last one lasted longer than the others at 2 years but I really don't feel you should have to replace a can-opener every 1-2 years. I had no trouble at all with anything else about the opener.Guess I'll try the Krups someone suggested.
4,It actually works!,"i was a little doubtful of this can opener after reading reviews of similar styles, but it actually works. just start it and let go and the can is open. i only give it 4 stars because i have trouble getting the opener to attach to very small cans like tiny cans of vegetables."
1,Terrible power supply,"Like some of the other reviews, we had problems with it losing power in the first few weeks. It has gotten steadily worse and after a couple months will barely open one can before it dies."
2,Not satisfied at all,"I previously owned a Black and Decker cordless can opener and loved it. After a number of years the battery wouldn't hold a charge so I ordered this as a replacement. I have had it less than a year and the plastic near the blade has broken off so it will not hold on to a can. I also found it difficult to get back into the charger so that it charged, so many times I would go to use it and it was dead. I need to buy a new cordless can opener, but surely will not buy another Black and Decker."
4,Saves time and is fun to watch,"One of the kitchen chores I really hate to do is to open cans with a manual can opener. The Black and Decker KEC600 solves this problem and makes you want to open *more* cans. The unit clips on to the lip of your can and just walks all the way around it. It handles all can sizes well and even the small sardine cans too. The trick is to hold on to the opener and let the can move around while it is being opened.The cutting part of the opener is detachable, and a quick rinse under running water cleans the blade. The B&W; can opener recharges in a color matching base but sometimes is hard to insert. If you drop it in at the wrong angle, the can opener will not charge. A little thing, but still...A good piece of kitchen magic..."
4,Excellent Product!,This product by black and decker is by far the best can opener I've ever used. So convenient and very user friendly. I got this product for my mom for Christmas and she can't stop ranting and raving about it. I would suggest this product to anyone.
4,Easy to use,"We had this product before but after about six years it finally stopped working. Unfortunately, since we had moved during this period we could not locate the original manual showing the battery replacment, so we purchased a standard upright can opener.The standing can opener was not working for us and we had not found a suitable replacement until I did a search on Amazon. This unit is easy to use, opens different size cans and is very nice to be able to take the opener to where you need it."
5,Great product!!,This model is perfect fit for the hands (especially if you are limited by arthritis). Easy to grip and handle. It only takes up a small amount of space. I keep it in my spice cabinet with the plug running out the side of the door (by the hinges). This is my second one. The first one I had for 10 years before it stopped working. Worth the cost.
1,Garbage Battery,"This thing will last a little under a year with daily use, eventually it will fail to charge (even if you keep both charging contacts perfectly clean)."
1,Good for awhile--but no reliability,"This was a terrific gadget--for a few months. It then died. While it seems to be charging OK (limitation: there's no charge light on the base, so you just hope for a positive mechanical connection), there just isn't enough oomph to get around even one can, at least most of the time, without major coaxing. The backup: open a drawer and use the old manual model. That appears the only reliable ""cordless"" device available.Black & Decker's quality on small appliances seems to have really gone down the tubes over the last few years. I'm replacing this with a corded model from West Bend; B&D; will never again darken my kitchen."
1,Battery doesn't last long - would not buy again,"This product is OK when it works but I bought mine in October 2005, open a few cans a week and store it on the charger constantly and the unit is dead in less than one year. I will go back to a bigger unit with a cord and I will be much happier."
5,Great Gift!!,"Gave this to my mother-in-law for Christmas. She swears it's the best thing since sliced bread (no, really, she does). She reports ""it's the fastest and easiest opener I've ever used!!."""
2,Old one was better,I purchased this opener because 6-7 yrs ago I had bought the same thing...what I have noticed with this one is that they look the same but I noticed right away that it was lighter in weight. It does not hold a charge either. I was able to charge my old one up and I wouldn't have to recharge it for a couple of months. I also have trouble using it on large cans...I would not recommend this opener.
2,Cordless Can Opener with short lifespan,"My wife and I were happy with the idea of a cordless can opener. Initially the can opener worked fine for me. My wife had difficulty mounting the can opener correctly on the can and would have to resort to the old style hand model out of frustration on several occasions. This can opener is not ""wife friendly."" I would not recomend buying this can opener for your wife.After a few months the unit began to run slower and slower. It finally died and would no longer accept a charge even after cleaning the charging contacts.Pros: Cordless convenience. Sharp blade opens cans easily when unit is fully charged and working. Attractive design.Cons: Is not well balanced. Can opener needs to be held in hand when opening 15oz cans and smaller. Uses outdated NiCad battery technology. Should have idiot light that monitors charging."
2,A product that needs to be rolled back to the earlier model,"Th earlier model (KEC300) is what I wanted to replace since I couldn't find a rechargeable battery for it. But this KEC600 model does not work on small size cans (smaller than 3"" dia). At least I couldn't get it to open one even after 45 minutes of messing around with it. And I had about 6 years of experience using a B&W; cordless can opener before. Most of the cans we have are coconut milk cans that measure around 2.8"" dia.A very ill-conceived design I would say. Why didn't they stick with the earlier model instead of trying to fix something that's not broke ???"
5,Best ever,"This is a great can opener. Takes very little counter space, easy to use, can hold it over sink so cans don't splash on counter top. I have one, bought one for my sister for Christmas, and now we're buying two more for my nieces."
5,Best Can Opener Ever,"This little opener is wonderful. I've had it over 2 yrs. Takes very little counter space, super easy to use, no spilled cans, never the wrong size, etc. And it's so easy even for my arthritic hands.It takes a little getting used to, and learning how to position it. I don't have much patience and I got pretty frustrated. Now I'm used to it and it's just great. I would recommend this to anyone and in fact just got one for my sister for Christmas. And my husband really likes it too, so not just a female gadget."
1,a piece of junk,"I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE I HAVE A STROKE AND CAN ONLY USE ONE HAND. I READ THE OWNERS MANUAL, AND ATTEMPTED TO USE THIS CAN OPENER 5 DIFFERENT TIMES. IT WILL NOT OPEN CANS FOR ME. MY WIFE TRIED IT WITH TWO HANDS, AND HAD THE SAME RESULT. VERY MISLEADING. PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK ONE-HANDED, OR TWO."
4,convenient can opener,"This is the best can opener I could find. I had one for about 10 years by Black and Decker with a wall mounted charger/storage place. I tried to get another after it was worn out, but this is the closest I could find. I like it, but it has to sit on the counter and take up precious space. It is almost the same as the original, can go anywhere you need to open cans and it can be hands-free."
5,Best can opener ever!,"This is the best electric canopener I have ever owned. It took me a few tries to learn where to place the blade for it to work, but now that I know to lay the two white tabs on top of the can edge, it works on the first try every time! It is very quiet, takes up very little space on my countertop, and is always charged and ready to use. I did my research and trusted the reviews and am very happy with it. It was also worth the wait to get the white/gray color that I wanted."
5,Convenient and Easy to Use!,"This is our second version of the Black and Decker can opener. Our old one finally started to burn out after 5 years. This version is even easier to use and looks much nicer. The best part about it is that, it takes up very little counter space."
5,Love it,"This is my favorite can opener of all time. It works wonderfully. I got one for my wedding 8 years ago and the battery was starting to weaken a bit, so I bought another one for when it completely goes out. The only problem I had with the first one was the magnet came out somewhere. I would totally recommend this can opener to anyone"
3,Not a bad gadget,"Product arrived quickly and in new condition. It is somewhat difficult to attach it to the can top or maybe i have two left hands,but I don't think it attaches as easily as their compeditor. I hope it is more durable than the little one you put AA batteries in. Once locked on to the can it proceeds to plod around the lid until it shuts its self off. It does seem to struggle a bit on some type of cans, like it doesn't have enough power. But ultimately, it gets the job done."
5,Black & Decker cordless can opener,"I first got one of these about 7 years ago as a gift and LOVED it. When the battery on the original one played out, I began a search to find one just like it. Simply put, once you have used a can opener such as this, another won't do. I could not find one of these at any of our neighborhool retail outlets, but was happy to find it at Amazon.com. We used our manual opener until the replacement cordless opener arrived. This can opener takes up very little counter space, looks good and is very easily cleaned---terrific item!!"
1,difficult to use,It is very difficult to properly position this can opener to properly open cans. It often takes me five or six tries before the can will open. It is very frustrating. It is also difficult to place the opener back on the charger correctly.
3,Can Opener is OK,"I like this can opener once you get it started, but like others, I find it VERY hard to get the blade to line up with the can lid. It seems to take me forever to get it lined up and to punchure the can, once done though, it works fine, even on the larger coffee cans. I don't have any trouble getting it to sit in the charger like some reviewers have noted."
1,WQRNING= DO NOT ORDER THIS !!!,"THIS CAN OPENER SHOULD NOT BE CALLED THAT, IT SHOULD BE CALLED A KITCHEN DECORATING ITEM, BECAUSE THAT IS ALL IT CAN DO !!IT WILL NOT EVEN CLIP ONTO THE CAN !!I CAN'T GET IT IT TO WORK, AND I'M YOUN G AND STRONG..WHAT A WASTE, IF I SEND IT BACK, I'LL BE OUT MORE MONEY !!!!UGH...BEWARE !!"
1,My favorite roller! Better than foam.,"This little think is amazing, and is perfect for a suitcase. I keep it on the mantle and it is decorative. Most body equipment is ugly."
2,Disappointed at the cover,"I was very disappointed in the cover that was chosen for this book. I was embarrassed to read it in view of my family or friends. I had just told some fellow readers about Copeland's spiritual awakening and then they see a cover like this. Poor judgement on the publishers part, especially when the content was good."
2,NOT AS PICTURED,"MY COMPANY BOUGHT THIS CHAIR FOR ME IN BURGUNDY AS A PRIZE. WHEN IT CAME IT WAS NOT THE CHAIR PICTURED AND IT WAS BLACK. THE SCREWS IN THE SEAT ARE PUSHING THRU THE CUSHION, MAKING THE SEAT RATHER UNCOMFORTABLE. I'M AFRAID THEY'LL EVENTUALLY PUSH THRU THE MATERIAL ON THE TOP OF THE CUSHION. I WOULDN'T BUY FROM THE GREEN GROUP AGAIN."
4,as expected & gets the job done,"Price? Great. Build quality? Great, it is not cheap feeling. Fits the other reviews? Pretty much. Would buy again? Definitely as I only need low volume. Unjams easily? YES! Ok, well that it does jam is a bummer, but only 1 or 2 over hundreds of brads. I would definitely recommend for anyone needing low volume use and wants to save their money.The only CON: Sometimes it shoots 2 brads. That may not even be the nailer per se. Maybe I am triggering wrong. Maybe it is just my unit and not all. While a bit annoying, I would still get it again."
5,Impressed,"First time user of an air gun. Decided to obtain one to expedite rebuild project. Very surprised how efficient and easy to use the Wen 61720 turned out to be. No problems, no jams and saved me many hours.If this is a sample of what a air gun can accomplish I will never tote another hammer. Thank you Wen and Amazon. Packaging, price and delivery time excellent."
5,Can't Go Wrong,"For $40 bucks, I don't think its going to get any better than this. It does what its supposed to do and does it relatively well. I have had a few misfires and one time it shot out two nails at once but hey for the price I can certainly live with that."
4,so far-so good,"I have used this nailer for about 2 months now, and it hasn't missed a lick--no jams using 5/8 and 1 1/4 brads. Good gun for the price and will use WEN again as the need arises."
2,Way to many errors,"This book has an excellent choice of topics, use of figures, and numerous well presented examples. It would be an excellent book, except it has so many errors it is almost useless. I am working though the early chapters and examples as a refresher, since I am familiar already with this material, and have found errors in almost every section. Often the errors are subtle, an exponent missing here or an incorrect integration bound there, including in key equations, making them very difficult to find if you don't already know the material and are willing to work through it in detail. I have completely lost confidence in the book. When I go to later chapters, which are new material to me, I never know if my misunderstanding is the result of my missing something or Ludeman's unbelievably sloppy production. Hopefully he will come out with a second edition, and actually bother to proofread it."
2,disappointed,A little disappointed with this book. I was expecting (hoping) for a little more insight on the foundaries themselves and a little less on process.
5,This is a much needed resource!,As an ADD Coach and somebody who is very active in the online ADD Community I am aware that partners and spouses of people with ADD need support. Resources that are specfically for Partners of People with Attention Deficit Disorder are far and few between. This book is one of a kind and offers much needed tips and strategies for partners of people with Attention Deficit Disorder.
4,SEAL AWAY,I HAVE NO REVIEW BUT A QUESTION CAN SOMEONE TELL ME WHERE OR HOW TO ORDER OR GET REPLACEMENT BAGS THANK YOU
3,BS200 sealer,"The sealer portion of system works pretty well, no problem sealing bags. The vacuum part of the system does not work very well at all. System does not have the horsepower to remove the air from the bags at all."
1,"Save your money, to buy something better.","I bought mine over the internet, and just tried it out. There is definitely not enough suction power, and after a few minutes air was back in the bag. This is absolutely useless! I wonder, really, why companies bother to produce something that simply does not work. You get what you pay for alright. If you must save longer to buy a better brand, it will certainly be worth it. Otherwise, good quality ziplock bags and a rolling pin are much cheaper."
2,there clothes!!,Okay when i saw this on t.v i liked it a lot i love gang movies...then as year's go by i couldn't rmb the name of this moive and i saw kill bill and it remind me about this movie well patch at lease because of the one eye and how 2nd in command they where. but anyways i looked it up on youtube and i was happy that i rmb the name of this couldnt wait i had to come to amazon to buy it and then later i found out i could watch this movie on netflix and with i did. as am watching it they had the same clothess on threw out the whole movie i never saw that until now lol but it still good am still getting this moive.
4,Awesomely Bad!,"This movie is great, horrible acting, super-low budget, very over-the-top. It's no West Side Story, but definately hilarious after a couple of drinks. Truly Le Bad Cinema!"
1,Better Rent this one,"Falls short on the Raunch ""B"" movie fans have grown to love. I purchased this movie, because it was not at my local video store, I wish it had been. Some of the worst acting I have ever seen."
4,a perfect flick for the b-movie fan.,"Robbie lee gives a perfect depiction of a troubled teen on the edge, showing a feminine side to her ghetto land up bringing. Not to mention her co-star (maggie) in that hot little mini skirt."
1,junk,We got this for our 2 year old son for Christmas as a stocking stuffer. It broke the very first time he used it in the bath tub! It was a fun toy to play with while it lasted.
1,It ain't a Porsche!,"Having a coffeemaker distributed by a German maker of auto parts and dishwashers named for a sports car is a stretch.Better to look for function over form than to buy this overpriced ""designer"" coffeemaker. Does it brew a cup of coffee worthy of the Porsche brand? NO!"
3,"Beautiful design, BUT no timer!","How did Bosch overlook the necessity of having a timer and a clock display on their slick designed coffee maker? I have purchased mine a few weeks ago for almost $$$ and now the price dropped to $$$ so I'm sending it back just to rebuy it. If Amazon can cut the price in half just like that, it proves this product isn't worth the $$$ I spent. But I'm a snob who wanted the name of a very reputable German maker who, by the way, makes the most durable products on the market, such as washers, dryers and their famous vacuums. Overall, great item to show off in your modern contemporary kitchen."
3,"Slick looking, cool but WAY overpriced","I bought one of these for my sister in South Africa as a wedding gift - it cost at the time about $... (2 years ago). I looked for a long time whether it would be available in the US. I'd pay even $... for it, but $... is ridiculous -- not worth it."
2,There are better (style) choices.,"Searching for a stylish coffeemaker. After reading customer reviews on this Bosch coffeemaker, I pass on this one & purchase the one designed by Jasper Morrison. Rowenta CT8002KA."
1,Save the money and the grief,"Yep, its a handsome thing. But leaks. You'd expect good service on such an expensive coffee pot. Wrong. To fix the leak, I looked on Bosch's site for a service center. It gave me the name of a local center. After waiting two weeks for parts, the service center told be to call Bosch direct. I did. They then said it was the wrong type of service center and that I should pick up the coffee pot and send it to a distant repair center. Wow. And it makes so-so coffee. Don't get hyped."
4,Who said a coffee maker couldn't be sexy?,"No self-respecting stainless-steel kitchen should be without it. Canister easily comes off to fill with water at the tap. We've been through at least 15 coffee makers over the years, and this one has been with us for 3 years now (a record no doubt).Only complaint is that I wish the carafe somehow snapped in, or had an optional latch as to ensure one doesnt snag the handle when passing by or wiping down the counter top around the unit and knock it off its shallow base (and perhaps onto the floor as is in my case, a possible risk when planting your unit on a busy kitchen island)."
2,Good marketing; Poor delivery,"I am very disappointed in this machine. I saw it on the Today Show and then purchased it from Amazon. I have had it about a month now and here's what's wrong: 1) metallic taste with each pot of coffee- now you'd think that this wouldn't happen with a high end machine, but no matter what I've tried it is still there-the literature that comes witht the machine mentions this may happen, but their cure doesn't work; 2) it leaks- although there is a water level indicator on the filling tank, go a little over and you have coffee all over the counter; you have thought that it would stay in the basket instead of running out over the counter; 3) coffee remains hot/warm maybe 3hrs tops even if you preheat thermal carafe with hot water; and 4) how could you forget to design a timer into the coffee pot- especially at this price--I'm going back to my Mr Coffee machine!"
4,Great coffee,"Crushing is better than whipping, and at a better price than the Braun coffee burr. For years I had used one of those grinders that whipped the beans around and seldom getting an even grind. Given the same conditions, I immediately noticed the improved taste using a coffee burr, especially when making espresso. My only complaint is that some grind escapes from the container during the grinding process, probably due to static. This was an infinitesimal tradeoff for a much improved cup of coffee."
1,B&D Grinder Started Breaking at 2 months!,"We received the B&D coffee grinder in November. Great grounds and great coffee. HOWEVER...there are plastic parts that help hold the bean dispenser in place, and after 2 months they began breaking! When broken, the plastic piece joined the bins in the grinder and made a terrible racket, but didn't make it into the grounds. The motor got hot a few times. The 3rd and final fin broke about 3 weeks ago. The grinder works fine now (with the usual mess of flying coffee bean particles), but the coffee bean dispenser falls off if the grinder tips. It's cheap, but held up ""cheap"" too! We're getting a new grinder!"
1,shopping for a new one...,"I agree with the other reviewers...save your $$. The plastic teeth in the grinder broke, it's messy, loud, and cheaply made. If you grind beans daily like we do, don't buy this."
1,"Messy, messy, messy","The mill worked great until the dry winter weather came. The problem is static electricity. Coffee grounds spew everywhere. Too messy, too troublesome."
3,Mixed feelings,"I wholeheartly recomend this book to someone just starting out in plasma processing. It is THE best introductory book on the subject.However, if you have read the literature and have been exposed to the subject for a while, you will find that the book is very basic and a little outdated. Chapman used to be the VP of Technology for a Plasma Etch firm when he wrote the 1st edition. Now he is (and has for some time been) President of a vacuumn diagnostics company. He really has not been updating this. With that caveat, if the other books/literature is ""over your head"" - go to this book for simply to understand explanations of so called ""low temperature"" plasma phenemena."
4,Loved the cd,"Very enjoyable music, nice compilation of songs. Would recommend it to family and friends who enjoy similar types of music."
5,My first from Eric Bibb,This is a great CD...good song topics and wonderful lyrics. The music moved me and the soulful sound of the blues stirred my sprit and left me happier after listening to it.THANKS ERIC!
3,Works (DOESN'T WORK WITH VISTA x64),"The adapter is good and does it's work, but won't work straight out of the box with win vista x64"
4,Great seller and product but does not work for Nintendo Wii,"The seller got the product to me within 2 business days with regular shipping. Unfortunately, the jerks at Nintendo want you to buy only their products so this will not work with the Wii."
1,Does not work for Vista or the Wii,"This device doesn't work for Vista or the Wii. I bought it becuase when I searched for Wii Network adaptor it came up. Apparently it is not compadable with anything I own. HA, go figure. Atleast shipping was free. Too bad I won't return it because shipping it back costs almost as much as the cost of the item <$10 puchase..."
1,Worthless,Will not execute within Windows 7/ 64 bit. No response from customer service. No warning and no help.
4,Works Great,"Windows XP SP2 actually have inbox driver for this adapter. This means that all you need to use this adapter is to plug it in.If you use Windows Vista, you need to install the driver that comes with the installation disk."
2,Not Vista Compatible!,Is not Compatible with Windows Vista and Drivers are not available on the manufacturer's web site.
5,This External Usb NIC Works On Ubuntu,"This works great, and yes, it works on Ubuntu 9.10 and 9.04 out the box."
4,Nice Little Device,I purchased this device so that I could use ethernet on my chumby ([...]) and since it is supported by many versions of the Linux kernel without any extra drivers. This makes it incredably useful for netbooks as well to get a high speed data transfer connected with ease! I think it is a key part to any IT arsenal!
2,"Connects, but not 100bps","System works well..... it connects fine (the cord is longer than it needs to be)... but it only transmits data at ~5b/s.... I tried on 3 computers, then returned it for a replacement, and had the same issue.So... it's a good buy if you are only using to connect to DSL or Cable (since they are a similar speed), but if you want it for data transfer within your house, pick something else"
4,Low heat work smothly,"I bought a Linksys USB-Ethanet convertor before I bought this one. The Linksys is a HEATER. It's hot after a streaming use. The TrenDnet is a very good product. No installation needed, low heat, and it comes with cable."
5,So easy to use.,It was so easy to use and worked so wonderfully! Made me look like I know what I'm doing with computers!
1,Doesn't work with Nintendo Wii,I bought this specifically for my son's Nintendo Wii. It does NOT work with Wii; therefore I have absolutely no use for it.
4,good,"Overall, that's just worth the price. But sometimes it might stop work and maybe yoy have to reboot."
3,"Useless, with the exception of checking your email.","As others have stated, this device is USB 1.1, which makes it extraordinarily slow. I bought this since my daughter stuck a pencil in the ethernet port on my notebook. I usually use wireless so this isnt too much of a problem. However, I needed to transfer about 400-500 gigabytes of media to a NAS (Network Storage). I figured it would be more stable, and also quicker to go over wires. I was shocked to see the maximum speed it would transfer with this device is around 300-400kb per second, compared to about 10mb per second with an onboard NICWhat year is this again, 1999? Are USB 2.0 chipsets really that much more expensive for the manufacturer? Not to mention the lack of available information on this from Amazons description."
1,Product not for MS Vista,"Not to be used with MS Vista operating system. This was not specified until after I received the product> searched online for the driver, but found plenty of blogs and discussion about how long it would be before drivers would be available for Vista."
3,You get what you want,"I work in the computer business... So i deal with cheap, no good products all the time, and its frustrating when you get one of these cheap products to do a job and the first thing it does is break. Well, i bought this and had no such issue. Im glad to say that this item performed great, your getting everything you paid for in this package. :)"
5,easy installation!,"i just installed the adapter to my laptop and it works great! took me only 5 minutes to install, very easy instructions."
1,Good seller. Bad product,"The seller was great, but for the money the product was awful. The light is VERY DIM when it comes on at all. It is exposed to full sun all day but still preforms very poorly. My wife saw this in a magazine and loved it, so I ordered her one. We are both very disappointed in it. We have cheaper solar lights in our landscape that work wonderfully in even in conditions with less light. Let me state again that this is no fault of the seller, just a poor quality item."
1,solar globe lights,"I set up the light, with the solar collector facing the sun for 2 days, and it didn't work. A part that was supposed to keep the rechargeable batteries from running out was missing, so I assume that the batteries went flat. Since I don't have a charger, I'll have to buy new batteries to test the unit. If that doesn't work, I'll have to return it at my expense. Not satisfactory. I have many solar lights and this is the first one that gives me problems."
5,Great rangefinder alternative to Leica M7,"I have used many rangefinder cameras including Leica M6, M7, M8, M8.2, Voigtlander Bessa R4A, Minolta CLE, Zeiss Ikon and Hexar RF.Now I only keep Hexar RF.I love its bright view finder and solid build.Considering it price at 1/3 price of Leica M7.It is definitely a keep."
4,Delivered on basic promise,"The product worked almost as advertised, but... the information on the site and packaging says that you can use it on equipment up to 65 feet away, however it fails to mention that you'll need to purchase expensive extension mini-cable (even shopping for a deal it still cost another $50). The IR works well and in the end it met my needs, I just wish they were up front about only having about 12 feet of cable in the box."
2,Not recommended,Worked fine for a few months but over time took longer to boil cycling on and off and finally I think the element went out on it. Had the same model for years in Europe but I guess the one for the american market isn't made as well.
2,plastic inside,"The scale filter base is made of black plastic, which goes all the way to the bottom inside the kettle. My reason for choosing a more expensive stainless steel kettle was to avoid boiling water contact with the plastic. It is not possible to remove plastic parts from inside of this kettle, and I have to return it."
3,"Works great, for a while","We were pleased with this kettle, looks good, boils fast. However, after 16 months, it leaked and then stopped working (presumably something shorted out). Not terrible, but these things should last longer!"
4,shimmer bag,I have just received this bag today and I absolutely love it! The color is exactly as it appears on the website! It was the exact color I was looking for and it is beautiful!
5,Song List,"Songs include; Rise up And Praise Him, I Could Sing Of Your Love Forever, I Believe In Jesus, I Will Serve Thee. Practice versions are also included!!!"
1,NOT SUDSY!,"Though the picture clearly shows Sudsy Ammonia, Clear was sent instead.The description is deceiving. It looks as though it says Sudsy No. 00853, rather than No. 00851: Sudsy. When I put the pointer over the picture of Sudsy, it read 00853. I can get clear any time. I can't find the Sudsy -- which is really a good product and cleans really well -- in the stores."
1,Not as Described and way too expensive.,"This item is NOT clear ammonia as described; it has added coloring and surfactants. The weight was listed as 26 lbs; this plus the high price led me to believe that I was buying multiple bottles...nope, it was only one bottle. The price was many times the price of similar products in local stores."
5,They do the job!,"Very pleased with our stadium blankets!!! Took them to my son's double header - the high was 37 that day - and they kept us comfortable, whether they were laid across our laps or wrapped around our shoulders. The stitching is solid, they are light and fold up for easy transport with stadium seats and thermoses. Lots of colors, so your school spirit can shine. They will be hauled out for the really cold sports - like football - too! Go Tigers!! Go Katahdin Tek!"
5,Great Blankets!,These stadium blankets are awesome! Great quality at a fraction of the cost. I bought these blankets and had them embroidered as the senior gifts for our seniors on the soccer team and they loved them! Very soft and warm blankets. Gave this website to the under classmen's parents for future buys! Would definately buy from this company again!
2,I don't need more hassles in my life...,"My husband bought this for me because I hate the mess of bean dust everywhere after grinding my coffee beans every morning. The design looks like it would contain the debris better than your average grinder. Obviously if you want a mill grinder, you need to accept the fact that it's going to make more of a mess than the normal blade grinder. So to be fair, the poor rating is not because it makes more of a mess...The poor rating came from its durability- ours broke after just two weeks of use (the motor burned out) so we returned it for a refund vs. trying a second one.I didn't notice an improvement in the coffee, but it could have been my coffee maker vs. the mill."
1,Dissapointing burr grinder,"I bought this grinder after reading about the superior performance of burr grinders, compared to the usual whirly blade style. The design looked promising, and the price was right so I bought it. Unfortuately, with burr grinders, as with almost everything, you get what you pay for. This grinder is of very poor quality. In the few months that I have owned it (and it's successive replacement after the first one broke), the plastic upper hopper has broken twice, during normal use. The grinding mechanism jams all the time, and produces an inconsistant grind, varying from big chunks to dust. Additionally, it is impossible to get this machine to grind fine enough for use with an expresso machine. Save your money for a better grinder, this one is a paperweight."
2,Grind Extra Beans,"I purchased this grinder becuase of the ability to accurately change grind settings. While it does that, it has a major flaw. After the grinding takes place, there is so much static electricity in the grounds that some of the grounds are stuck to the sides of the plastic cup. It takes a spoon to get the beans out of the cup and into the filter. Pouring the grounds into the filter is a mesy process. I was never able to grind beans and transfer them to the filter without leaving a dirty countertop behind. The static electricity ony made the process harder since charged coffee grounds want to stick to everything they touch. I got in the process of grinding extra beans to make up for the spilled grounds. I was able to put up with the mess for about 3 weeks before I got frustrated and replaced it with a cheap blade-type grinder. Now my Black & Decker is retired to the closet waiting for the next garage sale."
2,"Okay, but not for any real coffee lover","It worked ok for a cheap burr grinder, but don't expect anything beyond that. Static build up is terrible. It takes longer to clean after each use (the chute for the coffee grounds clogs up) than it does to grind the beans. Considering all this I would recommend spending the money for a better grinder (Barista or Solis type class of grinder...) or if those are a bit pricey for your budget-- you might be better off with a simple blade grinder..."
1,Very Disappointed,"Besides being the noiseiest grinder that I have ever had it is also the dirtiest. The lower container does not seal completely from the ground coffee coming from the upper ""bean"" container and coffee grounds are thrown out of the grinder during the grinding process, coating the grinder exterior and the surface the grinder sits on. It is also a ""pain"" to clean. To add to my frustration, this product only lasted a few months and then the motor burned out."
1,Inconsistent grind. Poor construction. Loud.,"I must add my voice to the growing chorus of dissatisfied B&D; SmartGrind owners. My biggest complaint is that the size distribution of the resultant grind on any coarseness setting runs the gamut from superfine powder to large flakes. During the grind, I have to lay a towel over the seam between the unit and the grind collection cup to keep fine particles from flying out -- doesn't happen every time, and there's not a lot, but very noticeable against the white wall and countertop!I've had mine for about half a year now and use it 4 or 5 times a week. A crack has developed at the bottom of the whole bean cup (like that of the other reviewers here) and is slowly working its way up the side toward the lid. The final insult is that this device is LOUD: your neighbors will wonder why you're always doing small carpentry projects early in the morning..."
1,Not so smart,"I chose a burr grinder to replace a blade grinder to get a more uniform grind and especially to avoid the mess of having to scoop out the grounds. But this disaster of a product cannot grind coarse enough for a French Press, and in general, doesn't grind uniformly at all. And the mess! Instead of grind-and-scoop, now I have to grind, scoop, clean the counter, clean the base, clean the sides, clean the canister, clean the sink from dumping out the grounds in the base... Most inexcusably, the grounds build up in the chute so the machine clogs regularly. I only realized this when the motor started smoking! But now, to use it, I have to spend five minutes with a toothpick getting the insides clean. The folks who made the product obviously never bothered using it themselves on actual coffee beans. Or else they're just shameless. I should have returned it the first time I used it."
1,"Poorly designed, poorly made","Within 2 weeks of purchase, the grinders top receptacle split in half with only normal use (one pot each day). Within another week the lower canister fit so poorly that the ground coffee kept shooting out the sides of the machine. It is the most poorly designed appliance I have purchased in many years. The poor material used in its fabrication is completely unacceptable. If you buy one, you'll have to buy a replacement within weeks."
5,Beautiful Beginners Burr still running strong 5 years later,"I have now had my SmartGrind for over two years. I use high quality dark roasted beans for my coffee. I do have to go through a couple of contortions to keep the mess down. But the little effort I put forth for an enjoyable first cup, EVERY morning, is worth it. Occasionally the grinder will bog for a moment when the beans are particularly oily, other then that I love it. I do let the motor run for a second or two after the beans are crushed to clear the grinder. I just felt the urge to let everyone interested in this product know how good a long term value it is. Here it is 2010 and it is still gringing to perfection."
1,"Should be called ""DumbMess Deluxe Coffee Mill"".","Buyer beware! Yes it does grind the coffee but... the grinder easily clogs around the area where the grinds come out. When you pull the container out to get your ground coffee, the clogged coffee build-up makes it difficult to pull out. It does come with a cleaner type wand, but what a hassle to have to clean it throughly every time to be able to pull out the container! The other problem is, if you pick up the machine by the whole bean receptical, the receptical comes off in your hand and all of your beans spill everywhere!"
1,Pass...,"The motor on my B&D grinder burned out after only 6 months of very light use (on average every two weeks), so needless to say, I won't be purchasing another B&D. In fact, many of their products seem to be below parr these days."
1,Worst machine I've ever used,"We went through two of these machines in a week...one stopped working after 1 use and its replacement allowed two uses before the burning rubber smell. I didn't expect the quality and consistancy one would get with a burr grinder, but there were half sized coffee beans and very fine ground coffee when it finished grinding. They are messy and loud. I do not recommend this grinder."
2,Static buildup and big cracks.,"I got mine as an early father's day gift as a replacement for the Michael Graves blade grinder (also by B&D) and noticed that the grinds stick to the sides and lid of the cup. I assumed it was something that would subside over time but it hasn't really. The bean hopper developed a crack after a couple of months which expanded and now the entire section is kept intact by some packing tape. The little hump that keeps the beans flowing has broken off, probaly due to the constant tapping to try and keep the beans flowing into the grinder mechanism. Oh, and the lid for the grinds cup doesn't fit well resulting in a messy counter and a very annoyed wife."
4,"served me well, but...","This grinder has served well, but...the timer quit working soon after purchase, but hitting the button again to restart didn't trouble me as much as cleaning it and taking it back would have. I've used it for more than six months on a regular basis, nearly always at the finest setting, for dark, 'oily' French Roast [Starbucks] beans. I solved the static/mess problem quickly by discovering an empty glass jar [&quot;McCormick&quot; 8 fl. oz. Original-Premium Cocktail Sauce] fit perfectly in the grounds-recepticle and 'neatly' caught the flying coffee. Of course there was some that went into the plastic part, but 99% was in my snap-lid glass jar and not flying all over me or the kitchen! I then just popped the same jar in the fridge to store about 2 days of espresso-ground coffee. I've moved up [way up, to me] to a burr-type grinder and can get my espresso grind much, much finer of course, but for a new coffee nut, this is a great one to start with. Happy Brewing..."
1,"I received this as a gift, and still paid too much for it.","Too bad there's not an option to give it zero stars, because that is what it deserves. This grinder does a very good job of uniformly grinding the coffee. Getting the ground coffee into the coffeemaker is another matter, however. Every time I use it the mess it leaves behind is incredible. Also, you have to jiggle it to get the beans to move down the hopper. I have better things to do in the morning than stand there jiggling my coffee grinder and sweeping up after it."
2,Messy little thing....,"This is my first coffee grinder so I don't have a lot to compare it with, BUT....the damned thing makes a mess when you use it. I don't know a lot about similar models but I can't believe this is a very good one. I wish I had taken the time to read other buyers reviews before I bought it. On the upside...it seems to make a good cup of coffee but WHAT A MESS!"
1,"Hum, I wonder what I am not seeing here","I hate to be so negative, I am normaly very forgiving, but this is the worst grinder ever.- It is loud (but what grinder isnt)- The beans have trouble getting down into the blades for grinding (beans stored in freezer tend to stick together a little)- The seals on the lids easily allow grinds to fly out all over- Grinds collect on exit into the holder and they stick to the outside of the holder- ...My recommendation: TRY BEFORE YOU BUY!"
5,Just like Starbucks aroma and body,"This thing is GREAT! After having ground my own coffee for many years using a blade grinder I thought it was time to try grinding with a mill. Boy what a fantastic and pleasurable decision. Coffee prepped with this Mill will blow you away (I think the negative reviews must have come from Starbucks Managers).Robust body, aroma, and flavor rivals most high end coffee shops. Easy to use, you have control of the size of granule, and a timer to keep the power on long enough to finish the job. Start with Medium grind, and click toward fine one click at a time to find your favorite taste. Please follow directions, and TAKE YOUR TIME you'll be a happy camper. Easy to operate and clean (get a small brush), A great coffee mill at a cool Target price. Five stars with all thumbs up!"
1,"Bad, bad, bad","This is the worst grinder ever.- It is loud- The beans have trouble getting down into the blades for grinding- The seals on the lids easily allow grinds to fly out all over- Grinds collect on exit into the holder and they get everywhere- I cannot believe B&D; makes such an awful product, they should stick to power toolsBR>My recommendation: TRY BEFORE YOU BUY"
2,Grinding for Espresso? Fuggidaboutit!,"Probably okay if you need a grinder only for regular drip coffee. If you love expresso and want to grind at home, this machine is useless. Even at its finest setting, its not even close the the finess require for expresso!"
1,B&D has a sence of humor,"In these troubled times it's good to see a big company like Black & Decker has a sence of humor. I can't see how these guys put the Smart Grind Delux on the market with a straight face, but they seemed to do it. (Those wacky comsumer electronic guys). By my observation,the YUGO and this ""coffee mill"" must have been designed by the same guy. I do have to admit the coffee tastes better, but the 10 minute clean up of grinds and ""dust"" after each unfortunate milling event, especially in the ""caffine jones"" morning just seem to grind me. Good concept - TERRIBLE execution."
2,Another flimsy product,"I was thrilled with this grinder when I bought it; combined with my DeLonghi coffee maker, it made wonderful coffee. However, it broke four months after I purchased it. Buyer beware!"
1,Wear your ear plugs,"I got this from a local retailer and took it back to them for a refund after a few days for the following reasons: 1. No matter how much I experimented with the grind adjustments, I could never get a cup of coffee with any better flavor than with the blade grinder I already had. 2. This thing is horribly noisy and even if the coffee had tasted better, I'd probably still taken it back due to the possibility of hearing damage from using it everyday. 3. The coffee grounds clogged up inside the cup (as another reviewer mentioned). A total waste of thirty bucks- you'd be better off with a cheapie blade grinder like I'm still using until I find a real grinder."
1,I usually like Black and Decker - but this was a waste,"This grinder was a waste of money. After three months of use the plastic pieces began breaking off and the unit no longer works properly. Additionally, this was a MESSY unit. It would spray coffee grounds all over our kitchen. And it was also extremely loud.Don't purchase this item. Find something else. For your own sake."
2,Buy if you want to quit drinking coffee...,"After my tenth or so experience with this grinder, I had to come online and see if anyone else has the same issues I do with this product. The static electricity this grinder creates always results in grinds JUMPING out of the container when it is opened, and they litter my countertop and floor. I timed how long it took to grind and clean up for one pot of coffee today and it was 30 MINUTES. I can't imagine a person would do this every morning. I also had a plastic piece break off of the inside top by the press. I superglued it and it's held through one use since then. I wish this hadn't been a gift so I could ditch it and buy something more simple. DON'T waste your money because this will waste your TIME... unless you are trying to cut back on drinking coffee, because you won't want to deal with the hassle."
1,"Buyer Beware, a total waste of money","I purchased this item from Amazon nearly 3 months ago. It worked well in the beginning, then the whole-bean container cracked. I used some crazy glue to hold it together. Next, the start button seemed to be shorting out, requiring many restarts to finish a grind. Finally, the mechanism at the bottom of the bean receptacle (more ... plastic) broke off in two places. Today I got out my old grinder, and the Black and Decker will be sent to the garbage can where it belongs. I'm sorry that the review system requires one star since this product should get a minus."
4,Seems good,No complaints. Got about 1-1/2 hours of DVD play time from a fresh charge in my Dell Inspiron 8600. Better than the 10 minutes on my old worn out battery. Fits in the computer exactly like the original one. Price and delivery was good.
5,"Time are hard ,don't give your money away.",I was very pleased with the Dell Inspiron Latitude D800 battery I purchased off Amazon.com. I saved one hundred dollars buying this battery from Amazon than buying from [...].
5,Incredible Vibratory Sounds,"This is a wonderful CD if you are looking for something that will really help focus and clear your mind. It isn't music, but is rather a healing and centering experience.I like to play the CD and absorb the sound waves! Great for anyone the least bit interested in the effect of sound vibration on the body. Listening to the CD, and feeling it will really help clear you out."
1,in the trash,"I had enough of this S^&*T yesterday! It doesn't crush, it smells like burnt motor when I use it and it just plainly sucks. I was making icecream and it has a HARD TIME blending milk and tofu! poor quality machine...It is in trash..."
1,"Base is flimsy, has to be replaced repeatedly","An ""inexpensive"" appliance is not a bargain if it fails after making a scant 8 smoothies. I have had this blender for a little over a year, and I use it perhaps twice a month. Although I am not hurling it around or being in any way rough with it, the base continues to crack. (Of course, NOW i feel like hurling it around...) B&D has replaced the base twice, as it was covered by warranty, but very shortly after putting the new base on it, it too develops hairline cracks. Shoddy materials and design! So that's $20 wasted that I could have spent on a product that would not eat up my time attempting to obtain replacement parts, and would have a reasonable lifespan. Really, if you get your butt kicked by a smoothie, you aren't much of a blender! (Yeah, I'm talking to you, ProBlend!)"
2,It leaks,"I have it for about a year, but I use it very seldom.Crushes ice, frozen berries, apples, etc - excellent. Mixing perfect and blends great. However it leaks badly, hard to clean and replacement parts are impossible to find."
1,Really bad engineering; stay away,"The original blender I received from Amazon was pretty much dead-on-arrival. The first time I tried to crush some ice in it, the blades got stuck in the ice cubes and the motor smoked away to death!! Amazon was extremely prompt and courteous in sending out a replacement even before I could ship the original unit back to them, but unfortunately, the repacement unit had much the same problem. There seem to be a fundamental engineering flaw in the blender. The only air vents for the motor are small slits in the bottom of the base, and the small feet on the bottom are so little that there is only a very thin venting space for the motor to suck in air to cool down.Anyway, I am returning mine and will be looking for a replacement at Amazon. I urge you to stay away from this creation of shoddy engineering."
1,Motor blew on the third use.,"Was not an impressive blender to begin with, and now it's dead, so I'm returning mine & I would urge you to look elsewhere."
1,Dead Blender!,"I bought this blender less than a year ago, and now i'm looking to get a new blender since it just died this weekend.I had a problem with the blade assembly that got isolated from the motor I think...Still every time I used it the motor will smell like burnt rubber so I was always scared to use it too much!Don't waste your money on this one, the only nice thing about it is the glass jar."
1,Blade assembly siezes up,"I've had the blender less than 4 months when the blade assembly siezed up. The motor appears to work fine, although it does tend to smell occasionally. I tried taking it apart and greasing it, but still would not spin. Also, I burnt myself while taking it off the stand to wash it. Apparently, the rubber is steaming hot! I did not put a lot of demands on this blender, just an occasional smoothie for myself. I would not recommend this blender."
2,Replace me!,"It worked Ok for almost two years. Like the other reviewers, I am beginning to see how much of a piece of junk it is. The blade on mine quit while trying to crumb Oreo cookies. If the thing can grind ice then crumbing Oreaos should be a piece of cake. I have looked on Amazon, other shopping sites, and Black and Deckers webpage. However, I cannot find a replacement blade. I am waiting for a response from B&D; to see how much the part will cost and how much it will cost to get it to me.I can sympathize witht the other reviewer about the price of parts. My B&D; coffeemaker carafe broke when I went to fill it with water. The thing just shattered, no dropping it or banging it, it just shattered. The carafe was half the cost of a new and better maker. Therefore, I just decided to get another brand of coffee pot.Meanwhile, I am looking into purchasing an Oster or a Hamilton Beach blender which both sell replacement parts on Amazon."
1,Pureed a few apples and then died,My new blender barely pureed 5 or so apples and then died. They want it shipped for repair. Not sure if there is a fuse inside since there are four screws in the bottom and one is some sort of a triangle shaped one you can't open. Don't buy!
4,Clifford was the favorite gift!,I gave Clifford to my nephew for his first birthday. During the party the other three three years olds and the one two year old all monopolized the toy never letting the one year old get a chance to use him! This toy was easy to put together and rides easily and smoothly. I am not convinced that it is the most durable toy (only time will tell) but it's first day the previously mentioned toddles took some down slope spills on Clifford and he stayed strong.Overall a great gift for a one year old who was just learning to walk and ride!
3,"Not as bad as Maltin thinks, several good moments.","Stewart does a good job in her scenes with Praed, considering that he was blue-screened in as a hologram in most of them. Des Barres also plays a fantastic role as Jon Winderman, a telepath that's gone around the bend. I also enjoyed the change from the standard ""cramped space ship"". It's made clear in the film that the ship was originally a freighter designed for infrequent shore-leave - something that should have a lot of space and a certain amount of creature-comforts, and the settings are in keeping with this."
4,Beach hat,Love this hat for the beach and love the extra large size for my big head. Don't expect it to last for more than one year but for the price I can buy another next year
5,Hilarious!!,"I wont bore you with another re-cap of the movie, every other review has done a fine job at that. I do have to admit I was a little skeptical in watching this because it has Raven Symone in it and I automatically think of the over acted, annoying and ridiculous show ""all about Raven"". But I dont know who I liked better, her or Joanna Garcia, they are both totally adorable in this movie. Raven is hilarious and definentley shines as the sarcastic and sometimes tempermental best friend while Joanna's character is level-headed and supportive. Both girls are lovable!! You must watch this!"
2,Not as good as Bridesmaids,I bought this as a gift for my daughters. They said they didn't like it. It's not anything like the first one.
3,this movie was not all that cracked up to be,"I only watched it because Raven was in it, it was mean how they picked at her weight in the movie knowing she was sensitive about it in real life. All in all I give this movie a B minus."
5,PROS & CONS,"PROS:-Gorgeous, classy, and sophisticated!-Writes smoothly.-Owning such a luxurious pen makes me feel good about myself.-The platinum is so shiny I get distracted when I use it! I stop writing and just obsess over how lovely the pen is!-Comfortable, smooth grip.-Comes in a fasionable case.CONS-This pen is somewhat large and heavy. Probably more comfortable for a man to use."
5,Top-Notch Autobiograpy,"A top saxaphonist who was active from the 1940s through the 1970s. Amazing life story. A tumultuous life, covered in detail. Book is about much more than music. Pepper goes deep down inside of himself. Jam-packed with never-boring stories. He achieved acclaim as a musician, became a heroin addict, was involved in crime, went to prison, lived for years in a rehab facility (sort of a cult) called Synannon, in order to break his addiction. Reclaimed his music career (to a point). Takes place largely in L.A.--takes you into the jazz world of the forties and fifties in L.A., the funky clubs, musicians and jazz fans, hotel rooms. Also takes you on the road across America, and covers a brief period during and after WW2, when Pepper was very young, in France. Pepper also has a unique perspective, coming from the jazz world and being white, while the majority of his fellow musicians are black."
5,a spiritual autopsy told in the first person,"This is the story that Art Pepper might have told God after his death. He just opens a vein and lets it all spill out on the floor. Why should he clean it up? God already knows. It's the confession of a man who has nothing to lose. Is it pretty? Well, its human. So, are human beings pretty? Yes and no, and everything in between. Thats an expansive realm, and Art fills it with the only thing he has left, his soul."
2,Not a jazz fan anyway,The book doesn't flow well and too much dialogue from others about gigs and jazz. Just not a book for me
3,interesting but depressing,"The person I gave this gift to found Art's life a bit weird and depressing. It was definitely a book he'll keep, but not exactly uplifting."
2,Big +++ on his Music. . .,"not much to like in this bio. A not very interesting or well penned telling. If I have an hour to spare, I'd much rather listen to his music then read this book. And that's exactly what I am doing next."
1,Didn't finish it.,It became obvious early in the book that this guy was going to whine his way through the whole thing..
4,Concorde Chair,This is a wonderful chair. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it will not be able to stay as wonderful as it is now. It may last me as good as it is now. I hope it does! Everything works exellent! But you have to wait and see. Kevin Mills
5,"I like it, I just like how it sounds.","On this the latest disc by Roy Hargrove's RH Factor, you find a combination of warm melodies, funky deep bass groves, slick vocals and the lovely-mellow harmonies of Hargrove's trumpet. Which he uses to good effect, by placing little soundbites of horn in strategic places, for maxium effect. That is old school funk influenced by new school sounds. And just so that it is perfectly clear this guy is the real deal on the instrument. Keep in mind that he also has a second disc (which is gorgeuos) of Acoustic Jazz out with his Quartet. Not to mention that this is his #? release over the last decade. Proving that anything that he is playing is clearly by choice. And either you get it or you don't."
3,More good stuff...,"Nobody since Miles Davis has fully explored the possibilities that a jazz sensibility can offer as well as Roy Hargrove. The third album by the RH Factor continues this tradition, but without the excitement of the earlier discs. While this may simply be a result of playing the previous albums too much, it might be also be due to a vocal treatment that's starting to sound a little too familiar. However, when playing this and Roy Hargrove's new straight jazz album, Nothing Serious, on ""random"" mode it made for a beautiful couple of hours."
4,Pleasantly suprising,"I'll have to admit that I was pretty thrown off by the Explicit Lyrics label. However, I was totally taken off guard by this album. It was really great. It grooved. It took the music to a whole notha' level.I don't give it 5 stars because there were a couple sections where it was a bit slow, and a bit repetitive. But I was surprised by the album. I am a big fan of Erykah Badu, and this album is in the Badu tradition. There were some great solos and great horn lines. I'm going to listen to this a few times more so I can really get inside the music."
3,Holy Scent too strong Batman!,"Great product; moisturizes very well. We live in Southern California where the humidity can drop to 12% when the Santa Ana winds blow. This is the perfect remedy for those days. It lasts all day, and eliminates the need for lotion after the shower. However; wow the scent is way too strong. I hate to use it before bed as it just clings. If anyone from Dove reads these reviews - please, please consider reducing the level of the scent and/or replacing it with something mild like the old original Dove bar soap scent."
2,Musky Scent,"I've been using Dove Body Wash the past 3-4 years. It's a high quality body wash that doesn't dry the skin. I recently tried the latest evolution of the product, now called, ""Deep Moisture."" Undoubtedly, this new Dove provides even greater moisturizing, it's impressive. However, I cannot use this product. It has a ""musky"" scent that the previous version did not. The scent remains on your body throughout the day. I'll use the remaining ""old version,"" I have while I hunt for a replacement body wash."
4,"Leave your skin clean, healthy, and nourished","I've been using Dove'ssensitive skin body washfor years. I have sensitive skin, I've seen a dermatologist in the past for treatment and recommendations, and Dove works for me. I decided to try the deep moisture formula to change things up.The sensitive skin formula may have changed a bit over time, but it's been great and I haven't had any qualms about it. Deep moisture is very, very similar, except that it has a scent which I'm on the fence about. Scent aside, this wash leaves my skin feeling clean, healthy, and nourished.I'm such a creature of habit that I feel naked without it on the road. Do yourself a favor - ditch the fruity, scented, cheap soap and treat your skin with care. Go Dove or go home!"
5,I LOVE this product!!,Great for my skin; leaves me soft and moisturized. Wonderful smell; I can't say enough! Great body wash. Dove has done it again!
4,IT WORKS GOOD!!!,THIS BODY WASH WAS WORKING GOOD AND THE SMELL WAS GREAT. I LIKE THIS BODY WASH. THE PRICE WAS GREAT. MY FAMILY LIKE IT TOO. IT'S GOOD PRODUCT.
4,Dim cymraeg,"Old things have their own irrational fascination and I suppose this book is meant for amusement rather than edification. The authors do suggest that these survivals (which in many cases are recent re-creations of dubious historical authenticity) represent someting positive about Britain. They suggest that respect for tradition produces stabilty. They do not address the possibility that this sort of thing feeds into snobbery and class bias.I was intrigued by the strong Scottish representation and lack of anything Welsh. Symbols of Welsh identity were obliterated by the central government to such an extent that even the flag of Great Britain contains only the crosses of St George, St Patrick and St Andrew. Why was this? Wales was the one country of the British Isles to retain the primary badge of national identity, a separate language.But perhaps this taking the book too seriously. It's enjoyable and often funny and the pictures are great."
5,you say 'potato' and i say 'wow!,"who, other than the irish, could ever, would ever have thought of so many wonderful ways to serve up spuds? three cheers for this hefty tome dedicated to red, white and blue tubers. if only the incas could see this book! mine is destined to be grease-, milk-, cream-, cheese- and butter-spattered in no time."
4,Interesting,"I was attracted to this book from the title of course - in addition my family of six - only one other person than myself eats pasta, rice, etc. How many different ways can you cook potaotes? I don't know that I'll will actually make a lot of the recipes, several are not ""kid friendly"". Maybe some modified recipes, the book is inspiring and it is very interesting to read about the different kind of potaotes. I would probably check it out at the library first in hind sight. Only I am new in town and don't know where the library is just yet."
2,Okay but could be allot better,"There were allot of typical potato recipes in here; pancakes, mashed etc. but many ethnic ones were not. I think you could do allot better just getting Fannie Farmet and reading her potato section than wasting your money on this.Few pictures round this out and the pages are potatoey coloured.Rather uninspired book."
5,Love it!,"I have a copy of this book and love it.My friend saw it and wanted one too! Great recipies!! What a great price,I spent twice as much on my first one. A must have for those that love potatoes!"
1,TERRIBLE,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS VIDEO. IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK IT IS. VERY MUCH NOT WHAT I THOUGHT. THIS SITE IS . NO NO NO NO !!!
5,Fabulous,"A this was a gift in 1999. Some of the recipes have become regulars during the holidays at my house -- Trio of Fruit Salsa cranberry sauce, sweet potato biscuits. Decorating ideas still promote excitement from guests -- the ballet look on dining chairs with ribbon, gorgeous. As a result, I'm shopping for more Better Homes and Gardens Celebrate the Season."
1,Badly designed lock,"Well, I am very dissapointed with this security lock, especially after reading good reviews about it. It looks very nice, thick cable etc. However, the lock system is not very well designed. After setting a specific combination, and attaching it to my laptop, it suddenly died for no reason. It wouldnt open again, or randomly open at some other combiations. What a nightmare it was! Anyway, I returned it, the lock is obviously not very well constructed. So be careful. Of course, there is a chance that my particular lock was broken, just make sure you test it before attaching it to a notebook."
2,"Great features, poor quality","I bought this toaster after reading the good reviews on other sites. I loved the 4 wide-slots, but the toast/bagel switch is what really drew me in. I loved being able to toast on one side only, say for bagels or hamburger buns.Unfortunately, it would do that all the time! No matter which setting I used, it would toast fine on one side, but the other side of the toast would be barely toasted at all. After recieving my first toaster, I thought ""Okay, I guess this one is defective..."". I sent it back for a replacement unit. Well, the same thing happened to the second one. Finally, I returned the toaster for a full refund.I was quite disappointed, since I own many other Black & Decker items, and have never had any problems with them."
2,I made the mistake of buying this toaster twice,I bought this toaster at a warehouse near my home. I like the design of it and it toast four slices or it is supposed to. Neither toaster lasted a year. I was dissappointed as I thought Black and Decker was a good product. I would not buy another one. I hope this helps someone else from making my mistake and spending [money] and now have to buy another toaster.
1,A Big Mistake,"Despite other negative reviews on this toaster, we purchased it and are now looking for a new one. Within one week, one of the handles fell off and couldn't be reattached. Within another month the second handle fell off. Thankfully we haven't had any heating element problems but we're not taking any chances. I wonder if Black and Decker ever reads these reviews?"
1,Horrible!,"I needed a 4-slice toaster for my family and I bought one. Unfortunately, I can't use it. The left sides works (poorly), the right side works whenever it has a mind to. The lever for the right side toast will not stay down. The left side toasts but it is uneven or just one side and somtimes burns corners of the toast. I am very unhappy with this purchase. I will never buy another Black & Decker toaster ever again."
2,Not Built to Last,"I originally loved this toaster and rate it a 5. It broke about a year after I bought it. The pop-up feature on one side started to slip lower and lower so I couldn't easily retrieve the toast. I fiddled with the handle, which seemed to fix that problem but broke the handle off. Now it's got an ugly, broken handle and is slipping lower and lower again. This toaster is not built to last. How many years have people been making toasters? Shame on you Black & Decker for creating products of such poor quality that my review and others have to warn people away from buying them!"
1,Unimpressed With Toaster's Abilities,"I read the other reviews on here. Debated on whom to listen to, and made the wrong choice. I am glad that I had a coupon and didnt pay more then 10.00 for it. Sometimes this toaster only toasts one side of the bread...even on the correct setting. If its perfect toast you long for...do yourself a favour and look elsewhere."
2,This is a Horrible Game,"I like Constantine. I have two DVDs of the movie, the original release and the one with the bonus disk. You could say I really like the movie.This game is horrible. Control? Horrible. Textures? Horrible.I had to try it, as I find the movie so full of potential, but this game is very bad."
5,This game is GREAT!,"Some people say the movie was bad, but i loved it. to day it just came out and i bought it. i also hope to get the game. Keanu might not voice act in the game but the game is a classic. don't listen to the bad game reviews. the controls are good. the demons are sweet. at times i almost crapped my pants. the weapons are cool. the game will keep you busy. the graphics are good. DO NOT RENT THIS GAME, BUY IT. the best thing about it is that it is cheap. you can get new for 20 bucks. this is a must buy game so BUY IT!"
2,Cyongear Purple Silicone Phone Case,"If the product would have lasted, I loved it! I used it for about a week and it ripped. I used it normally, no rough anything on it...it just gave out! Waiting for the other side to tear (which will be soon) and then the silicone case will just fall off..."
1,Don't Buy This Machine!,"I bought the Bosch compact mixer about a year ago. The salesman promised me it would perform just as well as the larger mixer, simply do smaller quantities. Well, I have now used it on almost every possible type of recipe and the only thing it mixes well is a packaged cake mix. Cookie dough takes forever to mix. Cheesecake never gets smooth. Likewise with mashed potatoes. My bread dough doesn't get kneaded properly and turns out heavy and coarse. When I called Bosch's customer service to complain, they told me they couldn't compensate me just because I don't ""like"" the machine. Do yourself a favor. Buy a KitchenAid or a Sunbeam instead. That's what I'm going to have to do."
3,Fryer doesn't seem to reach 375,I also have the same issue as others where it just takes FOR EVER to fry with this thing. Frys and Chicken wings 20 to 30 min sometimes adn sometimes longer.It does work I do like the design but have always hated how you just don't get that deep fry cook like you should get and it is because of the temperature not working properly.
3,Fair Condition,"Contents are good. Condition of the cover was not what I consider new.Partial ""reduced price"" stickers stuck to the cover, and the remnantshard to remove. Corners were bent; scratch on the front cover.Overall condition not as expected."
4,for high school,"While objections might be appropriate for high-end poets and advanced university students, I have found this book quite helpful at an introductory high school level. It is short and to the point, and does not overly discourage a young student trying to become acquainted with traditional poetic forms."
5,Norton Anthology of Poetry Forms,"Excellent book. All the poetic forms analyzed according to form, historical developed, and their modern application. Each chapter offers many examples, again from the past for the present. A great aid for both literary aficionados and writers."
3,Good selection but confusing,"While it's true that both authors picked wonderful poems for each genre, they confuse the reader who is trying to learn how each poem is made. They have a half page dedicated to outlining what rules for each poem are and then every other poem they chose ends up breaking those rules. For the novice poet it is extremely confusing. i.e. Okay, this is 14 lines in iambic pantemeter...wait, this is 18 lines and no syllables are stressed!The give half-hearted definitions of words used in poetry too that aren't referenced in the beginning or middle of the book. They are randomly placed beore bibliographies.I think the authors should have just made this a poetry collection book because other than their introduction, reading ABOUT how poems are made and their history is dull and short. I can't believe we(my class) are using this for a textbook honestly."
1,Scanty Coverage,"These two poets rarely write in poetic form themselves, and it shows. The book is sketchy and often superficial in its treatments of the forms. For a much more thorough look at a much wider range of forms, check out the new book AN EXALTATION OF FORMS: CONTEMPORARY POETS CELEBRATE THE DIVERSITY OF THEIR ART."
1,Not worth your money,"There is definitely a need for such books on poetic forms today, but this book does not fill that lacuna adequately. As has been noted, the editors are not poets of the first rank (despite the fact that Mark Strand was a poet laureate of the US) and are not unquestionable masters of form. So, while this book may serve a scant few beginners, there remain better other options.I would suggest checking out John Hollander's excellent short work ""Rhyme's Reason"". He goes over more forms and in a better style than in this book. If you are a poet yourself, definitely you should choose Hollander's book over this one. However, if you want an easy and light read, maybe this book is better, since it provides longer ""readings"" of certain poems. But if that's what you're after, you'd be better served by Harold Bloom's ""How to Read and Why"", a very good book written by a top scholar and yet readable by virtually anyone interested in literature."
4,The Making of a Poem,It was informative. It was a required text. It arrived in good condition and I used it extensively in the Senior Citizen poetry class.
3,Not exactly as expected,"The tailgate that was delivered had a new ""ECO"" finish applied, not polished aluminum as I expected. Basically, it is painted shiny gray. Still a very nice unit, just maybe not what you expect finish-wise."
1,TRANS FATS,"I was really excited to get this product. Calcium + Vitamin D all in a fantastic piece of chocolate. What could be better? However, in looking at the nutrition information, I found that trans fat was not labeled. This told me right away that this product must be pretty old because requirements for labels were made at the beginning of last year. Scanning through the ingredients I found it. Hydrogenated oils. I felt so betrayed! A product that claims to be so healthy, while at the same time containing trivial amounts of trans fat! I suggest looking for other methods to obtain your calcium. Supporting this cheap way companies get around shelf life is sooo not worth it!"
3,Tastes great but made me queasy,"I was super excited to try this product: had heard great things from friends and was looking for a way to increase my calcium intake that did not require consuming a ton more dairy products. I enjoyed the taste of these - but sadly, they made me queasy every time I ate them. After numerous attempts I ended up throwing most of the container away. But if you are short on calcium I'd still recommend the product, especially if you have a strong stomach."
3,Free and easy with the prose,"How this transalation appears to you really depends upon the purposes for which you are reading it. Lacey is quite free and easy with the prose, something which personally I find an advantage as it makes Cicero very 'readable' as it were. For the scholar studying Latin, rather than history, another edition would probably be a better idea.To the Phillipic itself, it is a must-read for anybody studying the late Roman republic. Cicero's vile attack upon Antony is world famous and has been passed down through history. Seperating fact from fiction, with all the exaggerations in between, is quite a task, but despite the fact that a good half of what Cicero claims simply was not true, it is an invaluable source for this period in history."
3,"For the general reader, this translation is compelling","The Classics student may find, despite the traditionally brilliant 'Loeb' style format, that the English translation version of this book is too free and not accurate enough. However, as Lacey admits himself, this was never his purpose. Lacey produced this book for literary interest and not strict accuracy to the latin and, in this, he is extremely effective and makes Cicero come alive for classicists and ordinary people alike."
3,Entertaining book,I think that Dike The Wolf is a fun book to tell little kids so they woun't get separated from they'er family.And so they woun't be a loner. stick together 4 ever.
4,Tristano - Continuity,"The first 4 tracks are from a live gig October 1958 at the half note NYC with Warne Marsh, Henry Grimes and Paul Motion. The last 3 tracks are from June 1964 at the half note NYC with Lee Konitz . Warne Marsh, Sonny Dallas and Nick Stabulas. sound is decent playing is good ..........enjoy"
5,Peyton Manning Reebok Play Action Indianapolis Colts T-Shirt,Hubby loved adding this shirt to his collection and white looks so good on him. Now we have to start buying Bronco's as he is so into Manning
2,Jacket Was Not What I Expected,It does look like a work of patches but instead of being a size too small i ordered two sizes too large. Jillian leather doesn't answer emails and they only have xxl and up on their site for this style jacket. if your going to buy this i wear an xl usually but a medium probably would have fit me.
5,An excellent album...,"Mezmerize was very good but it was a mix of really good songs followed by a few that just did not fit in and made the whole album kind of shallow for lack of a better word. Don't get me wrong...I like the first as well but something was missing.Even though Hypontize doesn't have strong hits like B.Y.O.B or Question the overall quality of the songs and lyrics is fenomenal. And it all flows together from start to finish...no songs about Hollywood (thank god). It sounds like a mature version of Mezmerize. I meant that as a compliment. This album is a very pleasant suprise. I expected a dud. Man was I wrong.As far as the DVD side...who cares...sure we got a few extras but that is just what they are...extras...icing on a freaking cake. If you gonna complain about it and rate that, then you must be a spoiled brat and you should not be listing to this group to begin with. But I guess I am impartial to it since I only paid a dollar more for the dual disk option."
5,Got this at midnight,"I was one of the first people to get this album at midnight of the release. I must say, this album is wonderful. System of a Down is the most intelligent band I've ever heard and their message is more powerful than ever in Hypnotize. I absolutly loved this album from the second it started to play. Anyone who is a fan of this band should see them live. It is a glorious treat for your eyes and ears. If you have Mezermize go get this album today. If you have any System of a Down cd, get Mezmerize and Hypnotize today. This album may not be as good as Toxicity, but then again, there really aren't many albums out there that are. Get this cd and enjoy some new System of a Down."
2,2 Stars for the track HYPNOTIZE,"I sit her and listen to SOAD, TOXICITY, and most of STEAL THIS ALBUM!, and i was stupid enough to rush myself into wasting money on Mesmerize, which DOES have its moments... but i truly believe that Hypnotize is 100% filler... I've never been dissapointed by this band... they did it though...and jesus, serj, cut your hair... you look rediculous man"
2,dissapointing,"I got this album last week, and was sorely dissapointed. I'm a System of a Down fan, and had been looking forward to this after the briliance of Mezmerize. But, I find it impossible to get in to. The only stand out tracks are Hypnotize and Soldier side which continues from the Soldier side intro on Mezmerize."
1,I was expecting more,"After Mesmerize, well, mesmerized me, I was expecting its sister album to be equally gripping. Unfortunately, for me at least, this album is a ""one hit wonder"", and even that hit I cringe when I hear it (too many years of classical choir training make their attempts at a hard rock ballad painful). I've tried listening to the album several times, to see if it will grow on me ... it didn't. And now, with Mesmerize playing in the background, I can firmly say that this new album by SOAD fell FAR below my expectations. I hope that whatever Muse watched over them for Mesmerize re-visits soon."
2,"pull the mic away from your face, HEY!!!!!!!!!","daron please shut the f@#ck up. just play guitar and sing backup vocals. i love the 1st 3 system albums, but these last to are just average at best. one of the main reasons i like system so much is serj's singing. now daron seems to think he's the lead singer. it's pretty sad that there b-side album is better than these last 2 so called albums. serj grow some balls and tell daron if he wants to sing, release a solo project and leave the singing to serj on the next system album."
4,Perfect Linkage for Mezmerize,"System produced a grand sequel for Mezmerize. Four of the 12 songs have great rythm, harmonic structure, and lyrics for the genre: Soldiers Side, Lonely Day, Hypnotize and Holy Mountains. The other 8 songs are a bonus. Buy this album from Amazon, they had the guts to sell the ""Explicit Lyrics"" and deserve kudos -- the language wasn't as salty as previous SOAD albums -- for delivering the music as it was written by the artists."
4,Great album,"All I have to say about this album specifically (and mezmerize too) is that it's very good. It certainly isn't the best thing I've ever heard in my life, but it's more than worthy of its price.More importantly, I thought it was worth replying to all the hate against Daron's voice. He's really not a bad vocalist, I enjoy his solo parts, but the best thing about his newfound confidence in singing is the harmony parts with Serj. The two have such contrasting voices, yet they really interact and just work so well together, it's the best thing about this System Of A Down in its current incarnation. Disagree with me, but I don't care. These two are brilliant."
3,Return to form. A better form.,"I was a fan until Toxicity was released then they got predictable and boring. This on the other hand is much better than their three previous releases.The album itself has varied material but overall it sort of blends.Highlights include Holy Mountains, Vicinity Of Obscenity (completely insane but cool), Hypnotize, and Lonely Day.Daron does as much singing as Serj on this one which is a plus.Serj even sings better which I did not believe possible.I really give it a 3.5/5 and thats a lot coming from me. I hated them from Toxicity until this release. Overall it's a worthwhile purchase and proves a band can redeem themselves after a while."
4,"good cd, but bad format","I've never heard of a cd that doesn't work with all cd players. I was disappointed to find out that my home player won't play it. I think they should make a law that says in order for bands/producers to sell their cd's, they should make it work on all cd players. Luckily, it works on my portable cd player. I haven't tried the one at work yet, but I'm crossing my fingers. Otherwise, GREAT!!"
4,System Of A Down - A Unique Band,"I can't think of any other band that sounds like these guys. They are truly unique and although I don't like everything that they do, there is certainly a lot of talent to be found here. The music combines elements of Nu-metal, progressive rock, and Zappa-ish mayhem. Some of it is funny, some serious and some just plain over the top. Lead vocalist Serj Tankian has an almost operatic voice that is very different from anyone else I can think of out there. The band remind me a bit of The Mars Volta at times, although SOD's music is more blunt and to the point. Highlights include ""Attack"", ""Kill Rock N Roll"", ""Lonely Day"", and ""Soldier Side"". This is a band that I have to be in the right mood to listen to, and I kind of have to take them in small doses, but there is no doubt that SOD are one of the more unique bands in mainstream rock today."
4,Getting better,"How many bands come out with two albums in one year? ""Hypnotize,"" following closely behind the release of ""Memorize,"" is the stronger album of the two. Perhaps they were conceived as one larger project, I don't know, but they are very similar. While not exactly a great band, SOAD is one of the more interesting groups putting out material today. A worthy follow-up to ""Toxicity."""
3,"Okay, here is a real review.","I'm not under 13. Just thought you should know.First of all, I will review the Audio side. The music is great but it is not without its flaws. Stealing Society's lyrics seemed silly as well as She's Like Heroin. That's about it. 4 out of 5 on the audio.Now, on the dvd side. It sucked. Only two music videos? What the hell was that? Plus there weren't any music vids from Hypnotize! Then when I saw the Recording of Mezmerize and Hypnotize. I didn't hear anybody else except Daron! John did talk but that was only for a short amount of time. Also, you did get to hear Serj sing for a little bit as well. Enhanced audio...I couldn't tell the differance. It sounded the same as the audio side did in my stereo...all in all, the dvd gets a 1 out of 5. Overall Score: 3 out of 5.So there are my thoughts. You can disagree all you want but that won't influence my opinion."
2,serj and daron are thieves!!!!,"serj and daron imitate the vocals of the band Ruins to the point that its sickening. people constantly talk about how original serj's vocals are...and here he is ripping Ruins off, simply because he knows that very few people listen to them! same thing happened with the smashing pumpkins, when they totally ripped the intro from What's Going On from Husker Du, and then they used it on the song 1979. do me a favor and listen to the song Iron Lady from Ruins, from the record Stonehenge, and tell me that serj hasn't listened to that record. by the way, Ruins came first."
1,It was the beginning of the end.......,"Daron Malakian really ruined this record. Remembered when GNR had Duff and Izzy sing on songs? luckily they were on 3 tracks in a 2 album span. Unfortunately, Daron sucks worse at singing and he looks like an Iraqi Pee Wee Herman!She's like heroine.... no daron, she doesn't. She just doesn't like your singing on this song!Hypnotize... was this about suckering fans into buying records cuz they were hypnotized through the greatness of the Toxcity record?Attack!... fans should start yelling at Daron for his crappy vocals on this CD.U-Fig - Do you mean F U Daron?Daron (who looks like the Iraqi Weird Al) should be really upset about this record. Actually he is cuz isn't this band on hiatus.Terrible album, keep away!"
3,Don't belive the hype,"All and all this was a O.k album, Not as great as people say it is1. Attack: I liked it better, When it was called ""Master Of Puppets""2. Dreaming: Kinda Sucks3. Kill Rock 'N Roll: Yuck4. Hypnotize: The solo part is pretty cool5. Stealing Society: Yawn6. Tentative: Another yawn7. U-Fig: Weird, Insane, Demented... I liked it8. Holy Mountains: Neo-Prog meets Death Metal. Not that great9. Vicinity Of Obscenity: Serj must have been on acid when recording this. I love it10. She's Like Heroin: Sucky11. Lonely Day: Ok i guess12. Soldier Side: Another ok song.So in other words kinda overrated."
2,"Great Music, but don't buy the album","This CD comes with some kind of copy protection and other things. It has one of those notices, The CD won't play in all players. I called SONY and they told me to bug off. This disk won't play on my Windows machine, even worse it won't play in my car. I have a plain-old JVC 12 disk changer, nothing special. But it won't play. It's very dissapointing that a band like SOAD would put out a CD you can't play. ""Steal this Album"" yeah right."
5,love it,My nephew loved it. He listens to it constantly. He put it into his ipod and listens to it while he plays online.
3,ok,"Decent but mesmerize is defintley the better album. It's a little softer and almost a pop type sound, which was completly unexpected by me."
2,Not my type of music,"I heard ""Lonely Day"" on the radio and thought it was a pretty good song. But when I bought the album, practically none of the songs were of that type. It's my fault for not listening to this cd before purchasing."
2,What happened?,This album along with mezmerize was the biggest dissapointment! Serj needs to sing and daron needs to stick to guitar and back up vocals. I hate to say this but I think there best has come and gone. Daron's voice sounds awful and if he sang as much back in self titled and toxicity they would not be as big as they are now. Horrible and they got two stars just because I love there old stuff so much.
1,SOAD RIP thanx to Daron,"This album just like hypnotized is garbage and is a disgrace to the great early two albums. the songs are not as good , but basically the main reason is because serj is the man and daron sux. he is literally the worst singer i have ever heard. Serj did so great on the first two and even steal the album was good(it was better before the commercial release)but ever since then daron is slowly taken serj's place. i wont be surprised if serj isnt even on the next album. do yourself a favor and buy toxicity or their self titled album instead of this crap. that guys voice is like needles in my ears. let sej sing again or i think soad is already done."
4,What I expected from the NEW System of a Down...,"This album is about the same thoughts i had on Mezmerize, fun to listen to, but gets kinda annoying after awile. This has a few memorable songs, my favorite is Soldier Side. Dont get me wrong, this is a good effort from System, but nothing compared to thier first two albums. I have been a fan for about four years, I liked it alot better when Daron only played guitars, and thier music was harder. Saying that though, change isn't necessarily always a bad thing."
3,Hypnerize?,"i downloaded this album, and played it in my car for a few days. i own the others, except steal this album, which i guess is a little ironic. but enough about me. if you do the right thing and buy hypnotize, you may find that it was actually the wrong thing to do, as it is only half an album.guitarist DM obviously sings more on this album, which has not gone down well with most longtime fans. while serj has a greater depth of emotion in his voice, DM's vocal psychosis contributes to the edginess of the band. it has been suggested he shut up most of the time and let serj get on with it.as for lyrical and musical quality, soad are still making strong political statements, which is good. what is not good, in my opinion, is the annoying societal-satirical rap-ranting they are known for. jeeebers, they just sound so.... ...american.i'm sure you could make one good album out of mezmerize and hypnotize. load up your ipods. kia ora."
1,Rage Against the Machine wanna-be,"I Never liked this band nor any nu metal bulls*it that has came out, this album is just dreadful, stupid, idiotic mess, their first album was good, but that's about it, I Hated everything else, to compare this group to RATM is just stupid, this band is just stupid, Lousy and lameo.This is why I Hate the music industry these days."
1,Worst Band Ever,"A few years back one of the brothers from Oasis (the one that is a complete jerk) said that System of a Down was the Worst Band Ever and that he wondered if it was a sign of the apocalypse that a band this bad could be popular. I hate to agree with a jerk, but he has some very valid points on this topic."
2,Failed to Hypnotize,"I've been a SOAD fan for years, ever since I saw the sugar video in 7th grade....I'm now 2 years into college and I have noticed that System has kind of lost it. Mesmerize was a pretty good release, there are a lot of sing along choruses, but there are enough harder songs to keep me listening. Now for Hypnotize....this cd is not top notch SOAD. I realize that over the years they have gotten more and more mainstream. Every song on here sounds like it could be a single, except for, my fav, ""vicinity of Obscenity."" This song is so weird, its the only reasong I'm going to keep this cd. So if you've been living in a hole for the past, almost, 10 years and you haven't heard SOAD, stick with their 1st and Toxicity, you won't be disappointed."
5,Hypnotize is the best album yet! A Must Buy!,I really think that this is their best album yet. I enjoy listing to System of a Down's ever evolving music.
3,"Ah, Well!","My neighbour bought this album last year when it came out. Ever since then, I have not stopped hearing System of A Down blasting in my ears. I wake up at night with Hypnotize in my head! So I guess I wasted a few dollars buying the CD for myself then..Vicinity of Obscenity is one of my favourites. It is hilarious, and intentionally so. My second favourite is She's Like Heroin. However, my liking for the rest of the songs drop from there. The sad songs aren't really sad. Chop Suey was an emotionally packed song. There are none of those on this album. Also, the political propaganda spewed in nearly EVERY song is TIRESOME!Oh yeah, and what's with the guitarist starting to sing now? His voice is high-pitched and whiny, I don't like it. Old SOAD ruled!"
5,Dual disk !!! WOOOOOOOOOO,Ok First of all Excellent cd ... its SOAD you know !Now For the Dual Disk Enhanced Stereo sound !!!ok for the cd its encode in 16 bit 44.1 Khzand Now the Enhanced stereo ??? 16 bit ... 48 KhzWOW ... the music is really Great ... excellent music !!!as for the enhanced sound ! no difference between the cd and dvd !!!dont buy the dual disk buy the cd !!!
3,Rating For DVD,"Since this is the Dualdisc version, I thought I should review the DVD side.Put plainly, its not worth the extra money. If you have a nice home entertainment system and have a great sound system for your DVD player, the enhanced stereo version of the full album on the DVD is nice, but the behind the scenes documentary is stupid, and I was very disappointed, and the videos for _BYOB_ and _Question!_ can be found on TV.If it matters at all, get the regular version for the album art on the disc."
2,Where is my buddy Serj?,"Why is there no growling and deep yells? Why is there a whiny punk voice that seems to always overthrow one of the most interesting voices in music today? Why does one of my favorite bands build you up so much then kind of let you down? This album would have 5 out of 5 except that i all i hear half the time is a punk voice. Serj has one of the most captivating voices i have heard in along time. I don't even like this genre of music at all but system has always hooked me with it's raw sound, and a voice that just pulls you in, i hate punk music and that's what i think of when i hear whiny darron, it just makes me mad that such a great band has to whine so much. But i can't help not to love this cd. It just is a let down."
4,Almost as good as the first....,"If you like a mixture of heavy metal, alternative, and politics, then this is for you.System of a down is a superior band with a unique sound. They tend to be 'left of center' in their lyrics, but they're not pushy like 'rage against the machine' is. Just suggestive lyrics now and then about current issues.I liked Mezmerize better... it had catchier lyrics and just sounded a little better (so I give this 4 stars).Still, they come through once again with their trademark sound, song style, and lyrics. A+"
2,EVERY SONG SEEMS SAME,"I am big fan of SOAD.But after toxicity none of their album was good enough.They need to put varity on their songs.Every song seems same.Toxicity was good because of varity,but this cd on 1 or 2 songs r good.Title song ROkSSS.BUT OTHERS......!!!!Spent ur money on KORN'S new album ""see u on other side""."
1,The garbage truck is coming.. throw this album in there,"I just completely despise this album by System Of A Down. System is good, but this album sucks. I do not like this album, it System's worst ever. I can't belive it was released."
2,Leaves Much to be Desired,"I have to honest and say that this album was disappointing for me, and I love SOAD. Most of the songs were just a bit to over the top for me. Wouldnt recommend unless you like a whole lot of screaming!"
2,Could have been worse. Maybe.,"Wow all i have to say is I miss the old System of a Down. Mezmerize and Hypnotize are two huge let downs. Serj is a great singer but they decide to let Daron add his whiney vocals to the tracks. Back up vocals don't bother me but when he is singing full songs or lends the majority of his vocals on a songs I wan't to cry. With the exception of Lonely Day my favorite song on the album(Daron sings the entire song and it actually isn't that bad, Serj could have made it better though.), Holy Mountain, and Soldiers Side the rest of the songs are just horrible. If Korn's new album is as horrible as Mezmerize or Hypnotize I will completely give up on the Nu-Metal genre."
2,Really Upset,"I have been a System fan for a long time now, and each time an album comes out I fall in love with them more and more. But this album I wasn't so happy with. Suprisingly I feel that mezmerize was much a better CD then this one. I don't feel that this album really represents System of a Down's real sound. I'm also curious as to why the main vocals are being taken over. Serj's unique voice really put the icing on the cake for this band, and I'm not hearing as much of him as I'd like to. Overall, I'd say buy the CD just to support the band, but not for the music on the album."
1,CRAP!!!!!,THIS ALBUM IS GARBAGE!!! JUST LIKE MESMERIZED THEY UTTERLY AND COMPLETELY LET ME DOWN! HOW DO YOU GO FROM A MASTERPIECE LIKE TOXICITY TO CRAP LIKE THIS(...)IT SURE AINT THIS.
1,SOAD Needs to Grow Up,"Hypnotize is just like ever other SOAD album - Pointless songs, with horrible musicianship. If you want to listen to some good music, go pick up a Slipknot album, something by Soilwork, In Flames, Mnemic, Lamb of God, Gizmachi, or Illdisposed."
4,better then mezmerize but not there best cd but its good,1. Attack 4/5 nice fast pace intro2. Dreaming 4/5 great song3. Kill Rock 'N Roll 4/5 im loving it4. Hypnotize -5/5 my fav song on this cd5. Stealing Society 4/5 pretty good song6. Tentative 4/5 now no one is gonna save us7. U-Fig 4/5 goof8. Holy Mountains 4/59. Vicinity of Obscenity 3/5 different disco kinda10. She's Like Heroin 3/5 dont really like the lyrics11. Lonely Day 5/5 great song12. Soldier Side 5/5 great inside look
1,A Mission Statement about nothing,"Before I purchased this article I read both good and bad reviews. One review said ""It won't help you create anything. Save your money! ""I couldn't say it better. Like the Seinfeld show this is a book about nothing!"
1,"No Substance, No Help in Creating a Mission Statement","Be advised that this e-book is 3 and 1/2 pages of large font. Of that, about 3 vague sentences have to do with the construction of a mission statement. This work has no business being titled ""Creating Mission Statements..."" It won't help you create anything. Save your money!"
5,Another e-doc that hits the spot,"My team was able to develop a mission statement that works using this, but better, it really helped everyone involved gain a deeper understanding of our goals through the discussions. I've become a real fan of these short, to the point documents that give enough information to get started on tasks. Sometimes I go on to get a book on the subject because I want to learn more, but as a starter, e-docs can't be beat."
1,Should've done my homework and read more reviews,"The good news - I only wasted a few bucks on this.The bad news - I was fooled into thinking it might really help me create a mission statement.No substance at all, some common platitudes about taking care of your team and reviewing the draft.I seriously cannot believe anyone would rate this 5 stars - I believe there is ""review-stuffing"" going on by this publisher's employees. If they know the default is that Amazon displays the latest two reviews...I would nearly bet money that my review will be pushed down by a couple ""incredible! Gotta have it!"" reviews within a few days of posting."
3,Average,"Coming up with a mission statement is a very in-depth process - so it's kind of hard to adequately deal with this subject in a short paper. If you're looking for something short and sweet, it's worth the three bucks or so. Otherwise I'd suggest checking out some of the books on the same subject."
1,No Substance,"This is ... offering nothing of substance. I found nothing in this booklet that even a novice could find informational. My advice is save your money--unless you need someone to tell you to gather your people in a room, seek input, use a flipchart, and be positive. Amazon[.com] does not offer refunds on e-books...."
1,Light weight drivel,This the most dissappointing article I have read in a long time.It was lightweight and lacked any substance. What should have been the heart of this article (the process of developing a mission statement) was replaced by common sense and cliche passed off as original thought.Do not waste your money.
3,"THE ""LEATHER"" SUCKS!","THEY SAY ITS THINK COWHIDE LEATHER IN THE DESCTION BUT THAT STUFF IS FAKE PLEATHER ITS AS SOFT AS COTTON ITS THICK BUT I CAN CUT IT WITH MY FINGER NAIL ITS REAL FLOOPY AND THE TOP OF THE BAGS SAG DOWN AND DROOP I WISH I WOULD HAVE SPENT THE EXTRA 30 BUCKS AND GOT ME ONE FROM THE BIKE SHOP YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR BUT IT DOES LOOK GOOD ITS TO SOFT A COUPLE OF RAIN STORMS AND IT WILL BE A MESS I RIDE ALL THE TIME I PUT 800 MILES A MONTH ON A BIKE IF YOUR 15 GRAND 15 MILE ""BIKER"" GET THIS IT WILL LAST A LIFE TIME BUT IF YOU RIDE ON A DAILY BASIS GET THE GOOD STUFF"
1,What you see is NOT what you get,"Picture shows a fan labelled ""ball bearing""; description says ""This replacement ball bearing fan"". This fan is plastic on plastic--NO BALL BEARINGS, not even a sleeve bearing."
4,Matt Ward is stylin',"Post-War is a mature work, both musically and lyrically. Ward manages to correct even his most self-indulgent detours by returning faithfully to solid melody lines and interesting content. The production and engineering of this album create a shimmering soundscape. The layered sound never quite submerges the vocals, but it demands careful listening. Not for the lazy. I'm still liking this CD a little more each time I play it."
3,"M. Ward great ""freak folk"" or ""alternative country""","""Chinese Translation"" is an awesome song. If you like Wilco, you'll probably like M. Ward.Matt Zarnstorff"
3,Not half bad.,"An interesting thing happened as I was listening to this album... I found myself enjoying each individual song, but not enjoying the album as an entire piece of work. I think my problem lies within the sameness of the songs. Most of the songs here are played the same way; they have the same rhythm, they have similar melodies and they have similar tones. Now, this may in fact be his point on this album, that society has started to think about war as this everyday thing, just another part of daily life like brushing your teeth, but what M. Ward fails to do is to make the listener think about why that is so. He does an alright job of stating his case, but leaves no room for the listener to give feedback.None of the songs reach a climax, none have heart drenched emotion. It's kind of like listening to a monotone, one note opera singer."
2,Fades from memory quickly,"I really enjoyed this album at first. It was a fun little album. Months later, though, I barely even remember it exists. What was once my favorite song from the album is barely memorable. For those who like the annoyingly popular ""guy and a guitar"" style, maybe this is for you. I'm not into that style, so am bored of this album."
2,can't listen songs to on computer,"Did anyone else try to burn their Post War CD to their computer only to have a crappy video come up for Chinese Translation? It won't even allow me to listen to the songs from the CD on my computer, just watch the dumb video. Please comment if you have the same experience."
5,As Solid as They Come,"Solid can be damning praise for something, but in this sense, I intend it as high praise. POST WAR is not the sort of album that will ""Change your world"", but will reward you everytime you play it. It has a timeless quality, that makes me think I'll still be into it a dozen years down the road. All the songs are of high quality, but MAGIC TRICK, CHINESE TRANSLATION, REQUIEM and ROLLERCOASTER stand out in my book as potential classics. It's not cutting edge, it's just really good, and that's a worthy investment in my book."
3,Same Old M Ward,"M Ward is a songwriter it's almost impossible to hate. He's talented, prolific, has a beautiful voice and conjures a feeling of history and tradition that feels comfortable and warm.Still, every time he comes out with a new album, reviewers fawn over it, remark on perhaps some new instrumentation and proclaim a step forward. I want to like him and do love many of his songs. But I still feel that one M. Ward album is enough. There is not enough different here from Transistor Radio or The Transifiguration of Vincent to leave me completely satisfied with this purchase.But again - who can hate him. The music is pleasant and inoffensive."
2,Lonely Planet Provence & the Cote D'Azur,"This book is obviously aimed at young, hip readers, interested in ""in"" places and night life. I did not find it as helpful for ""senior"" travelers such as I."
4,Useful but LImited,"While this book contains very useful information, it covers only major cities and tourist attractions while ignoring many beautiful villages and towns in the countryside. If your travels extend beyond the usual tourist sites, you'll want to explore other sources as well."
2,Nice and the French Riviera,"Not impressed with this guide book. The authors give a brief synopsis of the travel locations and it is up to the reader to decide if they want to attend. I prefer to read an opinion of a hotel, restaurant, and tourist area rather than read a brief overview. I left my guide book in the hotel."
1,too broad,Our company is already doing much more than ideas mentioned in this article. I was looking for more.
5,best problem skin shampoo,"I've used Maleseb for over 20 years. My current veterinarian didn't stock it so I tried hydrocortizine alternatives for awhile and they were wholly inferior.Maleseb used on a wean down schedule ( bathe 3x weekly for 2 weeks. then 2x weekly for 2 weeks, then 1x weekly forever) is FANTASTIC for controllingdermatitis issues like hot spots, sores, itchy bumpies, etc. This Chlorahexidine product smells good and leaves the coat soft as though conditioned.I LOVE this shampoo and now that I've found it via Amazon again I won't use anything else on my present 2 allergy dogs."
1,Does NOT work.. Company is NOT customer friendly about returns!,"I used this product on my dog for 2 weeks, as directed, and basically threw my money down the toilet. This company will not give refunds, so be careful with your purchase!"
3,It's okay. It covers transmission lines mostly,"I had a class with the professor who wrote this book.The book jumps around ALOT. To understand this topic and book, you have to take a Senior or Graduate level class. The book can't really be understood apart from a knowledgeable professor.The book covers networks, control systems, filters, power, and noise. The topics aren't explained very well. I wouldn't recommend it unless you have to have it for a class."
2,Disappointed in durability,I bought these for my 6 yr old son last fall. A couple of them have already ripped in half and the others aren't far behind. Invest a little more and buy something that will last more than a couple of months - the vinyl doesn't!
4,DOES ITS JOB,The only gripe is it won't fit a 3/8in drill. I had to pay a machine shop to make the shank smaller. Other than that A+
4,Apocalyptic Genre,"Collins examines the apocalyptic genre based on Daniel, the Sibyblline Oracles and the Dead Sea Scrolls. He also examines the connection between apocalyptic and wisdom genres, and the idea that apocalyptic is based upon wisdom, an idea brought forward by G. Von Rad. This book is a must read for any serious student of apocalyptic scripture.[...]"
3,"Same ledger, but thinner pages","I have used these ledgers for a number of years. They are great. So, when I needed two more ledgers, I ordered them from Amazon. They looked just the same, but I discovered that the pages are much thinner than the former ones. You can practically see through the pages. I would think at the price that the manufacturer could use higher quality paper."
2,"kids love it, didn't last long","as I said... I bought three of these at $20.00 a piece plus shipping. I thought the boys I bought it for would love it since it was Mario. They did. Unfortuantely, it lasted not even two hours of ""not to rough play time"". The ""on/off"" button fell off! The boys are nine, we were close by and I know they weren't crashing them. They were racing them and that is it. I was disappointed."
1,Broken out of the box,"This toy is junk, The battery compartment screw was striped, and the on/off switch was broken. It never worked from the get-go."
1,Weak,I brought it and guess what. I made it hit a wall and it shattered everywhere. Even my sister (2yrs) started crying. A definetly a NOT must have.
3,An Historical document,I've been a big fan of Doonesbury for at least 35 years but re-reading the strips was somewhat of a disapointment. Kudos to Trudeau for showing that our Emperors have had no clothes but not very funny to read retrospectively.
4,From a fellow Paladin,"This relatively short book is filled with interesting stories, people and events--not all of which are about physics or science. In fact, this is an enjoyable book for even the most determined liberal arts type who normally might avoid reading about physics. In fact, Dr. Townes seems to approach science and life with a ""liberal arts"" attitude: curious about everything and more than a little adventurous. He challenges readers to look under all the rocks for the excitement and learning to be found there. Read it for enjoyment and edification (a rare combination these days)."
3,Ike Hayes,"Slow and groovy, a pleasure to see and hear. Not as powerful as I thought, but worth the time to experience"
3,A little dissapointing at the end,"I was introduced to Matt Ruff by a friend who insisted that everyone he knew read Fool On A Hill. I did, and discovered that I had read another book from the same man, called Sewer, Gas, and Electric. Both of those books are absoilutely fabulous. Set This House In Order was a good read, and very engrossing, but I think it fell flat at the end. It seemed to me that everything was resolved too easily, and too quickly. The buildup of character development and background story had been fabulous (as expected from Matt Ruff), but the final solution wasn't really that interesting, and when the book ended I felt like I should have stopped 3/4 of the way through instead."
3,"The right elements, but trips on itself","The imagination and control of the author are not to be denied. To keep the reader aware of what's going on from so many different perspectives and voices demands skill.SPOILER ALERTHowever, I agree with many others that the ending doesn't fit the creativity and depth that the rest of the story does. I also feel the book could have been 1/4 to 1/3 as long without getting bogged down in the day to day minutiae of the character's lives that doesn't really add much to the story.Also, if you're sensitive to any sort of emotional, mental, or sexual abuse, this is not the book for you. I almost quit it halfway through because of it. It's not that it's super graphic, it's just that it's difficult to experience 3rd hand at points.Overall the book was very, very interesting, and artfully crafted, but I think the author could have benefited from one or two more edits, cutting down on fluff and completely overhauling the ending."
4,A great read,"I really enjoyed this book! It was such a suspenseful and intense read, I would have thought the author had personal knowledge of D.I.D. himself to be able to create the worlds he does for the main characters. Great twists and interesting in detail, I have already recommended this book to several of my friends. Enjoy!P.S. if, as another poster already stated, you are looking for a ""Sybil"" type story, it really is not contained here- you would need to look for a non-fiction D.I.D. story to get that type of story line. But that does not make this story any less interesting. Anyone with D.I.D. or an interest in that topic will find this book a good compliment to anything they have previously read."
5,This book was worth waiting for!,"Matt Ruff's delightful new novel, Set This House In Order, has been well worth the wait. His brilliant ear for dialogue and great sense of humor carries the reader through a sometimes emotionally harrowing set of circumstances. While the book focuses on multiple personality disorder, the characters are portrayed as fully human, multi-dimensional (sorry!) individuals. Ruff beautifully captures both the humor and the pathos inherent in this sort of disorder. Beyond the characterization, the novel is wonderfully well-plotted, suspenseful and full of twists and turns as we learn more about the lives and the pasts of the main characters. Once I started it, I stayed up all night reading it. Another great work from Matt Ruff."
3,"Don't be fooled, it's not perfect.","Matt Ruff's book Fool on the Hill has gotten lots of indie acclaim, so much so that I was reluctant to read it at first. Needless to say I wouldn't be reviewing this book if the other hadn't made a very good impression on me. It was a wonderful book.This is not that book. This book started off very good. As a matter of a fact, the review you may have read from the person that was halfway through was very close to what I would have written at that point.But then the book had to end. And I just felt that the ending was much much weaker than the book was angling toward.It's still a good read, but it's not anywhere near the brilliance of Fool on the Hill."
3,Great first half,"I agree with the other reviewers who thought that this lost something toward the end. It seemed like Ruff ran out of time on his deadline and wrote the end too fast because up to the half way point, and then some, this book was very enjoyable, unusual, and well written. Plus I learned alot about multiples in the modern world (yes, I read Sybil years ago). It was an exceptionally promising premise, and I must commend him on that. I'm not sorry I read it, but it's not a solid recommendation either. I am, however, tempted to read his other books after reading the other reviews."
5,nothing else like it,This book gives you a great idea of what multiple personality disorder might be like. I can't think of any other books that take you as far inside the mind of someone with a psychological disorder as this one does. I wonder what the professionals make of this effort? Reading it certainly made the whole idea of multiple personality disorder much more tangible for me whereas before it seemed along the lines of a.d.d. or any number of modern conditions that somehow don't seem 'genuine'.
1,The first book I ever threw against the wall,"After reading the rave reviews of this book, I was certain that I would thoroughly enjoy it. I brought it home and dove right in. Now, I'm generally known for reading ANYthing with words, which has become a family joke.Within 3 pages, I was bored, and by 15 pages, I was getting angry. About the time I hit 30 pages, I was so disappointed that I threw the book into the corner of the room, and left it there.I only gave this one star because I don't have the choice to give it less. Apparently I'm the only person who hasn't liked this book one single bit."
1,concern,Wondering why it has the same cover as volume 2.This worries me because I dont wanna buy it with out know if i will get volume 3 and not volume 2.
3,Obviously a Non-OEM battery,This battery is not manufactured by LG and as such does not carry the company's logo. It carries no logo or manufacturer identification at all. Using it will void the LG warranty.The battery projects from the back of the phone by about the thickness of a dime; unlike the original which is flush with the rest of the phone. It doesn't sit firmly onto the cell phone and wobbles quite a bit.After three charge/discharge cycles a full charge will last about three days with very light use. The OEM battery gave me at least five days of use between charges.My overall assessment is that its a cheap battery and you get what you pay for.
2,OK until it shut my phone off randomly,"I purchased this battery as the original was failing. The size is a little larger in width than the original and so doesn't lay flat against the phone. The difference was pretty small, so it didn't bother me.The new battery worked for about a week and had a long battery life. However, after that it would randomly turn my phone off. Once a week at first, then about every 20 minutes.I only paid $5, including shipping, so I don't feel upset that it didn't work out. I also have a feeling a lot of the problem is my phone, which has been beat up and is old."
1,You get what you pay for,"These batteries are cheap knockoffs that gave me quite a few problems. I had ordered three of these batteries: one lost its charge completly in about a month, the second one shuts off the phone every 15 minutes or so consistantly, and the third one shuts the phone off randomly. The main problems are that they don't hold much of a charge and they don't fit on the phone properly. The battery slides a little on the phone and will shut the phone off if contact is lost. The best working battey of the three consistently shuts the phone off when I text since there is a high risk of moving the battery while texting. This is obnoxious because I will get 95% done writing a message and boom, the phone shuts off and I have to turn it back on and retype the entire message. I've learned and bought an offical LG battery. You'll save more money in the end (and be less frustrated) if you shell out the extra $15 for the real deal. I cannot recommend these cheap batteries."
2,Other LG CU500 battery replacement,Just bought this battery. Had very good 1st charge that lasted for 2 days. But only at the 1st charge.
5,Item as described!,"The item arrive in perfect condition. It arrived in a timely fashion. No hitches at all, great to do business with!"
5,Great for dino buffs,I have three kids and there is nothing better then finding a show that they really want to watch that teaches them something. I found that my kids went to the computer to find more facts after they watched the show and really made them question what they know. Thank you for providing this great show.
4,Giving it Look.,Thunder Sticks and Rally Monkies! Yikes! I have to confess I don't recall a lot of this series. I remember the Angels being an exciting young team. The game six comeback sticks in my mind. I remember driving home from New York and listening to it on the radio. I thought for sure the 2002 baseball season was over. I will definetly add this to my collection. It will be great to fill in the blanks.
4,Very cute!,"This is very cute. I think it is a great way to introduce children to counting by ones and counting by tens through manipulatives. And this comes from someone who doesn't like to buy into free advertising (in other words to have cheerio shoved down my child's eyes when I buy the book). But this is a great book.Two thoughts- we have another cheerio book that has the place to put the cheerios as a little hole and my son likes that better. And, although the cover of this book lays flat, the pages do not. I had to put a little crease in the pages back by the spine so they would lay flat. This way my son's cheerios (or fakios) won't slip off the page.Cute book though.Enjoy."
2,Cheerios book,"When I purchased this book for my granddaughter, I thought it was identical to one I had seen at the hospital, where there are actually little slots to put individual Cheerios when the child is counting (then of course they can eat them, 1, 2, 3). The book that arrived had none of those cute little slots to hold the cereal, just the flat page. Of course my granddaughter did not know my intentions, she loved the book anyway."
1,Cannot Rate,"Ordered this for my pup with digestive issues. Product received was not correct and was returned to Amazon. After noticing the UPC numbers matched but picture and descriptions did not, I was afraid to re-order and again receive the wrong item. I therefore have no idea if this product does as it says."
2,My dog did not like it,I tried it putting it in the water for my dog who is a dog that is not picky to eat or drink anything. He would not even drink the water that had this product in it. It doesn't smell bad but the consistency of it is like a syrup. There are other products that I have tried for him that work much better.
4,This Reader allows me to work from multiple computers,"I use this reader with a Transcend 32gb CF card. Whatever computer I am at, I plug this in and I have all my files available. When I started using these, there were no thumb drives of large capacity. Now there is. However if a thumb drive goes bad, you purchase another. I just insert another CF card and warranty the old card, restore from my backup and I am back in business."
4,Good book with lots of information,"I borrowed this book from the library and found it useful enough that I wanted to have my own copy! It is quite dense, so there is a lot of information in the book, which is useful for someone who intends to learn Japanese for quite a while."
4,Good for brushing up on Japanese,"Its been awhile since my last Japanese class in college and I wanted to brush up on things I forgot. Book comes in a logical format, and the accompanying CDs. The book has 40 chapters that deal with typical daily life situations like going to the movies, looking for a job, at the airport etc. The one thing I dislike about this book is the heavy usage of romaji. I feel as a japanese student by the 10th or so chapter you should have mastered hiragana/katakana by then. The text book should focus more on that and adding additional kanji. Otherwise its a good reference and great for reviving Japanese."
2,Slayer saves another disastrous disc,"I'm sorry... I reviewed this CD quite a long time ago and I am ashamed of myself. This CD is a sampler for awful nu-metal bands. Slayer saves the day with ""Stain of Mind"" and ""Chemical Warfare."" Rock and roll is not dead, at least not while The Workhorse Movement has anything to say about it. Nashville Pussy also delivers a good performance, even though their southern rock doesn't really fit in, not that it's a bad thing when so many of the other bands are pathetic. Definitely not worth the money, Workhorse Movement's performance isn't much different from the album version and you can get a much better and, obviously, longer Slayer performance from Decade of Aggression. Avoid avoid avoid avoid."
2,"Good show, bad recording","I went to the tattoo the earth concert and it was one of the best concert that I've ever been to. So I figured the live album would be great right? wrong. First off the recording sounds terrible. Imbetween songs you can hear the second stage band playing which is kind of funny. Also the song choices are pretty bad. They could have chosen a better Slipknot song than Liberate, I mean come on. The bands are great though, just could have been put together better."
2,Technology is Light Years Old,"I laughed out loud when I saw the asking price for this ancient machine. It is light years old and rapidly becoming obsolete. Most new software requires Intel chips. I think my Ipod has more RAM than this machine. Whoever is trying to sell this is delusional. It would make a better paper weight! I would know, I have two powerbooks that have the RAM and HDDs maxed out and they are quickly becoming useless! What a joke."
3,"Solid and well-played, but where's the passion?","I will admit freely that I bought this LP solely for ""Maynard and Waynard"", as I am a huge fan of the late, great Maynard Ferguson. I heard Bergeron with MF several times and was always impressed by his technical prowess - but, as is so often the case with many of the lead trumpet guys around these days, there seems to be too much concern about pristine notes and not enough about genuine emotion in their playing. This record, to me, sounds sterile and overly controlled; it never sounds dangerous or chaotic or even excited. It's a group of very good players, playing very well - but it has no spark, no heart, no risk. I hope Bergeron can learn to loosen up and let go a bit; if he can, the ensuing record might be worth a listen. But, to be honest, I doubt I'll be putting this one on very often."
2,"forget Wayne, go for Malcolm","Sorry, Steve, but if you've heard a trumpet, soaring or otherwise, in a movie or TV show, chances are you are hearing Malcolm McNab, not Wayne Bergeron. The Hollywood cats might call on Wayne...if Malcolm is busy. You want to hear really, I mean REALLY great trumpet playing? [...]"
3,transmitter fails regularly,"I like the product but this is the third time I've purchased one due to failure of the transmitter. It is less expensive to purchase the set than just a replacement transmitter. I have two extra display units now, in case one of those fails! The display fits perfectly in an area where the wife wants it hung. Otherwise I would move on and buy something different."
1,LaCrosse Wireless Weather Station,"Essentially worthless, with no help from La Crosse the maker. Definitely look elsewhere. Item works in fits, and rarely correct."
4,Don't read at night!,"I am new to Karen Rose, this is the second book of hers I have read. I have to admit that at first I was unsure if I wanted to finish this book. The first chapter opened with a sick and twisted crime. So heinous that I actually put this book down and opted for a lighter read. In the ""About the Author"" section of Ms. Rose's book, it says ""she enjoys making other people afraid to go to sleep"", and I will say she did that very well.I came back to this book and although it still creeped-me-out, I enjoyed how strong Tess Ciccotelli remained in the face of such evil when her world was falling apart. I also liked the love story within, the love of the main characters and also of family."
5,Three words... A... Ma.... Zing.... (yes I know it's one word...it's a joke!),"I can't say enough good things about this book. Karen Rose is masterful at telling a story, bringing her characters to life and leaving nothing to chance... period. This story is gripping and very easy to follow. It's entertaining and flows like water. Or maybe like a river of blood!!!!This is a taut thriller with Tess at the center of a mystery bigger than life and death. Why are her patients dying?Karen Rose is new to me, but she is here to stay. She is a writer with a HUGE future still ahead of her... even after the monster success she's already enjoyed. I can't wait to read more of her work!"
4,"Not my favorite, but a fun read","At times a little repetitive, a little slow, sometimes a little cliche...but the mystery behind all those deaths and the complex serial killer Karen Rose gave life too keeps you turning the pages , dying to find out what set all that into motion. Fun read."
4,Couldn't put it down,"I have come to rely on Karen Rose to deliver nasty villains, and twisted plots and I was not disappointed here. I thought I had the killer figured out a few times and I didn't find out until it was revealed in the book, and I was horrified. There was a wonderful mixture of romance, thriller and terror in You Can't Hide. We meet new characters that I am hoping will be getting their own books down the line, Vito, Tess' brother for one, Murphy, Aidan's partner for another. I had a hard time putting this book down and when the killer was revealed, I had so many mixed emotions. Can't wait to see what is in store for me next."
5,I love it!,"I am extremely happy with this purchase. This set is absolutely adorable, and I love the colors and different patterns and textures. It was even cuter in person than in the picture, as you can't see all the little details of the different patterns and textures in the picture. I think it seems to be of very good quality, and I could not be happier with this set!"
5,in love!,"my gosh! i have to admit that i was a little nervous after reading the one bad review about this item, however, i am extremely pleased with my decision to order! its perfect - the pink is perfect - the bear is perfect - the little flowers and butterflies are perfect! - the pink is more of a dusty rose and its a beautiful addition to our daughter's natural colered crib! great quality, soft and fluffy, i just fell in love when i opened the box...its so girly and wonderful..."
2,Quality Doesn't Stand Up to Picture,"I immediately fell in love with the design of this cribset and eagerly awaited its arrival like a child. I was greatly disappointed when I opened the box however. While the design and patterns were very cute, the quality of the materials seemed cheap. There was some embroidery on the quilt and the main bear on the quilt was done well, but the rest of the materials for the set were made with cheap cotton. I was concerned about the wear of the products after washing. Additionally, the bumper was not stuffed firmly, and I was afraid the baby would smoosh her face against it and suffocate. This set was priced less than other sets I had looked at; I guess you do get what you pay for."
4,Great series FINALLY available,"I just wished they had remastered these--this is a classic series that is so motivating and entertaining to teens and enjoyable to watch by adults. The actors do a first rate job. Presented in a family appropriate presentation, unlike the movie. These two seasons need to be A PART OF THE COMPLETE SERIES AND AVAILABLE TO US."
5,NOT Double Sided discs!!!,"I saw above it said Side A and Side B after I bought it and went nuts (can't stand Double-Sided I use Sony MEGA-Changers and don't like having to turn them over it's a PAIN to say the least). But I just opened it and it's only single-sided discs!!! It says on the back ""8 Dual Layer"" & ""1 Single Layer"" so maybe someone took that to be double-sided I don't know. I'm just glad they're sinlge-sided and hope they come out with more seasons! I have the 1st season from before and haven't watched these discs yet but wanted to let everyone know this...(Great surpise) Enjoy... Dave"
4,Phenomenal Book,"This book is simply one of the best I've ever read. As much as some people may malign the Balladeer series for its Christian references, I find the entire series to be better for them, despite my Pagan faith. Wellman uses the folklore of the Appalachians, blended with a bit of his own, to make this book a fascinating read. The Judas Gospel, one of those books that has been rumored to exist for years, is sought after by a wizard who decides to use John to help in his plans to rebuild the world. John has to keep the book from being used, and his efforts lead to a very suspensful novel, despite a general lack of action. If you're looking for gore, You probably don't want to read this book. But if you're looking for some of the best dark fantasy of the 20th Century, then you've come for the right one."
5,Silver John is always worth 5 stars,"Silver John is the best creation of a wonderful writer, Manly Wade Wellman. Yes, it does have some Christian overtones, but it's not the usual Christianity of city folks. This is the real, active Christianity of the Applachians. By turns scary, funny, thought provoking and always entertaining, any Silver John story is worth reading."
3,Good Meal Replacement,"Met-rx makes a good meal replacement powder, especially when it comes to taste and texture. However, I'm not sure if it's the same formula Dr. Connelly invented in the early 90's before he left the company. That old formula seemed to do a better job in bringing muscle-fullness, definition, and vascularity.I used to use two of the old formula Met-rx MRP's to get my bodyfat percentage down from 12% to about 8% in only four to eight weeks. This new formula does not seem to be as effective in doing that. Who knows, maybe it's because I'm getting older, although I maintain the same level of exercise activity and even a better diet than before, and I still hover under 12% bodyfat at 5 feet 7 inches and 150 lbs."
3,Black and White,All the pictures of slides and drawings in this text are in black and white. Most are well-labeled and are veterinary related conditions.
4,Good stuff!,"Good stuff! nice to place in small places or difficult access places, easy to mount in the car & good fidelity.."
3,No Tripod Mount,"I've had the camera for a day now. Quality is what I expected. However, you cannot set it up to record yourself because it has no tripod mount. Bummer. I planned to use it to record some web tutorials."
3,Not comfortable for large hands,"This thing is a bit small for large hands and the controls are not 'finger friendly"". The camera works OK as I didn't intend it to be anything more than just casual use. Battery life is good- will easily go all day with normal use. image quality is acceptable and in most instances good. Sound is weak but that is to be expected with this type of unit. The still camera mode is probably the weakest as it takes a long time to take a picture and at times I can't tell if its in the right mode yet to take a picture. The biggest plus is the overall size and weatherproof-ness. A small camera bag attached to a your belt doesn't feel like an anchor by the end ot the day and will hold the camera,extra SD cards and a battery. For the $ its reasonable as a grab n go."
3,Falls out of your hand,"Overall, while it is certainly provides one with a very small Camcorder we found it quite difficult to hold and operate. The strap and main unit is not very ergonomically designed for a one-hand operation and it is very small to hold with two hands. Software is not very straight forward to make DVDs. Overall, I would not buy if I had manually tested it at a shop."
4,Great camcorder!,Just purchased a couple of weeks ago and have used a couple of times recording grandchild's sports events. Excellent quality video. I am still figuring out how to take the best photos but really got the camera for video purposes anyway. It is so small and compact - very easy to carry in my purse but I got a small carry case so I won't scratch the screen or lens. Easy to connect to my computer to download and burning to DVD. You should order an extra battery to have handy although the one included lasts quite a long time.
2,Reboots Win2K way too often,I have been using this reader for about 6m and it is the only reader that I have that will work with 512MB SD cards. The reader regularly resets my computer. I would not recommend this product for users of Windows 2000.
3,Difficult to Set Up!,"This product uses the ID 192.168.0.1 which is the same as my home hetwork system. Therefore, the ID of the TrendNet product had to be changed. It took two days and four separate levels of technical support to finally get this unit to be recognized by my system. Simply changing the last digit to an unused number did not suffice. It finally became necessary to create a new TCP/IP port in order to access the print server.I believe the instructions should provide a more complete installation information package.This is not a unit that I would recommend for a person who is not very technically competent. It does work okay, however..."
3,It actaully work. but to install is anightmare. you have to be a half geek,"1. you need to have a lot of network guru learning curve2. you must have XP SP3 installed to made it work3. It Work with Vista too but you must learnt to be guru4. If you patient enought to wait 2 minuits between installed steps5. you are reward, it work beautifull after that effort."
5,HP LaserJet 5MP lives on...,"Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) couldn't see the 5MP via AppleTalk, and the HP print servers were discontinued long ago. Read positive reviews of this unit and figured it was worth a shot. Installation using the supplied CD from Windows XP (running in VM Ware Fusion) was a piece of cake, took about 5 minutes. About a minute at each computer in the network switching the default printer to the print server. The native printer drivers on the various Macs in my network (OS 9, 10.4.11, 10.5, and 10.6.2) recognized the 5MP and provided access to all the functionality built into it."
1,Did not work,The software does not allow any editing of the router id from the default. Only experts could get this item to work properly. I would love to have it work as designed but I could not change the default 192.168.1.1 setting for the product. It caused my entire wireless system crash.
1,"Nice look, didn't work so far.","I loved the idea of putting my hp4 laser on network, looks nice, hasn't worked yet. I'm not real happy about it's set up, but am willing to continue to keep trying it. didn't like win7, I have yet to try it on vista or xt....I have a few mac's on my network, I was hoping it would find them and work too/wireless hp4, what could be more perfect if it only worked. Limited instructions, support hasn't gone anywhere, but I still like the idea of turning centronics into wireless printer. thx tom."
1,One way only,"Trendnet TE100-PIP unit was to connect by computer operating with Win XP to a Canon color PIXMA iP4000 printer connecter by home LAN.I had to have Trendnet tech support to get it installed after 2 hours with a new software down load it worked in one direction (printing). I had tried installing it using another computer with win7 with no luck.The unit is very tight fit on the printer.The unit was advertised as by directional, but could not be made to work in my case. I have tried working with Trendnet and they gave up, but suggested contacting Canon for a new driver that supports the TE100-PIP. Canon replied they could not help, but I did re-install the print drive.After installing the unit, I can print from ether compute (Win XP or 7), but the printer ink levels are not available as is the case when the printer is hard wired directly to a computerJo42"
5,"Easy, Easy Easy.",This was basically plug and play. I've used these before and we simply took it out of the box and installed in a minute. Since then it's been working fine.
3,Range leaves something to be desired,"Set up was straightforward and device works well with printer located close to router. However, with printer in another room (the reason I needed the wireless!), it appears the printer doesn't get a strong enough signal to the router. Interestingly, a laptop (g-band wireless) located in the same room as the printer gets Excellent signal quality to the router, so distance from router should not be an issue for the g-band wireless print server.Overseas tech support is decent - at least they don't make you go through steps you've already tried - but bottom line came down to them telling me I would need to move the printer closer to the router to eliminate the sporadic printing problems I'm experiencing.Setup is TRENDnet TEW-P1PG on Lexmark E323 laser, ASUS Dual-Band Wireless-N Router RT-N56U, WinXP laptop with Wireless-G and Win7 laptop with Wireless-N."
1,Don't work,Hooked this up to my laser printer and could not get it to work. Was on the network. Was able to configure it fine. But printed documents just disappeared. I'll be returning mine.
1,Forget it Brother,Upon attempting to connect this device to my Brother Laser Printer's Parallel Port (centronic) I noticed the LPT LED did not light. Ultimately I contacted Trendnet to be told it doesn't work with Brother Printers. Who knows if it works with anything else. Amazon was great concerning the return. I'm sold on Amazon ... not Trendnet. I guess I'm now looking for another way to get a wireless connection to my printer?
1,Didn't work for me.,"Wouldn't work with my Panasonic KX-P4400 Printer. I would consider myself knowledgeable about networks and IP ranges. Wasted hours messing around with the dismally inadequate instructions and web site. Finally gave up frustrated, and returned to Amazon."
1,Bad print server,I just installed this print server on my home network. Originally it worked on my Linux and Windows 7 systems. Now it works on neither. It reports the printer is off-line all the time. When it was printing it was very slow. I have updated the firmware to the latest. The only driver available is several years old and will not even install on my Windows 7 machine.
2,Poor Customer Support,"I wanted to convert an HP LaserJet 4 Plus to a networked printer. Even though instructions from the manual was followed, the printer did not work. The customer support is claimed to be 24/7, but no one has closed my help desk ticket yet. This product cost more than a linksys router. So customers can naturally expect better customer service and better response time."
1,Does not work with many printers,"Be aware that this device does not work with all printers. In fact any printer that relies too heavily upon it's Windows driver will probably be too dumb to work. At least that's my take from this Trendnet Tech Support response:""Please check with the manufacture of your printer and make sure that the printer is not a Host based or a GDI printer.""I'm uncertain what ""host based"" or ""GDI"" mean, except that wikipedia says GDI is a Windows component.In practice it means that my old Xerox Docuprint P8 laser doesn't work with this gadget. Too bad the Trendnet website doesn't offer more clues about which printers work and which don't."
3,I had to cut off some of the plastic cover in order to use it,"Keep in mind that many printers (ie: HP Deskjet 710C and Lexmark Z32) have a plastic ""lip"" or some other such molding on the printer that bulges out near the parallel port. To make matters worse, the designers of this TRENDnet TE100-P1P device used a much bigger plastic covering than was necessary. So the plastic covering near this TRENDnet device's parallel port wants to occupy the same space as the printer's plastic molding near the printer's parallel port. The result: you can't plug this TRENDnet device into your printer... without doing some cutting. I used my Craftsman rotary tool to carefully cut off a portion of the plastic near this TRENDnet device's parallel port (and now I can see some of its circuit board) in order to successfully plug it into the printer. Other than that, this devices works well after my workaround. If you buy this thing, be prepared to do some ""plastic surgery"" on it."
5,Bulbrite Halogen Light,"I bought this 120 volts light bulb at Amazon because it could not be found in local hardware stores.The light is very bright and has glass cover, solidly built. The price is lightly expensive but it is worth the money. I would recommend it."
1,OSHA Offense.,"This thing is the enemy of good posture. I'm 6'1"", and I can't adjust the back to properly align. Worse than that, I can't tell the back not to recline. There's no lock. That's fine for a conference chair or something, but not to work in every day. I assumed they were cheap (I work at a small firm) but when I found out they cost more than an Aeron or Mirra, I just got angry. You'd be better off buying some cheap $150 POS from IKEA than one of these. You'd be sitting in a substandard chair, but you'd have $650 to put towards those chiropractic co-payments."
1,Giddyup!,"My rear hurts, I can't sit up straight, and my arms feel as if they're constantly being forced unnaturally towards my side. These chairs are made cheaply, the arms wobble, the seat mechanism (the absolute bane of my existence) breaks very easily, meaning the seat slides forwards and backwards constantly like a wood saw cutting through your sanity, and the chair persistently wants to recline (ottoman not included). If this chair made a horse winnie it might be funny or charming...but no. Save yourself some money and buy that mechanical bull you've always wanted instead."
5,a great energetic&original start to a long not so great career,this cd was unbelievably heavy at the time of it's release and is still but this re release does little to improve upon this classic at all.buy this cd but not this version except for the bonus track? great cd thou!
5,HARDCORE MY @SS,"HARDCORE IS NONSENSE, WHAT THIS IS, IS AN ALL TIME CLASSIC BALLS TO THE WALL THRASH METAL MASTERPIECE. METAL ON PRO-PAIN"
2,Graphic is OK. The playing experience is like most other 1st person shooter. Not better. Nothing new.,"The Graphic is OK. The playing experience is like most other 1st person shooter. It's not better. There's nothing new, and no excitement."
1,A game with many problems,"I read about this game in Game Informer and it sounded interesting. Unfortunatly this game falls short on many levels. The graphics look good but they are not great, the gameplay is choppy and very sticky. Initially I thought I had spilled some soda or juice on my controller but that's not the problem, the game is just choppy. And this gets irritating really quick.Nothing really special or outstanding about the game, but with a little more fine tuning it could have been great."
4,I like it,"Okay, so this is not the greatest of games but there is something interesting and different about it.The graphics are still pretty good, and the old Xbox I bought plays it without any slowdown. There is plenty of action, and excitement too.The thing I really like about this game, however, is the story. It's a kind of weird sci-fi story, something akin to Dune. The story was good enough to keep me playing, and I can't say the same for many other video games at the moment.If you have the time, and are looking for something with a good story - do check out this rather dated little gem."
4,Fast Paced Highly Changeable Game,This is a fast paced game online and is very adaptable. The Map Editor is easy to use. The sniper quality of this game is not that great. When you zoom it isn't very close but you do have a thermal lense. The game relies alot on quick tactics and long range missle weapons as well as vehicles. You will die quickly and kill quickly. The close range cutting saw is fun if you can get close enough to use it.
3,"Decent game, lacking story, and repetitive fighting","Pariah started out with a lot of promise. The storyline seemed like it was headed towards something great. The weapons and scenery started out unique.However, once I got to the final level, I realized that there was very little storyline. After beating the game, I realized that I wasted several hours of my life.The scenery looks nice at first, but they you realize that there are only 4 different types of scenery that was being constantly recycled.The weapons too seemed very similar and without much change between them. There were basic weapons such as a machine gun, shotgun, and sniper rifle... but nothing truly unique or interesting (especially for being a sci-fi game).One good thing I can say about this game is that it was not too short and not too long. It seemed to be a good balance as far as that goes."
3,It's ok.,"I've only glanced through it but it doesn't look like it's going to tell me anything I didn't already know. Maybe once I read it thoroughly it will be an incentive to finally change my ""life style."" (Euphemism for go on a diet forever)"
5,A great way to look at getting in shape for good,"I have struggled with my weight since having my children in my 30's. I've tried many different plans. If there was a new piece of exercise equipment, I used it. I would lose some weight, only to hit a plateau and stay there. Then I heard about this book and bought it. It was probably the best investment I've made in myself in a long time. Roberta Wennik really put her finger on the problem: one plan is not always right for everyone. So she offers at least four ways for successfully losing weight that never make you feel like you've gone on a diet. Not only that, when you've finished reading this book, you'll have all the tools to live a healthier life. Look at buying this book as an investment in yourself."
4,Nice desk pen!,"This is a large pen, and while I like a little heft and a larger barrel, this one is too big for a wallet or to carry around. Makes a nice desk pen though!."
1,False advertising!,The write up on this light is false. It is not a touchlamp and wasn't even the brand listed on Amazon's website. I returned it!
2,It isn't the same uplight lamp with touch capability.,I purchased this lamp model a few years ago and it was a Touch lamp with THREE options for brightness. This one is NOT that same old lamp...I had to return it
2,UPLIGHT LAMP,"I WAS LOOKING FOR A TOUCH LIGHT LAMP AND WHEN I FOUND THIS ONE (WHICH SAID IT WAS A TOUCH LIGHT), I WAS THRILLED. IT WAS EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE I HAD WHICH HAD FINALLY DIED FROM MUCH USE. I HAD IT OVER 10 YRS. BUT SADLY, WHEN THE NEW LAMP ARRIVED, IT WASN'T A TOUCH LIGHT AT ALL. I KEPT IT BECAUSE IT WAS THE RIGHT SIZE AND SHAPE FOR WHERE I WANTED TO PLACE IT. BUT I'M STILL LOOKING FOR A TOUCH LIGHT WHERE ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TOUCH THE METAL PART AND THE LAMP LIGHTS UP."
2,Beautiful Lamp but Didn't Last Very Long,"I bought this lamp at a local Target Store, and I loved it.However, it only lasted about 60 days, as it just quit working.... I tried different bulbs and outlets, with no positive results. It is gorgeous, but mine didn't last very long...."
2,Blown Bulb = Blown Touch Circuit,"Between Target in-store and Amazon, I have purchased three of these lamps. All three have suffered the same fate--when the bulb blows, the touch circuit fails. I have no idea why, and from reading these reviews, it appears I am in the minority (or most folks do not check back in). Because I like the look, part of me wants to buy another. However, I don't think I can justify repeatedly purchasing a lamp that fails like this. Am I the only one?"
5,Great Lamp!,"We bought one of these for our summer cottage, and liked it so much we bought two more! It turns on and up (it's a 3-way) with a touch on the base, and gives a fair amount of light considering one's limited to a 60 watt bulb. It would be fantastic if it could be re-engineered to use a 150 watt."
2,You get what you pay for,"Beautiful lamp and at a fantastic price...too bad it only works right when it wants to. It sometimes comes right on, other times its almost as if I have to find that 1 centimeter touch zone in order for it to come on. Like I said, I guess you get what you pay for!"
2,NOT a Touch Sensitive Lamp,"The lamp looks great, but it is NOT a touch lamp. Even on the shipping package it stated NON touch."
1,Not A Touch Lamp,"Despite the description, this is NOT a touch lamp. There is a switch and it offers only one level of brightness."
1,WORST LAMP EVER,"I thought this lamp was cool at first but I HATE IT NOW!It randomly turns off, randomly turns on, randomly starts blinking and flashing like it's goal is to give me seizure. I HATE IT! DON""T GET THIS LAMP!"
1,Mind of its own,"I loved the look of this lamp. I bought it for my office and it looked great for about 5 minutes. Then, it just started turning itself on and off. It would go from dim, to bright, to brighter, to off, then repeat this sequence - without me touching it. I tried different bulbs and different outlets. From reading other reviews, it looks like others have experienced the same thing. To bad, because it lights up a corner very nicely."
3,Not a Touch Lamp!,"This lamp has the typical in-line switch. If you do a search for ""touch lamp,' this one comes up, and the description says its switch type is ""touch sensor,"" but that's false!"
1,Amazon is slipping!,"This is NOT a touch lamp, though product description says so. Read the most recent reviews. Of about 17 or so reviews since May 24, 2010, as many as 15 says this lamp is NOT a touch lamp! Nevertheless, Amazon.com keeps selling it as a touch lamp! I've been a satisfied Amazon.com buyer for many years, but this is the first time I have encountered something as bad as this.It is a pretty lamp, and is probably worth the price if you don't mind turning it on and off using the conventional switch on the cord. But look for something else if you want a touch lamp. I have returned it for a refund."
2,Spooky!,"I loved the soft glow, three levels of lighting and touch off/on feature of this lamp. But I bought two of them and they both flickered to the highest level of light without me touching them. I was trying to sleep with the low light on and finally had to turn the lamp off. Felt like my bedroom was haunted! Anybody else have this problem?"
2,NO dimmer NO touch switch.,"Just a plain old in-line roller switch.nice fit and finish tho', so I kept'em."
1,FIRE HAZARD,"These lamps get hot. I mean HOT..the minute you put the bulb in. Too bad because I really liked the look and the touch lamp feature, but they are dangerous."
3,"Nice for the price, but a couple flaws","This is a very cute lamp, and the low profile works nicely in the bedroom, where I also appreciate the diffused quality of the light. One small aesthetic issue: with the white glass and nickel-colored base, why on earth did they put a black power cord on it? Because I have it on a built-in shelf, it can't be hidden at the back, so it's kind of clunky looking. As for functioning: when I tried to use a compact fluorescent bulb, it wouldn't turn off completely! It just flickers and then starts to strobe, but never goes off. As it happens, I also had a 3-way bulb in an old lamp, and that works just fine. Which is a shame, since I've been trying to use more CFLs. But since it will only be used for pretty short periods of time, and not even every day, I've decided to keep it."
3,"Good value product, dissappointing asthetics","Loved the touch base mechanism on this lamp. Cannot ever go back to awkward switches. Really great for anyone with dexterity problems. Gives excellent amount of light for reading in bed, and is unobtrusive. Was a little disappointed with the asthetic appearance which is broad and wide, like a bowl. Recently got a similar set of lamps with colored shade, slightly smaller lamp and curved appearance to glass. One reviewer reported that lamp overheats. I almost didn't order it for that reason. I have not found this to be the case."
2,Kinda missed that on/off switch...,"Bought this at a local Target store, got it home, popped in a bulb & plugged it in. Light came on. Touched the base. Nothing. Tapped the base. Still nothing. Pounded on the base. The thing would not turn off! Unplugged the lamp, popped out the bulb, packaged it back up & returned it to the local Target store. Think my next lamp will have ye olde reliable on/off switch as in days of yore..."
1,Don't buy this lamp,"I bought this lamp at Home Depot and after using it a couple of days the ""turn off"" feature stopped working (it is supposed to turn on/off by touching the metal base). The only way to turn it on or off now is with a wall switch.Beware!"
4,Uplight Lamp,"I love this lamp. The touch sensor is so convenient. It gives a room the perfect ambience.Two downsides:A previous customer was right about the energy efficient light bulbs not working too well with this lamp. Also, both of my lamps have large cracks (as if it had been dropped on wood or tiled floor) in the actual ""crackle glass"" shade. Obviously the crackle glass is part of the lamp, but the large noticeable crack is not. It hasn't affected the quality of the lamps, but it is a slight annoyance."
2,I Love This Lamp,"The first time I bought this lamp I wrote: ""This lamp is even prettier than it looks in the photo. It is so easy to touch it on & off. I am really enjoying it.""I liked it so much that I ordered another when the first one stopped working. The second lamp was not a ""touch"" lamp as stated, nor did it have the three levels of light it was supposed to have. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!"
5,"Form, function, and a low price too!","I was looking for a lamp to put in a dark corner of my newly redecorated living room. This lamp is perfect in every way! Great looks, convenient touch-lamp technology, the three way bulb is great if you want to set any mood in the room. If you're thinking of ordering this lamp, I encourage you to do so...two thumbs up...WAY UP."
2,Very nice bedside lamp! (Updated 1/12/10),"I have always used touch lamps by my bed for the ease of turning on/off the light before falling asleep and getting up in the middle of the night. The only problem I had with regular touch lamps is that on the occasions I fell asleep with the light on, the brightness from under the lamp would glare in my eyes when turning at night and wake me. This little uplight is perfect! There is no bright glare shining down. And it uses a regular light bulb, so it can be bright enough to light up the room or read with, yet the dim light is low enough for ambiance. It has a very nice appearance and was even larger than I expected it to be (to my liking).Very nice product!EDIT: This lamp stopped working about two months ago. I thought it was a bad light bulb so tried a few new ones. No success. Dropped 5 stars to 2 stars for short useful life. I think a year and a half is a little to short for a lamp. :( Too bad cuz it's such a pretty one."
4,Very nice touch lamp,"After my last, rather ugly, touch lamp was destroyed by my child, I have been looking for a new one. We got this one and liked it enough to buy a second one. Reliably responds to contact. The 3 levels of brightness work with a regular old light bulb. Was in perfect condition when received."
1,False advertising!,"""Features a touch-sensitive 3-way brightness and on/off switch. Just touch the base to brighten the room or turn the lamp off. Uses one 60 watt standard bulb (not included). "" Not true!!! I ordered this to go with another crackle glass shade TOUCH lamp that looks identical to this in the photo. However, this one arrived today and it has an on-off switch on the cord and absolutely no touch function to the base. I am extremely disappointed. I should have believed other reviewers who said it wasn't a touch lamp. I figured they'd ordered the wrong thing. So now if I return it, will I get the exact same thing as the exchange? Sigh... Not happy with Target right now."
2,not a touch lamp,About 5 years ago I purchased a lamp at Target that was a touch lamp and looked just like this product. I even did a search for touch lamp and this product was selected. When it arrived it looked just like my old lamp but this one was not a touch. Still looks nice but not what I was looking for.
2,It is not touch lamp!,"This lamp looks awesome but it is not touch one. This is the main reason why I ordered it and now I was deceived by product description. (later on I saw other similar reviews that is not touch)I gave it 2 stars only because it looks nice and modern. Another con is that if it stays on a night stand, which is lower and you pass by the light, will shot straight in your eyes (with a 60W light bulb is not fun).Just asked for refund so I will order a real touch lamp."
1,not as advertised,"These were stated to be touch lamps, and that is exactly what my mother wanted. I bought 2 of them to be bedside lamps for my mother. When I received them, they were beautiful, but NOT touch lamps. You had to turn them on and off with an inline switch, which made them difficult to use, not the touch lamp that I planned for my elderly mother."
1,This is not a touch lamp!,"I ordered this lamp to replace one that broke. I ordered it specifically because it says it is a touch lamp. What I was sent is the exact same thing I had in my hand at the Target store. It has a switch in the cord, and is *not* a touch lamp! The packing slip even says ""non touch""."
2,Not as described.,This lamp was described as having an on and off touch on the lamp. This is not so.
5,Great Lamp,"My husband found this lamp at one of the stores and they were out of stock, that was almost a year ago. I finally bought 2 of them a couple of weeks ago and they were well worth the wait. Perfect for reading and also perfect for a romantic atmosphere. I sugguest a 40 watt bulb, no higher, the 60 watt was way too bright even on the first setting.Fantastic Buy!"
5,Totally awesome!!,"This lamp is so versatlie and easy to use. It comes in handy with kids who are afraid of the dark, but also works well for adults. I love it because if you have to get up in the middle of the night for whatever reason you don't shock your eyes like you would with the stark lighting of a regular lamp. And it's nice and heavy, so it won't break easily with usage. The only problem is that it sells out so quickly. This is the only place that I am able to get notification of when it's in. The next time it's in I'm ordering two more."
1,Don't bother if you've updated to XP SP3,"This sound card is not compatible with XP's SP3 update. I bought it today at BestBuy and after an hour of trying to uninstall/reinstall things, I finally called Dynex who informed me that it's incompatible with the SP3 update."
4,Spicing up the marriage gets out of hand,"I was very suprised that this wasn't reviewed - so here goes. Husband and wife decide to make their marriage more interesting so they decide to let her seduce various plumbers, delivery men, etc to the point of well, insertion, then hubby comes in acting like the outraged spouse and scares them off, leading to laughs and hot sex thereafter. Then one day, a rich stranger takes her bait and doesn't scare off so easily. Love triangle ensues. Sara Suzanne Brown's body is perfect, REALLY FLAWLESS and her scenes with hubby, stranger, strangers' 2 hot girlfriends, hubby's co-worker, etc etc etc are pretty well done as well. Worth the viewing if only for her smoking hot body."
4,"A ""real"" tale on China","Every chapter tells us a different story of individuals, as they spent or lost their lives during the 10 years of Cultural Revolution in China.The stories brought to us from Feng Jicai are really upsetting, showing another time that reality could overtake our all immaginations. He break the ""silk veil"" on the real stories happened during the Cultural Revolution and give us a real insight on why the current Chinese culture and people's behaviour has been so greatly affected by that period.If you really want to know more about China, beside the economic development datas and political commentaries, read it.Just a remark: I did not give it a five-star rating (the content deserves it all) because the translation to English is sometimes ""imaginative"" (well, in a sense that makes it more Chinese, sounds like some pages of China Daily)"
3,"Interesting Idea, but the execution is spotty","These are stories collected from interviews the author did with survivors of the Cultural revolution. However, the author is not interested in the tribulation and redemption stoirs commonly published (E.g. Life and Death in Shanghai,Red Azalea). Instead it is more a catalogue of the bizarre, with the author selecting stories that he found uniqe and interesting. Sometimes I also thought that the stories were interesting, but there were several stories where I could not really see the point. The author also inserts a line at the end of each story, I guess to explain each one, but they did not translate well into English and were an annoying distraction."
1,I didn't like it,I was very disappointed in this book. The pictures were very simplistic and there are no words.
1,POOR PRINT QUALITY RUINS THE WAIT,"I waited in expectation in Australia for the arrival of my first copy of Dial M for Murder. I was still happy when I saw the covers, but then I opened the book and I saw the very variable print quality inside those covers. Some pages were good / OK and others were VERY FAINT.I'm not sure how to get a good copy from the vendor with consistent print quality throughout. Do vendors, such as the Dramatists Play Service Inc.that supplied this bok to me, read these reviews?"
4,Thank you,"Even after all the mail confusion, Amazon did the best job they could to get it to me fast. thanks."
1,Someone at warners needs a new job,"I'm tired of characters who we have grown up with being changed for themodern tween Like ""The Batman"". As someone who has invested alot in Scooby Dvds, Warner will never see a dime of my money for this garbage. I'm tired of the influence and or take over of Anima to our American characters."
1,Dreadful,"My children (ages 4 and 6) and I were excited when we found this at the library, but we couldn't get through the first episode, which was: boring; ill-executed; lacking Daphne, Velma and Fred. Try outA Pup Named Scooby-Doo: Complete 1st Season, the original series or even the newest versionWhat's New, Scooby-Doo? - The Complete First Season, all of which are far better."
1,And I thought that it couldn't get worse than Scrappy,"There is nothing good to say about this show. I had hoped that the makers of Scooby would have learned from their Scrappy fiasco. But, this show makes one look fondly on Scrappy. Any time that ""the gang"" is not really in a show, look out.Even the art in this show is bad. Frankly, it isn't Scooby. Looks nothing like Scooby. Music doesn't sound like Scooby. Dialog is not Scooby. Everything that makes the Scooby shows great is sadly missing in this show."
4,My Boys Liked This...,"My boys, 4 & 6, really thought this DVD was hilarious. They were giggling and rewinding to see some scenes over and over again. They cannot wait for the next DVD with Scooby & Shaggy. My 9 year old thinks it's funny, but not that funny, which is why I gave it 4 stars."
4,HILARIOUS Cartoon Fun...,"My boys love this show. I think it is one of the best on Saturday mornings right now. Dr. Phibes is HILARIOUS!!! My boys laughed for days when he got the giant wedgie! It is all just good fun and a lot of humour. We give it 4 stars. Not the original, but who cares? Enjoy it with your kids, you won't be sorry!"
1,horrible!,"Do not waste your money on this. It's like throwing money in a trashcan. Worst Scooby Doo knockoff by far. I have a bonus episode of this on my laff-a-lympics volume 1 dvd. I tried to watch it, but I could only watch 5 minutes of it. This is a warning, don't buy. If you are looking for something good try Scooby doo/dynomutt hour"
1,Stay Away,"What's striking about this book is not only how bad and predictable the plot was, but how weird the actual book looked. There was no dedication or publisher's pages in the front, no foreward, no epilogue...nada. I don't know who the Writers Club Press is (a printing press in the author's basement perhaps?) but for $15 couldn't they give it the look-and-feel of a real book?Stay away or get it used...Amazon is hawking '25 used and new from $1.61' which sounds about right."
4,Not original versions on most but worth listening to,The first time we listened to the three disks Frankie Laine's voice sounded strange to us because most aren't what we were used to listening to. We were still happy with the choice. After listening to them a second time we enjoyed them even more and noticed the differences less and less. We're happy we purchased them to have all his great old songs.
2,Not a good resource for specific workouts,"I'm not sure what the others were reading but I thought this was a waste of my money. The book is huge- much bigger than I expected- but I was looking for some specific workout programs and it falls way short on that. It claims to have a 12-week program but I've thumbed through several times and can only find 3 weeks worth. Perhaps I have to dive into it more but I find it confusing to find what you're looking for and unorganized. If you're looking more for information about working out, diets, etc. then maybe it's for you."
2,Ugh,This book gone big slimy MAN HANDS. Grasp a grape with meat inside double yodiiggity GIM BONNA MONA!
4,A Good Book For The Beginner,This is a very good book for the beginning bodybuilder and/or someone trying to get back into shape. It has all the exercise routines and diets to start off with. I have been pushing steel regularly for 3 years and this book had some good info. I'm not into training the total body in one workout but it will help beginners.
3,"Good book, but some spaces to be desired","The style of this book manifests a platter of techs--divided into intro, intermediate and advanced. It also includes the food plan tailored to weightlifters' interests--this is a great plus. However, lack of cross-refernces for numerous exercises tarnishes this book from being a handy refernce. If you have been a gym rat while suffering stagnant progress becuase of your diet, this book is a best fit."
2,Great for a beginner,"I workout all the time and I am constantly buying new health books and comparing them to each other and adding what i read and learn to my workout routine. This book is great for someone who has not picked up a weight in their life. For someone who is intermediate or advanced its not worth the money. Yet i bought it anyway just to have in my collection. If you really wanted to get serious about it I recommend ""arnolds encyclopedia of bodybuilding"" it is by far the best boook for adding muscle and trimming down. (be advised Arnolds book is for those who really want the info to buff up)"
2,Maybe good starter book...maybe,"I thought this book was not really written that well. The ""opinions"" of editors and other writers/fitness gurus are plentiful in this book but there is not enough real explanation of the science or biology behind it. Sporadically, there are one or two sentence quotes from Ph. D. but there is not enough content to give the book real credibility. Too much blah bah'ing and not enough meat.For me... Just give me the low down, (backed by real current science) not a lot of anecdotes and analogies about cars and such."
4,Awesome Program and Reference Guide,"I've tried several programs and routines, and those outlined in this book are the best I've seen. The illustrations are clear; the reason I gave 4 stars is because a few of the lifting routines are wrong and could be injurious.The diet section is well done, and quite up to date. The recipes are average at best, however the general dietary guidelines are helpful.Light years better than Bill Phillips, the lifting routines are tough, concentrated, and effective. The alternate workouts hit every major muscle group 2x a week, and target specific muscles in approproate volume and frequency. I recommend without qualification the purchase of this book, especially for those who are relatively new (0-2 years) to bodybuilding."
4,Oldie but Goodie,"Is definitely a bit outdated now, but was the first book I really followed when I seriously began working out. I really bought it for the nostalgia, but I did see fantastic results by taking the information it provides and creating a work routine and nutrition regiment. If you are just getting started with working out I would highly recommend this book. A huge selection of exercises and nutrition options. I suggest taking the information and tailoring it to what works for you and what you want to do (gain size, definition, etc.)"
4,Enlightening,"I've been working out on and off for many years, since I was in high school, and I've always followed the plan that I pieced together back in my days of working out with friends in this garage or that garage. This book dispelled many of the myths that I grew to believe and provided informed scientific information that I can quickly and readily apply. I've completely revised my routine based on this new information. I also like the fact that the book is aimed at regular guys, i.e., not would-be and/or professional body builders. I'm glad I bought it."
1,1600-WHAT A JOKE!,"I scored a 1500 BEFORE I read this book and when I learned the erroneous methods and tips and other material in this book, I scored an 1100! A 400 point drop! This book is a disaster --Don't buy it. My friends also had the same problem - they also decreased their score using this book. Don't they check to see the accuracy of what is written?"
4,"Great Player, But............................................","Great Player. Very versatile. Sound quality is very good. On occassion, the player will freeze up trying to load a song. Seems to be due to a bad file, but the only way to reboot is to either let the battery run down or plug it into the computer. If you are away from the computer, the player is useless. Customer service is non existant and the owners manual is of very little use. The player deserves 5 stars, but lack of customer service and a poor owner's manual drops the rating. I still would recommend the player. It plays for a long time on a charge."
4,"Great DAP, a few small issues","I got the 30GB version about a week ago. This is the first hard-disk based DAP I've owned (I've had a few flash-based ones). This is a great DAP. The construction seems solid and durable. It's easy to use, I installed the software and got everything running without reading any manuals or anything. The sound quality is excellent.There are a couple glitches, though:1. I'm overly picky about sound quality, so I initially loaded some loss-less WMA files onto it, but these wouldn't play. After some tinkering, it seemed like it wouldn't play WMA or MP3 files with bitrates greater than 256K. But the sound quality with that bit rate is great, so this isn't a big deal.2. It doesn't have completely gapless transitions from track to track. If you listen to anything where a tracks lead into the next track, this is quite noticable.3. The cord on the including headphones is rather short."
5,Best MP3 Player Ever,Loved this thing. But it's only for the type of person who has a lot of music that he/she wants to carry around all the time. I loved this product so much that I forced myself to come on here and write a good review. I've had to it for a long time without any problems. Only after 5 years did it get a hardware problem. Download Rockbox firmware to get even more out of this machine. The people who rated this player bad are computer illiterates who blamed their own misinformation on the player.
2,XP Boot Up Hates It,"My fairly plain vanilla XP Home Dell PC goes through all kinds of hiccups trying to bootup with the ImageMate plugged in from the start. It's a completely different story for bootups with the Image Mate unplugged. Those XP bootups work perfectly.The Image Mate works as expected when you plug it in after your XP boots up. XP wants you to properly dismount it via your lower right tool bar after you are finished using the device.One interesting thing that I learned when I hooked up the ImageMate, according to XP, was that my Dell 4400 (a fairly recent fast PC) didn't come with a USB 2.0 hardware interface installed. XP told me that my device would work anyway, but at a lower speed. That lower speed is plenty fast enough for me."
4,good dvd,how can you have a dvd where the title character loses all but 2 matches on it. great matches though.
2,Pretty bad,"I watched this because I love Barbara Mori, who is fine in this movie but not given much of an interesting part. Most of it follows De La Torre as he mopes and moons over Mori's character and tries to conquistarla although she's entirely not interested. Rather than coming off as sweet or funny, De La Torre just seems dorky (even more so than the suave ""nerd"" best friend, who is just skinny), annoying, and pathetic (and not that good-looking, although his character is supposed to be all that). None of his stunts to try to win her over are all that outrageous or comical either. In the ending, which defies believability, some cheap psychological mumbo-jumbo is supposed to win the girl over, although what she really ought to do is file a restraining order."
3,very telenovela like,"I found this movie rather charming. It is a somewhat telenovela (aka soaps) inspired movie. The actors are known for the roles in hispanic telenovelas. The story and the dialogue was cute. As cheesy romantic comedies go, this was ok. The actors are not very believable, but it actually seems that the movie was going for the cheesy side over-the-top romantic side of things. It is entertaining and I liked it. So don't have any high expectations and know that this is a mexican telenovela-like movie."
4,Fullscreen Format ??,"This is a sweet little movie and I enjoyed it very much. That said, be warned that this DVD is not in it's original theatrical aspect ratio but in fullscreen format. The 16:9 ratio indicated on the disc is a misprint. This is not pan-and-scanned but apparently an open-matte version of the movie - not as bad as a pan-and-scan but still not the original aspect ratio which would have fit in nicely on a 16:9 TV."
2,What a Waste!,"Beware! Watching this DVD will be a big waste of your time, unless, of course, you enjoy inane screenplays. Not even Barbara Mori's good looks can redeem this turkey, which barely deserves 2 stars. Que plomo!"
4,Really Funny!,"Alright, well I thought this movie was really funny. I don't like chick flicks and this was def not one. The main character's friends are hillarious; really life-like...as in they would be any guy's best friends. They are always making fun of the main character and setting him up with horrible, annoying women. The movie was quite entertaining and not a waste of time. Watch it if you want to see a light comedy/romance movie. It's great!"
1,mediocre at best...,"more so called ""punk"" from poser chuck burns. this is mediocre at best. i'll stick to my exploited and gbh thank you."
2,Nothing more than good looks,Not very happy with this pen... it does look great but not very functional. The writing is movement in wobbly and imprecise. I've only had this pen for a few weeks and dropped it once (which is a very common occurrence with pens!) and since then it's become hard to twist the pen on and off.
5,Another fine job.,"This album is a drastic departure for David Longstreth, while remaining essentially the same. The album is split into two sections. The first 7 tracks are David working with a ten-piece chamber group called The Orchestral Society for the Preservation of the Orchestra. His distinctive warble works well against the beautiful orchestral arrangements, most notably in ""(Throw on the) Hazard Lights"". The latter portion of the cd is composed of sparse acoustic numbers, with few exceptions (e.g. ""Weather I'm Under). Overall this cd is much more laid back than it's predecessor, but this does not imply lack of quality at all. Overall this is a wonderful album worthwhile of a listen, and most certainly a purchase."
5,Great Return to the P.R. Sound by Victor,"After four successful albums with Sergio George's signature urban NY sound, Victor Manuelle returned to a more PR sound with this album. All the songs are great, could do without the last song. One annoying element is the back up singer's sound on ""Asi Fue"". It is also heard on other songs from the past albums."
3,Not a bad movie!,"I picked this up because the only film I had seen featuring luscious Allison Hayes was Attack of the 50 ft. woman. Lust To Kill is surprisingly enjoyable. A standard low budget western with a tried and true plot that was already old hat when it was made. (two old friends who end up on different sides of the law) No big stars, but familiar faces for the time with Tough-guy Don Megowan and the capable Jim Davis of Dallas fame. Miss Hayes is easy on the eyes and exhibits a hard as a diamond female toughness much like Jane Russell. Well worth watching. The video transfer is fine and sound quality excellent."
3,LUST TO KILL,THIS MOVIE IS A BIT OLD BUT I WAS A FAN OF ALLISON HAYES SHE WAS GOOD IN THAT ERA OF TIMEAND THE STORY WAS FAIRLY GOOD I HAVE SEEN WORSE MOVIESMALCOLMEVANS6@HOTMAIL.COM
4,The Gunslinger meets Spaghetti Westerns,"Six Reasons Why is a Western/Fantasy amalgamation, which you could easily call a cross between Stephen King's The Gunslinger, and the spaghetti western, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. On many levels, this movie thrives and succeeds. The cinematography is brilliant for such a low budget flick, and the story telling is paced well. There are no lulls or dead spots, and no unnecessary scenes or dialogue. It is this bare bones story telling style that holds your attention, and ultimately carries Six Reasons Why into the realm of a memorable film. The one thing holding this film back from reaching its potential is acting. While the acting is often very serviceable, it often wavers on the over-dramatic side, and occasionally, albeit infrequently, crumbles into mediocrity. If you like King's Gunslinger, or are a fan of spaghetti westerns, Six Reasons Why is worth viewing."
1,Six Reasons Why is a waste of time and money.,"Six Reasons Why is a waste of time.I could not get into the story, and the actors are amateurs (except for Colm Feore).The movie is being touted as an example of indie filmmaking in the tradition of the Coen brothers.The Coen brothers put out quality product from the start.Save your time and money for something worthwhile."
1,Seemed like it was filmed in slow motion,"This was the slowest most drawn out movie I've ever seen. The story is about a wandering desperado who, while riding a horse and carrying a six gun, is really living in the future. He's been given a quest by a preacher which is the hint that he's suppose to be a good guy out to get the bad guys in the bad lands. There wasn't any twist to that in mind. The film never grips you and the best thing that I can say is that since I rented this, I could turn it off without having to leave my seat. The acting is poor and the filming gives this movie more of an amateur feel than a indie film. If you want to do yourself a favor, skip this movie and rent a sleeper like In Bruges."
1,Non-Stop ABBA Dance Mix,"Nothing like I thought is would be. Didn't realize it was by the ""Dance Machine"" who should look for a different profession."
2,meh,"the shirt is definitely great mossy oak and it is deinfitly made of out common cotton like materials. however the sizing is SOOOOO far off its almost like whatttt??? I mean i guess you get what you pay for. but I am 5'6"" stocky and mediums fit me extremely well in nearly every single shirt/suit/jacket company and this shirt came in a foot longer then my torso and skin tight."
2,Sizing,I ordered an XL as a Christmas present and it was way too small. My stepdad did not even think it was correctly sized. If ordering go one to two sizes up
4,Pretty good product,"This shirt Runs a little big, but when dried it shrinks to almost the right size. I would recommend this product ."
5,Great Shirt,This tee is great nice weight and pattern.Correct Sizing! Shipper was very prompt in filling the order. Great Product! Thanks!
2,not to crazy about this shirt,"i ordered a small size and what i got was huge, and the material was very think. but was no problem to return and get my money back."
4,Not bad,"Not bad for under $10. I got a 2XL and probably could have got an XL, it's kinda big. They got these at Walmart for $7 or less near the fishing section."
1,Rolf's Nostalgia Clutch,This clutch did not last three weeks before that closing latch broke. Very poor quality. Not worth the money. They did give me a full refund .
4,"absolutely beautiful boot, BUT.....","This leather boot is absolutely gorgeous. There was only one problem, which I had corrected at an expert shoe repair. The calf was ENORMOUS! I am skinny, but come on! The fit on my foot was perfect, but I had to have the calf taken in almost two inches at the top of the calf. Luckily, I got the boots on sale and with the cost to get them fitted, I basically got them for regular price, but I AM VERY HAPPY NOW WITH THESE BOOTS. They are beautiful."
4,Trumpet Mute Bag is Fine,"This trumpet mute bag is very nice. It is spacious inside and very soft to protect the mutes. If there were some kind of retention system to keep multiple mutes from bumping into each other, I would say it was perfect. I just worry about having the metal and other mutes with cork bumping against each other and this could be solved with some elastic band divisions inside the bag to separate them."
4,Mute Bag Does its Stuff!,"My son owns many mutes, and I wasn't sure this bag would carry them all without jamming them in. But, it turns out I was wrong. The bag is well sized, holds the mutes he uses, and is of good quality. All-in-all, a good purchase!"
5,A Scream Away From Happiness,"In a society that punishes us for the expression of our emotion and rewards us for role-playing and lack of conviction, millions of Americans have found it dangerous to acknowledge their true feelings. The result has been a vast emotional turn-off that leaves many people totally unaware that deep feelings of anger, fear, and pain exist in them at all.A Scream Away From Happiness is about a kind of ""scream therapy"" that goes rapidly beyond the symptoms of disorder to the feelings, attitudes, and behavior of today's emotionally frozen man. In scream therapy, people can touch and embrace and confront one another honestly - something they cannot do in most instances in our culture.A Scream Away From Happiness presents the groups, the marathons, and the people that make them. It discusses what is wrong with Americans today and why traditional analysis often fails. It is, finally, a plea for greater honesty to the self and to others.--- from book's back cover"
3,I guess I have more than a large head,"I purchased these to go with a waterproof iPod and waterproof headphones so I could combat boredom while swimming at the gym. I read a number of reviews that complained that if water leaks into the earplugs you lose the sound. This seemed like a good way to keep the earplugs in.But it is too small for my head. Even when stretching it as the instructions suggest, it's tight.So, nice idea but not for me. But if your head is smaller it might work fine for you."
2,Didn't work,"I enjoy lap swimming and occasionally my ears get irritated from water getting ""stuck"" in them. Ear plugs don't stay in my ears for long so I found Ear Band-It in my search for a solution. I didn't mind the appearance of the Ear Band-it, and the size fit my head well, with and without my swim cap. But it simply didn't a) keep my ear plugs in (traditional ones, or the waxy kind), nor b) keep my ears dry by itself. So, I'm back to my routine of gently drying my ears with cotton swabs, and using swimmers-ear drying drops."
3,Works well but not with goggles,"Overall the ear bands are a great product, but they are a little difficult to wear if you are using goggles. They trend to slide up a little which defeats the purpose of having them."
2,I regret this purchase.,"I rather regret ordering this book. If I had seen it in a store, I think I would not have bought it. I loved the first two Lady Cottington books. They had the naughty pressed fairies, and a story that is told from the perspective of a little girl who doesn't really know what's going on.The Pressed Fairy Letters is a huge disappointment. The letters are hard to read, and don't tell a story. I also felt that some of the letters seemed out of character for the real people who were being portrayed.I'd send the book back, only the shipping would cost me more than the book did, so I guess I'll just give it away."
2,Couldn't tell from description/picture how large it is,This is a key ring for someone who carried a bundle of keys like a janitor. The item is so large it is the size of a large stone. Would not recommend for an average office worker. It's simply too big.
4,Where angels fear to tread,"A cross between KMFDM's brand of industro-metal, Mr. Bungle's schizophrenic stylistic shifts, and Sow's random multilingualism. Vibe on this band is either that they are the greatest band of all time or that they are lame bandwagoning ripoff artists. I would be hard pressed to agree with either of these statements. A good album overall."
2,Weak,"I could not imagine how this book could possibly help my family understand my condition of fibromyalgia. I bought it in desperation, to help them to understand my pain. What I got was a weak science fiction story with the main characters suffering from pain that seems to purely psycological in origin.I hate to hack on a writer so much, it's just that the review on this site seemed to imply that it would help my family understand my pain. I had to look very hard for any sembelance of real fibromyalic suffering.Not a bad story, but don't for a second think it's going to help your family understand the daily despair, suffering and stigma that comes with the disease."
1,Problems with Windows 7 64-bit,"Installed on Dell Vostro 200 Mini Tower running Windows 7 64-bit. Windows drivers didn't work - the card failed to see any firewire devices. I tried the Unibrain drivers off of the disc - still no luck. I then tried the latest Unibrain drivers from the Unibrain website - still the card failed to detect and mount any drives.This card clearly has compatibility problems with Windows 7 64-bit. I was running other firewire cards successfully (FW400), but this card has failed on every attempt."
4,Works with Mac and iSync (via Bluetooth!),"I've only had my phone for a day, but I wanted to correct some earlier reviews that stated otherwise. I did have to update iSync via Software Update, but after that the sync worked perfectly--all my address book contacts and calendar events popped right over--fantastic!"
4,"Good phone, great battery, nice display, but hoped for more.","This is a very nice phone. Much nicer than my Razr V3 that I returned 3 times because of the high pitched whining noise... if you can live with high pitched static when answering calls (yes, this only happens when answering... NOT when making an outside call). I like the color (and toying with changing the face plates) and the functionality with great battery life. Its camera is pretty descent as far as cell phones go. It is clear and works. It is not super fancy, though it has a lot of fuctionality. I am a bit disappointed that T-Mobile and Motorola don't have more choices right now, as I would have been happy to buy them. Anyway, if you want a good phone with Bluetooth (BT), then this is a very good one."
1,This phone sucks!,"I have this phone for just six months. I had charging problemafter using it for only four months. Today, this phone is deadbecause it can NOT be charged. The MOTO customer support askedme to send it back for a repair. How can you say this is aworkable solution? Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!"
1,Horrible phone - waste of money & time,"Never think of buying this phone. Ask me, this phone had lots problems but mainly it crashes and displays the main screen. I have missed more than 50% calls attended on this phone. While talking it disconnects on its own. I can't make call because it freezes. I am just waiting for 1 year of contract to complete and i will break this phone with my own hand. Totally waste of time & money. Never buy."
1,avoid this phone,"Have never before had such a poor experience with a single piece of electronic equipment. Returned the first one after 6 months as screen went dead. The replacement phone from T-mobile the screen failed again after two months, and the 2nd replacement refused to charge after about a month. I threw in the towel and accepted a replacement of a different model phone.I'm going back to Nokia with whom I've had far better experience in the last 10 years. No more Motorola for me."
1,$75 rebate? You'll be sorry...,"This is the worst phone we've ever owned. Drops calls like crazy, poorest reception ever, keypad locks up constantly, and the charger works intermittantly. First phone I have ever paid money for and the 5 free phones I've used before this one have all worked ten times better.I would not buy unless you are going to use the rebate towards a different phone!"
4,Works for me,"I've enjoyed my 330! It has performed as I have expected it to - equal to or better than ANY cellphone my friends, family or I have had (Moto, Nokia, Samsung). It could be improved upon (not many couldn't), but it's been just what I wanted: speakerphone, good & clear voice quality, good screen color & legibility, good (not great, but good) software - and sturdy, too! Throw in the adequate camera and bluetooth, and after 8 months, my 330 & I are doin' just fine...."
4,"great deal, bad clamshell","Ok here's a first Q, are the people who gave this phone a horrid rating check to make sure it was the V330 and NOT the V300? That brings me to my second point, the look of the phone is almost exactly the same as the V300 (now THIS particular model was almost crappy) so people might have confused it. A friend got this phone a little while ago and so far he seems to have no problem with it, in fact he is immensely satisfied and I am myself planning to get this phone and after much much asking around and reading countless reviews, I dont think the phone has bad reception OR drops calls , I would blame T-Mobile in some areas. So practice before you preach!!!"
1,It was great at first...,"Well I got this phone in June05, and for about 4 months everything worked great. The Bluetooth connected perfectly, no dropped calls, etc. Then, things started going downhill. First, my Bluetooth became flaky - sometimes the person I was talking to would not hear me so I hung up and called without it. Not a big deal, but annoying. Then the battery life got bad. OK, I bought a new battery - fixed. Then, the kicker - the phone would magically just ""lose"" the network despite not moving the phone. Then, my signal was not as good at my house despite being perfect months earlier. So, I bought an aftermarket antenna - I got a small improvement. To this day, the phone still loses the network and drops calls like crazy; sometimes when showing 4 bars! This is my first time back to Moto since the old startacs and I probably won't be back. I just ordered an unlocked Sony Z520a and I'm sure it will not suck as bad as this phone."
2,Poor Battery Life,"This was my first clamshell phone, and I like that aspect of the phone, but that's about it. It seems to have worse reception than my previous phones (all Nokia bar type) in the same coverage areas. The biggest issue is definitely the battery. I am NOT a heavy cell phone user so I like to just leave the phone in my car or gym bag and not worry about it for a couple days. This phone will drain in 8 hours to 36 hours - with MINIMAL USAGE. I don't know why it drains so quickly or with what seems to be random speeds, but it is extremely frustrating. Also, I am not thrilled with the intuitiveness (or lack thereof) of the menus, but I am sure I would have become familiar with them in time. I won't have a chance on this phone since I am looking to return mine ASAP.CONS:POOR Battery LifeWorse reception than previously owned phonesNot comfortable to holdPROS:Looks goodCompact"
4,I like it!,"I switched from a Samsung E715, which was a great phone. As this is my only phone, I need reliability, so I did quite a bit of research, and went ahead and bought it.Pros:Cool looking phone, sets itself apart, for sure.Bluetooth, I LOVE wireless headset feature!Nice screen, sound quality is fine.Cons:Hard to find a good case for it other than the dang puches.Speaker for ringtones and speakerphone is on the back. If you lay your phone down (or put it in one of the stupid ""pouches"") you will muffle the volume considerably.Takes forEVER to charge. Allow at least 4 hours every time.Overall, a good solid performer. I haven't experienced any of the issues the negative reviews stated, and am very happy with the phone.The BT headset I am using is the Cardo Scala 500, and they match up well.I have been a Tmobile customer for three years, and while I can get better coverage elsewhere, I have been spoiled by Tmobile's customer service, so they keep my business."
1,Be cautious with amazon.com rebate!,"I bought this phone in June 2006 with a 150$ rebate, but I still did not receive the rebate by Nov 7, 2006, called them tons of times, The reply is ""Please wait another 6-8 weeks to get the rebate"", so be cautious about the rebate when oreder a 1 cent cell phone."
1,Week Battery and Signal Strength,I am using this phone for last one month. This phone really looks great in terms of features. The signal is getting dropped frequently and end up receiving more voice messages than actual phone calls though phone is on.The battery gives only 12 hours standby or 60 minutes talk time.
3,"Nice, but could be a different color","I owned the V300 and found it to be a bit quirky, strange things would happen when ever I charged it, when it was finished all the personal settings would revert back to factory standard. They seemed to have fixed that with this latest version of the phone. My understanding is that they have combined the features from both the v300 and the v 600 to make this phone. I've only had it for 1 week and so far so good I always enjoyed functions such as speaker phone, voice dialing and voice memos, now I get the blue tooth and a much better redesigned key pad along with video clip capabilities. All of this is good news! If I had to pick a down side I would have to say that I'm dissapointed that Motorola decided to make this phone look exactly like the v300. I like what the body of the phone feels like, but a change of color would be better, maybe silver."
1,Worst reception ever...,"This phone has the worst reception, and worst sound of any phone I have ever used.I was excited to get this phone [upgraded from a SE T610 -- a wonderful phone besides the common recharging problem]. It had all the features that were important to me -- namely a colour screen, bluetooth, and lots of contacts. The phone was an utter let down.As stated above the reception is HORRIBLE. It will drop calls with all the bars showing, people are constantly saying, ""What?!? SPEAK UP?!?"" and that's IF you can understand what they are saying. The simple act of moving your head will change the reception quality. What good is a cell phone if you need to stand completely still, and don't interrupt the speaker (because interrupting the speaker degrades their voice quality).Stay AWAY from this phone."
1,Don't even try this phone,"This is the worst phone i ever used till now. If you need to delete any contact information, you will not get a second chance to recover for what you thought a second ago. Software used is very annonying."
3,V300 is just okay,I've had my phone since February and it's okay. At least once a day the phone just freezes up or hangs up on whoever I am talking to at that time. And it does that even when I have full signal. I plan on buying a new phone and from other review I've read it probably won't be another Motorola.
2,Designers evidently don't compare to other phones on the market,"The phone operates ok in terms of signal and battery. But, the menu system is completely outdated and non-user friendly (like all MOT phones). Do their software engineers even look at NOK phones to compare at all before they launch a new handset? They are light years behind in the interface. You still can't store several numbers for one person under one name (each has to be a seperate entry). The phone's green call button is on the right (should be on let like every other phone). The most annoying thing are the buttons on the side that constantly get pushed in your pocket and change the ring style and volume. Each time they change, it makes a loud beep. This phone is not worth getting, especially now (I had mine for a year and am looking for a better phone now as a replacement). MOT phones in general are to be avoided."
3,Do they call THAT an address book?,"Like most people these days, I use my cell phone for almost everything. And the organizer/addressbook/phonebook/appointment book MUST work. This phone's so called phonebook, is just that. Phone numbers! Oh yes, it does include names, and even email addresses. Big deal! Are we supposed to maintain a separate organizer for street addresses, and various other important notes?That, along with not having the wonderful email functions of my Nokia 3650, has made me decide to return the Motorola 330, after only having had it for less than a week. So much for a second phone line. At least maybe until the new Razor comes out in October.I thought maybe I could live with those ""minor"" problems, but I guess I'm just too demanding.Aside from that...it's a decent phone. :)"
1,Never had this type of experience from Amazon,"I really do not know to whom I can blame for this problem. The phone V330 always in trouble even after getting new equipment (no battery) from T-mobile. The battery looses the charge every 1 hour talk. I never use any extra features in the phone except call receiving and talking. I have reported this issue to T-mobile but the issue is not solved yet. Other problem is, T-Mobile coverage is extremly poor in Orange County area(Sou. CA). This is something I did not know before buying this plan.Finally I decided that, this is my last purchase with Amazon.com"
1,this is a piece of crap,"I just got this phone with T-mobile's 600min plan. It turns out they are nothing but piece of crap. Signal was lost averagly every 8 min and no signal at all in my living room. I never gone through a complete call. I don't know which part is the problem, T-mobile or this phone but I would suggest anybody not to buy this phone and T-mobile plan."
2,Broken after warranty up,I've had this phone for 1 1/2 years. Over the past month I've been fighting getting it to work when flipped open. Took it to Tmobile for service and told would cost $70 for maintenance or buy another for over $100.Have never dropped this phone! I would argue that it's poor quality- very disappointed.
1,v330 sucks,"v330 sucks, every now and then the phone gets disconnected, poor voice quality, bad signal strength inside the house....I am returning it within the three day of purchase s I am totally pissed of with it."
2,Disappointed with the quality,"I've had this for almost a year now and its not upto the expected quality.Its very slow in retrieving numbers from the memory and things like that when compared to Nokia which is much faster. Also not very user friendly.The pictures are not very sharp or good enough and I had to buy a digital camera after I bought this phone.Overall, not very pleased as there are better phones in the market."
1,T-mobile and V330 SUCK!!!,"I've had, under warranty, 4 V330 phones since switching to T-Mobile in July '05. There is a software glitch that shuts down the phone at random. After replacing the 5th one with a RAZR, my voice mail is not working. I cancelled my contract with T-Mobile and will return to Cingular."
2,Not that bad of a phone,"I have used tons of motorola phones over the years from the v120 to the v330. The v330 does have a couple problems with it well at least for me it did. After a couple months I had problems using the chargers. I switched out 4 chargers, and each one would work good for a couple weeks, then you would have to fiddle with them to charge the phone.One thing they didn't mention the review though, is the ability to listen to the radio on the phone. Thing is you need to buy a special headset, I haven't got the headset myself t-mobile wanted $50 for it. But my overall review of the phone is if you have the chance pass on this one. There's alot more models out, and ones that have less bugs then this phone has."
1,Worst phone ever.,"This is the worst phone ever made. It's side buttons are unlockable. You can't set the ring style without making a sound. It is hard to charge. And it breaks. The backlight on my first one broke, so I couldn't see the screen. When I got the warranty replacement, it worked fine for a while until the ear speaker started cutting out. I am still stuck with this phone until I can get a new one (which will not be a Motorola), but until then I have to deal with not being able to hear people. It is so embarrasing to answer the phone and have to say, ""Hello? Hello? ... Hello?"" and wiggle it around until I can hear them."
3,dropped calls,"My old Nokia almost never dropped a call, but my new Motorola V330 can drop from 1 to 4 calls per day, in the same area, with the same service provider. Everything else about the phone is very good, except the ring volume button is outside the flip top, and it is easy to accidently change it to soft or silent, and then miss a call. It would be better if this button was protected, like the key pad is."
2,Mediocre at best. Takes 6 hours to charge!,The battery life is poor and it takes 6 hours to charge this monster. The phone quality is a bit flimsy especially for motorola; so don't drop it or buy a really good case. Outside of that the phone works and the camera is o.k. If I had the choice again I would go with a nokia phone.
4,"Great cutaways, but a little small",Another enjoyable Mick Badrocke and Bill Gunston collaboration. Fun to peer into the corners on Badrocks's drawings. I only wish they were reproduced a little larger.
5,"Wow, This is soul/jazz/funk cookin Gil & Brian style","This is a wonderful release from the magnificent Gil Scott Heron, Brian Jackson collaboration. These guys have created a new level of excellence in the soul/funk/jazz genre that is hard to surpass. I love the live version of The Bottle, it gives so much more grunt than the studio version. 17th Street live makes you wanna holler and clap your hands, even when driving, so it can be dangerous. Timeless - all rappers, you owe these guys!"
5,Falsehood book.,"This book is a wowser. The perfect best that is much better than those books by Dr. Quinn, such as the one on fairy tales and mormonism, which I believe. An asset to any libray opn Moronism."
1,Who knows LDS doctrine better than the LDS?,"I have never been able to understand why someone wanting to understand LDS doctrine (a.k.a. Mormonism) would read such a book by someone who must ""explain"" our doctrine, apparently better than can we members of the LDS Church. I have yet to read such a book that is accurate or that is not, in one way or another, repeating untrue beliefs or malicious lies about the LDS that are simply not accurate or factual. If you want to know the truth about what we LDS believe, simple contact the Church. They will send two of our 60,000 missionaries to your home to explain our doctrine to you. They do not charge for this, nor do they brainwash people. They simply explain the truth to you and let you decide for yourself. There is no reason to waste money on a book such as this one that apparently contains errors and mistakes and repeats common fallacies about the LDS Church."
1,this is sherlock holmes?,"Buffalo Bill? Annie Oakley? Frank Butler? Moriarty back from the dead? A Time Machine? Werewolves? Doctor Jekyll? A 'half brother' unrecognizable as Moriarty himsef to the world's Best Consulting Detective? Holmes in Love? Wild West accents straight out of a cartoon? Twisted contrived plots.Holy Moly there Batman.....Actually Batman mysteriously didn't appear above the rooftops of London but who would have been surprised.page 135; 'Believe it or not Watson, I thing I'm beginning to understand a few things...' Well, he is Holmes and I am not...Like Watson I have to ask; 'Do you have any idea what is really going on?'To the true Holmes fan this has nothing to do with Sherlock Holmes except to arbitrarily burden the main character with that name. What a shame for the reader and at $17. plus shipping and handling.Skip this book and author."
1,Not all that great!!!!!,"NOT all that great!I'm glad that I bought it, because I have loved the way, Piaf sang for a very long time...but, since she pressumably wrote this book herself, she tells things her way, & NOT all that much!SO, I would be interested in a Biogrphy written by somebody else, who really did the research, & told me everything there is to know about Piaf!I feel like I have found out, very little!Sara Gutierrez"
3,Piaf's own version of her life,"Piaf understandably didn't want to rehash her horrific childhood and early life in this (and another) autobiography. Any international star would want to put the best gloss possible on abandonment by one's parents (both alcoholics), poverty, bad associates (pimps, thieves, and drug dealers), a flirt with a murder (Louis Laplee's), and her years as a child in a brothel (owned by her grandmother). But the reader does get a flavor of her own words and oeuvre. The best Piaf biography at present is David Bret's, detailed and highly readable."
3,snail books move slow too,"The book got to me at a snail pace. For some one that is suppose to have the book when I ordered it, it seemed that a month was a long time to get the book. I have never had my order take so long."
5,Transcends Its Tine,"Stanley Weinbaum passed away before I was first exposed to his stories, and I started reading them some 60 years ago. When he wrote the title story, little was known about the Solar System, but Weinbaum's concept of Mars was well within what was then known. Weinbaum's native Martians were believably alien, and the adventures of his main characters quite acceptable.Weinbaum's other stories were equally well crafted. Although our knowledge technically puts his tales into the realm of fantasy, they were faithful to the scientific knowledge of the 1940s. The stories are very entertaining, and memorable. (Weinbaum was well-read, but -- a nit -- he never studied Egyptology, which cases a tiny glitch in one of the stories.)"
1,Sizing is wrong!,"Ordered for my 3 year old and it was too big. Not to mention the ""S"" on the front of the costume was ripped. Very disappointed!"
2,Costume was incomplete and size is way off,The costume I ordered was missing the cape as well as the belt. I ordered a size 12 - 14 child size and it looked loike it would fit an adult instead of a 11 year old girl.
2,A thin cut,"I'm a Grady fan, but there's just not enough on this video to justify the price. It's a collection of tidbits, a random collection of shots, with nothing to hold it together. Maybe it would be pure gold to an experienced one hole player who needed just the shot Grady was teaching. I was looking for something more basic, more strategic. So if you already know the game well, there might be something here for you that would pay for the DVD. If you're new to the game, you won't get much help."
4,IN OUR DEFENSE,The product was delivered in a timely manner and was as described by the seller. It is an interesting book concerning Bill of Rights and I found the book to be very informative.
5,great book,This book gives a historical perspective on the bill of rights in action. The Bill of rights is a living breathign document whic various supreme court judgements gave life to. This is recommned to anyone interested in how constituion affects Ameica. Highly recommnded!.
4,Important guide to our rights,"The legal process is complex to most average citizens, so this book offers an explanation of the process for challenges and decisions based on our Bill of Rights. It is an important resource for those studying or thinking about what happens in our court system, and why it happens as it does. A valuable reference for home or school libraries."
1,Does not fit Doge Magnum,"Says it fits a 2005-2008 Doge Magnum, it does not this part (20002) is actually for a 1984-2001 Jeep Cherokee witch have completely different cargo areas your best bet is part (20051) for a Magnum but it is in black not gray."
5,The Importance of Forgivenes,I found this book to be life changing. In just 4 short chapters amazing blessings occur when you apply what is inside. I wanted to rent one of ths planes that have banner behind saying: Required reading for the whole human race - read and apply!!!
2,It lost me fast....,"I am no fan of the big chemical companies. I do agree with healthy living. But this film lost me when they started attacking MSG. It's an additive that they say contributes to obesity and shortens the lifespan and as they imply makes kids stupid. They lost me there because the Japanese consume huge amounts of the stuff and yet they have the longest lifespans in the industrial world, they don't have an obesity problem and they do pretty damn well in school.The other thing was they didn't show that dentists and dental assistants should have the highest rates of cancer based on all the poisonous mercury vapors given off by amalgam fillings.I just didn't find the first part very convincing enough to continue with it."
2,Over Rated,"Anyone who is willing to give themselves a coffee enema has some serious problems. This is a poor production with some good points. The narration done be the boys father is so annoying thruout the film - I almost shut it off several times. Just to reiterate it definitely showed me some shocking things, but it just isn't quite up to par by production standards. Also, this was not done by the 15 y/o boy, it was done by his father, the boy was just along for the ride."
2,Poorly produced.,"First of all, I am already a believer and biased toward the message of this movie. Vegan and raw diets are healthy, environmentally responsible, and big agri business have hijacked our food and well-being. I am also a fan of the Gerson Therapy, although I don't think it's The Cure in all cases. The reason I give this movie 2 stars is that the writing and production is dis-jointed and narrated like the viewer is a child. Which brings me to the 15 year old boy who is taking us on this journey to discover the Gerson Therapy because he's failing school. ????? I know. Does not make sense. It's bad folks and you're better of Googling the information you need about Gerson, vegan diets and cancer prevention than spending your money on this."
5,Great information,"I wish all of our science classes had to watch this documentary. I am impressed that a 15 year old even had the desire to know this information and even more impressed at his persistence in finding out the truth. This documentary is full of great information and is enjoyable to watch. It is too bad so many people are fooled into believing that traditional medicine actually helps but the t.v. has done a great job selling the pharmaceuticals and people believe the lies. We can't believe the barbie commercials, why would you believe a pharmaceutical commercial. I appreciate this film trying to spread hope and truth."
5,Beautiful Truth,"My friend recommended this movie and I just had to get it based on that. I'm so glad the movie was available at a reasonable price, it arrived quickly, and it was in excellent condition. Thanks for being so dependable. JP"
1,not current in documentary style.,"The filming and editing are not how a current documentary is done. The info is relevant and I like the documentary from that aspect. However, the narrator is horrible and is very boring to listen to. Watch food inc. For an example of a good documentary shot and edited in a current style."
1,Testimoninals Aren't Evidence,All I saw was a bunch of testimonials not one double blind or peer reviews study was quoted. I think this does a huge disservice in misinforming the public on what really works.
1,Batcrap,"This film presents a wide-ranging panoply of wing-nuttery. Much there is about the treatment of cancer and big pharma that can be criticized, but this movie is so benighted, so utterly foolish, it does no service to anyone. More importantly, convincing people to treat their cancer in the manner promoted by this movie might well result in death or disability (as has been shown in at least one small study). There is no credible science in this movie. Arrant and patronizing batcrap."
1,One of the Worst Produced Documentaries I've Seen,"This movie takes what is undoubtedly an interesting subject and molds it into a barely watchable 90 minute event. Garret comes off as a marionette, with the faceless narrator playing puppet-master and prophet, and guiding his every thought and action. The movie borders on creepy at times, in its portrayal of The Boy's 'independent' search for truth (i.e. not at all independent, but 100% decided for him by the mysterious narrator, for whom's benefit this whole charade was obviously concocted).I'm not speaking at all to the validity of any claims made in the movie (you can decide for yourself, and many of the other reviews cover those issues thoroughly), but the overall quality of film production is awful, and I hope the filmmakers seriously reconsider ever taking on a new project."
5,WARNING this movie may cause EXTREME WELLNESS,"Dr. Max Gerson saved my life. PLEASE WATCH THIS MOVIE. IT could save the life of someone you know or may know in the future. The Gerson Therapy is saving people from having their testicles, eyes, prostates, removed and discarded. And after all that the patient still has a severe metabolic breakdown, and just maybe they'll throw in a little chemical cocktail for an expensive, sickening finish. PLEASE BUY THIS MOVIE! For the sick and the suffering. This movie will change your life if you let it. TOO ALL THE DR. GERSON HATERS>>> TOO BAD COMMON SENSE ISN't COMMON. I personally know many cases of true wellness caused by the content of this Movie. Thank you for reading."
5,THIS COULD SAVE YOUR...OR YOUR LOVED ONE'S...LIFE,"The Beauitful Truth is so beautifully done and so powerful. It is a must OWN...share it with your family and your friends. If more people knew about this so many lives would not be lost to cancer. Host a ""Movies That Matter"" event at home and invite your family, friends, neighbors. What you all will learn was discovered almost a hundred years ago. It has saved many lives and will save many more."
4,Depends on audience,"Most of the information in the video I was already familiar with so it was a ""review"" for me. The simplistic production that has been criticised as being directed at ""child level"" viewing, is actually great if you are watching the video with your kids, which I was. It really stuck with my daughter, who is the same age as the boy in the film. I found the format to be very effective in getting the word out regarding the pharmaceutical, food production & dental industries, and the inter-twining of each of them with our tunnel vision system of western medicine. You cannot deny most of the info. and simply ""following"" the proverbial ""money"", will lead you to much of the same conclusion. Also, the personal touch of a home school boy doing research added a bit more human interest making it less dry than most documentary type productions."
5,Beauty In The Beautiful Truth,"I come from a nutritionist's background professionally and know the difference in eating organic foods versus those processed by large food conglomerates. The beautiful truth exposes the fact that the american cancer society, supported by the AMA are co-conspirators in keeping the public blind to more highly successful cancer treatments and other debillating diseases than is promoted and accepted by conventional medicine. Proper juicing as per Dr. Max Gerson in the treatment of cancer has over a 70% success rate, whereas radiation therapy and chemo therapy range in the 12-17% success rate. If you were aware of these factors of success and had any of the list of diseases the Gerson organization treats successfully, which would you chose? This movie convinces me not to blindly accept the claims of large food corporations and medical profiteers."
3,Jhelisa - Friendly Pressure,"Jhelisa's first big splash, FRIENDLY PRESSURE, gets mixed by Cool Breeze, who produced the majority of her album GALACTICA RUSH. Here, he brings out the percussion for some hip-hop thumping and the turntables for some scratches. Wisely, Jhelisa's vocals still take center stage."
4,ALTA MODA,THIS 2 CD SET IS NAMED SHOW & PARTY. sHOW IS ACTUALLY BETTER THAN PARTY WITH GREAT UPBEAT CHILL MUSIC.A GREAT MIX OF LATIN AND TECHNO. JUST BOUGHT 6 NEW CD SETS AND THIS WAS THE BEST BY FAR.
2,Limited use!,"My sons are into building things - legos, standard unit blocks and anything they can get their hands on. They do like this set and didn't even need to look at the instructions to build the outside. Because of the odd dimensions of these Haba blocks, they cannot be integrated into other structures and thus put a limit of creativity. If the dimensions are consistent with standard unit blocks, they will get taken out more often to play. Also, this set has just enough blocks to make the pyramid in the picture, so there is no way to close the pyramid's ""door"". Could be better, but this is the only pyramid blocks we have found..."
4,Haba Pyramid,"well made, cute idea, only thing I noticed, though, was that it seemed too complicated for my present class of four and five year old children; it did not offer instant gratification, like the Egyptian Playmobile did"
4,Great Building Set,"We purchased this for our son for his 5th birthday as he is currently obsessed with ancient Eqypt. He loves it. We have built it multiple times, and he is already using this set with another Haba set he got last year. The Haba blocks are very nice, and its neat to have these unusually shaped blocks to use with all the others we have in the house. The Great Sphinx is a wonderful addition as well."
1,Missing Stuff,My kit was missing the back massager and I didn't know how to get ahold of the seller. I am very unsatisfied. The product should include what it says it includes.
2,"Cheap quality, no exact length","I ordered this cable a few weeks ago. Although I must say that it does work fine, the cable looks cheap (in fact, it is very thin) and its length is less than 6 feet. As you may agree, length does matter so you do not want to fall short when it comes to that. So for $20 (including shipping), I think it was not exactly a good deal."
1,Tiger USB-Parallel Cable does not work,"It did not work when received. I tried the cable on two laptops, and neither would print to a laser printer. I substituted another cable, and it worked fine on both laptops. This cable did not work. Having difficulty getting Tiger to replace the product."
1,never could get it to work,Tried everything I could think of and had every IT person I knew take a look. Tried it on laptop as well as desktop - had to install the drivers. All systems appear to be a go and yet nothing will make this print. Very disappointing and I can't even return it. (I ruined the package accidentally)I really thought I had an easy solution.
1,unable to use,Returned item. Don't know due to the issue with the HP722 and Windows 7 I was unable to get the printer to work. I was told it is a Window 7 issue. When will I receive the credit for this product?
5,Works with HP Laserjet4 and Windows Vista 64bit,After reading of installations glitches experienced by other users I thought there was a possibiliy of problems. I have an old HP Laserjet (1st year they made it) and a new Dell machine w/ 64 bit Win Vista. There is no installation CD and none was needed. I used the printer set-up instructions in windows and set the printer to print to the virtual USB driver instead of LPT1. The instructions indicated that there are downloadable drivers for Win ME and Win 98 on their website. My printing experience has so far been compatible to the parallel interface I had on an older machine.
1,Did not work with Powerbook G4 and HP Laserjet 5L,"My HP Laserjet 5L did not go ""online"" when connected to my powerbook G4 using the cable. The cable did not work using the driver Apple supplies with OSX. My laptop never recognized that a printer had been connected."
4,Weird instalation...,"The cable works very well, I now can use the printer I had forgotten due to the lack of parallel port in my computer. Installation manual, however, goes only up to windows 2000, which leads me to think that the product is rather old, or that Plug'N'Play usually takes care of this. I had a little puzzle to solve before I managed to make it work, but in the end I realized that the ""Printer Spooler"" service was disabled from within windows. Once enabled, everything worked perfectly."
1,Mac OS X User? Don't even consider this.,This product doesn't work with modern OS X versions. I bought it and wasted over 30 mins trying to get it to work. A visit to cablesunlimited's website revealed that the latest version of OS X this works with is 10.3.
4,Check your printer before ordering,"Some printers, e.g., HP Color LaserJet 4550, have parallel connectors that do not mate with this device. Forewarned is forearmed. A word to the wise.."
4,Works great,"This thing saved an HP 2100 from the trash heap. The Network Card went bad on this office printer. My IT guy says, ""the parallel port should still work."" Bought this...now I have my own private printer in my office instead of using the shared network printer! :-)The instructions are pretty clear. I plugged this thing in and Win XP automatically took care of everything and it worked. However, I read the instructions and they said to change some of the automatic defaults (instructions are VERY clear in the packaging)...I did and haven't looked back now for weeks. I just wish it came in a slightly longer cable length. Your printer has to be very close to your printer with this length which works out to be about 4 feet...just too short to run around your desk. Kind of commits you to having your printer on your desk. Haven't tried it with an extension cable so can't comment on that."
3,Should Have Just Bought New Printer,Took a bit of finesse to get my HP 832C printer to work with Windows 7. Printer works fine but parallel printer connections went out years ago.
1,Never did work,"Well installation is certainly easy, just plug it in. Printer drivers are loaded, but never could get the cable to work? Never could print anything. Gave up in frustration."
5,So easy to use,"I have an HP Deskjet 932C printer which is about 10 years old, and I have a Dell Inspiron 5 laptop with Windows 7 which is less than a year old. The cord worked so well. I plugged it in, and my Dell laptop immediately downloaded the drivers without having to insert the CD that was provided. The drivers were then installed automatically, and the printer was immediately added to my laptop as approved hardware. This took a total of about 3 minutes. I tried to print something and it worked the very first time. The cord is just the right length too, and it appears to be durable. I'm very satisfied with this product."
3,Half of it was ok...,"Well I almost wanted to get my money back after reading the first few stories, they were not well written nor were they consistent with ""the world of krynn"". It seemed like they took place on another world...these newer lance authors shouldnt have such freedom to go and create races or things, the story ""Boojum Boojum"" illustrates my point quite well. Other than the above; the stories by the ""real"" lance authors made up for the beginning. Get it only if you want hear more about the 5th Age..."
3,Simple and Rather Elementary,"This text examines various techniques to achieve more concise and memorable prose. However, there are other books on style that would be more beneficial: William Strunk, ""Elements of Style."" Jones' text is rather costly for a paperback, which is another drawback; however, for the novice technical writer with rudimentary writing skills, this book will suffice."
4,Turtle Fast. Easy to make into an Expensive Coaster,"About the best 50GB BD disk you can buy, but you would be much better off spending more for the rewritable version. Most of the BD burners for sale are bundled with CyberLink software which is very buggy. My first attempt with a Panasonic disk, the software crashed the computer and I got a $45.00 coaster (tax write-off). 2nd attempt with a Sony disk worked well.Need patience for this backup method. Around 1 hours to burn data even with a Gen 2 BD burner."
4,Reliable archiving to Blu-ray,"I have used the dual layer media only once so far but it worked well enough to store video data up to 47 gigs or so. The media claims 50 gigs but really you can't get 50 gigs on there. Same with the 25 gig, single layer media, you can only burn 23 gigs or so. I wish Sony would produce a 4x record speed version (like Panasonic has) and of course we are all waiting for this media to drop in price now that Blu-ray has won the HD media war. Tip: Be sure you understand what version of UDF you are working with prior to burning data to the disc. Some UDF only read on Vista software. I wasted two 25 gig discs learning this."
2,Damning with Faint Praise: Expensive Turtle Coasters Revisited,"Another lifer sliding down the bleeding edge. I agree--spend another $10 to get the rewritable version.After finally getting the settings on my Mac right (1x (ugh!!), buffer underrun protection), I managed tosuccessfully write 4 discs: 2 had verification failures on reread, 1 hung during verification, and 1 wrote/verifiedsuccessfully. I was thrilled--the first three attempts before calling the vendor re above cretinous parametersettings are now...coasters. However, all in all, it's better than the 25 CDs I'd have to burn, but without charming multi-volume capability. I'm more or less happy, I guess, and think that I may be able toread the 4 I have, if I ever need to, maybe. Hoping this gets cheaper, easier, faster soon."
5,Amazing product,"Ever since the burners started to come out I fell in love with these.I love the idea of having all my personal pictures, movies documents and other on a single disc. And the fact that it's not easy to damage these helps too.I bought a couple of these since I got my burner and the only problem was my mistake while burning one of these that made one disk unusable which gave me a chance to test the strength of this baby.No problems otherwise, they play perfectly on PS3 my pictures, movies or the recent one used for movies; Star Wars Prequel trilogy and Matrix Trilogy in 1080p."
2,Warning: sample first and buy individual tracks!,"There are a couple of really great trad tracks in here, but there is a lot of sheer crap, albeit by recognized performers from a variety of genres. Richard Thompson's Mingulay Boat Song is excellent, the scurrilous Good Ship Venus sung by Loudon Wainwright III is almost as raucous as the version I learned, and delivered in a simple melodic style. SAMPLE the tracks first, or you will be scratching your head, these are all over the sea lanes, with a few hanging out in the trees somewhere inland. I was impressed that Sting was doing some of these, his style is a bit overproduced (the presence of soft choral backup vocals with harmonies in major thirds!) but the main melodic line is generally straightforward, at least; much more authentic job on main line of Blood Red Roses than on Shallow Brown. There are gems on this album, just pick through."
4,An Enjoyable Disc,"Overall this collection is quite enjoyable. I have read reviews that criticize it for not being true to historical sea chanteys, but I don't think that is necessarily what the artists were going for here. I think that it is their modern day interpretations. Most of the songs are very well performed. Some are haunting and some are beautiful, and some are both haunting and beautiful."
1,"It Blows, Boys, Blows","Having listened to and sung chanties and sea tunes as a pirate reenactor for a few years, I had eagerly awaited this compilation for some time. What a disappointment. There are a few decent tracks, but by and large, the contemporary interpretations don't work at all. Some of the performances are just friggin' bizarre. The liner notes suggest a second 2-disc volume is forthcoming in 2007. Don't bother. Stick with Stan Hugill or Tom Lewis. Better yet, try the recordings of local and regional performers on the renfaire circuit, like The Pyrates Royale, The Corsairs, The Jolly Rogers, The Crimson Pirates, or The Brigands."
3,Piracy on the high Cs,"If you are looking for a CD that gives you a historical sense of the sound and lilt of sea chanteys and such, this is not for you. This album mixes fairly straightforward renditions of 19th and 18th century sea songs and work chanteys with some rather peculiar takes on the genre. The Johnny Depp connection is rather distant, ISTM, and seems present as an indirect tie-in to his ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films.If you are are interested in a more faithful rendition of the genre, I suggest ""Blow, Ye Winds, in the Morning"" by John Langstaff and the Revels crew."
5,Great Collection of Pirate & Sea Chantey Tunes,"If you have an ounce of love for the sea, and a tad bit more interested in pirate tunes, you'll love this double cd collection. I've gifted it to a half dozen friends who own boats, love time on the water and on occasion, drink a bit of rum...all with a bit of pirate in their hearts.This CD set will not disappoint....songs from Sting, Bono and many others who I didn't know, but do now (like Baby Gramps)"
1,Disappointment would be an understatement,"It is not unusual to find sea shanties performed by not the greatest musicians or singers in the world. It is not unusual to find shanties sung by people who have difficulty keeping perfect pitch, or tempo. But at least they understand what the music is about, and sing it with heart and enthusiasm and a love for the genre.Hal Wilner should stick to whatever genre it is that made him know enough to be approached by labels, because he clearly has no understanding, and less enthusiasm for *this* genre.If you love lively music from the maritime era, you can only be bitterly disappointed by this collection. Out of 43 tracks, I found 15 that were salvageable. Sort of.I've already tossed this onto the pile to go to the resale shop. It wasn't worthy the cost of shipping."
1,hal wilner does it again,a worthy addition to hals esoteric colection of themed compilations get them all if you can.
1,awful,"I have been listening to, and performing both sea songs and Irish folk music for a long time now.This is perhaps the worst collection of chantey songs I have literally ever listened to, and some of my collection was recorded many years ago by old people literally wailing into a microphone.I hope the sequel to this album is better because this one left a lot to be desired.Fathom the Bowl is the only good track on the whole thing"
2,Rogue's Gallery,"After hearing a radio interview with creator, the music quality and song types on the CD were not what I expected. Too much of this is eclectic music placed in a maritime format."
5,"Another AWESOME Hal Willner production, warts & all","I am not going to get into all the details of each tune as that has been done by other reviewers. All I know is that once I loaded each disc in my CD player, I had to listen to ALL of it. While I am no sea shanty - or even traditional folk - archivist, the selections here are authentic enough. One may not like the various interpretations for one reason or another, but this is a fantastic compilation with some truly outstanding performances. While I am no die-hard Bono fan, his ghostly, atmospheric take on ""A Dying Sailor to His Shipmates"" sent chills up my spine.I suppose it's not for everyone, but heck - what is? A great addition to the traditional/eclectic catalogue; and, again, kudos to Hal Willner for getting things like these together in a fearless, irreverent mode."
5,Hal Wilner does it again,"Let get this out of the way. This is NOT a recording for children. This is NOT an attempt to recreate sea songs as they might have been sung at the time of their creation.Hal Wilner has over the the last twenty six years produced the most interesting tribute recordings around, from Nino Rota, Kurt Weill, T. Monk and my personal favorite Charles Mingus, he gathers interesting musicians, and says to them, I am guessing here: ""do your thing to this music"". This recordings are modern spins on these songs, and damn entertainig spins they are."
5,"Rogue's Gallery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs, and Chanteys",This is a very unique compilation of songs. I would say this CD is for adults only due to some graphic language. The songs vary from love songs to what I would call comedic. I enjoyed listening to it very much and have already recommended it to several people.
1,"If you like sea shanties, don't buy this.","A lot of research went into finding the songs to go into this album, so it's a real shame that almost every one of them is completely massacred by the performing artists, if these songs were sung in the way they are supposed to be, i.e. without pop intro's and melodic background music, then the album would probably be fine.If you are a fan of sea shanties, or if you are just interested in what they sound like, don't buy this album, the well-known names are all a gimmick and the music is unfortunately just awful. Enough to put you off for good."
3,"The Good, The Bad and the Ugly","As advertised, this is a collection of Sea Songs and Chanteys. Some are quite interesting and some are not. The same can be said of the performances which don't necessarily align themselves with the quality of the songs. Some are good, some are bad and some are just plain ugly.Some of the songs are done in an ""old style"". They attempt to be recreations of old songs from centuries gone by. Others are done in a very modern style; electric guitars and such were not much in vogue on the Spanish Main. Example of both can be good or bad. A few are just plain ugly.This was interesting but I don't think it will have a place in my normal listening rotation."
3,aaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrghhhhhhhhhhhhh!,"Some of the songs are quite good(mellow)others a little odd. Its what I expected, but not what you would expect."
1,Save your money,"Please save your money. This CD compilation is truly abysmal. When I first heard that there was a new recorded collection of traditional ballads and sea chanteys, I was excited enough to pre-order it. Huge mistake. This is a positively unlistenable collection. If you're looking for traditional sea songs, this is not the collection you want."
3,interesting,"It has some good songs and some great artists like Sting, Richard and Teddy Thompson, but nothing just hits you and says ""that was a great song."""
2,Despite the validity of artistic interpretation...,"...and the reputation of Hal Willner, neither can account for how well over half of this album is nigh-unlistenable. If it wasn't touted as being produced by two well known people who made a very traditional pirate movie, then I could accept the decidedly non-traditional nature of the majority of the songs.Traditionalists: Stay away, or find the handful of songs that are salvageable elsewhere.Non-traditionalists: Stop ragging on the traditionalists for griping about this badly mis-marketed album. That's fine if you like it. I and many others don't."
1,Fathom the bowell (movement #44),"That's what they should've labeled this quick-drying three-coiled steamer as. It is derivative and poorly produced and almost brutal and painful to listen to in several places.I too, like many, bought this CD and had to return it several times because the disks wouldn't play. I didn't give up though, as I have a tendency to sail myself over the deep end when I'm curious. In this instance, I expended much more energy than the journey was worth.It's a good sign that even when technology refuses to listen to it, you're probably better off. Sometimes the gods of technology trump the scallywags of yesteryear.I bought this because I love sailing movies and have listened to Chanteys and Sailing music for quite some time.Unfortunately, this is just corporate pooh - brought forward - hoping for you to happily smear it all over yourselves in exchange for cold, hard currency.Absolutely shameful, me hearties."
3,People you play this for may worry about you,"First, you can shock and horrify your friends by playing this collection for them in its' entirety. They will think you are insane for owning it and might be worried about their relationship with you just because the bizarre tracks are so overpowering of the superior tracks. Then, you can whittle it down to the faves and make a darn sure good collection that will stay in the player for a long time. You'll listen a bunch of times and play the short version for someone (who will be floored) but then they'll buy it and play it long-form...and be horrified. Ha ha! April Fools. Love ya, Hal, I have all your stuff."
4,Mostly brilliant,"I was just transferring this album to my MP3 player which has very limited storage. So limited in fact that I had to go through the tracks and drop the duds. After listening to every single one, I could only drop about 1/4 of the tracks and some of those reluctantly. The rest are simply great - sing along at the top of your lungs great.I appreciate that this particular release might rankle fans of the genre but as a sea shanty newbie, I'm not expecting or even wanting authenticity. Love this album."
3,"Great Idea, Uneven Execution","This is a Hal Willner production, which practically guarantees some very eccentric production choices: material unsuited to the performer, unusual and often genre-inappropriate arrangements, a rough 'live' feel. So some of it works and a lot doesn't. You could make a great single disc out of this double set, but for my money there's too much outright awful music here."
4,A Pirate's Treasure,"An extremely entertaining and somewhat inappropriate Pirate Masterpiece. (That is what we like about pirates. It is politically correct for pirates to be inappropriate!) The musicians paint vivid pictures with their lyrics. It was also fascinating to read how this album was pulled together. Not only will the pirate in your life enjoy this collection, the mermaid will too!"
1,another set of hopes are smashed,"the selection of titles attracted me. The quality of the arrangements, the voices, and the music---are all quite bad.It is VERY sad that these same titles, could not have been produced for quality. They sound like a nightmare."
1,"Rogue's Gallery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs, and Chanteys",I didn't like it at all. I was expecting music similar to the music in Pirates of the Carribean. Probably my fault for not reading the description in detail.
1,Buy something else!,"This CD had a few songs I already knew, and some that I didn't. I thought it would be nice to hear a new take on some of my old favorites, and learn a few new songs. In many ways, it was what I was looking for. These recordings would certainly qualify as a ""new take."" This CD delivers less traditional sea shanties and more industrial rock pirates. A few of the songs are nice, but most of them are just iritating. Some are like eating glass.This CD is neither what I expected, nor what I wanted. My very strong recommendation would be to buy something else."
1,Dreadful and Alarming,"There is a very good chance genuine Pirates could have voices of varying and unusual quality so I will not criticize some of the unique sounds emanating from the CD. However what a mishmash of quality, some good some bad.How about authenticity? What IS this set of CD's? A curiousity methinks, very little else."
2,Not That Great,"We bought this thinking it would offer information that every other Las Vegas guide offered. That is not the case. It's just as informative as the rest, which isn't saying much. If you are looking for in depth information on hot spots or different places than just the regular strip fodder, this ain't the book for you."
