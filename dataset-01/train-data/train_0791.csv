3,Another missing song...,"Another good song this CD is missing other than ""High Roller"": Fatboy Slim - Right Here Right Now, used during one of the final race scenes. Although the music throughout the movie was great, this CD lacks the two songs that would really make me want this soundtrack. Sure these songs are on dozens of other soundtracks and singles, but it really gets you into the driving mood... one song flowing to the next, as you pass your friendly local law enforcement represenitive."
5,What's that song ???,I'm also trying to find out the name of the song that plays at the beginning of the final race. Does anyone know what it is or who it's by?
2,a little help?,"i was looking for the song that was played during the pre-race stuff for the last race of the movie, detroit. it's really haunting and really good. it's played when the drivers are putting their equipmenton and strapping into their machines. it just reminds me of when me and my pals gear up for our stuff... thanks for any help."
1,Feeble,"As others have noted, the soundtrack misses the best driving songs from the movie, or at least those songs that would have captured the spirit of a movie about racing. This compilation seems more like it was taken from ""Coal Miner's Daughter"".A disappointment."
2,pod,"can someone tell me the song that is played in the club during the begining of the moive.they perform it during the movie and it looks like POD, but i don't know what song it is. it's also played at the last race in the movie. i think it's P.O.D but i don't know the name of the song. i can't find it on the soundtrack. the song is played throughout the movie and it's not on the soundtrack."
2,I can't find a song,"I am looking for the song that starts, when Stalone and Bly r racing in the town right when they pass near the woman dressed in pink and her skirt is lifted off."
2,Can't find a song,"I cannot find the song that starts when Stalone and Bly are racing in the town, and when they pass near the woman dressed in pink and her skirt is lifted off"
2,Missing the good songs,What about Filter?? This CD (missing tracks from the movie) could have been much better... then so could have the movie.
3,Special Version Of A Song,I loved the movie Driven and the last race scene was the best but i cant find a version of Era - Mother without the artist singin....I need to get a version just like the race scene. Please Reply to ASAP
3,"Many greats are missing, but some did make it onboard","As most reviews have already pointed out, Driven's soundtrack forgot quite a few great tracks played during race sequences, and that really does hurt the overall impact of the CD. They seemed to include quite a bit of the mellow songs that captured the emotional moments of the film, but failed to give us some of the notables, such as Crystal Method. One thing I will forever love this soundtrack for, is the introduction to San Jose, Cali band ""Insolence"", who's song Poison Well fit perfectly in the movie, and sounds absolutely incredible. I highly recommend the band's first wide release album, Revolution. Breakdown by Tantric is another step in the right direction, and a great track. While the songs played during the racing sequences that *are* here are great, the omissions are unfortunately vast."
3,Yet another missing track,"Another notable exception is the song ""Battleflag"" by the Lo-Fidelity Allstars (the tune when Stallone is entering the pits at the beginning of the film).Overall, the film was entertaining. It was nice to see Stallone allow the other stars to shine through, and not grandstand and take the spotlight (like some other stars have been known to do). It must be hard to be the guy (Stallone) as everyone is always critical of his recent work....."
3,Disappointed,I love this movie and the music played a major part of it BUT none of my favorites are on the soundtrack. This soundtrack has a country pop feel to it. There are some good uptempo songs but not the best ones from the movie.
3,Need help with a song,"Does anyone know the name of the song that plays during the theatrical trailer. The trailer is on the DVD of the movie. It's the one with the words ""You're going too fast,"" repeated over and over. It's got a thrash metal sound to it. Someone had mentioned Prong but I don't think so. It's not in the movie or the soundtrack, just the trailer.If anyone knows please email the song and artist to AdnanT@aol.com"
4,Looking for a track,"I'm looking for the song that is played in the USA, whenSophia knocks the brother of Jimmy.All i remember was:""Give me what you wantgive what you like... your life...""Thanks"
3,song durring the street race,The song during the street race is from the band Filter... the album No new title (I think... I have the album but in my car) It is number 5. Anyways excellent soundtrack but I am surprised they didn't put that song from filter on the track.
3,Need help finding a song,Hey does any one know the song that is playing in the background when the thing comes up that says toronto molsen indy i have no idea and love that song and would appreciate any info you could give leave a respone with toronto in it thanks :o)
3,Detroit Race music,"I've seen this question asked a couple of times and I was unsure myself for a time. The song played during the final Detroit race (when Sly and Jimmy are preparing to make their run from the back of the field) is ""Right Here Right Now"" by Fatboy Slim. It would be nice if they put this one on the Soundtrack."
3,Name of last song,"Can anyone tell me what the name of the song when Beau, Jimmy Bly and Stallone were on the winners' stage and spraying each other with champagne?"
1,One star since the CD misses the real star,"Hey! The best part of this movie, audio-wise, is in the bar where you can hear in the background ""Mad About You"" from the band HOOVERPHONIC - yet it goes missing on the soundtrack. What a HUGE oversight. This band is fantastic and I find it truly hard to believe that the music producers left the track off this soundtrack. Would have certainly given FAR more clout to the listing... Anyway, anyone interested in the song (female vocals, good beat) in the bar with the girl and guy chatting it up head to hooverphonic.com and check out their kicking music."
3,Music score?,"What is the music score when Burt Reynolds talks to Sly Stallone that he is terminating Jimmy Bly's contract?He sits in his wheelchair and talks about how Joe Tanto ""gave it all away"" and it is raining outside the garage.The background music here is awesome, does anybody know who wrote it and where on could download it?Thanks"
2,Driven Soundtrack,"Just another collection that goes along with the mood of what's going on in the movie. You'd think that a race car movie would have much more fast paced techno songs, but it it doesn't.I'd say that it would be better to single out the cool songs on the soundtrack and go get their albums. If you like raceing movies you probably like the music that goes well with driving fast (techno). So go get some BT cd's or maybe some Rob Dougan.By the way whoever wrote that comment about a crystal method song being played when they race through downtown Chicago is stupid because that's a Filter song off of their Title of Record CD called The Best Things."
2,Name that song,Does anyone know the name of the artist and song in Driven that's playing when the race goes to Germany??
2,Missing Songs,"The song that is played in the nightclub and in the final race is Poison Well, performed by Insolence. The song preceding the championship race is performed by Era, but I do not know the name of the song.Unfortunately, I don't remember the song that was done during the street race in Detroit, so I wouldn't know it if I found it. Next time I watch the movie, I'll try and figure it out and post it. Hope this helps!"
3,SONG MISSING,"CAN SOMEONE TELL ME THE SONG THAT IS PLAYED AT THE BEGINING OF THE MOVIE WHEN THERE AT THE BAR. THEY SHOW THE BAND IN THE MOVIE PLAYING IT BUT I CAN'T SEEM TO FIND IT ON THE CD. IT LOOKS AND SOUNDS LIKE P.O.D , BUT IM NOT SURE. THEY ALSO PLAY THE SONG AT THE LAST RACE IN THE MOVIE. RIGHT AS JIMMY BLY IS NECK TO NECK WITH BRANDONBURG."
2,Nothing like the product pictured...,"See the picture of the cable at top? Well that is nothing like the cable I received...A couple other reviewers mentioned it too-- its a bait and switch. The cables pictured are thick gauge heavy insulated wire and gold plugs. The cables you get are of the absolute lowest quality, tiny thin uninsulated wires, no gold plated plugs, basically the cheap RCA cable you'd get packed in with a $20 DVD player.Granted it really doesn't make that much of a difference in the end, they work, the signal gets through and if someone really cares about picture quality they would never use component cables anyway.Still the vendor needs to update their photos and description because it is deceptive and I'm annoyed that I spent money on a cheap cable that wasn't what I expected. If I wanted a cheap cable I would have kept my money and just used an old RCA cable instead."
3,Incorrect Length,"I got this because it was a good price (shipping was actually more than the product). Product works fine, but my only complaint is that the cable length is 3 feet, not 6 feet as advertised. Not going to bother returning it because of it being so cheap."
1,no good,"this product was not as described as there was no gold plated connectors and the cables where real small not the type that are usually used for component video cables. these cables where thinner than the red, white and yellow cables. Will not use this seller again because what you think your buying your not."
1,only hdmi cable gives you hi-def signal,"only hdmi cable gives you hi-def signal on hd tv's. ;these are standard cables as good as red, white, yellow"
3,"Thanks China, you're the BEST!","now I'm not saying this piece of wire is junk, it will carry a current of electricity, all I'm saying is China made this technology special for me only and I don't want anyone else to buy it and reduce me to the status of everyday person who owns a wire that can magically transmit 2D entertainment."
1,REALLY CHEAP CABLES,"First of all these cables bear no resemblance to the photo, those are $20 cables. These are seventy five cent cables, they are like string with the cheapest RCA connectors possible. Don't waste time or money on them!"
3,I wouldn't know,"I recieved something different from this seller than advertised so I can't give a qualified review, however I'll say this: This seller did give me my money back and paid my shipping costs, allowing me to keep the cables sent to me which were not gold plated and looked kind of shabby. I'd be really careful doing business with this person who claimed to be a haggered college student in an email sent to me to excuse the mistake of sending me the wrong cables."
2,Infuriating and Insulting,"I found this book, as the title would suggest, infuriating and insulting. I have been a fan of slash for many years, to the point that I am writing my Masters thesis on the subject. This book completely dismisses the fact that desire can be culturally inscribed. There is more to sexual psychology than just evolution. A case is made for what is essentially the nuclear family in ancient times. It is a logical argument, but there is absolutely no proof. Slash cannot simply be dismissed as the result of female sexual psychology, or a male/male romance novel. It is infinitely more complex, as anyone who has been part of a slash community would know. Check out NASA/Trek by Constance Penley instead."
3,Interesting,"This was gift from a friend, a fellow fan of my favourite manga, From Eroica With Love, which is mentioned in the book. While I don't recognize everything in it and feel that some parts is a bit limited, I still found it an interesting read."
4,Great instrumentals...,"Chris Poland is a truly underrated talent. His fluid guitar solos are incredible, and his playing on the 'Chasing the Sun' CD is a great example for any aspiring guitarist. I really dug his work in Damn the Machine and Megadeth, not to mention his last CD 'Return To Metalopolis'. This new CD bridges the gap between his heavy metal past and his new band Ohm, which is a jazz fusion trio. (Be on the lookout for Ohm! )"
5,Schizophrenika...,"DANIKA is one of those movies that just might require a second (or third) viewing. Like CARNIVAL OF SOULS, JACOB'S LADDER, HEADSPACE, DARK CORNERS, etc., DANIKA takes us into a nightmare, un-reality where bizarre things occur simply because we are no longer bound by our ""normal"" universe. It's much easier to enjoy this story on it's own terms (like David Lynch movies). I thought Marisa Tomei played the title character w/ a wonderful sense of paranoia and impending doom. She is a woman coming unhinged before our eyes. Or is she? I liked the non-linear style used, as well as the symbolic keys and recurring images (like the breaking glass). I watched DANIKA twice in a row. The final scene is unforgettable..."
4,Great Discussion Material - Possible Spoiler!,"I don't know if this movie has a ""correct"" interpretation of what happened. I think it is more to get people talking. I saw it this weekend and I'm still trying to figure out what really happened. It definitely sticks with you long after you've viewed it. Sometimes I thought it was just a dream, other times I thought it really happened and she was just flashing back in a confused state of mind, and then other times I think it was her sitting on a bench thinking of different scenarios of how the whole thing could have taken place. If it was real, then was the accident at the end intentional.... did she kill her husband.... what was up with the severed head vision ..... who was the lost child.....what was up with the swimming pool/dead dog segment? So many questions come out of this movie. Really a movie you want to watch at least twice and to discuss with someone else."
1,What The...????,"This movie starts out so, so and then nothing happens except delusions on the part of Danika (Marisa T.) Some reviewers say the ending was an excellent surprise...I must be really dense because I didn't get it. Sorry I bought the DVD."
2,"Maybe 2.5 stars, really . . .","The storyline had a lot of potential, but the script and acting left something to be desired. Not much of a grabber and it was kind of slow. The ending wasn't as good as it could have been - almost like, a little suspense - then flop, there it is."
4,It's actually a decent textbook.,"This book has been easier to understand than other English 101 books that are used in other classes. As a textbook, I give it a 4 for comprehension and ease of use."
4,All of the utensils are great that it comes with.,We bought this for our daughter when she was 4. She liked using the utensils but she didn't like the taste of the easy bake products. She still plays with the utensils in her pretend kitchen.
5,Makes you want to. . . .,"......meet and shake hands with and look into the eyes of the people involved with this entire production.The actors, all, the photography, music, scenery, story, make for a lasting experience. Human nature is revealed by the writer and portrayed by Duvall, et al, showing the good and bad and sweet and mean and course and tender, often combined in a single person.And then, whose name appears on screen? Clint Eastwood! What a talent he has proven to be, both in his acting ability and here for his good judgment in bringing this production together.Thanks, Clint, and Robert, and all for this fine work of art.And for those of you who want to witness human nature in action, SEE this movie. rexmounger@aol.com"
3,a good movie for the money,"This movie is a good story about a man who believes....in his land, his town and himself. Mostly he believes in oil. Finding it, taping it, drilling it, Robert Duvall is the man who can do it. How he does it is the story! I love ""little"" movies like this. Watch it and see."
1,Bad copy............vocal was a bunch of snow.,I think I would have enjoyed the movie had there been any sound. I bought it for my daughter for extra credit in her English class but now I have to send it back. It looked like a good movie. Like Robert Duval and Aidan Quinn as actors. Delivery was great. I got it in a couple of days.
4,Good enough.,"I like that the mounting flanges have elongated screw holes, so that you can position the mounting screws where they'll do the most good.I was a bit disappointed with the paint job. It looked hastily done, with just barely enough paint at the ends to cover what's not hidden by the end caps. But once installed, the bar is sturdy and looks ok.To install this bar, you'll want a stud finder to be sure you're mounting the bar securely. I installed this on a tiled wall, and a 3/16"" glass and tile drill bit gave me suitably-sized holes in the tile. Once mounted, you'll want to apply some bathroom tub and tile caulk around the inside of the end caps to keep moisture out.Now begins the test of time. We'll see what condition it's in in ten years."
5,A Quality Moen Product,"I bought two of these bars.Have not installed them yet, but they are a nice looking product.Bought them in the 1-1/4"" diameter bar size, in white color, to avoid the bulky chrome institutional look."
2,Disappointing Grab Bar,The most serious drawback with this polished brass finish is that it is too slippery. I will replace this with a bar that has a textured surface.The other disappointment is the finish. Initially it did match the existing Moen polished brass fixtures but after three weeks the grab bar faded to a tarnished appearance.
5,Grab bar,Lives up to description. Very stable. Installation instructions were easy to follow. Quality of installation screws provided seemed to be less than outstanding - worked well with replacement screws.
4,A bar,"Bought this and a !2"" bar to install in a new shower unit for an elderly person .I was able to attach them directly to the unit (hollow wall anchors)and they work great !"
1,Russell Crowe - Bad Actor,"This film is struggling at the box office, and with one good reason - Russell Crowe.Aside from being the most pretentious and egotistical man in the world, he also can't act. Or maybe he can act, but he always seems to come across as exactly the same person - the most pretentious and egotistical man in the world.I would rather scrape my eyeballs with a rusty fork than suffer another Russell Crowe film ever again."
4,It was a revealing movie of how men and women relate or don't relate to one another.,The movie was good to challenge me to think of my wife's desires and not just my own. It showed how a man's pride often breaks a wife's heart. It also showed what a terrible condition the depression of the 1930s was. I was inspired by the character and work ethic of the Cinderella Man.
5,excellent movies,Such a great TRUE STORY movie!! My husband and I watched it like 4 nights in a row!! excellent movie.
1,not happy :(,"i bought this dvd for my grandfathers birthday this year. he loves the movie and for the last few months just talked and talked about finding it on dvd since it never comes on tv. i ordered it for him as a surprise. we got it the day of his birthday, perfect timing i have to say, but the dvd skipped the entire way through. talk about disappointment!!"
4,Dreams and the Common Man,"There is very little that a determined individual cannot do. Cinderella Man is a case in point. Thought of as an 'over-the-hill' boxer, the fanciful story of James Braddock (adroitly played by Russell Crowe) is a movie which should be seen by anyone who needs a second chance in life. Director Ron Howard has revealed once again that his talent for encouraging actors to perform at their peak is still evident. The film itself is occasionally enhanced by tragic emotional segments which tends to argument the action sequences, but not so much as to diminish the overall structure of the movie. All in all, Crowe and his co-stars, Renee Zellweger, Paul Giamatti and Craig Bierko offer a remarkable segment out of the famous boxer's life and creates a landmark of excitement and entertainment destined to please audiences for generations to come. A fun and compassionate film for those with heart. ***"
3,HD DVD- Cinderella Man,"I did not realoze that this was an HD DVD when I bought it. It arrived in new condition, factory sealed, but since I do not have an HD DVD player, I cannot watch the DVD."
3,Rocky in a Time Machine,"Rocky finds a time machine and emerges as Depression-era boxer Jim Braddock. Russell Crowe plays the historical character who restarts his boxing career to feed his family and ends up heavyweight champion of the world after beating the feared Max Baer. Paul Giamatti has a great role as Braddock's manager. A solid effort by all involved, but somehow just a little too pat and too consciously inspirational."
2,"somebody up there likes him, but it sure aint me","director ron howard summons the kleenex yet again, this time in a phony movie about the depression. i dont like boxing movies; i dont like subtly anti-semitic movies; i dont like russell crowe movies; i DO like opie taylor, but go back to mayberry and stop inflicting this ""significant"" garbage on the public."
2,Christian beware!,"I was terribly disappointed that I could not view the entire movie. The constant cursing, (using God's name in vane) the brutality and hatred portrayed. If this is a ""slice of old fashioned Americana"" than we are indeed in trouble. Wholesome? I hardly think so!"
4,You want this man to win,"I wasn't sure how much I would enjoy it because I'm not a fan of Russell Crowe. He's a good actor but he's such a creep in real life. Also, I'm not a fan of boxing. Yet, I tend to like boxing movies. Go figure. :^/Well, this movie had lots of heart. How can you not like an upstanding person that James J. Braddock was portrayed to be? He loved his family and he tries so hard to keep his family feed and off the street during the Great Depression. It was important that his family stay together. You want the man to win."
4,"""I've come to pray for Jim.""","Based on the true life story of Depression Era boxer, James Braddock, Cinderella starring Russell Crowe as Braddock is a heartfelt and stunning achievment in cinematic history. Renee Zellweger plays Mae, Jim's wife, who stands by him no matter what. In the beginning, the couple and their three small children are happy, healthy, and rich but then the Great Depression strikes, their world is turned upside down. They are forced to live in a tiny apartment, they power is turned off, and one of their children is taken ill by lack of nutrition. The only reason I can't give this film 5 stars is that Cinderella Man can be slow at times, some of the boxing scenes are kind of boring but if you are a guy, of course you'll love those scenes, but overall, the film is classy, enchanting, and inspiring. Crowe and Zellweger are perfection together. Too bad this film wasn't recognized by the Academy, rent or buy this film today."
4,Quick and great condition!,Arrived very quickly and was just like new. Great for my History classroom when we are studying the Great Depression right before Christmas break!
5,A great underdog film based on fact.,"Personally I thought this was a great film for both women and men. Russell Crowe is outstanding as Jim Braddock and Rene Zellwiger is at her best as his supporting wife. The film has a great mix of action and romance with some great cinema photography, making it easy to believe your looking back to that era.Over all, the film has a great pace with very little if any in the way of lag time and I was brought into the career of this Sports Icon even though I knew or basically knew the ending. The acting across the board is outstanding and for me it is one of those films I can watch maybe once a year and am glad to have it in my library."
4,Slightly overbearing but still good,"You have to expect ""Cinderella Man"" to lay it on thick considering it was directed by Ron Howard. But it is a surprisingly engaging movie despite being overly sentimental in places. But it's still worth a rental if you haven't already picked it up.The one fault I saw in the movie was the attempt to make Max Baer the movie's villain. The real Max was far from the surly braggart you see in the movie. From all accounts, he was a good natured, likeable person who never took himself (or anything) too seriously. The claim that he ""killed two men"" in the ring is only a half truth. Consider that deaths in boxing were far more common back in those days and that only one man died in the ring at Max's hands. The other man, Ernie Shaff, died in the ring versus Primo Carnera, possibly as a result of an injury sustained prior to the bout. I feel the demonization of Max Baer added an unecessary Hollywood touch to an otherwise likeable and realistic yarn."
1,Waste of money.,I do not have nor could find a dvd player to play this format. I had to repurchase a different format.
5,An uplifting movie,"The movie is artfully and well done, and the acting is very good. But the great thing about this movie is it's story. In that it is a story about an actual character and is historically based, it is even more impactual. Movie gives a great look at the depression time in our nation's history. I highly recommend the movie."
4,A truly inspirational story told exceptionally well on the big screen,"Anyone who thinks that Russell Crowe doesn't deserve an oscar nomination for this performance should watch the movie again!This is a truly inspirational story - made ever more inspirational through the raw and beautiful way the story is told both by exceptional direction and a stellar cast. Russell Crowe is at his best and his performance only confirms his exceptional talent and total discipline in being 'at one' with his character. The fight scenes are shot magnificently making the viewer feel as though they are actually in the ring! Renee Zellweger' character and all the other supporting characters are well developed throughout the film, with again an outstanding discipline from the actors and raw reality. Such a well made and thoroughly thought provoking film. A definite oscar contenter in my view."
4,cinderella man,good movie. we enjoyed it very much.recomend to everyone.It is a has a good ending.good story.well written.the family enjoyed the acion.
5,TAC Forec Soft Gun Case,Great case for the money. It is very well made. I will be buying another one. Solid product!
4,Good case.,"This is my second Tac-Force product and the quality is on par with the first. This bag is sturdy, has good quality zippers, and seems well thought-out. The velcro straps inside the main compartment are movable allowing you to configure accordingly. What's nice about the description of these bags is that the dimensions listed are the internal dimensions, so if your long gun is exactly 42"" it will fit in the 42"" bag. I would give it five out of five stars if it were made in the U.S."
4,A good FINAL Review of your knowledge,"I found this book benificial for me since it gave me quite good idea on my TOEFL score. It coantains 5 actual tests and 1 extra test that coantain a sealed questtions and ansewr sheet the same way on the paper based test. Excellent for Paper based but only Good for the Computer Based test. Though this prep kit dont give any further explanation on Eng so u should have a good knowledge of english before using this guide, since it only help you know what to expect on the test."
5,"Wonderful, insightful information - detailed to help people live powerfully","Diamond LightThis is one of the most insightful books. I loved hearing Ms. Starre's words from her experience with Master Khul. The history and the future along with the present provide tools for living fully, powerfully and positively in our world today. Again we hear how powerful the realities are that we are creating with our thoughts. It's the Secret and then some..."
4,Works well,This product works well and has a pleasant taste unlike regular throat lozenges. Also helps with indigestion. Can recommend it.
2,They don't last,They taste great and that is why I gave them a 2 star instead of a one. More like candy than a throat lozenge. They crumble instantly and dissolve in your mouth immediately. The effects last for about 5 minutes. Don't waste your money-go get Hall's Menthol Eucalytus instead.
1,Slippery Elm Lozenges,Don't waste your time or money. Shipment was not on time (although they charged my card immediately). I suffer from a very dry mouth and am constantly trying new things for relief. This isn't it...not even close. The lozenges have the consistency of cardboard...which really doesn't help dry mouth suffers.
4,Wahl 5 star,"Good clippers. Strong motor. Wahl clipper attachment could use some heating to bend plastic ends to stay on better. Stays fairly cool, cuts through thick hair great"
5,Best Clipper Ever!!!,"I already have a Wahl Senior, but wanted to try the v9000 motor so I ordered these.The power is amazing. It also ""opens"" much more than any other Whal. The fade blade was kinda pulling on my beard area, so I took it out and put a regular blade in.Im now selling my grey Senior. All Wahl has to do now is fix their attachments."
2,Not that great. Runs HOT!,"I just bought one of these clippers. It gets very HOT. The ""cool running"" description is wrong. This isn't any better than the cheaper Wahl adjustable clippers. I paid too much.But I've tried other clipper brands over the years. Wahl clippers are the only clippers I use. They are the best. But this one being advertised as cool running is false advertisement."
3,"Overall, good. Cheap guards.","It's like Wahl put a team of mechanical engineers on the clipper design and then had the intern design the guards. There clippers catch hair between the stationary blade teeth and the plastic guards. I might be able to modify them a little, but damn it hurts when they catch! I paid good money so that I wouldn't have to fix this.. The clippers themselves do look and feel very solid, like they will last a long time though."
2,Not the worst cd in the world,"Who am I kidding it's the worst noises i've ever heard, yes i said noises it's not even songs. PLEASE don't buy this guy's recording and maybe he'll stop torturing the world with stuff no one but a few pathetic losers want to hear. By the way some of the tracks make cool unique ringtones!"
4,This is a pretty amazing video,"Incredible footage of nature set to music that generally complements what is being watched. The only reason I would not give this five stars is the director's fascination with close up shots of the eyes of animals. Some may enjoy this, but I found myself dismayed at the use of caged animals when wild animals in nature are so much more compelling and interesting. This is worth seeing, however, if you enjoy either nature videos, documentaries, or somewhat experimental video."
4,Great but short.,"Went looking for this after listening to the original music elsewhere. Not an easy DVD to find (you also wouldn't believe the other ""Anima mundis"" out there!) - quite expensive for the very short running time. But it is good and worth it if you like this sort of thing."
4,"A good, short work","A comment was made that this film is derivative of Koyaanisqatsi, which is a silly and ignorant statement at best. Anima Mundi covers a completely different subject: the diversity of life on earth, where as Koyaanisqatsi was a reflection on the affect of technology on nature. Anima Mundi has no time lapse photography and Koyaanisqatsi has no animals. They are quite different. Yes they have the same style, but why should a film maker be blasted for having a distinct style? The footage is striking and it is very well put together. Much of Philip Glass' music actually isn't instantly recognizable as Philip Glass music. It's short and not as evocative as Koyaanisqatsi and Baraka but it's a fine piece on it's own merits. The DVD could be better quality... the dark shots have some unfortunate digital artifacts... but the brighter shots look quite nice."
2,Am I missing something?,"I have read the other customer reviews that praise this DVD. In fact, that is the only reason I bought it. And now I am left wondering what I am missing. I have seen it twice and still can't find the genius in this production. I am sure the raw footage was breathtaking. However, the clips are too short and the editing doesn't seem to flow. The music is overbearing and unnecessarily focal, as if the director is depending on the soundtrack to lend coherency to the film. Give me National Geographic's stock footage library and a Mozart CD and I'll make a better production than this."
3,poor quality hurts this film,"This film is good, its not the best though because at thirty minutes it really cuts its self short. Sure its a short film, but the subject matter it is trying to deal with just can't be properly covered in thirty minutes. Even so its worth a watching,but too bad the DVD is poor in the visual quality. Glass is great with the music, as usual. The film Microcosmos and the film Baraka are actually better films in dealing with nature.Check them out too."
4,"Henry A. Rider, Jr. , President, Process & Quality Consultant","This is an excellent source. It is a practical reference for anyone establishing, maintaining and/or developing an organization. This book is a quick read that is enhanced by effective use of case studies. The information contained is contemporary and includes details of search methodology. The sample forms and checklists are a good starting point for the practitioner. It is evident that the viewpoint of the writer is that of someone that is experienced, ""hands on"" and operating in today's environment. This book is a solid addition to your technical library."
4,very good photos/ by donna hunnicutt,"I did like this book although it gets a little draggy. lots of history in this and maps to show what is where today. the Toe river is a beautiful place with some fine fine folks still living there today. they are great neighbors, willing to help out and this OUTSIDER from New York made a place for herself by making friends, learning new ways of doing things. would buy this book again."
3,Just what you'd expect,"Decampitated! is just what you'd expect from a movie of this title. It's packed with cheesy gore, token nudeness and all-out camp. If you're a fan of the Toxic Avenger, Blood Hook, Class of Nuke 'Em High and the like, you won't be disappointed. If you're not a fan of the previously mentioned, however, might want to skip on toward Remains of the Day."
2,Haha *yawn*,"So it was funny, I guess. The point is that they're all stupid, and we get to kind of have fun letting them be stupid and run around the woods. I get it, I should say... fun! Yeah...I don't know, I think a few things in this were pretty creative, mostly the different type of stuff the killer did and the whole side-story involving the transvestite. I also like the references to Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Deliverance (at this point, can you even have a killer woodsman story without said references?). Also, the whole duct tape thing was a great motif.I actually think the funniest and most interesting part of the movie was the credits, though. Wardrobe provided by Wal-Mart. Yeah, good stuff.--PolarisDiB"
2,Take that Friday the 13th!,"Troma is an amazing film company. I can understand that most people would get offended at the films, there are sometimes over the top. This film was not as good as it could have been. It was funny in some areas but didnt hold together well. The soundtrack when the killer was around was funny but other then that, the movie was not that speical. The ending was stupid."
1,Extremely weak and flawed.,"I'm a big fan of vampire movies, but this was a complete waist of my time. I know it was made on a low budget, but that doesn't mean the story has to be weak and flawed, and the the story is extremely weak and flawed. It tries to be funny, but the jokes are flat and the whole AIDS connection is pathetic, come on, don't you know a vampire is all ready dead, he can't get AIDS. The direction was 3rd rate and the acting grade B at best. I'd say if you want to see a vampire flick, rent anything but this."
2,Cheezy!,"For a horror film, the thought of a hunter skipping through the woods doesn't really scare me. The fake blood was a bit much. I think that I saw atleast three gallons of it through out the duration of the film. If you just want something to laugh at, this is your film. But it is an embarrasment to all horror films."
5,Perfect companion to the book!!,"My children (3&6) lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ve this DVD & all the games / activities that go with it! This is their favorite story!! And they actually share & take turns with the controller! This system is great because the controls are simple enough for the 3-yr-old to use (sometimes he's happy just turning the page & hearing the story), and the games & reading on your own practice are engaging enough for the 6-yr-old. If you have the Read With Me DVD System, I highly recommend this DVD!"
5,Read with Me,"This product is not only educational, but an excellent choice to do together with your child. You two can read the story, play other activities, and learn words in the story. It has a fun vocabulary in this particular DVD that kids like. You have to be aware that it must be played on the Fisher Price Read With Me DVD system."
5,Toddler loves this one!,"My toddler enjoys this Fisher Price Read With Me DVD very much! She asks for Chicka Chicka Boom Boom frequently. She learned to match her capital and small letters at age two using this system. It's easy to operate--she runs the system herself. She watches the story one time through, then goes right to the learning games every time."
4,Diverse Pictorial,"Bus fans may be a litle disappointed as buses get scant coverage. This is essentially a heavy truck book, with a few fire engines, off road,and army vehicles thrown in. American trucks dominate and White and Western Star are particularly well covered with several examples. There are a considerable number of older English and European trucks to add flavor. An alphabetical list of truck pioneers and their accomplishments is an interesting addition.With only 65 pages, one cannot possibly hope to end up with a comprehensive book, however this example carries considerable appeal because of its excellent choice of illustrations."
4,The Ape IS High,"From the first track to the last, this is a compilation well worth listening to, despite poor mastering of the disc (""Hang Loose"" mix is particularly bad). Few band's have mixed the energy and groove quite like Mandrill since their heyday. ""Fencewalk"" and the eponymous track are also noteworthy."
3,BE AWARE OF BOTTOM LOAD SONY CAMCORDERS,"Before you buy a Sony Digital 8 bottom load camcorder be aware of Sony's engineering flaw. When you use their camcorder on a tripod one should know that in order to install or remove a tape you have to 1. remove it from the tripod then 2. unscrew that tripod adaptor. Otherwise the tape compartment will jam against the tripod adaptor when it tries to open. A lot of wasted time and energy here! Unfortunately, I did not discover this flaw until my 30 day Circuit City return window had expired and Sony will not allow me to return it to them. Their help???desk informed me they are aware of this problem but have no fix and that this problem exists on all their Digital 8 bottom load cameras."
5,Each cranial nerve in detail,"I wish I would have found this book earlier! It is an excellent resource for neuro/anatomy.It maps out each cranial nerve, explains its course, functions, etc. in clear text. I liked how it had a different color for each modality (general sensory afferent, branchial motor, etc.) and how it explained areas in which there are differing opinions; it helped me to reason things out when texts/professors conflicted.Thank goodness a kind soul handed this down to me, because I think $43 is a bit steep...."
2,The phone battery eventually doesn't cut it...,"One of the problems with these kinds of phones is that manufacturers will cut corners with the battery or recharge mechanism to get a lower price point. As a consumer, what you think is a great deal turns into a paper weight far too rapidly.I have had this phone for under a year, and the handset starts to fade after being out of the cradle for 10 minutes. After 1 hour on standby, it is likely that it will not be able to communicate with the base station, or it will not transmit your voice well.Lastly -- the UI for setting the clock and other settings is terrible. You can't do it without the instruction book. I give that a design grade of: F-No more sony phones for me. I have had lots of luck with wireless 900 mhz phones by GE however."
3,Dropouts are a problem,"This is a really great phone except for two problems. (1) Occasionally when a caller leaves a message on the message machine, dropouts (no sound) will occur. This happens if the caller's voice is quiet or the connection is poor. We returned the phone because we were missing so many messages. (2) To get 18 minutes of recording, sony compresses the voice messages and so they sometimes come out garbled and difficult to hear. Also, the outgoing message isn't very loud to the caller and they frequently ignore it.Other than that, this was a really great phone."
3,The phone is excellent; the digital answering machine poor,"The Sony phone/answering system we purchased has the caller ID on the handset itself. The phone is the best phone we've ever had. However, the digital built in ans. machine is the worst. It is very difficult to understand what people said because it is very muffled and ""digitized."""
1,Poor product all around,"The handset volume was too low; all conversations had to be turned up to be heard, even in a quiet room. The handset was not clear for either party. Sounds were ""clipped"". The recordings on the answering machine were unintelligible and had to be repeated several times. The message counter only indicated new messages, so there was no way to gage how many old messages might be on the machine without playing them. The beeping tone indicating new messages was nearly inaudible. No backup battery in base to keep settings in case of power outage. And, lastly, it was nice being able to perform any answering machine functions from the handset on my last phone; no such feature on this phone. At least the handset wasn't so small it couldn't be held or cradled between your cheek and shoulder. I returned the item to the store from which it was purchased and am awaiting a new one to try."
4,"very reliable, gives lots of distance from terminal","Having this phone is not about being able to see how far you can actually walk away and not get static sounds when you are too far away. The service that it gives with the digital messages is what amazes me the most. I can quickly breeze through any any and all of my messages and erase them even faster. If I choose to I can turn the ringer off if I choose not to take calls and the message machine picks up, recording messages for as long as 18 minutes and the memory has a capacity of any where from 36 to 54 messages capacity. I highly recommend this phone and hope that you enjoy using it as much as I have."
1,"phone doesn't work, not reliable, expected better from sony","The phone seemed great, answering machine had problems with cutting off parts of message... after 1 week, battery just wouldn't work, even though phone had not been away from base cradle except for actual phone calls. Replacing battery at my own cost did not fix. I returned item as faulty and would not recommend it to anyone."
3,Don't drop it,"The phone is great, but with it has one small problem. Whenever you jar the base of the handset, it drops the call and must be returned to the handset. Otherwise, it is a good value and high quality."
1,Save your money,"The quality of this phone is bad, even by Sony standards. During a call, the background noise worsens and will render most conversations inaudible. As others have noted, the answering machine will not record messages from quiet callers.Apply the cost of this phone to one of the more highly rated ones, otherwise you'll pay twice - once for this piece of junk and once for its replacement."
5,Hey Chel you know it's kind of funny...,"But you still sound freakin awesome after all these years. This new edition is the best. That voice still breaks my heart and the extra cd makes this worth every dollar. Chel, keep writing and singing."
3,Not for everyone,"Obviously everyone else here loves this album, but as a more mainstream listener (take that however you want) it's a little crunchy. If you're looking for stimulating writing, here it is, but if you want a catchy tune, look elsewhere."
5,Easily One of The Best Networking Books I've Ever Read!,"It is my pleasure to endorse, without reservation, Ken Marsh's book ""Fearless Networking."" Each year the Houston Business Show endorses a handful of books as the best for business. It is safe to say this timely book will be on that list. It is empathetic, diagnosing the barriers to successful networking and helping the reader overcome such. It is practical, giving the reader step by step approaches to being successful. It is encouraging. Everyone who reads will feel able to succeed. It is easily one of the best networking books I've ever read. If you are in sales, buy it. If you are a sales manager, buy many! This is the book you and your team have needed. Thank you for letting me read your great book!Kevin Price,Host,Houston Business Show, AM 650Publisher of Houston Business Review"
5,"The A, B, C's of networking in one easy to read book","Did I read the whole book? No. Did I read most of the book? Yes. Was the information helpful? Yes. Will this book help anybody who is in business? Yes. I can't believe I scanned a book that is one of the most helpful non-fiction books I have ever read. This book asks question all of us have, answers questions we have about business and networking, gives a quick summary of the answers, lists objectives and gives a plan of action to follow. This wonderful book is now distributed to all new members of Horizon Business Network (Stafford-Houston, Texas). Thank you, Ken Marsh, for a book that gives us all the A, B, C's of successful business networking.Jeffrey L. NovyPresident of Horizon Business Network"
3,easy to read but disappointing,"I picked up this book as a preparation for the CLEP marketing exam. While it is easy to read, the layout is cluttered and distracting. The authors give a rah-rah treatment to e-commerce, presenting multiple .com case studies throughout the book (each chapter begins with an internet site and description).It is clear that the authors were infatuated with the so-called ""new economy,"" and the book suffers a lot as a result. Using it as a primer is tiring, as you have to separate the essentials of marketing from the e-commerce cheerleading.The publisher's website does have quizzes to test on the material, which I like, but overall, I was still somewhat disappointed."
4,Cool Songs!,"Circle Square Triangle (Album Version) is easily the best song in this album, wish they would stick to this kind of style because their voices fit right in with this particular style. But overall it is a solid album; hope they continue to produce some more. Also if anyone knows how to get in contact with these guys; Let them know to put their latest stuff on Last.FM I and the rest of us will be listening."
5,"How to conduct research for such instruments, and the pros and cons of their contents.","Karen Grannum and Nigel Taylor's WILLS AND OTHER PROBATE RECORDS provides insights from the experts at the National Archives, and while this holds a British focus, many researchers from other countries will find it invaluable. Those whose ancestors have roots in the UK receive chapters on how to conduct research for such instruments, and the pros and cons of their contents.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
5,aqua jogger,"very glad to find this ,for non swimmer it gives you confidence to to go in deep water and exercise."
4,Water Running Belt,"I have owned this belt for approximately two months. It has held up to regular aqua walking and other water exercising. It is of a good quality, and the belt is sturdy. The height of the belt is perfect for a 5'2"" person, but I can't comment on any other heights). I feel that it provides superior support and it keeps me afloat while exercising. This was a solid purchase for me."
4,Great questions,"The brightest quality of this book in the depth and the importance of the questions that it makes. But, it doesn't give the answers that the reader needs. Nevertheless the book is very good and the references to the pop music songs spreaded between the events of the story make the book very agreeable. (please excuse my english)"
5,The prophet of the 30 something generation,"After reading the 'other' books by Coupland it is impossible to say he's only got talent. He is a writer that will, hopefully, be here in the next years to help us see how we really are. Coupland started with Shampoo Planet and Generation X and made us believe he was only a bright kid who wrote about his fellow kids, saw the birth of the net generation, the crisis of yuppies and the birth of techies who highly valued not only technology but also feelings, relations and, behold, family (Microserfs). Now he is the speaker of a generation approaching the age of 40, with no more values, no energy, nothing to believe in, except maybe, and still, friendship. His analysis of what we are couldn't be better. Bravo!"
4,What a great read!,"For me, the old adage ""I didn't want it to end"" doesn't apply to too many books. It did to this one, though, partly because I figured that whatever else he'd written, it wouldn't be quite like this. (and, so far, I've been right.) This is my first Coupland novel, and I came across it completely by accident. Part of its pleasure for me comes from a familiarity with the locale -- old stuff, probably, if you live in NY or LA, but a little novel if you're from the Pacific Northwest. I love his use of metaphor and imagery, in fact this would make an excellent book for a college course on ""Imagery in Fiction."" He's created a number of characters that you really do care about, and he clearly cares about them as much as you do. The story is completely gripping, though the denoument is a bit weak. Buy this book today!"
2,Like Eating a Mars Bar with the Wrapper on,"In short, a thorougly disappointing read. Can do better Douglas, especially for one so keen to point out the mercantile nature of society. What happened to your ideals man?"
4,Sounds familiar? Wake up call for many of us.,"This is an easy reading book. However, its content is very interesting. It gives us the chance to wonder how are we doing things, how we are about to become. Do we really care? Or we only care about ourselves. Watch out, this book gives you the chance to consider how you're doing things. Great book, deep insight."
4,scared the bejesus outta me,"Being thirty something and having lived in North Vancouver this book really scared the bejesus out of me and thats why I give it 4 stars. I guess I can identify a little bit with everyone in the book. Otherwise I'd give it a three as Coupland's preaching for meaning in a post-modern world is a little bit too evident from the outset of the book. Enjoyable, but not in my ""best list""."
2,"Good idea, pity about the finish.","The first two-thirds of this book are an interesting take on relationships and growing up (and apart), then, as the book should be working towards its climax (when the girl awakes from her coma), it all suddenly starts to go downhill, like the ski slopes alluded to throughout the book. The final third of the book descends into a second-rate and positively idiotic Stephen King-type end-of-the-world pastiche, with much introspection and contemplation of navels. (And King does this a lot better, being a pro fantasy/horror writer.) At times it reads like the last part of a different novel altogether! I interpret this last third to mean ""What is the point?"", which could pretty well sum up the book as a whole. I think I'll give my copy to a jumble sale."
2,Commits the worst of literary crimes... Wasting its promise.,"GIAC is a book that you should not read. It wastes your precious time when you should be preaching on the purpose of existance. Or so Coupland would have us believe.The first hundred pages or so are at times exciting, mysterious and above all filled with potential. What happens to a clique stuck in a hick yank town with nothing to do?Of course, they do nothing. Who needs plot, pace or invention when you can have boredom, apathy and rot? Not Coupland anyway.Trash the book, and go out and do something with your life. That, after all, is the novel's predictable message."
2,"big build up, big let down","Being an avid reader of Coupland, i found his latest book to be a real dissapointment, but i still recommend it to any Coupland fan...just check it out from the library instead of paying for a hardcover book. Girlfriend in a coma has the regular Coupland characters but an alien story line. <It's the end of the world as we know it, and Coupland does an awful job of ending this book. By the time you are into the third part, the narration gets so bad that it is painful to read it.All in all it's a good idea but i think he could have done a better job developing everything..."
1,Want to Read Some Coupland? Read Gen X (again),"It has been said that this book is a departure from Coupland's usual work. This is true. Was it worth the trip? I say no. Books like Generation X, Microserfs, and Shampoo Planet are clever and ingenious looks at today's society. This book is not. It reads like a recycled young adult horror novel. It doesn't have the same spark as his earlier works. Furthermore, the ending is really, really lame. Really cheesy. I know that reviews won't stop the curious, but if you're wavering about spending the money on this hardcover edition: don't! Wait for the paperback if you must.... Better yet, skip it entirely."
1,"Overated, selfindulgent, depressing - don't bother","I was really disappointed with this load of tosh masquerading as deep thought. Coupland's view of the future as seen through the eyes of a bunch of now familiar slackers is grim. It doesn't help that there isn't a single sympathetic character to empathise with. The novel veers all over the place, unsure of where he's going Coupland sends us into the realms of the bizarre. Some may consider this novel clever and insightful, I consider it the most pretentious book I've read in a very long time. Is there no hope for humanity? Not while this guy's still writing."
1,Possibly the worst book I have ever read,"I read this for a book club and I am embarrassed to say I finished it. The writing is plain, too obvious, and juvenile. Even if I had been able to enjoy the plot, the writing made the reading experience painful. I do not recommend this book."
1,Someone... please... help!!!!!,"This has got to be the worst book I have ever read!!! OK I will admit me wasting my money was my fault because of the interesting cover (white with the barcode and title on each cover). But uuughh, if this isn't the worst book ever. It started off very well with the first 46 pages, then the book got stupider and stupider. The plot sounded interesting with the idea of a girl being in a coma for 18 years, but as the book went on, it became the reader that's in a coma. This is the first, and probably the last Coupland book I will ever read. Avoid."
1,disappointed,"i really like douglas coupland, but i didn't like this novel it is the only one though the rest are all 4 or 5 stars"
2,Read Illusions by Richard Bach instead!,"If you want to read something to inspire you, pick up Illusions by Richard Bach instead.Also, Coupland listened to The Smiths entirely too much before he wrote this book-- Morrissey's lyrics are all over the place. Very silly!"
3,"Geez, quit clubbing me with the obvious","I've thought of Douglas Coupland as a wonderful, insightful author since Gen X. He basically, described everyone I knew in that incredibly smart novel. On the advice of a friend, however, I waited until Girlfriend in a Coma came out in paperback. Glad I did.It's not that this is a terrible book, but Gen X and Shampoo Planet and Microserfs are just so much better. And so much less preachy. There are some nice ideas popping around in it. Having the main characters all working for the X Files is sort of cool, but, geez, populating the novel with every late 20th century sort of addiction/mental problem (alcoholism, heroin use, co-dependency, nasty Goth nihilism) is heavy, heavy handed.I was ready for the novel to end 70 pages before it did. Most of the time with Coupland I'm upset that he didn't write more."
2,Wow--a staggering disappointment.,"I'll be brief--I have loved almost everything Coupland has ever written. The earlier novels, the short stories in _Life After God_, the magazine articles I am lucky enough to track down, and of course _Generation X_ (a book I must have worked, somehow, into almost every undergrad English paper I wrote). _Girlfriend..._ literally saddened me as I read it. No great Coupland characters to latch onto, a disturbing shortage of the memorable phrasing and epigrams that made him such a delight to read, and (most distressing) a cop-out, lame ending--I have always defended Coupland to skeptics by saying that if nothing else, the man can construct beautiful conclusions--always moving and poetic. I finished this novel out of loyalty to Coupland and hope for better next time--the only value of the book for me now is as an example of ""spot The Smiths lyrics Coupland's inserted into the text."" That was sort of fun, I suppose...sigh..."
1,"Starts well, descends into sci-fi ...",This was the first Coupland book that I've read and it will probably be the last. I loved the first 100 pages or so of the book but after that it seems to spin out of control. About half way through it starts to read like one of Stephen King's trashier efforts and I lost interest. Just too unbelievable and contrived. Very disappointing.
2,Morally bankrupt,"Coupland can write and he has a great premise for the novel, but he doesn't know what to do with it because at heart it seems he's got no more clues than your average Joe Schmo about what is going on with life and how to make it work successfully. It's ultimately disappointing. Don't set up a structure if you've got no way to resolve it (which is what he did in this book)."
3,two books in one,"Unfortunately this books greatest strength is, probably its biggest failing. The first half of ""Girlfriend"" is classic Coupland. You cannot help getting wrapped up in the lives of the characters, even if about 18 years skip by like a stone. I got so involved with the characters that I forgot that I knew what was going to happen... and then Coupland decided to become Stephen King, throwing in the modern equivalent of the ""sea change"". As a literary device, this makes you re-evaluate the characters, and completely alters the timber of the book. There are merits to this, however it completely disrupted my reading. I was content with the way the book was going before the change. After it I felt like I was being preached to about the evils of modern society. If you like Coupland AND Stephen King, you will probably like this morality play. If you like Coupland you will love the first half... as far as the rest, you are on your own."
1,one star is one star too many!,"An insult to our generation. The characters are all bunch of losers and I don't care what happens to any of them. If they are all that's left of this world, we're better of dead! Let the cockroaches rise and dominate the world. The only good thing about the book was that it was SHORT!"
1,a waste of my time,"this book was a complete waste of my time, the beginning waspromising,the end extremely dragging and disapponting.i wish i would have been warned beforehand, and i dont thinkthat douglas coupland deserves to be among the list of writerssuch as chuck palanhuik or brett easton ellis, who i believe AREthe true genuises of this era."
3,A great start but fades towards the end,I have enjoyed all of the author's books but was a bit disappointed with the pat (almost I can't be bothered to keep writing) ending to this novel. I really enjoyed the characters and cared about what happened to them but I just found it a bit difficult to suspend my disbelief with the ghost scenes. Having said that it has made me take a look at the things I am doing with my life in which case I guess it has served its purpose.
2,Could have been better.,"Girlfriend in a Coma began as an interesting novel, but was a disappiontment at the end. At first, the novel seemed to touch upon the sensitive issues of dealing with a loved one in a coma. For example, the drastic differences in the ways Richard and Lois dealed with the loss of Karen. The plot took a nice, fairy-tale kind of turn when she wakes up after eighteen years, but after that the story takes an unbelievable twist, with ghosts performing miracles and people falling asleep...everyone but the main characters. An even greater twist is when a character is impregnated by the ghost. All in all, I felt that the ending was feeble and could have been better. However, the questions that the author posed are very thought provoking and should be considered by everyone, because there is truth behind it all."
4,Almost a great book,"In some ways this book was better than I expected from Coupland. I've enjoyed his previous books, but found them a little to glib. In this novel, I felt that he retained his distinctive brand of storytelling, but with a deeper insight. The first part of this book was fascinating, even when things got pretty weird. In the third part, it really strained my credulity, but I was interested in the purpose of all the strange events. Unfortunately, in the end I was disappointed. It was like lighting a firecracker, anticipating the big ""BOOM!"" and getting a little ""poof."" The final revelation just didn't impress me. Maybe it's a sequel and the anticlimatic ending is just a jumping off point for an even stranger trip for these characters. Overall, I still enjoyed the book, and look forward to his next one."
2,Mediocre effort from an author who can do better.,"I was disappointed in this book. I really enjoyed Microserfs, but I was bored by his more traditional approach with Girlfriend in a COma."
2,"Good start, disappointing ending","This book raises a major question- ""What makes human existence worthwhile?"" - and provides a fairly unconvincing answer extremely unconvincingly- ""Constantly asking questions.""This ""question"" is part of the ""story"", so when the answer begins to seem like a failure (2/3 of the way through), so does the book."
3,Bizarre long tale to get to a point,"The point Coupland makes is profound. It should be, that is Coupland's schtick. Like most of his books, it focuses on the power of story line. However, this book seems to fall short on believablity. Unlike Gen X, Microserfs and most of all Life After God, you have to strugle to relate to the characters. If you are a big Coupland fan read this book. If you are new to him read Life After God and Generation X first."
4,What did I get myself into?,"My sister purchased this book when it first came out, and after she read it once it sat on the bookshelf for years. It was not until I went home during the Christmas holiday that I decided to grab the book and see what it was all about. The title alone lead me to believe that was a sappy, Oprah meets Nicholas Sparks novel that would attempt to tug at my heart strings.What I soon discovered was this book was not what I expected. It was better. I have such trouble decribing all that is in this book, and feel that i would short change the reader by divulging any plot twists, turns, or even a synapsis. This is the type of book where the less you know about it the better. I can honestly say that I wish I could read it again for the very first time. Enjoy"
3,"Shoplifters of the world, unite and take over!","I have a soft spot for this book, which is not one of Douglas Coupland's best, owing to its tireless catalogue of Smiths lyrics. The title, obviously, but I think I counted something like 38 direct references to Smiths songs in one run-through, including the double whammy sentence ""Golden lights oscillate wildly,"" which had no seeming context except itself.The plotting of ""Girlfriend in a Coma"" is quite good but the characters fall short: they're half-formed - which is good, in a way, since the novel covers such a long time period - and not all that interesting to begin with. Also, do you have to throw in a fifteen year old crack addict pregnant with her drug-dealer's baby? How about a light touch? Yes. Softly. Will the world end in the daytime? I really don't know. Is there any point ever having children? Oh, I don't know..."
3,"A Good Start, but Dull Ending.","The first part of the book is excellent fiction writing and kept me entralled, but towards the end of the book Coupland becomes too obsessed with his philosophies and fails to maintain his characters' credibility. Are we really to believe that the average person would be willing to act like a looney street person all in the name of meaningfulness? It's reminicent of cult behavior to me."
2,disappointing and puzzling,"I have to count myself among the other Coupland fans who were disappointed by this book. I've anxiously awaited everything Coupland's written since Generation X and was frustrated by the delay of this book (it was supposed to be out last fall). It was really not worth the long wait. Coupland's uncharacteristic descent into the Twilight Zone in the second half was interesting at first, but was so lamely concluded that it just left me wondering what he was thinking. I also found the characters pretty thin, and while I enjoyed the pop culture banter of the characters in his previous books, I was somewhat annoyed by it in this one, though I'm not sure why. This book just didn't reach me personally like his others have.I recommend that Coupland fans wait for paperback or hit the library for this one. I don't recommend it for non-fans."
3,not a good intro to coupland,"there is something about this book that left me wanting, expecting more.....an avid reader of Coupland's books, I expected a bit more, i expected the characters to go somewhere else, to get beyond the tricks that are Coupland's.....to show that he, as an author, has grown.....By the end of it all, I felt like I was just following yet another person's view of the Zeitgeist......fun, hip, frightening, and desperately in need of soe serious analyzation...."
2,What happened?,"I love Coupland's books. What happened with this one? The last half of it fell apart at the seams. If you've read all his other books, you'll want to read Girlfriend In A Coma. If you've never read anything by Coupland before, don't start with this."
1,Ugh,"Enjoyed (with qualifications) Coupland's earlier efforts, but literally couldnt pick this one up again after the first chapter, which featured the clunky device of a dead high school football star's narrative. It read like a parody of Coupland's style. Maybe I should have given the book another chance, but I didnt hold out much hope after such a poor beginning."
3,Read this last.,"At best, this book is preachy and strange, at worst it's a response, published as an afterthought, to a stoned, shoe-gazing dare.You have to know going into it that this is not a good book. If you have never read a Douglas Coupland book before, stay away from this one. If, however, you have an affectionate fondness for Coupland, if you've read all of his other books and you find his struggle to reinvent a moral vocabulary *before*it's*too*late* absolutely adorable, then go for it. This book is like an eccentric aunt, and should be appreciated that way."
3,unusual commentary on the meaning of life,"On December 15th 1979, on the night after they first make love, Richard's girlfriend Karen goes into a coma. She wakes up 20 years later, mentally undamaged, to find her friends relatively unchanged (they seem t have just grown into their own expectations of themselves) and that she and Richard have a teenage daughter.And just as she starts to recover, the rest of the world falls apart.Yes, you do have to suspend disbelief, but it's worth it.This is an unusual, original book with a unique storyline and an interesting (if somewhat clichéd) cast of characters who are searching for their meaning of life."
1,irritating. awful. failure.,"this book is MISERABLY BAD. the first half is ok...but the second part is so terribly, off-the-wall, ridiculously bad that i couldn't even finish it. the characters are supremely one dimensional. the story is boring. the actions in the second half are cartoonish and, frankly, insulting. it sounds like something someone wrote in a high school creative writing class. i hated every character in this book. it is now at the bottom of a cage full of mice being torn apart for nesting material. i guess it's good for something!"
3,odd little book,"This book starts with a 17 year old girl (Karen) going into an unexplained coma the night that she loses her virginity to Richard in 1979. However, the night she goes into a coma she confides to Richard visons or dreams of the future that she doesn't believe she should be seeing. Just weeks after entering into the coma it's learned that she is pregnant. After giving birth while still in the coma to a healty baby girl, the narratation goes into the lives of Richard and his friends who seem to drift through their 20s. Karen awakes 20 years later to a world she doesn't really know how to react to and can't help getting the feeling that the end of the world is near (I won't give anymore away). The book is interesting enough, but doesn't always keep me reading, because I don't always care about the characters. The ending of the book was also a disappointment. Overall, the book is a quick read and does have its oddly funny moments and version of the appocalypse that makes you wonder."
2,So disappointing after Generation X,"I guess I went into this one wanting a continuation of Gen X or at least something as exciting, edgy and bitingly cynical. But alas, I couldn't even get through half of Girlfriend in a Coma. It was depressing and the plot seemed watered down to me. But PLEASE read Generation X!"
2,"I love Doug's writing, but not this one...","i love doug's writing; i've seen him read twice (i saw him earlier this year in his first public appearance since his self-imposed public exile) and read all of his books. but his latest attempt falls so short in plot development, the reader is left wishing she/he didn't taint her/his view of doug by buying _girlfriend in a coma_.i wish mr. coupland would stick to doing what he does best: observing the world around him and describing it through his ironic characters instead of subjecting his readers to a superfical, moralizing ride through a bad science-fiction tale."
5,"Girlfriend in a Coma, a great book for us Generation X'ers!","Douglas Coupland did a great job writting this story. He looks right into Richards thoughts and delivers a ""movie-like"" story that most X'ers would enjoy. Its was easy to follow from start to finish. I haven't enjoyed a good book like this since I was in high school reading ""The Catcher in the Rye"". Also The Smiths song ""Girlfriend in a Coma"" softly wrisped to me in my mind over and over again as I read though the chapters. The book overall was really kewl (cool)."
2,******************WHATEVER!!!!!!!!!!********************,"Girlfriend in a coma is really good at the beginning, but as for the end was just plain weird. I thought from reading the first 150 pages this was a book about love, relationships, commitment and romance, but just 50 pages further got into some really weird stuff on how Karen, the girl in the coma is the center of a ""mass transformation"" and the she knows about it. It has to do with a disease that random people get by sleeping, it really doesn't make any sense. I was really enjoying the book for the first 175 pages, but I just got lost at the end and don't really understand what this sudden coma/disease/mass transformation came from."
4,Coupland attempts a call to arms...,"Having just put down Microserfs before I started this, I can say GIAC is very different, not as easy a read. Much more of a fable, it seems his attempt to really rouse his readers rather than just leaving us sitting in our comfy chairs saying ""wow, I am as empty as those characters."" So read it, think about it, and listen to its message."
2,Gen-X dribble,"Let us look at this clearly...Machines control our lives and emptiness fills our lives. Sure, whoop-de-doo, it take a very deep and critical thinker to see that in our modern world. I felt he oversimplified the modern day lives and events. To top it all off there is a ghost, from the main characters past, who performs miracles and a coma vicitm who sees the future with three paperbags over her head. Honestly, do I need to say anything more?Needless, to say this book was uninspiring and uninsightful. Maybe because I dont long for the late seventies that I don't mourn the wonders of feathered haircuts and down jackets.Instead, pick up a Milan Kundera book. Don't waste your time with an early nineties fad...gone bad."
2,Plot spoiler (kind of),"I was so upset by this book, which starts out with quite a nice, easy story. Not particularly challenging, no new questions asked, but still well written. I even liked the post apocalyptic bit.It's just that I can't believe that a great author like this could seriously use the ""it was only a dream"" story line. Even before coming 'round from unconsciousness, the final message to never stop screaming meaningless pointless questions at people is a ridiculously oversimplified solution.I really liked the start, I think that's why I feel a bit bitter about it. He made me care about the characters, only to do stupid things with them.Two stars is for making me care, otherwise it would have been less."
4,Tiramisu to go- Delicioso!,"Each and every flavor of Loacker's Quadratinis I have tasted are delicious, but this one takes the cake...or should I say, Tiramisu. These heavenly little bites of wafer and cream really do have the flavor of Tiramisu- that creamy declicious Italian dessert. The creme has a sweet light coffee flavor with vanilla and chocolate undertones, and maybe even a hint of amaretto rounding it out. The creme filling is always the right consistency, and the wafers are always crisp, never stale or soggy in texture. Additionally, by purchasing them in bulk from Amazon, you get a much better per package rate than buying them from a specialty store. Finally, Quadratini stands for four layers (of creme and wafer), so add these many details to the fact that these cookies are in the form of a cute little cube, and there's no way you can resist these delightful and delicious treats from Italy."
1,sylvania dvc850c dvd/vcr,This unit stopped working about four months after I purchased it. The labor warranty ran out after 90 days. A real piece of junk.
4,great buy,This is a great deal for only 99$. I bought the same piece from best buy for 150$. I currently use it in my dorm room and its great. It is easy to use with all the controls located on the remote. A steal.
1,don't pay more than $50,I bought two of these in November of 2002. The power went out on the first one in june of 2003. The power went out on the second one today 2 Feb. I am single and live alone and work 12-16 hours. I do not watch enough tapes/dvds to have the power go out. They did not last a year and a half. shop around on some of the reviews before purchasing.
1,You get what you pay for.,"Within 6 weeks of purchasing this item, I could no longer record TV shows as the audio no longer worked. I could not return it to the store so I called Sylvania and was told I would have to send it back as it could not be fixed. What a piece of junk! I can't wait to buy a new one (which will NOT be a Sylvania model either!). We could not turn the timer on or off using the remote either."
1,This Unit Keeps VHS in Business,It's a good thing that the Sylvania DVC850C has a built in VHS player since you will need it when after three months both the DVD player and warranty expire.
4,Still Going Strong,"This player isn't flashy, but very functional. After 4 years of use, we have had zero problems. Simple to setup and operate and has good features - excellent given the price."
2,Timer recording and calendar dates buggy,"I purchased this unit as for my secondary TV. I have had problems with the dates matching the days of the week and wrong number of days in a given month (often shows 31 days for months that only have 30, etc.) when setting up timer recording, causing shows not to be recorded. At first I thought this might be a bug because 2003 was a leap year, but still persist in 2004.I have also had problems when changing recording times for a show set up to record Monday - Friday where the unit will not record the show. Had to delete the timer program and start over to correct this."
2,Listen to a mature musical perspective before you buy,"After reading the multitudes of flakey A+ reviews, I decided, against my better judgement, to give ""Up"" a second, third and fourth chance. There's no way out; this has to be one of the most disappointing CD's of all time. Disappointing, because PG is, without exception, the most talented artist of our time. He totally missed it this time. There are, in fact, only 3 good listens on this CD, and one of them is a repeat. All the reviewers who suggested this album deserves a second listen or that it should be ""an acquired taste"" are fooling themselves or maybe they're fooling us. I don't normally waste time writing or responding to reveiws. I only hope PG reads this and the large numbers of other C-/D+ reviews and notices before he goes back to the studio."
3,"Admirable, but not that enjoyable","I'm like the other reviewers here: Bought it the moment it was available to add to my comprehensive Gabriel collection. I admire ""UP"" for its fragments of beauty. I just don't think it has legs. Some of the refrains are dull. He's got so many projects underway in his life; I don't think this CD has his best ideas. He falls back on way too many of the same old tricks; anybody who has played his music will recognize the same musical syntax. The production -- with its usual synthesis of computer-enhanced rhythms and distortions -- is a bit busy. Maybe the tour will get him back in fighting form."
5,Brilliant,"Peter Gabriel has produced one of the most amazing albums I've ever heard. Everything about this album works... from the songwriting to the arrangements and instrumentation, to the musicianship. The songs expose the dark side of the man and the world in dramatic and vivid fashion, just like you'd expect from someone as deep and somewhat twisted as Peter Gabriel. They draw you in to the point of total absorbtion. I can't do anything else while listening to this. From dramatic and almost overpowering to subtle and soft, you'll be spellbound.This is not a peppy album, and it shouldn't be played at parties! If you want to hear some truly groundbreaking music, however, I can't recommend this album enough. It's stunning."
3,"Lyrics have depth, but music is dated","On UP, Gabriel delves deep into the dark places of the mind and soul. The overall sense of fear, depression and despair is almost palpable. His lyrics are some of the most personal and moving he has ever written. So why 3 stars? Musically this CD would have sounded inventive and dynamic...5 years ago. The industrial sounds and jarring dischordant shifts have been the base for a number of bands, particularly NIN, for years now. The world rhythms that Gabriel had so well incorporated in his last few recordings are nowhere to be found on this CD, and that creative loss is felt. Too many songs drift off without any real effect on this listener (Ex:""Sky Blue,"" ""My Heart Sounds Like That, ""More than This""))until you focus on the lyrics, but the best Gabriel music has always been a blend of aural and mental stimulation and this CD does not hold up to the standards Gabriel has set for himself."
2,"""Up"" by Peter Gabriel","I think I own all the major studio albums of Peter Gabriel, and this one is the worst. I like a couple of the songs, but I have listened to it several times and still don't ""get"" most of it. Fortunately, it didn't cost much."
3,Warm when not calculatedly cold,"Up feels like much of Gabriel's esteemed but overshadowed solo career,itself a study in ex-frontman artistic integrity. Here the artist provides another satisfactory album of dark, layered pop with plenty of shimmering moments, and a few wholly organic pleasures, though rarely strikes solid gold primarily due to an over-labored vibe churning along to dull electronic flourishes I can only guess represents Gabriel's slick but untrue continued relevance as hipster-godfather."
2,lost the plot,"Along with every other Peter Gabriel fan, I've waited a long time for this. Unfortunately it's over produced, depressing and lyrically goes nowhere.Do yourself a favour, pull out ""SO"" and relive old memories instead"
4,The drops point,"we were waiting 11 yeras and we have it - a great colection of a typical Peter Gabriel that we love.full of sadness,emotions but also hope for better days...music is amazing,he combines industrial rhythms with techno pulse,world music and often pop and rock.the result is perfect and rich album.but why 11 yeras of waiting?"
5,PETER GABRIEL IS RESURRECTED ONCE AGAIN,"One critic said that on Security that you do not just feel the music...you live it....such is the case with UP. Again Peter Gabriel had proven that art rock is not dead, but in the Latin sense, a living corpse. From the onset the music is an onslaught on the senses and the juxtaposition of all around us. Again incorporating haunting sounds and melodies, this album is rich in it's amorous envelope of a myriad of sound, texture and voice...such as we have become accustomed to over the years. Peter Gabriel can afford to make albums every ten years because each track is more than well worth the wait. Just listen to ""Growing Up"" to prove this right....also...the European mix is completely different for those who want a bit more of the exotic. Very recommended by this listener......"
3,Buy the Barry Williams Show single instead,The second disc is just the Barry Williams Show single with the Album Version omitted. Save your cash. Unless you're a completist.
5,"up, up and away...","ok, this is an amazing album. i'm a musician and big fan of radiohead, sigur ros, etc. I bought this album without hearing, based on knowing that my dad loves this guy, named Peter Gabriel. I put it in and was in love with it immediately. It's one of my favorite albums. it's so patient and genius, and ""the signal to noise"" wakes you up at the end, only to send you off into peace with ""the drop"". I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys listening to music, not only having it on as background music."
2,"""No Triumph With This One""","I thought this one was not up to Peter Gabriel's norm of 'splendor.' so sue me. ""Gabriel's"" voice in this one was lacking his usual range, I thought. Too many twists and unexpected changes for me too enjoy fully. I know from this review it doesn't sound much like I'm a fan of Mr. Gabriel, but I am...usually...just not with this one."
3,"slight disappointment, but still good","I'm a huge Gabriel fan. If there's a tape of him singing ""Happy Birthday,"" I would buy it. His voice is incomparable. I waited years for this CD and bought it the morning it came out. Much of it is thrilling, simply because it is Gabriel's voice, but compared to Us, So, and even the earlier stuff, it's a bit disappointing. I believe Peter got bogged down in the studio, fooling around with different sounds. This album is overproduced. Nonetheless, beautiful melodies creep up on you all over the place, and it is full of honesty and emotion. If you're a Gabriel fan, it's worth buying. If you simply know Gabriel through ""in your eyes"" and ""sledgehammer,"" then you might be disappointed. This is more of a return to his experimental, edgy early solo years (the album is closest to the PG 3, or ""melting face"" album)."
3,Disappointing actually...,"Once you get over the initial excitement of a new PG recording in years, its easy to be blindly willing to except the work as ""great"" or ""masterful"" but the sad fact is that he's done better. While there are some genuinely great tracks, I came away underwhelmed. ""Darkness"" is disjointed and largely unlistenable (c'mon admit it...). I love Peter Gabriel's music as much as anyone but maybe its time to look at what else he's doing with other artists and ventures."
5,A Worthwhile Effort!,"Finally!... I was absolutely blown away by the first 3 tracks. However, I was disappointed to see Gabriel recycling some old music! ""I Grieve"" was on the City Of Angel soundtrack from a few years back. A fabulous tune! Also, he recycled some music from the ""Long Walk Home"" soundtrack as well. The songs do not lose continuity but are very much a perfect grouping. Overall, the details in each song are characteristic of the perfectionist that Gabriel has always been. Despite the 10 track listing, there is plenty of music, something like 70 minutes I think! Buy it and enjoy!"
5,Will Make You Remember Why You Enjoy PG's Music,"It has been too long since Peter Gabriel's last ""proper"" album. As I write this just a week after its release, there are already 140 reviews of this title. He's been busy these last 10 years, but this is the album the world has been waiting for during that time. They should not be disappointed. It has a pace to it that is very effective. The high point for me is ""I Grieve"", a memoriam told from the perspective of a victim's loved one. My 9-year old can't stop singing the chorus to ""The Barry Williams Show."" Fans who came on board with ""Sledgehammer"" should like that track. Anyone who has ever enjoyed Peter Gabriel's music will remember why after listening to this album. (Also available in a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound version--very sonically interesting.)"
4,Not a great but good cd,"This is a good cd from peter gabriel. My favorites on it are Darkness, No way Out, Sky Blue, and More than this. It is very techno in some parts which is good in some parts and not in some areas. It is very keyboard oriented cd with not too much guitar in it except for a part in No way out (good sound too)and it is also a very somber cd most of the way through. It gets a little strange in signal to noise. It's a cut above US but I still like 1, 3 , and So a little better than this cd."
5,"Complex, nearly visual music","You have to admire Peter Gabriel,he experiments with sound, emotions, and melodyuntil it's nearly visual.His latest effort, Up, is a return to his complex,sometimes angst-filled music, that somehow remainsrhythmic and melodic.This recording, especially when compared to his other efforts,reveals what you get when someone capable of pop hooks, dark melodies and film soundtracks interweaves them all together.I've listened to it repeatedly since I got it,hearing new things each time.Well worth buying."
5,Are you a Peter fan?,"If you are like me, a true Peter fan, please don't think it twice. Enjoy this CD in a dark room and relax"
4,He's baaaaack...,"It's been quite a while since the last Peter Gabriel album. 8 years? 10? A looooong time. The man has not lost a step. That being said he hasn't really moved forward either. But when you're talking about Gabriel, that's not a bad thing. He's been ahead of the pack for years and if this album sounds a good deal like his best work from past albums so what? He doesn't need to grow. I LIKE him the way he is. It's been worth the wait, it's a phenomenal album. All Gabriel fans must buy."
5,Simply amazing,"This album by far is my favorite of Peter Gabriel's. All the songs just hauntingly beautiful yet beware, it is about the darker, more secretive part of human life. This album is about life and death. About sufferring and vulnerability. Most songs are dark and chilling but then, there is always light underneath all the desparation. I highly recommended it to people who has been through a lot and needed an outlet. You will feel liberated through his music."
2,Boring,"The least effort possible must have gone into this album. Boring, boring, boring. All sounds the same. If it wern't for Tony Levin this would be a 0 star."
1,For Peter Gabriel fans only,"My better half and I really enjoy PG's work. We think that he's one of the better artists of our time.We own most of his work (including Genesis, solo and Soundtrack material).Regrettably, we bought this CD too.This disc is to be avoided. It is, quite simply, a profoundly unpleasant listening experience."
1,UP - YOURS !,...The record is also very repetitious with endless keyboard padding that leaves the listener who thirsts for Peters inventive energy & melodic/rhythmic hooks starving for a melody or something to grab on to ....
5,Thank You Peter,"Spiritual, Emotional, Passionate, Creative, Honest.I'm glad Peter Gabriel is still with us. We need him. The Music World needs him. We need many more like him."
3,His voice is just soooo slow!,He has lost his bar music skill and it just drag on!! He needs to stop smoking.otherwise his music is fun!
4,Mixed reaction,"It is really a weird cd, I still dont know what to think about it. I know one thing for sure, I seriously hate ""Barry show"" song. Its so trying to be popy like ""Sledgehammer"". My favorites are ""Signal to Noise"", ""Growing Up"", ""No Way Out"", ""More than this"". BTW lyrics are weak, especially for somebody who liked PG I-IV."
2,Not Too Deep,"The Barry Williams show is most catchy tune on this album. It would appaer to be radio friendly, only, even the hack station programmers that run commercial radio in this country know enough to realize this song, lyrically, is about 10 years belated."
5,DID YOU KNOW ?,"This CD is the crown to my top three favourites of 2002 !The other 2 are Porcupine Tree ""In absentia"" a phenomenal CD .Tempano "" The agony and the ecstasy"" ,a monster discovery for me ! , I'm still speechless.I waited 10 years , Please Mr. Gabriel , do not keep us waiting here for so long ......... again."
4,Up in the air,"Many fans are on either side of this album. Its a good album, but it is very dark & not very uptempo. If your looking for another Sledgehammer don't bother. There is ""greatest hit"" material on here. Like Growing Up (my fav), Barry Williams Show (good lyrics), Sky Blue (an extended version of somethings found on Long Walk Home), I Grieve (if Steam was the sequel to Sledgehammer, this is the sequel to Dont Give Up), & More Than This. Darkness also sounds like what Peter Gabriel 3 would if it was made today. There are alot of good tracks here but listeners may not like the slow pace of the album. I do. But lets not make it another ten years for the next one please. This tour he rode a bike, next one he might sing from a wheelchair...(sorry PG)Also recommendPeter Gabriel: 3/MeltPeter Gabriel: SoPhil Collins: TestifyGenesis: Lamb Lies Down On Broadway"
3,not my favorite,"This album was not what I expected, its good but not a mood-enhancing listen....I just bought it, and as it was playing a door blew open and I nearly jumped out of my skin, that is the kind of music you find on this album. There is a lot of beutiful music here also - it is sort of a cross between the last redemption (?) of christ and older harder peter gabriel."
5,Up,"Here is an album that can stir the soul and uplift the spirit as only PG can. The album moves from one amazing track to another, until ending on a plaintive, haunting note in 'The Drop'. Songs like 'Sky blue' which features The Blind Boys Of Alabama and 'More than This' move me so deeply every time I hear them that it is almost impossible to express. His biting observations of reality and chat show TV are noted in 'The Barry Williams Show' and although this is my least favourite track on the album, I respect it for the message it is trying to give. As typical to PG the lyrics are inspired and the music builds in emotional force on each track and throughout the album. A great album, my personal favourite of all of his work, and that's saying something as his back catalogue is incredible as well!!!Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
3,A new Peter Gabriel Album after UP,"This SACD mix sounds so different than the CD version it is amazing. Specifically, Growing Up is a different song in SACD, and much darker than the original. This is NOT my favorite Peter Gabriel album by far, but is is worth a listen to what mixes he has added for SACD. It is a complete remix. Now I have to buy the other ones while I still can. Can't wait to hear Security!"
4,Up,"Up being Gabriel's 2002 and his 7th studio album is a very experimental and avantgarde release with tracks such as darkness, Sky Blue, I grieve (which was written in 1998 and had nothing to do with 9/11) to mention a few. The cover of the booklet has drops of water falling. I have no idea what it is supposed to represent. The rest of the album is filled with strange and confounding photographs. Each picture has a nice list of whom played on each track and what they played. However we do not get any lyrics and that is not so nice. 4/5."
3,Not his best,"I am writing this first as a huge Peter Gabriel Fan. He is my favorite artist and I have seen his last 4 tours. Although I wouldn't be without this release, I can't recommed it to newcomers to PG music. I would start with Security or So. This is a quiet album for the most part, with some musical elements that reminds me of some Beatles music(Sgt. Pepper), actually.I may enjoy it more over time, like most of his albums, it is not immediately accessible."
2,He's dug in the dirt all the way to china,"Some thoughts:Chris Squire of Yes once said the key to a good album is a clear emotion. This album is way too complex, dark, and narcissistic for my taste.What makes Peter's music so interesting is the dynamic tension between manic ""shock the monkey"" songs and depressive ""blood of eden"" songs. There is no dynamic tension here, it's all depressive.Also, David Rhodes, Manu Katche, & Tony Levin are as important to the ""Peter Gabriel"" band as Peter himself. There is very little of their spirit on this album."
5,Nothing more to say...,"Pure genius, everything I've heard from him is masterful. My only problem is deciding which I like more ""UP"" or ""SO"". Absolute undeniable musical genius."
2,"After 10 Years, I Expected Much More Than This!","A very disappointing effort. After ten years of writing/recording and with 150 songs to choose from, it is hard to believe that Peter Gabriel edited the list down to these 10 rather uninspired songs. Overall, the release sounds dated and possesses none of the production values that kept Gabriel's work on the cutting edge of music. The lyrical content and mood of the music can best be described as dark and depressing. In my opinion, the ten years between ""Us"" and ""Up"" were not worth the wait. ""Us"" will remain one of my favorite albums of all time and ""Up"" will be buried somewhere in the deep, dark recesses of my cd library."
3,"In the right direction, but....","I feel Gabriel is at his best with haunting material like PG3 and PG4. Half of this disc sounds like leftovers from US (ie. the incessant layers of gated world beat percussion that makes every song sound the same). The other half is the preferrable disturbing sounds. So in that respect, kudos to Peter for a rather uncommercial effort."
2,"""Up"" it isn't.","This is not the album I expected. There is no joy to be had on this CD, literally. It is slow and melancholy, as if he were creating some sort of musical requiem for 9-11, with only a couple of exceptions and even those aren't very uppity.A real disappointment considering the time PG took to deliver this album."
3,This is what happens when you take 10 years.....,"...to get an album out the door. There is no doubt that this is not for the ""Seldgehammer"" fan, but being a long time fan of PG, and world music, and the bad music but interesting genre this was a real disapointment. I'm sure all the artsy types will give it high praise, the ""innovative"" videos are out the door already, but I wish there would have been something a little more here from our friend Mr. Gabriel. My feeling is that there is no warmth to the delivery, nothing subtle about the music and the lyrics are basic at best.That being said a mediocre album from PG is better than most, so it will get play time. I mean he could have at least provided some text on the liner notes or something, talk about burning the fans...."
4,Peter the Great!,"Beautiful. Moody. Haunting. Forward thinking. Forward looking. Intelligent. Moving. Still an artist to be reckoned with. I cannot wait to see these songs performed on his upcoming tour. I get chills from this cd's beauty as I listen to it. Thank you, Peter."
4,Pretty good music--but copy protected,"I'll leave the music reviews to everyone else here, but you might want to be aware the CD is copy protected, so you can't rip it to you computer-very disappointing."
5,"Vintage Gabriel, for better or for worse","This is the perfect album for the hard-core PG fans who thought So and Us signaled a sell-out. It won't do much for his more casual fans who prefer his greatest hits. If you enjoy listening to one or more of his first four albums from start to finish, then buying this CD is a no-brainer. If you only bought the first album for Solsbury Hill, the third for Games Without Frontiers and/or Biko, or the fourth for Shock the Monkey, you may want to think twice before shelling out the $$ for his latest offering. If you only bought So for Sledgehammer and Us for Digging in the Dirt, fuhgeddaboudit."
5,Best Book in the field,"The book really brings an in depth analysis of the modern financial world, through a very simple and easy to access method of presentation. Good for students, interesting for any other reader..."
2,Not the correct book,"The picture shown for this product is of the correct book and edition, but the one that was mailed to me is the international edition...not the book pictured. International editions are usually at least slightly different than the normal version (pictured)."
1,Who wrote those reviews? I find the missing identity to be suspect.,I don' t think it is any better than other texts and I just want to balance out the overall rating average by giving a low rating.
4,Usefull,"This is great for lying in the lake with a nice cooler filled with chilled drinks, cup holders a little on the tight side"
4,Perfect for floating,"I used this tube cooler 3 times this summer and it worked great! It holds a 10-12 cans with ice. The only thing it's missing is a dry pocket on the outside. The only down note I have is it retains water in the canvas around the air tube (not in the cooler itself), so when you take it out of the water it's really heavy and needs to be drained. Kept our beverages cold all day long."
1,"Should have returned, but didn't want the hassle","My biggest issue is that the label is stamped on upside down! Otherwise it's just kind of weird. Strange zippers and compartments that I don't see any use for. I should have returned but I didn't want to bother, it still does the job but it's not what I expected!"
4,Cooler serves it's purpose,I bought this cooler to ship to my sister's house in Arizona for when I arrived with my other sisters for our annual sister's visit. It arrived the same day we did and she was thrilled with it. It is very convenient to have your favorite beverages floating around the pool with you especially when that is where we spent most of our time. It was deep enough to hold about 8-10 cans/bottles with ice and it chilled them very nicely. It was easy to use and stayed inflated for the entire week that we were visiting. I'd recommend this product for purchase.
2,Its okay,This would be worth the money if it were bigger. You can only fit a limited number of cans with ice. Without ice you could get about 12 cans.
2,Not very functional,"This item filled with water, was a maze in terms of unfolding the material to change from carrying configuration to floating config and generally didn't seem to be a good design. Not a bad idea and I can tell they put some thought into it, but just not functional (for the pool anyway.)"
5,Very durable,Cooler was better made than expected for the price. Also we were able to place about 10 beverages in the cooler with ice. The cooler floated down a 6 mile river raft ride (pretty mellow class 1) kept everything cold and came away with no damage.
5,One of the best purchases I've made online!!!,"This cooler is amazing!!! I was looking for something like this for a real long time and the wait was worth it, just think about being inside a pool or the beach and you don't have to get out to get your beverage (works incredible with beer bottles) or a refill. It holds up to 6 bottles or cups in the cupholdres, so there's enough place for your and your buddies drinks. The cord is really useful to get it around your wrist so it won't get carried away by the tide.An awesome product for anyone who likes the outdoors fun in the water and the price is a bargain."
5,Best Floating Cooler Ever!,"This is the best floating cooler ever. We go to Mexico (Rocky Point) each year and have always wanted a cooler that would float out in the water with us. This cooler stayed afloat the entire time and kept the content cold. Plus it was easy to open when floating out at sea. (We also had the big Bobber with us, and that cooler filled up with sea water, plus it's impossible to open when your on a float.)"
1,Stones fall out,I purchased this for my mom. The stones quickly started falling out. She replaced it and that one also lost it's stones. She has another one in the flower design with different colored stones and it's fine. Not sure what it is about this particular charm for June.
1,Poor quality item,"I received a used-looking product that had a sales sticker from Bed, Bath, and Beyond on it. The plastic packaging was open and the inside paper packaging was ripped and thrown about. The AC connector does not seat into the product properly, which could be an electrical hazard. The sound is very tinny. I do not recommend this product. My kid has an older version of this product that works better than what I got."
4,teddy / body suit,"Bought this to be a Playboy bunny for Halloween. It was nicely made and comfortable. I had to put straps on it, but it still worked out great. It looked like a really bunny outfit!"
2,Short in the waist,This outfit looks good on the model but it was very short over all and the legs are cut low and unflattering... the leg cut doesnt seem to match the picture.Not sure who could fit the outfit. Maybe somebody with a short waist.
2,Not what expected,I thought this outfit was classy and pretty nostalgic like a pin up or something.. That's why I bought it and that's what I was going for..but... Idk.. I expected the material to not look so cheap... it fit nicely but I wish I would've purchased something else...
1,wrong picture,"I bought this toy because it looked like it might be difficult. The problem is, the picture looks NOTHING like the actual toy. The toy was super easy, it took less than a minute to solve. I'm really disappointed."
4,Ugh! - 'Metaustart' (Elektrohasch Records),"Good, straight-to-the-point 'stoner metal' from this trio that comes from Munich, Germany. Saw noted on the inlay card that Stefan Koglek of Colour Haze guests as guitarist on two tracks here - the wailing ""Hermetic"" and the tripping ""Cubicle"". All nine cuts are well played and all but the tunes that I favor are ""In Vain"", ""Fatburner"" and the heavy-duty ""Terminus"". Line-up: Sony-bass & vocals, Martin-guitar and Tim-drums & effects. Should do something for fans of Nebula, Motorhead, Sleep, Spirit Caravan and possibly Monster Magnet."
5,Easy reading and to understand.,"Although I am already a Christian, I enjoyed reading all aspects of Christian living. I would recommend this book for anyone wanting to learn about Salvation or others that want to witness."
4,"Bathtub Gin, Bootleg Liquor and Speakeasies!","This is a very good example of a noir detective story. In it we meet a lot of real people from the Roaring Twenties entertainment crowd. The mystery is sketched around Rudolph Valentino's death, but we see the real people that lived in and around his circle. It is clear that Baxt knew some of these people since he writes about them as an old friend might. He has a witty, breezy style, and he perfectly captures the way of life of Prohibition New York. The story takes place in the summer of 1926, just a few days afer Valentino's sudden death. We meet Dorothy Parker and the rest of her Algonquin crew as they join forces with the cops to solve the murder of a dead showgirl. There is a lot of organized crime in the story, and we get a clear picture of how they operated, the front men that they set up and the way they dealt with traitors. (Even cement shoes show up in the book). I really enjoyed this book, and Baxt is an accomplished writer."
3,Great idea but not the best product,"I just had a baby and needed protection from the sun and a comfortable chair to nurse in. It is pretty comfortable but the canopy is a bit of a pain and when the wind blows, forget it. It hangs in front of your eyes and blows down in your face. You feel like you're in some sort of space machine. I'm not even sure this canopy has the UV protection it claims, the nylon was pretty light and I had to put another blanket over it to establish some shade in my spacecraft. Also, whenever I got up to take a swim, the chair would blow over. I had to put my bag in the seat so it would stay in place. I love the concept and the backpack part was very convenient but overall, this chair didn't work for me."
2,Construction problems,I already own and love two similar chairs from Kelsyus but the two I just bought failed within hours. The pockets that connect the arms to the aluminum bars blew out on both arms on both chairs. My old chairs with the black web seats are great. Would try these blue fabric chairs again if people posted that they were not having problems with newer ones.
4,Great for the beach,"I purchased this item for a beach trip and it definitely delivered. Carried it on my back with no problems and it held up well.Two things to note: Some of my friends got similar chairs that reclined. This one didn't. And while the canopy is nice, it's not the easiest to fold back up to go in the case."
5,Concert goers,For out door venues this is the best purchase I've made. Comfortable and keeps you in the shade (or out of the rain for the most part).
2,Broken in 20 minutes.,"Great concept, but has some quality flaws. The arm rests (which also serve the backpack straps when its folded-up) broke/tore within 20 minutes of use. Quite a dissapointment, as I generally like the chair. Given the price of the beach chair, you would expect better quality. I will try to fix it myself with some sewing, as its not worth my while shipping it back. In terms of comfort, its OK, not great, but not bad either. The one drawback with the canopy is that if you are of average height (I'm 5'11) you head will be pushed forward by the canopy. The one plus is the backpack feauture, which make it easy to carry, and is not too difficult to figure out (they could use better instructions). As far as weight, its a bot heavier than other beach chairs out there."
2,too thin,I thought this was a little heavier than it is....seems kinda chintzy. I'll be more careful the next time I buy it.
3,"Hard to Read, Yet Harder to Put Down","In the future, Elvis Presley has become a religious figure. Like all events in history, certain details have become distorted over time. Agents time travel back to the Fifties to find the original Elvis in an alternate universe and kidnap him. Author Womack has done his homework, and he clearly is an Elvis fan. His details are based on real events found in any Elvis biography and his insights on Presley's behavior are accurate. Unfortunately, ""Elvissey"" is written in a style similar to ""Clockwork Orange"". How can you go to the next chapter when you can't be sure you understood what you just read? If the language had been simplified, this book would have been incredible. Most people will probably give up after the first chapter, but I had to find out what happened. If you like Elvis and Science Fiction, get this book."
1,Elvissey Drowns In Words,I only wish I had read more reviews. I read a review of this book in a magazine and search diligently to find a copy of it. You can imagine my delight when it was here at Amazon.com. My delight turned to a headache as I had to read over and over and over the first three chapters only to come away with a vague idea of what was occuring. As I lover of all William Gibson novels I can handle a future world and accompaning vocabulary. Mr Womack could I have a dictionary or something? Your expertise in a whole new language was skillful but I'd still like to know what happened. Sounded like a great idea. I loved A Clockwork Orange and it had a strange dialect as well. Don't buy this unless you have finished graduate study in Chinese and need something new to learn. Bummer.
2,Thank god it was so cheap!!,I found this paperback in the bargain box at a bookstore. Now I know why. I was intrigued by the premise of the book but from start to finish I couldn't get into it. The abbrieviated dialogue in this book was more painful than anything I've ever read. It was like reading Yoda's shorthand! Written normally this book may have been a good read as Womack has some interesting ideas about the future. For Womack fans maybe but not Elvis worshippers.
3,Read Her other books first,Tourist Trap is not Julie Smith's best book but it still ain't bad. Her heroine is a bit too dithery for my taste and the plot is not as tight as it should be. Read New Orleans Mourning or True Life Adventure-they are both great books.
3,Another case of American Jewish gender confusion?,"Audition For Murder (Morgan Taylor Mysteries)O Sacred Head (Fred Taylor Mystery)If I hadn't just read mysteries with a hard boiled actress and one with an art historian,I probably would not have realized the detective / lawyerin this novel is a male in a female body.That's probably why this novel fails besides it's strange days for months fortimeline. If the gender of the two main characters is exchanged( newsman and lawyer) the plotline actually works better?I wonder how many other mysteries start with somebody nailed to a cross?"
2,bleh,"You think i could learn after my first Bloodfart Lake. I think the first was even better.... Yet again we get the pathetic commercialism by now 2 of the actors promoting their crap during dialogue the chick on the cover i guess is some softcore porn star trying to promote herself, so go buy her other videos today.... and of course more promotion for selling T-shirts again. I thought that Meredith Host would make this one better, but i didn't really like her role this time around; being all whiny and annoying. Nudity? No i don't recall any this time like in the first so even the soft porn chick keeps her clothes on, but she'll tell you about her stardom. It has it's mo9ments but not enough to save it."
4,Movie is full of funk and spunk,"Childish, no.... infantile movie with low low lowbrow humor. An abomination. By no means a skilled endeavor in filmmaking. But hey, I like that sort of thing when done well, if not skilled. The infantile wit had me in stitches, just like the killer scarecrow has. I hope this movie doesn't inspire me to do the deranged deeds that he did! If you like perverted humor and low budget killing and gore, Chris Seaver's films are some of the best! Return to BFL is excellent entertainment!"
4,GREAT HELP,I've been wanting to add this to my bag for quite some time now.I haven't gotten to use it but am excited when that time comes.
2,Too much for most photos,Used it on a recent photo tour of Italy and maybe one out of 30 shots were good enough to save and use. It is simply too much ND.
3,Great pictural content but technical data can be improved,"As Bill Yenne emphasizes at the introduction section, the book is solely about UAV projects of USA. The book covers up to date information by the time of its creation (2004).Attack of the Drones contains excdellent pictures of several UAVs of USA. It may be purchased just because of the picture content. But some of the pictures are not synchronous with the text, i.e. picture of a UAV may be seen a few pages before it is mentioned in the text.The book claims to mention every project of USA (I write ""claims"" because I am not in a position to verify the coverage). I think more technical information could be provided, perhaps with some tables summarizing properties of the vehicles.Although not perfect, it is certainly an enjoyable book to read, and it can be used as a reference about history of USA UAV projects."
5,Awesome for CHILDHOOD albums,"This book has ideas for use with children in documenting their lives as they view it as well as for the adult who is backing up and documenting their own. I am always amazed at this author's ability to take it to the next step in my own thinking for scrapbooking. This book does not have as many PHENOMENAL layouts as you find in her BOOK OF US, but it is created by children, who generally are not the artistic creators like you find in magazines or other idea books. Instead, she has hosted a place to see where your own children can go with layouts and gives ideas for the scrapbooker trying to recapture their own childhood."
3,Davis Does It Again,"Mike Davis's political writings focus on Latinos in Los Angeles in this book. Of course, this book NEEDED to be written given how Latinos were largely absent in his CITY OF QUARTZ. I agree with the reviewer who says there is nothing really new here; Davis repeats a lot of what Latino scholars have already said (check out his footnotes). On the whole, a decent introduction to Latinos in urban contexts."
2,Does not seat well on presta,"The construction is nice and works for schrader and presta but I cannot get my road bike tires to the correct psi. The valve seating is convertible to presta and will get you about 80% of the way, but it's very hard to keep the presta open AND push more air into the tube. I am grown man and certainly strong enough to pop the tube if only I could secure the pump on the valve. This pump leaks air and makes it hard to know when you've got it set right. Keep shopping."
3,quick delivery,"Product arrived quickly and looks nice on the bike.I have not had to use it yet, and I'm in no hurry to do so."
5,Want a milkshake?,I worked in an old-fashioned drug store during high school. I have wanted my own milkshake maker ever since. This is a fantastic product. The shakes turn out just like they used to at work. I love that the motor is powerful enough to handle thick shakes and freezes. The spindle is very sturdy and allows for moving the cup around to get the perfect blend. I use the same formula for my creations that I learned at work - 3 scoops of ice cream and just enough liquid for desired thickness. I have had no problem with splash over. Extra cups are $9.99 from the manufactuer.I would definately purchase this mixer again.
2,very poor recording quality,I own several cd's by MS and find her work interesting if somewhat uneven. The sound quality on this cd is very poor I am surprised she allowed it to be released. The only redeeming aspect is a neat little book that is somewhat autobiographical and allowed me to win a bet with a friend MS is not her real name.
4,A great look at her early years,"Alt-folkie Michelle Shocked was right there when the current ""Americana"" boom was just getting underway, and I've always thought of her as having a strong, positive influence on its growth. This is an interesting set of informal, live performances by this intelligent, unassuming alt-folkie, made at the start of her career, when she was making the rounds of various ""women's music"" gatherings. Shocked was particularly cool, though, for opting to emulate Woody Guthrie rather than lesbian folk icons such as Tret Fure or Holly Near, who often tended to be a bit dreary and un-fun. These solo acoustic recording aren't completely electrifying, but they are a nice, unpretentious look at her early work. It's especially charming when you hear some truck whiz by on the freeway while she's crooning out a tune... now, that's authenticity!! The new 2-CD edition expands greatly on the original, single-disc set, and has been re-released on Shocked's own Mighty Sound label."
2,"not her best, not her worst","Well, it wasn't her worst albumn. But is not here best. Only buy this if you must own everything she has ever done."
4,low level,"this album is really some of the folkiest, piniest music you can find outside of folkways. i highly recommend it, but i will warn that the recording levels on this album are so low, that even with stereo at full blast, some guitar-strumming is hard to hear. if you want really down-home at its best, though, you're gonna have to deal with the drawback."
2,What a disappointment,"This CD is a major disappointment for a huge fan. One often hears the phrase ""for fans only""; in this case, I would say, ""fans stay away"". ""Takes"" contains the original CD, which Michelle much lamented and which seems to have started the rift between her and Mercury Records, and the so-called ""real McCoy"", apparently taken from the actual tapes but with more material.The problem with the second CD is the sound quality. I have heard many bootlegs that sound pristine compared to this. I literally had to turn my (100-watt) car CD player all the way up to even barely hear most of it. Many of the lyrics and the between-song dialog are practically unintelligible. This is extremely frustrating, especially knowing all the technology that's available now to fix these sorts of problems. This is 2003. Even if she couldn't get a decent copy of the tapes, they could have been cleaned up much better.This is a very weak first release for Mighty Sound. Hope the rest are better."
2,Recording level is much too low,"There is some great song writing on this CD. In my opinion the writing is much better than her latest CDs. More organic and rootsy and very clever phrasing. Unfortunately the recording level is so low it is hard to make out the lyrics. I am talking about playing the CD on a reference level system with an overload of power. I am very disappointed. I purchased this 2-disk set because I thought the second disk would fix some of the problems present in the original release. No, I did not expect a studio-quality album. I just expected an improvement. There are more tracks on the second disk, but the sound quality is still so poor it makes it hard to hear the lyrics or enjoy any emotional content. The listener cannot relax and enjoy the music because they have to work so hard at listening."
4,vintage blondie,It took me back to when i was a teenager. Great songs to sing along with. I recommend this for anyone old or young.
2,could have been perfect,"it's not the edited versions, it's that ""Heart of glass"" misses the classic 8 seconds intro before the explosion of keyboard, guitar anddrums sound, a portion of music that has become a ""classic"" by its own,being sampled by many rappers in their hits.I bought this compilation because i read the titles and saw the bonus dvdbut i get very upset by what mentioned above. fortunately i own a copy of ""The complete picture"" - Chrysalis 1991"", which actually is THE greatest hits as it includes even Debbie Harry solo hits, and also ""Parallel lines""which is an era defining album to have absolutely.maurizio fiorentiniThe Complete Picture: Very Best of Blondie"
4,"Good Collection, Though It Helped Me Learn I'm Not A Real Blondie Fan.","I enjoy female vocalists and bands with female vocalists. I also liked other bands of the Blondie era like Berlin, Missing Persons, the Go Gos and the Bangles. I thought I liked Blondie, but the more I learned, the more I realized I didn't like them as much as the other bands.Blondie fit the new wave movement. On one side, it was progressive, paving the road for the typical '80's sound. On the other side, it was nostalgic, borrowing from the '50's. Blondie captured both sides.""Call Me"" is one of my favorite songs, and I always enjoyed ""Heart Of Glass"". Other songs left me cold. Part of the problem was the 50ish sound of those songs, and part is the lyrics. (For example, while I love the sound of the verses and chorus of ""Rapture"", I despise the silly rap segment.)There is a DVD, and that is good nostalgia, but they didn't do much for me. It was not as developed as most MTV videos."
3,In The Flesh BUTCHERED,"I was never a huge Blondie fan, still not, but holy sh*t is Atomic and Hanging on the telephone addictive. So when I heard about this cd coming with a dvd, I decided to buy it instead of any of their other albums. It has the songs everyone knows: Heart of Glass, The Tide is High, call me etc, so it seemed like a decent album to start with. Ughh then I got to ""In The Flesh"", a great song that for some reason they thought it would be a good idea to put a remix and not the original. Totally Unlistenable. Anyway watching their chessey videos is fun and since I didn't pay full price for this thing I'll live."
3,"Too Short, but sounds good.","Most of the songs are the shortened/edited single versions. Not the album versions. Too bad. However, within the CD/DVD packaging, there is advertising for all the albums (even Hunter) stating there are bonus tracs. I guess this CD is a come-on to buy all the original albums. Almost no liner notes--no who's who or timeline history or anything. Again, too bad. Sounds good."
5,Each volume is better than the last! A must have for Phans!,"The Pharmer's Almanac is an invaluable reference guide for anyone with any kind of Phish bootleg collection. The entires are accurate, well-written and FUN! We are constantly referring to the Almanac for information about shows that we have seen, and the reviews bring back awesome memories!"
5,The Phish Bible,"In what is probably everything you need to know about Phish, the Pharmer's Almanac is written by the band's fans, with their stories of touring, reviews and setlists of every show ever up through summer 97, suggestions as to which tapes to pick up, a full history of the band, and a survey of everything that interests people about the greatest band of all time. It is a must have for even the most casual Phish Head, and the bible for serious Phish Heads."
1,This isn't the one you want,"Not as interesting as Go Phish, not as good photos as the Phish Book, not as intelligent as the Phish Manual, not as complete as the Phish Companion, and not as fun as Mike's Corner. It's the big name brand Phish book, so get it if you're a McDonald's kind of guy. But if you care what you're getting, pick one of the others."
5,Great database for Phans,"Wow. I never knew the many things that this book talks about such as cover songs, reviews of concerts, and the number of times each song was played. A must for any Phish fan."
3,Love this Shoe but it Broke after Little Use!,"I love these shoes. I bought them in black at a store near me two years ago. I wore them very infrequently but they were stored carefully. They are so comfortable and good looking! Love them.Today I take them out for a spin and the left shoe broke open where the leather meets the sole. I can't believe it. If anything I have lost weight and I'm not overweight. I wasn't running or anything, just walking leisurely in a mall. I am disappoint."
5,My son outgrew them so now they are mine!,"These are great shoes. When my son outgrew them, I grabbed them, and that was a few years ago. I am a (large) woman with wide feet, and women's shoes just aren't made as well as mens. These fit great, feel great, and wear extremely well. I'm pretty rough on my shoes, and with no care (I'm lazy), they still look great. I like the way they look. The only wear I see is on the soles (but they are very long-lasting), so I will probably be wearing them another 5 - 10 years! They aren't cheap, but you get what you pay for. In the long run, they are a real bargain, and when it comes to your feet, comfort, durability and common sense wins.Another reviewer mentioned a squeak - mine don't squeak at all. In fact, that's one reason I wear them at work, my sneakers squeak terribly.I also don't notice any leakage when I trek around in the rain and snow.I love them!"
5,A Very Good Reference,"I've read the less pleased reviews and I understand their displeasure, but I remain highly approving of this book. Before I began knitting last summer, I had looked at many books to gain the best understanding of knitting I could, as my previous attempts had failed. After reading Knit Fix I finally understood what was going on.Maybe more experienced knitters than I don't need this with the other reference books out there, but I remain convinced that this book is very useful, with a great deal of information I needed and still need nearly a year later. I find the tips scattered throughout the book helpful, and it covers mistakes I've made. I hadn't thought of several of the techniques in this and when I did, I wasn't sure how to do it. If I'd had this with me a few weeks ago I'd never had to frog an entire section of one of my knits.I don't own Knit Fix now, I admit, but I fully intend to in the future."
2,Better for the money,"I've found better knitting references for the money. This isn't bad, just not the best bargain you are going to find. For a quick, and handy reference, and a relatively low price, try 'The Knitting Answer Book' -- a good reference, just takes a while to find what you are looking for. The best would be the Vogue Knitting Book, but there you get what you pay for..."
3,knitters book,I like the book...but somehow I received 3 books instead of the two I ordered. by the time I pay shipping....I might as well keep it.
3,Not as much of a savior as I thought it would be...,"I was thrilled to get this book, hoping it would reveal the secrets of fixing my own work WITHOUT having to rip out row after row. And while the pictorial guides and explanations of what can go wrong are invaluable, in fact the advice the author offers, more often than not, is to ""rip back to the mistake."" Bah!All the same, while this guide has not saved me from frogging, it is a great addition to my knitting library. Now when something goes wrong, I can at least diagnose what it was, with the hopes I can avoid it the next time around.A great volume to include in any knitting book collection."
3,A good basic reference.,"This is a good basic help for most problems one tends to run into while knitting. However, it is not as detailed as other similar books. The size is a bit bulky to carry with one in his/her knitting bag. The spinal type is handy, and does enable the book to lay flat. Overall a good basic book, just not comprehensive enough for ""everything""."
2,LOVED the first 3,"I fell asleep twice - only out of sheer willpower was I able to finish this last in the series.Too much mumbo jumbo - hypotheticals and the theory of life and existence.I'm sorry, I just didn't like the conclusion to the whole series - but I still thought the first three were great and I'd recommend stopping after that."
3,Exellent idea but not so great book,"In my opinion the book was a bit dissapointing. The idea behind the book, Lightweight Enterprise Architecture, is great, but the author clearly struggles with getting the important ideas trough to the reader and the impression you are left with is neither very clear nor consise. The language used in the book seems to be filled with empty phrases commonly used these days in the IT industry that at least to me as a non-native english speaker makes no sense. The second half of the book is also just a copy of publically available material that could in my opinnion have been left out.However, the book contains an excellent description of a set of enterprise architecture antipatterns, which i found both very entertaining and useful."
1,Author not really got hold of EA,"This book seems very dated and the author doesn't really get a good hold of EA and how to implement it in an organisation. There is a good section on organisation culture but I think most EAs or would be EAs would be better of reading Enterprise Architecture As Strategy: Creating a Foundation for Business Execution by Jeanne W. Ross, Peter Weill and David C. Robertson (1 Aug 2006), or reading TOGAF or PEAF online."
5,Delightful and imaginative picture book!,"This is a wonderful little book that tells its offbeat story of a mouse who finds a way to escape the book where he is trapped. The tale is told entirely through charming pictures - no words, the perfect way for this magical story to unfold. One of my daughter's top favorites when she was small, and a pleasure for parents too. A treasure that should still be in print!"
3,A LITTLE DISAPOINTED,"When I opened my Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind, Perfect Collection, Box Set I noticed that two of the books 3 and 4 are distinctly shorter then 1 and 2 by about half a centemeter. This is not a major thing I relize but still it's rather annoying and is something of a disapointment. Vis corp needs to cut there books in a more presise manor."
5,AMAZING.....,"This is one of the most amazing works of art I have ever seen. I don't know what else to say. Both the story and art is breathtaking. Miyazaki is such a humanist, much like Steven Spielberg and Zhang Yimou."
3,"This will be good, but complete games will be better","I will buy this and I'm sure it will be good, but a complete game collection like the one done last year for the Red Sox (Playoffs and World Series)would be better. There's no reason why we can't have it, so I'm wishing the White Sox would get on it soon!"
5,Well written sci-fi adventure,"If you are a fan of Battletech like I am you need to read this book. It is well written and the characters are engaging. There are some points where the hero's luck is beyond good, but that's why he's the hero."
4,An excellent action-adventure with very good pace.,"Keith creates a world of violence and chaos, with a likeable young hero stranded on a planet torn by civil war. Characters are well drawn for an action story. There are well drawn male and female characters.I felt this book was more consistently interesting and better paced than Operation Excaliber, the only other of Keith's novels that I have read.For those who've enjoyed Decision at Thunder Rift, there are several other Battletech books which continue the adventures of the likeable young hero"
3,good but doesn't have classics such as creme brulee,"I liked the book a lot. It has many good tips and practical information. I have some knowledge of the subject, for beginers I think a little more explanations would be necessary.There are some classic recipes missing, that I would`ve expected to be in the book"
2,Not for true beginners,I should have taken more note of Robin's review. This book is NOT for someone who knows little or nothing about Exchange Server despite what the introduction of the book states. It jumps right in to migration issues and follows up with other subjects including installing and other administrative issues. There was no overview of what Exchange Server does as would logically be the first thing a beginners book would include. Purchasing and reading this book has been a waste of time and money for me. Maybe after I find a book that can get me up to speed I'll go back to this book and benefit from it.
2,Not very simple!,Great Book for domains with child domains but for simple starters it is not what I thought it would be. Limited detail in the migration and even more limited in basic tasks. The book is good just not for starters. I recommend something else.
3,Not a great beginners book,It was a little hard to understand this book as a beginner.The examples are not clear and I had a hard time figuring out on my own. The first section covers the migration from 5.5 to 2000 and as a beginner I thought that should be covered at the end.This book should'nt be called a beginners guide but should be called migration for beginners.Overall This book is better for those who know Exchange 5.5and it would be more of a burden for an exchange beginner.
4,not to bad,"This book is extremely easy to read, and is good for day to day administration, however for a serious dose of what goes on behind the scenes with exchange you will want something a little deeper. However for the ease of reading and pretty complete coverage of the topic I give it a 4. It will teach you about %90 of what is needed to adminster exchange."
5,a must buy for basic and intermediate admin,"Together with Bill English, Nick Cavalancia has provided a comprehensive and effective tool to assist in use, understanding, and configuration of exchange. Mr. Cavalancia presents in a easy to understand and organized manner. It is very clear that his extensive command of the microsoft product suite enables and enhances the presentation and information provided in this book.This publication is a must own reference tool for any administrator and/or person wishing to better understand the quagmire that is ""Exchange""."
5,Relaxing,"I use this video at night as part of my evening routine. It is so far my favorite yoga video. I ordered two other videos ( Shiva Rae vinyasa flow and kundalani yoga) just to add variation to my routine. I love the fact that my breathing flows with the move. It is so easy to follow. Love using it during m stressful days. Not really meant to build muscle or tone (I use pilates videos for that in the morning). I guess if you want to unwind, then this is a good one to use."
1,Pass on the Plastic,"I might have been able to enjoy this workout were it not for the stiff, robotic instructor, and inauthentic--sometimes eerily downbeat--new age/zen music. It would have been nice if the instructor kept better eye contact, spoke as though she was there with you in a natural setting--rather than read mechanically from a prompter. She also has this strange head-nodding tick that just became another distracting turn-off. The DVD reminds me once again that with any lesson, the instructor can make it or break it."
1,Very upset,"I ordered this product at the beginning of September and I never received it- today is Oct 13. I tried emailing the seller, and they never responded. I hope your business goes down the tube because your business practices are TERRIBLE."
3,INTRIGUED ME!!!,"This is a first read by Gayle Wilson, but I do like Anne Stuarts books too. What a happy surprise to find that I liked both stories. I like Romance and Suspense together and this filled the bill. Another plane ride conquered thru reading this delightful little book!!!!!Liked all the heroes and heroines. Night was an interesting plot and so was Day, but Day was a little darker. Very amusing and interesting little stories."
1,THIS guy created the Simpsons?,"I can't believe that THIS guy created the Simpsons. This book isn't fun at all. I keep looking for it to be funny, and finding nothing. It's not worth the price of shipping. I grew up in the 80s and 90s, I understand that situational comedy was big then... but this is just awful."
2,WW II Newsreels,"I ordered this thinking that it was another product. If you like clips of the old WW II news reels, I think you'll like this product."
2,Not leather as advertised.,"Even though this is a very nice looking and roomy tote, it is not in fact leather as specified. If you don't have a problem with that, you'll love it. I just like getting what is described."
2,Not tight enough,"When you see the Silicone skin case or even the description of it, you tend to think hard molded plastic. On the contrary, it is actually made of a loose, rubber-like substance. I did not like the way that it fit the device, it slides on and off to easily, also the material that it is made of sticks to the lining of your pocket, so it sometimes makes it difficult to get in and out of your pocket. I wish the product had a smoother tighter construction. In its defense it does match up exactly to all the components of the device it allows you to access the camera the speaker, USB port, all of that."
2,Fits like a glove but .......,Fits like a glove but is that what you really want from this product ? When you're ready to use your (very expensive) smartphone it's very problematic to slide the screen out - not to mention the cheap feel of the plastic used (supposed to be silicone ?! Excuse me - it looks like really cheap plastic.
3,"cute, but not great quality","when i first got theese earrings i was very excited. they are very cute and a perfect size for my 2 year old daughter, too bad when i took them out and got a closer look they are hollow on the back and quite filmsey. the post was bent just from removing them. i am keeping them since they are so cute on her, but had i known i would not have bought them. too pricey for being so cheap...."
4,A Solid Album,"I do go into this review, not knowing their back catalog. With that said, I find this to be a very rocking disc. All of the songs are hard hitting, and deliver a quality listening experience. The only thing that might turn away a potential purchaser is the vocalist, but I personally love his style and delivery. There are enough sample clips out there for this disc, to know what you are buying. This falls into my top 15 discs purchased this year."
2,Not what I expected. It was not as decribed.,In the description it says the handle is metal/aluminum when it got here it was plastic. Had to return it. When you use it in the cold they break. I thought I was getting the old product before they changed it to the plastic handle. It is made in poor quality now with cheap plastic.
4,Helpful Reference,"At first glance an excellent review of these cars. 33 photos of detail useful to modellers. Chapter 2 - ""Construction of the Tub"" has 40 pages of text and photos on the mechanicals."
4,Miracles Do Happen,"Not only is Sr. Briege's story exciting, but her insights on issues are very helpful."
5,I was taught so many good pieces of wisdom from this book.,"This book was published in 1992, when I was in my early 20s. I read it from cover to cover repeatedly. It taught me so many good pieces of wisdom. I had forgotten about if for a long time, when I discovered it a few days ago. I love it all over again. Daphne Rose Kingma did a wonderful job of saying alot in a few words. Thank you so much Mrs. Kingma. I will relearn your wisdom from a perspective of being 11 years older. This book is very worth the cost and effort of getting it. I am sure it will teach you new wisdom to."
1,disappointed,"I have used the hammock about 2 times and it is already ripping at the seams.. I'm pretty disappointed that after 2 uses, the product is tearing.. I think when I bought the product, it said that it would hold up to 200 lbs. I weigh about 96lbs and it can't even hold my weight..."
1,Poor,"It was difficult, if not impossible to set up and would not support the weight of a 150 pound person."
4,"Easy, portable and comfortable","I feel the need to write a review because I was unsure about ordering this product after reading the 50/50 reviews. I finally went for it and couldn't be happier. It is really easy to set up. The hammock is big and comfortable. My only complaint, which I knew would be the case, is that it is heavy. This makes it great for use at home and when camping or traveling in a car with very little walking/carrying necessary. I certainly won't be dragging it the the beach every weekend, but I would recommend it to anyone."
2,portable hammock mmmm!,"I should have paid attention to the reviews. My husband barely weighs 155 pounds and when he is in the hammock he is dragging on the ground. Might still send back, but we are on an RV trip and he did not use it before we left"
1,with the first use it broke,The first time I used this it broke. The plastic snapped. OK I weigh 200lbs but...........
4,Great portable relaxation,"Forget about lounge chairs. This thing rocks! hehe. Sets up and breaks down in under a minute. A little tricky to get in and out of at first but, no sweat after a few tries. I'm 5'5"" and it's perfect size for me. Caution to anyone over 6 feet, you're not going to fit on it too well also if you're over the 250 weight limit. Otherwise seems real rugged and easy to clean with a damp cloth. I wouldn't want to hike too far with this on my back though. It is quite heavy. Amazon's price is the best I found with the free shipping. Highly recommended."
4,Wonderful Hammock!!!,Impressions of the portable Hammock:Pros:Easy to use.Good materials.Easy to pack.Easy to arm.Not to big while in bag.Cons:WieghtSummary:It is very confortable and nice. A little heavy if you have to carry the hammock a long distance.
5,"Cindy D Amery, WI",I love this hammock. If we had room to take more on our canoe trips we would all take one. I like to stake it out even tighter at each end for a more firm feel. It was hard to pack it up from our living room because we love it so much.
4,Kelsyus Portable Hammock,"Arrived as promised but was a bit surprised that it wasn't the same hammock I had ordered previously. The description seemed accurate... I just didn't read carefully enough (obviously). This hammock was a smaller version without a cup holder and didn't even come with a head pillow but still functioned as designed. I am keeping this hammock, but am ordering another of the larger style with the pillow and cup holder. I would definitely recommend spending the extra bit for the larger size as the smaller version seems too easy to tip out of."
3,Almost right,The biggest complaint that I have is that the hammock part is too long or the support poles are too short. Every adult that I know that tried out the hammock hit bottom getting into the hammock. I had to modify it to make the support stand taller.Other than that it was just what I was looking for.
5,WOW!!,"This is a great album from Reba's early days on Mercury. It may not have spawned any hits but, by gosh, it proved that this woman was a force to be reckoned with in country music. I only wish she would go back to singing music like this! It is sensational! I love the first song ""I Still Long to Hold You Now and Then"" and ""Rain Fallin"". The Duet with Jacky Ward ""That Makes Two of Us"" is great also. THe rest of the album is also very well done and Reba is in fine fettle!!"
5,EARLY REBA IS LOADS BETTER THAN NOW REBA!!,"Compared to the ""icky"" stuff she records now, this CD is a priceless treasure!! I never get tired of listening to it as it takes me back to a time when Reba was still a humble, country girl. SHe now has an attitude that makes her insufferable!!"
5,A FINE CD!,"This is a great CD from Reba's early career on Mercury. She doesn't give enough credit to Mercury. I think she recorded some of her finest work there. Certainly it is better than the ""hash"" she's cooked up on MCA from the mid nineties on...namely pop hash. This is country from the ""Urban Cowboy"" craze...but it is still great music and one of her underappreciated efforts."
5,A FINE SOPHOMORE ALBUM;,"This was Reba's sophomore album. It is filled with genuine country tunes done in a countrypolitan mode. But this isn't bad. At least it isn't like the crossover things they call country today. Reba sounds like she's still trying to find her voice...but she was only just beginning. But I think she sounds tremendous. It may be quaint but at least its listenable. The songs are first rate too...""Rain Fallin"" and ""Last Night Evry Night"" alone make the CD worth owning. But ""I've Never Stopped Dreaming of You"" and ""Runaway Heart"" are excellent too. I absolutely loved the duet she did with Jacky Ward ""That Makes Two of Us"". When Reba does her part on this.....she's positively irresistable!! I love the tribute song she wrote to her ""Daddy"" on this as well. ""Make Me Feel Like a Woman Wants to Feel"" is a great country song with the kind of pedal steel I like!! Overall its a great CD and one I definitely will keep."
5,Perfect.,"Before using this book, I had a limited knowledge of German vocabulary and almost no knowledge of German grammar. This book explains basic grammar very clearly, and all of the vocab it uses is included in the back of the book. Honestly, I could not find a better book."
3,"It's a bit flimsy, but okay","For the most part the product is okay. The silicon is a bit flimsy and easy to rip. Mine ripped as I was trying to remove it from the cardboard ZenV it came packaged around. It was just a minor tear that hasn't really affected my ability to use it. AlsotThe material that the armband is made of is very uncomfortable. But since this is the only armband I've been able to find for the ZenV, and for $15, it's better than nothing."
3,adequate,"The product does the job, sort of. I'm not muscular and the elastic arm band is at maximum length and almost too tight. Doubt I could even use it there over a jacket."
1,TINY and flimsy,"I purchased this item for my boyfriend. He was looking for a simple armband for his workouts. When I got this item (shipped promptly) I opened it and thought there had to be a mistake. It comes folded into a two inch plastic bag. It was small enough that it only just fit around my upper arm. I'm 5'2 and about 120 pounds... I'm not a big person. The silicone is flimsy. You thread the armband through a slit in the back, and your pricey mp3 player is being held in place by barely 2 cms of the thinnest, weakest looking silicone!I don't know that this armband (if I could have found a way to get it around my boyfriend's arm) would have lasted through a single weightlifting workout LET ALONE A JOG! PLEASE spend the extra money and buy a more substantial armband.HOWEVER!!! I received excellent customer service from PC Microstore! They answered promptly and politely. I once got a response from them within 10 minutes of sending my email!"
1,Don't waste your money!!!!,"I should have read more of the other customer reviews before buying this thing. The quality is terrible, and the armband won't fit on anyone other than a nine-year-old's arm."
2,Armband too small for a man...,I received two of the bands and while they are ok (though a little on the cheap side) and it fits my wife there is no possible way a man can use this around the upper arm. It really should be named wristband...
2,"Armband Too Small, Overall Low Quality","I am no muscle man by any means, but this armband is way too tight for me. The elastic stretches a little, but it seriously feels like a blood pressure cuff every time I get it above my elbow. The quality of the case is pretty low, too. I expected it would be thicker, it is maybe slightly thicker than a latex condom. Doesn't seem like it would provide much protection if dropped, but it does do a good job of keeping the player from sliding across the table when I have it plugged in. I would say definitely avoid, there has got to be a better value out there."
4,Sticky Fingers?,"Amazing book! I ordered it Chirstmas night with my Amazon giftcards and when my package was delivered to my house, this was the first book I read. It was very good, but I'm not to sure why the title is Sticky Fingers."
1,waste of time,"First off, the summary on the back of the book is totally misleading. ""But one drink is all it takes for her perfect facade to shatter."" The incident that is supposed to be the whole lesson of the story occurs in the last 43 pages! In the copy I have, there are 274 pages total and she takes the drink on page 231! Ultimately, the summary on the back exaggerates everything and the book is really slow. I was looking for a good read but I got something that was completely boring and, in many ways, predictable. Even the title doesn't match. It doesn't even apply to the main character."
4,Good read,"Another good read for teens and adults alike.The story of a girl trying to figure out her place in life - while trying to hold on to her ideals and her ideas of how she should be.I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I knew what the 'punch' line would be and kept expecting it earlier in the book. I think more could have been made of the incident. Unfortunately, it arrives towards the late part of the book and I felt as though the impact of the actions taken were kind of hurried over. I would have liked to have seen the author and the character focus more on the incident.Still, a good read. It was refreshing to read about a teen who was not ready to compromise on her ideals.Good buy."
3,not what i thought it would be,It was a good read. I got it yesterday afternoon and I just finised it. It was definitly interesting.I thought I would be able to relate to the main character because her boyfriend was kinda pressuring her to have sex and that is something im dealing w/ and thats the main reason i got the book. and by the end of this book i decided that i dont wanna have sex. cause the ending of this book kinda blows and is messed up. but it was a good read. i wouldnt read it again tho.
3,Not What I Expected.,This book is not anything like what it says in the description. Most of the book was pretty slow at the end it picked up and was entertaining. But I wouldn't recomend reading this based on the description.
2,There are better YA books...,"Nothing happened in this book until the very end, and that wasn't even exciting. Jenna is boring. Her boyfriend is boring. Her best friend is the only one with any spunk. The author could have really gone somewhere more emotional with the date rape drug storyline. Instead nothing happens, Jenna gets sick. There are probably better YA books out there that deal with date rape better than this. Do not recommend."
1,not impressed,"I think this book would be better for a younger teen, or a teen who is used to reading teen books. I'm only 17 but I hardly ever read books found in the teen sections. So I think thats why I didn't like this book. It had lots of teen slang and cheesey high school girl talk and romances. (I know I'm in high school, but I'm just not used to reading things like this). It had a good concept and lesson in the end. I really did like the ending, but the rest of the book was just personally hard for me to get through. I would recommend this to any teen who typically reads teen books like this... but for anyone else who reads more mature novels, don't waste your time. Overall, it wasn't bad, but NOT for me."
5,Perfect gift for a college graduate,This is the perfect gift for a college graduate or anyone thinking of embarking on a new path.
4,Very informative,"This is a very informative and all around must have for anyone who keep poultry. I am very impressed with the book and plan to purchase more from the Storey's series... Anyone who needs information on health, feeding, housing, caring for and raising different types of poultry needs to to have this book in their library."
3,Seriously depleted of non-coventional information,I have found this book to be full of inefficient and unhealthy practices for raising poultry. The author leaves out important deep litter concepts and the importance of fresh grass. Good general information though.
1,Certainly not Petula Clark & Peter O'Toole,"First off, I do not own this CD. I have listened to parts of it.The CD is obviously a recording of a stage version of Chips, with some added songs. But also with some rather grievous omissions. Where is ""London Is London"" which was so beautifully performed by Clark - and for that matter Clark's soulful lament to ""Apollo"". This recording just won't do. I'm sorry I can't share the other reviewer's enthusiasm. I would much rather listen to the VHS version to get my fix. I do own the original MGM issue of the soundtrack on vinyl, thank God. It's about time the original with O'Toole & Clark were issued on CD. For that matter I would love to see this film on DVD also. So how about Apollo ""make my dream come true"""
4,Finally this CD was released!,"Ever since I saw the movie 'Goodbye Mr.Chips' starring Peter O'Toole I've been searching and hoping that someday the songs and lyrics of this great musical would be released. I have never seen the stage version of this musical however so I knew there would be some differences. It's been a while since I've seen the movie so I could be wrong on this, but I believe all of the songs featured on the movie are in the soundtrack...not sung by Peter O'Toole but equally as good I think. There were also some songs that were new to me, that weren't featured in the movie. Also, the plot of the stage version must be somewhat different from the movie, so there are surprises there as well. Overall my long awaited release of this soundtrack was met with a wonderful CD to add to my collection."
1,Movie Version on CD IS NOW AVAILABLE,"I've not heard this stage recording, but thought that those interested in this recording should know that Film Score Monthly just released a 3 CD edition of the 1969 movie score. It includes the original soundtrack album and the music as heard in the movie. Plus quite a few alternate takes and interviews with Peter O'Toole and Petula Clark. A 48-page booklet details everything you may want to know about this neglected score.Search out this recording. It is so well worth it."
2,goodby mr. chips...when in CD????,I agree with the fan from baltimore...the soundtrack is better. (there is a japanese version of the soundtrack in Cd but very hard to find)
4,great materia medica,"I like this book a lot. it is a great materia medica for flower essences! I could have given it five stars for the materia medica, but I would have loved to have a part in the book where the remedies also were listed per se, but he do give guidelines for where you can find this. But i do recommend this book for everyone seriously working with or interested in floweressences, really great work!"
4,Needs an editor,"While the basic information is presented in a concise and well-organized manner, it was very distracting to fight through the grammatical mistakes, punctuation errors and/or typos on nearly every page! The publisher should be ashamed to put out a book that has obviously not been edited."
1,The UNREAL Deal!,This was a poorly written book covering most of the basic info about the game which would only interest someone without any previous background. I would ask the other reviewers if they are related to the author! You will find numerous spelling errors throughout the book. A must avoid book!
5,Excellent,"Order got mixed up to begin!I requested the Boot with the side Zipper and did not receive them.Other then that I like to boots, very light,sturdy boots and comfortable.I recommend the Side Zipper for anyone over 50 or slightly over weight."
4,Light-hearted and Inspirational,"I really enjoyed reading this little gem. In a way, it reminds me of Thich Nhat Hanh in that it asks the reader to suspend their busy mental flow and just bask in the message. As a reader who often reads more complex material, this is a pleasant change of pace.My only complaint is the targeting of the audience, which sometimes feels a bit condescending. The author conveys a universal message that need not be qualified. Regardless of ones own beliefs, there is quite a lot to be learned here about Sufism, Islam, Arabic and life itself. But most of all, it is rejuvenating."
5,Excellent introduction to sufism,"The author assumes no knowledge on the part of the reader, and the book serves as an excellent introduction to the wide field of sufism. As the book itself says, it is aimed primarily at the western reader and should open up the awareness of this target audience to the interplay of forces beyond the immediate domain of existence.At a time when humanity is facing great threats from within itself, the book serves as a useful reminder that we can return to the spiritual essence within ourselves by denying our own selfish motives and reaching outwards to the service of humanity, for it is only by helping others and seeking the guidance of a 'sufi master' that we can realize our true purpose in life."
3,not as expected,"It is perhaps a mistake to expect any book to convey a truth about mysticism or religious fervor. Certainly the writer and his students who produced the volume are motivated by sincere devotion, and that comes through. In an effort to understand what I don't understand, I read this book: I found that my favorite part was the last sentence, which concludes that the Sufi ""lives in a universe held together by the pure love of Allah, and is amazed at the spectacle."" I enjoyed the perspective on scientific knowledge as revealing the endless splendor of god (rather than as presenting, somehow, some kind of a threat to what is divine,) but I was surprised how much of the book deals with issues of terminology/taxonomy, propriety and hierarchy. The information about jinns and angels came as a surprise as well."
5,Wonderful !,I had double fusion back surgery five years ago and have had a lot of discomfort since. This has helped relieve a lot of pain and discomfort. Great product ! Forget wrapping the towel around your ankle. This works so much better !
4,Love this movie.....,This is such a great movie & will always cheer you up when you are feeling down...... Straight up classic.....
1,big let down.,"I read a lot of reviews saying this product gives you amazing products. Well not for me. People got ultra rares and secret rares. I got 2 rares and 3 sucky super rares. And my commons were horrible. I got jipped., they didn't give me any sleeves like I'm supposed to get. But I still have the receipt so I can hopefully get a new one. I still don't think this is great. The only two good cards i got were masked beast promo and some fusion guy. I got legend of blue eyes pack in it and thats the worst one. Overall the one I got sucked.better luck with the new one i could get cause i didn't get sleeves."
1,VERY DISAPOINTED,"the content of ALL the ""5 packs"" I received are nothing but left-overs - nobody wants those cards, including myself. It may be a coincidence, but I didn't get ONE single good card within the 45 of the 5 packs: there were 5 rare cards everyone has a full-hand of and 40 common cards nobody wants to hear about!"
1,BAD BAD BAD!,"First of all, I got a buster blader :(. Second of all, the deck box was broken. The cards were bent in the deck box. The boosters were LOB, LON, PSV, MRD, MRL. I got all of the cards bent and torn. My rare in LOB was a Flame Ghost. My MRL rare was a Masked Sorcerer. MRL had a Flying Kamikiri #1, PSV had an appropriate and LON had Gilasaurus. DOnt buy this!"
1,Yu-Gi-Oh The Scared Cards,In this game rumors on the internet says the we can use the3 Egypian God Monsters in this GameBoyAdvance game.
5,great vocals and instrumental back-ups.,"i first heard this cd on a rival seller's jazz site where they were playing ""dream a little dream of me."" i ordered it based on that and have not regretted it for one instant and have been listening to it ever since. leonie smith sent it herself, complete with a thank you note!every song is a standard/classic and leonie smith does a great job on all of them. she has a nice, at times, plaintive voice and is especially good on ballads. her instrumental back-ups are great, too, and there are some good solos. ""nature boy"" is especially good. i was impressed with the recording quality, too, which came through on the instrumentals.if you want to hear a new (to the usa) female jazz voice from down under whom i would put up there with diana krall, madeline eastman, jame monheit and jenna mamina, buy this cd. you won't regret it. it is leonie smith's introductory cd and hopefully it won't be her last."
2,This book is short on coding performance tips.,"What I was hoping for was a book that would help me write better performing Java programs. What I got was a book with big type and lots of white space that offers little real information on performance improvement. Much of the book is about deployment options or coding tips and tricks unrelated to performance. For example, there are 24 pages on common naming practices. I'm also disappointed that the example code is so sparse. The book's not a total loss. The section on resource pooling is pretty good and there are a few other Java tips to be gleaned from the second half of the book."
3,Idiom? Axiom? Idiocy?,"Something that inanely irritates me about Craig Larman's books is why he uses ""idiom"" when he means ""axiom"". Craig read a dictionary! ""idiom"" has specifically linguistic meaning, whereas ""axiom"" means means an approach or principle."
2,Hardly worth the effort,"I have 2 years Java experience. I learned very little of value about performance optimization of my code, very little about performant design idioms, and nothing about performance issues in large Java systems. I agree with the earlier comment about ""big type and lots of white space"". If you want coding style help, get Kent Beck's book on Smalltalk patterns and apply it to your Java. My overall mileage was pretty low."
5,Very good,"although the book cover Java 1.2, remains current in others. Tuning and performance tasks are extremelly important for management software aging. This book has the concern needs for support it with enough praticals from basic to advanced topics about performance and tunning of java language core, very good!."
3,Moderately useful,"This book is moderately useful if you are relatively new to Java -- with two months of active work in a Java environment most everything in it should seem like common sense. For a beginner just after learning the language syntax, I would recommend it. For someone with, say, a years experience -- given the price -- this book would be a waste of money. Since that's pretty much a match with the authors' claims, I don't fault the book for that. My only real complaint is that the performance section is just plain weak.One word of warning: this book should not under any circumstances be compared to the Scott Meyers C++ books. Those books are really indispensible no matter what your level of experience and deal in depth with language issues that are not obvious and often new features of the language standard."
3,somewhat useful; needs more information on performance,"I found some of the idioms to be fairly useful, yet disagreed with a number of assertions, which is OK. The real problem is that there really wasn't a lot of new information regarding performance. And as far as the non-performance idioms, the Kent Beck Smalltalk Patterns book is more useful, as another reviewer suggested. In fact, I found a more thorough treatment of Java idioms in a book called Essential Java Style, which used the Beck book as its basis.The look and feel of the book is indeed horrid, by the way."
2,Some outdated 1999 tips,"They really should release a 2nd edition with new techniques, and remove the old, disproven stuff (double-checked locking works???). We're on the brink of Java 1.5, this book is pure 1.1.Spend your money on Effective Java by Joshua Bloch. Same style of book, much higher timeliness."
4,Great little A/V DA,Very easy to use a/v amp for both professional and home use. I use it professionally when doing multiple recordings on-location. The quality is exceptional. The only gripe I would have is the power connection as it is located on top with all the other a/v connections just below the the a/v inputs. It would have been preferable to have it on the side away from all the cables.
4,environmental friendly clock,"I like that you just add water to this digital small clock. I just don't like that daily I watch it and the water is not low yet and the time stops so I have to set it again. not sure why it does this. other than that its cool it shows the date, seconds and time all by pressing a button just like you would on a wrist watch."
1,Poor remakes,Most of these songs sound like poor remakes without the original orchestration. The singer's voices also sound different than the original cuts.
1,Waste of your time and money,"Even though I did read the comments about this book covering too many models, I decided to buy it anyway thinking that this would not a big deal. How wrong was my assumption! Now that I've had it for 10 months and having done several repairs on my 1983 Honda CB750SC, I have found this book utterly useless. Every time I refer to it, it tries to include too many models and thus, it does not cover any of them sufficiently and at times it doesn't even mention the model I own. Please, please, do yourself a favor and DO NOT purchase this book. It will be a waste of money and a big waste of my time every time you look up anything in it. Please also spread the word to others who may be naive enough to want to get this book."
3,Very Useful,"We tore down a 1986 CB750F using this. While it could have been a bit better on descriptions (like Muir's Complete Idiot VW book), it still guided us through the process well enough... but it took two of us to be sure what was being said in some parts. That was the hard part.Well, putting the bloody thing back together..."
4,Gripping story,"This page-turner would make a great movie. It cutsbetween multiple story lines, each of which isgripping and, thankfully, not predictable. It isbased on an actual and highly unusual WWII sea battlein the Pacific between an American merchant marineship and a German fighting vessel. It has all theelements of a good war story and seems to speed uptowards what you think is the end only to take you toanother more exciting and unexpected ending."
4,Toups is Terrific,"I started listing to Wayne Toups 20 years ago. I just love his sound. His dance numbers get you up on your feet and the slow ones have you swaying and sighing. This has got so many good tunes that I can't pick a fav. If you have a chance, see one of Toups shows. I've been to two and just dance and partied all night."
2,Tedious and slow to get going,"This book contains very little continuum mechanics in it. It starts out with a tedious development of suffix notation, as well as two chapters developing the properties of cartesian tensors of second order. Unfortunately, this includes proving such basic things as the sum of two tensors being a tensor. The author seems to also enjoy avoiding conventional notation wherever possible, and places everything (products of matrices, products of matrices and vectors, cross products) in suffix notation, which blurs clarity quite often for those new to the convention. Furthermore, the fundamental laws of continuum mechanics are delayed until page 325 (the third from last chapter), leaving only two chapters (a measly two-thirds of the book) for elasticity and fluid mechanics. Finally, the style is a fairly strict theorem-proof, which makes it quite a dry read."
3,Continuum Mechanics made Simple,"In this book, suffix notation is presented in a short but comprehensive manner. All the disciplines of mechanics using notations of tensors and vectors, are readily understandable and coherent."
1,This stuff is awful!,"I bought the combo pack for this which included the cleansing lotion, toner and moisturizer--- it was a waste of money. The cleanser was worst of all, it was drying, did not cleanse well, and I broke out soon after using it and the other productsAlmay Daily Moisturizer for Normal/Combo Skin with Grape Seed, SPF 15, 4 fl oz (118 ml) (Pack of 2). The moisturizer is chalky smelling and not very hydrating. I could not recommend this to anyone."
1,Almay Cleansing Lotion,"I had ordered four of the cleansing lotion in July 2011. When they arrived, the containers were broken with lotion filling the box they came in. My review was not favorable for this product due to inferior materials. Shortly after my review was submitted, I received an email from the company ""Sorry about that. We will ship you out 2 new ones please don't send it back. How should we know about that if you didn't email us about the matter. Can you please give us the chance to fix the problem. And can you have that feedback removed. Thanks gbny"" Foolishly I did this, and to this date have not received replacement products. I will never order this product again and caution anyone who does. This was the worst customer service I have ever received."
2,Bad reception,"I purchased this item because I do not like to wear an armband or have a radio clipped to my clothing while working out. I was disappointed with the reception - there was a lot of static, especially during movement, when the reception would go in and out."
5,Must reading for intelligence professionals,"This work is part of the literary canon used to train intelligence professionals in the United States. Kent, an ex-Yale professor, writes well on the art of estimating and the essays collected here hold up very well given the passing of years.For the general non-fiction reading public, Kent's illustrative anecdotes about De Gaulle, Bedell Smith, Dean Acheson, etc., offer color and interest, as does his ""lessons learned"" essay on analysis failure in predicting Soviet missile deliveries to Cuba.Anyone trying to understand changing National Estimates on Iranian nukes or weapons of mass destruction in Iraq needs this volume."
1,DON'T THINK YOU ARE GETTING TWO...,I OPENED THE BOX THINKING I WAS GETTING TWO LIKE THE PICTURE SHOWS. WRONG!!! APPARENTLY YOU GET ONE. NOT SURE WHAT TO THINK BUT IT GETS ONE STAR. EITHER SOMEONE CANNOT COUNT OR I JUST GOT SCREWED (OR BOTH). IT CLEARLY SAYS FLOOR AND WALL SCRAPERS.
4,Female body,"This book explores the representation of the female body across fifty-five beautiful and surprising photographies of naked young women in three parts. The first part, across decorated rooms. The second part, across thrown images. And the third, in emptyness. The images show the full body in a clear, well illuminated and unexpectedly composed way."
1,poor quality does not ship well,"This product is brittle and arrived with the corners broken, creased in the middle and with the backing separated from the pad on the corners. I returned it immediately. Definitely would not recommend to others."
3,No Resonse,"I received this product damaged. I sent an e-mail to the seller advising of this, but received absolutely no response from Shoplet. This appears to be not very responsible selling."
3,Product quality is disappointing for the price,"Upon arriving, the desk pad's corner edge was cracked and it didn't seem to sit flush with the desk top. Due to the inconvenience of doing a return and shipping the item back, we decided to keep it and overlook the corner flaw and hoped the pad would flatten to the desk top over time.Now that the desk pad has been used for over a month, it is still not completely flat to the desk top. The corner obviously remains cracked but isn't the end-all since papers are usually covering the desk top.I would not purchase this item again - very disappointing purchase for the price."
3,"Simple, Fine and Helpful","This is a more than a diary; this is the details of the movements of the 7th Missouri State Militia. The author has combed through records to discover where each of the companies were located on different days--even those companies which were not with the diarist. He has also included some information on companies that joined this regiment later in the war. The diary itself is pretty thin, but the author has fleshed it out by adding the troop movement details, lists of officers, and personnel. While some of this stuff is easily gathered online now, it was not at the time of the original publication. It's still a simple and sparse publication, but I am grateful for it. It solved a puzzle for me about another diarist's recollections about a specific day."
4,"Gilbraltar Drum Throne - Cello Stool: adjustable from 17"" to 24""",I bought this item for my son for Christmas. He uses it all the time and finds it comfortable. Great item for your money.
1,Gilbraltar Drum Throne,Difficult to assemble. No instructions enclosed. Seat does not mate well with the shaft of the stand. Product was returned as it was not usable.
4,interesting and useful,"the book contains information not easily to find anywhere, it is a very useful and interesting book to help everyone to feel better and in shape."
4,At Least She's Trying,"Suzanne has done the research, and I have already commented on this book, but because I mentioned other books, Amazon took it out. My friend Elsa commented also, and mentioned a better book-also removed. Hmm...But it's okay for ""authors"" to say they are authors and promote their books here. Anyway, I believe Somers has done the right thing in doing the research, the wrong thing in passing it off as ""holistic"". At least she is TRYING to understand her body instead of giving up control to a practicing person with initials after his name."
1,still haven't gotten my ordere,This order was due to me by Aug. 9th it is now the 11th. Luckily I have not been charged for this book. I can't seem to cancel this order.
2,Selling her name not useful information,"Suzanne Somers is doing nothing more than selling her name to make money. She is not a scientist or doctor to suggest chemicals/hormones to keep young. Natural cures are thrown out of window. We have become a drug culture and hardly think about the long-term consequences/side effects.Hope people use natural cures approved by modern scientific findings to keep healthy and young as done in books such as ""Health, Happiness, and Longevity"" and ""Art of Stress-Free Living"" by Yale educated author Dr. Dhillon available on Amazon."
1,Newsweek just did an expose on this book,"It turns out that the primary ""independent"" researcher (T.S. Wiley) who is billed as an ""anthropologist focusing on evolution biology and environmental endocrinology"" with a degree from Webster University... actually has no degree at all. I'm also a little bothered by the picture on the cover. She does look young, but it seems to have been modified (Photoshop? Makeup?) because if you at a regular picture of her, she looks her age and her skin is pretty sun damaged. There may be some validity to this argument, but the deception is disturbing."
3,Good information...,"Within this book, there is much information....some of which I felt was ""wordy"" but other info was very good. I think this is a good read for females young & old as we prep for any stage of our lives. Yes, a good prep book for women to understand possibilities open to them in the way of meds; as well as recognizing our changed bodies - inside & out."
3,Suzy Sommers' rant,"This book is okay. I've only gotten about half way through and so far it seems to only be a cathardic rant. I get that, as I write in order to clear my head, but I wouldn't publish my words. Maybe it'll get better as I get to the second half."
2,Not For Everyone,"First of all, I could not read the book in its entirity. I gave it away. It only talked about the discussions Suzanne and the doctors or so-called experts had to say. She also made a lot of assumptions. It was just a lot of interviews. There were no suggestions as to what you should take, only suggestions to go to such and such a place and mention certain things you should be taking and hoping that someone understands what you are talking about and give it to you. Many women can't take the hormones or follow the regiment. All in all, I found the book very disappointing. Anybody could have done what she did-research with no definite conclusion. It was all about her and what worked for her. I can say that Suzanne was very lucky. Wasted my money."
3,Not sure it's safe,"I purchased this book for my mother and was really excited about finally receiving it (pre-ordered and had to wait many months). Just a could of weeks after giving it to her a news program really broke down the suzanne somers reseach, etc. I am open to trying new things and giving everyone their own choice - but her research is sometime questionable and her doctors equally so. an interesting read - but quite possibly a danger to your health. Not pushing my mother into trying bioidentical hormone therapy anymore! Suzanne was not as convincing as usual when interrogated rather than entertained by the show hosts."
1,How dare she,"Suzanne Somers has crossed the line - from a sensible advocate of bioidentical hormones to an out-of-control MD-wannabe. Although she has interviewed numerous doctors for this book, she seems to have ""drunk the Kool-Aid"" when it comes to the crazy protocols recommended by her friend T.S. Wiley, who has zero medical credentials. Before any women buy into the Wiley Protocols outlined in this book, they should do some internet research and read about the women who have tried it and now bitterly regret it. Erika Schwartz MD was quoted in this week's New York Times as saying this book is ""dangerous."" She's dead right."
3,Ok book....,I read at least 30-40 books a year...Ageless: The Naked Truth About Bioidentical Hormones...I keep the best ones...and then like this one I donate to the public library!~
4,"Itchy, bitchy, sweaty and confused","This book is a great resource when you are itchy, bitchy, sweaty and confused and want to explore your options!Sheryl Gurrentz, author ofA STRANGE PERIOD.: INSIGHTS INTO THE BIZARRE EXPERIENCES OF PERIMENOPAUSAL WOMEN"
4,WOW!,I think every woman over 40 years old should read this book. It was an eye opener for me.... Great book!
5,Insightful,This book is great introduction to understanding hormonal changes and finding the resources to further finding the appropriate medical help. I have recommended to many of my friends.
4,Very informative!!!!,"So much information I really needed to know. Was a great eye opener for me, learned so much and will apply to my daily living."
3,Ageless book,"I ordered this book because I heard so many positive things about Suzanne Somers' experience with bioidentical hormones and wanted to learn more. Basically, the book was helpful but not as detailed on the side affects, etc of these hormones. I am not disappointed with the book but would have liked to learn more about what to expect."
5,Amazing Book!!,"Ageless was Reccommended to Me from a Friend, whose Wife benefited greatly from it. So I got it for my wife & now she has benefited greatly from this Awesome Book!! I was able to Thank Suzanne Somers in person when I met her in Las Vegas a few months back, I was there to learn about her New Anti-Aging, Mood Enhancing Drink called "" Sip of Sunshine"" ~ it's not sold on TV or in stores and it Absolutely Tastes like some of the Best Strawberry Lemonade you ever had. Information at the followingmySipofSunshine. com"
2,Dream the Nearly Impossible Dream,When heard on television Ms. Somer's vision and ideas sound very positive and encouraging for fighting the battle for a quality life. The devil is in the details as reading about the whole concept brings sharply into question the medical aspects and the availability of the entire process to the average consumer. My end take was that the medical benefits are secondary to the ability of the average consumer to actualize her program. It seems to be more of a lark for the rich and famous.
3,nice,this book was recomended by my personal trainer. i can't say i'm WOW aBOUT IT! but it dose have it's strong points.
3,Women's handbook on the role of hormones,"A very factual book on the role of hormones, but too many personal opinions snd repetitive comments by the author."
5,Awesome and Informative,"I am a big fan of Suzanne for bringing the topic of bioidentical hormones to my attention and have read all of her books on the subject. If you are a women late 30's to 90's, this book has something for you. Suzanne looks amazing at age 60 and better than most 30-40 year olds, so clearly the success is evident.Loved the book and will keep it as a reference guide. I am 46 and need to know as much as possible about bioidentical hormones."
2,Glosses over the risks,"First, I love Suzanne Sommers. I also applaud her ability to recover from cancer on her own terms. But I have serious issues with this book, which promotes the use of bioidentical hormones to ""treat"" the natural aging process that accompanies menopause.You cannot put something into your body without it affecting every organ and system. The long-term effects of systemic hormones have NOT been studied. They may cause cancer, strokes or heart disease, just as synthetic hormones did. To take them willy-nilly just to look young, considering the unknown risks, seems vain and foolish.Not all of us are willing to compromise our health in the name of vanity. Readers should proceed with caution."
5,Things you need to know,"After watching the lopsided hit piece on ABC's 20/20, I read Ageless. My girlfriend is taking bio-identical hormones, and she's done a far better job of researching the subject than 20/20, who made a huge deal out of a typo (Gambia, instead of Georgia) in a sentence about longevity. When you don't have a coherent argument, blow smoke.Read this book, and then decide for yourself. But I have an old Popular Mechanics magazine from the '50's, which raves about the benefits of hormones made from coal tar. Big pharma has shown time and again that they tend to value profits over the health of people, their customers; the evidence shows that bio-identical hormone replacement therapy is NOT the same as standard horse-pee replacement therapy."
1,Not a Documentary.,"This is not a ""documentary"" at all. It's an infomercial, made by a conspiracy theory filmmaker (his past credits include the 9/11 truther movie ZEITGEIST; under his assumed name ""Eric Clinton""), made to promote the evil doings of a notorious quack. Neither director Merola nor doctor Burzynski have shown any compunction about lying in the past, so why trust them now?Also, as a movie, it's so very boring. Snore."
5,The best of Indiana Jones,"Last Crusade is as good as Temple of Doom, and a lot funnier. It's Harrison Ford and Steven Spielberg's redemption for the lousy second movie with the irritating blonde."
4,"fast shipping, jewel case damaged, every time again",fast shipping to germanybut jewel case damagedevery time again!
4,Unusual international story,"This is a story about a Turkish man living in Germany with his dad, who commits a crime; the young woman who connects them to some people in Germany, and then back to Turkey again, with young women from both countries who care for each other. That sounds convoluted but it's actually a pretty decent story and quite unusual in its blending of nationalities and cultures."
4,Going Home,"It is an entertaining, educative movie of a modern world, in which different people interact on personal levels, changing geopolitical climate unpredictably.A bit hyperbolised, Kurdish resistance movement extents influence in modern Germany while a chain of tragic events brings about characters back to Turkey regardless their achievements in civilised Germany."
2,Half complete,"Interesting, but not worth the time to watch it. It was a long way from the description on IMDB. Neither a feel-good, or a tragedy."
4,A Must for all Godzilla Fans.,"I am most impressed with this book. As a rookie Godzilla collector, it was fascinating to see the huge selection of merchandise that has been available. Living in the UK, it has been near impossible (until the internet came along) to obtain Godzilla merchandise and now I know what a task is ahead of me! Even if I cannot own the items, at least this book will provide me with a good photographic record. I was especially interested in the section devoted to film posters - it is interesting and hilarious seeing the variations between different country's versions. The book is lilterally packed with colour photos - in fact the only thing which lets it down is the lack of background text/information on the merchandise. I was glad to see no mention of the American/Tristar Godzilla (1998) apart from a entry in the film poster listing -the book was probably compiled just a little too early for this but I feel that it would have no place in the Japanese Godzilla World."
5,One of the forgotten classics!,"I've always been a fan of classic prog-rock. I listen to bands like Pink Floyd, Rush, Led Zeppelin and the usual stuff. I've always been a little bit biased about trying something new. One of my friends told me about Yello. I've never even heard of the band. He borrowed me the Flag CD, and my first impression was: ""This is w-e-i-r-d"". ""Tied Up"" and ""The Race"" didn't impress me that much, but when I heard ""Third of June"" and ""Of course I'm lying"", that was it.""Third of June"" is one of the greatest songs I've heard. It's very powerful and exciting song, and makes alone this album worth buying.It's difficult to put a label to Yello, or place it into one specific category. To me, albums like ""Flag"", ""You gotta say yes to another excess"" and ""Stella"" mean a lot. I wish they stayed on that ""progressive synth-rock"" style, and didn't go for the usual techno-route."
5,Perfection,"This album is a good follow-up to ""One Second"". Very similar in sound, although this record is more thematic in the concept of a race. Flawless musicianship, perfect mixes, unbelievable clarity and a barrage of well-written, well-contrived material adds up to another great album by a great band."
5,Perfect,"As a former nurse, we used this a lot. Now that I have personal experience-Kept the water off my small (less than an inch) wound on my forehead while swimming daily for an hour. These were also way to big, and I was able to cut in half."
5,"As advertised, keeps water & germs out.",Covered up my surgery site and this thing lasted through 7 showers! Doesn't even feel like it is on the skin but provides excellent protection. I am thankful for the product. It is pricey but totally worth it. I bought a 100-count box after trying this one.
4,Not a bad bunch of pre-Mothership jams,"This is generally considered the first ""true"" Parliament album. It has the horns and wah-wah guitars that were the black music standard at the time. It also features some crazy, distorted bass playing by some William Collins kid. And some decent lyrical concepts that rose above the usual love song treacle. ""Together"" and ""RIde On"" are incredibly fun, and ""Big Footin'"" manages to keep the listener's head bobbing despite the fact the melody changes three times within the song! THe only real weak link within the album would be ""Let Me Be"" which is boring despite the inspiried vocals. All in all, a funky, if unpolished album. A good sign of things to come."
4,chocolate city,"This is a great Parlaiment album, had alot of grooves that were right on time for the early 70's then they went up side your head with some funk with ride on, something to move to. a great cd a must have for your collection"
4,Versatile Speedlight Stand,"This versatile speedlight stand has three positions on it to choose from for placing your speedlight.It also has a 1/4 inch metal tripod socket underneath (same threads as your camera).It can also be placed on a table or shelf by itself.This will work with the SB-600 and the SB-800 speedlights.Unfortunately, it will not work with Nikon's flagships speedlight, the SB-900.The SB-900 comes with its own speedlight stand, the AS-21.The AS-21 only has one position and the tripod socket is plastic.However, the AS-21 is backwards compatible with many of the other speedlights and it is larger to accommodate the SB-900's bulk.I would like to see Nikon update the AS-19 to work with the SB-900 or make the AS-21 with a metal tripod socket.I think the metal tripod socket is a big plus, not to mention the three positions.I deducted one star because of the incompatibility with the SB-900."
4,"Ultralast Nikon Stand, AS-19, Speedlight Stand for","If you buy Nikon's Speedlight flash SB-900, this item is included with the flash. Unfortunately, I could not find it in the details of the SB-900 so I ordered this item. However, this stand does work just fine and at ~$17, I did not return it."
2,Be careful,If you have a bad neck or shoulders some of the support you need for the moves may be a problem. Good moves but if you are not sure seek professional help from a therapist.
3,"Great for older ipods, unsupported for the newer ones.","I purchased two of these a while back and have loved them until recently. I got some new ipods and called up the belkin support number to order new adapters so they would hold my ipods correctly and not mess up the connector. After about 20 minutes on the phone the support guy tells me that the product is no longer supported and they do not offer adapters for anything newer than the 2nd generation nano. I have no idea why Belkin decided to abandon this product, it worked very well for me but they did so I cannot give this product over 3 stars.If you have an older ipod, buy this. If you have or plan on getting an ipod touch, just walk on by."
4,"Great product, but not exactly what's described!","This attractive and functional product makes a great home for your iPod as well as providing connectivity to up to 5 USB devices. However, as of this writing Amazon is describing it as having a top-loading USB port, which is not true. The port on the top is an iPod dock, and it comes with adaptors for almost every docking iPod model, but it isn't compatible with the iPod Shuffle as Amazon describes it. (You could still put the Shuffle on one of the USB ports on the back, though.)"
4,as advertised,"Does everything it is supposed to. I hook up 2 printers, pda, camera and Ipod mini with zero issues. ""plug and play"" to my intel iMac. I like its small footprint. I only wish it had a standard size plug to wall, but that would not keep me from buying this product."
4,Belkin TrueSync -1 complaint,"If you leave your iPod IN the holster and turn your computer on, it may very well crash your startup. Simply reset (i.e. hold down the power button) and restart your computer. However this is annoying. Other than that, it works great for solving my mess of wires."
1,IPOD Video? Then steer clear!!,"Bought this as a Christmas present and it can not be used with the IPOD Video. The adapter plate to fit the Video is not packaged with this ""TuneSync"". I've requested it from Belkin but have not received it and their customer service is rude and can not, or will not help.It does however, work nicely as a paper weight I just wish this useless bit of electronics didn't cost a much as it did."
5,This book is timeless,"I bought this book thinking that it would make a nice reference book with hand drawn illustrations. Boy was I surprised when I started reading it. Once I started, I couldn't put it down. I read the whole book in one night and then immediately started recommending it to friends and family. Everyone I loaned it out to loved it. I love how the anecdotes really give you a feeling on who the author really is.Reading this book will make you feel like you just spent a few days talking with your grandfather about ""the good old days."""
5,Wood Widow,"My husband read this book cover to cover the first day he received it. When he was considering giving up his dental practice I gave him a gift of woodwork lessons taught by a very talented young man in our area. For some reason, dentists seem to love carving, lots of detail and intricacies. He spends hours with his projects in order to get ""the right feel"" to the wood. He collects old tools and reworks them. At any rate, he was so taken with this particular book and wanted me to relate that to your readers. He also appreciated the seller expediting the book, in perfect condition in paperback, which is what my husband requested. Unfortunately, or maybe not, he doesn't use a computer himself."
5,"Great book, both for woodworkers and those interested in early Americana","This is Sloane's best book in my opinion, but then I've been a woodworker for many years and already have ""a reverence for wood"". There is much to learn here, a lot of information compressed into easily understood drawings and text and a joy to study. Highly recommended for both the woodworker and anyone interested in wood and its properties and uses."
5,Cliff Claven writes a book.,"This is one of my all-time favorite books. I read it in a sitting. I'm not even all that interested in wood or building anything else that may have made me a likely fan. The writing was fantastically engaging, and the tidbits and anecdotes just kept coming. I say it's Cliff Claven writes a book because that's how I've been describing it for 10 years now - Sloane's enthusiasm and honest passion are to writing what the charm of a pure young laugh is to happiness. I've given this book away I don't know how many times, and have never heard of somebody not loving it too."
2,Not what I expected,"Read the feature list carefully. This timer will turn the lights ON according to the sunset schedule where you live but it WILL NOT turn them OFF according to the same schedule. You only have the option of turning the lights on according to the sunset schedule and then you must choose between 2,4,6,8,10 or 14 hours for the lights to turn off. I have no idea why they would come up with such a great idea and drop the ball by not allowing the lights to turn off according to the time of sunrise in your area. Oh well, I guess that is why I don't run a company. I'm not smart enough.If you are looking for a timer that will turn the lights on at sunset and turn the lights off at sunrise you may want to look at the following product. It is also $40 cheaper right now due to a promotion running from Amazon.Buy this one: Aube by Honeywell TI044/U Solar Programmable TimerIt works great and it is exactly what I wanted.Hope this helps!"
5,Digital - Zip Code On/Off - Well Made!,"Purchased two; easy to install and works perfect. Well made high quality OUTDOOR box! Waterproof..... Enter ZIP CODE, HOW MANY HOUR TO BE 'ON', AND SETUP IS DONE! That simple!"
5,Sylvanis SA310,AN excellent choice of timers with battery backup in case of power failure. The user will need to read and follow the directions for setting the times. It worked very well and the battery back up is a great option in case of power failure.
3,Adventure of a Lifetime!,"Isobel Scott is a Selkirk settler and she is struggling with her family to finally be able to live at The Forks. With his wife dead, Isobel's widowed father marries an Native, White Loon. This new family tries to survive the feezing winters and boiling summers on a harsh journey to live at The Forks. Find out if the Scotts actually make it to the Red River Settlement by reading this great novel!"
1,"The toe parts are too narrow, and not very comfortable to walk on","I like the stylish looks of this pair of clog, however, the front part of the clog are too narrow to me, and the shoes do not feel very comfortable to walk on. Somehow feeling hard and yet wabbling! I had to decide to return them right after trying them on upon receiving them...!"
4,Excellent album; it grows on you,Miracle Baby is just another example of great new music coming out of Seattle that isn't grunge oriented. Fiia McGann has come into her own as a singer and will go far.
2,I wondered why...,"I wondered why this cannot be shipped to APO address! I'm going to a beach in two weeks, hoping to learn to surf. Now I got to find something else to do while staying there. :*("
5,Definitive guide to the American Icon the Diner.,"A case study of the factory-built roadside diner complete with a detailed history and photos of the classic American Diner. If you just enjoy Roadside Americana or a frustrated cook, this is the bible of Diners! I have repeatedly reread and referenced this dog-eared copy!"
1,dvd is a stretch ...,"This is an interesting concept for a dvd. There are no images of Dr. Fox actually playing the organ. There are some light shows which are said to be in sync with the music, and there are a few still images. If you wish to hear the music, it's a fine order. If you were hoping to see Fox playing, you will be disappointed."
1,These crackers are not gluten free,I received an email about gluten free products on sale and these crackers were included. PLEASE NOTE THESE CRACKERS ARE NOT GLUTEN FREE. SPELT IS NOT A GLUTEN FREE GRAIN. BARLEY MALT SYRUP CONTAINS GLUTEN. SPELT CONTAINS GLUTEN. YOU MUST REVISE THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS PRODUCT. CELIAC DISEASE IS A VERY VERY SERIOUS CONDITION. IF A PERSON WITH CELIAC DISEASE MAKES THE MISTAKE OF EATING THIS PRODUCT THEY COULD BECOME VERY ILL AND THE CONSEQUENCES ARE VERY SERIOUS. PEOPLE NEWLY DIAGNOSED WITH CELIAC DISEASE MAY NOT KNOW THAT SPELT IS NOT GLUTEN FREE IF THEY READ AMAZON'S DESCRIPTION!!!!THIS IS SERIOUS!!! REMOVE GLUTEN FREE FROM THE DESCRIPTION
3,Quality Control Issues Plague this Product,"It's a crapshoot with these crackers. When they're fresh, properly sealed and crisp, they're downright addictive. But lately I'm finding that 50% of the time, I'm getting stale crackers which taste like cardboard. Very unsatisfying. The company needs to address these issues to ensure that a fresh, light, crisp product is delivered everytime because the end result is excellent and will definitely have you coming back for more.. provided what you got was fresh to begin with."
1,gluten-free buyer beware,"In the product features listed the bullet reads ""great for the gluten-free diet"". If you have celiac disease do not eat this product. Both spelt and barley malt have gluten."
1,BUYER BEWARE! WARNING! NOT GLUTEN FREE,"Amazon claims that these crackers are ""for a gluten free diet"". The FIRST ingredient is spelt - which is wheat! It also contains Barley Malt. These crackers can make anyone with Celiac Disease, Gluten intolerance or wheat allergies very sick. Very irresponsible to promote these as great for a gluten free diet. Buyer Beware!"
5,Nice Watch!!,Just recieved the watch and I like it a lot. Big fan of Freestyle watches and went from a Shark X to the Hammerhead and I am really pleased! I have average size wrist and the band is on the third hole. So if you have a big wrist beware it could be to small for you. The head is nice and large easy to read- the bezel and outer face is a nice brushed nickle color and not to shiny. Has a good back light. A great watch so far.
2,Disappointed in the Quality,"I ordered this watch for my husband; he has very specific tastes but I was simply trying to replace a 10 year old Freestyle watch that no longer worked. I was disappointed upon arrival to see that the band was disconnected from the watch face. I attempted to reconnect it, and was able to snap the little pins back into place. But with a gentle tug they came right out again.It wasn't a hard decision to ask for a refund instead of a replacement, because the band also just looked cheap.(I ordered the Freestyle Immersion instead.)"
1,Bad Mouse,"After I purchased the mouse for 3 months. It does not work any more.During the 3 months period I had to change 2AA baterries every week.I would not buy this model mouse ever again. Besides the postage is too high.Sorry , it is a bad deal."
1,I hope you're not considering buying this mouse,"It's not worth it:Pros:It looks okCons:Button placement*Battery life**It has almost no battery saver feature****1 button is place where you almost has to 'break' your hand to press it**It eats tons of batteries... I've had this mouse for 1.5 months, and during that time it has used twice as much batteries than my previous mouse (cordless mouseman) used in 6 monhts***Whenever I turn off my computer, I have to take the batteries out of the mouse, otherwise there's no battery left for next day"
5,the best wireless mouse,"Have two of these, one in office and one at home. Great stuff. They work well and have not caused any problems unlike the microsoft ones whose buttons seem to get bad very fast with me. The rechargable battery is also great, and lasts forever. It has the right number of programable buttons and the scroll wheel also moves left and right. The weight of the mouse is heavier and fills the hand well. Integrates with MS Office, Firefox etc seamlessly.Perfect!!!"
4,Good experience,"purchased as a gift. although this was a duplicate gift, ret'd book with no problem and credited to my acct."
3,"Good bargain, but...","not suffciently precise for being an academic textbook. The definitions are sometimes incomplete, correctness proofs are missing, some exercises are incorrect. On the positive side, it does cover important topics, and brings good examples to illustrate main concepts and algorithms (which partially compemsates for the lack of precisenss)."
2,Technically brilliant but totally inaccessible,"While this is perhaps the best book on Hidden Markov Models in Bioinformatics available, you would do well to read Rabiner's review paper. For me this is the type of book that would put potential students off bioinformatics for life. It is too technical and uses inappropriate notation. It has too many ""It is easily shown"" phrases which means that actually the real proof would be rather involved. Dynamic programming is not explained very well.If you have a maths or computer background then go for it but if you prefer your Bio in Bioinformatics then stay well clear and go for Mount."
4,Great reference,"A great reference and a good introduction to many important concepts in sequence analysis. However, if you don't have a reasonable grounding in math you may struggle with the terse notation.Borodovsky's companion book is an excellent partner for this book. Get both."
1,WRONG MOVIE!!!!,Amazon didn't even send me the right movies! It has the name Kickboxer and Kickboxer 2 on the disc but when I put it in it was some other movie called Rain of Fire. Amazon didn't even leave me an email to file complaints with! Do not buy this movie! It's a rip off!
1,Wrong Movie!,The movie's I wanted out of the 4 disk set (Kickboxer and Kickboxer 2) were different movies altogether. They were not the movies. So total wasted purchase.
5,They got it right!,"My title refers to the previous comments on this set stating that the packaging contained the Black Mask/Bloodsport 4 movies but the wrong disc instead of the Kickboxer 1 and 2 movies. I wanted to add these titles to my collection but was real trigger-shy about hitting the purchase button simply because of the few bad reviews concerning ""factory error"". I decided to take a chance solely relying on Amazon's good Customer Service reputation and it paid off. The set contains 3 discs. The first being a 2 sided disc Kickboxer 1 and 2 respectively, then Black Mask has it's own disc as does Bloodsport 4. So go ahead the next time you feel ""nervous"" about making a purchase on Amazon because in the end they will take care of you if you're not satisfied. Happy Shopping! :)"
3,4 movies cheap and you get what you pay for,"I really only purchased it for ""Blood of Heroes"" and I haven't checked the issues mentioned in the other reviews. It is on dual sided DVDs which I am not real fond of but it keeps packaging down. The films are in 'Pan and Scan' format which I did not see listed in the item description and would have been a factor in my purchase decision. The image and audio quality is low so it seems it was taken from a ""modified for TV"" cut of the film. I paid $6.55 for it and I see it is now down to $4.99.Take your $4.99 and go spend it on something else."
4,Mr. Mom,"I'm 16 and I'm already a fan of Lonestar. They've got some of the best country songs in the genre.I just wanted to say that ""Mr. Mom"" is one of the best and most true-to-life songs I've ever heard. Whoever that person was who thought that the words were ""hilariously idiotic"" obviously does not have children and never had siblings.""Football, soccer and balletSqueeze in Scouts and PTA""(this is what my mom goes through every day)""And there's that shopping list she leftThat's seven pages long""(my mom spends $300 at Wal-Mart some days)etc.""Pampers melt in a Maytag dryerCrayons go up one drawer higherRewind Barney for the 18th time...""etc.It's all so true!!"
1,Basic By The Numbers Effort,"Lonestar has accomplished one stratigic plan, have all songs sound like they belong on Lonely Grill.Their newest album remains true to this belief. While it worked twice, it's getting a little tiresome not only for the ear, but even Richey sounds a bit bored as well.Basically watered down pop, with no fizz. Try Lonely Grill instead."
1,Total Garbage.,It didn't work and I wound up sending it back. I got a used Olympus Battery on e-bay which works fine.
1,Lenmar KITCRV3 Charger for CRV3 battery,Charger lasted 2 charges and than failed. Charger is not a universal charger and only charges proprietory CRV3 batteries. The picture is not of the charger that I received.
2,Excellent Charger--Limited Use.,"The charger is an excellent quality item,BUT it is limited to the use of the battery supplied with the unit.The way that the contact pin is set cannot be used with the NORMAL 3volt CR-V3 rechargeable battery.I had to make an auxillary unit to fit this unit in order to charge my CR-V3 batteries."
4,Lenmar CRV-3 Replacement Li-ion Battery and Charger,Takes about 2 hours to fully charge. Comes with a car adapter which really makes it convenient. I can get about 6 hours of shooting on one charge.
3,No multivoltage adaptor,"The batteries are great and the charger is ok. the only problem is that most probably you'll use it with some kind of portable device like a Digital camera, and if you travel outside the US or live in any other country of the world, the charger will be totally useless. It's real a pity. Besides that, it's a great deal, and the batteries last forever, you won't regret."
1,Keep looking!,"I took it straight out of the package, plugged it in for a charge. Charger never reached ""green"" ready but the battery overheated and melted several hours later.Customer Service was not the best I've had. Don't make the same mistake, keep looking."
4,Great watch for the price!,"This watch sells for $120 at the local surf shop. Amazon has it for $70!!! Can't beat that! The watch itself is great. The poly band will only last a year or year and a half before it cracks and breaks off. The rotating bezel will pop off if you drop it. It usually snaps back on, but will not click when you turn it, just spins. The watch looks great though. Just take care of it! Don't drop it, and don't expect the band to last you years! This is my third Freestyle watch. Just wish the poly band would last longer."
4,"Amazing Production, Witty Lyricism, and Guest Spots Galore!","I was really impressed with this album. The beats are crazy, Hochii rips the mic, and special guests include RBX, Ariano, Casual, & LMNO of the Visionaries. The highlight for me on this album is ""Death is a Bitch"" featuring RBX...it is a real banger, big up to LD on the production and cuts. Also on ""You Know Me"" Hochii rips the president, which is always great. On ""Ugly Stick"" we get to hear how Hochii resembles ""Gallagher twenty years ago"" and ""Dr. Phil's brother""...really funny stuff. Get this album if you like underground hip-hop...you won't be disappointed."
5,Great mouse pad,"The cat's claws don't get caught in this one. It is easy to write on. Only thing we don't like is that it makes a scraping sound as the mouse passes over it, but that's the trade off. The large size soft ones we had before used to get dirty - were hard to clean and the cat's would catch their claws in them."
4,Quality Product,"I ordered these mats for use in an office, for our conference room tables. I was pleasantly surprised when I received them. They look and feel quality (not cheap) and really add a professional touch to any conference room. Also, they are easy to clean. Quality product."
3,Don't know if it works or not.,"I bought it, but never used much of it. In hindsight, I should have thought this through before I bought it."
1,Dickason or Scripture--pick one,"Mr. Dickason admits that the case for the demonization of Christians (whatever that may mean) cannot be made from Scripture. That fact alone should be a BIG red flag.While the Bible does contain numerous examples of the demonization and subsequent deliverance of unbelievers, there is not one example involving a believer.Is this not an odd oversight on the part of the Holy Spirit, the Author of Scripture, if the demonization of Christians really is the danger many would have us believe it to be? Why didn't God warn us of this problem, as well as give us clear guidelines on how to deal with it? He did neither because it's a non-issue.I am forced to disagree with an earlier reviewer: I believe Satan DOES want you to read this book in order to trap you in the very fear-driven, demon-obsessed bondage folks like Dickason, Neil Anderson and others would presume to break!"
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money on this. The picture quality is terrible, the promised closed caption is not present. The movie is divided into 2 titles, which is unusual. Even the root menu does not exist. Some amateur tools would have produced a better result."
5,Fabulous !,"I remember listening to this when it came out.Marino on this and Strange Universe are his two best efforts imho. Very influenced by Hendrix but like Trower, Marino is his own man. Highly recommended !!"
3,Autumn of the Middle Ages,"Was looking for Waning of the Middle Ages and found this instead. Apparently it's a different translation of the original work by Johan Huizinga. The authors of Autumn claim that Waning has a lot of misinterpretations of the original text (albeit Waning was co-edited by Johna Huizinga).Autumn provides an insight into the life and times of the middle ages, leading into the Renaissance. The content is interesting, but the presentation is very dense and hotch-potch. The chapters are dilineated around a theme, but within the chapters the ideas are not structurally tied in a tangible sequence.Good book...but only for the serious reader with the fortitude to plow through it."
3,Overrated,"What are some of the words that come to mind when one thinks of the middle ages in Europe ?______ cold,famines,plagues,boredom,toil,superstition,religiosity ,fear,cruelty,wars,poor hygiene ,death,maudlin piety ,guilt, hell-fire,mud and mire, ,xenophobia,persecutions & pogroms etc etc . Prof.Huizinga does a pretty decent job describing all this.However I came away disappointed from this book because it is nothing but a compilation and collation of FACTS .There is little in the way of analysis and interpretation .From the rave reviews of this book I was expecting something more original & seminal , given the obvious expertise of the author in this area. Reading this book was a chore _____perhaps by reading this book the author wanted us to ""feel"" first hand what those poor ,illitrate peasants in the medieval villages must have felt on those cold,dark & seemingly never-ending winter evenings !"
3,Graduate-level exegisis of the unanalyzable,"Undertakes an impossible task: rendering into academic English the translated-from-Dutch- analysis of Latin and proto-French cultural aspects produced by medieval personalities whose dubious logic by our standards dwelt in the realm of denial of reality. (Everybody was crazy, persisting in their descendants in one European nation to this very day.) Long passages are quoted in French, translated in footnotes; the reader must know his Latin and the era's history and geography as prerequisites. Two translators produce oscillations between striking lucidity and marmoreal incomprehensibility, emerging from foggy double (triple?) negatives and run-on thoughts. Ultimately, the Worm Ouroboros devours its own tail here, to use an analogy for this Ph.D.'s take."
1,out-dated.,"Even though this book is a clasic, the main thesis of Huizinga is rather out-dated. Recent studies have shown that the decadence that Huizinga discribes isn't accurate -- none the less there was, no doubt about it, a crisis. So, I'm giving this book one star not because it's that bad, but because I think its neccesary to pull down the ratings it has; now a days it doesn't deserve them. Intresting reads for anyone intrested in the Middle Ages -- and that are more up-to-date -- are Jacques Heers ""The Invention of the Middle Ages"" and Jacques Le Goff ""La Civilisation de L'Occident Medieval"". Although these books can contradict each other in various points, the first one is intresting (although sometimes arbitrary) because it deconstructs the popular image that exists about the Middle Ages. The second one is intresting because it gives a general overview of the historical procceses that take place between the XI and the XIV centuries."
3,Read The Packaging First,"""PREVENT DEAD STRINGS,"" written on the two flaps that open the packaging (box) of this product, does not refer to the product's abilities as I first thought - it refers to how these strings should be installed. You have to rip open the packaging to find a detailed explanation on how to properly install these strings, or you get what I got - a perfectly tuned $2,000 guitar (with a tuner) that sounded wrong the first time I played a chord, and seemed to get worse. A quote from the inside of the packaging, ""Without the anchor the string is likely to unwind, go 'dead,' and fail to intonate properly."" Find out what the ""anchor"" is - prior to installation - or waste your time like me. Would have been nice if the outside of the packaging said something like, ""DO NOT INSTALL UNTIL YOU KNOW WHAT A PROPER ANCHOR IS."""
1,dismal,"The so-called literary quotations were culled from the same dozen or so writers and includes many duds nobody reads today (Mrs. Humphry Ward, Charles Reade--perhaps the most often quoted of them all). And even that's beside the point, since the quotations are always so short, often a single sentence no more than fifteen words long. As for the so-called recipes, they're just one or two paragraphs, running to no more than fifty, sixty words per entry (for both quotation and recipe), and they're completely superfluous. You get infinitely better recipes at the back of any cereal box. To put it another way, never have I seen such a gigantic waste of paper in so miniscule a book."
4,excellent movie.... Sheen is Blair...again,"For the 4th time... I believe , Michael Sheen inhabits the personage of Tony Blair in this version of the ""special"" relationship between the UK and USA and more specifically between said Blair and Bill Clinton. This was an HBO film and finally arrived on DVD in the US but this UK Blu Ray is worth sorting out if you enjoyed the film. For starters it does have some limited yet still bonus footage and behind the scenes material. However the most material difference is that this is cropped to 2:35 aspect ratio rather than the 1:78 that is presented in the DVD.... so you get the more cinematic scope and YES..this is a UK blu ray but it plays on my non modified player so it must be ALL REGION and NOT PAL.I hope this helps those of you wondering if you could play it and if it is any different from the domestic DVD."
4,New ideas,"Connell brought up some interesting ways of thinking about gender. Connell talks of gender how it is in a complex world. The book got better and more interesting as I got into it. The chapters are:1. The Question of Gender2. Schools, Mines, Sex and War3. Differences and Bodies4. Gender Relations5. Gender in Personal Life6. Gender on the Large Scale7. Gender and the Intellectuals8. Gender Politics.This book is a must for anyone studing gender subjects at uni, as well as anyone who is interested in gender. I thought his way of thinking was very much taking into account how complex people's lives are as well as how complex society is."
5,Excellent account,"Excellent account of this tragic plane crash. A great companion piece to the motion picture ""We Are Marshall"". Here's another interesting documentary about a plane crash from 1978Return to Dwight And Nile: The Crash Of PSA Flight 182"
3,This movie was a let down....,"When i read that this was Toshiro Mifune's final appearance as Yojimbo, or ""The Bodyguard"" I was extatic. I paid for it... waited and watched. sadly this movie has only 1, yes just 1 Mifune fight scene. And its at the very end.... i suggest buying the original Yojimbo, and if you already have, watching it again will be better than this. This movie isnt entirely awful, on the + side the story was good. All it needed was a few more Toshiro fight scenes. I recommend buying (if you can find it) Samurai Assassin, possibly the best story and action sequences of any Samurai movie."
3,"interesting, if you like this sort of film.","While Mifune is, as always, fantastic in his role here, some of the pace is quite slow, and the film is not terribly good from a technical standpoint, so for stretches there isn't quite a lot to keep you interested. Like other reviewers have said, this is no ""Yojimbo"". Even the sort of fighting the main characters do in this film is really simplistic, brawler sort of stuff. I would even go so far as to say it's not worth owning, unless you're a collector of samurai films (though this is hardly a samurai film)."
2,Disappointed,"My collection of asian movies would includes such fine filmsas; Curse of the Golden Flower, Red Beard, Zatoichi, TheHidden Blade, The Twilight Samurai just to name a few. Itwas with great anticpation I awaited my purchase of the movieIncident At Blood Pass starring Toshiro Mifune and ShintaroKatsu,however, the film turned out to be a HUGE disappointment!I found the film to be silly and without any depth in its story.I would not recommend this movie to serious viewers."
3,not a good choose,"I should get a different one then this, it has two more size of sockets and just a little more money and when I order from this seller it took then a month to sent it..."
4,That's good stuff there!,"This third season of Home Movies is really funny. I know that's probably the most cliche thing I could possibly say, but it's true! I think for season 3 they sort of revert back to the style of dialoug in season 1, which is the greatest! In season 2 it took me a while to get really into it, and at first I wasn't sure I liked it, but season 3 made me laugh within the first minute of the first cartoon! I wish the characters we meet in season 2 were more developed in this one, but there is some hilarious dialoug, and the ideas are very original. Why did I give this season 4 stars instead of five? Because I felt like it.Don't read too much into that- season 3 is VERY good! Buy it or you'll have to pay the price! (Michael Kluge did a beautiful job on his review-his is way better than mine so read that one!)"
3,a little disappointing,"Third season is not as funny as the first two, which i love!!All of a sudden in this season everyone is cussing at one another."
3,help me! I removed the black screw at first what do i do now?,"Just got this product, please help me I removed the black screw at first, now i can't assemble this piece what can i do?"
5,Over Bed Table,I was looking for a table like the one that was in the hospital and found it on Amazon.com.This table looks and works just like the one in the hospital so I couldn't be happier.It was easy to assemble and the cost of $49.95 and free shipping was well worth the money.For me it worked great and I would recommend this table to anyone.
5,Sturdy and Convenient,"I'll admit that I saw the other review about using this as a laptop table and had to try it out. This is a great table for that purpose. It was very simple to put together (a couple of screws and a couple of bolts later left me with a very solid surface), and it is perfect for my purpose. I basically am using it so that I can place my keyboard and mouse on the surface while sitting in bed or in my recliner to play computer games (I'm using a television as my main monitor right now). I love it! I can adjust it quite a bit height-wise to accommodate the chair or my bed. It makes a great night stand as well, which is what it really is meant for. The surface is pretty solid and arrived in perfect condition. Great product."
3,Trip Lever Needs Refinement,"Purchased this table for a relative who is mobile challenged. Table is replacing the use of an unstable TV tray. Have had to keep set screw in so the trip lever (height adjustment mechanism) stays put. Thought I placed an order for a secondAdjustable Non-Tilt Overbed Table / Hospital Table, but ordered this oneOver Bed Tablemistakenly. Once delivered, decided to keep it anyway because it looked so much like the previous (PT8603). Assembly, though not difficult, not as smooth as the Model PT8603, interior metal adjustment rod ""clangs"" when table rolls, and, as explained, above, the trip lever is unstable/does not securely hold the user's set height--table rises up by simply pulling opposite side of table."
4,mis-labeled part,"I figured not everyone got the same product. Mine has the black collar close to the top instead of the bottom as showing in the product picture. When assembling the table, if you find screw number 4 is way shorter than it should be, you are not alone. They mis-labled 4 with 14, just use 14 at the place the instruction says 4 and vice versa you will be fine.Overall, it functions as I expected."
5,Just What I Needed,Ordered this table for my mother who broke had a hip replacement one week and then had to have surgery for a broken femur the next week. Thus no weight bearing for at least 6 weeks. Ordered the over bed table one day and it arrived the next! Very easy to assemble. Took longer to unpack the pieces than to put them together. Works just as well as the table Mom had at the hospital and rehab center. I plan to use it as a table for my laptop when Mom is back on her feet.
3,Overall lowest height is quite high,The overbed table is good for serving food only over the bed. Its overall lowest height is more than 2 ft including wheels and if you are looking for multiple uses of this table say use while sitting on chair etc. then you need something of a lower height probably 1.5 ft overall height and not this one.
1,missing parts,"When I got the item, it was missing parts an did not work. I tried to exchange the item and was told a replacement part would be sent. I waited over a month, will sending many request for help. I never got anything. Tried to email many times, with no reply.I gave up after 45 days from order date. I took the table to a machine shop who made a part for the table.they charged $15.00, which I paid. As of today no reply or help from BP Medical. I will never do busness with they again."
5,Well Made Over Bed Table,"This was a very reasonably priced item and exceeded expectations on construction & build quality. Easy to assemble, nice heavy duty base,and nicely finished table surface. We use it daily and are very happy with this item."
5,"Great product, especially for the price, great seller, fast delivery","I wasn't sure how this product would be at such a low price but was amazed when it came in. I bought this for my dad who lives with me, who suffered a stroke a few years ago and is only 61. He is very independent but stuck in a wheelchair from paralysis on his left side. He is often a bit rough on things and figured it would only last a short time. The assembly was simple and my 6 year old son and I had it together in about 5-10 minutes (quicker without his help but not as fun). The only issue we had was because of the bed my dad has. The hospital type bed has steel frame low to the ground so the table would not slide under. However, my dad found a way to make it work for him and is very pleased with it. He leans on it from time-to-time to help him up and it's sturdy!The seller got this to us very quick and came in perfect shape! Will definitely use them again!"
5,Perfect,"I wish I could get this table many years ago for my cousin who was tied to bed for 10 years. She was so happy having it and last time I heard her appreciation just 2 days before she died. Sad,but the product is great."
4,"Read reviews b4 assembly - Also read ""entire"" assembly instr. b4.","Seems like a good value for the money. Have been using for a few weeks and it is exactly what i needed for a few hours of web surfing in bed at night. That said, if i had done the above two caveats would have saved time,frustation and the riser function would have worked instead of the situation now where i have to force it to the level needed - but since i use it only at one height that is a minimal problem that WD40 made somewhat easier."
4,Over Bed Table,Basically this was a good purchase. It did what I wanted it to do however the directions are very poor. It took much longer than it should have and I needed to keep walking away to refocus. I also wish if would go a little lower. Other than that I like it.
4,nice,"the mechanical part is a bit squeeky, so I need to spray with WD40 or something, and there was a mislabled screw on instruction. overall the product feel sturdy and rolles around smoothly. two of the wheel has break as well."
4,Very Helpful,"Pretty easy to put together (unless you have two grown daughters & a son in-law trying to help you out)Just read instructions, and it goes together easily. It's pretty sturdy, definately NOT a hospital quality table. But very nice for home use. You can pull it up to many hights, and use the hand release lowers. Fits well under bed. I really like it for a laptop desk over my bed. My husband has restless leg and thrashes at night, no problem with this flipping off the bed like the lap tables."
1,Big Mistake,"This was a big mistake....ordering this item....had to assemble using very unclear instructions....not user friendly at all....when finished, the table top raised itself to its tallest level and would not adjust downward...I am now stuck with a totally unusable five foot+ table....in order to return it I would have to dis-assemble the entire thing (somehow) and ship it back....I've learned my lesson and will not order anything that I would have to assemble myself....I will eat the cost of this thing....and donate it to charity if they will take it. Buyer beware."
1,THEY SENT ME THE WRONG TABLE!,"I ordered this back in August and it was great, I had no complaints. It was just as how it was pictured. It locked in place, was adjustable, and was easy to set up. I had to get another one of these so I re-ordered it, and they SENT ME THE WRONG TABLE. It is a different color and the lever is different. On top of that, it doesn't lock!!!!! Why would you make a table that doesn't lock? I want the table I ordered not this junk! I am giving this 1 star because they should have known to send me the right table. Also, it looks absolutely nothing like the photo so they are misleading their customers."
4,Nice computer table,"I bought this for my husband who likes to do everything on the bed. His notebook computer get very hot when put directly on the bed. But now, he can use it on this table over the bed! Nice! I should get another one for myself too though we use the same king-size bed. One bed and two over-bed table. How lazy we could be...The hight adjusting lever seems to be a little too sensitive, so I put 4 stars. But overall, I am happy with this product."
4,Nice overbed table,"This table is sturdy, attractive dark tone wood top with chrome legs. Wheels have a brake lock if needed. The table stays in position and adjusts with a simple latch on the side. Raises very high if needed. I only gave it 4 stars because the table is a little hard to push down and doesn't operate with almost no effort. Petty complaint - it works and works perfectly. Buy it."
3,Not as pictured,"This product arrived today. I have assembled it, and it appears to be a quality product. I would be completely pleased with it, but the table is not made as it is pictured. The supporting structure is not offset at the top and bottom as it is pictured; rather, it is completely symmetrical to the table center line. This negates the placement flexibility that the offset would provide, which was a selection consideration for me."
3,"Ok, does the job. Tip to make yours last longer","It's OK, does the job.Pro: Easy to put together. Easy to adjust height.Con: Not enough support under the table top - the small pitiful rectangular frame is too small to support the table top. I can see that it is not going to last.Tip to make it last longer: Don't throw it away if the table top ever comes off because you put to much weight on it. You can re-mount it back to another spot. Since the supporting frame is so small, there is enough surface space under the table surface to re-mount again & again."
3,OK....,The instructions and stickers/labels are horrible. I suggest reading some of the detailed instructions here in the comments before assembling. Got through assembly and pulled the protective plastic adhesive off the table top -- part of the finish and particle board came off with it. Table is a bit high when sitting on a couch or in a chair. Seems like it will work ok for the 2 weeks I will need it. Guess you get what you pay for.
5,Good value for the price.,This table was not difficult to assemble. It is sturdy enough to hold a DVD player with a small TV on top of it without any worries. Easy to adjust height. Highly recommended.
4,Good sturdy table,"Bought this for my husbands laptop, very sturdy works good. It is a little tall for use in a recliner unless you remove wheels. Better priced and sturdier than actual ""laptop tables""."
3,Fit and finish,The table manufacturing quality was sub-par making the parts not fit together as well as they should. Instructions could be improved also.
3,"Used it after surgery, worked well.",Easy to set-up. I loved this table when I came home from hospital. I use it now for computer work and other busy work. It kinda wobbles a little but I think the screw needs to be tightened.
4,nice table,"Not the easiest thing to assemble--directions are not clear. Once it's together, though, it's terrific, nice smooth operation and stable."
4,Warning: Different item,"This is an excellent product for the price. My wife used it while on bed rest, and continues to use it to study in bed or in the living room. Think I'll get one for myself. Like other reviews have indicated, the assembly instructions are dreadful. Thankfully, there are few parts and it's easy enough to figure out with just the diagram.UPDATE: I ordered a second table for myself. The original vendor no longer provides this product, and the new product is not the same! I should have paid closer attention when Amazon recommended it as an alternative. It seems to be a good product, but it is not the same as the one I wrote my original review for. This one does not tilt, and is designed to approach from one direction only (ie from the right side of the bed, not the left). I'm disappointed. Unfortunately, Amazon will not let me change my original rating."
3,"It's ok but not ""Invacare""","The table is ok but be aware it is not by ""Invacare"" as the seller claimed. The name ""Invacare"" is no where to be found on the table. I previously bought an Invacare table and love it so much that I decided to purchase another one without the tilt option. The table height does not lock so be careful when lifting it. My Invacare table locks at whatever height you set it."
4,"Very nice, could maybe use some lubrication though","The table works perfectly for my admittedly very high bed. The only complaint I can make is that it requires a decent push to get the table to go down. Maybe it will losen up over time though as I've only had it for a day. Overall, very pleased with it.I purchased it to use as a laptop table for bed so that I can have my mouse and laptop sitting up off of me. It works perfectly for that as it makes it a lot easier to play games in bed while my wife goes to sleep."
4,One of my favorites,"...if not my favorite. It's a short 11-episode series, the characters are so different and lovable and the plot is absolute adorable. I would recommend it for any age (besides little kids) even though it's apparently a josei story.Lots of cute, beautiful scenes, and the English voices are to DIE for. I absolutely love the dub- every character is perfect in my opinion.(Possible spoiler?)My one main complaint which I KNOW the reason for: the entire conflict is solved in the last five minutes of the series. Not only is it solved quickly; it's solved so simply that it was almost laughable. Not only that, but there never seems to be any ""main character romance"" resolution, either. Everything is left open-ended.This is due to the manga being ongoing, I'm told. I still don't take that as an excuse xDIt didn't manage to ruin the series for me, but you might see it differently."
5,Couldn't wait until this came out!,"I was really excited when this came out. It is an excellent anime that made me tear up a little, laugh my butt off, an be outraged at some of the characters.Now time for the actual product review. The box art is beautiful! It looks like a watercolor painting. Although I don't find the dvd/blu-ray combo pack very useful, seeing as how I only own a dvd player. Overall I'm happy with my product and would recommend it to anyone!"
5,amazingly heart warming,"If you know something about otaku culture in Japan, i'm sure you will be more amazed. Anyway, this anime series is heart warming, funny and so sweet!"
1,NOT yoga - more like boring physical therapy,"I like yoga and am more flexible than average, but my hips tend to be tight which is why I bought this video. I expected it to be a great yoga routine full of helpful hip poses like pigeon and ankle-to-knee seat. It did not include either one of those basic hip-opening yoga asanas - in fact it didn't really feel like a yoga routine at all. It felt more like doing boring physical therapy. Also you need to have props to do this video, including two blocks, a ledge at about knee height, another ledge about waist height, a hardwood floor, a blanket, and possibly a strap unless you are very flexible in your hips already (in which case, why are you buying this video?). Aside from all this, the video is just dull. I was incredibly disappointed."
1,Power of Praying Wife Journal,"If you buy the book there is absolutely no reason to buy the journal. Better yet, buy the study guide and just use a plain notebook to journal."
1,Shoddy book on Jiu-Jitsu.,Firstly DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!It is a very poorly made reprint of a public domain book and no care was taken in it's publishing. Stay away from this over priced book a total rip off. Shame on this publisher!There are other better and cheaper books on Jiu-Jitsu buy them and be glad you didn't buy this piece of garbage.
5,A Hilarious History of the Greatest Film Studio Ever,"Over the years, Troma has put out some classic movies, such as the Toxic Avenger, Cry Uncle, the Class of Nuke Em High, and the more recent hits Tromeo and Juliet and Cannibal:The Musical. In Troma founder Lloyd Kaufman's first (and hopefully not last) book, he describes the struggle (and rewards) of independent film making. It's freaking hilarious also. Even if you never saw a Troma movie (oh deprived one), this book is still enjoyable. Buy it now or you'll never know what you're missing out on!"
5,This Book was the best book I ever read.,"I have read hundreds of books in my life. Lloyds book is by far the best book I have ever read. I you want to know the ins and outs of Guerilla film making, this is a must read. It was hillarious."
5,BECOME A LOVER OF TROMA,"Did you ever consider getting involved in independent film-making? Well, here's exactly what NOT to do. Troma film and vidio, the oldest running indepedent film company has been keeping their heads above water for 25 years and none of them seem to know how they've done it. Join Lloyd Kaufman and the rest of the Troma crew for a hilarious adventure through 25 years of some great film making and some terrible film making. Did you ever wonder how to make green foamy vomit, or how they make those wonderful head squishing and decapitation sceens look so real on a nonexistant budget? I know you're all dying to know who played the bum in Rocky. Find the answers to these questions and get to know the Toxic Advenger by reading this book. If you didn't love Troma before, you will now! (After 3 days Lloyd remembered MY name.)"
5,READ THIS BOOK NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Listen i'm gonna keep this short,sweet,and to the point.This is an awesome book for anyone looking to fulfill their dreams of creating indie film,buy it and find out why.Don't be fooled by the negative reviews posted here some people are just already too brainwashed by mainstream nonsense to grasp Troma and the beauty of their independent films.I was privileged to meet Lloyd Kaufman last week at The Texas Frightmare Weekend in Dallas,and all I can say is that he is a genuinely great man who has transformed his dream into something we can all benefit from.Support independent film and support Troma Studios."
4,Truly inspiring,"In this book, Lloyd Kaufman, president of the impossibly quirky Troma Studios, shares insights and practical advice about making low-budget (or no-budget) feature films. Lloyd's writing style is just as unusual as the movies he directs, as he meanders aimlessly from self-deprecating autobiography to detailed, spur-of-the-moment instructions on how to fake an onscreen head crushing or make actors appear to vomit green foam. There's also plenty of out-of-place crude and scatological humor peppered heavily throughout. I wouldn't have expected anything else from Kaufman, whose unfathomably eccentric (but amiable) personality and genuine love for the art of do-it-yourself filmmaking shine through on every page. Fans of Troma, young and old, owe it to themselves to read this book. It really is an inspiring read for all of us who have the filmmaking bug but often become too easily defeated by lack of funds or crew members. Long live Troma!"
5,The independent spirit,I'm not so much a fan of Troma's movies as I am a fan of Kaufman and Troma Studios themselves. Interesting book filled with Lloyd's humor.
5,Very entertaining and informative!,"""All I Need to Know About Filmmaking I Learned From the Toxic Avenger"" is a funny and irreverent look at the world of independent film from Troma Studios' president Lloyd Kaufman. It blends important tips for indie filmmakers with amusing anecdotes and sage wisdom from someone who's been there. The reader finds out a lot about Troma movies that otherwise they would never know! I highly recommend it."
5,Lloyd is a GOD!,"Funny, inspirational, and informative- that's the three best descriptive words I can find for this book. Mr. Kaufman is a GOD in the eyes of those of use who have been TROMA-tized by his films. An excellent read, even if you aren't a filmmaker. If you are a filmmaker, Mr. Troma himself's book will teach and inspire, as well as tickle your funny bone. Thanks, Lloyd, for this peek inside the worlds greatest independent studio, and for insight into the mind of a mad genius."
5,A look into a world worth living ...,"I found this book at a used bookstore , during which time i was extremely depressed and hopeless. I began reading it and immediately started feeling a bit better , page by page i was begining to cheer up quite a bit.the book is an amazingly well written look into the world of tromaville , a world worth living in. lloyd talks about his obstacles in film making , his visions he couldn't escape until he makes his film and quite a bit of wonderful advice for any one wanting to make a movie. i've learned a lot about troma , lloyd kaufman and film making.Llyod kaufman actually suceeded in making a book that can keep up with the amaing movies of troma. the flow of the book makes it harder to sit down then most books. a wonderful slab of tree that would be a perfect addition to any ones book collection !"
3,Talent here is James Gunn,"I loved Tromeo and Juliet, and this book was just as imaginatively perverse and depraved. James Gunn's brilliant pen is the common denominator. I would recommend this to anyone who is compelled to plumb the depths of the viscera and the intelligent imagination (hallmarks of Gunn). I look forward to finding more of his stuff here and on the screen."
1,Save your money,"I love How-To books. I've read scores of them and have learned something worthwhile from every one. Except this one. It's 300 pages of self-indulgent, autobiographical rambling.I wanted to get an overview and some nuts-and-bolts insights into independent filmmaking. Instead I got Kaufman talking about himself, which is his favorite thing to do. It's not uninteresting, and he is a character, but where's the beef in the burger? It's all condiments and anecdotes about how clever and iconoclastic and offensive the producer is. Here and there he lets slip real information such as how much soundtrack editing costs per day, but most of this will only interest fans of Troma films.A really helpful nonfiction book will give you a bibliography at the end so you can find more information on the topic. Kaufman the salesman gives a 22-page filmography of Troma productions so he can make more money off you."
3,How You Can Beat the Races,This book is a bonifide trip. It goes into some handicapping principles but the information is very outdated. I would recommend it to a beginner maybe but I have reservations about recommending it to anybody.
2,Very dated techniques,"These approached for things are unfortunately a bit dated and I felt reading through the text that things were going to be a bit cookie cutter. With new practices such as normal mapping, specularity mapping and such, this book covers the most basic of steps in texturing without going into much theory about how to create procedural textures to a great degree of detail.I would recommend getting Digital Texturing and Painting by Owen Demers as your primer to interpret what you see in the real world and my school teaches and recommends 3D Game Textures: Create Professional Game Art Using Photoshop. The work I have seen the students in the game texturing class at my school is very impressive and it looks a much higher caliber of work than what could be done learning from this Dark Side book."
2,This book would have been awesome in 1998,"This book as really good basic information, although most of the other information is obsolete. Most texture artist(new or vetran) have surpassed this technology long ago. It's great read for the basics, but beyond that, their are better books."
2,Comedy gold,"David Franson does a fantastic job of showing aspiring texture artists how to strive for ever greater levels of mediocrity in this book, which amounts to little more than a printed compilation of the basic free tutorials you could find in 20 minutes of Google searching.The example textures Franson walks you through are pretty basic and lame, and the included images on the CD are hilarious by themselves. For example, a lot of them have a major case of flash burn or other serious irregularities that make them very bad source material for your own textures-no amount of cloning or doctoring can salvage a nicely tiling texture out of many of the images on the CD. You're better off building your own collection of source and reference images by searching for ""Mayang"" and ""CGTexture"" on Google.However, it is not without redeeming value-it's a great comedic read if you're a more experienced texture artist than the author. That bar, if this book is anything to go by, is pretty low."
3,Not bad for an old book written by a non-artist,I am a traditional artist with some photoshop skills. I am new to texturing however and this book is a nice beginners book. The techniques he shows are helpful if you are a texturing n00b like me.However the results he provides are so ugly that it is hard to be inspired by his efforts. OTOH it doesn't take much to create better looking textures than he does if you have any artistic training at all and use his techniques.When I say his results are ugly I don't mean that they look tattered and decayed - hey that's the whole point of the book. I mean they are poorly composed and executed.So while I am glad I bought the book I wouldn't pay more than $5.00 for it.
2,Dissapointment,"You better know photoshop before you buy this book,because the author doesn't tell you were some of selections are in photoshop. Plus after I managed to make some of the textures which did look good in photoshop, they looked terrible in Maya7 when I rendered the scene. Some of the textures I can not complete because I dont know photoshop that well and I have no idea what the author is talking about or were the selections are that I need to use..."
5,Merdeka Square,"When I was in Australia in 1998 I purchased and read all three books of the Indonesian Trilogy by Kerry Collison. I was so impressed by the books that I have been trying to obtain copies for gifts. The author obviously has inside knowledge of Indonesia and his ability to predict future events, some of which have since taken place, is remarkable.The books are well written and exciting. I rate them among the very best ""secret service"" novels that I have read."
3,an okay book,"But this book seems like a book that is more for children, it is written in very simple English, with graphics on every page and the lines are double-spaced.If you are an adult, then I would suggest reading more... informative books, or search on the internet for info."
4,Fairport at the Beeb,"For the many Fairport Convention die-hard fans out there like me, this 4 CD set is a treasure trove of gems recorded for BBC programs between 1968 and 1974. It covers a variety of the different lineups, but most importantly includes plenty of contributions by the immortal Sandy Denny, Ian Matthews and Richard Thompson. Judy Dyble is also there. It should be noted that the material released on the Heyday album is duplicated here.If you don't have any Fairport music this is probably not the place to start, but if you are a seasoned campaigner then this could well be for you"
5,Love it,"Love, love, love this book. Has been a long while since I bought it but I use it all the time for a good reference on diet and nutrition. Can't go wrong with anything from the Cooper Clinic."
5,The Magic Ok Nana Mouskouri,"With a clarity of voice seldom heard, she extracts the utmost from these selections...Her voice is strong,yet tender & loving..Range and timbre extra-ordinary...Great listening at home or on a sailing trip where I first heard the album. Highly recommended ...!"
3,NOT THE BEST ........BUT GOOD,"This recording is good but it is not the best version that your money can buy. There are some very solid performances here with Emily Loesser making a great outing as Sarah, and her real life husband Don Stephenson bringing the house down with his WONDERFUL rendition of ""Sit Down You're Rockin the Boat"". Ron Raines(of whom I am a huge fan) sings the role of Sky well because he is a fabulous singer, but he doesn't fit the role of Masterson at all. So in this area there could have been a better casting choice. Criswell is fine as Adelaide and the rest of the cast works well. So...this is a quality recording with two standout performances but you could use your money to but better such as the 92' revival or the New 2001 Maurice Hines recording."
3,Small - only a few horses will fit,"We bought this horse trailer, along with the Schleich 4x4 vehicle with driver, for our 3 year old son for Christmas. We also bought a couple more Schleich horses for him to go with the trailer.Be advised that this trailer is very small and only certain Schleich horses will fit. If their tails or back legs are at all extended, you won't be able to shut the trailer door. This has been frustrating for our son, as only one of his horses will fit.In addition, if you are considering the 4x4 vehicle, be aware that the doors pop off very easily. When my son tries to open them, the whole door comes off. Luckily, we have been able to pop them back in - however, he prefers now to just take both the doors and the top off."
5,"It's Schleich, what's not to like???","I purchased this for my 5 year old. She uses this with all her horses, her barn, and truck. Once she sets up she will play for hours with her 10 year old sister whom I purchased other Schleich items for. The quality of Schleich is fantastic. It is also so nice to buy something that is not a piece of junk that looks like some television show character. They can play without the drama that goes along with dolls like Barbies. I love SCHLEICH! The prices for the value is tremendous."
3,Too small for Schleich horses,"We just got this for my daughter who loves horses and she loves it. The problem is that she can't put her Schleich horses into it unless she removes the white top. She tried multiple different horses she had and they were about 1/4-1/2"" too tall to fit into it. We would have returned it but she love it too much. She just uses it without the top. One would think Schleich would at least size it for their own horses."
5,THIS IS GREAT LADIES OF ROCK THE 60'S PART OF GREAT LADIES OF ROCK BOXED SET ON COLLECTABLES,"THIS ALBUM CONTAINS 25 GREAT HITS FROM THE 60,S SEE TRACK LISTING AND SOUND CLIPS,IF AVAILABLE,GOOD SOUNDING,AGAIN I HIGLY RECOMMEND THIS DISC."
5,Very sturdy,"We have a mischievous Tennessee Walker who has torn down every feed trough we have built. This feeder had good reviews so we decided to give it a shot. Three months later and, except for some scratches, it still looks brand new. Plus, they travel well. We bought 2 more for the other horses. This is the way to go."
4,grandkids love it.,"Keeps the kids 4, 5, 9 content and quiet in the car. I enjoy seeing them so focused on something and bobbing to the music in their car seats. Makes for a pleasurable trip!"
5,Love it after all these years,"I started using Expensable when I started my own consulting company in early 2000. Still use it and love it. Of course there is much that could be done to update it to 2012 standards, but will use it until something better comes along, preferable with an app to my Iphone."
4,good shoes,"these shoes are very lightweight, you can get them nice and tight. support is so-soand they arent to squishy, kind of a hard innersole. these look terrible with jeans or any pants, but very good with shorts and a t-shirt. you might like the stealths or crazy-8's if you like these. blue and white is way better."
4,This TOEFL Practice Test Review,"This TOEFL test practice was given to a student in an Eastern European country, where she strives to excel in English. She has told me that this has been very helpful to her, so far, at this point in time. If she continues to speak well of it, I will re-rate this review at 5 stars."
2,Just for practice...archaic...,Include just few full tests with key. Audio recordings are on cassete format.
5,microrev_ak,It is an excellent reference for those who does not have detailed power generation and strong engineering background. It handles all necessary topics nicely.Astepe
4,Edward Gorey,A good puzzle even though the colors are slightly pale. Gorey's illustrations are wonderful and the puzzle is full of his whimsical characters.
4,Thoroughly entertaining,In addition to Brigit Bardot--here at her most charming--there are several exceptionally well-cast characters. And there is the clever plot. Everything about the movie is right.
1,Way too small,"These bowls are much smaller than I was hoping/thinking they were going to be. They look cute at first glance, but upon further examination, I could see that the glaze was cracking all over the bowls and there were weird bubbles in them on the bottom. When I put them in a sink of warm soapy water (which is what the box said to do) to wash them, one of them broke right in my hand and cut me. The other one I put in the water didn't break, but continued to crack and would have smashed apart with any pressure. I packed them up and shipped them back right away. The other interesting thing is that the website says they are dishwasher safe, but the box said to hand wash them for best results. So, these were cute bowls, but not of any quality that would last."
3,"Limited research, low analysis of Blacks and foreign policy.","Useful because the subject is so little covered, this survey of the role of Afro-Americans in US foreign policy from the '30s through '50s, is limited by its narrow research focus on individuals and by its shallow analysis. The discussion, according to the title, ends in the late '50s, although the author dips into subsequent years. This truncation of the subject removes the most interesting period in whuch U.S. Blacks have affected U.S. foreign policy from the book's scope. Upshot: only historians and specialists are likely to enjoy it. Among key figures missing: cartoonist Ollie Harrington (mentioned only in passing) and Charles Howard, the first and most influential Afro-American journalist to cover the United Nations."
4,This stuff really works,"I have severe arthritis in my hands. I rubbed this stuff on, and got instant relief. It is not greasy, absorbed well. It only lasts a few hours though, so I had to re-apply. But on days when the pain is extra bad, it takes off the edge and allows me to do things which would otherwise be difficult, like buttoning my shirt, tying my shoes, and writing with a pen."
2,OK on practical information but uninformed on history,"Though I found the Rough Guide to Egypt to be fairly good on providing practical information, its grasp of Egyptian history and culture was poor, much of it copied from other and better guide books."
1,no cigar,"An industriously put together guidebook but poorly informed and dull to read. It's not bad on practical information but hardly turns up anything really new or interesting that you can't find in any other book. More importantly, you do not really have confidence that its authors know much about the history or culture of the country, while what they tell you of the sites seems either taken from other and better books or is what you can see for yourself. No insight, in other words, no gleams of illumination. And it is so politically correct that it is worse than having gippy tummy."
1,A very poor account of my country,"Egypt is my country, I know it well, but I would not recognize it from what I read in this book. We are an old country, with a great history and culture. But this guide talks of McDonalds, of out of date pop music, of how to cheat my people by paying them as little as possible for their services and generosity. This book is an insult to my country, and I think only fools would waste their money buying it."
3,WATCH WHEN THE BOOK WAS LAST UPDATED!!,I used this book while in egypt. I found it to be very outdated and did not have much of the relevent information that I needed. I am normally a big fan of the rough guides but this purchase taught me the lesson that you need to be aware of when the book was published. I did not realize the book was nearly three years old when I bought it. If they have not come out with a recent update then purchase a different book -time schedules change rather frequently and the more uptodate the book is the better off you are.
4,A must have if you are going to Egypt,"I recently took a trip to Egypt, While there I had a copy of the Rough Guide, it was a real help and I could not have been able to stay as long as I did had it not been for the information that the Rough Guide provided me. I would highly recomend this book if you have any intentions of being in this area of the world."
5,Thorough and accurate,"I spent about a month reading this guide and the Lonely Planet series while planning my trip to Egypt... Well, they were both OK, but the Rough by Dan Richardson is way more detailed and has more practical info on fees, schedules, hotels and workarounds if something goes wrong. Through the trip (Hurghada - Aswan - Luxor - Cairo - Suez - Hurghada) the LP was what I read in the evening before going to museums or tombs and RG was what I carried around in my pocket through the day. My estimate is that I saved not less than fifty times the cost of this book just because I knew most of the prices and situations in advance, before bargaining :)A must have for travel in Egypt"
3,Interesting experience,This book gives one a better understanding of the drug life and playground of Las Vegas. The writing gets a little overwhelming.
5,A Must Read,"I had to read a lot in my 20s to catch up on the lack of knowledge and literary exposure that I received in my childhood and through much of college. And, if I were to take my younger self aside and give him a list of must read books, this would be at the top of the list. I'll give you three reasons why:1. Voice: There is only one person that could have written this book. You know it from the first page and you know it until the last page.2. Pacing: Sure, this book is about men that are completely whacked out of their mind. But have you ever listened to a stoner drag on and on about some topic? So don't take the pacing for granted.3. Style: To call Hunter Gonzo is a compliment. Too often we now see journalist call themselves ""gonzo"" but they never quite capture the style and the immediacy."
5,A classic,"I read this first in college, and then again recently. It's still just as funny and wonderful as ever."
3,"reality, what reality?","This strange, drug-addled treatise treats Vegas with the contempt it so richly deserves. Not for the faint-hearted, Thompson and buddy simultaneously drag the gutter and live the high life fueled by an elephant-stupefying cocktail of practically everything. Ralph Steadman's contribution shouldn't be overlooked as his cartoons add humor to some of the most vilely decadent sections. Read it in a single pass to get the most from it, preferably while slumming in a cocktail lounge."
3,Torn,I'm torn between loving this book and being bored to death by it. The drug induced craziness was fun but I guess I wanted more out of the book. I kept thinking there was a deeper story that could have been told. Dissapointing.
2,"Look Mom, No Couth!","I guess a lot of people might be shocked by all the drug use in the book. Mostly I just found it self-indulgent and tedious. This is your basic story of two guys badassing around, 70s style. Really not much different from Animal House or any other frat story. It is a little ruder than F. Scott Fitzgerald and not as glitzy as Less Than Zero. Not badly written, and yeah, Vegas is ugly and scary, but this book is just too impressed with itself. Any claims of deep social commentary or other insight are vastly overinflated."
2,Largely Pointless,"I put Hunter S. Thompson on my reading list this month, since I haven't read anything book-length by him before. Sadly, I found Fear and Loathing to be mostly pointless. Undoubtedly, Thompson is a gifted writer; in the hands of a lesser talent, Fear and Loathing would be ridiculous rather than merely pointless.The plot, such as it is, has been noted in other reviews so I won't attempt to recount it here. Fear and Loating reads like a poor man's Tom Wolfe. Thompson and his lawyer run around Vegas getting outrageously stoned and doing crazy things. Near the end, there's a fairly laughable attempt to make serious sense of the 60's drug scene, with some sort of quasi-justification of Hell's Angels founder Sonny Barger.Is Fear and Loathing really bad? Not really. There's just not much of a point. It's another hopelessly dated, overhyped drug era entry praised by the same critics who still think Pynchon's relevant."
1,A journey of futility,"I was terribly disappointed by this book. It was obvious that the author decided to put in, almost as an afterthought, a point to the entire waste of precious natural resources. I am amazed that this book is still in print. It has little to offer as a story--humorous or otherwise--and I was dumbfounded that someone actually based a movie off this book."
1,HORRIBLE BOOK!,"I could find absolutely nothing of ""redemptive value"" to this story. I thought there might be a some kind of ""lesson"" to be learned at the end, but that wasn't the case. No consequence for illegal, immoral choices and actions. A tale of debachery, disrepect, drug use promotion, vandalism and total hedonism. I'm not a right-wing, Bible-thumping, ultra-conservative, but I could not, would not recommend this book to anyone!"
5,A crazy trip with a scary truth,"Hunter S. Thompson has written one of the best descriptions of the American Dream in his novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. The visions he sees through an ether binge are more accurate that what you are going to se on the nightly news. At least he is telling it how it is. A serious, funny book."
5,A book with a True point,"This book is, in itself, a modern classic that should be required reading for anybody interested in the 60's and early 70's. Many people see this book as one gigantic drug trip with no meaning, though they are wrong. By the end of this book I realised that Thompson's goal (having been achieved successfully) was one not unlike Arthur Miller's in ""Death of A Salesman"". Thompson shows the death of the American dream by the hands of Nixon, and the death of the hippie counterculture. It is sad and tragic that Raul Duke and his lawyer must fill themselves with as much drugs as possible in order to escape the reality that the once cool underground acid scene, which Thompson believed to be ""good and beautiful"", had withered away, and died unsuccessfull in its attempts to change the world. It belongs on the shelf next to ""On The Road "" and ""The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test"""
5,"Brilliantly funny, vicariously scary","This is such a funny and well-written book, you almost forget the underlying tragedy of the time depicted. Thompson's ability to describe events, places, and people is nothing less than miraculous, given how addled he was at the time. No one has ever nailed our culture with such a sharp eye."
5,"""As good as The Great Gatsby...""","As Hunter Thompson said himself about ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"": ""It's as good as The Great Gatsby and better than The Sun Also Rises"". This statement is not hyperbole or shameless self-promotion, although it would be prudent to expect both from this author. Thompson created a masterpiece of American Literature when he wrote this book, one that deserves to be read (and studied) side by side with Fitzgerald and Hemingway. (""Vegas"", of course, has the added benefit of being side-splittingly funny.) There's more good writing on one page of this book than in a stack of contemporary best sellers.If you have never read this book, do yourself a favor and buy it now. If you haven't read it in more than 10 years, you need to re-read it."
5,"Amazing, entertaining, and appalling Biography","One of the best books I have ever read. It is a stunning story partly autobiographical, but largely a biography of the 60s and 70s drug generation. A must read!!!"
5,A truely wonderful pick,This book will crack you up until you finish the last page!!! Completely reccomended!
5,"The bible of our generation,and all that that implies.","If you were there, at the time, you know it's all true. It's the best book written on what happened to us. Very funny, yet so sad because it's all so true. You must read this book. END"
5,great book,"anyone who rates this book below a 5 star is crazy, it might be the best book ever written, just read it."
3,A disappointment,"I had heard so much about this book that I had to read it. While there were some entertaining bits I was slightly disappointed that the author didn't make his condemnation of drugs a little clearer. Look, I'm no square, drugs are a fact of life and therefore an issue open for discussion in literature. But I do believe that authors such as Mr Thompson have a duty to their readers to stress the dangers of drugs so that they can then make an informed decision not to take them. That's really my only gripe apart from the sick illustrations."
1,i missed the boat,"I just did not get this one. The whole anti-establishment, negative view in the 60's did not come out of the book for me. It just read like a couple of idiots on a party binge with each chapter a copy of the last. I am a party person too and just did not think their antics were that funny. Maybe I am too young to enjoy this story. Not for me."
3,Let me forget about today untill tomorrow!,"It's a good book yes, you get alot more out of it if you have some prior experiance with the various narcotics they take throughout i would think. I don't only weed but that helps you, say, 'get it' alot more. Don't read it, get the movie instead, it was a marvelous adaption and all almost the entire narration is taken from the book. Im not totally certain if this author is still completely sane, i saw him on conan o'brian and he seemed somewhat reminiscient of the current ozzy osbourn"
2,Where's the beef?,"After reading many of the excellent reviews on Thompson's book I decided to purchase it. I tried liking it, and sometimes did, but overall I don't see the point. I wanted to take something away from the book, whether for better or for worse, some type of message - unless I totally missed it, no message at all. Two druggies, always high, rambling on, no direction and again no message. I would not recommend the book - waste of time and money."
4,a laugh-out-loud classic of drug-addled gonzo journalism,"I never particularly cared for Dr. Thompson's other works, but this book is a laugh-out-loud classic of drug-addled gonzo journalism. I try to keep two copies of this book on hand so I always have one to give to a friend."
4,"""The Book is Always Better Than the Movie!""","A fine literary, if not literal psychological journey to be undertaken. This book proves that you get more out of an experience if you read about it rather than view something about it. So, don't be another one of those people who watches the movie and thinks they know the whole story. It pays off if you read the book. You get more out of reading the book than you would have ever gotten out of the movie. The book is always better than movie."
3,"Boring, sometimes funny, confusing, good pictures.","This book was quite hard to read and didn't have a ""smooth flow"". Although sometimes funny, this is one of those rare times when I rate the movie BETTER than the book.... funnier. I still encourage everyone to at least try it, however. E-mail me anytime."
5,Hunter is The Man,I have probably read this book a dozen times since the 1970's. I keep having to buy it asI always give it away for friends to read. Even after reading so many times and knowing whatis going to happen next I still have to put it down for a few minutes several times while reading until I stoplaughing. This is a classic.
3,old america,Fortunately this era of gonzo journalistic style has passed. Nearest Englich example is Train Spotting.I haven;t found anything to recommend in this article to others.
4,Brilliant but Flawed,"The first 50 pages of F & L are the most dynamic I've ever read. I laugh out loud every time I pick up the book. Alas, the force, fury and humor wear out as Thompson descends into drug-induced madness. Perhaps a bit too long, but the great writing in this book really drives me through. Thompson changed the face of journalism with F & L, and the form has never recovered. Taking the personal, the confessional, the delusional into the real of so-called non-fiction, Thompson make a post-modern melange of words that vibrate manically. To my mind, this book is his best, creating a persona that Thompson felt obliged to live up to, and many others too. Gonzo is fun, but it has costs too. You can find them in this book, as well as late 1960's paranoia about the right (justified, oh, justified), a solipistic view of the world and personal enlightenment through chemical abuse.Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"
4,Pure Hysteria,"Wow .... what an interesting read. From the beginning paragraph to the end it is one of the most convoluted books I have ever read. This book really is ""A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream."" Thompson and his ""attourney"" do so many drugs in this book, you would think that they were madmen. However, on this strange trip it's is Thompson's madness that carries him through his dangerous adventures, it's almost like a catch 22. I would recommend this book to anyone that is mature enough for the contents. Thompson may be no ""Hemingway,"" but he has a knack of giving us a different perspective, as valid as it is skewed. Perhaps this is key, to understand and survive in a mixed up world one must be mixed up. Thompson's brilliant imagination (or perhaps reality) will propel you right through the book which is easy 1 or 2 day read. Have fun with it."
2,Fear and Loathing review,"Purchased as a gift to replace lost book that was original first edition copy of this book. Paid like $26 for paperback book that was advertised as original first edition printing. Was not as advertised. Was very disappointed as was recipient of book. Am sure now that original copies of this book are no longer available, but that's what was advertised."
4,Alright,"It took a long time for my book to come, but I have it now.There are some red marks on the edges of the pages when you close the book but it doesn't matter to me.None of the pages are missing as I can tell, so thanks."
4,WARPED!!!,"If your mind is a bit skewed, you will adore this book!!!! The first half of this book is just stunningly twisted--in a totally hilarious way. The second half kind of unravels, which I suppose is the only possible outcome, but it's a bit too real, given the first half farce. All and all a great look into the egomania of a wasted adventurer"
2,BFD an intimate portrait of burnouts on Holiday,"So this book is just a 200 page hallucinogenic drug fueled anecdote about going to Vegas to write about the Mint 400. Big deal. There's nothing more to it. If you are vaguely curious about what goes on in the mind of a hallucinogenic drug user, this is for you. It's NOT funny nor is it deeply introspective. It's just two old hippie burnouts getting ""freaked out"" all over Vegas, irritating everyone around them, the reader included. It got old really fast."
2,Overrated and too Pro-Drugs,"This book started out good but after a while you get sick of reading about drug after drug, trip after trip. I expected to read a masterpiece, but instead I was throughly dissapointed. Other drug books (such as Clockwork Orange) have worked in so many more ways. This one just didn't quite cut it."
5,Funniest book from the 60's,"You Gen X ers who get high at Starbucks may not know abouta true American journalist and hero, Dr. Hunter S. Thompson,and his voyage, like Ulysses, into the belly of the beast,(Las Vegas) and his attempt to make sense of our criminaljustice system (pre-OJ and Ito) by attending a Conventionof District Attorneys, with nothing to protect him but acache of illegal stimulants, high-powered weapons and his300 pound Samoan attorney. Before the Internet there wasactual reality, which Dr. Gonzo tweaked like no one else.Read it and weep, laugh till you cry."
4,Thompson takes you on a wild ride you wish you'd gone on,"Though I thought this was a good and very hilarious read, it wasn't quite as good as I expected it to be (based on other reviews). The book is based on Hunter S. Thompson's (who recently committed suicide) trip to Las Vegas. Along for the ride is his lawyer and an amount of drugs that will make anyone's mouth water. The book takes you through their crazy schemes, some of which are only able to be recounted because Thompson is carrying around a recorder. Otherwise, his drug induced state would have never allowed him to recall these escapades.Don't read this book if you're against drug use, it will probably offend you."
4,fear and loathing in las vegas,"great book, it keeps you reading and wanting for more. i liked it from start to finish. way better than the movie. it is the perfect book to read when you are bored or for school. highly recomended!!!"
2,Artless and Gratuitous,"I grew up in this era and there were so many misunderstandings about drugs it wasn't funny. Now we see some of that ignorance played out in an 'adventure' of sorts in this book. I found most of this to be utter nonsense. The protagonists are juvenile and proud of it for some reason. I can appreciate adventure as much as the next person, but this is more like stupidity raised to a absurd level. At any rate, now I know I do not like the writings of Hunter S. Thompson. Nuff said."
3,I don't see what the big deal is...,"As a recent college grad with time to kill unemployed, I wanted to like this book, I really did. Many of my friends have recommended I read it, although I am beginning to think they never read it either. I had no problem putting this book down, and was kinda relieved to get to the end of it. Don't get me wrong, the book certainly had its high points and interesting twists and stories. But for the most part, it was jumbled and fell far short of the legendary status it is given. Maybe I missed or couldn't relate to the drug culture of the 70s, but I could never quite grasped the preoccupation with finding the American Dream. With that said, I didn't waste too much time. It takes maybe 4 hours to read, but I don't expect to have any urge to re-read it like some other books."
1,This book is retarded,"I have no clue as to why some people like it. I'm going to assume it's either becauseA) they're jumping on the bandwagonorB) they're fans of drugs.Either way, this book sucks. I thought it would be much, much, much better because I enjoy some of Thompson's personal quotes. But, it was terrible and virtually pointless. A waste of time and it should be thrown in the trash. Go read Plath, instead."
5,Great book on the waste of the 60's and 70's,"Hunter S. Thompson delivers a knock out blow with Fear and Loathing. He details each and every illegal drug possible used in the ""great"" 60's and 70's. With Dr. Raoul Duke behind the wheel and his attorney, Dr. Gonzo pouring beer on his bare chest for the purpose of tanning, one can't go wrong when reading this book. WAIT!!! WE CAN'T STOP HERE, THIS IS BAT COUNTRY!!!!"
4,The search for the American Dream.,"The American Dream is the unreachable pie in the sky. Most people believe the American Dream is a good home, two kids,and a two car garage. For Hunter S. Thompson the american dream takes a violent twist into the world of drugs. Thompson persues his dream through the use of drugs, free money, and fabulous cars. Where does he look? None other than the hell hole called Las Vegas. A place where millions are made and lost ever minute. Thompson goes on assignment to the Mint 400, the baddest motorcyle race ever known. This race is the dream of every biker, but it's not Thompson's dream. So on a new assignment Thompson infiltrates pig heaven in the National District Attorneys Drug Conference, but this is not his dream. Does Thompson ever find his dream? Who the hell knows?"
5,The DVD times 100,"This is one of my all time favorite books and got me into reading post-highschool reading adgenda. If you intend on ever reading any of HST's books please make it this one and i guarantee that it won't be the last you read by him. I will admit that this book is not for everyone, but neither is Hunter in my opinion. However, if you have seen the movie and liked it, it is like the DVD director's cut with added scences and more, or have an interest in the man or his works, please read this. You cant go wrong."
5,A XX Century Classic,"Into Savage America and it's Heartless Dream. A must read for anyone that thinks sanity is a given in modern day XXI Century. Funny, witty, marvelous, insane sanity, creative and imaginative. No wonder Terry Gilliam did da movie, which by the way is as good as the book itself..."
5,A Modern Humorist With A Twist,"A different take on the standard buddy travelogue by Hunter Thompson, a writer who who provides a dark humor filled romp out west. It is not for those who frown on drug culture books, or those who cannot find humor in such things due to the subject matter, much in the same way that many do not like Cheech & Chong routines or movies (not trying to compare this to them, but more for the general idea)But if you are not offended by those types of things, and do not mind some crudity in humor from time to time, you will be laughing throughout this book as he weaves a tale through drug induced senses. It truly is a modern classic."
4,definantly want to read it over again.,"the book is hilarious in the beginning and end, a bit hard in the middle, but still humorous."
5,Oooh really good...,Is this the greatest book of all time?Short answer: YesLong answer: OHHWWWWWWWW YEAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! (in Macho Man Randy Savage voice)
3,trippy...,"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas chronicles a twisted journey through the funhouse reflections of America's playground; of two men careening frenetically around the city in search of the American dream. In the midst of a narcotics induced frenzy, Hunter S. Thomas elucidates on the ultimate ""light at the end of the tunnel"" - Vegas, with its turn-a-blind-eye mentality and distorted surrealism represents the extreme materialization of their sought after American dream. A haze of hallucinogens scripted and bound into a literary milestone of the dope decade, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a statement of skating by on the edge of insanity, continuously attempting to circumvent the ubiquitous demons of Hunter S. Thompson's consciousness."
4,A drugged up adventure.,"The first 1/3 of the book was unusual and helped set the tone of what I was reading. The second 1/3 of the book was awesome as I am now experiencing the warped adventures with the characters. By the final 1/3 of the book I was burned out and did'nt even read the last 30 pages. The book is just like a powerful drug expereince. At first what's happening, then the full buzz, then the burnout. Not the best, but a worthwhile read if your in the mood."
4,"Bizarre, and confounding, yet quintessential","This is a great piece of literature that poses many questions about the nature of being an American.The book is broken up into two parts, and part one is clearly the strongest. In book two, Thompson loses focus and begins to drift. The story attempts to take on several metaphorical resolutions, very few of them powerful. If Thompson had kept the intensity of Part 1 throughout the text, this would have been even more groundbreaking than it already was.Part 1: 5 StarsPart 2: 2.5 Stars"
3,What the....?!,"First things, first...the late Mr. Thompson's earlier published book about the Hell's Angels was highly entertaining and informative. Well worth reading. As for ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"", well, that's a different story. There are a few funny moments, but for the most part the author and his attorney sidekick just come across as self-absorbed, drug-addled A-holes. The book is kind of like driving by a horrible car accident that you just can't seem to tear your eyes away from looking at the carnage. A potentially useful book if you want to discourage someone from taking drugs. The reader is exposed to a boatload of cruel and irresponsible absurdity. There's nothing remotely romantic or positive about the adventures in this book. Maybe that was the point."
4,The anti-Gatsby,"Hunter Thompson and his attorney were high before they left California. On his first assignment for Rolling Stone (to cover a stock car race in Las Vegas), Thompson and his pal spend a harrowing week in Vegas, stoned out of their gourds on mescaline. They falsify their identities, lie their way into a police conference, and deflower young virgins -- all in the pursuit of an American dream that they wind up concluding died with the dope culture of the 1960's. As tragic as Gatsby, though perhaps better when you're high."
5,AS YOUR ATTORNEY I ADVISE YOU TO READ THIS BOOK,"After experiencing an incredible movie, I had to see what the book by Thompson was about. I came to the realization that everyone needs to indulge in the masterpiece known as Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas."
3,infernal literature,"Hunter S. Thompson has quite a unique style of writing. My initial reaction to the book was positive, but after I let it settle in my mind for a while, I was a bit depressed. It's disgusting how depraved the activities described in this book are. Overall, I would say that it is a well written book, but not very uplifting."
2,Don't believe the hype,"Read Hell's Angels instead of this one. His earlier books are subtle and brilliant, where this one is maniacal and completely ego-driven. In addition, Thompson himself has admitted that it is fiction, and not the product of a crazed junky's prodigious memory. Take it from a Thompson fan, it ain't all that."
5,The Feel Good Book of the Year!,"One of the most colorful books I have ever read! Love the satire, and the illistrations! The most accurate account of a ""trip"" I have ever read! Hunter, is this centuries number one writer, kudos!"
5,Hunter S Thomson is the Best,I loved this book !it was definetly worth reading and ill read again anytime.ALSO READ FEAR AND LOATHING ON CAMPAIN TRAIL 72!its the second book and if you liked this book youll love this one.!
2,Hunter S. Thompson is Tom Wolfe with half the talent and a drug problem...,"This little book is mostly self-indulgent tripe, with childish illustrations thrown in. Thompson writes a lot about drugs, drink, sodomy, Nixon, and what a WILD AND CRAZY GUY HE IS! That Hunter S. Thompson...""Dr. Gonzo""...what a CHARACTER! Read it so you've read it, but don't think you're getting anything the caliber of Tom Wolfe...good Lord, no."
2,How did this book ever get so much attention?,"I bought this audiobook because I heard so much about the author, and I got the impression that this was an important work. Instead, I discovered a rambling mess, in which the author describes two pathetic drug abusers, stumbling around Las Vegas. It had no structure, no beginning, middle, end; instead the characters wandered from one insipid misadventure to the next, all caused by their drug stupors. ugh."
5,Jamie,I havent read the book yet but im deffently going to. I saw the movie and it was grait. HST is the graitest author ever and Johnny Depp and Benico Deltoro are the graitest actors ever! I hope the book is as grait as the movie.
5,He da man!,"Hunter Thompson is a depraved lunatic. Totally off his trolly. If your dealer is out of town and left you high and dry, read this book. It's the next best thing to being stoned outta your gourd."
1,To Hunter S. Thompson- get over yourself.,"I couldn't get past the first few chapters. Thompson is like that annoying friend that thinks all the stupid things he does are hilarious and make him ""cool"".I find that the best way to make reviews helpful is by adding a list of books I love and books I hated. That way you can compare and determine whether you and I have similar tastes. So here is my list:Books I love or at at least really, really like:We Need to Talk about Kevin.Tell the Wolves I'm HomeWhen the Emperor Was DivineThe History of HistoryThe Remains of the DayWe Have Always Lived in the CastleThe Night CircusWater for ElephantsThe Sisters BrothersThe Poisonwood BibleBooks I REALLY hated:The Bear in a Muddy Tutu1Q84The Buddha of SuburbiaA Visit from the Goon SquadSun StormA Long Way DownWhen We Were OrphansThe Haunting of Hill House"
5,Finally some music I like that doesn't scare girls away!!,"I typically listen to music that is so raw that I'm afraid to let my dates listen to it. I end up putting on some kind of Coldplay or Ben Harper or something else that I can only half-way enjoy. But I tell you what ('cause people from Indiana tell people what)--this CD is a piece of work. There is a rawness that comes from musical innovation that doesn't leave its roots hanging in the air like a tree blown over by the wind. Each song is wonderfully written. There is nothing lacking on this album. I am confident that this will become one of those monolithic albums people talk about for a long time. I've been listening to this album non-stop for the past couple of weeks, and it's defining this time in my life. I can count about three albums that have done that for me since high school, some 14 years ago."
5,Front Porch Sophistication,"This music is deceptively simple and that is probably what makes it so brilliant. So don't let the initial impression fool you into thinking this isn't an amazing effort. Oliver Wood's guitar playing is straight-forward and direct, and it is the bass playing of Chris Wood that lays down a subtle and almost sneaky sophistication that elevates these songs musically. That's not to say that Oliver doesn't make an important contribution, his vocal and guitar timing and the space he leaves is impeccable, as are his smoky vocals. Add great lyrics to the mix and there isn't a dud on this CD. That's rare these days. Top it all off with production that walks a fine line, retaining a front porch feel while offering clean, crisp sound with out that over used, modern sound that sounds so manufactured. This is a fantastic effort, don't miss it!"
3,not what I expected,"According to the main review, the sound of this album is supposed to fit into some type of ""Modern folk and blues"" category. Along with the rave reviews, there were even comparisons to Leon Russell, Tom Waits, and Dr. John? Sounded great to me, maybe something refreshingly different in this age of digital duldrums. But I tried and tried to get into this CD and it just didn't do it for me. I don't hear anything remotely resembling Waits, Leon or the good Doctor. Maybe the Wood Brothers have so many influences that they just can't hone it all down to a single defined style. Not that that's a requirement for making good music, but nothing on here is what I would call distinctive. They are obviously very good musicians, but most of these songs bore me."
5,Sonic and musical masterpiece,Bought this on recommendation from a hifi forum to which I belong. It is wonderful music and the sound quality is fantastic. Exceptional recording. Great songs with deceptively simple arrangements.
3,art and a tiny lesson in a misunderstood youth subculture,"First of all this book is not written as some far in depth account of skinheads, it is a photo journal. Knight is a talented photograher and this book should be put into spectrum as an art book, who's subject is an almost lost subculture. Do not buy this book if you want a grand tale of the non-racist skinhead movement and evolution. Also when looking at the photos be prepared to keep an open mind, past preconceieved notions. If you like the book check out Gavin Watsons Skins, a very similiar book, less writting but more photographic talent. Also if you want more knowledge on the truth behind skinheads, try reading Spirit of 69, a Skinhead bible.In rebuttle to another reviewer, all skinheads are NOT nazis now and there is a growing rebirth of the non-racist subculture."
3,"Interesting, but dated.","Nick Knights book is an interesting (mostly a photo-journal) account of Skinhead life in England in the late 70's early 80's. Other reviewers noted how the book gave a good account of ""non-racist"" Skins, but I noticed plently of photos in the book showing obvious National Front members. In the end, the book is probably ideal only for people within the sub-culture itself. The text is a bit weak, and much, much to short. The photos concentrate a bit to much on style and most are posed. Still, all in all, the book represents a nice snapshot of Skinhead life in Britain back in 70's and 80's."
2,Dissatisfied,"Too many of the stickers aren't sticky at all and need to be reinforced with glue, which totally defeats their purpose."
2,Not the product shown in picture,"I wanted the product that was in the picture, but unfortunately I did not get it. I got a bunch of pastel stickers of dolphins and bugs. Now, I didn't mind so much since they were still ""crazy creature,"" but I did want bright colored stickers, NOT pastels.I won't be purchasing again."
5,20 Years Ahead Of Their Time,"Happy the Man is one of the best Progressive Rock bands. This album is fantastic. BUY this CD along with ""Crafty Hands"" and you will not be dissapointed."
1,I would think twice.,"This recording has the same problem as a lot of the more obscure American prog albums, and a lot of the newer prog like Spock's Beard. The musicians can play, but the lyrics and vocals are just embarrasing and they ruin any kind of vibe that could have been achieved. To compare these guys to Yes, Genesis, etc., at their peak is to have missed a lot of what was cool about those bands. It really sounds like the singer is the wimpy hippie teacher from Beavis and Butthead. Get Relayer instead, or if you have all the more well-known prog recordings from the 70's, get into some of the Italian bands from that period or Magma or something."
3,amasing and all that silly hype,"I should have considerd the other reviewer who said that Happy the man was overated, he was correct. these guys can play I`m not questioning that but the level of musicianship is not the highest i have heard set by the United States prog arena.If you want to hear true masters try early Star Castle or early Kansas. Look I hate to bag bands but these guys just don`t live up to there reputation of being amasing and all that silly hype.But thats not to say I don`t like them because I do.To be totaly honest with you I found the CD commited one of prog rocks worst sins it was (BORING) good but boring."
3,Intro to dreamtime,"I'm finding it an interesting but not an engaging read. I can hardly put down Smith's other books. This one I pick away at, often when I'm wanting to get to sleep (and dream my own dreams)."
4,Great addition to Canongate Myths series,"Dream Angus by Alexander McCall Smith is one of the books of the Canongate Myths. I've only read one other book in the series, The Penelopiad, by Margaret Atwood, and I truly loved it. I enjoyed this one as well, which is a retelling of the myth of the Celtic god of dreams and love.The book starts out with the tales of how Angus came into being and grew up, and then it has separate stories, alternating between modern and ancient times, of Angus and his doings. One of the stories seemed a bit harsh, but in most of them Angus was a giver of good dreams, enabling people (and sometimes animals) to come to peace with their situations.I really enjoy Alexander McCall Smith's writing style and I love myths, so I was very happy to read this book. Since both of the books I've read in this series were very enjoyable, I may branch out into the other installments of the Myths series as well."
2,Wrong direction,"This book goes the wrong way, namely East to West. The book follows the old 1976 Bike Centennial trail that is well described and updated at the Adventure Cycling website. I followed this route, East to West. It would have been a lot better to have gone West to East. The wind gets pretty strong and it blows West to East; so, if you are riding East to West, you have to work much harder than if go would go the other direction. While I enthusiastically recommend the route, I suggest that it would be better to start in the West; if you do, it is better if your guide book goes the same direction."
5,instant decorating,A great no-sew decorating book! Lots of quick and easy ideas which won't break the bank.
2,"So much potential, such disappointment","John Krasinski is definitely the only redeemable part of this movie. Nothing happened. At all. Just a lot of waiting around. The end was interesting though. If the rest of the movie was like the end, then it could have lived up to all the hype."
2,Not Very Good,"I only purchased this movie because I worked on the set when it was filming. There are some random scenes that are good, and John Krasinksi is great. But overall, very cliched, too long, poor quality, and boring."
2,Boring,"Dull, droning, generic rock with way too much distortion for its own good, makes you wonder if they have any alternate setting on their guitars... I wouldn't recommend this album, but if you are into that standard, overdone and overabundant form of rock then you may enjoy it."
5,A good collection of handy tips,"Typically majority of car owners take care of their cars through specialized licensed mechanics. The book not only offers a useful collection of tips on how to handle various problems one could have with the car. Also it teaches how to distinguish between serious problems and not so serious ones,as well as what questions one may want to ask a mechanic in case they show an outrageous list of deficiencies. Finally, the 2009 edition seems to be a reprint of 1992 edition as both have the same ISBN number."
3,Not a two way dictionary,"In any foreign language dictionary we have ever purchased in the US, it is possible to look up words in either language to get their synonym in the other language. The cover doesn't have to state that it is a Vietnamese-English AND English-Vietnamese dictionary. That is usually a given.This book is only helpful to those trying to find a synonym from Vietnamese to English. Evidently the lucky writer of the last review knows every word in the Vietnamese language and, therefore, never has a need to translate from English to Vietnamese."
4,Best of late Charlatans,"This CD definitely marks a return to the Charlatans I love. I have all of their CD's and I would put this in the top third. If anything, because of the first two songs (Blackened Blue Eyes & NYC). Other favorites include Muddy Ground, the Architect and Road to Paradise. The songs do tend to be slower than on past releases but who is to say that is a bad thing? They are not ballads, they are just a little slower paced. My one problem is with Sunset & Vine. While definitely not a bad song, I was expecting more from an instrumental. I think this was a good example where they could have sped things up a bit."
2,Not You Slighty Elder Brother's Charlatans . . .,"There is now no trace of delight left in this band. All songs are either moderately slow and somewhat self-indulgent or frightfully slow and quite self-indulgent. I do love this band and pronounce praises upon them whenever I receive a doe-eyed look saying their name, but this CD and the CD previous (which did have 1 tune, ""Apples,"" with which one could smile) does, for the first time, take away any anticipation for their next collection of chopfallen tunes.First, we loose the Roses, then the Ned's disband, following that, Swervedriver breaks apart and Velocity Girl is gone forevermore. Now my Charlatans have become charlatans of the great band they once were."
5,The cool way to Backpack,"I highly recomend this Backpack, it has compartments for everything you need, and is very sturdy. can keep a 6 pack or 2 litter cool for hours."
2,Pitifully pedestrian,"This was the first book by Ms. Trollope I have read; it will be the last. I guess this is what might be referred to as a woman's book. But it is certainly not every woman's. The dialogue was deadly dull. There was nothing in the characters which came alive for me so I couldn't care about any of them. The subject of dysfunctional families can be handled with empathy and drama even if one hates the protagonists. I was simply bored by all of them principally because of the pedestrian writing devoid of emotion stirring descriptions. They were all cardboard figures. If you want to read about troubled familial relationships treat yourself to ""The Correction"", by the brilliant Jonathan Franzen. Even if you hate some of the characters they are unforgettably alive. Maeve Binchy is another gifted author who writes convincingly and with humor and sympathy about families. It's hard to understand the rave reviews for Ms. Trollope."
4,cd labels,"I've purchased in my country these labels, I've bought already 2 packs and they are OK, the print out comes out good and the glue is hard enough to hold after a couple of years"
1,Cheap,"I must say I was very disappointed upon receiving this blanket. The quality was lacking and it was very thin, so I sent it back!"
3,"Good, but couldn't find the essay I was looking for","I wanted to read the essay where he states ""Be not the slave of your own past. Plunge into the sublime seas, dive deep and swim far, so you shall come back with self-respect, with new power, with an advanced experience that shall explain and overlook the old.""....I read and reread his essays and couldn't find this quote. I thought it was from the essay self-reliance, but couldn't find it. If I overlooked it, please alert me as I really want to read the essay where this infamous quote is from."
5,More About Marjorie!,"I never tire of reading about Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings. I loved The Creek by J.T. Glisson and Idella, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings' Perfect Maid. And this book, Sojourner at Cross Creek, gives even more details about the interesting life of the author. Anyone who is interested in Marjorie Rawlings books really must go to see her house and farm in Cross Creek, Florida... and by all means, you must read the book Cross Creek before you go!"
3,Good but not great,"I agree with those who said this collection is good but not great...a comedown from the first volume. For most of the stories, I was thinking, ""This should've gone into the miss or near-miss pile, not the 'best of 4,000 entries' pile."" Even the prize winners I would've sent back with a note saying, ""Great idea, but needs a little work."""
2,So What Went Wrong !,"I really enjoyed the first volume in this series of fan written stories, but am now asking myself what went wrong with volume II ! Gone is much of the excitement, gone are the engrossing characters, and almost gone are the ""Strange New Worlds"". Instead the bulk of stories in this volume are the kind of insipid, weak, soap opera drivel, that has turned many fans away from Star Trek over the years. I realise that a certain percentage of the market buy into that but I don't accept that it is the majority. If things continue down this road the stories are likely to begin with : ""Like tribbles through a transporter beam ... so are the days of our lives ! """
3,DUMAS MALONE DID A BETTER JOB HERE,"Despite his clear sympathy for the late 'sage', Dumas Malone did a better job on this book, when compared to his efforts on ""Jefferson and the Rights of Man"".This book, (""The Sage of Monticello""), centered on the ex-president's life after retiring to his grand plantation. It is a well-written account, although that I disagreed with the author on certain issues.Yes, I may seem stubborn, but I will always like to be conscientious: I refuse to agree that a man who was a slave-holder was at the same time, the champion who fought for the rights of men. It is simply contradictory!"
1,:iggage,"The shipping box was slightly crushed on arrival. One side of the large piece of luggage was also slightly bent, which showed how poorly made the luggage was. Very little side support."
1,Beware!,"I read the reviews and thought, they can't be that bad. Well I should have listened. The fabric is nice, however the zippers get caught and you have to back track a lot, and the pull bars don't come out on all of them. this company sent the product with no invoice and no return label. These suit cases are only used for overnight trips now and will never see the inside of an airplane. I will never buy form this company again."
1,Nothing,Ordered this LAST week. They would be delivered by the 14th /19th. TODAY I got a email that they cancelled .NO reason and OO my creditcard was not charged. (tsjaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa)Never will buy from this one again
4,Denine: It better be continued!!!!,"This album is by far the best freestyle CD by Denine. With combinations of old school and new school freestyle, it is a sure hit. This album is very mystic and, it brings you back to ones true Freestyle roots. 2 Thumbs Up!!!!!!"
1,Stupid,Well above explains it all. A waste of perfectly good time and money. If I were to buy this movie I would first have to shoot myself for wasteing the money on this over-priced waste of space.
3,Entertaining,"From the looks of the movie trailer for this film ""prototype x29a"" , it appears rather comprehensible to want to see. It may have some weak points that are not giving the film a full boost. But, I believe that this picture is even more outstanding then the sci-fi/hor ""Aliens""."
4,Good low budget Sci-Fi,"In the spirit of Arcade and Evolver, it's a good SciFi. The story line makes the movie more than the special effects."
3,Not as good when new,"I bought this one to replace the 14K gold rings i had. I downloaded the charts for size and ordered. The order was processed fine and they looked very good when arrived, were comfortable too. But after about 5 months of use, there are scratches and the shine is gone.I would want to try the tungsten carbide ones sometime, they are supposed to be scratch resistant. But platinum is platinum and my wife wanted this one only, so I will wear a scratched and less shiny ring."
3,Not for today's cheerleader,"This book, while helpful in some ways, is not ideal for today's more active and athletic Varsity or All-Star cheerleader. I would definitely reccommend this book for less competitive squads, like Pop Warner or J.V. Beginning cheerleaders and new coaches may find this book useful. But personally, with five years experience, I didn't learn too much from it. Instructional videos or competitions on ESPN will benefit competitive cheerleaders more. The tumbling section has detailed pictures of performing a back handspring, and some of the spirit/fundraising ideas are good. The stunting pictures are very outdated, and could use some updating. There are very few free-standing stunts, basically everything is old-fashioned pyramids. The basic stunts they show are pretty innovative, and would be good for Pop Warner cheerleaders. If they revamped this portion of the book, I would give it a higher rating. GOOD LUCK AND HAPPY CHEERLEADING!"
3,The book was OK.,It was okay and it tought me how to do alot of jumps and the cheers were good. It didn't show the moves to the cheers. It didn't tell you how to do the lifts. It didn't even tell you how many people you needed.
1,cant review what wasnt received.,"Didnt ever receive it. Maybe a mail error. Didnt miss it because I ordered another cheer book at the same time and it proved to be extremely useful. I was doing research and for a class, forgot to complain about the missing book. No sleep lost though, thank goodness it wasnt expensive."
1,It was not very good.,"This book did not help at all. It is completely outdated and un-interesting. The moves are hard to understand, the chants are all from at least a decade ago, and it doesn't do a very good job of showing how to become a cheerleader."
2,This book is way too outdated!!,"I think this book was a poor display of cheerleading! and as for the Bradleah chick who read this and thinks she is a ""really popular cheerleader"" get a life! cheerleading doesn't make you popular, and with an attitude like that, you won't get far in life!!"
3,DVD release is disappointing,"The Kino DVD edition has poor sound quality and is out of sync. And the video quality is not that good either. This DVD is substandard, especially for the price. Let's hope there is an improved re-issue someday. In the meantime we can enjoy Cacoyannis' other mythic films, Electra and Iphigenia (both of these are better than The Trojan Women, anyway)."
3,"Some excellent performances, but it never really gelled","There are some excellent performances in this production of The Trojan Women, but the picture never comes together as a whole. It's stilted in parts and very stagey. The best scene is the mock trial with Irene Papas (fabulous as Helen of Troy) and Katherine Hepburn (in a good turn as Hecuba) arguing what should be Helen's fate. If you're a fan of Bujold, Redgrave, or Papas you may want to watch this for their performances, as none of these actresses has a scene together the scene selection makes it easy to just see the actress that interests you (Hepburn is in the whole movie). Otherwise, you may feel like you are watching a homework assignment."
3,A Play on Screen,"This is really a play on screen. I didn't expect it to be like that, but it was. It was taken word for word from the play and put onto the screen. Because of this it's a bit awkward for the casual viewer who may not know what's going on at all. The version I had also had no captions so you could even follow along and my mom couldn't watch it with me, even though it contained one of her favourite actresses Vanessa Redgrave, because she didn't know the story. So for that be warned.The acting is well done though. Along with Vanessa it stars Katherine Hepburn, Irene Papas(as a none blond Helen, which was refreshing) and Genevive Bujold(who was in the film Anne of a Thousand Days with Papas, which was fun for me since I love Tudor films along with Greek films). The film tells the story of what happens to the important women after the sack of Troy. It's not a story often told, and should be told more often, but not in play format."
1,Worst movie I ever saw. Its a tragedy for sure.,"A greek tragedy alright. This is THE WORST movie I ever suffered. I walked out about 3/4 through, tired of waiting for it to get better.It's awful. Skip it entirely.**Zero stars."
2,Were these coveralls sitting in the sun?,"I ordered these for my boyfriend. The sizing chart online was incorrect. While the first pair was beautiful, they were too small. So we sent them back, waited almost 10 days (the first pair were one-day shipping and still took three days). We were disappointed when we opened the replacement. It appears that the coveralls were folded and left in the sun. The top 2/3 were faded several shades lighter than the legs with a noticeable fold line. Since it was such a hassle to exchange the first pair, we opted not to return. But for the money, we should have received something that looked brand new and not something that was sitting somewhere fading away."
2,Frustrating,"Playing around with the beat is one of the things that makes Jazz what it is, but as far as I'm concerned, Steve Kuhn ruins an otherwise wonderful date by playing too far behind the beat too often. Too bad."
2,Go with quality cleats.,I have a Porter Cable pneumatic flooring nailer. When using Bostitch cleats I've never had a problem with the nailer. It has worked flawlessly. Recently I decided to try B & C Eagle cleats because they were more economical.I was nailing a hardwood floor in a room that was 120 square feet. While nailing the floor the flooring nailer jammed five times. Two of the times required dismantling of the nailing head. Plus I had to pull up one of the boards that I had nailed down.Since then I've gone back to the Bostitch cleats. They work flawlessly in the nailer and I highly recommend them. I don't recommend the B & C Eagle cleats.
3,Not her best,"love Tec's work, and own almost all her books. this book did not match her previous ones. in a way as some of the interviewees feared, it trivializes the holocaust to break things down by gender. to truly analyze gender, one would need to take men and women who had been through the same life crises during the holocaust and then compare and contrast their responses. it is not the same to compare a male who has lost his career, livelihood, dignity, and home with a female who has lost her home. it is a rare individual who will not react to public humiliation at least for a little while. the only section i felt came close to the depth of her previous work, was the the chapter on passing in the gentile world which is the manner in which Tec survived."
3,just okay,"Small enough to keep on the bike without bothering, the pump is pretty bad tho. After 60 lbs of pressure. You have to use all your force to try to put more air. Soo imagine the struggle to get too 100 or more psi. but I guess if your stuck with a flat, This pimp can become a life saver."
2,"Great Pump, A keeper Only If it works","When I got this pump I was impressed. Quality, design, and Material was superb.However the pump fail after 1 day of use. the valve lock refuse to lock on.I'm sending it back to Amazon for refund."
4,very good for a mini pump,"I've bought it because it is small, lightweight (170g), works with both presta and schrader,and because it has a pression gauge (which I think is very important).I've used it many times and it seems to be really robust, so I believe/hope it will last for a longtime.Until 60 psi it's reall easy to inflate, and also it does it really fast (because it inflates when pushing AND when pulling). From 60 to 90 psi it begins to get REALLY hard... And after that is a pain in the ass! So if you need to put MORE than 100/110 psi I would NOT recommend it (that's why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5).ps: I never used it mounted to the bike, so I cannot talk about it."
5,Great Pump,"Took me a while to figure it out. Most pumps im used to lock when you flip the latch down, this one locks when you flip the latch up. It inflates on the up and down stroke. I used it on my Mtn bike all the time. (i have a presta valve bike)"
3,it is ok,the produst is in good condition but the truth is that is a liltle bit unconfortable. the shiping was good and everythis i guess is just that they are not made for me.
1,Terrible!,"My wife bought me these boots as a Christmas present. She ordered them about a month before Christmas; when I opened them and tried them on I found them to be too big. Of course we couldn't exchange them for a smaller pair because they don't take returns after 30 days.So I stuffed them with insoles to make them fit. I only wore these boots for about six months before I had to throw them out. I am a police officer, so the boots get used pretty hard, but I've had Wal-mart boots that lasted longer. BOTH soles had completely worn down; it's a good thing I had the insoles in them because that's what I ended up walking on! The zippers had broken, one heel had split in half, and no amount of waterproofing agent would help keep water out. Terrible boot for any amount of money. Will not buy Western Chief product ever again."
5,One Of The Best Movies I've Ever Seen,"This is now one of my favorite movies. Yes, it' true that some parts might be a little hard to believe, but isn't that true for just about every Hollywood film???I give it 2 thumbs up. I'd give it 3 thumbs up if I had an extra hand."
3,Novel Concept That Doesn't Deliver,"In the recent stream of mainstream Hollywood, the plot line is quite novel - however, that's where the difference ends. The movie quickly decends into typical, brainless fluff. The few ""twists"" in the plotline are so clichéd that the movie is entirely predictable. MacGregor did well for the script he was given and it was honestly the first movie I've watched with Johansson in it and I was decidedly non-plussed with her performance.The DVD's special features are only barely adequate for a new release. I believe a lot of DVD collectors look for unique views into the industry by way of the special features and for a sci-fi type movie, I would have imagined more behind the scenes features, deleted scenes, alternate endings...something."
3,Fun-filled typical action summer blockbuster.,"This movie is quite an entertaining, non-stop action ride for the summer. It has so much crazy, over the top action, to bring your summer action fun right in your face.Nobody can direct an action movie like Michael Bay. With a track record like: The Rock, Armageddon, Bad Boys, and Pearl Harbor, you just know he can deliver the goods.One thing that is quite unique that not all action movies have is a deep storyline. This futuristic/sci-fi thriller about clones and deception really is amusing to watch. As the story builds in the first 30 minutes, you reall as though you're not going on and you have to rely on Ewan McGregor's character to guide you in finding out how what happened in the world and why these people are sealed in this facility.The story is quite intriguing and when the plot turns into a huge, action-packed, effects-filled thrill ride, you'll be smiling in your seat with total enjoyment."
3,1984&Brave New World meet Coma and end with Logan's Run,"This is a pretty entertaining movie. I think it will make some who are all for cloning and its attendant technologies a bit squeamish, but that is part of its purpose, just as the 1978 movie ""Coma"" raised similar questions for transplants. The movie has basically two very different parts. One is a kind of scifi mood piece and the other is an extremely hyper (even preposterous) action flick. Does it work? Well, as I say, I found it enjoyable, but not enlightening.If you think of the movie as opening with a kind of 1984 - Brave New World that then transitions with Coma and then finishes with an adrenaline fueled Logan's Run, well, that is about it. It is well done for what it is and has a couple of touching moments. However, they are hard to feel because they are small cupfuls within barrels of crashbangboom.So, if you just enjoy it for what it is and, sad to say, don't think too much, you can have fun with this movie."
5,Great action movie!,"I've been waiting for a long time for this movie on blu-ray after seeing it in HD on cable many years ago. It has the perfect mix of plot, action, effects.Watchout for the price thou! Could be an import!"
3,What Can I Say?,"Throw together a little bit of James Bond, a little ""Logan's Run"", a little ""AI"", a bit of ""Amistad"", a controversial political topic, a whole lot of action, a hot Scot and a blonde bombshell, and you get....um....an OK movie. The plot is interesting: what if you ran into your own clone?? What if you WERE the clone, and ran into the ""real you""? Interesting concept that could have filled up two hours better if you took out a lot of car-crashing, helicopter-crashing, motorcycle-crashing, and futuristic aircraft-crashing. Plus the coy ""product placement"" was very cheesy. They go to a phone booth, and ""MSN"" is displayed prominently. He makes a call on a private picture phone, and ""Nokia"" is displayed, large as life. Same style logos as they have now, in 2006. What makes them think the logos will look exactly the same in 2050?? Won't they consider them antiquated?? A fun but silly little film."
2,Disappointing,"I waited a long time to see this movie. What I got was cliche's and product placement. The critics were right to savage this piece of warmed over science fiction pap in their reviews. It started out good and then the story runs right off the tracks and became 'big Hollywood', 'blockbuster, predictable nonsense."
1,Awful DVD edition,"I think the movie is great but this DVD Edition really is ufuwl no extras at all and no DTS, its safe to say that in the near future it will come a ""Special Edition DVD"" or ""Collectors Edition"" or ""The Ultimate Edition"" or something like that, so if you really like this movie like I did, just wait a couple of months to buy a better edition."
1,Awful!!! Don't waste money on even renting it!!,"Michael Bay is just not my kind of director. I hated this I hated Pearl Harbor and what i saw of Armageddon too. This was a waste of 4 bucks at Blockbuster. First of all, the plot is cool but it's boring, confusing, and just... stupid. Ewan McGregor is alright I guess and so is Scarlett Johannsen but this film really was not good. Probably the worst movie I saw all year. The action wasn't even fun in this. If you want to give this film a chance go ahead but I'm warning you, it's not very good."
4,Worth the Blu-ray price,I really do not have time to write a detail of a movie that most people have seen and probably liked. It was great fun in DVD and even more so in Blu-ray. I was able to notice certain things that Hollywood will need to address in the future like the scratches on Scarlet Johansson's face were visibly put on with some kind of clear tape. I could see the edges and the clear portion of the tape.Highly commendable in BD
3,No bad...,Not a bad movie... I would not pay more than $10.00 for it but not a bad way to spend 90 minutes or so.
2,A pastiche of sci-fi films...,"The Island is a pastiche of themes and characters straight out of favorite sci-fi films dating back 30 years. Engaging camera work, motivated characters, high contrast saturated color, Scarlett Johanssen's supermodel pout and cool highway mayhem make for a fun picture, but you too will soon be counting hommages. Look for themes and actual scenes from Logan's Run, Blade Runner, Gattaca, The Terminator, Superman, Batman, Invasion of the Body Snatchers and THX1138. The nod to Life of Brian is a real hoot. (Even ""the holy grail"" is mentioned, but that would be a stretch.)"
4,surprise! a really good movie,"actually i was a bit surprised, because i didnt expected much from this movie, when i found good actors in a good storry. Its a bit to much action in it for my taste but at least its done with style and skill. So its worth at least 4 Stars.But im sorry to say the DVD is not, one pathetic little extra, that is really under average. I bet the studio bosses thought, because it didnt did that good at the box, a better DVD is not necessary, that is kind of lame."
3,Moderately entertaining sci-fi; one too many chase scenes,"This movie fits into the ""genetic manipulation"" subgenre of sci-fi, in the tradition of films like Gattaca, Equilibrium, and Code 46, although with more of an action-flick slant, like one of Schwarzenegger's sci-fi pics. It does have its moments - a few interesting scenes and ideas. Overall, though, it was too long, with a storyline that doesn't always make sense. I actually found it fairly boring at times. And there is a heavy use of product placement all throughout the movie, usually gratuitous and not serving the story at all."
2,WAY TOOOOO much product placement,"The plot is interesting, as well with the special effects. But I found the movie was ruined by the blatant and obvious product placement. Xbox logo in the ""Facility"" game room, aquafina in their bar, like the clones even know or care! What a load of crap. I enjoyed the first half of the movie, but after that the storytelling kind of fell apart. Add to the injury the fact that these idiot companies think people care if their crap is in a movie, definitley turned me off to this film. DONT waste your money, just rent it...and laugh at the commercialization of what could have been a fine film."
3,Nice Effects and Music,I don't think there was anything really innovative about this movie. It has the same feel as Minority Report as far as the special effects and mixing technology into our modern urban landscape. Ewan and Scarlett give believable performances as naive individuals with the minds of 15 year olds. They movie is overall enjoyable and I think the score is beautiful.
2,Could have been a great movie,"This movie has a really interesting concept of human clones being made so people can extent their life by replacing their aging body parts with cloned ones. The clones have memory imprinted in them so they are pretty stupid and just believe what they are told. But some of the clones got smart and began to question everything about their existence. Ultimately, two escaped from the facility that housed the clones. The company that makes the clones must stop them at all cost. This is where the movie falls apart with one car chase after another. At this point the whole movie turns from an intellectual and intriguing one to a mindless action junk filled with explosions and car chases. Unless you are a testosterone-filled teenager, there is not much to see here."
5,Spanish subtitles?,From those that already bought the blu ray movie the island. Does any one know if it has spanish subtitles or spanish audio?Hope someone can help me because is for a gift for a friend in mexico.Thanks
4,A nice mix of Sci-Fi and Action,The first part of this Michael Bay movie is a mysterious Sci-Fi tale and the second half has great action set pieces. The casting is great with Ewan and Scarlet in the leads. Looks great on the PSP.
4,Excellent movie to see!!,This movie was great one of Michael Bay's best movies. This movie gets you thinking. Excellent music and stunning visuals. Uses real crashes not like other movies which use cgi graphics crashes. Will not disappoint. Also watch the commentary.
3,The Island on DVD,I love SciFi so was happy to add 'The Island' to my collection. Cast is great and story isn't complicated for confusing.
4,Better than expected,"Yet again, another fine effort from Ewan. I enjoyed the level of action and stuntwork. Let's not forget about Scarlett, quite the hottie... a decidedly stronger role than her ""Lost in Translation"" character. I recommend this movie to most sci-fi folx."
2,Deserved to fail,The movie was so bad that the projector was affronted enough to blur the last quarter. The last I saw of it before leaving to pull the projectionist out of his crap game was Ewan McGregor and Sean Bean (in another thankless Hollywood role) hanging from the ceiling. I wasn't too bothered which one dropped. I give this a star for Scarlett Johansson's lips which I wanted to do things to. I think you have to have a licence though.
2,This movie belongs in the 70's,"There is very little in this movie that was not done in the 70's. (and I LOVE those movies) Back then, however, these conceptions of futuristic dystopia were relevant to the times. i.e. They were extrapolations of Communism, or technologies that were new then. What would be interesting is a dystopia based on trends occurring in our society today. How about a population kept in a continual state of war against some vague threat or concept. A time when one megacorporation has swallowed up all the others and we're left with one company that sells all products, makes all the food, controls all the media, and we all work for them in a world of saturation commercialism and brainwashing. Of course since these movies are made by such megacorporations and are filled with product placements, it would be against their interests to make such a movie. Plus, we already live in that world anyway...."
3,ok movie,"The problem I have with this movie is Michael Bay!The story is pretty good but the action (typical of Michael Bay) is tv quality. Given the considerable budget for the the filming. The action could have been better choregraphed! But knowing Michael Bay, he does a second rate car chase. Overall, the first half of the movie is good up until the car chase scenes, which they should have someone else direct this part. The fist part is intriguing. But they should develop better,newer action scenes. The car chase scenes in this movie we have already seen on tv. With a budget of 120 million for this movie, I am disappointed with the 2nd half of the movie."
5,Under Appreciated Movie!,"After hearing the so/so reviews for this movie, I was pleasantly surprised after watching it what a great movie it was. Truly one of the few that I can watch over again and not get bored with it."
3,Let's Vacation to The Island,"I'll start of by pointing out the obvious problem of this movie. They are advertising the twist! If you didn't know ""The Island"" wasn't real, this movie would have such a more powerful impact. Now the other problem isn't really bad, the movie works well, but it feels like two different pictures. I enjoyed the first half of this fim, very very much. It's mysterious, enthrawling and the dialogue is satisfying. Then, in the second half of the film, it turns a completley around and turns into a firy action film. The action is very good, but going from a complex scifi morality issue to minor car chases and exploding buildings leaves a person scratching their heads. Acting is of course marvelous, Scarlett and Ewan are brilliant in their crafts. I just wish the entire product was more like the first half of the film, but all in all a visit to this island is definately recommended."
2,Deserted Island,"Michael Bay's ""The Island"" was the whipping boy for the disastrous summer movie season that was 2005. Filled with lots of action and talented actors in the form of Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johannsen the filmed promised to be a huge event film but winded up being a box office bomb. The reason easily is the story.Others have elaborated on the story here so I need not give another summary. What I did feel while watching this film was that whoever wrote the script borrowed heavily from ""logan's Run"" and 80's thriller ""Coma"" with just a dash of Lucas'""THX"" to create a convoluted, heavy-handed, cheesy hollywood mess about the dangers of cloning and the individual.The actors gave it their best to save this film and Michael Bay blew up everything to get the male audience in the seats. In the end though ""The Island"" deserved to be the summer's movie whipping boy because it exemplifies why people didnt go that much this summer- we've seen the story (done better) before."
3,THIS WAS A BOOK!!!!,"I HAVE READ THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF BOOKS IN MY LIFE, AND I KNOW THAT I HAVE READ THIS EXACT STORY LINE AS A BOOK. I CAN'T REMEMBER WHO WROTE IT OR THE TITLE, BUT I KNOW I READ A BOOK ABOUT A HIDDEN INSTALLMENT OF CLONES, PROMISED A LIFE ON A MYTHICAL ISLAND, WHO WERE ACTUALLY CLONES HARVESTED FOR ORGANS! I WILL BE SEARCHING FOR THIS BOOK, AND AS SOON AS I HAVE A TITLE AND AUTHOR, I WILL POST IT HERE! JUST THOUGHT PEOPLE MIGHT WANT TO KNOW THAT THIS WAS A COMPLETE PLAGIARISM!"
2,"LIKED THE MOVIE,BUT NOT THE DVD RELEASE!!!","2 stars is for DVD,NOT the movie!I love Michael bay Movies and he comes to action he ROCKS...I liked this movie MUCH; MUCH better an that stupid ""STEATH"". Was almost came out after each other in theaters and that was stupid too,I think thats why none of them made any money in box office!. I was really looking to buy this DVD for my collection when comes out. But this is not Michael bay DVD release!.. His poplar of double disks or extended cut movies and loaded DVDS..Definitely not this DVD version!!. I KNOW for sure like the rest of them, he going to come out with another version this DVD with extras and extended cuts and loaded stuffs with DTS audio, in near soon. If u look at hes PASS DVD releases u would know ...SO if u DVD collector like I am , just wait and get the real thing later on. Just skip this one ,just rent it if u want to real see it! Great action pack..Liked it a lot! A"
2,bd,this movie dos not make sence at all but this film isnt even trying to act like a action movie its suppost to act like a comedy
4,WOW 2019,"Could this possibley be the future, is cloning that far away. Weird thing is that the possibility of this happening in the future becomes more and more an more of a reality. I am not a big sci-fi fan but i actually sat through the whole two hours and fifiteen mintutes. The action seen and special effects are incrediable. Good Work Michael Bay......"
3,"Not Perfect, But A Lot to Like","For half its length, this is an inventive and ultra-stylish futuristic thriller. It has a vaguely ""Soylent Green"" quality, and it reveals its surprise very nicely about halfway through. Once our heroes escape, however, it becomes a fairly ordinary chase movie, with some ludicrously unbelievable escapes and a thinly veiled anti-genetic-engineering agenda. Nonetheless, there's a lot of effective detail, and McGregor and Johansson convincingly portray characters who are a combination of implanted knowledge and real-world naveté. For director Michael Bay (""Bad Boys"" I and II, ""Armageddon""), this was a step up. U.S. audiences stayed away in droves, and international audiences didn't exactly flock to it, either, but it deserved a bit more attention than it got."
4,Excellent action and storydevelopment,"The movie is supposed to be set sometime, somewhere in the near future and the production was ""almost"" successful in creating that impression. I felt the ""futuristic"" flavor started to become bland towards the middle when the action was just picking up. I was hoping that with the future being more developed and all, they would come out with more sophisticated or at least ""advance"" weaponries, but,...I guess that's one aspect that fell through the cracks. 4 stars for the good action and nice storyline."
4,Good Sci-Fi Fun,"This is a good science fiction movie. Well-done action and special effects. Certainly a decent storyline which, while some may find it a tad predictable, is still engaging enough to be enjoyable. I didn't detect any points of obvious weakness; it just lacks that special ""5 star"" something."
2,Another video game without soul,"What a waste. Just because you add F/X to story that's been done before, doesn't make mediocre good."
4,nice two hours,"It is literally the philosophic problem of the ""brains in the vat""The answer posed by the movie is that humanity or human consciousness is curiosity, love, goals, and the striving to be human. The curiosity of one man is portrayed like a meme leaping from one susceptible mind to the next.i liked the movie. enough action and mystery to stay involved and enough human interest to keep my wife awake. the only down side was the ""deus ex machina"" action of making him in contact with his original and learning his memories without any plausible explanation even attempted.i'n surprised that the movie isn't doing better. worth while seeing."
3,GOOD LOOKING -- GREAT ACTION (BUT NOT ORIGINAL),"If you passed on THE ISLAND (DreamWorks) because of the misleading title, strange trailers and obtuse poster, some bad reviews, well, you missed a great-looking, high-energy thriller that's essentially an uncredited remake of 1979's CLONUS (Mondo Macabre).Set in a near and believable future, it's about the ultimate insurance policy wedded with cutting edge science.To say more would be unfair. For a surprisingly satisfying, edge of your seat experience about identity and mortality check out this overlooked flick."
2,Fake Sci-fi,"The Island is an ordinary action movie that pretends to be more.Although the plot and the cast look very interesting we do not see McGregor and Johansen do a lot but running through corridors. Was it really necessary to have this talented coupleplay these kind of everyday characters? The answer is of course yes, because otherwise the Island would have been a waste of time.(SARR)"
4,Good movie w/ good storyline,"I just purchased the DVD, and the movie was very enjoyable. The storyline is great. The acting was good... rated PG-13, and the clothes Scarlett Johannson wore in that movie were ""appropriate"", no foul language, though some scenes are filled with action (guns and police chases).This movie has enough action and a good plot to keep your eyes on the screen, and a few funny moments too. It was worth my $15.I recommend it! :)"
2,One island that is not a viewers paradise,"Think of a blend between LOGANS RUN and THE SIXTH DAY... but not as good.About 70 minutes into this movie my wife and I looked at each other and said.. ""Had enough yet ?""The eject button was our next move.Even without watching the whole film it just seemed like one of those ""clones learn their true identity and develop their own individual will to live and try to break free to release their fellow clones""..yadda...yadda...yadda....I SHOULD have liked this film, I'm a sci-fi buff and have even liked Bay's other work...... but this one just FELT like one of those bad 1970s sci-fi flicks like Soylent Green or Omega Man (a weak remake of the classic Vincent Price film)I did not check the box office results for this film, but I think it came and went pretty much un-noticed too"
3,Hollywood must be desprate.,This film had better be good! becouse it looks from the prevews tobe a remake of the 1973/1975 classic LOGAN'S RUN Only they have renamed it. everything else is the same. Youed better be good! Cuse the original is a classic!!!!!!thanks.
1,Who greenlighted this project?,"Holy schlamoly, this film stinks. How on earth Michael Bay managed to harness such star power for this schlock is beyond me. If there were any justice in this world (there's not), his pyrotechnics crew would receive a bigger billing than McGregor, Johansson, and Buscemi.Plot synopsis: things explode, a handheld camera jerks about, McGregor or Johansson shout ""Go!"", ""Run!"", or ""No!"", and then the token black dude turns out not to be evil at all.I imagine that Michael Bay often has lunch with Brett Rattner to discuss the nuances of explosions and how a beautifully choreographed car chase lends itself to storytelling. Shudder. I would spend good money to send these guys to The Island."
2,well-produced sci-fi for Christian-right movie goers,"This is a well-produced, well-acted sci-fi movie with a strong anti-abortion scenes in it. Personally, i think they should keep religion out of sci-fi movies, but the director certainly has his agenda in the film. To a degree the movie is inspired by the far-superior (and non-religious) sci-fi film Gattaca. I will give The Island credit for one thing though, it has an absolutely great chase scene in the movie (the one with the flying motorcycles)."
2,nothing new,People inside cocoons - you saw it in The Matrix.People on tables unaware of themselves - you saw it in Coma.Cities with transports overhead - you saw it in Blade Runner and The 5th Element.Cars fliping on a car chase on a highway - Matrix once again.And so on.As I said... nothing new.
3,inside mailbox light,"This mailbox light is a piece of junk. I have had 3 of them in 12 months and they all have the same problem - bulb burns out and it is not replaceaable. If it wasn't for the buld the light would probabnly be ok. I have given up going back to the retailer with ""my story"" as he always tels me ""no one else has ever had this problem""! Good luckCWM"
1,Whoa! This calendar stinks!,"My kids got it for me for Xmas and it doesn't even come close to being funny. Every other page is bart at the blackboard writing things like ""I will not encourage others to fly."" And the rest of the pages have images on what appears to be video game units (you know, like at the arcade in the mall). I just don't get it. The only thing worse would be a Rosey O' calendar!"
2,"Disappointing, compared to last year's Quotable Homer","Although there a some good laughs in here, the Quotable Bart doesn't come close to the Quotable Homer from last year. The makers of this calendar left out the Simpson's episode sources for the pictures and quotes, which is something I enjoyed checking out with last year's calendar. Quotable Bart also relies too much on the stuff Bart writes on the blackboard. Perhaps they should stick with the 12 month calendar from now on."
1,New Christian Music!!! = HORRIBLE!!!,"When I first heard this, I could'nt believe my friggin ears!What is this guy doing??...sounds like side project music!Ladytron did a way better job than Stephan did experimenting with guitars. Yes , I know he had guitars before but not infront of the music like this CD, sounds like Christian Music. I'm sure he lost alot of fans because of this, but I'm gonna wait til the next one to see what happens on this 'musical adventure' he's going on. I've seen this cd for twenty dollars or more elsewhere and I laugh because I know someone will but it and be disappointed. If you like the way it sounds you're better off buying it used here! You won't here these songs @ the Club that's for sure. 1 Star for the artwork!"
1,I hate it!,"I simply can't believe how far Stephen Groth has gone into the mainstream. I guess he's always been heading in that direction, but the qaulity of his music has changed drasticly with this album. I had heard that this was ganna be bad, but I didn't think it would be a One Star kind of bad!!! Woa!! It's total Top 40 pop slop meets emo or Indie poser or some kind of lame attempt at selling out. If he stays on this path I'm ganna have to stop supporting him...this album truly bites!"
3,Is VNV Nation the only one in the genre to keep it real?,"3 recent releases by the big 3 in whatever you call this type of music.. EBM? Industrial Trance?Matter and Form VNV Nation- Incredible. A masterpiece.Skyshaper-Covenant- Horrible. 3rd rate techno.This Album by Apop.... WTF??? Okay, I admit they put out an OK pop album with this one, but how can you turn your back on your bread and butter, and your fans, and your creativity like that? Do they think they are like Moby and can try to put out a rock album to give their electronic stuff more credibility? I don't get it. I love Apop.... the old Apop. Putting out stuff like this, they should change their name to Pop Absurd."
1,A-Poop-Tygma has gone Berzerk!,"This is the worst album ever made! This is sooooooooo far from the verry good Apoptygma Berzerk album ""Welcome To Earth""...that you could literraly compare them night and day. This is a sunny, radio pop, emo-eske, sell out record that is more likely to capture fans of Britney Spears than appeal to fans of industrial music. Don't bother with this album."
3,Evolution NOT Revolution,"Apop has always been a band in evolution and this album is no exception, although, I find myself much more of a fan of ""Welcome to Earth,"" than I did this foray into more of an 80's style rock-synth fusion. ""Cambodia"" is an interesting cover of an old Kim Wilde song and I do have to say that I really like the treatment that Apop gave it. You need to think of ""You and Me Against the World,"" as more of an evolutionary experiment more so than you need to think of it as the future of Apop necessarily. I will continue to buy their work and hope that maybe they get the guitar balance right on the second go."
5,You and Me Against the World,"Fits in perfectly, chronologically, with the rest of Apop's work. Love it, and very relateable, plenty of light, dark, then dancier tracks."
4,re-recorded hits and a few new songs.,"This one is re-recorded hits from the band in 1988. So you get in reality a whole new disc and not the older versions of the hits. The new songs are good but not great but that is just a bonus for buyers. ""lets put the x in sex' is a silly song but that's ok too. the video of it was funny too!Do I like the new versions of the old hits better than the older ones? NO, but they are still good versions. In fact , only 1982's 'killers' had real versions of the older songs on it , plus 4 new ones too. There wouldn't be a greatest hits disc with the older songs until 1996 or so.So if you like melodic rock and want some classic kiss redone by the 1980's version of kiss then you could do alot worse than this."
2,Its Okay KISS Great Band But...,This cd is okay all the songs are good and all but there remixes...first off let me say im a huge KISS fan i have like 15 of there cds anyways this one i do not own but i know that these are all just remixes and dont sound the same or as good rock n roll all night on here isnt even them its jsut remixed completlycheap complimation go for KISS Gold 1974-1982 for the same price as this CD with the orignal versions of the songs and like way more great songs just get the two new songs of itunes please instead of buying the cd for 14 bucks or get KISS gold or the very best of instead of thisHUGE KISS FAN
3,"Good, but Incomplete...","I like the remixes; and the new songs ""Let's Put the X in Sex"" and ""Rock Hard"" are a bit poppy and 80's style, but I like them, I think they're fun, catchy songs that rock out. ""X in Sex"" was big on MTV. I loved Eric Carr, but why they had him re-do ""Beth"" as if Peter Criss was dead...I'll never figure out. The tracklist is incomplete! Where the heck are ""Crazy Nights"" and ""Reason to Live"" which were big hits for them just one year prior to this release?? Also, ""Uh! All Night"", ""Fits Like a Glove"" ""War Machine"" ""All Hell's Breakin Loose"" ????? I mean where are the OTHER KEY songs that came out since the last compilation at this point since Double Platinum???"
3,Interesting,This album includes some of Kiss' best songs and is a cool compilation.But the 2 new songs Rock Hard and X in Sex are 2 throwaways this thing could have done without.
4,"Docked one star for re-recording ""Beth""","As the many KISS reissues are concerned, this one probably is the most consistent. ""Greatest Kiss"" does a fair job as well, but puts a few of the lamer album cuts in (""Flaming Youth"" over this disc's ""Lick It Up,"" for example.) But why oh why did they have to substitute a re-recorded vocal on ""Beth""?Either way, I own both discs becuase of the ommisions from each, and so far have avoided the 2002 Greatest Hits package becuase I already have anything from it that I'd already want. The bonus here is getting the riotus ""Let's Put The X in Sex,"" with a (...) Paul Stanley vocal. Other than that, well, you've got most of these already."
4,"Kiss Collection Before ""Crazy Night""","I haven't had the opportunity to see them live. But I watched the TV live show of Kiss a couple of years ago. This compilationonly of my Kiss album so far had been of much help because the show included almost the same songs this one had.This compilation with two newer tracks in 1989 well sums up Kiss's glorious days before Crazy Nights. I really like two of additional tracks that surely live up to what Kiss is all about. A little bit of complaint is Beth with Eric Carr vocal that is not only placed incorrectly(maybe between ROCK'N ROLL ALL NIGHT and SHOUT IT OUT LOUD might have worked better) but is not done excellently though I do not know the original. And a couple of live tracks would have mede this compilation a timeless classic.(My opinion: ""Detroit Rock City"" should have been live).Recommended for 80's rock fans."
3,Overmixed KISS but a good overview of hits,"Greatest KISS or Double Platinum would both be better choices that Smashes but it's still KISS so you can't go wrong. Eric Carr sings Beth on this one which was pretty much in line with the bad blood between Peter Criss and Gene and Paul. It shows a lot of disrespect, in my opinion, to replace Peter on this song especially since it was KISS' biggest hit."
2,"Good song choices, but.....","I'm not really thrilled with the remastered versions. I don't like the drums on Shout It Out Loud or on Rock & Roll All Nite. The 2 new songs are great, but I believe it was blasphemous for them to re-do Beth with Eric Carr on vocals. Good song choice like I said (maybe 1 or 2 other older ones), but this would be the 2nd (Double Platinum-1st) of 50 greatest hits compilations."
2,Kiss off,"A lot of us used to be Kiss fans, even me once, but it's time for them to go away now. If you really want Kiss, then Smashes, Thrashes is all you need to get since it contains all of their good songs (Both of them). This album has a half a dozen songs or so that I can stand and a bunch more songs that have been more overplayed than a twenty year old VCR. This is a collection for all those old stubborn yuppies who refuse to acknowledge newer or more progressive rock. By the way, I hate that song 'Beth'. BOOOOOORING. Was that a song for a baby record? If rock stars want to have a bad boy image then their music needs to match."
3,Good intro to the band,"If you don't own ANY Kiss recordings, this isn't a bad place to start. Why not 5 stars? I don't like the remixed versions of the songs, and the two 'new' tracks were easily forgotten. Regardless, Eric Carr's version of Beth is a nice change of pace and it contains an excellent mix of songs."
3,Compilation,This is a KISS compilation covering their career into the later 80s period. There are two new studio tracks and Eric Carr sings Beth.
5,ABSOLUTELY KILLER,It will earn a permanent place in your disc player. In the past few years I've given away dozens of copies of this disc to deadhead and non-deadhead friends alike. You won't be sorry.
3,Couple of Gems from late 1980's,"This is almost exclusively recordings from the later 1980's. Dylan covers--especially the ballads, tended to be slow and lacked exciting jams when the Dead played them. There are some gems like She Belongs to Me. But Jerry's voice could be painful in a bad way in his final years--and Bobby could get too energetic and reach past his ability vocally on these songs. Dylan vehicles were VERY basic songs instrumentally and dont provide much interest for the mature lover of instrumental music (eg jazz) and the Dead's legend jams. Personally I could have settled for the versions on my many other Dead releases...hence this will get little playing time. I have not yet heard it, but I wish I had bought the Jerry does Dylan CD instead!"
2,size,they need to list product size on the page so you can measure your bike and get the right size. listing the size of the box is useless.
4,Sony engineering,"The screen has to be at the correct angle to maximize theview but it is an amazing little TV. I've had mine for about 2 years, It's dependable."
2,Only UHF comes in...very disappointed,Only the Spanish stations come in. I switched the button to VHF but nothing comes in. Am I missing something?
5,Sequel expands warfare into intricate conspiracy plot.,"A woman with a mysterious past on the run, a Christian School and Ministry under demonic attack, a young girl apparently possessed. How does it all come together? Frank Peretti's nightmarish conspiracy thriller will undoubtedly keep you on the edge of your seat until you find out. Worthwhile and recommended."
5,A stellar read,"I was first given the name of Frank E Peretti by a coworker as an excellent Christian author. I didn't realize at the time that the current book I was reading (and unable to put down) was also by this author.Piercing the darkness is a book that is extremely difficult to describe. It must be read. It is an understandable, albeit fictional, battle between the unseen spiritual turmoils faced daily.This book, and all others by Frank E Peretti are must reads!!!!!Everyone I know who has read one, must read them all. As have I.You won't be dissapointed."
5,Yet another page turner,"Okay, after reading This Present Darkness, I didn't think it could get any better...but it did. Again, if you like a good story - read this book!"
1,"Fast moving paper thin characters, worse than TV","Frank Peretti tries to emphasize the importance of prayer in thechristian experience by weaving a fast moving tale of satanic conspiracy.A noble motive. A terrible novel.Characters are either good or bad. All good characters are saintlike. Allbad characters are demon possessed. You can find more plausiblecharacters on television. To make up for such thin characters the plot moves very quickly. So quickly that many people miss thepoint that the novel departs bible based theology.Great book if you cannotfind it in yourself to criticize anything labeled ""christian"", an experience similarto having a tooth filled for those more discerning.Read ""Cry, the Beloved Country"" instead."
2,Abridged version!!!,"I searched everywhere on the description of this to determine if it was abridged or not and did not see this info. Upon getting the CD's, it is in small print on the label that it is abridged. I returned them without problem to Amazon."
4,A great captivating masterpiece,"Frank Peretti has done it again! This kind of writing is why he is my favorite author. I've never read the first book, but I have read most of the ""Cooper Kids Adventure"" series. I loved the suspense and the mystery in the plot. I think he kind of stretched the ending a little bit, but I still liked it. I look forward to reading the first book now that I know this isn't it, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good book."
5,Prayer is soo powerful!!,"In these books Frank Peretti shows the importance of prayer, and sometimes in this day and age we forget it. God can use our prayers in ways we can't even imagine. In this book Tal can't opperate without the prayers of the saints ,and it's no different in real life."
5,An Excellent reminder of how important our Christianity is!!,"I loved this book, especially since it followed and included characters from This Present Darkeness. It truly inspired me to be the best Christian I can be - and to remember that God is with us always. It makes you realize that there are real evil spirits at work, and that we all must pray and have faith in Jesus, and our holy warriors - to do battle against evil. Keep writing Mr. Peretti!"
3,I expected more,"While the book maintained a steady pace, the theology introduced by Mr Peretti was somewhat faulted. I felt that the book seemed to point out that human freedom and choice were secondary, almost irrelavant, to the ""spiritual battles&quot"
5,Morality dilema? Problem resolution at it's finest !!,"The best of the series from Mr. Perretti. An effective means of ministry. Far too often we speak ""Christianese"" to none beleivers, alienating them and reducing the value of our testimony. This murder/mystery format reaches out to everyone, while at the same time asking and answering questions that challenge the reader to delve into themselves and make some decisions. Decisions that will alter their lives for an eternity. This is evangelism at it's finest. Meet the people where they are. Capture their interest, and hit them with some truths that will shake their foundation. Mature beleivers will draw courage from, and get a greater understanding of some spiritual aspects defined in this book. Very well done"
1,Worst Read,"I tried and tried to read this book, but it was confusing, too many characters, very slow start and just plain not worth a person's time and effort. This book was chosen by my book club, otherwise, I would never have given it so many chances before finally tossing it down."
4,This book was awesome!!,"In his second book, Piercing the Darkness, Frank Peretti hits a proverbial home run. He easily exceeds his first work, This Present Darkness, which was great in itself. The characters are developed more fully than they were in This Present Darkness and the plot reads like many of today's headlines. Rarely does a sequel exceed the original. But, Piercing The Darkness does just that. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is either concerned with the spiritual battles going on in the world today or who is looking for a suspense ride like few books deliver."
4,great second reunion tour 1987,"Deep Purple always made a magic performances, this second reunion tour was great, my humble opinion. The set were recorded in Calif irvine meadows, Arizona, Oslo and Verona Italy. The opening set Highway star is incredible, the second song Strange kind of woman with the Jesus christ superstar as a hard rock improvisation. I enjoy it so much! The new version of Hush is also cool, I enjoyed the old version too, but the new one is still the best and much much more powerfull. Ian Gillan tried to sing Child in time one more time, the song he did not perform, since his departure in 1973. But the result is brain melting. I don't understand any reviews below, some fans said that the album is bad. If you like Made in japan & live at the olympia albums, certainly you will love this one too, because the songs are similar, though some songs have changed through Blackmore co improvisations. You got it folks?"
3,Overrated; 'Made in Japan' is by far their best live album!,"This is a good live album, but it doesn't have enough energy. Buy 'Made in Japan' instead which I think is their best album."
5,Great buy!,Bought as a gift to my father. He loves the cd/band and enjoyed it very much. Packaging was great and it was delivered on time. I'm happy with my purchase..so no complaints from me!
4,only silly people who saying deep purple is a bad one,"the fans below dont understand the band so much, if you love Made in Japan, you must also like this cd. I love this cd very much. This cd is a second great reunion tour after the absence of pink (Knebworth fair 1985). The songs are great include from their spectacular albums like In rock, Machine head, house of the blue light, Perfect strangers."
2,Not that great...,"This could have been a great album. Unfortunally it's recorded at several different venues which causes a loss of ""live feeling"". Furthermore it's edited. Deep Purple shouldn't be experienced edited. Buy one of the raw live albums with lot's of energy instead!"
1,Disappointing live versions of classic studio cuts,"Any time a group attempts a live album there is the risk that the music, rather than become more powerful, will lose vitality in the live translation. Such is the case here. Deep Purple has a number of live collections that work well - Made in Japan for example. This is not one of them. These live versions come across as uninspired and, in some cases, downright lazy. Unless you are one who desires ""everything"" put on CD by Deep Purple, spend your money more selectively among their other offerings."
2,THEY HAVE MUCH BETTER LIVE ALBUMS,"This album certainly does not reveal all the magic and power that a DP's live recording offers.This happens mainly because at that time there was a lot of friction between the members of the band, especially between Gillan and Blackmore.The band seems somewhat restrained and the setlist,apart from the 80's songs,is the same old stuff;they had to wait till 1995,when Morse came in the band, to try again some forgotten but wonderful tunes as Bloodsucker or When A Blindman Cries.If you want to listen to some of their after reunion lives I would recommend Come Hell Or High Water or LATO 96,supposing of course you own Made in Japan."
2,Don't get this one,"On my 2-CD redigitized version the sound is quite good. All the best stuff is here. However, there are more wasted bytes on between-track banter. That's not the worst thing about the album though. One would expect such an excellent rock classic as ""My Woman...."" to receive its full due, but it doesn't. Somewhere after a few bars, the song is abandoned for a senseless lonesome take-off on Buddy Holly. Go figure. Deep Purple has much better stuff out than this."
2,Good selection of songs -- still not much good though,"I like Deep Purple and the majority of the songs covered on this album but I did not care for this album for some reason. Perhaps the mastering was a problem? My version came on a single CD rather than two. As far as I can tell, my version is not the ""digitally re-mastered"" version here, so perhaps perhaps that makes a difference. [Also check reviews of the other versions of this titles -- they are rated much lower]. The banter on the album is quite entertaining and takes me back to the now innocent-seeming 70's! Overall though, disappointing and I do not play this often -- try one of their other albums (e.g. 24 carat Purple)."
2,?,"Is it just me? Or does everybody else notice it to? MADE IN JAPAN is so great! But everything live Purple has puts out afterwards,Blackmore sounds like he just hates to be there!"
2,Excellent selection of songs -- still not much good though,"I like Deep Purple and the majority of the songs covered on this album (most of the greats are on this album) but I did not care for it for some reason. Perhaps the mastering was the problem, or perhaps being a live album the sound quality just was not there to start with? My version came on a single CD rather than two. As far as I can tell, my version is not the ""digitally re-mastered"" version here, so perhaps perhaps that makes a significant difference. [Also check reviews of the other versions of this title -- they are rated much lower than this version]. The banter on the album is quite entertaining and takes me back to the now innocent-seeming 70's!"
3,For Completists Only,"Bobby Taylor's limited success at Motown is not due to a lack of a good voice, but more of a lack of good material. ""Does Your Mama Know About Me"" and ""Malinda"" are two of my all-time favorite Motown tracks so I enthusiastically bought this collection. I was disappointed and can understand why none of this other releases hit. Nothing on this collection comes close to the two hits he's known for. Most of the material is just ""ok!"" Nothing that you can ask, ""why wasn't this a hit?"" I wouldn't recommend this collection unless you are a Motown collector. Otherwise, download Bobby's best two tracks ""Does Your Mama Know About Me"" and ""Malinda"" and enjoy!"
2,Somewhat Disappointed,It was good hearing the songs and bringing back memories but the conversion to CD was very poor quality. Some parts sound like someone was playing 45's in the garage or basement and copied it on a CD.
5,Stunning!,"In the present day it is refreshing to hear such a pure voice intertwined so beautifully with words that could paint her world. Emme has taken a step ahead, and what a big step it is!!"
1,The Worst CD I have Ever Heard,"Despite her pretty voice, Emme Packer's CD lacks strong lyrics and instrumentals. Every song sounds the same - same acoustic guitar sound on every track. And only her voice is heard, no others- redundant and boring. It sounds as though someone right out of 8th grade grade wrote the lyrics and composed the songs. BIG waste of bucks on this one."
4,these are the days,van gets better with age it's too bad people know rod stewart's version of have i told you van wrote the damn song people give him his due these are the days when people wake up and listen to the most soulful man there ever was
4,Avalon Street,"Heard his music on movies and glad I finaly tracked it down, This guy is a great song writer and good singer. Very moving music"
2,Not nearly as good as earlier work,"This album has received tremendous praise from many of the Amazon customers but I have to disagree. The lyrics are not nearly as deep and personal as those found on Moondance and Astral Weeks. His voice has obviously aged as well. When examined critically, Van Morrison's voice is not why we enjoy his music (at least for me anyway). It is the spirit and the feelings that his music engenders. His voice is just good enough to not take away from these things. He is in the same league as a Stevie Ray Vaughn, Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin in that regard. These guys would probably not sell many acapella albums but would win poetry contests or instrumental competitions for days. When Van Morrison's aged voice is coupled with lyrics written to say ""I am a Christian"" and not ""I am Van Morrison (who happens to be a Christian)"" you get only 2 - 2.5 stars."
4,a lovely album,"I have never really heard a lot of Van Morrison music, but bought this album to use ""these are the days"" in a college play I directed. Since then, I have kept the CD in the car and play it when I need to think some things out. It is a lovely peaceful album, which seems to cry out for a listen at dusk while driving in the country. My copy finally wore out, so I will have to buy a new one. I can't wait"
5,This one will make you smile!,"This is such a fun DVD! I was smiling the whole time I was working out! I love that you can choose a short workout or a long one! I can hardly wait to put it back in the DVD player! Come on girls! Let's shimmy! Oh, it says it is for beginners, but even if you aren't a beginner, this one is fun, so if you need something fun to pop in just to get you moving, get this!"
2,DEFINATLY NOT FOR BEGINNERS!,I have been doing belly dancing for aprox a year and also doing several tapes I was so disappointed in this videa as it is NOT for beginners. the prompts and the skills are not at all for beginners all i can say is money wasted and frustration is all i got from this video
5,Awesome!,"Wow, this video is awesome. If you want to firm your tummy, butt and thighs this is the video for you. I want to lose weight as well and I know this awesome video will help me. Easy to do and music is amazing. Thank you."
5,Amazing!!!,"Even if you are not a belly dance person and I'm not; you will love this dvd. The music is great. The moves are fantastic and you will sweat up a storm. Seir did a wonderful job detailing the contents of the dvd, so I won't do that. But I will tell you that I enjoyed it thoroughly. If you don't have any belly dance experience, it may take a while to make your hips move in the right direction. However, practice makes perfect! Great job ladies!"
4,USEFUL,THIS SHOWER HEAD IS VERY USEFUL AND DOES A GOOD JOB DELIVERING WATER. THE ON/OFF SWITCH NEED A BETTER WASHER TO STOP LEAKS WHEN TURNED OFF.
3,Inspiracional,"Un buen libro que da la pauta para iniciar un proceso de transformaci?n social en las organizaciones. Esta escrito como historia lo que facilita su lectura. Es completamente motivacional. A su vez, es un libro en donde el autor promociona sus servicios en base a su metodolog?a.Recomiendo tomarlo de forma inspiracional y si uno no esta de acuerdo en el m?todo o proceso del autor, por lo menos si puede servir de guia."
2,are we there yet,"i have the hardcover from 1915. i found the book to drag, endlessly. it was rather depressing to hear about the conditions which the dock workers had to work as well as the stokers in the bottoms of the steam ships. while their working conditions were all true it cast a gloomy and murky shadow over the story. you need to be in the mood for a grity political novel to read this."
5,Inspiring and Inspired!,"This album is a celebration of life. Of a woman's life, a Jew's life, a mother's life, a human being's life. The songs cover abuse, death, longing, joy, growth, marriage, motherhood and celebration. These five excellent musicians make the transition from bat mitzvah to miscarriage, messianic longing to borscht beautifully and seemlessly. The contrast of voices, vocal harmonies, supberb accordian, violin, bass and clarinet playing would alone be enough to make this a great album--but the feeling, the carefully chosen texts and melodies give it that extra push towards perfection. So give it a listen and hear Mikveh's honest and beautiful tribute to a Jewish woman's life. Even if you aren't a Jew or a woman you'll be moved to tears and inspired to bounce around your livingroom. Perfect!"
5,Your chance to see excellence,"The music industry is diluted with many bands that have no emotion. David Gray, however, is not one of these. He has so much passion for what he does, as a listener, you can almost feel his emotion. The DVD ""Live at the point"" is a great compliment to his music. You can see the feelng that he puts behind each individual song allowing you, the viewer to experience the concert that was out on In Dublin. This DVD is exciting. If you are a David Gray fan, this is a must buy."
5,I Babble On Because I love David Gray and his music!,I love this DVD. I love David Gray. I love his music. I love his band. I love this DVD. I love David Gray. I love his music. I love his band. I love this DVD...
3,July Barbie,Ordered the July Barbie for a 4 year old. She wasn't impressed. A little too sophisticated for her. She was more interested in the dog.
4,Good in depth read on Rupert Murdoch,"Very interesting read. This biography goes into a lot of detail about Murdoch's first few decades in business - 50's to the end of the 80's.Very interesting insights into the man who created the most powerful media company in the world. This biography stands out compared to the others I have read, as the author has talked personally to a lot of people who dealt with Murdoch over the years.Jerome also has the benefit of writing this after having had a personal interview with Murdoch.The only downside is it was written at the end of the 80's, so it doesn't get to cover some of the most exciting times in the life of Murdoch.I'd thoroughly recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in Rupert Murdoch, or The News Corporation."
3,Worth it,"Like the characters in the novel, I think Stephanie Laurens' style has matured some in this book. Penny and Charles seemed realistic to me, as did their responses to each other and how they eventually decide to let themselves love each other. Since they know each other well, they have a deeper relationship than one that seems to be just passonate but almost casual sex. Reminded me of the long term friendship in A Secret Love, which is probably my favorite SL book.All that said, the spy sub-plot is over done, doesn't make sense and drags on way too long. I felt the book ended up being 50-100 pages longer than the story warranted due to the silly spy story. This applies to the other Bastion Club books, too, which don't have the compelling but simple story of her earlier work.If you love SL books, it is worth buying this one. Not her best, but the passion is there and the characters realistic and believable."
2,Disappointing,"Started with a zip, and just zapped out. Got over half way... and it just started dragging. Once the sex started, the pages just started filling up with mostly sex..Fluff fluff and more fluff...... I didn't think I had a modesty level, (what one reviewer noted) but I guess when it comes down to it...I just might have one after all, wanting more a story and less steamy sex or fluff.....I love Stephanie Laurens, but the Bastion series, has been my least favorite so far. This is the third in the series...and it was not worth keeping for me. On a romance meter....it was very low.However, on a different note....if you are looking for a book that makes you hunger for sex...this is it!!! The heroine shatters and screams many times. I got to page 324... And those words I was so sick of seeing...I finally screamed and shattered the book.Sorry Ms Laurens, I still love you though... and hopefully the future is not so shattering."
4,"Strong on Romance, Not so Strong on Plot","It's still a good book for the romance. I enjoyed the innuendos in their conversations -- clever and fun to read. Penny was more an equal to Charles than Laurens usually writes. The mystery ran along a little slowly, but it all came together at an exciting end. I was never bored and was a little surprised at the negative reviews here. I hope she does a book about Dalziel."
1,What is Happening???,"I have been noticing an increasing, dismaying trend in all of my favorite writers: they aren't using intimacy between the characters as the emotional connection it should be, but as a space filler when they have nothing else to write about!And Stephanie Laurens has done this in a few of her latest books.Putting all my doubts aside, I reluctantly bought this book and had to struggle my way through it. I honestly couldn't wait for Charles's story, I thought it would be my favorite. But Ms. Laurens didn't even try to make these characters remotely likable, to me. I had a hard time empathizing with them and their love. I am so sick of romance novelists thinking that if they add enough blatant sexuality it makes a good novel! What happened to the ROMANCE??? It really is despairing."
2,Too long,"I found this latest title in the Bastion Club series way too long. It was full of longeurs and gratuitous sex. If some of that had been cut the book would have been several hundred words shorter and the font size could have been enlarged, thus making it physically much easier too read!!"
2,Too Wordy and Lacked Movement,"This was not a typical Laurens book, she used a too many words to get across one idea. The hero was not as dashing and delicious as in other books. To me it felt like she was not up to it or didn't want to write this book and just put words together to produce a novel. It's as if she was pressured into writing this one. I starting reading historical romance novels reading Stephanie Lauren books, she is the standard I use (along with Lisa Kleypas) to select a novel; they are so-o-o romantic, with men you could fall in love with, but not this book. After waiting so long for it, I was thoroughly let down."
2,Blah,I give this book two stars only because I hesitate to give any book one star unless it ignites a fiery passion of hatred in me. This book was so boring it failed to ignite absolutely anything. The premise seemed pointless - they spend most of their time chasing after information about her step-brother who was a smuggler when he was already dead anyway. Because it might damage her reputation. Thrilling.. not.Anything interesting or exciting got lost in the details. I got so bored I gave up.
3,"Not exactly boring, but!!!","While I basically enjoyed the book, I did find it tedious at times. The love scenes were long and boring and a few too many. I did enjoy the subplot of secret selling to the French. And I enjoy the members of the Bastion Club and am eagerly awaiting Dalziel's story.I hope Ms. Laurens will read some of the reviews--many are saying the same. All her books could be about fifty pages less and not lose anything--just perhaps gain a few more loyal readers."
2,Boring Boring Sex,"This book is very thin on plot and the sex is excruciatingly boring. The book goes like this- Engaging characters meet, discuss intrigue, begin an affair, have page after page of boring boring sex, discuss intrigue, more pages of boring sex, a page of discussing intrigue, zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz."
2,BOOOOOOORRRRRRIIIIIINNNNNGGGG.,"Short but sweet - the Bastion Club series are nothing but pages and pages and pages and pages of sex, with very little story. Not worth your time."
2,Third Strike,"I'm only on page 57 and already confused. Chas jumps right in and asks about ""a priest hole"" without any previous buildup. I felt I had missed a couple pages. Having only read the 2 previous books in this series by S. Laurens who is new to me I can already see there is very little variation to the books. The guys are all the most strongest, best looking, richest, hard to resist, stubborn, domineering men possible. Plus they always get what they want. Don't know how much of this line of writing I can take."
1,So many typographical errors,"I bought this book and I was so interested in it. Once I started comparing it to a copy I had online I saw so many typographical errors (fifty instead of fifteen, palce instead of place) in the first few pages. I do recommend this book but by another publisher."
1,Useless Version of a Good Book,"I bought this book for a history class, but this book turned out to be useless that I have to buy a new version! -- it's countless typos, obsolete, nay archaic English usages have driven me crazy.Additionally, I cannot even find the publisher and translator's info, which means that I cannot cite this book properly."
2,Mediocre DVD,This DVD is great for showing you how to build the bases of your village but does NOT give or show great detail on the assembling of your village. The Village Vignettes DVD is a much more detailed DVD!!!
1,Misleading and disappointing,"This is basically a 30 minute commerical for the Place and Plug strips. It shows how to create one temporary and one permanent base out of styrofoam... and that is it. There are no techniques or display suggestions given at all. The focus of the video is about ""how great the Place and Plug strips are to use,"" and ""how the cords are more easily hidden when you use the Place and Plug strips.""I guess I just paid a lot of money to watch a commercial."
3,"Good Strip Show, Same Old Boring Plot","Tane Mcclure happens to be Shannon Tweed's daughter who after being cheated by her husband with gorgeous Wendy Schumacher remembers her past and tries to take revenge like her mother did on the first part. Perhaps it is not Tane's fault to try to take Shannon's role on this movie, but she gives everything she has to try to make of this a good movie. But the character just fits big. There's only one Shannon Tweed in the world. What's really worth to see on this film is Wendy's beautiful and fresh body who should be the star on this extremely hot, erotic, and plotless film."
2,Tane McClure is good but she's better in Stripshow,This movie isn't very good at all. If you're a Tane McClure fan I suggest stripshow... This film is just kind of dull. Tane McClure is much better in Stripshow period (.)
2,Scorned 2: Are sequels better than the originals? No!,"Hello...i am a viewer of all sorts of films and when i watched this film i was outraged. Being a previos Scorned Part1 viewer, watching this unknown actress Tane McLure act was one of the most terrifying acts ever. I wished that the producers would have asked Shannon Tweed to act in this once again. She was better looking and a better actress! THis gets a 2 Star count from me!"
5,AVERAGE MOVIE,"I GAVE IT 5 STARS FOR TWO REASONS TANE AND WENDY.PRETTY GOOD SEQUEL.DOESN'T SURPASE THE ORIGINAL BUT WHAT MOVIE DOES.THIS IS A MUST SEE,AND HAVE FOR FANS OF THESE KINDS OF MOVIES...........CAN'T WAIT TILL PART 3 COMES OUT IN 2002 SHANNON WILL SUPPOSEDLY BE RETURNING IT WILL ROCK..........."
4,A great book for anyone wanting to use or using PowerJ,"I greatly enjoyed the author's informal writing style and the amount of material covered in the book. If you are starting to learn PowerJ or are already using it, this book is for you! This book doesn't just help you get started but covers chapters on ActiveX and JavaBeans as well as using graphics.Make no mistake, this is the only book you'll need for information about PowerJ!"
1,Rehash of PowerJ Documentation,There is nothing in this book that isn't in the PowerJ documentation. I was really disappointed as it looks like a simple regurgitation of the manuals that comes with PowerJ. One appeal of the book is that you can log onto a web site and leave messages for the author. The only problem is that the author has not responded to any of those messages in about a month. Don't waste your time on this book. Sybase newsgroups are a better source for support.
1,Book useless without the CD-ROM,The book does not come with any CD-ROM so without anything to try things out on the book is quite useless. However if you already have a copy of PowerJ you might have som use of the book.
2,Sorry Tim...not much detail where needed.,"I found the book to be very basic! So basic that at times I thought it was teaching me how to use Windows instead of how to use/program with PowerJ. I would recommend this book for those who are coming from the UNIX environment or do not have much of an understanding of Windows and would like to start programming with PowerJ.PowerJ is a fantastic programming environment and can be a great enterprise tool! However, there needs to be more literature presented to get people going in the right direction. Unfortunately, I think this book falls short with jump starting the programmer using PowerJ and Java."
1,Expensive and thin,"At best a well presented series of screen shots - at worst a fairly cynical attempt to exploit the lack of PowerJ books. Nothing new, no difficult or useful code where you would have NEEDED help, and no real attempt to stretch PowerJ to its limits."
1,Disappointed with the book!,The book is a summization of the the PowerJ manual. You are better off with the manual that comes with the product and the newsgroups. I was expecting coverage of advance topics. No useful code examples or CD! The is over priced and of little value in helping one advance in the use of PowerJ.
4,Quick but know your cables,"I bought these to attach my Audioquest type 8 cables to my Pass Labs amp. If you have very stiff or thick cables I would not try to use these, too difficult to bend the strands down for the crimp lock. These are designed for multi-strand with many thin strands.Second, do not try to bend the spades to get a different angle. I tried cause they were sticking up too far to clear my amp's cable connection wingnuts. They snap off.Know your equipment and cables before you buy these, would be great for typical Monster cable."
5,Works great,"I bought these to make it easier to attach/detach my Klipsch speakers. They were very easy to use. The spade disconnects from the black base. You run the cable up through the base, fan out the wire, and then screw the spade back on. It makes a nice tight connection so you won't hear any speaker pops.Don't expect them to 'improve your sound' unless you didn't have the bare wire set correctly in the first place. Don't expect them to 'protect the copper from corrosion' either. No connector is air tight and copper is fairly resistant to corrosion anyway.Also, make sure you look at the back of your speaker / receiver before buying these. Some terminals (e.g. some Dennon receivers) aren't compatible with spades."
5,What can be said about Vangelis other than he's a HUGE genius!,"I've known and had Themes for a very long time. I can remember driving around in L.A. listening to it in my car. It stood out as so unique and incredible with all the synthesizers and sounds he creates with them. There really is nothing else like it in music that I know of. Truly, completely unique, there is not one weak track on this disc! If you love synthesizer music plus pure artistic sensibility, this is the disc. Vangelis shows his genius over and over again and it's quite stunning to listen to. I LOVE this disc. Buy it!"
4,Vangelis Themes,"Originally I got this CD for wedding music (my bride wanted HYMN from the Album ""Opera Sauvage""). Then I found out how well the other soundtracks on this CD were composed and played. I especially liked the composer's interpretation of CHARIOTS OF FIRE from the Album ""Chariots of Fire"". I decided this would be appropriate music for the candle lightning ceremony before the wedding. This CD is a good starter album for those hearing the Vangelis music for the first time or wanted to start a Vangelis collection."
5,Exquisite...exquisito!,"I first purchased this in cassette way back in the Philippines when I was over there....I have since purchased it in CD and have yet to tire of it, even after all these years...there is so much textures on these electronic melodies...these themes are gathered from a wide range of film soundtracks from ""The Bounty"" to ""Bladerunnner"" and of course ""Chariots of Fire"" ...favorites of mine""The Tao Of Love"", ""Theme From Antartica"", and ""Love Theme From Bladerunner""...the music invokes so much more than the great film soundtracks...much of the music has a melancholic touch...with some unexpected upliftings turns...if you listen to this CD on headphones in the dark you are in for an experience bordering on the mystical..."
3,Quite impressive.,"Vangelis is a very good musician. I got Themes a few months ago in order to acquire a comprehensive taste of his music. I really enjoy listening to this collection from time to time. It's quite ambient and relaxing. Every one of the pieces is satisfying and has something to offer. Vangelis plays all of the instruments himself, and his keyboard work is very good, indeed. He is the composer, arranger, and producer. All fourteen tracks are keyboard-based instrumentals. I'm very impressed with two of them. ""Chung Kuo"" and ""Love Theme from 'Bladerunner'"" are great pieces. ""Chung Kuo"" emanates wonder and mystery and sports attractive keyboard textures. ""Love Theme from 'Bladerunner'"" is an emotional and enjoyable track, also. Both of these tracks are infectious, beautiful, and imaginative. I'm glad that I got Themes because it really is quite impressive. I actually give it 3.5 stars. I recommend it."
1,computer overheats,"great machine to work with, but i sent it back to hp 3 times for a replacement board, graphics card always blows out, don't know why as i have provided plenty of ventilation by keeping the machine space free of any objects near its vent.what's frustrating is that i can't find any info on the internet of anyone else having this problem, and the machine is acting up again for the 4th time, especially in 1400x900 mode.everytime i get it back from hp, the resolution is always set to 1200x800 instead of 1400x900, and it has been 3 returns already, which tells me that the manufacturer has built boards with inferior components in it."
2,Relaxation Body Scan & Guided Imagery for Well-Being,"I was very disappointed after reviewing this CD. I was hoping it would relax me so I could fall asleep. Instead, after listening for an hour, I got up and ate and stayed awake for 3 hours. I found the harp in the background to be quite annoying. I was really expecting to hear some nature sounds in the background, i.e. ocean, etc. Sorry that I am not writing anything positive."
1,USELESS,"This product was horrible! The kids sure couldn't mold it - it was like a brick. I broke the thing in half but it was so hard and crumbly that it was useless. It went directly into the trash, no value at all. Very disappointing."
5,This one will make a fan out of anybody!!!!,"I've been a Statler Brothers fan for years and this is as good as it gets! Each song shows why they are called The Entertainers. Little Jimmy's vocals in ""When the Roll is Called Up Yonder"" will send chills up your spine. This is a must, don't pass it up!!"
5,Great underground hip hop!,"This is great, intelligent underground hip hop... Almost every song on this CD is witty, intelligent, and slamming. If you like REAL hip hop and enjoy complex and intriguing lyrics, then this CD is for you."
4,Defending Hip hops Roots,"I bought this Cd recently just because i Do not own a Cd by the Canadain Group Swollen Members and Since Madchild Is the driving force behind this Compilation i wanted to see what songs he helped put together for this Album...Not a bad selection albeit some of the tracks heard on this album are on many other compilations or Cd's its a good mix of whose who in the underground scene..Dialted peoples..Non-phixion..the arsonist..Aceyalone and many more....The Track i like most that stands out to me is the ""Variety"" track by Moka Only..He sounds like a poor mans Common..True hip hop for those of you not into material Shining.."
2,"Plodding Production, Boring Lyrics","Featuring Kool Kieth, Del, Aceyalone, and the Arsonists, among others, I thought this album might be ok.""OK"" about sums it up. The beats are pretty repetitive and most of the songs consist of simple loops. Kool Kieth and Aceyalone tracks have the most interesting lyrics and are the best in my opinion, but they def don't carry the whole thing.I can see why some people might like this, but I'm more into interesting production (IMHO) from guys like El-P, Shadow, Automator, Blockhead, and Amon Tobin to name a few. If you're really into those guys' work, this album might not be for you.Don't buy it unless you want to buy my copy from me ;)"
3,disappointing,"i picked this cd up because the cover reminded me of the orgasmo cavalcade of thugs lp, and it had tracks from a lot of big name ""underground"" m.c.s i was disappointed to find that only one track was worth buying - the rest are boring. props to kool kieth for bringing new concepts to hip hop. if you like creative futuristic underground hip hop i would recomend celestial squadron or beneath the surface instead. defenders of the underground was a waste of my money."
4,Good textbook structure - mediocre quality of online section,"The book has a good structure and has good chances to become a standard textbook in MBA classes or for industry newcomers. However, to make it a real classic it badly needs a second edition. First, there are too few (good) case examples. Second, the online tools are far from complete (something like this should never be published!). Third, the exercises need revising and are partly inconsistent or reptitive. (Comments based on online tools and materials as of June '01)"
4,Prison Movie,Saw this once when I was a teenager. I liked it then and still like it now. Item was to me way before expected and in shape described.
3,Not as strong as Lord of Sin,What a bore. The last thing you want to feel when your reading an escape book but I felt it throughout this dragging book. I read the Lord of Sin and thought it moved along better.
3,Liked it for the mystery not the romance,"I thought the characters were rather bland, however I thouroughly enjoyed the mystery sub plot.Lady M. is your typical Regency lady, who at first denys her attraction to the hero Nathaniel, only to succumb to his charms. Oh, she did sleep with him at an orgy 1 month before the book starts. The books title 'A lady of sin' is quite misleading, because there isn't any sizzle in her character. Nathaniel stands out more, and his potrayal as a defense lawyer is nicely done. I like how Hunter shows how out of place he would have been at that time. Also, since he is such a gentleman, Lady M comes across a bit shrewish at times, but I have resigned myself to that expectation in regency romance.All in all, not a bad read."
4,When your first date is at an orgy....,"....you might not think small talk is important. Yet this romance is very much based not just on the sensual but on recognizing and deeply understanding another person. The two main characters face their one night encounter with maturity but are haunted with the notion that just maybe there is more to discover and care about. Side stories echo this notion with mysteries about secret marriages, politics and love of children--blood related or not. Excellently done and wonderfully romantic."
2,Not as good as i expected,"John is a good drummer who plays pretty hard music i play stuff a little softer than that. These do not last very long I practice about an hour a day and they broke in a month! These pretty bad sticks there cheap...they dont last long, i personally don't like the wy there shaped(that may be just me becuz im pissed off i gotta go buy new sticks now).Heres my suggestion go ahead and buy ahead drumsticks they are hard plastic if youre a drummer that does lots of stuff with the rims of your drums then ahead isnt for you but if dont use the rims buy these they dont break they only problem with ahead though is that the fact they can fall apart, and the tip can be screwed off.SUMMARYbuy ahead drumsticks or buy stronger wood sticks."
3,"In-Depth, Scholarly Read","Wimmer, after a brief discussion on hemaneutics, goes through a detailed study of the major relevant passages in the NT Gospels defining fasting, including a look at comparisons or contrasts to Jewish and Hellenistic history and cultural. Although Wimmer states that fasting was practiced in the early Church, he contends there is not much said about it in the rest of the NT. For that reason, only the Gospels are engaged.This book is very informative and insightful. From a non-scholar's perspective, the hermaneutics is quite in-depth but easy to follow. A good read to strengthen your own personal grounds for maintaining fasting as a legitimate NT discipline."
5,"Stark, Powerful Music","As with ""The Lonesome Jubilee"", the lyrics are what make this collection of songs stand out. Younger, more radio-dependent fans may not have enjoyed this album, but anyone capable of paying attention to the lyrical content had to have been deeply affected. ""Jackie Brown"" is an absolutely hearbreaking tale of one poor man's struggle, and the irony of ""Pop Singer"" is underscored by the sheer brilliance of the music. ""Country Gentleman"" and ""JM's Question"" paint some truly ugly pictures of the hypocrisy and greed so prevalent in late 80's America; John wasn't about to sugar-coat the truth! Overall, this album may not grab every fan on the first listen, but it's well worth lending another ear. For his own peace of mind, it's good that Mellencamp has lightened up since ""Big Daddy"", but the truths spoken here needed telling."
4,The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth,"Classic Gygax 1st ed. dungeon crawl: illogical, unrealistic, extremely combat-heavy, and basically a lot of fun. Can almost be converted to D20 rules while you play."
2,WTF?,i ordered The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth and i was super excited about this vintage module but only got a outer cover!? WTF?
2,Disappointed,"This is a cheaply made cable, for too much money. When you get it, the MIDI IN/OUT jacks are glued together, wire to wire. This is all fine and dandy if you're using it for one keyboard (which since it's by Casio I guess the target audience would), but my keyboard and synth rack are on opposite sides of my workspace. You can rip the glue apart to seperate them but it makes the cables feel very flimsy.Connecting the cable to the Joystick port on my sound card would have been a lot easier if the connector had thumbscrews. Instead, it has mini-flathead screws.The MIDI OUT jack seems very flimsy. Every so often I have to check on it to make sure it's in all the way. This was quite frustrating as all my synths would be playing one minute, then nothing would be playing.Look for something better, or make it work."
5,Another wonderful work,"Angie has outdone herself on this, her third book, to inspire us in the various ways that we can leave our story to the generations that follow. In addition to her illumination of the topic, the beautifully created examples are fabulous eye candy. An all around inspirational and well organized book from a publishing house that cares about it's authors."
5,Patrick IHE,There's a fly on my toast! by Justin Matott is a book of poems. A Book at Night is really calming. There's a fly on my toast is when fly poop gets on his toast! Justin Matott has been a good author for many years. Nightmares is scary and funny. In the song his mom wants his room clean so he puts clothes under his bed. It is a fantastic book.
5,Another Great Book by Matott,A wonderful book for all ages!My three year old loves the poems and it is one of the few bedtime story books that I actually enjoy reading to him.Real life perspective and witty humor are seldom combined in such potent verse.Keep Mr. Matott writing!
5,It does not get better than this.,"There is little to add in terms of praise for such an exacting and thorough exploration of Islam, and this is only the first of a three volume set. Long held in esteem by academics, post doc students and the interested public and quoted in far ranging areas, including the recent Revenge of Geography by Robert Kaplan. In today's world this and its other two volumes deserve to be required reading for even the general populous and definitely for the painfully trite western news personalities (BBC and CBC excepted here) that pontificate."
5,Hodgson,"Hodgson's work has influenced much of American scholarship on the Middle East since the 1960s, and that influence is still going strong."
1,There are better resources out there,"Since you're reading about this book, I assume you're interested in a scholarly work, as opposed to ""Idiot's Guide"" or ""___ for Dummies"" style. In this case, I recommend that you read instead ""The Legacy of Jihad"" by Andrew Bostom and Hugh Fitzgerald, a scholarly work that is more comprehensive, better researched, and more objective. I purchased both books, but after reading a few hundred pages of both, I decided to keep ""The Legacy of Jihad"" and return ""The Venture of Islam"" to the bookstore."
2,Just Okay ...,"While I'll agree that it is the first of it's kind, the book is lacking.It goes throught the history of dinosaur sculpting which is very informative, but the rest of it leaves you wondering - wondering what happens next. As shown in the old cartoon with the two mathematicians and the huge formula on the blackboard. In the center of the big equation it says ""Then a miracle occurs."" Thats what happens here.They show armature and applying the clay, then they show terrific examples of their work. Huh? What happened in the middle? How did they get from ""A"" to ""C"". Obviously ""B"" was left out. They show you how to do it, but they don't show you how it's done.Nowadays there are better sculpting tutorials on the net for free. Basically every sculpt is just armature, and clay. It's just a matter of what you do with the clay.Sadly, this book could have been much better."
1,Painfully inauthentic,"The producer of this film was seemingly well meaning in his intent, however this is the worst movie I have seen in years. It's a fictional ""docudrama"" about the beliefs and struggles of certain Hopi traditionalists, however the actors are blatantly white people, and the plot and dialogue of the film is painfully contrived - especially when the producer attempts to convey Hopi wisdom and prophecy. It all comes across as a white man's fantasy, certainly not representing the voice of aboriginal people, or the dignity of their histories and struggles. I ordered this film hoping for archival footage of Hopi elders speaking, which the name and vague description alludes to. Don't be fooled -- if you are interested in authenticity, look elsewhere. (I'd recommend the film Broken Rainbow as a great alternative in this genre)"
1,I'd give it one half star but it works as a paper weight.,"A tremendously successful textbook---de rigeur for the Ivy League, apparently---whose success can only be explained by kickbacks and graft. The tome is impenetrable, dense with turgid and unhelpful examples, burdened with the authors' pathetic attempts at humor, and manages to make the most basic of financial concepts (such as CAPM, the dividend controversy, and optimal capital structure) incomprehensible to all but the most steely Wall Street veterans. No wonder the street loves it---it makes the discipline seem completely beyond the ken of mere mortals (and first year MBAs). I hate this book with a black passion; it seems to revel in its obscurantism. An infinitely better approach for the curious or the novice is Ross and Jaffe's Corporate Finance, which treats the same material in a logical, user friendly, and infinitely more readable fashion."
2,Unclear wording makes it more uncomprehensive.,"I am an MBA student, formerly a consultant in Big Five with six years of financial experience. This book is awful - wording is ambiguous, explanation sometimes is incomplete, examples are misleading, poor sense of squeezed humour and mixture of pride and prejudice. It was recommended as core textbook but honestly after I read it I could not see why the book is so popular - maybe most B-schools like to make MBA courses more theoritical?"
2,Do not choose it as your first finance texkbook.,"I was required to use this book in my first year MBA, and found that finance is too tough to study. And I was almost discouraged to select finace as my major ONLY BEFORE I found ""Analysis for Financial Management"" by Robert C. Higgins. DO NOT read Brealey & Myers if it is your first finance textbook!"
2,"The pre-eminent finance text, but you have to wonder",I've used it for the core finance course in B-school. Everybody else seems to use it too. It has everything you need but you have to wonder why it's so popular. It gets way too wordy and unclear. It became a major source of discontent in our class and took away from my understanding of finance.
2,Mixed reviews for beginners of finance,"The chapters begin with very simple explanations and scenarios. However, then they seem to jump from that of a very basic level to a high level. Formulas are given without thorough explanations, which make it difficult for those who have had limited finance/accounting experiences. There are other concepts that are explained in more detail but they tend to be the ones that are very basic to begin with. Finally, as the chapters progress, there is more ambiguity. Illustrations don't seem to be very helpful. The study guide (which does not seem to be offered through Amazon yet) helps summarize these chapters. I think this book would be more beneficial for those taking a 2nd level finance course, not the first."
1,Beware of financial managers who study from this book,"I used this book as a part of financial economics component at one of the UK universities. I apologize to the authors, but this is without doubt the worst book I have seen as an undergraduate majoring in economics. The reasons are numerous, I provide a couple of them: 1. You cannot study the topics in the field of finance by relying solely on your intuition and avoiding concepts as trivial as random variables or basic calculus. Since the book is said to be used in the MBA programmes, I believe the title of my review becomes even more relevant. 2. I agree with the reader who claims the authors have a lousy sense of humour. 3. The book is simply too fat. The authors want to speak about everything and manage to analyse - nothing. I have seen at least five books written for the same target audience in the library on a single shelf that would do better than this one."
4,The book is a tough book for a freshman in finance,"I am a financial reporter in Hong Kong and this book is useful in my work.In fact ,the book is not for beginner, but for the financial manager, it describe the theory and practice of corporate finance. In Hong Kong, many financial managers only learn from experience, but for a responsible financial manager need a theory of coporate finance, that can help understanding what is going on the world. The book is quite heavy, but is a good tool book on the desk. The main disadvantage is why the selling price is so high in amazon, I buy the book only Hk $150, about 20 dollars!"
3,A Reader from San Francisco,"As a current MBA student who does not have strong background in finance, I found that the material in this book is often too difficult to understand. This book is more appropriate for financial managers or students whose majors are finance. I highly recommend all finance professors who teach introductory or intermediate finance courses not use this book. Trying to understand materials in this book may discourage your students who does not have strong backgrounds in finance."
2,Very overrated text,"Brealy and Meyers, generally, do a good job in laying out the fundamential concepts of corporate finance. However, wording is unclear, some examples are incomplete or suffer from clarity, and some problems and examples don't explaing how intermediate values used are actually determined. Overall, the book can be confusing and should be taught in conjunction with course teaching. Independent reading can lead to improper understanding."
1,Wrong Edition,The user lied about the edition of the book. I was looking for a tenth edition and i ended up with a fifth edition which is not relevant at all.
4,"An earlier, gentler Hartman","Savoy should be commended for reissuing these 1947 Johnny Hartman recordings that debuted on the Regent label, but you'll have to be a Hartman completist to rank them with his later efforts. Instead of the gentle but strong Johnny Hartman of the immortal duet album with John Coltrane, this is a soft-voiced, almost uninspired balladeer trying not to intrude as he sings 10 standards and four alternate takes. ""Just You, Just Me,"" ""Why Was I Born,"" ""Just a Wearyin' for You,""""There Goes My Heart,"" ""I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart"" and ""I'll Never Smile Again"" show you how the later Hartman evolved. And if you really want this CD, look instead for another reissue, ""With Love: Complete Regent Recordings,"" on the Jazz Factory label. It has all of these songs, plus 17 others, for only a few dollars more."
3,"Tight fit for a K20D, tough zipper","The top zipper gets stuck and is difficult to move because of the plastic ""weather-proofing"" plastic material surrounding the track. This alone is the reason why it gets 3 stars.For anyone who's interested: it's an uncomfortable squeeze to get a Pentax K20D body to fit - it barely does, but you have to squeeze/shove your fingers against the side to reach down and grab the camera grip to yank it out. The depth (or height) is good for a Tamron 28-75 2.8 with the lens hood on (barely). Unfortunately, the camera case probably won't be of much use to me because the top opening is just a little too small for my camera body."
4,"hold my pentax DSLR with zoom, but not additional lens","I bought this after some research. I need one that can hold my DSLR with 50-200 zoom. It definitely works to that purpose. But it has no space for an additional lense. Anyway I wanted a very compact one from the beginning.It comes with one sticky pad/holder/separator. It has a relatively small hole, not big enough for the lens hood. I haven't figured out how to use the separator effectively.Great build quality. comfortable to carry around without drawing too many attentions."
2,Used for a '97 Corolla DX,"The Mount is a little bit big for the setup, but I was able to get the stereo installed just fine. Cheap plastic, confusing instructions, but hey, that's par for the course when you buy these things."
3,All Plastic,"Was expecting heavier duty brackets, All plastic. Returned, Used original steel OEM mounts. i had to send it back A"
1,junk dont buy.,I bought this item thinking it would save me time boy i was wrong this thing comes in pieces you have to build it you're self and cut plastic pieces out spend the extra 5$ for a better design.
2,great if the system would not die,"great if the system would not die. I am now purchasing my third one. Love the games, but the power button just stops and it never works again."
1,Waste of Money,"I bought this last christmas, for my 2 1/2 year old. I was very exicited about it, But what a joke, half the time it does not work, the graphics are horrible. The games are hard to figure out for kids in the 3 year old age group. My 5 year old niece also had a hard time with it. The kids get frustred while playing a game and graphics just black out. I would not recomand this toy to anyone. I have since bought leapfrog products way better."
4,Vsmile TV Learning System Pink,This is our 3 system the first one that was out the handheld and now the pink. The first 2 were junk. We've had this for a year now and it's still working frankly I can't believe it. My daughter loves the note pad and microphone. Vsmile products are buy at your own risk.
1,Joystick malfunction,I bought this toy for my 3 year old daughter for christmas this year. But unfortunately I have to return it because the joystick does not work. I checked out other reviews and complaints and it seems that alot of people have complained about the joysticks! Very cute but not very good quality!
2,Not so good!!!,"Okay I have to say I think this game is awful!!! I was expecting soooooo much more for the $60 we payed for it at walmart!!! With that being said the only game we have played is the Alphabet Park game which came with it. I am still holding out hope that other games will be better. The picture quality is not so good. The fact that it has to have batteries and doesnt just plug in is soooo anoying. But Most importantly it is soooooooooo complicated!!!! I have a hard time coordinating some of it, and my daughter who is only 3 is constantly frustrated! Cause you have to do so much, its not good for a 3 year old in my opinion and I am hoping when she is a little older it will come a little easier for her! I am wondering why they advertise it as a 3 and up toy! I wish I hadnt bought it at all! What a waste of money for a 3 year old!"
2,Waste of precious resources...,"My 4 year old daughter cannot figure it out... that's not to say no 4 year old cannot, but mine certainly can't.She can jump or move,but not both at the same time. AND is asking me to help her...Doesn't include D/C... but you can buy the 9 volt plug at any electronics store probably cheaper than directly from v-tech.The graphics... Think pre-original Nintendo arcade game.NEEDS MAJOR IMPROVEMENT.The game should be more rudimentary for toddlers.As for the sing-a-long... way too fast, even for me, especially between sentences... Needs to be slower to give time to learn the song and then faster... and needs more time between phrases.The letter tracing game is pretty stupid. Kids don't even really know they are tracing letters. And the little writing pad is soo small.(I think I have any older version of the V-Smile since the picture I see here doesn't have a microphone or writing pad, or perhaps a different version.)"
2,Broke after 3 uses,"My dad bought this for my 4 year old daughter for her birthday. I put it on her wish list so I was very excited when she got it. As far as operation, set up, and visuals, it is fine. The only issue I had with it is that it broke after 3 uses. My daughter didn't drop it or rough house it at all. I was very upset. Not very durable at all."
1,complete bust,"The installation instructions included in the product package (a clamshell package; I'm not talking about the outer shipping box) were not for the purchased product. They were for a more complex product that really did need installation instructions. This product should have been a simple plug-it-into-the-wall-outlet device, but it has a long, fixed-in-place screw centered between its 2 sockets. You must remove the faceplate from the wall to install it. You can't remove the screw, and you can't NOT fasten it--it is too long. When I tried to fasten that center screw, something went wrong, because there was a snap and a big spark. I think the device got fried. It's now sitting in its shipping container on a table, making me mad every time I see it."
4,Great little surge protector,"This is a great item, works great for the tv and PS3 in my bedroom. Be aware though, there are two ground prongs on the back of the plug, it will require both spaces on a duplex receptacle."
3,Does NOT protect internet/fax/modem line,"I have purchased Monster surge protectors in the past and have had good luck with them. I expect the same with this one. However, the reason I am writing this review is to WARN others that the description on this product is NOT correct. The description states ""Protects internet/fax/modem line from damaging pulses and discharges caused from surge pulses"". There are NO input/outputs on this surge protector for an internet/fax/modem line. If you want a compact Monster surge protector with internet/fax/modem line protection get the Monster HTS200(FlatScreen PowerCenter)."
3,Ok,"Item was OK, Was suppose to fit behind the TV. It was To Big with the small profile TV mounts. I used a 14 foot cord and connected to my major surge protector.The monster 1000 with Clean 2 power."
5,Easily one of the greatest albums you'll hear,"This album by Bud Powell is sheer delight to listen to. The first half of the cd was recorded with Sonny Rollins, Fats Navarro, Tommy Potter, and Roy Haynes in 1949. These guys are all at the top of their game here. Several originals from Bud and beautiful trio recordings of ""You Go to My Head"" and Charlie Parker's ""Ornithology"" highlight this set as well as the quintet on Monk's ""52nd Street Theme"". The 2nd half is from a trio date in 1951 with Curley Russell on bass and Max Roach on drums. They stroll through such songs as ""Un Poco Loco"", ""It Could Happen to You"", and ""Parisian Thoroughfare"". Another great thing about this cd, is that they have included in an unobtrusive manner, alternate takes of most of the songs. One of the most beautiful recordings I've ever heard. Hearing these guys play together is an amazing thing."
2,Narrow focus - others are better,"I found the book narrow in focus and rather old fashioned. It seemed to reflect a few of the author's personal betes noires eg alternative medicine. I found little that was new in it.There are lots of better books on this topic around eg ""Influence : The Psychology of Persuasion""."
1,People in glasshouses,"The author writes about the poor statistical knowledge of the plebs, while simultaneously displaying his own poor statistical knowledge, always in a haughty tone.For example, he writes about the low autocorrelation of free-throw percentage, mocking the people that think that there is such a thing as a hot streak, while ignoring the obvious fact that people vary over time. I guarantee you that Michael Jordan age 6 had a different free throw percentage than he did at age 26, and different again than at 46. There are lots of these sorts of insidious, misleading observations, all couched in a holier than though tone and attempting to argue from authority."
5,Hit the nail on the head,"I've read a lot of books on logic, argument, and critical thinking. This is the best one I've read for explaining the psychological reasons behind faultly logic. This book is going on my list of books to read every few years so as to inoculate myself from the described fallibilities in human reasoning. I will be recommending this to everyone I know. Unfortunately, the ones who need to read it the most probably won't."
5,Worth every page,"Read it and pass it on! I have a business background. My girl friend has a psychology background, and we both enjoyed it as much as each other. The impact of self-fulfilling prophecies, confirmatory search strategies or hidden data problems, ..., second hand-information biases, ... or ESP, are all so common in our everyday life. But still, unless you are made aware of them, you often fail to notice them and act upon them. This book is worth every page!"
3,Interesting but dense,"This book relates to critical thinking, but rather than focus on the use of language (semantics) or argument structure (logic), it addresses the psychology of our thinking. In other words, why are positive connotations more ""attractive"" to us that negative ones (e.g., ""All men are mortal"" vs. ""All non-mortals are non-men""), or why do we believe in ESP, urban myths, and the like. It is an interesting book with application to all of our lives. On the negative side, I agree with the reviewer who complained that this book bogs down in jargon. I often found myself losing focus of the main points due to the heavy smattering of statistical and supporting data. Bottom line: this book is fascinating but it requires a lot of focus to get through."
4,Insightful and concise,A great read with plenty of scientific backing. An excellent reminder of how easy we misinterpret the world in which we live.
1,A poor imitation ........,"The music that Narell is playing here is a sad imitation of the great band he had with Steve Erquiaga, Will Kennedy, Keith Jones, Kenneth Nash, etc ......... What happened ?"
5,Medi Rub 2000 plus,I'm diabetic and there is numbness behind my toes. This massager makes my feet feel much better. I use it at least four times a week. Great product!
1,Very disappointed.,"We got the MediRub Foot Massager to counteract the effects of neuropathy primarily in my wife's feet as the result of chemotherapy. Although the machine seems very well constructed, all it does is vibrate. There is no ""massage"" to the action at all. The bumpy surface may keep your feet from slipping off, but it has no independent effect on the feet at all. Unfortunately, I threw the box away after we opened it or I would have sent the item back for a refund. It is a pretty expensive apparatus.Bottom line: if you want some kind of ""massage"" action, do NOT get the MediRub Foot Massager"
2,not so medi,"i only tried this medirub for 2 days...but that was enough for me to know that this wasnt the foot massager for me. when i placed my feet on the medirub without shoes, it felt like i had my feet on a bag of wasps. i then put it on low and that felt like a bag of mosquitoes. so,i put my shoes on and it was more tolerable. but the medirub was on a tiled floor and kept moving away from my body. i ended up sending it back. though, the first time i used it for aprox 10mins, it made my feet feel, only slightly better. like from a 3 to a 2.25(even thought im not supposed to use fractions/decimals)"
2,"A vibrator, not a massager!","This foot massager does not really massage--in the sense that it applies useful pressure at particular points to relax or knead muscles. It simply vibrates, tingling the feet and ankles with vibration. If this is what you are looking for you might like it. If you are looking for any kind of deeper massage you will be disappointed."
1,Broke in 10 Min!,I read good reviews and bought at last min. for my fiance for Christmas. I paid a lot for freight and she was so excited to use it... There was not much in the way of a manuel.... but there is a swith for low and high.... so we just plugged it in and started using it. It was working just fine for 10 min. then it stopped... Very disapointing for an expensive massager!
2,MediRub Foot Vibrator has some problems!,vibrates (walks)away from user (on ANY floor other than very thick carpet). WAY Too harsh for a diabetic. Way Too noisy to watch TV with. Forced to wear shoes(feet platform is hard plastic waffle pattern). Who wants a foot message with their shoes on? I am a diabetic and the last thing I want is to wear vibrating shoes and get a foot abrasion that will not heal. This unit damaged my neuropathy feet after 3 sessions of 15 minutes each over three days. Returned product using amazon's great return policy.
3,Nice selection of ring tones.,"Caller id is a pain because of 2 things. 1. it reads out the name the way your phone recieves it. So if a call comes in and it says wireless caller, it will read out wireless caller instead of the number. That doesn't do me any good. 2.To see the number of the wireless call you have to wait for it to scroll over to it. It doesn't appear underneathe it. I would not recommend this phone if you are a busy person and like to screen your calls."
2,Not so fast...,"A rather cheeky attempt to rope a number of 20th century heroes into the postmodern progressive corral. Each of them is quite beyond the academic tropes deployed here, though the writing does have a clunkily sensitive tone to it. But academicese is no fit language with which to extol these people. Stick with the general audience classics."
1,"Poor Quality, Big Price","I own the Archos AV400 and owned the model before it, so I expected the Archos AV700 to be a step up. It's a step backwards. It records, then during playback distorts the image. It looks foggy and grainy with lines. When I called Archos, I was told that there are no settings to adjust to improve the image. Needless to say I returned it 4 hours after buying it.Archos should not be in such a rush to be pioneers (7"" screen) that they release products before they are perfected."
1,Archos AV-700,"I bought the AV700 about a month ago. It looked real nice out of the box but would not interface with my computer because of its faulty plug and play and would not download my MP3 music or my videos because it did not support dvd format. So reluctantly I sent it back. Too bad, I really wanted it to work.It looks like, they put out the product too soon without spending the time to make it user friendly."
1,Archos will milk you too,"I bought one of the (relatively) newest mp3 players on the market several years ago. It was a Jukebox Studio 20 from Archos. I wrote to them as I was experiencing some problems with charging the batteries and told them I used an Apple computer. They gave me a return authorization, I shipped it in, they charged me a fee for the fix, shipped it back. I wrote back saying I couldn't get the unit to work with an Apple and they simply replied that Apple's OS wasn't supported. I wrote back saying that I had specifically told them I used a Mac but never got a reply again... Maybe I should have reported them with the Better Business Bureau. You can save yourself a headache (and being robbed) by simply not buying any Archos products."
1,I'd rather had the money for Christmas!,"What, almost $800 bucks for this POS? Do you have nothing less than 1 star?Don't get me wrong I got this for Christmas and will not return it because it was a gift, but I'd never have purchased it for myself knowing what I know now!Ok lets see, I now have the priviledge to buy dvd converting software to convert my movies I want to watch as I travel, and spend 2-4 hours on each conversion to AVI(divx), and while my computer is at 100% CPU usage (even with athlon 64, 2gigs ram) so I can't get any other WORK done, [and RE-CONVERT them when the conversion doesn't sync the audio with the video] I guess I can read the freakin newspaper for the rest of the week!?Leave it to the <sniff sniff> French to invent a shiny, nice-to-look-at, but very impractical petit morceau de merde!!!G Storey"
4,Very Nice PVR.,I have this AV700 (100G) for few months and here are the cons ans pros:Good Things:* Works nice and fast (boots up fast and USB2 works very fast).* Movies are looking preaty good on it and on TV.* Great sound whn connected to headphones and stereo player.* shaped nice.* Woroks very nice with the remote control.* You can slow mothion movies.Bad things:* Archos costumer service is the worst I've seen!!!* Internal speaker are poor.* LCD disply is very fragile.* Resolution while watching pictures is not good.* When watching a 4:3 movie it streaches it and if you change the settings for it so it wont be strached it doesn't remeber it afterwords.* File managment and options is not so friendly.it could have been nice if it had:* MS WORD reader.* PDF reader.* Option to recive radio and TV antena signal.Over all its a nice product that needs to be handled carefuly.
1,archos av700 support,I purchased the 100gb AV700 IN DECEMBER 2005. It stopped working in May 2006.I returned it (at my own expense) for repair June 2006. Received it back after 4 weeks. After 1 hour it stopped working. Despite assurances from Archos I still haven't been able to return item for repair. Their customer and tech support is nonexistant. Purchase this item at your own risk.
3,"Good product, Poor Customer Service","I received an Archos AV700 as a gift just under a year ago. The first one had no sound output, so we called Archos ""Customer Support"" and were told that we should return it to them at our expense and it would take up to 6 weeks to repair. I then contacted the retailer I purchased it from and they sent a replacement.The unit worked well for about 3 months. Then the battery died. I purchased a replacement and that worked for about 5 months.The other day I tried to switch it on and it would not start up. No lights, nothing. Thinking it may be the battery again, I purchased another new one along with a new power supply. Unfortunately this did not solve the problem, so I begrudgingly called Archos to find out how to proceed.Archos informed me that this model is no longer supported and that I need to purchase a newer model.I assume that if I do purchase a newer model, that too will be obsolete in a few months!Beware of very poor customer support!"
3,Don't Buy the adapter listed by amazon,Don't buy the adapter listed by amazon to go with this device. It is sold by Adorama Camera and it is the wrong car lighter adapter. I paid $7.95 for shipping along with $25.95 for the adapter.
2,Customer Service - Unhelpful,"I own an older model and have experienced battery issues. When the unit was on the market and battery concerns were mentioned and Archos said that they would replace the battery if the need arose. Well, I need a new battery and guess what they said. They suggested that I throw away my 20 gig/mp3 player/video player because they no longer support the unit because my model is not current! I can't beleive that something I bought for hundreds of dollars 2 years ago that needs a battery should be tossed.They said if I found a battery that I would still need to find someone handy with solder. When I inquired about the specs of the battery they said they didn't have any of that info.Not to mention that the battery is dead dead and the unit will not turn on even when plugged in. I can't access any of my files.What a crock. I think I will buy something from someone who cares next time. Buyer beware."
5,Great Product.,"While a little expensive, we have been able to load it up with are kids favorite DVD's, and TV shows (and a few of our own) to make travel much more enjoyable. It is very easy to use."
3,Don't try to watch on a big screen!,"I got rid of this after a few months of recording DVDs. I had hoped to replace my DVD with this digital storage, just like I did my CDs. But the resolution on the Archos is so poor (even when you set it to record on its highest resolution, which eats up considerably more storage space)that it broke down into pixels on my 27 inch LCD TV. It works great if all you intend to do is watch it on the Archos player or a tiny TV screen. I guess I should have expected this since the Archos only record thru analog. I also found the recording process very tedious. It is a simple matter of hooking it up to the DVD player and recording, but you have to wait through the 2 plus hour DVD to turn the unit off. You can set it to turn off automatically after a set amount of time, but that dead space at the end of the DVD recording while the machine waits to turn off also eats up your storage space. Overall, a great idea whose time has yet to come for replacing my DVD collection."
5,Great product,"We feed our cat a raw meat diet, and this helps supplement that with all the nutrients he would get as a wild animal (organs, ground bone, etc). It's great!"
4,Tropical garden design.,"Visually inspiring book, great inspiration if you live in the Tropics as I do. Nice to dream about if you dont."
2,You will not learn how to design a tropical garden with this,"If you are looking for a ""How to"" book then this is not it. It has nice pictures of tropical greenery but I did not see any outstanding ""designed"" tropical gardens in the book. A big disappointment."
2,Tropical Garden Design,"I agree with some other reviewers that this is a book for day dreamers. It does not claim to be a guide to tropical garden design and it certainly is not in that category. It is a nice book with many nice early morning photographs of selected beautiful tropical gardens, mostly in Bali. It is a sharing of Michael White's philosophy of garden design oriented around controlled jungles (with high labor input in maintenance) rather than on ""how to do it"".It is also a fitting reminder and proof that one does not need a university degree to be successful at one's chosen profession."
5,stunning,I picked this book up because of its beautiful cover. The inside was just as gorgeous. Wonderful pictures of Bali and other tropical places. I have it out on my coffee table because I want to look at it all the time. You want to enter the pictures and stay there!
4,Good stocking stuffer.,"This is a pocket-sized book that would make an ideal Christmas ""stocking stuffer."" Each page contains photos from the movie, with accompanying lines from the script. It's a sweet, simple little book. If you know someone who is a fan of IAWL, I would recommend picking up a copy for them."
5,Michael Reagan,The book was very good and came exactly as described and on time. I always buy from this place. I will order again. I like that they remember my financial info so I don't have to retype it.
4,Refusing to pass the blame to others... for the last time?,"Michael Reagan had a painful life, including sexual abuse. It took him until he was forty to straighten himself out. He started out to write a score-settling attack on Ronald and Nancy Reagan, but changed his mind and courageously avoids the easy way out of passing the blame. The book is heartfelt and moving, but though sympathetic to the First Family, it confirms some negative aspects of their image. Having done this, though, Mike apparently felt that once was enough, and he has now made a career as a right wing talk show host out of attacking and blaming others on the flimsiest evidence. This book has all the virtues that his later career so conspicuously lacks. Where did they go?"
3,Charlie Swin plys a common theme to meet a common need,"We all need to feel important and worthwhile. However, this need has been played way up to the point that ""self-esteem"" has blinded us to more fundamental conditions. Swindoll has provided a useful template for the individual to be important in the correct context, the church, and in the right perspective, a godly, biblical one. The goal is not to ""feel good"" but to accomplish God's will by becoming all that He commands and wants.As a study guide this will be as good as your group makes it. I found some sections more useful than others. The topic, if you study topics, is one that is very useful in the materialistic, spontaneous culture we live in.I found the questions incongruous to the study material at points. Things didn't quite flow together. However, the guts of the material was well thought out and interesting. Almost 4 stars."
1,Broken bad,"We got ours real fast but real broken. Called amazon who told us to write the company and if we don't get a response within 3 business days, call amazon. I plan to update this later."
5,Great for price,"Price is great for the bench. Packaging is not the best, but I did receive with no damage. Needed two people to put together. Have not found anything that looks as nice for the same price. Love the split bench seat."
3,broken from shipping,"I read the review above mine before buying, but decided to try it anyway. I got the piece in 3 days- nice and quick. Then I opened it up, and the FIRST piece I removed was broken. Great piece of furniture, but the packaging leaves alot to be desired."
3,pathetic packaging,"I agree that the packaging was pathetic and one piece is damaged. The part is not in stock and the company doesn't know if and when it will be in. It seems like a really nice bench, but it's still in the pathetic box it came in."
4,Target Hall Bench,The bench arrived with the packaging torn. All the parts were there however the stain on the arm piece was scratched and the side panel fell off. One of the wooden pegs was also broken. We were still able to put the bench together with out any problems and it looks great for the price. Keep in mind that the stain is a shade lighter than pictured.
2,"Cheap hinges, will spend more $$ next time for better quality","Liked the look of this product which led to its purchase, but after only 9 months of moderate use the left seat hinges have bent. Cannot recommend this product and I will just spend more money on my next bench to ensure I'm getting a higher quality piece that I will actually 'touch and feel' in person; won't be buying any more furniture online."
2,Short Back Storage reveiw,"The quality is that great. It came with a broken piece, and the directions to put it together where not the greatest"
3,"Rather tasty chips, but took a month to arrive!","These pita chips are very crunchy and definitely taste like pesto (almost too much). I would have liked them better if they had more of a sundried tomato taste, though. Overall pretty good quality. I got the 1.5 oz bags - a good little snack size for the afternoon snack attack (prevents me from eating the whole bag if it was a larger size). However, for some reason, I had to wait a whole month to receive this product. I placed the order on Sept 6 and received Oct 5. I'm not sure what happened there..."
4,Good for a beginner,"This is a fairly comprehensive collection of Rush material from the 70's thru the late 80's/early 90's. Personally, I enjoy the first disc more than the second. Their mid-80's output was hit-and-miss at best. Nevertheless, it is an interesting transition the band goes thru on these two cd's. One may also want to look into their 90's material which, by most standards, was a return to form of sorts: back to the harder rock of the 70's. Ironically, this collection runs just like the average Rush album-it's about 2/3rds good and the rest is pretty forgettable. When it's good, it's GREAT. When it's not, it's never worse than dull."
5,"Can't Argue With The Music, But Buy The Albums","No one can argue with the excellent songs here: ""Tom Sawyer,"" ""The Spirit of Radio,"" the ""2112"" excerpt, etc. That said, the ""2112"" excerpt proves my main point about this collection: Rush is an album band. They are not served well by compilations. Though I don't doubt that these are their best (or most of their best) tracks, they sound better in context. Besides, you'll get the full-length versions if you buy the albums instead. Only Rush completists need bother with this."
4,A Nice Sampling Of Rush Material,"This is a good sampling of material from this great band. If you're new to Rush, Chronicles of course is a nice place to start. I do have to admit that this collection left off some songs: ""Yyz,"" ""Marathon,"" and ""Witch Hunt"" for example. It's also strange that ""2112"" wasn't included in its entirety. But you can't fit in everything I guess. Chronicles is a recommended greatest hits package."
3,No doubt there is some great music here but......,"Rush has always been a band of albums and if you don't have the original albums, you really miss out on the greatness of their full recordings. Every time I have listened to this or retrospective I get past of a couple of tunes and can't stand it when I miss part of the original album. The reason I give it 3 stars is because new fans can get a taste. But if you are a new fan, do your self a favor and get the originals."
3,"A good overview, with minor problems","CHRONICLES is a well-designed double-disc overview of the one of the all-time great rock bands, but I'm not sure who it's for. Don't the fans already have all the albums? And it gets dated fast as the band relases more music.On the other hand, this is worth 3 stars because it's fun to hear two cuts from every album over the span of 15 years. If they didn't release this, I would have built a ""two CD sampler"" on my own."
3,Rush can't fit in a compilation,"It's a good overview, but that's the problem, it's an overview. It lacks some tracks that weren't hits (a relative term for Rush), plus there are many great songs that came after it (Nobody's Hero, Roll The Bones & Half The World to name a few). Good for casual fans, but others ahould go for the studio albums."
3,Awesome set list here....,"But the songs aren't remastered to the sound quality of the 1997 album reissues, or the two Retrospective discs.I always thought the retrospectives were redundant- but they're really not, and this is why. The remastering might be a minor thing for you, but I'd rather have the best sound possible (you know, if you can get it.) If you can find this cheap, by all means, pick it up - But DEFINITELY don't spend $30 on it!"
1,Junk.,"I wanted a longer VGA cord for my TV.. (I have a 6' and it works great) so I bought this. It makes the screen darker, Very unclear, and produces a faint Double image that looks like Total Crap! I plugged it into my standard monitor because I thought maybe it was just the long cord into a bigger TV.. nope, Same thing on my Ultra Sharp 17"" monitor. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!! NOT RECOMMENDED TO ANYONE!"
1,My fault,"Indeed, my fault : I should have a better look at the exorbitant post expences of a (very) cheap item."
1,Definitely too vague,"I bought this book because of the positive reviews it got from others but it definitely misses the point with me. Too vague and too opaque to be understood, there is a lot of writing in there that amounts to no practical use about chord harmony. Not for autodidacts for sure."
1,Not a Puzzle- a novelty trick,"I have never been so disappointed with a puzzle. This puzzle took me all of 15 seconds to solve (honestly) because it is a novelty trick and the ""trick"" is not even obscurred in the least. What a disappointment! Don't waste your money for a trick puzzle. When I say trick, I mean that you don't need brainpower to figure this out, you just have to notice (without giving it away) that one piece is quite different from the other three pieces that look like it and it doesn't have to look different- the manufacturer was just sloppy."
3,"The Lost Years,,, now covered",Ever wondered what happened when the Enterprise returned home after its 5 year mission. Captain Kirk gets promoted to Admiral. Spock goes home to Vulcan. And McCoy haves some Medical Lectures. But All in all the crew reunites and this story has 2000 years in the making rather then 5. I enjoyed this tale. It keeps my attention span. A good edition to the star Trek Library.
2,not best Dillard story and uneven ebook quality,"This story is of moderate quality in comparison of some of the other Star Trek books from Dillard. It gives some interesting insights on the 3 main characters but it gives the impression of being written as an afterthought.On the ebook side (on Kindle): the quality would be acceptable for a free e-book from the Gutenberg project but not as a paying version. It has no index or table of contents, the chapter divisions are not marked properly, the styles are not constant through the book and it contains too many typo errors.Such poor quality editions does only advertise badly for the paying ebooks!!!"
2,"dull and not classic trek,","I agree on all points with the other 2 star review on all points,sorry this did not read as classic trek but some bastardized nexgen plotline.really really sorry but this book was so dull I just hated it.Only the most hardcore trekkies could enjoy this book, and those that grew up onnext gen.it only meets the minimal in my opinion of classic trek, and I gotta say againkirk would not have been in the relationship with the bossy boss.I grew up on the series in the 70's as well and I gotta tell ya,I thought this book was horible yes I know I am not in the majority on this one."
3,Avoiding Lawsuits,Fan-produced synopsis and history of the planned Star Trek movie and TV series. Not professionally produced and obviously avoiding lawsuits by paraphrasing everything.
3,They should've stayed lost,One question - Why were they found? I recieved this book as a gift. I started reading it in 1992. I didn't finish it until 1993. Need I say More. The only things this book is good for is1. Teaching you alot about Vulcan and Vulcans.2. Paperwieght
3,An average read. Something to pass the time...,"J. M. Dillard's Star Trek: The Lost Years has an interesting Vulcan premise: The katra, or spirit, of one of ancient Vulcan's mind lords is removed from its archival container to be transported to the Romulans by a childhood acquaintance of Spock's, in an effort to counter the results of years of dominance of Vulcan ""logic"" over Vulcan ""feeling"".Though the overall plot is actually fairly strong, at times the way the characters play out is not quite as entertaining. The overall premise of an ""escaped ancient Vulcan mind lord"" is worthy of further exploration (and maybe even a movie script), but its execution in this book doesn't quite satisfy.Nevertheless, for anyone hankering to know what went on with the Enterprise's crew after their historic five-year mission, this is still an important read."
4,Correction of title,"Please note that you have the authors named revsersed in the order for for this item. It should read Earl J. Wilcox and David L. Rankin, not the way you have it shown. Thank you. Earl J. Wilcox"
2,Book was much smaller than expected.,"I expected a mid-size book. This product was stapled magazine print pages, about the size of a typical paperback, but only 20 or so pages in length."
3,Pretty good.,"This is a pretty good trick book. Now that I buy it, I don't really see any advantage to just searching for tricks on the web. The only advantage is the ability to put it in your pocket when you are going somewhere..."
4,good condition,i was surprised on how good condition the book and shipment of the book which was quik thanks for the servcie
1,I hadn't expected much from this novel...,"...but I am still disappointed with it. I mean, who wants to waste time reading a bomb? Not only is Falling for Mr. Wrong unoriginal, the heroine spends the majority of the novel complaining about having helped her ex-husband become a successful film producer. This chick lit falls into the run-of-the-mill variety -- thus, I suggest you skip it."
1,I Certainly Expected More . . .,"I came away with absolutely nothing after completing Falling For Mr. Wrong.None of the characters throughout the entire storyline had any depth whatsoever; I couldn't connect with any of them. I thought Polly would have at least kept the backbone she ""sort of"" acquired after Johnny walked out but I guess some of us are willing victims to our own pain and suffering. These characters certainly deserve each other. Luana's pet name ""Polly Pushover"" certainly hit the nail on the head.Readers don't waste your time on this novel - you'll just end up frustrated and bemused."
3,"One of the better cartoons, BUT... read on...","I must say i have really high praises for cartoons from the 80's era... although, some parts look like its just paper dolls moving, the level of effort and detail greatly surpasses a lot of todays animations...however, like a lot of cartoons from the 80's, there are so many episodes that just doesn't have certain excitement factors in them... after 1 cd, i had to take a break from it and move on to the next series that i bought. I will still watch it though, but alternating is the best way to go. I dont think i could stand watching all 65 episodes in one go."
2,DEFENDER OF THE EARTH,I was surprised at just how good this cartoon is from what I remember it. The characters a brill: Flash Gordon and the Phantom together in one cartoon. It has to have the best theme music ever created for a cartoon - including anime. Sadly though the disgustingly cheap presentation of this box set ruins it. The DVD's come in paper bags which are placed inside the case. The picture on the outer box looks photocopied. When I received it I first thought it was a bootleg copy. Still it's a cheap way to get all the episodes and the quality of the picture and sound on the disks is good. It really is one of the best cartoons to come out of the 80's. The animation is far ahead of others at this time. The stories are good too and all the characters except for maybe the little monster thing called Snarf. Could've done without him.
4,DVD came in on-time,My Husband was thrilled with this product. It came in on-time and in great condition. I would order from this seller again. We have not watched the show yet so we shall see how it runs soon.
3,Rodger Ramjet- Hero of Our Nation (Deluxe Collector's Edition),"Very ""Campy""! Though it may be too ""highbrow"" for small children, the content contains no mature issues! If you enjoy a good pun, you won't be sorry! Most of the characters and situations are ""dated"" in the sixties, but still can be very funny! Probably would be most enjoyed by adults, especially males, currently attending college!"
4,"The old remote works, too!","My old Toshiba Sd 3205 died on Christmas Day. The family ordered an SD 6915, which arrived for New Years.I use it in S Video mode. It's a trim and friendly little unit. It recognizes the remote from the old unit, which is nice.I wish Toshiba would number the disc slots in WHITE, at the factory. My wife uses white-out tape, to make the numbers more readable for our ageing eyes.I'm still glad to have a 5 disc changer; when it does CD Duty."
1,Doesn't Last,"I bought this DVD player 1 year ago and the laser tracking went out, meaning that no disc can be read - CD or DVD. This is the main component to a DVD player and to repair it costs more than it would to purchase a new machine. I called Toshiba to complain as I believe anything of quality should last more than 1 year. The would not replace the item or even cover the cost of repair. I will not purchase Toshiba again."
1,Hateful J-U-N-K,"What kind of moron designs a 5-disc changer that WON'T PLAY ALL FIVE DISCS without pushing the ""disc skip"" button to go to the next one?Terrible on-screen display. You can't use this as a CD player unless you connect it to a TV, too.If Toshiba had any ethics, these things would be recalled and we'd all get our money back. Note that there is a firmware upgrade available through Toshiba, but only for products with certain serial numbers, and then only if you badger them enough. The firmware upgrade doesn't fix either of the two problems I've listed."
3,toshiba sd 6915 player,"I own 2 of these units and seem to be experiencing the review about the 1/10 second audio drop in the DTS mode ,have called Toshiba they say it is in my ONKYO 502 a/v yet i called onkyo and they are saying it is not the receiver ,plus i have 2 of these players and my other is hooked up to a panasonic sa-he9 a/v and the player does the same thing ,it seems to play great in dolby digital 5.1 and the DTS seems to be just a slight thing i am still trying other set ups .I would like to talk to Jon who wrote the only other review if you read this please e-mail if you will i would appreciate it .thank you freebird771@camden.net this seems to be the only way i could contact you not real computer literate.thanks"
2,"Only turns on at Sunset, does not turn off at Sunrise",What was not clear to me when I bought this product was that it does not turn off at Sunrise. Basically the way it works is that it will turn on at Sunset. You then have to tell it how many hours you want it to stay on after Sunset. This means the lights are either staying on too long or not long enough. It does not have the ability to turn off at Sunrise. I wish I knew this before I purchased. I would recommend if you want something that turns off at Sunrise to get the Aube by Honeywell TI044/U Solar Programmable Timer. The only plus for the Sylvania is that you only need to enter in your area code. Other ones you need to know you latitude and longitude.
2,Sylvania SA 300 timer,Delivery was as expected. Tried to program the timer and the display showed all digits scrambled. Tried to program several times. No readable entry could be made. Send it back as defected.
3,Neutral to a Fault,"The title of this book is tantalizing. I am deeply interested in all three elements: mind, stress and emotions. The author does not seem to be-rather he seems to assume that all readers agree on what they are and so he discusses chemistry (the non-controversial part)with very rudimentary nods to the effect of subjective experience or human satisfaction and suffering. The point of view is very detached. Also it is written in that mildly condescending tone of freshman textbooks."
2,unreadable dvd,"I have tried this dvd in 3 different dvd players (most of which are new, and all of which work perfectly for all other dvd's). It is unreadable on all but one old Philips machine.. the oldest and least sophisticated of all. So the dvd is obviously defective. Quality is also surprisingly poor for such a recent event. Not sure why it wasnt recorded in HD. Too bad.. a great event."
3,Not nearly as good as the real thing,"My husband and I saw this concert when Simon and Garfunkel were in Grand Rapids (Michigan) at Van Andel arena. I left there so excited, I've always loved these two but that concert was the best. They sang so well and seemed happy to be there. They actually interacted with the audience. I wish that was the actual concert that was filmed. The singing is still wonderful on this DVD, but there is none of the interacting with the viewers. I felt Simon and Garfunkel seemed more uncomfortable with each other and most of their remarks just confirmed that they'd had problems. I love Paul's singing, but he always seems so quiet and out of place in front of all those people that it makes me feel bad for him."
1,This is formatted for PAL and will not play in my PS 3 player!,Please be advised that this DVD is in the PAL format and will not play in most DVD players. A total waste of money!
1,Didn't work,I got this as a Christmas present for my dad only for him to find out that it didn't work on two different players. Maybe it's because it is PAL formatted; I really don't know and don't care. Whatever was done to master this disc made it unplayable.
5,Fantastic Concert DVD,This DVD is absolutely perfect. The sound quality fits the prestige of these artists. It is easy to make a good DVD with music like this!
3,Save Your Money,"Okay, I've had this DVD for about three months, and it still hasn't grown on me. Simon and Garfunkel have their moments on this DVD, but they are far and few between. Simon's insistence on pseudo-improvisation on classic songs leaves a bad taste in my mouth, and though he's a fabulous songwriter/musician/singer, his attempt at singing ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" sealed the deal for me.If you want classic Simon and Garfunkel, get the Concert in Central Park DVD."
3,Simon & Garfunkel Old Friends,"When I go to or purchase a concert, I like the artists to sing their songs as they were recorded. That's the way I fell in love with the music. So when I watched this dvd, it wasn't impressed. The Central Park concert was better in my opinion because, in general, they stuck to the original style of the songs. The quality of the picture, along with the fact that they are much younger, is also better."
5,Old Friends- Powerful youthful performance,"I bought this hoping it would be the consummate Simon and Garfunkel concert and it is. Intimate moments with just Paul's guitar and their two voices. A nice mix of songs including some lesser known tunes to round it out. The sound is incredible, the video is exceptional, the band is tight. The boys are in incredible form performing these tunes 40 years after they first recorded them."
5,Great live for all region,"I enjoyed this live a lot. Though I felt a little strange just after the beginning (probably mainly due to slow tempo of the songs), I found myself grooving as the show goes on!Note that this is NOT the region 1 only disc. All region is supported."
3,Nice but can't compare to the Central Park Concert,"There are some very nice moments in this concert DVD (Kathy's Song, the Everley Brothers sequence, Sounds of Silence, American Tune, Slip Sliding Away, etc.) and, especially now in 2008, one is reminded of how timeless (and timely) Paul Simon's lyrics are. However, this whole concert seemed overly staged and forced compared to the Central Park Concert. Central Park was a phenomenon; an amazing, one-time, convergence of time, place, atmosphere, attitude, spirit and incredible, incredibly beautiful music. If you want to get both DVD's, great, but if you want definitive video evidence of S&G's greatness, Central Park will always be the one."
2,Buyer Beware,"I bought this thinking I was getting a good product and great protection (warranty) for a fraction of the cost of the prices at the big box stores. The other day we had a lightening storm and my receiver got cooked. I reached out to Monster and found out there is a difference in purchased ON Amazon.com and purchased FROM Amazon.com. Amazon.com is an authorized Monster retailer, many/most of the retailers on here are not and there is no warranty coverage for purchases from non-authorized dealers. If you are looking for a decent surge protector but aren't concerned with having the warranty coverage this is an acceptable product, just be aware that depending on the actual retailer, you may not have that Monster warranty covering your electronics."
4,"Great music, weak vocals","This CD straddles the boundary between progressive and heavy metal.Like progressive, the music is energetic and diverse and inventive and unpredictable. The overall attack is metal: driving and relentless and confident.That's the music. Varied, inventive, interesting.But the vocals are weak. The lyrics are the most tepid of Christian cliches, but that's not the problem. The problem is the singer's voice, which is eminently forgettable. Forgettable and screechy.Fortunately, you can ignore the voice for the most part."
3,Needs work,"Akacia is a group with a lot of talent. Writing is progressive and very good. The problem is with the vocals. The vocals alone would rate 1 or 2 stars, and I'm being generous. With a good vocalist and better production they would get 5 stars. I just can't rate this CD that high with vocals that bad."
1,"Grr, 54 minute Film Duplicated in 6 HR EP Mode","I would have never expected this from a fairly major manufacturer (their Betty Boop box set is superb), but this 54 minute film was duplicated/manufactured in 6 hr EP mode; as such the picture is dreadful. Louise Brooks deserves better."
2,for loise brooks completists only,"i do believe this was louise brooks' last movie after returning to hollywood after making a few very good movies in europe(""lulu"" and ""pandora's box""). this movie was to have been her punishment for leaving hollywood. always a free spirit, she said ""so long"" to hollywood after this, fading into obscurity before rediscovery in the 1960's.i love old B westerns but ones like this were modern day is mixed with olden day is just to tough to take"
5,Great for the Task,"This is a great book for the task it takes on: building Adirondack chairs, and a few related items, including a small table and a Westport chair.Having built booth the Westport and Adirondack chairs, I found the book to do exactly what it says: a good step-by-step guide which offers all the information you need to build the furniture.I started with the Westport - which was the easier design, then made eight 'Dack chairs for around our place. I made a few minor changes to the plans to suit my own preferences, particularly the angle of the back and the width of the arms, but otherwise just followed the steps and ended up with strong, good-looking chairs which have now held up well for several years of heavy use."
2,Not lots of content,"This book includes very few ideas and they are mostly included in another book (building garden and patio furniture:Classic Designs, step-by-step Projects).in the end I think it is worth the price (less than 2 dollars, but the shipping was almost equal to the price."
4,"OK, but a little disappointment","The videos came swiftly, except one... it was about a week later than the rest. But that's ok. Everything was in good shape.I was disappointed in that I was looking for a couple of episodes in articular which I'd enjoyed in the past. But they were not there. I watched the the entire set twice looking for them, but to no avail. Then I researched information online and discovered that there are actually six seasons, not five.I believe it's a bit misleading. I understood that it was to be the entire set of all seasons... but now I have to get the sixth season separately??"
4,An early look at the artist,"This is an art book, softcover trade, 8.5""x11"", 32 pages, published by Pocket Books in 1983. Introduction by Boris Vallejo. Foreword by Theodore Sturgeon. This was published early in the career of Rowena Morrill. The book has some comments from the artist about her work and short bio (now 20 years out of date), but the main focus is on the art (most of which has appeared on fantasy/sf book covers). According to the back it features ""26 Full-Color Reproductions, Suitable for Framing""."
3,"Some great moments, some not so great.","An upbeat rockabilly album, with a few songs that should become classics: ""Dumas Walker,"" ""Walk Softly On This Heart of Mine,"" and others that are greatly underrated, possible underground anthems: ""Smooth."" The best song on the album is ""My Daddy Was a Milkman."""
5,The album that shook Nashville.,"This is the record that opened the doors for all country acts who did not adhere to the hat and aw shucks formula. Filled with one catchy tune after another the HeadHunters pay respect to the past while partying into the future. Made for next to nothing, the album has the energy and feel of an incredible live show. Buy this record for no other reason than you will never hear a better drummer on any recording than Fred Young. Among the best country records of the 90's."
2,Complex plot...lifeless characters.,"Ted Allbeury's second book ""Snowball"" tries to be a great spy novel, with a complex, intricate plot about a secret memo signed by the U.S and Canada's leaders in the darkest part of World War II(just before the Battle of Britain). Allbeury imagines the consequences of releasing such information, and he delves into the rivalries of the Soviet world as it existed back then. His characters, though are too one-dimensional. I felt I didn't know enough about Ted Anders as a person to cheer for him, or to feel for him. A lot of spies die in this story, which tells us that this is nothing like Ian Flemming."
3,It's pretty good but I only use a tenth of it.,"It's got some fun stuff to play but only about a tenth of it, It's definitely a beginner book but there are better out there."
3,What hath God wrought?,"When I was a kid I wanted a knife like this ""more than life."" It certainly made my Cub Scout knife look insignificant! I finally was able to buy it. It came, I saw it, I was conquered. But what do I do with it? It sits on my bookshelf and collects dust. What a shame I could not afford it when I was a kid."
5,A+,I have now had this knife for 5 years. I use it on a regular basis and it continues to function perfectly. I have had no problems with it. I would purchase again.
5,My Favourite Book Ever!!,"I read them all and this one is most exciting novel on the face of Earth! It is about Susanna Merritt's life during the war of 1812. Her father is the Sheriff of an army in Canada in Niagara, so she hardly ever sees her. With her father, brother and pregnant sister not living with her, Susanna only has her Mother, other sister Maria, and maid, Tabitha. One night, while in Niagara visiting, Susanna buckles on Governer Brock's sword before a very, very, very important battle, and if you read this novel, you will find out if the Canadians or Americans won this battle."
2,"Shallow, weak","A fairly shallow and not so well backed-up look at an underappreciated martial arts discipline. Many of the pictures depict half hearted versions of the techniques, and honestly no serious martial artist should attempt to learn any style from a book. I picked it up on a whim hoping it would focus more on history and philosophy than picture-based instruction.While not wholly terrible, I am not sure for whom this would be particularly beneficial."
1,One can always brag own horse,"I recently bought this book, and I must say emediately DON'T BUY IT ! Book has about 130 pages, and about half of these book is braging (hope that I used right word). It is possible that Sifu Lai Hung is real master, but this book is only moneymaker! There is only 40-50 pages of practical techniques, and very basic ones too. I would never recomend this book to anyone. There is much better boks like Shaolin Long fist etc."
5,Carol's Book Rocks!,"Carol Brazo writes in an intimate, lilting style. Her stories captivate and inform. Like a good teacher, she sets up a situation, gives you a look down the road, then connects the dots. Each chapter begins with a fictionalized narrative from the Bible, followed by current stories of real people, then she neatly ties the whole thing together with provoking questions and scripture references.This book packs a punch! And husband enjoys hearing me read it aloud to him."
5,The Final Cut,I am a Pink Floyd collector so I had to add this to my collection. I always buy brand new and still sealed. I'd say the songs on here are awesome.
1,wrong size to small,"This item states 54 on tag but it is really a 42 or 44. The pants might be a 32"". Either way it is to small and should a average junior high student. Do not buy."
4,nuts and bolts greek islands,"Primarily geared towards the independent low-budgeter, the book is packed with accurate, practical detail and covers more remote island villages than other similar books. Reads like an encyclopedia and thus compliments other books (eg. the Facaros/Cadogan book and this are a great combination) Better than Let's Go or Lonely Planet for solely islands travel. Doesn't have a very good Athens portion. I'd suggest getting the Facaros book first and then if a return trip or looking for more minute and/or remote detail get this to compliment."
4,"Very complete, yet concise","Before purchasing this book I reviewed a number of books on the Greek Islands at my local library and settled on this Rough Guide version as being the most up to date, the most complete, and the most readable and frank (looked at Insight, Lonely Planet, Fodors (Greece), and others). I am traveling to both Corfu and to Crete this year and feel that the treatment is at the appropriate level for my one week stay on each of those large islands and a one-week sail through the other Ionian islands. I will supplement this with a sailing book/charts on the Ionian Sea and a Michelin Green Guide of Greece which emphasizes the archaeological sites and history. The upside is that with one purchase I now have info on other Greek Islands for future travels in the Sporades, Cyclades, etc. I have successfully and happily used Rough Guides in the past for European regions such as Bretagne."
3,Big Disappointment,I was disappointed in this book. The dysfunctional characters were good but a lot of it was so implausible that I lost interest halfway through. The storyline with Edward was ridiculous. Not Ruth Rendell's best.
4,Great product!,I did some research before buying the cable for my Boston Acoustics XB6 Subwoofer. This product offers a superb response letting my subwoofer perform at its best (the way it is supposed to). I do not perceived a signal lost and certainly don't have any distorsion at all. My subwoofer is located at about 7 feet from my Yamaha receiver and in spite of the distance it delivers the tight bass and crisp sound so distinctive of Boston Acoustics subwoofers. The cable is very well made with strong beautiful looking connectors.
2,Over price,"Over priced, not worth the money I paid for it, I have a cheaper cable which I cannot tell the difference in performance....."
