1,"Girl, you are no Anne Shirley!","I too find this cover totally inappropriate.It reminds me of the 1995 movie version of Jane Austen's 'Persuasion'. At first they had this cover on the VHS box, of two people NOT in the movie.[...]It was changed for later editions. But I thought at the time they obviously considered Amanda Root and Ciaran Hind not 'sexy' enough to 'sell' it.This cover does not sell me this edition of one of my favourite books."
1,Cheap Ploy for money,"The cover is intended to sell the book, and has no relation to the content. Anne was a rather average looking girl with spirit and imagination, not a blonde in flannel, posing confidently. I'd recommend supporting one of the other books (of many) here on Amazon that doesn't try to misrepresent the book itself."
1,"Buy this book, but not THIS book!","Oh, how I love Anne Shirley. She and I have been ""kindred spirits"" for decades. Please do buy this book for the little girls in your life -- but don't buy THIS one. Whoever thought it appropriate to put Anne into an Abercrombie & Fitch, sexy farm girl shirt with let's-get-busy-in-the-hayloft eyes is insane. Anne is a 10-year-old redhead who blushes! This is really offensive."
1,Shockingly Offensive,"When I first saw this cover, I was hoping it was a terrible joke, and am appalled that it is not. As an avid Anne reader, I find it in extremely poor taste. The publisher should be ashamed of himself for tarnishing a beloved children's book with a cover that looks like trashy chicklit. Anne is a spunky orphaned Canadian girl from the early 1900's - not some sexy Kenny Chesney-loving farm vixen. I can't wait to find a copy of this ghastly edition at thrift store so I can burn it."
1,Used bookstores are the answer to that travesty of a cover!,"Go to your local used bookstore and find an old copy - you can share the wonderful stories without that abysmal cover! (Oh wait, maybe the marketing department thought they were reading Lolita)"
1,Anne is a redhead,"Anyone who has read and loved this book knows, Anne of Green Gables is a redhead. She was the heroine for all of us redheads who were called awful names growing up. This person is trying to make a quick buck. Don't buy this version."
1,Horrible cover! Great book!,"Anne is a ginger and unhappy about it. She is such an important character in YA (young adult) literature. She is adored because she is real--flawed & insecure but also stretching herself & daring to become her own woman. She struggles with social expectations and ideals. The beautiful girl on this edition is NOT Anne, does NOT look like Anne, and frankly looks too sexy to be associated with Anne. BOO PUBLISHER - HOORAY ANNE!"
1,What is wrong with this publisher?,"This is one of the best series of books for young girls. I discovered Anne at 10 years old and have loved her ever since. The whole point of the book is that she is not conventionally pretty and it forms the way she interacts with the world. It is an abomination to use a soft-core picture of a vapid blond on the cover.The books themselves are 5 stars, this edition - NONE."
1,disgusted!,the cover is disgusting and what a way to treat a beloved book!!!I would never buy this book! I have old copies and if buying an Anne bookfor a gift I would give this version a pass.......
1,"This is a joke, right?","The Anne books have been some of my favorite for as long as I can remember reading. I'm a redhead who had a character I could identify with, which was important when I was young. Try having your people read the book before creating a cover like this. Also, that woman is clearly not a preteen."
1,WTF Amazon?!?,They really need to crack down on this kind of copyright trolling. Everyone else has said what I want to say. Lets do our best to tie this thing a negative star rating!
1,Are you kidding me?,"Wow, this is really low. What happened to the beautiful, innocent little red-haired girl? Did they change the line ""Carrots, Carrots"" too? This publisher has really sold out on beauty being only on the outside rather than coming from the inside...something that the original Anne of Green Gables really illustrates. I love this book, love this story...but this book cover has got to go."
1,Would never buy this edition!,"What idiot is responsible for the cover on this edition?! It misrepresents not only the look, age, and character of Anne, but the time period as well! What next, are they going to put a playboy bunny on the cover of Peter Rabbit? I'd never buy this edition."
1,"Maybe they should have, y'know, read the book...","Great stories. Wonderful stories. It's a shame that they substituted the cover for ""Sweet Valley High - A Summer at the Farm"" instead of something REMOTELY about the book.The series is set in the mid-to-late 1800s - so the clothing is off by about a century. Plus, duh, the part about her being a REDHEAD.Buy a different edition. Or a copy of the mini-series with Megan Follows and Colleen Dewhirst. But not this. Please. Or it'll be the Weasleys next..."
1,Did the artist even read the book?,"I can't believe the artist or designer for this photo read the book, because if they had they would have realized that not only is she red-headed and freckled and prepubescent as previous people have pointed out, but also that her personality would not have her tossing her hair like a Clairol commercial and staring seductively into the camera. I suggest this version gets recalled, and if they find it necessary to create a new version that the designers take a model approach and read the books and then get inspired by the brilliant writing and take the appropriate shot that I am sure they are capable of...come on I believe in you! You can do it!"
1,Seriously bad cover,"This cover is horrible. Buy Anne of Green Gables, but don't buy this edition. Anne was not a sexy girl, she was not blonde, she did not wear plaid button up shirts. Anne was a young girl (about 10) with red hair (big part of the story) and wore dresses. Use your money to buy a different edition!"
1,Degrading and disgusting cover,Way to destroy and defile the classics. This cover is ridiculous and offensive. It ruins a great piece of literature.
1,ANNE WAS NOT A BLONDE ABERCROMBIE MODEL!,"This cover is 100 percent WRONG, WRONG, WRONG! Anne was a redheaded 12 year old girl with freckles, not a blonde porn star! DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION. RIDICULOUS! What an insulting cover."
1,Respect L.M. Montgomery,"This publisher doesn't deserve your money. Get this wonderful book (about an awkward, pre-adolescent, skinny, freckled red-head) for free at gutenberg dot org."
1,Anne was a slim redhead,So who is the sexed-up tart on the cover? Why is she dressed like she is The Farmer's Daughter waiting for the Traveling Salesman?
1,Who's The Loser That Came Up With The Idea For The New Cover?,"Obvioulsy, you have never read the books. Anne is a red-head. And a young, naive girl. Not a blond trampy valley girl. This cover is a total slap in the face to the high quality writing of Montgomery, and the character she created. Bad move Amazon! BAD!"
1,Anne of Green Gables,"The Anne of Green Gables stories are absolutely wonderful! But I will never buy this edition. The blonde seductress on the cover is NOT vivacious, spirited, red-headed Anne with an ""e"". Did the artist even read the book?"
1,morons who haven't read the book should not be in charge of marketing.,morons. sexualising a childrens book. the main characteristics of the character utterly disregarded. do not buy this version. don't let morons publish books.
1,Edition not accurate,"Please do not buy this edition of these beloved classics. The picture on the cover is not an accurate representation of the main character Anne.This is my all time favourite novel and series and helped me get through adolescence, this is a must read for any girl/young woman, but not this edition. This edition of these three novels does not convey the major themes of the novel in any way and does its best to alienate those who these novels would most relate to."
1,Horrendous and Upsetting Cover,"Did they really try to ""sex up"" Anne on this cover? Anne is an innocent red headed child who we all know and love. This cover is appalling."
1,Did these people READ this book?,I hope no one buys this edition....the absurd cover photo is abhorrent to anyone who loves this series and its heroine.
1,Money Grab,This book is just a money grab. By using a blond girl that looks nothing like the official image of Anne they would not have to pay the rights for her image and because the book is now so old its a free license. So this is just a giant money grab. Please at least buy an addition that pays for the rights to Anne's image.
1,Insulting,"The cover is an insult to the author, the story and Canadians. Please remove this travesty from your website. Disgusting."
1,Unlicensed garbage,"Total money grab by some turd who used Amazon's self-publishing CreateSpace to put unlicensed artwork onto this public domain work and sell it for personal profit. It goes against the entire spirit of the story, its author and her estate.Skip this counterfeit trash and buy one of the genuine versions instead."
1,In the Depths of Despair!,"""I can't eat. I'm in the depths of despair. Can you eat when you are in the depths of despair?"" How COULD anyone ever IMAGINE Anne Shirley with b-l-o-n-d-e hair?!...this cover is a false portrayal of our beloved red-headed Anne. The publisher of this cover is definitely NOT a kindred spirit!"
1,Don't buy this edition,"Someone who has obviously never read the series decided the book needed an update. So, HE (and, I'm assuming it's a male because no woman would have gone this route) decided to sex up little innocent Anne. First off, she's a little girl, secondly, she's A REDHEAD! That's a very important part of Anne's story. If HE had bothered to read the first chapter he would know exactly what Anne looks like. Thirdly, Anne would have never worn a shirt like the one the blond sex pot model is wearing. HE didn't even bother to find out what period the book takes place in. The person who decided to sex up a book for young girls should be fired from his job. DO NOT BUY THIS INSULTING COPY OF THIS BOOK. But, do buy the books. Only purchase them from a publisher who respects the books they publish."
1,"Wonderful books, TERRIBLE COVER!","Anne Shirley is very special, and deserved to be honored and protected. This cover is an insult to her character, and to all the girls who ever loved her and saw themselves in her.It seems these books are out of copyright, and someone has slapped a stock photo cover on and offered them for sale. What, they couldn't even be bothered to find a stock photo of a REDHEAD?? Obviously, it is someone who doesn't know about or care anything for the books, and thus does not deserve our money!Choose another publisher, until this one removes that anti-Anne abomination from the cover!"
1,Great series - horrible cover on this set.,"Anne of Green Gables had RED hair and was incredibly plain looking at the beginning of the series. Not a buxom, blonde, sultry teen! Blasphemy!"
5,This is NOT the new 3-in-1 set,"Somehow the reviews for the new 3-in-1 set with the sexy blonde on the cover are being applied to this older boxed set of three books. As far as I can tell, the covers of these books are very appropriate drawings. The content, of course, is wonderful. Hopefully the earlier printings will remain available so readers can buy books where the cover character looks like Anne, not a contemporary teen movie actress."
1,What the...?,This book is supposed to be Anne Of Green Gables NOT Anne Does Green Gables! What is wrong with this publisher?
1,Worst Cover Ever,"Really, who is that girl? Definitely not Anne! The books are wonderful and do not deserve this disgrace of a cover. There are so many more copies out there with beautiful covers that actually have something to do with the novel. Do yourself a favor and buy one of them instead."
1,Blonde sultry Anne?!?,"I have read all of the 8 boxed set of the Anne of Green Gables series. I love the series and as a little red headed girl, I imagined myself to be her. I am appalled that they would put a blonde haired woman in a sultry pose on the cover, this is not Anne of Green Gables. The original series with the adventurous, not at all sexy Anne of Green Gables on the cover is still sold online, in book stores, and at your local library. If you are going to buy this set for your little girl, buy the original, not the one that tells impressionable young girls that they need to be blonde and sultry.The Complete Anne of Green Gables Boxed Set (Anne of Green Gables, Anne of Avonlea, Anne of the Island, Anne of Windy Poplars, Anne's House of Dreams, ... Rainbow Valley, Rilla of Ingleside)"
1,BOOK COVER IS A TRAVESTY,"First, I absolutely love the Anne of Green Gable series. I loved the movies, the television show ""Avonlea"", and all of the writing by L.M. Montgomery. That's why I am absolutely HORRIFIED by this new cover. I go back to read these books to get back to a simpler time; i.e., before teen girls were so objectified, among many other reasons. These books take place at the turn of the century, meaning modesty is very important, hair is always pulled back, and anyone using make up was looked at askew. What the hell were they thinking with this very sexy teenage girl?? She in NO WAY personifies what Anne is about - and the fact that Anne has red hair is only a very small reason why there is so much wrong with this cover.If Anne had showed up at Green Gables looking like this, Marilla would have thrown her out with the bath water, and none of the rest of the series would have been written. What is the publisher THINKING??"
1,How dare you!,"First off, this is published by CreateSpace, which means that someone has reformatted the books, and is now selling them as their own. While they may be past copyright protection, I find that appalling. I won't even dignify that hideous cover. Whomever is selling this should be ashamed."
1,ANNE HAS RED HAIR,"Love the books, but this cover drives me mad because ANNE HAS RED HAIR IT'S A THING. Going to return it for a book with a proper cover."
1,Does the Publisher Know the Books???,"No Anne lover should buy this set of books simply because the cover is awful. I would love a newly published set to give to my daughter, but I won't buy this. I would rather her read my old ones."
1,Terrible edition,"Wonderful books to buy from another publisher. Please do not support the publisher of this dreck. Let Anne be the sweet, feisty, red haired little girl she should be. Appallingly lazy and careless publication."
1,What's next...Pippi Longstocking in a bikini?,"My favorite books as a child were the entire Anne of Green Gables series. This cover art is insulting, and I am actively discouraging friends from buying it. Publisher, I advise you to quickly fire whomever it is that came up with such a cover design (just guessing here, but could it have been a man?). For crying out loud!"
1,unacceptable!,"This cover is unacceptable and completely in defiance of the spirit of the Anne of Green Gables stories, not to mention totally inaccurate. Do not buy this book and contribute to the destruction of Canadian literary favorite. Buy a version from a bona fide publisher."
1,Ms. Montgomery is spinning in her grave!,"Lucy Maud Montgomery went to war with a publisher when they got the moon wrong on Emily of New Moon. Imagine how she would feel about this cover! Anne is a scrawny little red head, not a buxom blond looking for action. This is a disgrace."
1,Highly Offensive,I am shocked that someone would put this picture on a beloved classic book. It represents nothing to do with the book and I hope people do not put money into the pockets of this publisher.
1,Really?,"This is why I hate when things become public domain -- any jerk with a computer can self-publish someone else's public works and make money off of them. With a hilariously, horrifyingly inaccurate cover. Anne Shirley was not, by any stretch of the imagination, a sexy blonde farmgirl with a come-hither stare. Really, I hope Amazon pulls this from its virtual shelves.What an embarrassment."
1,Anne is a red head!,"Honestly, this outrages me a little bit. Anne is a young girl in the beginning of the series, definitely not a sexed up 17 year old. Also, SHE HAS RED HAIR. This is one of the primary character traits of Anne, and fuels several major plot lines. These books are wonderful, but the publisher really messed up with the cover art."
1,Terrible cover,"This cover is wrong for the book on at least three levels: age and description of main character, the plot of the book, and the philosophy of the writer. The publishers fundamentally don't understand either this book, the intended audience, or the people who buy this book for the intended audience. Don't reward those who wish to sexualize females of every age and who hate the story they are trying to make money from."
1,"Books are Awesome, Cover is Awful","I've long been an Anne Shirley fan and I find this cover offensive, misleading and a complete joke. It doesn't represent anyone or anything in the book and gives an entirely false idea of what the book is about. Surely kids these days don't need to be lured into reading a book by a cover that borders on salacious and is ridiculous. If they think the book is about Anne casting alluring glances at Gilbert they'll only be disappointed. There must be lots of other great editions of this book one can buy - I'd recommend any of them over this one."
1,No Stars Horrible!!!!,This is a Canadian disgrace!!! This girl is not Anne of Green Gables!!! I am in shock and may never shop Amazon again for this reason. To change the face of a literary heroin like Anne to a commercialized sexualized child is not in keeping with any respect for literiture or the culture of Canadians. This is a terrible message to young people and the human race. I really can't believe this. Have some respect Amazon! Take this book off and show you care about the message you are sending.
2,Blond on Front Cover of Canadian Classic,"This is one of my favourite stories that I cherished as a young person. I would like to purchase a box set of the books for my niece so she can share the same bit of Canadian history that I did when I was young.I understand that you might be trying to encourage readers by using a more modern book cover, however, I am pretty sure the buyers of this box set are people like me - who already love the story and want to see it passed on. Having said that, having a busty blond on the cover in no way reflects the nature of this story. A lot of the premise of this story is around Anne's red hair and gawky-ness. This girl does not look gawky and nor does she have red hair. I mean..her nick-name is ""Carrots"".Anyway, I wanted to just add to the comments in this regard.Thanks"
2,dont judge a book...but ....two for story none for image,"Some covers are misleading. Buy the ones that match the story inside..public domain may grant liberties but don't mess with peoples memories AND the first most recognizable thing about the primary character by putting some version of a Pie on the cover. The books and story are amazing but don't mess with the image of our beloved Anne Girl. I own the box set with ""carrots"" Anne in paintings on each cover. They are a little treasure I got here on Amazon."
1,wrong!,"Wrong hair color, wrong era for clothing, wrong model,wrong message to young girls. What a ridiculous thing to do...were the publishers trying to use the ""sex sells"" approach to entice 10 year old girls to buy them? Even if it was an oversight...how shoddy and unprofessional."
1,If you can't get the cover right...,"Since the publisher got the cover so wrong and obviously did not even read the novels, how can you be confident that the text is complete and accurate?"
1,"Hey, Publisher? READ THE BOOKS","It is clear that no one involved in this publishing company ever read these books. This brings publishing to a very low level indeed. Do not buy this edition of these classic and wonderful books - find something created in the spirit of the books. Anne is described as a red-haired ten year old. So who is this on the cover? The town teen floozy from down the road? It is bad enough that books today are spell-checked and not proof-read, but to not even have the details of the main character represented in the art work is sloppy publishing and should not be supported."
1,Offended by Cover.,"There is no need for me to go to lengthy review only to restate what others have stated in comment about the new cover of this book. It is horrible and beyond offensive for those of us who have actually read the book. I wanted to cast my vote and hope that our collective voices are seen by the publishers.Please, please do not purchase a copy of Anne of Green Gables with this cover."
1,"Books are great, but O.O","Seriously, at the very least Anne of Green Gables should be part of every middle school reading list, but is the 18-21 blonde on the cover supposed to be Anne Shirley? Last time I checked, and correct me if I'm wrong because it's been a while since I've read the books, isn't she supposed to be an 11 or 12 year old Redhead with freckles? Seriously publishers! A bad cover like this is going to get walloped on because: 1) Fans already have all the books 2) Those who've heard of the books and would be getting them for the first time are going to be turned off by the cover and 3) People judging the book by the cover will be disappointed about not hearing about the blonde they have on the cover. Really, Buy the books, JUST NOT THIS EDITION!!!"
1,Unnecessarily pathetic,"This cover is simply disgusting. Not only is the cover model a blonde, but she is styled to be revoltingly sexy for someone so young. Anne of Green Gables is a young woman who starts off incredibly awkward and grows up to be pretty, yes, but also to be a woman of spirit and character. The blonde on the cover? Well, I wish that young woman the best, but she certainly doesn't convey those attributes in the least. Shame on whoever created this cover, and I will never, ever, ever purchase this set for any young woman I know. In fact, I think I'll make a note of the publishing house in order to try to avoid purchasing their products as much as possible in the future."
1,Bycott this book get the REAL one ...,"Sorry but what the ..........Anne is a Red Head .. A RED HEAD .. not some trashy blonde ... What is up with the cover? Stick to the classic .. because do you seriously think putting this on the cover will sell it?Pathetic!SignTotally insulted Redhead.P.S The ONLY AND I MEAN ONLY reason it has a single star is because apparently my opinion of NO stars is not allowed and I am forced to give it at least one, Should have a thumbs down selection instead."
1,New Anne of Green Gables Cover?????????,"Actually, the new Anne of Green Gables cover isn't even worth one star. It is a disgusting attempt to turn modern girls onto a story that has lasted for many years, growing more loved with each year. Blonde? Anne was a Redhead. What, no freckles? Whoever designed this cover has obviously never read the books! The designer should be spat upon and beat to mulch with a book.....or maybe have their hair dyed green. I would not buy this book and I would not recommend it with this disgusting cover."
1,This is not Anne of Green Gables,"Anne of Green Gables is one of the most wonderful fictional characters ever created. She's red-headed, freckled and 11 years old! I don't know who this grown blond woman is with the come-hither pose, but what a great disservice to little girls everywhere."
1,Travesty of Green Gables,My four-year-old granddaughter can tell you that Anne is a RED head. Further Anne would not pose in a sultry or sexy manner such as this. Did the publisher actually APPROVE this cover? I would recommend obtaining a copy from a used book store before purchasing this edition.
1,"Who messed up? This is so, so wrong.","This is so wrong. Anne is a thin, gawky orphan with ""carroty"" hair, who grows up to be a fine, educated, young woman with auburn hair, who specifically works to resist objectification. Whoever approved this cover should be fired. I mean, how. How? HOW?"
1,Ugh. Seriously?!?! Horrible cover art. Ruins the whole book.,"Ugh. Seriously? A book's cover art can play a huge part in a teen's perception of the characters contained within. With that in mind, WHO IN THE WORLD could read Anne of Green Gables and picture her as a drop-dead gorgeous, buxom blonde?! Who was the genius responsible for this? I want kids to fall as in love with Anne as I did as a teen - but not because of her fantastic hair and hot bod. Unlike this cover model, Anne was a normal girl with freckles and orange hair. It was through her actions and the love of those around her that the reader was able to see her absolute beauty."
1,Buy a different version,Are you kidding? Anne is a ginger. Buy this book from a publisher that actually bothered to read the story.
1,Anne...blonde sexy farmgirl...exactly how I always pictured her.,"Strawberry blonde? Gives a new twist to the whole 'bosom' friends line. So glad this subtext has been artfully revealed in this cover. Also I hear there's an added, recently recovered chapter with her and Gilbert in the hay loft. I hear they have a spelling competition around certain Latin terms."
1,Do Not Purchase from this seller,"The Lucy Maud Montgomery books are classic and are worthy of being read.However, the cover has nothing to do with the plot, the characters, the setting of the period of time. It shows the reader that the publisher has never bothered to read the story or know the bare minimum about the main character, who is a red head.If you are going to purchase the set, and I highly recommend that you do, please look elsewhere."
1,Appalling.,"Who said okay to this cover? What is with sexy Anne?My biggest question is, did the publisher even read the books?Buy the book, it's fantastic. Just not from this publisher!"
1,great classic series TERRIBLE update to cover,"A blonde Anne, in a plaid button down making sexy eyes at the camera? who came up with that terrible idea? does not AT ALL represent the classic values of the book or the innocent whimsical main character!"
1,Horrible cover for the stories of my favorite heroine,"Of all issues concerning women girls and our power, THIS pisses me off to unexplainable amounts. Anne Shirley inspired me with her brains, wit, mischief, heroism and love for Gilbert. I never once thought about her sex appeal, or wished i looked like her, nor did Anne Shirley have her attention on this. What I do know is that I wanted to be as great as her. This was the genius of the Anne of Green Gables i know from public television. Major fail on the redesign and I feel like we just went about 40 years backward."
1,What in the world????,Since when is Anne of Green Gables a blond sexpot? This images disrespects the author's vision and is typical of the constant sexualization of girls we see in the our society today. Some things are sacred - Anne of Green Gables is one of them.
2,Anne of Green Gables 3-in-1 set,"The idea of a consolidated book of Anne titles is fantastic, however I take very strong issue with the cover of this book. As an Anne lover and a member of the publishing community, I am offended by the lack of planning and interest on the publisher's part in the content of the book they are trying to sell. Anne's most endearing quality is her childlike innocence, which maintains in some way or another throughout the series. With a series as ICONIC as the Anne, I would say this marketing strategy is a huge fail. I could not (and would not) recommend this particular version of Anne, though I would absolutely recommend the series to anyone who loves literature."
1,If i could give this zero stars i would,I have a 10 year old girl who is currently reading and enjoying this story. I would never ever ever be caught dead buying this edition though. Not only is the cover completely off base but also what kind of message does that cover give to our young girls. I am horrified to even see this.
1,Ummm... NO,"1) Anne is a redhead - this is a well known fact and an integral part of the story2) Anne is ELEVEN!!!!! The girl on the cover is at least 163) Anne's story was written over 100 years ago.. she'd not have been caught dead in flannel. Ever. (even if she did get it in her head to wear it, Marilla would never have allowed it)I get that it's just a picture, but really, I love Anne Shirley, and really don't appreciate her image portrayed as a generic blonde that's too old tobe Anne and wearing flannel. This is not acceptable."
1,"Excuuuse me, Anne has RED HAIR not blonde","The books are just wonderful. However, Anne is a shy awkward red-headwith freckles.The cover is just idiotic.What's next- a picture of Justin Bieber on a biography ofJackie Robinson?Dumb Dumb Dumb"
1,Blonde Anne? Seriously?,"Why would someone want this edition with a random blonde on the front? Anne at no time had blonde hair - green, yes - blonde, no. And I highly doubt she raided Matthew's closet to get tarted up in his work shirts. Did anyone at the publishers even bother to read the book or even watch the movie?"
1,Cover Travesty,"Don't be fooled by the five star reviews, they are almost all from an earlier edition (2001-2006). It's a wonderful series of stories, so please do buy a legitimate edition. Whoever okayed this cover . . .shame on you."
1,Blonde? No Way!,"Anne of Green Gables is one of the best books ever written. Anne Shirley is one of the most admirable characters ever seen in print. But this version horrifies me. Thankfully, it is now shown as no image available, but the image of the cover that was showed before is terrible. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to everyone, and have read it so many times I've lost count, but please please please think about the fact that the cover has no remote connection with the book. This book is so so so amazing and tells the story of one of my favorite characters (so much so I read all eight in the series more than once)and should not be misrepresented in such a way as this. Please read this series, but find a copy that has a cover that makes sense."
1,"Great book, offensive cover","Would you buy a copy of Roots or Uncle Tom's Cabin with a white guy on the cover? A key part of Anne's story is her challenge as an adolescent with her looks including her red hair and freckles. This 50 shades of Blonde cover shows a sexy blonde teenager way older than Anne. I would NEVER buy this edition on principle and find it insulting to Anne as a character, and to LM Montgomery's writing."
1,Cover image = Literary Heresy!,"Boycott this edition. The entire story is about a skinny, 10 year old orphan girl 'cursed' with bright red hair and prominent freckles. It's heartwarming, it's very Canadian, and it's very very VERY wrong to publish this edition with.... who is that? Some Yankee farm girl in her late teens?!I guess it just goes to say ""Never Buy a Book by its Cover"". This is not a lusty story of a precocious little tart having a 'roll in the hay' with a handsome farmhand. I'm hoping that the publisher simply misplaced the correct image. Maybe there's a book out there entitled ""Hay Loft Confessions"" with an inexplicable cover of an un-sexy (and decidedly underage) carrot-topped orphan girl from PEI at the turn of the century.BOO!Amazon should pressure the publisher to update the cover. As a BOOK SELLER it should be an embarrassment to sell Lucy Maud Montgomery's classic work of literature with such a ridiculous cover! For shame! :)"
1,Marketing is the devil,"As a child I loved these books. They were exciting but in a safe way and they really told a great story of a young girl finding a place where she is loved. However, that place was not in a pile of hay with farmer Jed. Let's stop the stupidity and actually make covers that work. It isn't like people haven't heard of the books before. I know you have to market to the weakest link, but I really don't think that someone who had never heard of the books would be happy with the story based on the cover. As someone who did like the books, I would be embarrassed to be seen reading this version in public. If you want to be lazy, just take a picture of a farm house or a field and put that on the cover. Don't hire some 30 year old actress to tart it up country style."
1,This cover is unacceptable! Avoid buying this book,"Ugh... this is awful. Anne is red-headed teenager, and would never pose like that. This photo is not what the book is about."
1,Anne wasn't an American Eagle model,"First, Anne of Green Gables was written circa 1908, so why does the cover ""art"" portray Anne in modern attire? Second, Anne is a redhead, not a blond. Third, why did the publisher deem it wise to mimic an an American Eagle advertisement? If nothing else, I'm pleased that my over-priced degree in English Literature allows me to recognize the ridiculousness of this cover. Buy a different edition, please."
1,Why is Ruby Gillis pictured when the book is about Anne?,"Dear Publishers:You made a mistake with the cover photo. The book is about a smart, sassy, intelligent, red headed girl named Anne who could also be a poster child for REI with all her wandering outdoors. The girl you have plastered on the front cover must be the boy-crazy, buxom blonde named Ruby Gillis. Sure, these two were friends but just to let you know, Ruby's only a minor character who eventually dies in the middle of the third book.Just thought I'd let you know."
1,Sexualization of a classic,"Please do not buy this. A red-headed freckled girl who grows up and learns much along the way. That is in no what what this cover SHOUTS. This book series is a classic, read and celebrated around the globe. It does not need a sexy model on the cover to sell it. Amazon please remove it from your store! Consumers buy this set instead: http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Avonlea-Poplars-Rainbow-Ingleside/dp/0553609416/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1360269748&sr=1-1&keywords=anne+of+green+gables+box+set"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION,"This is an amazing book, an amazing Canadian Icon. But this version is blasphemy, a blonde sex barbie is not Anne of Green Gables."
1,Leave Anne alone,"So wrong on so many levels. Anne is an Canadian icon and a classic. Don't mess with her, there are far too many classics being butchered all in the of making a fast buck.Changing Anne.....That would be like changing Steve Rogers into Stephanie Rogers and no backlash. But one wouldn't dare change Captain America, that would be blasphemous so what makes it right to change Anne?"
1,Oh look! Playboy has come to Prince Edward Island!,"So, when did sweet, wholesome Anne bleach her hair and become Miss August? Talk about not judging a book by its cover! What a travesty!"
1,Horrific cover art! Did anyone involved actually read the books?,The core and the soul of Anne is her red hair. And her freckles and her drab school dresses... this cover art is horrible. Let's put Brad Pitt on the cover of The Hunchback of Notre Dame...!
1,Worst cover ever,"Great books, with the worst cover ever. Buy any other edition! Whoever chose this obviously never read or loved these books."
1,Disappointed :(,"I literally just spent an hour reading the 1992 edition of this book and then happened upon this ""revised"" cover of the Anne of Green Gables series. I really can not express how disappointed I am with the choice of cover. If the publisher was wanting to gain a new reader audience for this series, I think they have succeded beyond they're wildest expectations.This series (books and films) are exceptional. I would love to see this cover replaced by something a little more fitting to what Anne actually is described as."
5,I cannot 1-star L.M. Montgomery. But that cover is the biggest fail ever.,"That cover is surely someone's idea of a bad joke. I hope so, because otherwise I must conclude that the cover ""artist"" has never read Anne of Green Gables or even HEARD of Anne of Green Gables and has no idea what on earth he has done.One thing I do know. He should be thoroughly ashamed of himself. Or herself, as the case may be.Anne's story is lovely. Charming, funny, touching, and so memorable. I haven't read it in years and yet I vividly remember so many scenes. The characters are fun and as relatable today as they were when the book was written. The setting descriptions will make you want to go live there. This is a novel boys can enjoy as easily as girls. Anne is one of the most real, most beautifully drawn characters ever created.That is why so many people are angry about this cover. And they have every right to be."
1,disgusting travesty of a cover,"This is taking revision Too far. Anne is a redhead, not a blonde sorority type. What the hey !This is an unnecessary and disgusting edition of this beloved series. It would be laughable if it wasn't so disturbing."
1,When Marketing Committees Design Book Covers,"This is a parody, right? What's next? Favio ripping off her bodice? This can't be serious... but I don't see any other authors, except the publisher, who's actually Amazon. What are you doing?"
1,"anne is a 10 year old child NOT a sex object, creepy much!",Do not give this publisher or Amazon any money for this edition. It's frankly rather creepy to use a sexualised older blonde instead of a red-headed child in the cover.
1,Who kidnapped Anne?,I love Anne of Green Gables and HATE this cover. This is not Anne. The woman on this cover looks more like a sleazy farm hand you'd want to keep away from your brother. But sex sells.
1,Seriously?,"The Anne books were always a favourite of mine, so to see them republished with this cover is just sad. It's a period book about a little red headed orphan - how exactly does this cover reflect even vaguely the actual contents? Talk about false advertising!I'll stick to the Gutenberg Project free versions, thanks."
2,Shameful,If this was the very last edition of this series ever published. If I was stranded on a desert island with this specific book series in this edition. If this would be the last picture or image that I would ever see linked to humanity. I would rip the cover off and burn it to keep myself warm. The other publications of this book are great. I cant wait to read them to my daughter. But I will NEVER pay money for this version. EVER.
1,Anne of Green Gables is not blond!,"Lucy Maud Montgomery's books are amazing, but PLEASE do not buy this version. Whoever has issued it has no idea who Anne is. First of all she is NOT blond, and furthermore, she is a young, innocent girl - not a young lady in a flannel shirt posing on a bale of hay with a 'come hither' look in her eyes. Anne would never have done that! I can't understand why this version is allowed to be available for sale. Clearly it is nothing to do with Lucy Maud Montgomery."
1,Another 1-star for the cover. I hope it's been corrected by now.,"Great book. A classic. Abominable cover. I hope it's been corrected. Just wanted to add another 1-star to the mix, to get the message to the publishers:)"
1,Please don't judge a book by it's cover.,Please don't judge a book by it's cover. This is not how L.M. Montgomery envisioned Anne Shirley. The book and it's collection is great. Whoever is responsible for this new cover clearly didn't do their homework. 5 minutes on wiki and you would've had your answer. Sex wasn't meant to sell these books!
1,Apparently the cover artist hasn't read the book?,"Apparently the cover artist hasn't read the book? Anne is a skinny redhead in a plain dress, not a buxom blonde in a man's shirt. Given that this is a young women in Canada in the early 20th century, this cover is completely inappropriate. The book has been adored for generations -- it does not need to be updated and Anne made sexier."
1,Ohhhhhh...Americans...,"Getting it all just sooooo incredibly wrong, ignorant and offensive again. Someone at this publisher so badly needs a brain-ectemy..."
1,"5 stars for content, minus 5 stars for cover","It is obvious that whoever designed and okayed the cover for this book has never read the series. Anne is a red-headed tween (at least in AoGG) from the beginning of the 20th century. She never was and never will be blond (heck, the one time she tried, her hair became green instead... even that would have been better on the cover!), nor would she wear such an outfit or strike such a ridiculous pose.I'm all for books being republished, but I hope this specific version will be pulled off the shelves quickly."
1,Why the blonde hair?,"Obviously, the designers have never read the original book. Do some research people! Is it so difficult to look up a summary of Wikipedia?"
1,Ridiculous!,"This is a fantastic first book in an amazing series. I've read them more times than I can count. But, this cover is totally ridiculous! You barely need to skim the first chapter to realize that Anne is ""decidedly"" red-headed, only 10 years old, and thin with a freckled face. Did they just grab a Hollywood ""beauty"" stock photo for this cover?"
4,Anne is Amazing,"I loved the Anne books. I loved the stories and how spunky Anne was. However, I found the cover on these books to be a desecration of the story. Anne was not a nubile blonde. She was a small skinny girl with red hair she wore in braids. This cover is ridiculous. It is false advertising and you should be ashamed of yourself for trying to make her something she was not. She didn't pose like a porn star. Anne and her author, Lucy Maude Montgomery would be horrified to see Anne displayed in this way."
5,Very Pleasant Classic,"I loved this and thought it is such a steal for only $1. I read the entire set and they make it so that all three books read like one book except the title page in between. The only downfall is I wanted the story to continue because it really draws the reader in. I don't think it is a book any men would really care for. It really is a story about a girl coming of age and becoming a woman. The story uses such elegant wording and is very, very well written."
3,Mixed feelings on the new cover,"Having read the book and watched the series I feel that the new cover does not suit the book and am saddened that in order for girls to read this book they have to put a sexy girl on the cover. However, as the foster mother of 3 girls ages 12, 13 and 16 I know how they pick books - by the cover! We go to the library and all the books they choose have similar pictures on their covers. I will pick out books and suggest they try them and they take one look at the covers and are not interested. Maybe with a cover like this some girls will actually read these wonderful books. I hope that they have not ""updated"" the story in the same way as the cover. I would suggest that the hair on the girl shown in the new cover be changed to red at the very least."
4,"A classic, understandably beloved by girls","I understand why this is a classic. However, it does demonstrate how fiction has improved since the early 1900s. I also understand why this series has been a great boon for the tourist business on Prince Edward Island."
4,As Promised,"I have an older Poulan (PPB300) weed eater, and I was not sure this attachment would work with it, but it hooked up and ran without a problem.I used it to trim the area I bought it for, which has some small plants and bushes in addition to grass, and it worked fine. I think that for larger (more than 1/4"") diameter branches & vines, you would be better off with a dedicated cutter, but for many jobs with requirements like mine, this attachment is just right - and a good value for the money."
3,not great,the blade was loose when i got it and when i tried to tighten it up part of the housing you insert a screwdriver in broke. if you need to tighten the blade i suggest you clamp it in a vice or something.
2,Weak Cutting Performance,This attachment is very weak at best. I tried it on several different areas and types of weeds but it just doesn't cut well.
2,"Not suitable for anything larger than about 1/4""","Not suitable for anything larger than about 1/4"", so if you want something to REALLY clear BRUSH that's larger than your finger, find something else."
3,A little disappointed,"The good:The attachment comes with shoulder strap and ""better"" handle.It only takes seconds to swap out and back in.The bad:The extra weight makes the unit vibrate significantly more, which quickly becomes tiresome.It doesn't seem to be that effective - I was expecting thick brush to be ""vaporized"", but the blade seems a bit dull, and the amount of effort required was surprising.As another review states - this item has limited use - weeds/shrubs around 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick, too thick for a trimmer but not thick enough to need a chainsaw/pruner attachment.Also, seems to get tangled up easier than the trimmer, but that might just be my inexperience using it...Overall then, not bad, just not quite the ""obliterator"" I was expecting.As usual, Amazon's delivery exceeded my expectations and their prices really cannot be bettered,"
3,Good but limited usage,"The brush cutter only works effectively if you use it at full speed and with a relatively fast movement to cut larger weeds. Don't expect to use it to do the same job as the trimmer, it won't cut smaller grass.The good thing is that this comes with a shoulder strap and an extra handle that really improve the handling of the machine (even for the trimmer). It is easy to switch to the trimmer but you might have to switch often if you have a mix of big weeds and smaller things to cut.I don't know if another blade would do better but the original blade does not seem very sharp. Protections are good and this remains a must have if you need to cut larger weeds that you can't cut with the trimmer."
4,Brush Cutter Attachment,"The attachment wasn't all that I expected. I had thought it woud trim small brush as easily as the string trimmer trims grass. It takes a little longer, but it does a good job."
3,Not great on bigger weeds,"This is a decent product when cutting smaller diameter weeds, and shrubs. However, when trying to cut larger sized weeds, and small trees, it does not have the power to do so."
4,Very Good,Hand a problem with the first one of these that I bought new. Returned it to Amazon and they backed the purchase completely. Amazon mailed me a new one and I returned the non working one. OUTSTANDING customer support by Amazon. I Received the new one in just a few days and it works very good. Completely satisfied! Thanks.
3,Brush Cutter Attachment,"I am not overly impressed with this item. It does reasonably well on small brush ( and i do mean small ) if you get too much over an inch its kind of like using a hack saw to cut a 4 x 4 decking post =) It will eventually get thru it but thank god for the extended handle and shoulder strap. The first one I got did not include the mounting bracket for the extended handle, however amazon was quick to pick it back up and send me a new one that was correctly packaged. If you have extra money lying around it is not a bad attachment to have, but keep in mind it is rather particular as to what it will cut easily. I have all the attachements now and the pruner is the best way to go if you have anything over an inch in diameter."
2,Will not cut small trees,This product works good for cutting stiff tall weeds. It is terrible for cutting and binds up on small trees. To remedy this I purchased the 8 inch round saw blade that is made for weed trimmers.
4,Sturdy,"This T-handle wasn't my first choice, but it is pretty sturdy for the price. I can give it a decent amount of torque before I see a little give from the stress of the turn. Will I buy another? Yes... if I had to, but I don't quite like the style of these T-handles. I prefer my T to have an additional hex on one of it's T ends for more versatile usage. For the price, this is an excellent buy."
4,Excellent reference source.,A very good source for a model railroader who needs specific information on a station on these branches. Timetables give you specific information for operating purposes. A worthwhile investment for reference purposes.
5,Middle Manager turns murderer,"Zane Smith has written a grimly humourous story of how any one can become a murderer. Circumstances escalate out of control for paunchy, out of shape Harry Carter and he thinks the solution all his problems will be to just murder the people out to wreck his daughter Jennifer's life...and his own.Mr. Smith takes us on a romping, stomping ride in this dark thriller. You will laugh, cringe and cheer for Harry despite his flaws. But you won't be able to put the book down till the last page is turned."
2,"Nice, but did not work on a Mac",Was able to use it on an old Windows PC but it will not install on a Mac as advertised. The seller took my word for it and refunded some of the money.It's very nice on the PC though.
2,not worth the money,"I thought this would be a cool thing to have on my mac but as soon as i got it i tried to install it and it didn't work. I was very upset. i couldn't get any of them to install properly, and i was disappointed. then i tried to install it on my pc and it STILL didn't install right. I'm not as upset as i would be if i had bought it retail price...instead someone online was selling it only for a few bucks. not worth the plastic case it's in..."
3,Squanto,I loved Gooney Bird Greene and so did my class of second graders. This one was less exciting. I had high hopes for it because we study Sqaunto. We will read it next year and I am sure we will learn to use our dictionaries like GB's class.
4,Gooney Bird and the Room Mother enjoyable,"As I began to read the front flap of the book it immediately aroused my curiosity. ""Who is the Room Mother?"" I think that students in the primary grades will relate to the character and will want to continue to read the rest of the series. Gooney Bird appears to be witty and funny. The book appears to be an enjoyable read."
3,shower gel,"we liked the other shower gel ..you used to carry in the black container ..was by paul sebastian also , but we were informed that you do not make it any more ...nicer and smoother.."
3,Did not warm to this production,I am afraid that I did not warm to this production but I admit that this is my first Nicholas Nicleby and I have not read the book - so perhaps I would not warm to the book either. Charles Dance is excellent at being nasty as he was in the recent superb BBC adaption of Bleak House.
2,Douglas McGrath Nicholas Nickleby is much Better,I was very disappointed with this production. I dont like it when someone takes a great classic novel and adds things in the production that is not there. It actually cheapens the novel.Do yourself a favour and buy Douglas McGrath - Nicholas Nickleby. It is far Better. You will not be disappointed with it.As for this DVD I will not be keeping it. It would have been an excellent Production if it was not for the added sences.
1,AHHHH!!,"Whoa! Now keep in mind, I have not read a single Dickens novel. I am however, familiar with the story of Nicholas Nickleby, as I have seen the 8 hour play on Laserdisc, and due to the length, it is pretty true to the book. But this version was torn to pieces. It completely left out some minor subplots, some major subplots, and a whole lot of other stuff. Don't bother seeing this one. A whole Dickens novel cannot be told in two parts. See the 8 hour ""The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby"" starring Roger Rees instead."
4,Good kids adventure book,"I read this book in I think 4th grade or so. That would have been the early 60's. Since I still remember the book at age48, it must have been good. An exciting mystery for a9-13 year old."
4,good info,"good info about various situations, great fun to watch. some extreme situations might not happen as described, but at least you have some insight ."
1,Blu-ray is not multi region?,"The Amazon description mentions A/B/C support, even the price tag like sticker that comes affixed to the cellophane packaging says A/B/C support. But the actual packaging and the disc itself has a B only on it. It does not playback on all three of my region A playback devices. There is a quick splash screen showing the program's logo after which the OSD's timer displays a --/-- and a blank screen. This remains no matter how long I leave it on, and playback does not start. It DID arrive with the disc dislodged from the holder, but as far as my eyes can tell, it wasn't scratched during shipment. Can't say I'm happy about this situation, I hope others have a better experience."
5,GRANTSTAND GRANT GREEN,The CD IS GREAT LOTS OF BLUES. THE WAY MR GREEN PLAY THE ONE NOTE IS MOSTLY GONE THESE DAYS AND IT'S A REAL TREAT THAT THIS GROUP GIVES THE LISTENER.
3,Elevating standardization,Enjoyable early 60's hard bop with a considerable amount of rawness injected from this particular lineup still usually walks the line between authentic and generic composition-wise.
3,"OK Book, Great Author","I love Rimmer, especially her Bravo books, but this wasn't one of her best.This is a contribution in the multi-author Montana Mavericks series. Each of the books stands alone, but you get the odd insert now and then - like the very last page of this one that has nothing to do with the rest of the story or characters. It's easy enough to disregard.The plot is a Category staple: hero out for revenge, heroine the innocent headed for heart break. That's never been a favorite of mine, and I found the first quarter a little slower, harder to get into than most of Rimmer's stuff. But I really liked the heroine's reaction to the Great Revelation.If you are already a fan, you'll like the book. If you are new to this author, try another first to really appreciate her. There are currently 31 books (31!) in the various Family Bravo series and they are all good. And then you WILL be a fan, and will end up buying this book anyway!"
5,Beautiful!,"Great condition, amazing pictures & very informative. It was more that I expected in regards to the illustrations. I do victorian scrapbooking ,probably I'm going to get a second one to use it on my albums."
5,Fits perfect. Easy install.,"This was an easy install in my Honda Accord EX 2001. When screwing in the bottom screws, use tissue or some other thing to stuff under the screw area to prevent the screws from falling into/under the unit in case you drop the screw."
3,Didn't Need It,"I have a '98 Honda Accord and I thought I needed this kit, but fortunately my receiver fit in the original frame."
3,"Eh, did the job.","For what was purchased, I think the price could be lower. In reality it's a few pieces of VERY cheap plastic which I felt was gonna break every time I handled it. But it did do the job and is secure with a decent look and the pocket makes for a little bit of extra space. I guess I would say I was a little more satisfied than dissatisfied with the product. I'm also pretty sure you could find the same at auto zone or walmart for the same or cheaper price, might even be a little better quality."
5,Honda Accord 2002,This dash kit was PERFECT for my 2002 Honda Accord. SE ! Absolutely no modifications necessary and it makes it look like it's a factory double din head unit! Thanks!!
1,Doesn't hold securely,"BEWARE!!Like others reviewers have pointed out, this piece needs a rear support which is not included. Without the rear support, the stereo is not going to stay in place securely. Just look at the picture and think - what's supporting the bulk of stereo's body? Nothing!You need something like thisMetra 95-7895 Double DIN Installation Dash Kit for 1998-2002 Honda AccordorHonda Radio Install Kitthat can support your stereo fully.I bought this and waited too long to let the return window expire. I just have to suck it and buy one of the others. :("
1,Waste of $,"Dunno what this is supposed to fit, but it sure doesn't fit the DiMarzio DPDT Mini Switch. The fact that it's listed with the DiMarzio switches might lead one to believe that it's designed to fit them, but apparently not. Even if it fit this switch, it's still about 10x more expensive than it ought to be."
5,manuka is!,"after doing much research online, have made a commitment on buying only manuka lozenges, as compared to regularsugary brand named lozenges that only sugar coat your throat. have invested in these quality lozenges for over 3 years now. made sure my daughter was protected as best as could be/ being away for college. have never made the change since. manuka is, and will always be..... our favorite."
4,liked it,its good for small med trim compressorquieter than mostpumps fast enough for 2 trim guysthe 150 psi really helps for air it takes to 53 sec reach 15013 sec to rechargeonly rated for 500 hrs
3,Good for a while,"I got this as part of a package with a couple nailers and fittings. It seemed to be a pretty good compressor, and I ran it frequently for various projects. With a little patience for cycle time, it can handle a framing nailer as easily as a finish nailer. I used it to build a small shed, refinish a bathroom, top off tires, and pretty much everything else one would expect from a smaller compressor.Unfortunately, it's now about three months out of warranty, and the pressure switch has conked out. It still runs and compresses just fine - right up to 160psi, when the safety poppet lets go and dumps the tank.I can buy something with similar specs at a big-box home store (dewalt 55120) for under a hundred bucks - so why would I spend twice that on another un-fixable compressor?"
2,"Best Design, Poor Build","By far, the best design in a portable compressor - low profile, not top heavy, lightweight, easy to carry with one hand, as in doesn't jab you while carrying, and easy to access all controls, and has convenient cord storage.The problems with poor build are well documented, this compressor won't last long for it's INTENDED use. Mine quit after a year and a half of medium use - if it had lasted 5 years, I probably wouldn't have thought a lot about it, and bought another one.I won't buy another Dewalt compressor, I only wish other companies would copy this body design, I can't imagine a justification for their more top heavy, awkward designs."
2,was great till it wasn't.,"I don't user this a ton, I'm just a home owner that uses a compressor around the house, to do things like nailing trim or filling up car tires. This thing worked great, right up to the point were it started leaking air from the motor housing. There doesn't seem to be any easy way to fix this other then sending it for repair or buying a new one."
1,Not for professional use,This compessor was very quite and worked well for about 13 months then the motor started smoking. When I took it in for repair the cost was going to be almost as much as a new unit. Needless to say it sits in my shop collecting dust.
1,Useless,After one year of very occasional use the compressor leaked and the motor started smoking. I took it to the local repair agent and they were useless. It now sits in my workshop collecting dust. Never again.
5,Only seen Happy Gilmore so far,"Happy Gilmore is an awesome, laugh out loud movie, and I have seen Patch Adams, and remember it being a great movie, so for the price offered you're getting two good movies"
4,Excellent Cart,"This is an excellent cart. It is well made and was reasonably easy to assemble (although I did have to undo and redo a couple of steps, as the instructions could have been clearer). The metal frame and wheels both appear to be quite durable. My only complaint is that the handle could be a bit taller, which would make it easier to wheel the cart."
1,Not too good,"I got it to transport trash cans to the trash collection place we have here, but after I assembled it, and put the trash cans in it, it kept falling apart. So I returned it. I may have got a ""lemon"" or not, but it just didn't work for me."
2,GC200 Garbage can caddy,"Was missing some parts, it comes apart when hauling garbage cans to the street. I would not buy thisagain."
2,stunk,"It fell apart after a week. It was easy to build and served it's purpose but it will fall apart. If you buy this invest in locktite, and maybe duct tape. It won't look pretty but it'll do the job."
4,Good Product,"As mentioned elsewhere it came without washers, so I bought some and also bought nuts with nylon inserts so they will not come loose. It is sturdy and the wheels role easily and it has handled some heavy loads over a very bumpy driveway. Two (2) Rubbermaid Brute 32 gallon Round #2632 trash cans fit perfectly."
2,Belongs IN the garbage,"You get what you pay for. It's functional, but thin gauge steel and uses cheap parts to hold it together. If you're looking for the most basic possible cart that functions but is always on the verge of falling apart, this is the one for you. If you're looking for something that just works well and is designed to make life easy for you, look elsewhere.The unit will stay together if you torque the screws very tight, but there are no stabilizers or cross bracing on the unit, so if you have to make any turns or have to go over any bumps the frame will rack on you. The handle should stick out forward away from the body instead of simply rising up higher than the frame. Two reasons: 1) your feet will bump into this thing when you pull or push it, you're too close to the unit and 2) you get less leverage the way it's designed."
1,Garbage Can Caddy,"I found the caddy easy to assemble, but the axel was missing for the wheeles.I found it easier to go to a local hardware and buy some solid bar stock and make the axel than go through the process of getting it replaced with the seller.The packageing was not tore open so the part could fall out during transit.No, I would not purchase again knowing what I do now."
4,Great for the money,"I bought two of these to carry my trash barrels to the curb and I can fit 2 big barrels in each cart. They carry alot of weight, they travel nicely, and I have had them for a year and they still work like new. The only problems that I have is that I have to put the side bars nback on every few weeks if I overload them. The directions were a little confusing and you have to be careful because the metal edges are sharp and they cut deep if you not careful!"
3,The Cell Games Begin!!!!!,"This vhs contains 3 episodes:Episode 160:The Games Begin:As the games begin, the entire team of Z Warriors [Minus Chouzou],arrive at Cell`s ring, in order to start the tournement. But it seems that one warrior is going to be first out:The Martial Arts World Champion [And total nutcase], Hercule!!!!!!!!!!!!Episode 161:Losers Fight First:Losers Fight First. Thats the first rule in the Cell Games! As two pupils of Hercule, and the amazing nutcase himself steps up to the ring, the ring is set for a hilarious battle!!!!Episode 162:Goku Vs. Cell: As Hercule finishes his act, Goku steps up to the ring to fight Cell! Does one of the first Super Sayins stand a chance aganist the third and final stage of the dark android?"
3,Cell games dvd,"I have seen the whole cell games saga before and this is by far a saga that many dbz fans and collectors should buy. The episodes on this dvd start the beginning of the cell games. The first two episodes on this disk show the world champion, mr. satan fight cell along with his pupils who are quite strange. This is a pretty good dvd if you are trying to buy the whole cell games saga. this is one of those dbz dvds that does not have much action, but it has some comedy in it."
3,The Cell Games are Finally Under way!,In this DVD you won't be able to see the REAL fight begin until the last episode on the disk. The other two episodes has Hercule Satan and his students going against cell. But the consolation matches (the ones before goku) are a better comedy than action.
1,Where is the Pas de deux?,"I bought this DVD of Tchaikovsky's Nucracker because of its beautiful score and Nureyev's reputation. I was really looking forward to the great climax of the pas de deux, I cannot believe that anybody would think of removing this important number.Save your money for a better production.Very, very disappointed."
4,Easy to setup and use,"I bought this to use for an extra hard drive I used on my old laptop. It works great for what I need - a backup drive. USB 2.0 is fast.Two warnings1. You need to use the cable that comes with it (or one of similar specs), or the drive won't work properly. I tried using a USB 2.0 cable I bought for syncing my cell phone and it didn't work with this case) Also, you need enough power on your USB ports (your computer will warn you if this is being overloaded).2. This is not compatible with newer hard drives. I tried to connect my 7200 rpm hitachi drive to it, and the connectors are different.Overall, I'm glad I bought this."
2,Repeatedly encounter data corruption,I've had to run chkdsk on the drives I use with this enclosure to recover data several times.
4,"Do it! Take that ""one step beyond""","At long last, someone is releasing episodes of this classic show on DVD. More eerie than ""Twilight Zone,"" this first release includes 12 episodes from the second and third seasons. (VCI promises more episodes are on the way.) The prints used in this first set are pretty good, and it's a treat to see the full 25- to 26-minute versions instead of the butchered ones that aired on the Sci-Fi Channel a few years ago. Some of these shows even have the original ""Alcoa Presents"" opening & closing titles. If you're a fan of ""One Step Beyond,"" buy this set and hope that VCI releases all 96 episodes!"
4,NOT the complete 1st season,"As another reviewer pointed out, there are missing episodes & some footage. The episodes ""Jet Bike"" & ""Biketober"" are not included. If you want these, prepare to shell out more $$$ + s/h from discoverychannel. com to get them."
4,Good show good value,"Big fan of the series. I actually run on the fire dept. with a guy that met them at one of the bike weeks in Myrtle Beach. Only complaint is the Jet Bike episode is missing (it wasn't that good anyway thanks to the stupid narrator) so I don't consider it a ""complete"" first season otherwise still worth the money."
3,KEEEEP BUILDING,"I really like this show. And since I didn't start watching it untill the middle of the third season, I bought the DVD. However, upon consideration. I may buy all of the seasons offered since shows made for the Discovery Channel are unlikely to show up in syndicaton on some other network."
4,"Good Book, but Lacks Further Injury Info","I've spoken with many other guys in my gym and on internet newsgroups who have rotator injuries. A good number of them, like me, have further injured their rotators by sleeping on their stomach, with an arm extended over their head, putting pressure on their rotators while (we) sleep. Horrigan makes no reference to sleeping positions and possible solutions in his book on rotator injuries. Perhaps this would be a good topic to be added to his next release. Doug Delorge"
4,7 minute Rotator cuff solution,"A useful book, simply written . Suggests basic problems which may occur with shoulders and suggests exercises/illustrated which may help prevent or improve function. I feel this book most useful in accompaniment with medical plan - since nerve impingement and more serious problems , obviously will not rectified."
5,Save your Delts!!,"This book has literally saved me thousands from un-necessary shoulder arthroscopic surgery. I read the book, did the rehab exercises, and more importantly QUIT doing the exercises that were CAUSING MY SHOULDER problems! This book was a lifesaver and a great deal for the price...Easy to read, well written and fully illustrated. Has plenty of tables and descriptions of the routines for Rehab, Strengthening and Building up the shoulder girdle. I used the exercises to build up my rear delts and have been pain free for years - this is after I couldn't even SLEEP, due to the pain in my R/C!! I even shared it with (2) other friends who had the same types of shoulder impingement pain, and they reported the same 'miracle' results (although I had to force my last friend to give me the book back, as he liked it so much...). Highly recommend this to anyone who suffers from shoulder pain, before they do any invasive techniques-it may save you like it did me!"
2,A nice book for those who need a little extra,This is a nice book for those who are seeking to help find themselves in today's society.
4,Why are these together?,"We hardly ever use the ramp tracks. But the bumpers are a ""necessity"" to put on the end or your sidings (parking spots!).So, in the end I think we paid $7 or $8 for a couple of bumpers... which, even relative to other expensive Brio items, seems high.A box of 4 bumpers would make much more sense (for us anyway)."
2,Just a pretty face...,"...not much more...for us, at least. we were so excited by the idea of this product and the orange/burgandy colors! but when it come down to it, we just couldn't ever adjust it comfortably enough for ourselves or the baby. we used and liked a hand-me-down baby bjorn and ""breast friend"" sling much better. sigh, such a waste of a pretty sling. ;-)"
1,Uncomfortable,"I found this sling was not only uncomfortable for me, but for my son too; particularly the drawstring on the bottom cut into his legs no matter how I adjusted it, or how I positioned him in it. Great idea, poor design."
2,OUCH!!,"I do not own this item but I tried it out in the store and it HURT my shoulder!!! The shoulder strap is too narrow, it digs in, and I only had it on for a couple seconds. I went with a New Native pouch and I LOVE it!!!!"
3,Stylish but not fabulous,"After having our first baby my husband and I realized how helpful it is to have a sling to carry your baby around with you when he needs to be close to you.We reviewed a bunch of different slings to find out what worked best. We found that a simple sling like this works great. Your baby can sleep in it or look out at the world while he is in it. This sling was so stylish-it looked just like the bags we see around Boulder, but it was not as comfortable with all the odds and ends added to it.We found a simple pouch style sling that ended up working great and we are able to use it with your toddler nephew too! I am not sure we would have been able to with this one.Overall, it is a good sling, but there are way better slings out there in more beautiful fabrics."
2,Did NOT like it at all,"This sling was VERY difficult to use I could never get it adjusted correctly and never figured out how to breastfeed in it without being obvious. I used this sling for about 6 weeks and it just about killed my shoulder and back. It was uncomfortable and not nearly enough padding in the shoulders. Plus you still had to carry a diaper bag and/or purse so that just added extra weight. Don't waste the money I would much rather have another front/back carrier they work so much better and are easier to use and feel a LOT safer.The only things I did like were the pockets on the strap to keep small things in like paci's, keys, money and cell."
3,Not perfect for tall folks either.,"I've been reading the other reviews and would like to add that this sling is clumsy, even if you are tall. I'm 5'11 and was given this carrier as a gift. It's basically a shapeless sack with padding and my baby was forced into a very strange position when he was first born. Comfortably scrunched up, his face kept being pushed into the side of the carrier with every movement I made. I was worried he would choke on the fabric. He is now two months and the fit has definitely improved for him. It is, however, very easy for your baby to overheat in this carrier. All in all, not a bad product, but I've seen better."
4,OK,"Not great to lay your infant inside, but ok if you leave it closed and slide it under baby for extra support. You can't let go of your baby this way, but it works great when your baby has already fallen asleep and you need something to support their weight.If you are carrying your child on your hip, you could slip it under their heiny to support their weight.It's a quick fix for tired arms but, it doesn't free you up completely."
4,A lifesaver!,My infant daughter loves to be held which is hard to do with her two year old brother wanting equal time. This sling has helped so much. And it's the same one that Dr. Bailey on Grey's Anatomy uses (except she wears hers upside down - don't know if that is intentional or not --hmmm...)
3,"Good quality, but needs some design work...","I ordered this before reading the reviews, or else I may have made a different choice. The materials and workmanship are great, which I would expect for the price. I am short (5'2"") and did manage to get it to fit me comfortably, using both clips, although it does seem a little excessive to have the strap cinched all the way. I have an infant who can't hold his head up quite yet, and I have managed to get him in comfortably and support his head adequately, but not the way the instructions said to do it. The design could be a little more conducive for supporting smaller babies, which is why I wanted to use a sling in the first place (I felt the carriers like Baby Bjorn are for use later, when the legs/hips are more developed, not for tiny babies/preemies who still have ""frog feet""). I use it okay, but wouldn't highly recommend it."
2,Hard to figure out!,"I was excited when my husband brought it home since I had read some good reviews, however after placing my son in it his chin was on his chest and not comfortable for him at all. Also the material was in his face. I followed directions and thought I had it right, mabye they should send out someone to show me how it works. I gave it a 2 since it is stylish & I hope it works in a few weeks when my son can hold his head up and he can sit in it...we'll see. Wish I had saved my receipt!"
1,Shoulder strap too narrow- it hurts,"I liked this sling because of the pockets, and it looks cool, BUT it hurts if you wear it for more than a few minutes. I also have a new native baby sling which is fabulous, and never hurts because the part that goes over your shoulder is wide.DON'T BUY IT. DON'T REGISTER FOR IT. Go New Native."
3,Negatives outweigh the positives,"I was very excited to get this sling. I love that most people don't realize I'm holding a baby when wearing it -- this makes nursing even more discreet than in a normal sling as you don't draw attention from people wanting to see the baby. The outside zipper pockets are great for keys, cell, wallet, etc., and the style is great (it looks more like a messenger bag until you're close up) & I've recieved lots of complements. My 2 mo. old dd is very comfortable sitting in it.That said, I would not buy it again. My daughter hated it as a newborn & would immediately scream if I put her in. The drawcord needs to be knotted to avoid danger of strangulation (very unsafe, not to mention inconvenient for adjusting). The sling is uncomfortably narrow at the shoulder & doesn't distribute weight well."
2,So cute but didn't work for me,"This is, by far, the best-looking sling out there. Too bad it didn't work for me, as I am 5 feet tall and could not adjust it enough to feel comfortable. My son was already 23 lbs. when I got this and the Parenting Concepts Sling Ezee had been tearing up my shoulder. We tried the Premaxx sling, and he rode more on my thigh than on my hip and I couldn't adjust it any further.Now we're off to try the Playtex Deluxe Hip Hammock."
2,Was great in the beginning,"I bought this when my son was 3 weeks old i used it all the time. was great in the beginning, but sometimes had a hard time getting him comfortable in it. He is now 9 months old and i really don't like it now. He is 22lbs and it is very uncomfortable for me to wear. i also feel like he is going to fall out if his arms are above the sling and he almost did the other day. i am 5'9"" and my husband is 6'5"" and i can't seem to get it to fit like he can. Wish i would have shopped around."
2,Uncomfortable!,"I wore this sling for about 20minutes and had to take itoff because it was killing my shoulder and my daughter was only 9lbs at the time. I ended up returning this sling and getting the NoJo, which I find is much more comfy."
3,Not meant for short people!!!,This is a great product if you are 5ft 6in or taller or if your baby likes to be kind of crunched it a very snugg fit 4 the baby!
1,not the greatest,I bought this sling and was not impressed with it. I didn't even use it becuase it did not adjust to a comfortable position for me. I am 5 ft tall. Needless to say this item was returned.
1,Just don't get it,"I've followed the instructions. When my baby was small it seemed to suffocate her. Now that she can sit, the draw strings seem uncomfortable to her and that she could easily fall through if I don't support her entirely which defeats the purpose of being hands free."
2,I hated it. I returned it.,"I'm just over 5'3"" and I absolutely could not use this sling. It just was not comfortable. The strap seemed to hit me in the wrong spot on my shoulder, and it just hurt. So I returned it. It does seem like it's really well made. But I thought that it was maybe a little too heavy even before I tried putting my daughter inside. I ended up finding a pattern online and sewing a basic pouch sling myself using trouser-weight fabric."
2,I just cannot decide about this sling!,"I love the idea of this sling and it is sturdy and attractive, but my 10 week old son just cannot get comfortable in it. I keep thinking he's just too small and is getting lost in it, but even as he grows I am still trying to make him more comfortable by adding a blanket to position him better. I really want to use this sling, but I feel like he's either too deeply inside the sling and he will suffocate or by adding a blanket underneath him, he's too close to the edge and will tumble out. The edge draws strings to tighten him in just do not do the trick. I'll keep trying because this product seems like a great idea and it was not cheap, but perhaps it's just a little too much work for a newer baby.If this company or any other consumer, has any ideas on how to improve my situation with this sling,I would love to hear from them. Email me at: Jul262003@yahoo.com"
1,mom of 2,Please don't buy this product.I tried this carrier to my son. The buckle is hurting me so much and my son is not comfortable at all. I bought this when he was 5 months old. Now his 8 months.
2,Not good for newborns,"This sling was too deep for my newborn son. I'm a fairly tall mom---5' 7"" and my baby was also fairly long - 21 inches at birth and 7lbs 6.8 oz. When I placed my baby in this sling, it completely swallowed him. It was difficult to adjust the sling and uncomfortable to carry the baby hanging so low in the sling's pouch. I think this carrier is probably better for bigger and older children. I found another sling called the Maya wrap that was great for a newborn and for an older child. The Maya wrap is the about the same price as the Premaxx sling carrier, but it is easier to use and much more versatile. Plus, the Maya wrap comes in a variety of colors and patterns. You can find more information about the Maya wrap at www.mayawrap.com. The only reason I gave the Premaxx sling a 2 rating is because I liked the bold orange and red color."
4,Great sling-- but not for active babies.,"I loved this sling just from looking at it. It has some structure, so I don't feel like baby is going to slide out. The padding is comfy and supports baby well. I could fit a couple diapers, wipes, my keys, credit cards, and cash in the pockets. The look is not ""babyish"" so daddy is willing to wear it too. I'm only 5'1, and I had no trouble carrying baby in this (although the straps did have to be adjusted as far as they would go). Once she was in this and moving, she would fall right to sleep and be comfortable for hours. I used it all the time when she was sleeping a lot.Now my little girl wants to be awake and moving herself and wants to see everything around her, so this does not work at all. But for those first couple months, it was a godsend. I highly recommend it for getting grocery shopping and such done during baby's early months-- especially if you have another young child to take up your precious cart space."
1,disappointed,"Even though I am 5'7'', I didn't like how long the sling was. This sling is not very supportive and It doesn't have padding for either the baby's head, nor the shoulder. I felt my baby could fall out when bending certain ways. I also felt like my one month old could suffocate the way the material flaps over her face. I can't imagine trying to securely hold an older child in it. The only things that were good about it was that it was easy to put on without directions and had a pocket for keys, $, etc. No wonder EVERY one of the sling boxes at the store was opened- everyone probably tried it and returned it. I returned after a week a got the NOJO for less $, a comfortable fit, and peace of mind."
1,Doesn't fit well,"I have tried many slings and finally choose to go with a different one from NewNativeBaby.com because this sling doesn't fit small mothers and I am only 5'4"" with large bust."
2,"not for petite people, plus it isn't comfortable","We bought this because we thought it would be really easy to use and comfortable for the baby, plus we thought it would be very stylish even for my husband to use a sling. We like the way it looks but my baby hated it the first moment she went inside it. She got lost inside of the huge compartment! Also I had a hard time using this (she was hanging down near my thighs!) because I'm a petite woman. I'm 5'2"". Now that our baby is 6 months old, we thought we'd try it again as a hip carrier, but she still hates it because the straps dig into her. I wouldn't recommend it for shorter people."
2,Doesn't seem safe,"I bought this carrier when I was still pregnant, and now I wish I had tried it out with a baby in it. It doesn't seem safe at all! Thought I'd try again when my son was six months to use as a hip sling but it seemed like he could fall out of it at any minute, and he started crying as soon as I put him in it. Also uncomfortable for the wearer. Go with a front style carrier instead for the security."
1,Complete Waste of Money,"I ordered this carrier when my son was a few weeks old and tried to use it periodically as he grew and he has consistently hated it. I found it difficult to use, the instructions were ridiculously short and no help whatsoever, and my son was never comfortable. He always started crying the minute I put him in, and when he lays in it, the folds collapse over his face and his neck is bent. I tried and tried different positions and little adjustments and looked for instructions from other carriers, but no matter what I did, this particular sling remains awkward and uncomfortable for both mother and baby. He's seven months now and maybe it will work later as a hip carrier (I took the tags off when it first arrived and I never got around to returning it), but in the meantime, I bought a Baby Bjorn Active carrier and I HIGHLY recommend that one instead."
2,not as easy to use as I thought,The sling was not very easy to use and never seemed to reall work right
1,Useless!,My baby hated as soon as I put him in this carrier. It is so claustrophobic for him that he looked miserable inside. Plus it is impossible to carry for even 5 minutes with only one shoulder strap. It is somewhere in the garage...I already forgot where I put it...
3,Still waiting for the breakthrough,"We have tried to get this sling to work, but can't yet. The baby is bent across our bodies and even though she likes to sleep, I can't feel that it's good for her. We have thought of returning it, but may keep it to see if it fits better when she's older."
1,how do you adjust this thing?!,"It ALWAYS hung too low on both me (5'7"") & my husband (6'1""). We keep trying it thinking it will work and it always ends with our daughter screaming. She loves the baby Bjorn but is pushing 18 lbs now & my back can't take it. I'd like to make it work but haven't in been able to in the last 8 months. Also, my neighbour's baby hated it too and our babies are of polar-opposite dispositions. I may choke on the $70 and spend another $60 on ahip-hammock."
4,pretty solid anthology,"Webb's definition of what 'Stand Up Poetry' is contains all that I love in poetry--including humor, sensuality, sexuality, and more. In fact, Webb's introduction is a great one. I'd recommend you read it, if nothing else. Now, I wouldn't say that all the poems are great, or that even all of them live up to Webb's criteria, but you get a lot of good work in here. You'll find Kim Addonizio (two wonderful poems by her), Charles Bukowski, Lucille Clifton, Wanda Coleman, Billy Collins (always a pleasure to read), Stephen Dunn, Russell Edson, Paul Hoover, Maxine Chernoff, Dorianne Laux, Bob Hicok, Thomas Lux, Pattiann Rogers, James Tate, David Trinidad, Fred Voss, and B.H. Fairchild's phenomenal poem ""Body and Soul.""as well as good work from Kurt Brown, Philip Dacey, Barbara Hamby, Deborah Harding, Tony Hoagland, Suzanne Lummis, and Dan Nielsen.Trust me, this is an anthology you want to read."
2,a rare disappointment from this great musician,"I've been an avid fan since the early 70's when Mahavishnu Orchestra and then Shakti concerts blew my mind, but find this album very disappointing. Of course there's some virtuosic playing here, but mostly on the part of bass players and drummers, while Eric Johnson gets in the best guitar solo. But the compositions are uniformly unmemorable. Uninteresting charts, blaring sax, a few fast solos that go nowhere - it sounds like out-takes from a Mike Stern session, only Stern does this kind of fusion far better. Listening to this after the superb new ""Saudades"" CD featuring John Scofield covering some of McLaughlin's back pages makes me wonder what happened here."
2,Very Efficiently Done,"With the glossy keyboards, sax, and processed sound of McLaughlin's guitar, the playing and material pretty much sounds like Mahavishnu circa 1984-85. Some interesting computer generated sounds are added, but the overemphasis on chops and weak material make the music pretty forgettable."
2,"Return to fusion of the past, Unsatisfing",I think I have about every cd John McLaughlin has made but this one is a big dissapointment. It sounds like an uninspired return to the 70s fusion sound that has not aged well. Sounds processed and not very soulful to these ears; but there's lots of other McLaughlin out there to listen to so pick something else.
2,Very disappointing...,"I respect John for trying to break new ground, but this album completely lacks any kind of emotional depth. It sounds as if the musicians e-mailed their parts to the producer and then they were smashed together in a home studio. The music (while technically chalenging) isn't very memorable. I've listened to this album many times, trying (in vain) to ""get it"" but I just can't. There's no fire, no swing and very little jazz on this album. Instead of buying this you should buy a copy of Michael Brecker's final album ""Pilgrimage"". It offers the same awe-inspiring musicianship, but also contains some great song writing as well."
1,Wish I had read these reviews,"If you look at the image of the product, the bike mount is actually on the opposite side and thus cannot actually be attached to the bike. Apparently they didn't test the production version. Sadly, I'm the fool because several reviewers already pointed that out."
1,Amazon-supplied picture is not the item you will receive!,Lock cannot be hung off the top tube as the primary image would have you think. See the other user-supplied pictures for ways to attach to your bike to determine if this will work for you before ordering. Unsatisfactory.
1,complete ass,"let's not even mention that the clamp is on the wrong side, which although not a real ""defect,"" makes this a pain in the ass clamp to your bike. also the clamp is probably too wide for a lot of frames, so you'll have to pad with additional material so it doesn't slip downward. most importantly, the quality of the metal is seriously awful. i've only been using the lock for about a week and it wouldn't stop sticking, and finally just completely froze. the key simply will not open the lock. spend your money on a better model, it'll be worth the extra cost"
1,stupid-protracted-unforgivable defect,"Kryptonite Keeper 12 Standard Bicycle U-Lock with Bracket Bicycle U-Lock (4-Inch x 8-Inch)The bracket for attaching lock to bike is mounted on the wrong side of the""U,"" rendering it useless. Practically all reviews point to the defect. Yet Amazon continues to send this defective item to its trusting customers. Very shabby. Wake up Amazon!"
1,How is this still possible after years of the same review?,"I bought this lock as well as a white 'skin' cover. After driving myself crazy thinking I was missing something, I look at the reviews and find that many people have had the same issue that I've had. The piece that fits into the bracket to mount it onto your bike is on the wrong side of the lock. Because of the design of the lock you cannot simply change sides. This is a flaw that must occur at assembly.Like previous reviewers, I'm dumbfounded that a company such as Kryptonite that has been around for many years would not only have this problem but it would be ongoing.I'm returning the lock and the skin, which by the way is a huge pain in the rear to put on the lock.But another lock if you want it to clip onto your bike frame."
2,Frustrating,"This lock is great when it actually works, but every other time I try to lock or open it, the key won't actually work. I have spent 5+ minutes on many occasions just fussing with the key trying to open the lock - which can be incredibly frustrating!!"
3,"Good lock, frame clamp error","Other reviewers are not kidding. The frame clamp is on the wrong side. How does that happen? It's almost comical in its absurdity. The lock is of good quality. I use a cable lock as well, but together I'm very comfortable leaving my bike locked up."
4,Good lock,"Good value for price. Key sometimes gets stuck in the lock, but it unlocks the lock with a little jiggling."
4,"It works, mounting bracket is adjustable.","It works good enough so far. By loosening the screw on lug on the shackle you can rotate it to allow the bracket to mounted in different positions. I have it mounted on the seat tube on the right side, keeps it out of the way of the water bottle cages."
1,Terrible Lock!,"I was happy to find the kryptonite lock at a convenient price. However, after using the lock for a week, I couldn't open it. I googled the problem and people advised to try and jiggle the key. I did that and it worked for a little while but then I couldn't open it again. Right now it's stuck on the bike rack and I can't even return it. It's a really really bad lock and I wouldn't recommend buying it."
5,Great Lock,"Had to get a new lock because my old cheapie one rusted shut in the rain. This one has held up great so far, it seems to be really great quality. I haven't mounted it on my frame so that part really isn't an issue for me. I would definitely recommend it to anyone."
2,Hard to Lock & Unlock,"I have had kryptonite locks that worked just fine in the past, but this one stinks. It is extremely difficult to get the key to turn all the way to fully unlock it or lock it. I think this is due to poor machining of the metal on my lock. They need some better quality control."
4,good lock with a little flaw,the overaall quality of this lock is great and it does the job the only con about this lock is that it takes me some effort to twist the key to unlock it
2,Not Satisfied,Lock is ok not perfect..On the second day the key is not turning..and yes button is on wrong side..I have GMC Denali Bike and I ordered through Amazon
4,Theft deterrent for a great price,"No bicycle lock is going to keep your bike safe from determined thieves, but a beefy item like this will certainly keep the honest thieves honest. It's a little heavy for my preference, but my wife really wanted something substantial to secure her new bike. This does have a nice little bracket that holds the lock to the bike frame while riding, and the keys are flat and unobtrusive so they can be tucked away in a pocket or bag. I'd have to say this is a pretty cheap way to have a little peace of mind."
4,Nice lock but weird mounting angle,"Overall, it's a nice lock with a reasonable price.The lock looks good, size and weight are just normal and enough for locking up to most of the fixing structure.Only thing is that the mount has a weird angle, so you have to play with your particular bike to find the best fit.Didn't get chance trying with a thief at this time :p, but the key looks pretty good for the purpose."
5,great bike lock,"i love this bike lock. i am required by my university to have a u-lock when leaving my bike on campus, and this one is easy, light weight, but still really strong. i am very happy with this purchase."
3,Okay,Key has jammed 3-4 times within the first 25 uses (1/6th of the time) but only caused 30s-1min delay (has not broken yet). I like the hook lock design - you can slide one side on at angle or let it hang while you grab your keys.
3,nice product,"this lock is ok, but my bike was stolen, someone just broke the lock, so it's a good product...but...u know.."
4,Sturdy Bike Lock,"The lock is good but on a scale of 1-12 (12 being safest) this lock rates at a 7. This is Kryptonite's scale, not mine. Since I live in a downtown, sea-side area, bikes get stolen all the time. I use this lock in addition to a thick cable lock. Between locking the bike frame to a solid object using this lock, I intertwine the cable lock (figure 8 style) through & around the frame and through and around the tires. In doing this, even if they break this lock, they still can't ride off AND, they can't steal my tires very easily.Another suggestion... loose the quick release on your seat. It's hell having to stand and pedal if they steal your seat. Don't make it easy on them."
2,Frame clamp is on the wrong side,"I had the same problem that other reviewers had. I ordered the product anyway because I believed that Kryptonite makes good locks and stands behind their products. I just took it out of the package and noticed a major flaw. The fitting is attached to the opposite side of the lock as it is in the picture (above) and you cannot slide it into the clamp without hitting the bike frame. This is hard to describe but like others above me, I realized that it doesn't work. I thought that this was too stupid of a problem to be real, so I wracked my brain for about 20 minutes trying to figure out why I was so dumb and couldn't figure it out. Turns out, I'm not the one who's dumb--whoever assembled this attachment is! I guess we'll just carry the lock on our handlebars or in a backpack, but as far as attaching the lock to the frame.... FORGET IT! Thanks for reading"
3,Pros and Cons,Pros: Lightweight. Large enough for two bikes. Decent bracket.Con: I often have to fight to get the lock open.
1,Completely useless,"The tube is too thin to provide enough strength against using tools to cut off. My bike was stolen this evening in front of a crowded subway station, the lock got cut off completely. I won't recommend this lock to anyone who is going to park their bike in public space for more than 5 minutes."
1,"Stupid design, clamp on wrong side","Tempted to send it back, but it wasn't worth the trouble. The clamp is on the wrong side and you can't switch it to the other. Makes the bracket useless. Kryptonite should send all of us new brackets."
2,will not mount as shown in picture,"if you just want a u lock, sure buy this, its a quality lock. if you want a u lock that will mount on your frame, do not buy this..."
3,Nice lock,"This isn't the best lock in the world, but it's enough of a deterrent if you also have a cable on the bike."
1,Not for the ladies,This is not a lock for a female bike. The New York Standard with bracket is a better buy. From the same manufacturer.
1,DO NOT BUY!,Product is faulty. The brackets for mounting are incorrectly placed. Worst product that I have ever purchased through Amazon. Do not buy if you plan on using the mounts.
1,Do not buy this lock if you plan to hang it on your bike,"Wait, wuhhhh? That was my reaction the first time I tried to hang the lock on the mount provided....They put the bracket on the wrong side of the lock!!!! The slip-in bracket attached to the lock should be on the non-key hole side of the lock bar, like it is in the picture, but instead it is on the key-hole side - which juts out so far that the lock can't be hung flush with your bike frame! I wasn't sure if I should laugh or cry...DO NOT BUY THIS LOCK! Hey Kryptonite - Thanks for nothing."
2,Looks strong,"Looks strong but returned it because its really hard to to get it out of its holder, The holder can be designed better."
2,Clamp for bike is on the wrong side,"I bought this thinking that I would be able to mount it to my frame, so I wouldn't have to shove it in my bag all the time along with all my other junk and laptop. But, apparently the mount is on the wrong side, so way to go Kryptonite. Other than that, it seems like a simple enough lock, I'm pretty sure given the chance, someone could cut through the material because it seems that cheap. You get what you pay for."
4,Solid product,"Solid lock. My only complaints is that sometimes the key is hard to turn completely around to unlock, it really has to be perfectly inserted in order to turn. The hoop is a little small to get around a wide armed bike rack. Sits on the bike well."
1,Security Good - Frame Mount WORTHLESS,"I saw other people complain about this in reviews but I figured they had to have fixed the product... but I was wrong.The mounting system is on the opposite side as shown in the picture, and because that side of the lock sticks out further, you cannot use the mounting system.Not only that, but sliding the lock into and out of the mounting system took immense force on one of my locks (I bought two, the other works fine.)And, while trying to mount the bracket on to the bike frame, I used normal force with a screwdriver and drove the screws right through the plastic, making the mount unusable.It might work for security, but unless you plan on riding with a backpack all the time... BUY A DIFFERENT LOCK!"
1,Sullies the Kryptonite name,"I bought this lock less than 6 months ago, and today I had to break it open as it finally gave out. Even right out of the box, there was evident grinding between the key and the lock, and this grinding made opening the lock an exercise in frustration after only a few months. It would routinely take me over 50 rotations of the key before the lock would open, which is simply unacceptable. In addition to the defects inside the lock, the mounting mechanism is located on the wrong side of the lock. While possible to mount the lock in a fairly standard manor, it is still cumbersome to mount and un-mount the lock and is an indicator of the many flaws in this product. One of my friends also purchased this lock, and ran into the same problems. Save yourself the money and frustration and just buy a different lock."
2,Mechanism sticks despite maintenance,"This lock worked beautifully for the 1st couple of weeks (so much so that I ordered another for my girlfriend). However, shortly afterwards the lock became really awkward - the key wouldn't turn at all smoothly. It now requires a lot of jiggling/shaking/pulling/twisting to get the darn thing open (closing is fine). The one I bought for my girlfriend followed exactly the same time course as mine (i.e. fine for a couple of weeks then a nightmare to use).I HAVE tried oiling and greasing the locking mechanisms to restore smoothness of operation, but this only alleviates the problem for a couple of days at best (and even then it's nowhere near as smooth as it once was). Steer clear of this model, and any other with the same mechanism."
2,Frustrating to use,I feel like the lock is on the wrong side. A real pain to lock and unlock. The key can be pretty persnickety and not always work. Not a good lock if you are in a hurry to get somewhere. You have to fuss with it for awhile.
2,Cheap and faulty,"Yes, the bracket is an engineering fail. Yes, it can sometimes be a pain in the ass to open and close this lock with the key. Hopefully it is still a strong lock and the Kryptonite brand will deter some thieves, but if you have a choice, do not by this lock. This one is at the bottom of the Kryptonite barrel."
4,KRYTONITE Keeper 12 std with bracket,"Aside from the packaging, the Anti-Theft Protection Offer was the only information I received with my lock. No instructions or a hex wrench and for that, I'm giving this product 4 stars . After staring at it for about 10 mins, I mounted the transportation bracket to my bike in 5 mins."
2,"Clamp on wrong side, DOES NOT MATCH PRODUCT PHOTO","Based on reading other reviews, it seems like a fair amount of these locks are shipped with the clamp attachment on the side opposite to that shown in the photo. I received a lock with the clamp on the keyhole side. This placement means that it is impossible to hang the lock within the frame of the bike. You cannot move the clamp to the opposite side due to a metal bend on the opposite side of the U bar.You can still mount the lock but it will hang off to the side, and can catch your feet as you pedal!The lock itself seems sturdy, but the clamp issue is a big hassle."
1,My bike was stolen,My awesome bike was stolen when I used this lock. What more do I need to say? Invest in a REAL lock!
2,can't mount it on my bike,The lock cannot be mounted on a bike with the attached mounting bracket in a manner that is in-line with the bikes frame. The lock's main cylinder hits the bike's tube when mounting that way - so needed to mount so the lock alongside the frame instead of in-line - which gets in the way somewhat when riding. It is also difficult to get the lock back into the bracket after use. I tried contacting Kryptonite via their web site - but did not get a response. I had a Kryptonite lock about 8 years ago that worked well. This one sucks. I will never buy a Krytonite lock again..
1,Clamp doesn't work,"Received the lock on time, but the clamp was on the opposited side of the u-bolt and doesn't allow the lock to be mounted correctly."
2,Worst. Mount. Ever.,"The mount is on the opposite side of the lock from what is shown in the product photo, so there's not enough clearance to be able to mount this in a sane manner.The lock has to be mounted in a way that causes it to hang off the side of the bike, which gets in the way of pedaling. I also was unaware that the lock would rattle incessantly. Really, really disappointed by this purchase."
2,Don't buy if you want a long lasting lock,"Ok so the first couple weeks the bike lock worked fine. Slowly it was getting harder and harder to unlock. Finally, today I was trying to unlock for at least an hour until it finally came unlocked. That was about the time I threw the thing as far as I could and bought a better lock else where."
5,"Great product, long overdue","I really like the concept of this product, it's long overdue and makes so many projects easier. No math needed, just take the reading and find the same number on the other scale. I'm sure I'm not the only one who has struggled to mentally figure out half of 29 3/4"" or some such measurement. This tape leaves little room for error or mistake and no calculator needed! I may need to order another for the toolbox as I know this one will get claimed by my wife!"
4,Where's it made?,"My apologies to the maker if I missed it, but with a prominently American name as a company, you'd think it would be clear where and where not it's made. Anyway these things are very useful."
5,Big Time Saver!,"I bought one of these for myself a few years ago after getting sick of dividing fractions. Two sets of numbers allow you to find your center point. This is a great tool, but don't use it as your everyday tape measure. It's a specialised tool and you'll want it to last. Liked it so much I just bought one for my son-in-law."
2,Not the real meaning of the tarot,"This book would be better called A Partial History of the Tarot in France.Unfortunately the authors do not understand occultism, therefore they cannot appreciate the tarot.They are oblivious to the fact that the tarot depicts a process of initiation or self-realization.This is why the tarot is so popular today, and available in packs pertaining to a variety of traditions.The book ignores much contemporary work that is being done on the tarot.For example,R.J.Stewart has shown that elements from the Merlin tradition contributed to the tarot, though this is not mentioned here.This book simply does not understand the deeper meaning of the tarot."
3,It is as expected,Nu Stevia seems to be a better product for your health as opposed to Splenda and saccarhin products. It is shipped in a plastic bag with 1000 packets each one good for a cup of coffee or tea. It is sweet and quite natural tasting. The cost of buying it this way is much less than at a retailer in small quantities. Each shipment lasts about 5-6 months for our family.
1,Sugar trading on the Stevia name,"Unfortunately, this product only has 80mg of Stevia per 1g of powder. If you can do a little math, that means it's only 8% Stevia! How they can sell this as ""white stevia powder"" is beyond me.There are a lot of reviews about how this tastes so much better than regular Stevia. Apparently, these people don't realize they are eating a sugar (maltodextrin) product. If 8% is stevia, the other 92% must be maltodextrin, though they don't bother to tell you this on the package.The box claims that it will ""not raise blood sugar levels,"" which is not true. It will spike your blood sugar because of the maltodextrin (duh!).In addition, this product causes diarrhea, which I learned the hard way.DO NOT BUY!"
2,NUSTEVIA,"This is the second time we have bought bulk stevia from you, but the first timefor NuStevia. The first Stevia product was great, but this NuStevia item says onthe package non-bitter, but it has a bitter aftertaste. I wife doesnot like it atall and we will not be buying any more of this brand.thanks James"
2,"5 star taste, 1 star on blood sugar :(","I do not have Diabetes, but I do monitor my blood sugar with a high end One Touch Ultrasmart glucose monitor. I can verify unwanted spikes in my blood sugar using this product. This is very dangerous to those who are watching sugar intake. I think a person should choose and use wisely. I love the taste, but am shocked at how high of a spike I get to my blood sugar after 1 cup or tea or coffee with an avg of 1.5 packs.I'm cutting down to 1 pack max. I have been very anti-artificial sweetener lately because of false claims and side affects. I think I am going to stick with Splenda.Please be careful using any artificial sweeteners, especially those not approved by the FDA."
1,Buyer beware of how much you actually get.,"This is my first negative review but I felt I had to comment. This 1000 count is a RIP OFF.Each one of the packets has literally a DIME size amount or less per packet. I bought the 100 packet box before and only needed 1 packet to sweeten my coffee. In this 1000 count bag I need 2 packets to put in my coffee. So basically I WAY overpaid for a 500 count bag. I think these packets must be the ""misfits"" that got filled w/ too little stevia but the company doesn't want to let them go to waste. Buyer beware."
1,old patch,I have been ordering this product for years and never had a problem till now. The newer packets have less product in them. This latest box I received must be years old because it has the original weight. The packets do not dissolve well.
5,Best alternative to sugar,"I have tried all the artificial sugars, the pink, blues and splenda. This is the only alternative that I have used that is not bitter and has a natural taste. My husband can taste the difference if I try to cook with anything but real sugar, but I made some tea and didn't tell him and he didn't know the difference. It's so much cheaper to buy by the 1000. GNC sells 100 for $20, I got 1000 for $37 through Amazon."
2,Avoid. Contains maltodextrin...,"This contains maltodextrin, which has a glycemic index (GI) of 137. Refined white cane sugar has a GI of 100.Therefore, at 15 mg, the effect on your blood glucose and insulin is the same as if this stevia was mixed with 21% pure white sugar.Not good enough for me. Try Stevita or SweetLeaf brands, they don't contain anything that will spike your blood sugar like this brand."
5,The BEST tasting,"I have tried Sweetleaf Stevia Plus and their more concentrated no filler added version, and Stevia Supreme. I thought the Sweetleaf brand tasted like Sweet N' Low, including aftertaste. I use Stevia Supreme only in my coffee or strong flavored drinks like lemonade. I did not like it in hot or iced tea or used on top of foods, like cereal due to the similar aspartame taste.This AM I tried this product and I am amazed and forever converted. This is definitely the best of the 4 for flavor and sweetening ability (DO NOT use a whole packet in 12 oz.coffee as it is VERY sweet). I plan to spread the word to all who are still using Splenda or real sugar as this IS the product to use."
2,Misleading Packaging,"Don't be fooled like I was. This is not the deal you think you're getting. One thousand packets but half the amount of the regular retail packets. Amazon's weight: .0175 oz., Retail: .035 oz. It's a very deceptive deal which is where I have the problem."
5,A Must-Have Reference Work,"I have always considered this a must-have reference. It was so good that when I lent it out a long time ago, it never came back. Hence, the need to break down and buy another one."
2,not for aggressive chewers,"This tug toy is not for aggressive chewers. My American Bulldog, tore the handle apart right away and shredded that end. It took mere minutes for that to happen. This toy would be better for dogs who are not aggressive chewers. I give them 2 stars."
1,Lasted a couple days,"Our 9mo old doberman did a number on this. He was never left alone to sit and chew the toy up. The strands began to shred almost immediately during active play and pulling. Once one of the braids is broken, the whole toy begins to unravel. I would not recommend this toy if you have an active puller."
3,Not for aggressive chewers,"My puppy chewed through the red plastic handle and after that started on the ""rope"", which is many thin threads braided together. She was able to break the threads with no problem. If your dog likes to tug and doesn't chew, it should be fine, but for aggressive chewers -- it isn't indestructible."
3,Nice toy just not meant for dogs that chew,"Got this for a friends dog and it was destroyed within one week. The dog is a pit bull and loves to chew. He chewed it into one big tangle of threads. I bet if you only played tug with the dog this toy would be great, just don't leave it with the dog because its easily torn to ribbons especially with dogs that love to chew. I would recommend this but with the caveat to keep this toy up when done playing. Its a play toy not a chew toy like we found out."
4,A nice way to spend the afternoon.,"I saw this movie in the theater thinking it would be just like his other movie Blessed and Cursed, but he took things in a different direction. I think this one was a little better than the aforementioned, whereas the former seemed more like a very long music video that was intended to promote his next CD, this seemed more like a real movie with only one or two VERY LONG music scenes. Although it did have a small amount of profanity and showed a lot of skin in one of the performance scenes, it didn't feel nearly as compromising as watching a typical Tyler Perry movie. I gave this movie 4 stars instead of 5 because if you've seen ""A Christmas Carol"", you've seen this movie. Although the story line is kind of predictable, I'd still say watching this movie is a nice way for Deitrick Haddon and gospel music fans in general to spend the afternoon."
1,a beautiful soul,"I am a hugh Deitrick Haddon fan. I listen to his music almost non-stop. I ordered this DVD and checked my mailbox everyday in anticipation. It did not take Amazon long to deliver it. This movie sucked. It had a predictable plot- rock star almost dies. Then he goes through the same senario of seeing his life as it could be. He sees the errors of his ways, wake up and is a changed man to live happily ever after with the girl of his dreams. At times it was so hard to understand the parts that people were saying due to poor pronounciation. If I could I would get my money back"
4,Great Reminder That It Is Not All About Us,"This movie was a great reminder of God's power to grant second chances and his reminder that this life is not about us. In the end, it is about what we did in his name that counts and in his name, it's always about LOVE!"
3,It's OK,"I enjoyed the movie because I'm a fan of Deitrick, but the sound was a little muffled. The picture wasn't totally clear in the beginning, but cleared up towards the end."
4,I Liked It!,"This movie was pretty decent. It had some great music, and the quality was good as well. The story was somewhat predictable, but now days what movie isn't? I am a movie buff so I pretty much can follow any movie & figure out the plot within the first 10-15 minutes. However, this was a good movie. The acting in it was solid as well as the cast. I give it a 4/5 stars because I did enjoy it."
4,naughty naughty,"a delightful, insightful book that will make you marvel and giggle. Literary enthusiasts and Howard Stern fans are both treated to lively stories, definitions and explorations of meanings that are richly entertaining. Many will not like it because it contains ""equal opportunity offender"" jokes that are not exactly politically correct. Get over it.This work is sardonic and witty and entirely refreshing in its unrepentant iconoclasm.The book is funny and educational and a worthy edition to the individualist's library."
5,A Magical Book,"This book goes far, very far, beyond the pedestrian and misleading analyses of Judith Ewell or John Lombardi. Coronil offers a history of Venezuela that reveals connections among state-formation, national mythology, natural resource exploitation, and class rule. A must read, therefore, not only for all Latin Americanists but also many others."
2,Too much mumbo jumbo,"I bought this book in order to get some context for the situation today with Chavez. However, the auother seems to get lost in his own head and and for large parts of the book fails to describe anything other than a load of overly sohpisticated academic speak that nobody understands. While there are a few excellent chapters in it I felt a bit let down."
3,Typical Hole on a seam,"I have swore off Large expensive inflatables for my pool. Everyone I have had get a tear at one of the heat pressed seams and this was no exception. Great float but after one year, a hole. From now on its the $1.50 cheapos I can get at Walmart."
5,Robello: A Perceptive and Powerful Observer of the Human Condition...,"Poet Ariel Rubello's 128 page volume of poetry is gritty and potent stuff. In ""Sus Consejos,"" in a voice unique in its resonance, she tells of forbidden love and unsolicited advice:Mama said, ""Latin loves don't last long.""(stick to your own kind)She knows how hardTo sleep so goodToo late for herFor me he's goneUnder my skin another splinterUnder my sheet another crumb....Robello's ""Carta Personal"" in its evocative cadences invokes telling social as well as personal commentary:Abuelits's hands wake mesoft as masa they tell of maquiladora murderyoung girls left crumpled, braids cut offbits of pay slips found under pink nails....Ariell Robello, has demonstrated herself to be a uniquely perceptive observer of the human condition in general and an authentic and powerful emergent poetic voice.Dr. John R. Guthrie"
1,Disappointing! Don't waste your time or money!,"In Ariel Robello's amateur attempt to prove herself as an important, emerging chicana poet, she manages to represent the worst of today's chicano poetry. Like a hard-core-hyna-wannabe trying to convince herself that she is more than a white-washed American suburbanite, Robello fumbles with a hispanic ghetto vernacular, splicing Spanish words and phrases into her cliche-ridden workshop poems without a full grasp of their meaning. Do yourself a favor and read poetry by talented poets with a true chicana voice and aesthetic, like Sandra Cisneros or Gloria Velasquez, instead."
4,Pro's and Cons,"Pros:Nice rigid aluminum frame, compact, solid dovetail mounting, variety of reticules, variable brightness, glass viewport. Red dot point is nice and fine.Cons:""Wheel"" for adjusting brightness is so hard to turn I think I might break it off its mount when adjusting. Certainly likely to move the alignment position. -1 star. Until I use it a lot I won't know if this is going to be fatal because I hope to set it on one brightness level and leave it there. Kind if nit-picky but the reticule circles are uneven brightness so that the circle is fat on one side and thin on the other. Same affect on the cross.Overall:Good product for the price. It is what it is and works well for what it is. I won't complain about dew or lack of magnification, that is inherent in this type of finder scope."
3,Product works and fits great...,"Product itself is fine, fits ottoman well. I ordered the blue one, received the green one. I was kinda irritated but didn't complain because I was just going to dye it anyways to try to match the rest of my set. Anyone who dyes though knows Blue turns to black a lot easier than a warm color such as green. You guys really need to offer Black."
1,Did not make any difference,I had high hopes for this product because I have not been able to quiet my brake squeak any other way. Unfortunately the product made no difference when I used it.
2,"A fan, but not of this book","Unlike a few of the previous posters, I like McEnroe on the radio. However, this memoir falls flat...not unlike the blandness of Dunne's ""Harp"", another Hartford based recollection. I did enjoy the bits where McEnroe discusses his own father/son relationship with his child; I found a warmth and liveliness in those passages that was missing overall. If he wrote another book examining his experiences as a parent, I would give it a chance. If you are a local, you may appreciate recognizing some of the setting."
1,"Vacant, Vapid, Vacuous, Void, Vain","This book is meaningless, with no overarching themes or messages. Instead, Colin McEnroe just rambles on aimlessly in his arrogant and conceited style. The memoir is written backwards, starting with the father's death. You might think this would make for an interesting book; I had thought it would. Instead, their is no climax, no resolution, no anything. The book is really just entirely empty, with little going on, and serves on the allow Colin to preface his name with ""author."""
3,"Great for Airsoft, Bad for Real Guns","First of all, the shipping on this product was great. I placed the order on Monday or Tuesday and it arrived on Saturday.The mount was stable, and the appearance/ergonomics were nice.The adjustment system is where this product fails. It depends on four tiny screws, two across from each other, that nudge the free floating laser in the tip of the battery compartment. It's a cheap method of securing the laser, compared to other sights.I sighted the laser to exactly match my physical sights at 25 feet on my 40 cal pistol. After the first shot, the recoil had shaken the screws loose and the sight was off six inches to the left. After the second shot, the laser was on the target of the person two lanes over.I imagine for an airsoft gun, with no recoil, this sight would be great. But for any firearm with a kick, the adjustment is going to rattle."
3,"Functional, works, but limited","As usual for something of this pricing (low) it has limits. All metal, somewhat timely to adjust (take your time and don't strip the threads it is aluminum) it has decent power, moderate to low battery life and serves a good purpose for training tools like airsoft."
1,Lack Luster,"This outfit is a very thin piece of felt that was stiched together and the wig looks nothing like the model. I expected some differences, but not as much as there was."
4,Mandatory.,"Really interesting lecture for all type of physicians. Easy to read, easy to apply, makes easy to understand complex concepts. Should be mandatory in curriculum."
5,You can't find a better one !,"it's a great book, it has enhaced my understanding, not just of clinical reasoning but as well my understanding of my way of thinking, my understanding of life in general & other peoples way of thinking"
5,Excellent Introduction to Wine,"This is a great introduction for anyone new to wine, as I was. This is not intended to be the most complete reference for all wine, but is instead a colorful, focused, entertaining overview of wine today. Each chapter focuses on a different region or type of wine, providing background information on each wine area, the author's favorite wineries/producers from the area, a sample tasting (he picks several wines for you to try and also suggests alternatives if you can't find those particular bottles) and a quiz at the end to help you retain some of that information. A great book for any wine lover!"
4,Great introductory wine book,"Kevin's book is great in that it is short and concise, yet at the same time covers practically every wine making region and wine type and also offers recommendations for wine/food combinations and good vintage years. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the fact it was published in the early 80's...it's a little outdated on recommending good vintage years (at least for my pocketbook). It also has a chapter for selecting wines for a restaurant...great if you're a restauranteur, but not very useful if you buy wine for personal consumption. Other than that, highly recommended."
4,A great basic starting point for wine.,"Kevin Zraly wrote the book I wish I'd written. Good solid information on how to make sense of wine labels (which makes buying wine a whole lot easier) and good, thumbnail sketches of the world's wine growing regions.Not quite as fufilling from an aeshtetic viewpoint, for example not quite enough information about viticultural practices and how they affect the quality of wine. All in all, however, a great jumping off point for the novice."
3,Very Eerie,"It's strange to see this book title, especially with the 2002 date. The entire staff of the restaurant was wiped out on 9/11."
5,Great Book for Wine Novice,"This book is essential for a budding wine connoisseur. It keeps things simple and introduces you to the wine regions of the world, grape varieties etc."
5,Now Read This II,The book came quickly and in great condition. I love Nancy Pearl and will read anything with her name attached. I don't read as many novels as I used to read because I'm reading so many non-fiction books about books to read!! Silly me.
4,Neat tape for finding center,"Kind of gimmicky but useful. Good tape measure for doing just this, finding the center of a length easily. Case is fairly weak and light weight. Not the best built tape but will work for simple general use here and there when you just want to find center fast and easy with no math. Wouldn't recommend for heavy use or contract use as it would not hold up, plus the extra center-point markings would get more confusing."
4,It works for my use,"I wanted a cheap centering tape. I could not find at local hardware stores. This works great for me, but many pros will be disappointed. Stand out is like 6 feet, max and will not last long if its your primary tape. Great for using around the house occasionly to hang pictures random stuff. Its not a fatmax/dewalt heavy duty so be careful with your intended use."
5,Rocking Rocks,Just got them and wired them in. They sound really good and can handle way more power cleanly than we'll ever give them (tested them very loud).One issue - they are MUCH darker than the photo. Very dark slate specked resin.
2,Informative but incredibly boring,"This film succeeds as a basic review of the Victorian Age, however the majority of experts interviewed are incredibly boring making it hard to concentrate on the content."
3,Great Queens of England - Queen Victoria,This DVD is okay if you just want to learn the basics of Victorian history. It does not compare to any DVD produced by the History Channel for display or imformational purposes. I was disappointed in the DVD.
3,Hard to understand,"I tried to showing this to my AP European History students, but the audio was just to difficult to understand. Loud background music and thick British accents made it nearly impossible to understand what the narrator was saying. At one point, one of my students asked if we could turn on the captions just so she could understand what was being said! The production was just not very well done."
3,Escaflowne movie review,"The dvd itself was in good condition. The movie, however, was a little bit of a let-down. The plot was quite different from the series."
5,An Anime Masterpiece!,"This movie, aside from being wonderfulling animimated and superbly dubbed, it has a rich and fantastic story that makes one think about the world in a different light. This movie is sad and dark, beautiful and tragic. I would recomned this movie to any one who wanted to view a beuatiful, touching and sincere movie."
1,"if you believe Escaflowne is a good series, don't watch","I have a true fondness of Escaflowne the tv series. The movie is a complete waste of time. I have not talked to a single person who has seen this and like it. The plot (what little there is) comes and goes with little regard for things such as coherency. Maybe the animation is well done, but the character design still includes deformed triangles for noses. This will be a horrible investment to anybody's anime collection, so don't buy."
1,Huh?,"...I haven't seen the series, so this was my first take on Escaflowne. I've never experienced a movie that could move so fast one minute and be so boring the next. And what was so special about Hitome? She was so depressing, I kept expecting her to kill herself. If the series plays on network tv again, I might check it out to see if it makes more sense, but I sure wouldn't rent it after seeing this. I'm popping Cowboy Bebop back into my DVD player."
3,Unexpected Twist,I have seen the Escaflowne series and was quite surprised at this twist. The characters seemed the same but slightly different intentions and personalities....interesting
5,Esflowne the movie,This movie is a must see for the fans of the series. There's a lot of fight scenes and its well done. Really good movie...I suggest you buy it and enjoy
5,One Great Anime Movie!!,"You should go out and catch this movie in theatre because it's great!!! If you loved the anime series, then you'll definitely love this!The movie seems to focus toward a more mature crowd rather than the series. Just to let you all know, it does not take place after the series. It is like Utena the movie in which it takes place in an alternate sorta time. But don't worry!! Van and Hitomi get together as a COUPLE as always ^^ <3"
1,The worst movie ever!,"In short, this is the single worst movie out of a major TV franchise that I've ever seen. The characters are all twisted (re-invented), and the movie utterly fails to deliver on the new take. Even without watching the tv series, this movie is only mediocre. But compared to the excellent tv series, this is the worst adaptation (or re-creation) that I've ever seen, and I've seen many.The only thing that holds the tv series and the movie together is the music. I didn't think it was particularly good, but it was obviously of the same heritage and maintain the mood.If you liked the tv series, rent this one and see if you'd like it before buying it outright."
2,Ugh - another genre movie far removed from its inspiration,Not as good as the TV show. Diluted. Pass.
2,Horribly disappointing,"I shouldn't have been surprised to be terribly disappointed in the Escaflowne movie.I absolutely loved the animation style and the new music created for the movie.The effects of both were spoiled by the horrid translations, dubbing, and the disjointed feel to the story.A few hardcore, anime-loving friends watched it with me...ones unfamiliar with the entire television series. They understood the basic premise of the story, and still had trouble following the storyline.Even walking into the theatre knowing how vastly different the movie was from the series couldn't save it for me.I was embarassed to have hyped the movie up beforehand."
1,What happened?,"Im not sure this happened to anybody else but i bought this 3 disc thing and about an hour into the movie the audio and the visual just goes all to hell. So i figured maybe its just a bad disc because theres nothing wrong with my dvd player.So i sent it back and ordered another one, well guess what? The same thing happened, so i guess my dvd player was just telling me this movie was just gonna suck really bad so it spared me the agony.So i just sent it back and maybe i'll order the TV series later."
1,DVD didn't work,"The review title explains it all... Looked forward to the release, so it was very disapointing."
3,"Boring Movie, Great Extras","This movie was quite boring. In the interviews the director and cast said the movie is a total retelling of the story of Escaflowne compared to the TV series. ... Every concept and sequence throughout the movie was predictable if you have seen any fantasy film.The only good stuff about the set is the second and third disks. The second disk holds all of the interviews of cast and crew of the movie. You learn many aspects on what was going on during the production of the film and TV series. The third disk is the soundtrack for the movie. I have listened to the soundtrack. The CD has beautiful music. The best two songs are ""You're not alone"" and one other I cannot think of right now. All in all a very good music score."
3,OK Movie but not as good as series,"As a stand alone movie it was enjoyable. But some of the characters where rather weak. Like Dryden and Millerna. Why even bother with those characters. I liked how Hitomi and Van seem older than in the series. In the series some of the chracters could be whiney at times.I had watched the series first and loved it. So it was difficult to seperate what I knew of the characters and the storyline while I watch the movie. The storyline basics was so different from the series that it made it a letdown for me.If you are going to watch the movie, don't watch the series first."
5,Very cool,"I loved the escaflowne movie!! I had never seen the series before, but it was still quite easy to understand. It started off a bit slow, but once things started rolling it was great. Music is by Yoko Kanno (Cowboy Bebop) so you cant expect anything bad coming from the music department. The movie has some cool swordfighting scenes and mecha fight scenes, and the story was overall enjoyable. I would recommend seeing where this movie is showing, and if its coming to your town, see it!"
1,Defective DVD,"The movie is great but this DVD is defective. Half way through the video starts [fading]out and at times crashes the DVD player. I played the movie on a Sony DVD player, a Playstation 2, and on a computer using PowerDVD and a same thing always occurs. A friend also bought the same DVD and the same thing happened to him so its not just my copy."
2,disappointing,"this movie is a joke. there are serious flaws in either the script or the translation, so most of the dialogue is laughable. The voice actors are uniformly miserable. Characters appear and disappear with no explanation, and many major characters in the series are introduced to say one line and not be heard from again. why are they even there?personally, i have no problem with the changes in the storyline, although i know many people who thought it was ludicrous. but the fact is, whether or not you are familier with the series, its just a bad movie. its not entertaining, its not interesting.i give it two stars primarily for the artwork, which is much better than the series, or most animated films."
5,great,"I had never seen this movie before though I had seen the show. I was surprised to find out the movie is something completely different than the show. I for one like when there is stuff like this where they'll use the same characters but make a whole other story to go with them. If I had to give this movie a rating, it'd definetly be 5/5 stars.When it comes to the actual product, I give it 5/5 as well. The picture quality is superb, the sound is very, very clear. It has both japanese and english dubs, and even though I watch it in japanese, I have taken a look at the english dub as well and it too is very well done. There are a few special features and some trailers as well. The case is just a standard 15mm case so it doesn't take up too much room on your shelf."
3,Not much to say...,"As far as anime movies go this one isn't ground breaking. It has the impact of a feather dropped from waist height. If you purchased the Escaflone series be happy with the great series you just purchased, and let this one sit in amazons warehouse."
2,Awful movie,This movie does no justice to the series what's so ever. The begining of the movie has a very meaning scene for me. Then after that it was bizzare.
1,Wow! Not in a good way.,"Complete mess of a movie. The lame story gave me headaches and made me realize only a blind person should watch it. The series, on the other hand is fantastic. If you've made the mistake of watching the movie then wash out the putrid taste by watching the original series then feel free to ask your self, what were they thinking? (Making money, of course)"
2,A big letdown.,The movie is nothing like the series. Keep that in mind when you watch it. It is still wonderful but I expected more. Escaflowne was a wonderful series. The movie is dark and more serious. It is more slowly paced. Not as enjoyable as the tv series.
1,"Outstanding Movie, Worst product release ever","I absolutely Love the Escaflownea Movie and series, however this is got to be the worst release in history the Video looks washed out & heavily pixelated. The video looks like they used a VHS tape as the master & thought we the users would not notice! Then there is the audio when is sound coming from 1 speaker and not the other 5 considered True HD 5.1. This is just another reason to prove that Bandai America and the F#&*%ed up Hominese should be shut down permanently and sell there licenses to companies that know what there are doing. If you see this product in a store don't buy it, you will see better video results on the stuff on there youtube channel than this piece of garbage."
2,Don't Buy it.,"I would not buy this if you have not seen the origional series, and for that matter I wouldn't buy it if you have. This movie does not do the great series any credit. Though many of the characters in the movie are the same as in the show, the entire plot is different. Buy the series, and not the movie."
5,"People bash it, but it wasn't really THAT bad","I've read reviews with people bashing the movie, saying it was too predictable and that there were too many cliches. Well, I think that cliches can be put to good use and can highten the impact of the movie. Whether or not the specific parts of the movie were unique, the combination of those parts, combined with the music, brought out a great movie which i love to watch over and over. The fight scenes were great. And even though most of the characters only had small roles, this movie mainly revolved around two characters, whose roles were fairly well done."
1,Absolute Junk,"You cant read a book worse than this one. Unorganized, pointless, and really of no help to any business person. Keep looking, dont buy this little junk book."
5,Stuart Levine's Six Fundamentals of Success,"As a self-employed business owner, I am always looking out for ways to increase my productivity and profitability. I found The Six Fundamentals of Success to be full of pearls that motivate me and help me to improve with simple messages. It also has great insight into the interpersonal skills necessary to do business effectively today. A great read!Robert M. Dickinson CLU, ChFCFinancial RepresentativeNorthwestern Mutual Financial Network"
4,Great Advice for Leaders on their way up,"As a Vice President for a Fortune 1000 company, I surely appreciate Levine's Six Fundamentals because it helps me tremendously in leading my team of 200+ people and advancing myself on the corporate ladder.I have told my people to read and buy this book because if they understand and put them to practice, that will help me do my job better. Levine should put out a ""Fundamental IQ Test"" and I will test my people on how much they truly get the concepts. I have read more than 100+ leadership/management books in the past 10 years and this is certainly one of the best I 've ever read! Ram Charan's Execution is the only one book recently that can match this Levine's book. A Very Well-written book!"
4,good book,"always fascinating to read books by successful people, as what made them the best can translate into my work as a physician businessman"
1,Very Ordinary,I would not recommend this book. It is extremely basic and anyone with any common sense can figure this out themselves.
1,Pure Trash,"This book insults the intelligence of any successful business person. Ironic that the book discuss ethics when, in my opinion, to charge money for this drivel is unconscionable!"
1,Exceptionally bad book.,"I read this poor excuse for a management book. Returned it already. Don't waste your money or your time, worthless dribble, nonsense. Don't know how it got published."
5,Very Good Book,Book was very beneficial. Good book for any professional. It is a nice book to have and keep for reference.
3,Hints from Heloise for CEOs,"The book consists of short, pithy observations about fundamental ideas. They're good reminders, no doubt ... and really do express the basic blocking and tackling leaders ought to start with. No Ah-ha! moments, but that's OK. Buy a used book, not new. You'll feel better about the purchase. Community college or Businessess 101 university instructors: this could be a good replacement for part of your absurdly-expensive texts in business or business communications classes. Simply expressed, easily understandable.But buy used."
5,A MUST READ TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS,"This book is just what the Dr. ordered. Stuart's thoughts/insights, and how he made them seem so clear and concise was truly ""genius"". I am recommending that my senior management team read this book ASAP. I know that it will provide immediate value to our company."
1,Not very original,"This poorly written, unorganized book, does not have an original thought. Dont waste your time. My friends hated the book and couldn't finish it."
1,Wonders never cease...,"It never ceases to amaze me to see what level of trash can be published in this country. This book is garbage. My guess is that the favorable reviews for this book are from the ""friends and family"" of the author."
1,Ouch.... this one really hurt !,"Poorly written book, no substance at all. This small book has no value, try ""THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER,"" much, much, much better book."
1,save your money. this book is poorly written.,There are many books out on the market now on this subject. I unfortunately purchased this one. It it set up in hard to follow chapters that drone on and on. For offering so many pages this book doesnt offer much easy to follow helpful information. I now must go out and buy another book. Waste of my time and money. My suggestion: save YOUR time and money and buy another book. I know Eric Gertler was involved with the privacy industry before he wrote this book...and its quite obvious that this is his first time out writing because this book is so bad. He should stick with his business career and stay out of writing... because the guy is (to be blunt) an idiot at writing books.
1,Book is too generic,"This book gave me nothing new, it is all about generic knowledge and common sense. Not sure about the time it was written, but now everybody knows about keeping SSN private, and shredding important documents and bills before trashing. It is also obvious that government and private organizations may have all information about you; and such information can be used against you, if compromised. To my opinion, if you know nothing about security - buy this book and read it. It will give you a basic understanding on what to do to protect yourself."
1,I agree. This book is boring and hard to digest.,Unfortunately I also wasted my money on this book. Thankfully it's winter time and I have a fireplace...so at least the book will soon serve some purpose.
1,Prefer Robert Hammond's book,I agree with the other people who were disappointed by Gertler's book. For those who really want an easy to read and informative book on this subject please check out Robert Hammond's book.
1,dense and incomprehensible,Mr. Gertler might know something about privacy issues but his writing is so difficult to follow it's hard to glean anything helpful. I found myself glazing over while trying to read. I definitely do NOT recommend this book. In fact I do not understand how he got any positive reviews. They must be friends or family.
5,Very clear and interesting to read as a reference,"The previous posts seemed personal, like a popularity contest between two authors' personalities. I have not read the entire book, but I used it as a reference to see what my work could find out about me when I use the email system there. All I can say is that I found some pretty interesting information and it was written in a very clear and succint and interesting way. Prying eyes contains more useful stuff han any other book out there that I've seen."
5,An Essential Read,"Prying Eyes is an essential read for anyone with a computer, a cell phone, a credit card, or a mailbox. Gertler alerts the reader to the very real risks of life in the information age, while contintually offering suggestions for how you can protect yourself. He covers topics that reach far beyond those normally associated with identity theft, like privacy in the workplace, the confidentiality of medical records, and the ways we all allow our homes to be invaded every day. Yet, Gertler offers these sobering facts without becoming hysterical. Serving as more than just a warning, Prying Eyes offers its readers tools to protect their privacy, while still allowing them to profit from all that technology has to offer."
1,save your money,I don't know who the reviewer who mentioned Amanda is talking about but I bought this book and really found it boring and hard to read. I couldn't understand how anybody could write anything positive. I checked out that one reviewer (NEWBOY) and his other books he's reviewed...Guess what? The guy buys books about believing in aliens from outer space living here with us right now. I guess if he can believe in somehting as unbelieavle as that it makes sense he can believe this book is at all good. Trust me. Save your money and buy some other book on protecting your privacy. That's what I'm now going to have to do because I found this book so completely unreadable.
1,waste of time,This book was difficult to read. Too much information presented in a difficult formatted manner. I dont recommend this book to anyone. It's a snoozer.
5,How to make a quilt that fits your bed.,"This book has helped me make my quilts fit. I use it in determining whether I need an additional border; will the pattern I have chosen fit a twin, full or queen size bed; and most of all the correct size and number of blocks needed for a quilt. Every quilter should have this book!"
2,"Nice looks, but...","The watch is nice looking at first, but after a month of working (at my desk) the paint is wearing off the band. I'm very careful not to drag it on my desk and I treat it like a fragile piece of art. Regardless of how careful I have been the paint on the band is wearing after such a short time and for the amount of money you pay I would expect the metal to be anodized to improve the durability of the paint. Honestly this watch is not worth 200$ bucks and if I can get my money back I will for sure return it. Obviously Nixon is a style over function watch, but I would expect a little more function for the price."
3,Worth seeing but not buying,"For those seeking the wonderful Documentary that was made around the same time, this is not it. This biographical film has beautiful costumes and solid performances BUT the actual film quality is very bad. Most of the scenes are extremely over-exposed. If you want to learn about Anna Pavlova's life, see if you can find a rental copy; but it's definitely not a ""must have"" for your library."
3,a lesser film about the great Pavlova,"Despite really poor film quality and terrible dubbing, this film is nevertheless quite beautiful, visually and especially in the sentiment with which Pavlova's personal will, determination, and discipline are portrayed.Beliaeva plays Pavlova well and dances well, bringing to life ""The Dying Swan"" and many of the ethnic dances for which Pavlova was singularly known.The film is not great perhaps, but it is a glamorously illustrative education in the power of the human spirit to overcome personal and impersonal obstacles, which in Pavlova's case were illness and war."
3,For Anna Pavlova fans,"If you're a Pavlova fan, you'll enjoy the film. If not, you'll probably want to spend your Friday night watching something else. Production values are okay. The lead doesn't dance well enough. None of problems matter if you are a Pavlova devotee. If you've read Keith Money's book, you won't find anything new in the film. Still, it's fun to see Anna celebrated in celluloid."
4,A Wonderful Intro To Watercolors & Stamps!,"I have been stamping for awhile and wanted to get into watercolor. I am so glad I found this book! After reading the book (the step by step instructions were easy to follow), I got results that were truly amazing. I did not know how to properly use watercolors until this book! Also, many of the stamps I had on hand were easily substituted for those used in the book. It was a great purchase!!!!"
1,Useless,Avoid this book at all cost. It was completely unhelpful. It does not even have the correct type of verbal ability questions. And has no! practice exam.
5,like melted caramel,"After the disppointment that was Good Woman, one of the truly greatest voices in contemporary music got it all together on this gem and released one of the greatest soul albums of the 90s. With sympathetic production, especially from Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, Gladys purrs and growls in her gorgeous rich alto and sings with a passion that can lift your spirit or have you bawling your eyes out. There is not one weak track on here and the End of the Road medley could go on and on forever as far as I'm concerned but why oh why was that stupid monologue tacked onto the very end? What comes before is just so sublime, though, that this still gets five stars."
5,just Gladys,I Love all Gladys Knight music. it's pleasure having sound in my car while drivng down the road or even in my house. Go Gladys keep doing what you do!!!!!!
4,Contains a classic live performance!,"This CD gets its four stars on the strength of one track: An eleven-minute live medley of four of Gladys's favorite love ballads. Knight sets the mood with a down-home monologue that gets the crowd worked up before she even begins to sing. And when she does sing, the reasons for her enduring appeal are plain to hear. Her End Of The Road is the sound of a woman who has done some serious loving and living. Though many of the other tracks are filler, you'll want to hear the medley again and again."
2,Dont bother with this...Get Click n Burn Plus Instead,CLick n Burn Plus (also by Stomp) is a much better program. This software offers the same basics with a few more USELESS additives. Like who needs to burn on 4 drives at once? Don't waste the money on this so-called upgrade. Click n Burn Plus delivers for less than half the price.
2,keep looking,"The starter guide is filled with useless information and there's no manual. The Help section does not let you search topics and the content headings that are there don't cover anything on editing, effects or commands and abilities. If you want to just burn mic audio, copy tunes or do minor effects on music like fades and joining tracks this is ok, but if your hopes are higher you may be let down. The worst part about clicknburn is that when you apply a reverb or any effect, the actual volume level of the music is diminished by at least 20%!"
4,"Nice James Last album, beautiful easy listening music.","Nice easy listening music. The DVD was as advertised and arrived within the time promised, very satisfied. I would recommend this DVD."
4,Rebecca wall clock,"It is nice. the second hand I thought was a little wobbly, but works just fine. two music choices, so far very accurate. Solid wood clock, great quality."
2,For Tablature Users Only,I do not recommend this software if you prefer to use standard music notation. Everything is in tablature-they should have explained this in the description.
1,NOT IN MY HOUSE ANYMORE,"vince has left the building and hopefully never, ever finds his way back, this in your garbage, (...) i haven't seen a wwf pay per view, worth watching in over four years, but for some reason i keep buying them, hoping one of them will be worth something. so far, no chance in hell."
3,WWF Unforgiven,"This is the first PPV of the ""Stone Cold era"", as Steve Austin makes his first PPV WWF title defense vs. Dude Love. This was a super match, with great brawling, great fan heat, and entertaining antics by Mr. McMahon outside the ring, that added to, rather than distracted from the title match. The other good match on the show was the Undertaker-Kane inferno match, which was better than their WrestleMania encounter. The undercard really dragged though, except for the evening gown match. Basically, a two match show."
3,"A Great PPV,but.....","Unforgiven'98 is a great PPV. With that said the dvd is lacking. There are no extras,so it's just the ppv. That doesn't bother me though. However,there is also no menu and you can't pick a match to watch by itself. There are two chapters. The second one starts about half-way through the event. But who cares? It's WWF nostalgia at its best. Just watch and enjoy because it is a really good PPV."
2,unfogiven-ok show at best,Unforgiven was the show that marked the start of the stone cold title era.is match with dude love is a great match and is defiantly recommended as one of the years best.owen hart vs hhh and the inferno match were both ok but not great or good.Seeing sable though in the evening gown match was very entertaining.
4,wwe fan kane and undertaker,the first few matches were good but on the back it said nothing about midnight express and rock n roll express fighting but still good
5,"Great ppv, Great price","This was one of the better ppvs i've seen and i've seen many of them. The best matches were the Championship match between Stone Cold and Dude Love and the inferno match Kane vs Undertaker, there were also five other good/great matches."
3,OKAY BUT NOT GREAT.,most people think this was great but i think it wasn't as good.the inferno match was plain old boring. The stone cold match was great. i recommend this but i thought it could have been better.
1,WROTE CD,"YOU GUYS SENT ME THE WRONG CD! THE CD THAT YOU SENT ME WAS ""From I Extreme II Another"" BY THE SAME ARTIST. PLEASE SEND ME A RETURN AUTHORIZATION SO I CAN RETURN THE CD THAT YOU SENT ME AND SEND ME THE RIGHT CD THAT I ORDERED ""II D Extreme"" BY THE ARTIST II D Extreme."
3,light but amusing,"After reading this I was reminded of both, ""The Nanny Diaries"" and Jack Finney's New York time travel book, ""Time and Again."" The Deed is a snarky read and the idea of a young ad exec becoming the sole owner of Manhattan is intriguing. It will keep you amused for a couple of days. I'll be interested to see what Blanchard comes up with next."
4,I liked this book!,It's nice to read a stress-free book about a modern day treasure hunt! The author has a very good ear for dialogue. I can't wait to read more of his works.
2,"Not that great of a game, so far","I bought this game last week and have yet to get a mission started. The game comes with wrong aircraft configuration files and you have to figure them out yourself.Doesn't matter what mission I try to get, it always says not enough fuel. I have no idea on how much fuel to get. So I go on the forums and hear you have to fly in FSX for 10 minutes and multiply this and do that then stand on one leg, spin around and whistle Dixie.Why could'nt they just put the proper config files in? Why? They were too lazy.I guess I will have to figure it out myself. If you get this game and plan on flying and doing runs right away, think again. I didnt do my homework, so now I am stuck with it.I will review again if I can figure it out."
1,Disapointment,Out of the box it did not work. It would not install properly. After downloding other files I was able to install it. I was able to flight couple of missions however it would not record the mission as complete. Wasted my money.
2,You get what you pay for,"I'm not too upset, I only paid a few bucks for this thing. It jams up, doesn't cut hair very well and is pretty worthless overall."
2,gets stuck,"I bought this item to trim my beard soley, it's light weight and the blades seemed mis-aligned before I plugged in, on the first use the blades got stuck, as they say you get what you pay for, cheap price cheap product."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"Worst pair of clippers I have ever owned! The head doesn't oscillate properly and thus doesnt cut hair. I got one strip of hair buzzed off and then they stopped working all together. Luckily I shave my head bald so it wasnt as horrible as it could have been, but I did have to use 2 full razors to reduce and then finally shave it after the clippers failed me."
5,Shell Shaker by Leanne Howe is A MUST READ!,"The ease of transition from generation to generation in this book was marvelous. The magic and power of these women and how it affects their everyday life was so real. It was astounding how the story plays out with such detail and realism that the reader gets the idea this isn't fiction at all, but real life events disguised as fiction. Great insight into the behind the scenes action of today's Native American political scene and how it relates to ancient traditions (or doesn't relate . . .)A MUST READ FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN NATIVE AMERICAN HISTORY AND/OR MYSTERY. Thanks Leanne!! Any sequel coming?"
5,Excellent and fun read with enjoyable characters,"I disagree with the negative comments about this book. It is very readable with fun and interesting characters. I plan to teach it to undergrads and have no doubt they are smart enough to read it easily. Overall, Howe does a wonderful job of showing a Choctaw family in the late 20th century, with their families and living in a not overly-idealized Southern Oklahoma town."
4,Really good book...just a weird ending,"I have to agree with one of the past reviews for this book. This book was really good,the plot was very substansial, but there were a couple of problems with this one...first of all, unless I missed it, I do not think that there was ever a real concrete solving of who killed Agnes Rivera....plus this book ended really, really strange! I think that this book left a lot of questions unanswered for the reader. I think that in the end, the reading had to use his/her own imagination and come up with an ending that satisfied them.In the end...good book, but just a really weird ending!!!! I just hope that this not a precursor to what this author has to offer in future installments with his work."
4,"A Mom's Review of ""It's Great To Be Two""","I just purchased ""It's Great To Be Two"" for my daughter who's 2 1/2. I have found it to be a sweet, simple book to add to her collection. My child has a speech delay and books like these with wonderful, full-color photographs that she can identify with and, sentences containing only 4 to 5 words make it easy for a her to understand what is stated on each page. I would recommend this book by Fiona Pragoff. I think she done a lovely job creating a book designed to show the many accomplishments of a two year old."
5,Buy This Book,"I'm a new church start pastor and our service has grown a lot and I was thinking about adding a second service. Another new church start pastor gave me a copy of this book and I love it. I bought a copy of this book for everyone on the committee to determine if we should start it or not.This book gave wonderful examples of when to start, under what circumstances should we start and where we shouldn't start.Highly recommended. We are launching our second service before long! Get the book - buy a few extra copies for your worship team!UPDATE: This book helped so much. We are now a little over a year after starting our second service. If it wasn't for this book, I don't think we would have made it! If you haven't started a 2nd service before, read this book - do what it says, pray to God!"
1,Possibly the Wackest Album ever Made,This is so ridiculously bad! Its actually hilarious because its so bad. How did these guys get signed?
1,This album absolutly sucks! Don't let the artwork fool you!,"Don't buy this album if you don't want to hear garbage, wannabe gangsta rap. I thought it would sound ight or possibly even be somewhat rare. Nope, neither well sounding or rare! Sorry POET-T, keep rhyming on..."
4,Granulated Onion Spice,"Product was good. Bottle a little damaged. Shipping was as always on Amazon, way too high."
3,Karma for Carmen,"Great oldies done very well. Smoky, sexy and sultry voice. Takes me back a few decades."
3,fun for everyone......but use with caution,"it is fun for everyone, but i would like to let everyone know that the filter is not powerful enough for the pool. Also, i wouldnt advise leaving children alone in the pool, if you lean on the sides of the pool,they actually fall causing alot of water loss, not to mention how unsafe it is for smaller children who may get under the force of the water......."
3,needs flat land,"We got this to keep cool this summer. It was a fun for the one time we used it. Set up was easy. the only problem we had was our yard wasnt level enough to keep it a reasonable depth. You can still use it if its slightly off... but you lose alot of the water level. I noticed alot of people arent considering that any above ground pool you get has the same problem. this particular problem isnt a desighn flaw. Its just something you deal with, with any above ground pool. We decided it wasn't deep enough for us to keep. We would however keep it if our yard was level enough."
1,Pump stopped working!!!!,"The pump stopped working TWO WEEKS after I bought it! Now I am having a hard time getting the warranty and replacement done by Intex. VMInnovations was great and Amazon was great, but I would not recommend and Intex product!!!!"
2,Not the best,"This pool worked great for about a month, then got a huge rip and actually deflated, water and all.A pool that doesn't even last a summer, what a let down, and a waste of money!"
1,Couldn't even set it up...,"We bought this product from another chain of stores. My recommendation would be to save your money. The ground underneath it has to be completely level underneath or it won't fill up correctly. We were going to get sand or soil to level out the ground underneath, but the directions stated, in bold print, not to do this. I guess it's some hazard. My advice would be to make sure the ground in your back yard is COMPLETELY level before purchasing. We spent three hours trying to set it up and could never get it to work."
3,Not the same size,This pool is fun I got this for my 11 month old my fiance and I measured it and it is not 12 x 36 it is 10 x 28 and it is set up right and all water is in it. But this is a fun pool to lounge around in
2,Junk,I would not recommend this pool to anyone. It was a very poor investment and the customer care was deplorable.
1,I don't recomend it,"I bought this easy set pool 2 wks ago and i finally decided to get it ready, when i started everything it was going well until the water started to rise then the pool started going to the side and it was a mess my point is that it says easy to set yeah right. I dont recomend this to anyone. Thank you."
3,hmm,"it was a great pool that my son, my husband and I could all get into comfortably...it's a pain to set up and take down, though. We don't have it anymore, though, and are in the market for another one. Maybe we shouldn't have let 5 of our fat friends in it and it wouldn't have been killed...food for thought."
1,Best of Three Dog Night anthology disc is way better!,I have some of all these songs on my other 3 Dog Night disc. But I think the rest of these tunes on this ultimate collection is new to me because I don't have them all and I nevered listened to these tracks so anyhow I recommend The Best of collection instead!
1,Right on,The previous writer nailed it. This is far from a 5 star movie. It is just violence laced with a dash of social commentary to make the film maker feel better about himself
3,Limited,"As another reviewer said, the furniture selections are very limited and fairly lame in appearance. That includes lamps, rugs, accessories etc, too. You will not be able to duplicate a space that you see in the design magazines, but you will be able to get a general idea of what your space will look like in terms of color combinations and furniture arrangement. The object selections are just not comprehensive enough. The software is fairly stable, but slow ( I am using a 1.7ghz computer with almost 1 gb of memory). The camera controls are awkward, but usable. For painting, there are many colors to choose from and its easy to show different combinations. Floor plan layout is good. I did not need to get precise, so I do not know how it would hold up in a more serious application.This could be 5 star software if the object library was made more comprehensive and the camera controls were more user friendly."
4,Excellent Product for the Price!,"We are remodeling our kitchen and bathroom and we bought this so we could make better decisions before we drop big bucks and start knocking down walls. Our architect put together schematics and a cardboard model but Interior Designer brought it to a new level by giving us a full color 3D view of the end result.Interior Designer makes it incredibly easy to layout the walls, add doors, windows, and fixtures. It's super easy to click and drag cabinets, refrigerators, and other appliances into the design.The product is not perfect - there are some constraints that make it difficult to place appliances where they barely fit or add custom geometry that's outside the bounds of normal designs - but for $50 I think this is an incredible product.Using interior designer, we got a MUCH better feel for our finished remodel. Well worth the price."
4,"Good software and fun, too","I have not spent tons of time working with the program yet, but have done enough to know that the learning curve is reasonable if you are somewhat publishing program literate. It has lots of potential for aiding in visualizing what your project will look like finished. If you are willing to invest some time to learn the program features, it performs as promised."
1,NEVER ABLE TO USE IT - GETTING A REFUND,"Better Homes and Gardens Interior Designer [OLD VERSION] I was excited to get this product because I am going to be doing some painting, floors, furniture, etc., in a bedroom. I was anxious to get an idea of room layout and furniture placement to get a visual of the project before I begin. It never brought up the registration page or let me indicate the CD Key. Consequently, I couldn't get the updates, etc. Amazon is very good about letting me return this product for a refund, but I am VERY disappointed."
4,Nice value for money,"This is a nice product, require very little training. Choices for furniture and appliances are less but good enough to give you the idea.Drawing curved stairs has limits only few options are there.Customer service is good and received email response within 12 h.If you want to draw in metric units (m, cm) you have to start the plan as metric and cannot convert inch to cm units once the plan is drawn!"
2,Very Frustrating,"I tried to use this product in order to create some visualizations for our kitchen redesign. After sepnding a lot of frustrating time learning the product and building up the room dimensions, doors, etc... I found that the library is EXTREMELY limited in terms of the types of sinks, ranges, etc... you can put in. The result it it is worthless for actually visualizing what appliances, cabinet colors, etc... would look like. The product may be fine for laying out rooms and the like but I would have expected a version called ""interior designer"" to have a *much* greater selection of objects to be even mildly useful. I'm returning it if I can."
2,Not usable as intended,"I tried to like this product. As previous reviews have said it has significant design limitations. If you only need a 2D floorplan there are better tools for the same money or less. The object libraries that come with the tool - furniture, fabrics, etc. - are really lame. This limits it's value as an interior design tool. I did not attempt to return it so I cannot comment on their return policy."
2,Ambicon GPS pro,I purchased this product for use treking. The gps unit using the built in antenna will not pickup more than 1 satellite . This does not give a fix. The unit is not usable using the built in antenna. If I connect the external with the 8 foot cord the unit works good (tracks 5 or more satellites and gives a very good fix. (22 feet cep) I can use the device if I velcro the antenna to the top of my hat but then I have an 8 foot cord dangling. Ambicom tech support suggests laying the Pocket-pc with the gps unit on the ground and waiting 2 minutes. Results no better.
2,Dated but some good insights for the inexperienced coach.,"The pictures are as old as can be (canvas hightops, short shorts, and not a glass backboard in sight) and the diagrams are hand drawn and somewhat basic. Can be a good starting book for a coach who has not played the game."
5,"A ""Must Have"" book for anyone who wants to work at home!","Who needs a personal business coach when you can buy this book? When it comes to starting and maintaining a home business Kristie Tamsevicius has been there, done that, loves it, and wants to help others do the same. I love the practical help that this book provides, especially the checklists. I also appreciated the many questions that the book included to help me think through a multitude of planning and implementation issues. Every time I thought, ""I wonder if this book covers..."" I found what I needed. If the only items this book contained were the business plan section and web resources listed at the end it would be well worth the price, but there's so much more. If you want to start a business at home this is the book you need."
5,Wanna work from Home? Read this book!,"Kristie's book is a great resource for anyone thinking about creating their own home-based business. Her book is easy to follow and full of advice that is universal to anyone pursuing a stay-at-home career, not just moms. I highly recommend this book as your one stop shop resource for a successful home-based business."
5,A great idea,"I like this book and especially the title of the book because first of all, it's difficult being a stay-at-home mom and secondly, coming up with brilliant ideas on how to make money while staying at home is an inspiration for me."
4,An Ok PPV,"The Buried Alive Match was ok, but could have been much better and Mankind and The Rock wasn't one of their better matches either. Overall, this ppv is pretty good but I would rent it!"
1,IT DIDNT WORK WE BUY NEW IT DIE ON ME DON.T BUY IT,THE VHS WE BUY DID NOT WORK THE MATCHS WERE BORING TOO BORING I KNOW DON.T HOW WWF CAN HAVE A BAD PPV BUT THEY CAN WE BUY NEW IT WAS SO NEW BUT IT DIE ON ME DON.T BUY THIS ON VHS THIS VHS WAS NEW BUT DIDNT PLAY I HAVE NOT SEEN ALL OF THE PPV BUT WHAT I HAVE SEEN IT DIDNT PLAY GOOD NOT GOOD AT ALL IF YOU WANT TO WATCH IT GET ON DVD THAT ALL HAVE TO SAY DON.T BUY THE VHS IF YOU WANT A GOOD PPV BUY HELL IN THE CALL 2012 THAT ONE GOOD i was not happy to have a vhs i buy not work not happy at all it was too old to play good it woods not work i was sad when it did.nt work i woods not buy a wwf vhs for a 2 time the ppv was poor not that fun to watch it the wwf and a bad ppv i want to see a good wwf ppv i seen somes the ppv it was not that awesome or cool zoey jackson out don.t buy this the vhs may not work that all i have to say about this review hope this help you review by zoey jackson see all my reviews
1,A very weak card,I can't recommend this video at all. Mark Henry/Dlo Brown vs. Val Venis/Godfather was a decent start but the match was really short. The Headbangers/Oddities match was pure crap. Owen Hart vs. Steve Blackman was solid but had a cheap ending that made Owen look weak in his home country. The Brood vs. Job Squad 6 man tag was very good and a definite match of the night. The Goldust vs. JJ match was decent but nothing special. The tag title match just flat out sucked. The world title match between The Rock and Mankind had some good action but the really cheap ending that made no sense ruined it. The main event which was the buried alive match between Austin and Undertaker turned out to be beyond horrible.Do not buy this video. It might be worth a rental for a few of the matches but that's it.
3,just rent it,the only matches that stand out are the buried alive match with austin and undertaker. the rock and mankind match was ok to. and the outlaws vs. shamrock and bossman was average. but the rest were all boring.
2,Could Have Been MUCH better,"I was very disapointed. THe first Buried Alive Match with Mankind and Undertaker was way better than this one. It is worth renting but not worth buying. The Rock and Mankind could have done a way better job. It was too unrealistic with Austin bringing out the machine and undertaker waiting in the grave while Austin was trying to get the dirt in. It had great potential, but it stunk."
5,Purple martin book,"The book is very informative, to the point, and easy to read. I intend to use its applications next year at our northern Michigan vacation home."
1,Poor quality,"Save your money, if leaves lint on the lens. It left my camera worse than before I used it. I had to spend 60 bucks and get it cleaned at a repair shop."
4,Great product if....,"... you take your time and are not afraid of touching your sensor. If you are not confident in your skills then I would suggest sending it in to get it ""professionally"" cleaned.I don't buy into the hype that I need to send my camera in to get a sensor clean or bring it into a local camera shop. In all honesty I trust myself more than some guy who is working at these places. As long as you take your time and take the necessary precautions you should not have any issue cleaning your sensor.This kit produces excellent results with no wait time on having to ship your camera to and from a service and at a fraction of the cost."
4,Great for travel.,"More useful on lenses than the sensor, as the swabs don't exactly clear the sensor as easily as the ad claims. That being said, the cleaning solution is great and the pads truly are lint-free. I keep one in my photo kit wherever I travel. Compressed air makes everything even easier, so don't forget to get a Rocket or a few cans. Just FYI."
1,Literally expensive garbage,"The plastic swab bends and skips across the sensor, the cloths leave all kinds of crap behind. This was frustrating and pointless, and a serious waste of money. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Just take your camera to a shop and have it cleaned. I used about 10 cloths just trying to get the residue and lint from the previous cloths off the sensor. I cannot emphasize this enough, it is really just expensive garbage. Do not buy it."
1,Lint Free?,"The ""lint free"" cloths do nothing but leave lint behind. It has left my sensor worse than before. The type 3 kit also does not fit the D7000, you will have to cut the plastic swabs. But still I rush delivered and ended up making it worse after watching many videos on how to properly do this."
3,who so expensive!!!!,"for a little liquid with single use swabs, cmon why overpriced....but it does get the job done. i use it for my canon 5d."
2,I just couldn't read this.,"Maybe I'm retarded, but this is a tough book for me to read. I have a basic knowledge of set theroy, but I couldn't get through chapter two of this book.This book just blazes through stuff. Its proofs use as little writing as possible, which makes understanding the stuff more difficult. It takes me about 10 minutes to understand one sentence. At that rate it would probably take me 20 years to finish the book. You need to be part of a very, very special audience to enjoy this book. Get this only if your IQ is close to 200.Hey, at least the price ain't bad compared to other college textbooks."
4,Which version of American Pie does this come with?,"Great movies, but which version of American Pie does this 2 pack come with? The unrated or rated version?"
5,"A clear, empathetic guide","A well-organized book, combining current scientific thinking with helpful suggestions and anecdotes. Plenty of meat in the text, but the time-challenged will find chapter reviews and appendices useful."
4,Great book for parents or themselves,"The moment I started reading this book, I knew my husband was ADD. It was not a surprise. Thanks to this book we found ways for him to concentrate and focus. Like, now he knows he can watch TV and read a book at the same time and focus and remember the reading better than ever. I will recommend this book to every parent that think they have a child with ADD or any adult, including themselves that may have ADD... Read it and enjoy it. There is good information in this book."
5,More than pleased!,"I received the product promptly (within 3-4 days). It was packaged well and undamaged. Upon opening the package, the charger works great and I am able to use my cell phone again. I'm very satisfied!"
5,"Quality, information and soul from start to finish","This book is writing and publishing at its very best. Author Jeff Taylor writes with gusto about gardening tools and with delicacy about life. He is a master at making connections between simple tools and wisdom. I found this book riveting and calming at the same time. The humor is gentle, subtle. The syntax is graceful. The photos by Rich Iwasaki are of equal quality, rich in color and perspective. This is the perfect gift for the thoughtful and erudite gardener."
2,"Great songs, lousy video","Miscellaneous newsreel and performance film clips are presented, with popular music from the World War II era. You cannot fault the outstanding songs here, but the presentation and sound is terrible. Artists and songs are not identified until the end credits, and the entire film has a cheap quality to it."
1,Outdated item...,"With HDMI the industry standard for transmitting digital A/v... this old PDA-5002 is ancient history. Search Amazon for ""HDFury"" and order a HDFury2 or HDFury3 to convert your HDMI signal from your Blu-Ray or HD-Cable box into a component (YPbPr) or RGB signal which these older (but still gorgeous picture quality) Pioneer plasmas will accept. This will breathe new life into this fantastic old Pioneer plasmas, that only have component or RGB video inputs for 1080i signals.Cheers,Doc Rings"
1,Priority Planner,I was disappointed in the Priority Planner. I was expecting something more for my money than this. It has not been usefuly to me and I would recommend anyone to save their money and buy a ream of paper and make your own planner to your specifications on your computer.
5,KYB 344263 GR-2 Shock,The KYB 344263 GR-2 Shocks were a very good value at $17.99 each. My 2000 Chevy Tahoe Z71 Tahoe rides much better now.
5,This album is the best one out there,I absolutely love this album. The songs on here are great because they are a mixture of slow sentamental songs and upbeat kick off your shoes and dance songs. I will never get sick of listening to this cd because I have listened to it already over a hundred times. It's the best.
5,does the job,It does the job and is dishwasher safe. The black enamel disguises the charring unlike the stainless models. I've only had it for a month but if feels durable and built to last for at least a couple of seasons of heavy use.
2,98121 GrillPro Porcelain Coated Square Wok Topper,This Wok is the perfect size for use on my Grill however I have issues with the quality of the Wok itself. The Porcelain was chipped where the handle's rivet onto the Wok so I returned it and the second one was chipped as well. GrillPro has an obvious manufacturing problem. I decided to keep the second Wok because I didn't want to mess with yet another return. This event does however spark doubts about GrillPro's quality control and so I'll be reluctant to purchase their brand again.
5,Quality product,"I have used this wok style grill topper on my Weber charcoal for a couple of years. I find that the porcelain enamel to be the best for high heat, non-stick, and food safety. I have had other ""non-stick"" coated grill accessories - they were garbage - coating wore off. The enamel on GrillPro items is of high quality and with a little cooking spray, releases food easily. I prefer it over stainless. This company has flat toppers, too. I have them and use them, too.I use the wok style mostly for grilling veggies that need a little shaking around from time to time.I found the products at my Ace Hardware."
5,Cuts are good,"I replaced the blade that came with my table saw with this item. It cuts so much better. I was surprised by the difference in the speed of the cut. I would definitely recommend this saw to any one looking for a replacement. I am using the blade to cut 3/4"" birch plywood."
1,Rough cutting blade,"Tried cutting several different woods with this blade, soft, hard, plywood, etc..., all were left with a terribly rough edge along the cut line. Maybe I'll turn it into a wall clock because it's worthless for cutting wood !"
4,an introduction to the world of julius knipl,"This book is where it all begins. Strange, beautiful stories that make you take notice of the aspects of the world that you might miss. Required reading if you have ever lived in New York. -yakov"
5,Great for Boat Storage,"It's been nearly one year and everything stored in these boxes,which sit in a damp environment on my boat have remained like brand new."
1,SUPERCRUISE,"Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerfull than a locomotive, able to do the most invinceble way out things ever. No bullet can hit this man, yet he never misses. Look up on the screen, is it a bird , is it a plane not its Supercruise.What a load of rubbish and waste of time this movie was."
1,"Awful, unbelievable and boring to boot!","This movie was terrible. From the cheesy lines to the lack of chemistry between Cruise and Diaz (which I found ironic considering the good chemistry they had in ""Vanilla Sky""), to the totally unbelievable action scenes, to the terribly unoriginal script, and finally to Cruise's face which is ironically starting to look more and more like that Vanilla Sky mask he wore. The only saving grace to the film was the decent-looking stunt work, but this is lost in all the other issues of the movie and doesn't warrant anything over 1-star.FINAL GRADE: D"
2,"Definitely Mindless, but not much fun","If you don't care about plot or good writing but big action scenes and a lot of full screen head shots of Tom Cruise are all you need, then you might enjoy this film.I walked away thinking it could have been so much more, but seemed to happily settle for mediocre.But maybe that's just me."
3,Silly triffle,"What kind I say? It's more cute than smart. Cruise almost playing against type and Cameron putting on her best ditzy thing. It moves along. It's cool. It's stupid. Don't buy it, rent it. Or wait until it comes on cable (or whatever)"
3,Entertaining....but San Fermin Festivities in Spain??? Where did that come from?,"The movie is entertaining, and you will like it if you are not looking for a masterpiece. It's OK to watch at home, but would not have payed to watch it in the theater.Also,I'm from Spain, specifically from Pamplona, a small city in the north where the real San Fermin festivities take place. It was annoying to see that in the movie they place the San Fermin in the middle of Seville.Misinformation or ignorance?? I believe that movie producers should get better informed about what they are depicting in their films."
4,Good story,"The story was good. The computer generated action scenes reminded me of the first Mission Impossible. Why you ask. Because in real life they would be impossible. That's why it is a movie. Great fun, lot's of action, good ending."
2,Should have been a spoof on action romantic comedies,"I think you were supposed to be endeared to the characters and therefor not mind the lack of reality. We never felt connected to the characters and just started laughing at one point when Tom Cruise walked across a room or courtyard with all sorts of guns being shot at him. He, of course, doesn't get hit, but does shoot in one shot everyone he aims at. I think they wanted a movie that would appeal to men and women, but got neither."
4,"Tom Cruise, as always!","I bought it and it really arrived on time. :-) I watched it...and of course, it's tom cruise! so there was a a lot of mystery, gun shots and car chase! Cameron's role was funny and sweet. I liked the views of their various locations. Austria, spain, etc... I think this movie is cute but in my opinion, Jack Reacher is better than this. :-)"
4,Enjoyable,"What a fun movie! It's old fashioned fun in it's way. No swearing, no nudity, no sex, no bloody scenes, just well thought out dialogue between the characters. I'm not generally a fan of the stars but I love their characters in this movie. It's fun, smart, and funny. So what if it's not believable, neither is Lord of the Rings. I don't always watch movies to be educated or to think about complex subjects. If you're looking for a good time, this is one."
4,Fun,I have watched several times- reminds me alittle bit of Mr. and Mrs. Smith. I guess I would call it silly - glad to not have bad language and moderate with the sensual - no sex scenes.
4,Campy fun!,"I really enjoyed this fun, campy movie about a wonderfully polite spy and the girl who meets him. Laughed out loud thru much of the movie. That doesn't happen to me very often. Give it a try but don't take it seriously."
5,the best action comedy movie of the year,"This is fun from start to finish -- it made tarantino's list of top 20 movies of the year -- it is so good in every way. If you want to escape, have fun, be smiling and laughing and get your cup of action in your movie --- you cannot get any better than knight and day. Tom Cruise is amazing and Cameron Diaz is superb. This movie if Fox's number one movie of 2010 worldwide. If you have ever liked tom cruise before, give him another chance-- you will not regret it."
4,Love this movie... but extended version doesn't add much.,"I think the theatrical version of this movie is much under-rated. It's fun and there is a great deal of chemistry between Cruise and Diaz. The script is sharp and moves along with few mis-steps. While it doesn't break a ton of new ground it's solid fun with some clever and memorable set pieces of action and dialog. (Personally i think the 'haters' just want to dis Cruise, who, aside from his personal world, if he is given his due, is still one of the best actors around these days... sorry 'haters'.) There is a reason that they shot a lot of film and scenes that get left on the cutting room floor. They just don't add to the story... and that's the case here. I give the original 4, so I'm giving this 4 just not to be misleading it's really 3.5. Watch the original with a big bowl of popcorn... and have fun. Here's wishing they would follow this up with 'Day and Knight'. I'd buy a ticket. (Heck, I'd write it.)"
4,Night and Day.,"This one you can watch night or day, either way it is a good movie. Lots of action. A good actor and a good actress. Some surprises throughout the movie to make the plot. One you will enjoy, get this one for your collection. To enjoy when you want too."
4,Good comedy and action,Good action and we got some good laughs in too. I recommend this if you are in the mood for action with a bit of humor.
2,Purely unrealistic fluff,"This movie was so bad, I had to stop watching it after 30 minutes. Neither Cruise's nor Diaz's character is at all believable, and the plot, revolving around an everlasting battery, is so far-fetched that I couldn't suspend my disbelief. Glad I didn't see this at the theater.Were I not from Kansas, by way of Boston, I'd give it one star. As is, I'll give it the extra star because I recognized quite a few of the location shots."
2,Sub-par,"Wild mildly entertaining, the not quite fully developed plot, sub-par dialogue, and a few miserable special effects really killed this movie. In addition to this, Cruise was endowed with superb tactical abilities the majority of the time and was second-rate at others. All-in-all it was a bit cheesy - certainly far less than you would expect given its cast."
4,Great travel scenes!,"This is a fun action/romantic/suspense movie BUT what I loved most was the travel: Cameron Diaz falls asleep in one place, then wakes up on a train in the Alps, then she and Tom Cruise hit a tropical island, then they wind up in Seville. What fun!! Cameron and Tom are eye candy, but the landscapes are fun also. This movie made me book my trip to Spain in December. Ole."
2,Mission Impossible for one man,"For some reason, some actors cannot get outside of certain genres. And so it seems with Tom Cruise and the secret agent / good-guy renegade flicks. With Mission Impossible, Top Gun, Minority Report in tow, his latest action flick is along the same plot lines. Here he plays a renegade FBI agent who has gone outside the law to protect his charge, and picks up a tag-along along the way, played by Cameron Diaz. What follows is a lot of car chases, shoot-outs, fist-fights, rooftop escapes, and various other action scenes that seem a rehash of his previous action films. All in all, I'm glad I saw this on video and not in the theater."
3,"3 1/2 stars for a pleasant, funny action film","Wouldn't have made a lot more sense to actually name the two leads Knight and Day? Instead they are Miller and Havens and we spend too much time trying to figure out how the title came about. Yes, I get the Knight part. Now this isn't Oscar worthy stuff and it's unlikely to make a Top 10 or even Top 25 list, but I will admit to having a good time. The film is filled with all the car chases, stunts and action you could want but it's all pretty predictable and repeatable. And there's no sex, although seeing Cameron Diaz stuffed into a red bikini has its draw. Still, Tom Cruise shows his funny, cool charm and Cameron Diaz is a real hoot. I liked it."
3,Effectively and joyously ridiculous,"Effectively and joyously ridiculous. Cruise plays the unflappably cool spy with aplomb. Diaz plays the the girl caught in his wake with verve and humor. Amazingly, they make this ridiculous, delirious movie work. The CGI bulls, on the other hand; if you can't do it well, leave it out. They were obviously no threat to the actors but they did serious damage to the movie."
4,Predictable but entertaining,Every part of this film was predictable from the beginning. Most of the best parts were in the previews for the film. Most of these films are very predictable though. I was still entertained by it. Just have to watch this wanting to be entertain not intellectually stimulated.
3,"Cruise was Great, Cameron was Fine","I was so over Tom Cruise and then I saw this movie where he feels like a crazy person which fits with his persona right now but then he turns out to be a big action hero and super spy who isn't crazy at all. The action in this movie is really big, much bigger than the commercials showed and goes over the top a lot which I liked. The only downside was Cameron Diaz who was fine but didn't really do anything for the whole movie. I never thought her character was all that interesting and she's the main one. I think a more engaging actress would have really turned this into a classic movie, maybe Reese Witherspoon and Tom Cruise of ten years ago."
1,Bad Two Years In A Row,"My wife and I watched this over New Year's Eve. It was so bad it will take another two years before I can watch another Tom Cruise movie. I cannot believe this got 4 stars...who are you people??? Instead of paying bills like one reviewer did during this movie, I tried to clean out my inbox and watched a movie on iTunes and just let this one run on. Don't waste your time, especially not over a holiday."
3,Fell somewhat short of its potential,"Started out strong but lost its wind and by the third act barely crawled over the finish line. Cruise is shaping into a fine comedic actor who seems to have no problem making fun of his own image as an ""invulnerable"" action hero. He and Diaz have workable chemistry and the supporting actors and locations were great. My only real complaint for what was otherwise a light hearted Summer date movie is the inconsistent pacing and its failure to deliver what could have been a terrific black comedy. The first half was very similar to ""True Lies"" and had a lot of the same charm. The last half swerved off into conventional action movie fare.OTOH, I think this is a good route for Cruise. Like ""The Governator"" Arnold, you can only be an action hero so long before you become a caricature. Arnold made the jump to making fun of himself before it was too late. Cruise seems to be going that way as well (Tropic Thunder). Maybe there is hope for Stalone?"
1,They tricked me!,"I can't believe I downloaded this. I was thinking it was the real movie.. that's what happens when you go off the picture of the product, rather than the title."
1,stupid - just a trailer,Stupid selection available - just a trailer - who wants to watch a trailer only - I was interested in seeing the movie!
2,"Campy and Fun, but Little Substance","I personally felt the movie was average, at best. I enjoyed it for what it was, and thought it was quite entertaining and amusing, but far from the intelligence that some of Cruise's older movies held (Minority Report, Mission Impossible). The plot seemed very mechanic, by the numbers formula. When Cruise's character finally reveals the details, there was no ""wow"" moment. In fact, I was disappointed, since I had come to expect something a bit more political and intriguing. And here I thought ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" was nothing to root about either, but that movie seemed to make more sense than this one. All in all, it was fun to sit through once, but not much more than that."
1,In Character with Tom Cruise & Cameron Diaz,It was a disappointment. I was expecting a movie and not just a review. Will watch the fine print better from now on
1,Plot? Did the writers have a plot in mind?,"This movie is terrible and boring. While I enjoy a good action film every now and again…this didn’t work for me. To enjoy a movie like this, you must suspend your disbelief long enough to enjoy what is happening on the screen. The terrible writing, poor character development and weak plot didn’t allow me to ignore the laws of nature long enough to enjoy the silliness on the screen. The action scenes were dry and the film brought nothing new to the action silver-screen. Add to that the sophomoric dialogue between the two main characters and we have a major mess on our hands. Sorry Tom and Cameron but you should have said “no” to this script. And I should have said ""no"" to my friend who asked to rent it."
2,An action movie with little plot,"This is a sort of Jason Bourne meets Mission Impossible directed by Tom Mangold. Roy Miller (Tom Cruise) is a CIA agent who is trying to clear his name. He literally bumps into June Havens (Cameron Diaz), who refurbishes old automobiles, in an airport lounge and they board a plane together. The plane is deserted apart from half a dozen villains who are out to kill Miller. The villains include the pilot and co-pilot. When they attack Miller, he kills them all while Havens is in the rest-room and he is forced to land the plane in a cornfield. While Havens wants to get away from Miller, he is trying to keep her with him for her own protection. The FBI are after Miller and think that Havens is now his accomplice. There's lots of action, but little plot and mediocre acting. I'm not surprised the film had a very difficult gestation!! I don't know why they bothered."
2,"Boring, could not connect with characters",Either poor casting or poor character development left me looking for more. I could not connect with the characters or get into the story.
1,waste of time.,"Zero story, Zero actionIf Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz are not in this movie, this movie may not even get released."
1,Knight and Day,Video Did Not Download.I was still charged $4.95 This is not my first Amazon download so I know it is not my system.
3,Good Movie BUT..The Blu-ray disc would not play!!!,"My title says it all!The Blu-ray disc would not play. It showed the typical warning about who to contact if there were any problems but then after that nothing.The DVD disc played fine.4 days later... Finally was able to watch and enjoy the movie itself. It was quiet good. Fast paced lots of action no time for romantic filler. No real bloodshed or language. (Could be shown on the Disney Channel unedited.) At one point the story even had me wondering if what I was watching was actually happening or was it really a ""Beautiful Mind"" moment in June's mind?"
2,Knight and Day.....I think not.,"I will only say this. Tom Cruise what were you thinking? This movie is really, really bad. Let's hope Tom will redeem himself with the new M:I movie. As an actor you are so much better, then making crappy movies."
2,Brainless regurgitation of action and romantic comedy,If I could get past all the dumb scenes in this movie (there was a lot) I might have liked it. They should have just left well enough alone and made Vanilla Sky their last movie together.
4,Good fun,"If you looking to just enjoy a movie good on action you will enjoy ""Knight and Day."" I didn't go into this looking for any deep plots lines because it wasn't suppose to be that type of movie. I also saw it on Amazon VOD so I may not judge it the same as I would if I had payed for a full priced theater ticket. I still enjoyed the movie and would recommend a view."
4,In Character,"A shorty of an interview and how-we-did-it film, which gives the idea that the movie was fun to do for the actors."
2,"The movie was fun, but Amazon video streaming was not","Light action adventure spoof. Acted broadly and lightheartedly. Excellent chase and action scenes. As usual, Amazon streaming video failed, with many frustrating interruptions. Other providers do this better--in fact, that is the only way we were able to finish viewing the movie."
1,Knight and Day in character,It was a waste of time. Was looking for the actual movie which was good on the big screen. Felt it was a little deceiving listing
3,Disappointing until second half of movie,"I was surprised how slow moving this is. However, half way through to the end were good. Wish they could have started it out that way also. Would I buy the DVD or watch again?NO."
4,Cruise Cruises in Silly Spy Spoof,This is a cute sort of spy movie where Tom Cruise is a spy and Cameron Diaz stumbles into the adventure. Cruise plays his part so well in this tongue-in-cheek adventure that I could not help laughing. Diaz does a nice job as the naive leading lady in film and the action keeps the adventure rolling. This is the kind of film I could watch over and over for a good chuckle.Add a star if you are not overly critical and not too serious.
5,Great Fun!,"This film is crazy-funny and we have watched it several times, because it's so much fun. We were happy to find it at AmazonKnight and Day (Single-Disc Edition)and we bought it for ourselves and as gifts after seeing it on TV. The performances of both Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz are 5 stars! Anyone who can suspend seriousness while watching ""spies"" shoot it out will have a very good time! We recommend it to anyone who enjoys great comic performances."
4,fun movie,"This movie is simply a fun, light hearted action-romance. Don't expect more than that out of it, and you will enjoy the movie."
4,"Fun movie, plenty of action","Like many here, I didn't expect to like this movie, but I did. It's a bit predictable, but I wasn't expecting ""Casablanca"" or ""Gone with the Wind,"" right? I enjoyed seeing Tom Cruise in a role that kind of made fun of his M:I roles. This was very much a comedy, but there was still a lot of action. It also had a bit of the feel of ""True Lies"" in that Cameron Diaz' character, like Jamie Lee Curtis', is drawn into the spy world with little to no preparation. (There's even a shoot-out in a warehouse like ""True Lies."") Anyway, it's fun, it's funny, and it's entertaining. If spy action comedy is what your'e looking for, this is a good choice."
4,not bad,"fun action movie, doesn't really deserve 5 stars, but I still enjoyed it. The love story with-in the movie was very stylish. There are definitely times when it borders on the impossible or unbelievable, but that's what attracts us to movies in the first place I think. Nice work Ms. Diaz & Mr. Cruise."
4,A Fun Romp,"Though there were no real surprises, and this has all been done innumerable times before, it was still pulled off in a very entertaining way. The two stars have enough chemistry to make for a good ride.The action is over the top, of course, and there is no doubt that Tom and Cameron will get together in the end. As for the plot, it has enough twists and turns to keep things interesting.This movie was never intended to be anything more than an entertaining thrill ride, and I think it succeeded. There were just a few times when things just didn't seem right, mostly with some of Tom's actions (I won't go into details here). Still, those were minor quibbles.As for plot holes and logic? I don't watch these type movies to go that deep into analysis and motive, so I'll leave that to the more analytical crowd.As for me, I had a great time watching it and highly recommend it."
4,So Much Better Than Expected,"My friend and I went to this movie because the one we wanted to see was sold out. Since I am not a Tom Cruise fan I was not expecting much. We then spent the entire movie laughing and felt it was worth every penny. There are times when you don't want to be mentally challenged and just want to be entertained in an adult manner. This is exactly what this movie does. I have gotten to the point that I don't read critic's reviews. Instead I look at the ratings that the public gives a movie and comparing it with the critic's ratings. If they are about the same you can be sure it is either good or bad depending on the ratings. If however the critics rating is lousy and the public's is good, you can pretty much assume that the critics are panning the movie because they are afraid to admit that sometimes entertainment can be good without being high art. Enjoy."
3,Cute,"If you are looking for a realistic thriller, this is not the movie for you. But if you enjoy unlikely situations, a little fun poked at traditional spy movies, and some mild twists, then this is definately something you want to see. Some of the other reviewers didn't like it because of how silly and fantastical it was, but if they had bothered to do any research at all they would have realized that wasn't the point.I highly recommend it if you are looking for amusement, but don't bother if you are looking to be transported away into a world of Bond intrigue."
4,"Fun, good time movie","Is a very fun, entertaining movie. Was def better than I expected. I would def recommend anyone to at least check it out. I got a great price and a speedy delivery too."
5,I love the Movie,it good Movie it plays good . My kids just look the movie a lot!!! I fill like it was one of the best movie out there!!
3,could not finish,"I am not a critic, but boy oh boy this was bad, so very bad, it is very seldom i can not finish a movie, buut i had to turn this off."
1,It stinks! It really does.,"If you are into clichés and pretty bad acting and direction you're gonna have a ball! Never felt so terrible inside for seeing a movie. For waaaay cooler spies and real/relevant use of comedy/action/drama try watching ""Burn Notice"" TV series. Seriously, don't waste your time on this even if you aren't a pseudo-movie critic for that matter. That's just bad cinema. Really expensive and sad garbage."
1,HATED IT !,My Brother told me about this one we do have different taste in movies he loved it i hated it. Just hate phony car crashes and stunts just not possible or believable....horrible plot so much more wrong with this movie big waste but i said enough...
1,Stupid and incoherent,"Senseless plot. Besides that, the action was periodically stopped by choppy editing. Nice stunts. Cameron in a bikini was good eye candy, but even that was chopped down. Too bad."
1,Don't Waste Your time,"At the very least, action movies shouldn't be boring. But, this one was. Not much of a plot either. The actors try to be funny, but it really never works."
2,Knight and Day,"A disappointing action-comedy that had potential of being a really good movie. The movie stars three good actors, but the movie just left you bored at times and felt like they kept repeating themselves. The movie wasn't a movie you'd wanna watch over and over. It's just not that good."
1,A let down!,"I'll be honest in that I didn't watch the entire movie. I was really excited to see it, but it ended up being a complete letdown. The characters had no backstory and were not interesting. Cameron Diaz's character is drugged 3 times in the first hour of the movie. Even Peter Sarsgaard who always finds a way to make his characters interesting wasn't enough to make me want to finish the movie. Skip this one!"
4,fun,"Just watched Knight and Day on DVD last night. If you want a serious film, don't bother. If you are looking for something fun, witty with a story to kick back and just enjoy the ride, this is one I recommend. Plan to buy the DVD now."
3,knight,"It was an OK movie, entertainment is all. I would not have bought it if I had seen it before hand"
4,A good mixture of humor and drama,"In this comedic adventure tale, a secret agent discovers that his superiors want to kill him. He takes a plane to his destination, but they or some others know about it and do not allow anyone on the plane other than a woman they think he is somehow involved with, even though he apparently only met her. The agent kills all of the many people on the plane that try to kill him, including the pilots, and the plane crashes. He leaves the woman, who is arrested by the FBI, who want to find the agent. It turns out that he is carrying a battery that everyone wants to get, the woman repeatedly does flakey things that get her in trouble and he needs to rescue her, and the agent and the woman fall in love. People who like their dramas without comedy will dislike the film, but others with a dual sense of humor and adventure will enjoy it."
4,"Off the wall Spy and Girl next door,",I have yet to watch the this movie. I gave this movie to my dad for Christmas. He has since watched it in the same week. He really liked it. I don't think he's laughed that much in a long time.
3,"Works fine, looks awful","I ordered this as brand new but the disc looks like a long-nailed dog tap danced on it. It plays perfectly fine on any DVD player, but ""brand new"" does not mean ""used and then repackaged."""
1,"Awful, Unbelievable, 2 Hours I'll never get back.",Un realistic from the start. This movie is awful. Glad I rented for 99 cents. Anything more I would have really felt bad spending the money on this waste of time.
1,next,"This film is just not what I expected from 2 great people. The guts is not there to move you to stop, watch and enjoy it. I wish the plot could have taken me to the end sooner as I lost interest and wanted the film to end. The picture of the 2 actors on the promo depicts it all.....they both have NO IDEA who they are shooting or what the are doing.... I wish Knight and day was listed as Night and stay away!The END."
1,Stunningly Retarded,"This is the first movie I've reviewed on Amazon, but this one was so bad that I just felt compelled to offer my opinion. The plot holes were about 10 miles wide. The dialog was painful."
1,Didn't even finish the movie,"I enjoy both Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz very much so I thought this would be an entertaining movie to rent for a Saturday night. One hour into it, I wondered why I was still watching it. Fortunately, thanks to the inane dialog, impossible situations and stupid plot line, when I switched it off I fell asleep instantly."
1,Refused to play in my BD player,"This BD disc refused to play in my BD player. I have a late model Samsung player, and after quite a bit of delay after putting the disk in it came up with a message from 20th Century Fox (the studio) saying I needed an update to my player software. My player software is current, and it plays all other BD disks I put in it. Beware!"
1,Save your Money,"I saw this movie in the theaters, to my ever lasting regret.Normaly Cameron and Tom do good in there movies but in this one they both bombed.Tom is the typical bad ass secret agent with a heart of gold, Camerion is a typical dumb blond who messes with cars.In a nut shell there is this battery, inventer of the battery and the chick cought in the middle.He uses her as a muel to get the battery on a plane, kidnapps her, she falls for him, he falls for her.In the end they end up together."
2,Didn't thrill,I wanted to like this movie because it was taped here in MA but I just couldn't get into it. Something just seemed off in it and I was glad when it was finished...especially glad I only spent .99 to download and watch it.
3,Boring,"I was hoping this would be a funny movie, its pretty far-fetched, unrealistic- not like many movies are but I got easily bored and could not wait for it to end."
5,Knight and Day,"This is a really great action packed romantic comedy. Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz are a good match, and I would like to see a sequel to this movie. It was great!oo"
3,Knight & Day,"I think the other 3 star reviews on this movie pretty much sum up how I felt about this movie.Its entertaining in its own way, but Knight & Day just feels like its missing something. The way the story was put together felt kind of bland. I know that when I go into a movie like this there are going to be some over the top things going on, but there are a couple of instances in Knight & Day when you just shake your head saying no way. Its amazing how they avoid bullets without even trying on a couple of occasions. I'm sure the bad guys aren't that bad with a gun. I think the comedic element to the movie was one of its strong points, but the way it all comes together leaves a unsatisfied feeling in the end."
3,"Entertaining, don't keep high expectation","After a crazy day at work, I was looking for a movie that would entertain me without having to use too much mind. And I found this. It was all that I expected of it. The plot was simple with lot of convenient loop-holes (which I expected and accepted). Tom Cruise looked older than ever and Cameron looked $exy as ever. The stunts, the dialogues, the ""missing"" chemistry between the lead pair - all just ""tied"" together.... but I have to admit still gave me ""now-what-is-happening-amazed"" tickles. Cameron's goofiness was enjoyable. Like I said, I didnt start with much so was not disappointed. You can watch the movie - make sure to switch your brain off. :)"
4,An okay bonus clip,"As a bonus clip, this is just okay. I mean, it is free so you can't be too demanding. But I wish it is a bit longer (this clip is only 5 minutes long). You don't gain much insight into the movie (which I have already seen and enjoyed). You hear Diaz and Tom Cruise talk about making the film, but it gives you a feeling of listening to soundbites rather than anything particularly insightful.If this clip were longer and provided more depth to the movie or the characters, I'd give it 5 stars. But it's still good."
3,Tom Cruise formula movie,"Great action but there are huge credibility gaps in many scenes. Too many to explsin, but it was like the director skipped logic when sequences could havc been filmed with easy transitional explanations."
3,Knight and Day just OK,"Knight and Day falls into the category of many movies that just don't live up to the preview. I was excited to see the movie because it looked like a great combination of humor and action. While the movie did give me a taste of both, it fell short of satisfying either expectation. I will say that Tom Cruise was great in this movie. I know that there are many Cruise haters out there, but I happen to be a fan of his, and felt that this movie a good showcase of his talent. The rest of the cast was good, but my biggest gripe about the movie(without revealing the plot)is that the movie does some fast forward sequences in several parts, and all that did was make me angry, because it seemed that those would have been the best parts to watch.Personally I would skip this movie, and reccomend watching either Collateral or The Smiths."
2,Don't bother,"A government agent and a woman cross paths, resulting in the two of them embarking on a mission to either protect or illegally sell a new form of energy production, depending on whom you believe to be on the right side of the law. A few too many coincidences prevent this from being a believable form of escapist summer entertainment, and the interaction between Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz is less than memorable."
5,"Been there, done that....But Now I have the book!","If you are a voice over talent, you will find things in this book that you never knew. You will also relate to times and events when you were in the studio and had difficult clients, like those that wanted you to 'punch-up' every word and more. Mr. Hogan has done a brilliant job of really putting all the cards on the table in this book. He shows what lengths a true ""gonna make it to the top or die trying"" attitude is needed to make your dreams of being an actor come true. His insight and writing style make you feel he is sitting across the table from you. The book is informative, intuitive, hilarious and a must have for any person, pro or wanna be, in the voice over acting field. I couldn't put it down! Thanks H2 for unselfishly sharing your talent and providing solid advice to be successful in our wonderful industry!Phil HannaTampabay, FL"
5,Wow!,"I've never known an ""instruction"" book to be a barn burner before but this is one of those books.I read it cover to cover in one sitting, then went back and read it again.I do voice-overs, I teach voice-overs and I continue to learn from the likes of Harlan Hogan..and I don't even know the guy.But, I'd like too."
5,Extremely entertaining and informative,"I really enjoyed this book, it is really informative, entertaining and gives and inside look at voice over acting. This is one of the few books that I will re-read becouse of all the usefull information, a must read for anyone starting out or considering a career as a voice actor."
5,Entertaining & Informative Read!,"I absolutly enjoyed this book! A personal account of Mr. Hogan's career and some great information to boot! I felt as though Mr. Hogan was guiding me, personally, through the ups and downs of the business and that he truelly wants each to succeed!"
2,Look Out! It's a Man in a Rubber Suit!!!,"Criticising this film is like shooting fish in a barrel with a howitzer. It's cheesy, it's ridiculous, it's utterly unrealistic.But it DOES have the first genuine, bona fide man-in-a-rubber-suit monster I've seen in ages.It wasn't long ago that almost any otherworldly creature seen on the screen was a stunt man in a stifling rubber suit. Whether it was a towering Godzilla or a dinky little Saucer Man, a Creature from the Black Lagoon or the Monster of Piedras Blancas, the phoney rubber monster suit ruled the screen.Here in the age of CGI, I didn't think we'd ever see another of these old-school horrors, so I admit I got a few chuckles out of this film. And if you have fond memories of those hokey, shambling rubberized monsters of yesteryear, maybe you'll smile, too."
3,The Best Chupacabra Horror Film Out There...,"Sadly, there are three or four Chupacabra (or ""Goat Sucker"" to us Americans) films floating around but this one has the highest production values.Based on this Tequila induced nightmare, ""Chupacabra Terror"" tells the story of a mad biologist who catches a Chupacabra and decides to transport him back to civilization on a victim-filled cruise ship. Of course, Chupy escapes from his oversized pet cage and starts tearing to pieces everybody in sight. John Ryes Davies plays the ship's captain who tries to put Chupy in his place, namely the morgue. Of course the creature has super-human strength and is bullet-proof!Along for the ride are a boat load of victims - literally. An actress playing the Captain's daughter provides the ""EEEEEK!"" sound effects and some actor fills in as the hero (Chupy's punching bag).A very bloody diversion."
1,Utter crap,Stupid people doing stupid things and a monster that looked like a kid could do better. Why weren't these people ashamed of themselves?
3,If your into the Saturday night Scifi Channel Flicks....,... you'll enjoy this. I myself thought it was fairly amusing because i like the kinda cheesy effects these low budget films have. And i like these scifi channel movies lik rock monster and all that stuff. Over all not the best but realli depends on what you like
2,2.5 stars... not too bad,"Not too bad of a monster movie. Its surely not the best, but with a littlegore, good actors(John Rhys-Davies) it helps this movie go from a 2 to a 2.5 score. The man in the monster suit does a pretty good job, and thesuit is well done. A better script would have helped, but with what wehave left, it is still entertaining and is good for a viewing."
1,Horrid...absolutely horrid,This is probably one of the most horrible movies I've ever seen. The acting was pretty bad. But...I guess if you're bored and want to laugh...I highly recommend it.
2,RETURN TO THE BLACK LAGOON,"Obviously filmed on a shoestring budget, CHUPACABRA TERROR marks the return of an actor in a rubber suit, intended to be frightening, but actually becoming quite comical. Giancarlo Esposito (one of filmdom's less appealing actors) plays some kind of scientist who finds a mythical beast called the Chupacabra, and smuggles it on board a luxury liner. Of course, some goofus deckhands release the creature and it starts eating up both crew and passengers. John Rhys Davies (shame on you, John, for taking on such roles) plays the ship's captain who also has his naively innocent daughter on board, and we get Dylan Neal as a handsome US Marshal to help fight the monster. No surprises, little suspense, and a few laughs...it's up to you if you're in the mood."
4,Ed!,"I didn't get into this story until after maybe a quarter through, but when I got into I was in. I was rooting for Ed and Audrey the entire book..."
4,Good Myth; Near Miss,"I am not a student of literature; just like to read good books. This is a good one. No way to explain it except as a myth; it could never happen. I liked the ending, contrary to some of the reviewers. He helps a lot of people, he gets the girl and the angel/guy walks off into the sunset and I'm left with the message that a person of worthless ordinariness can be transformed into a person of value if you will spend some time helping your fellow creatures. Sermonizing? So what? It got a little tiresome, but maybe because I read it too fast. - - Ed W."
5,Amazing!,"I read this after The Book Thief, my friend and I swapped books by Zusak. I picked it up, and read it in a day. After reading both books, I have found it is the characters who get to you. I am the Messenger delivers people from every walk of life, and one man who loves them all. Each one found a place into my heart, and I realized I know people just like them. The ending was beautiful, one of those that makes you want to go out and make a difference in the world. Zusak has secured himself in my favorite author list for sure!"
3,Promising,"This book has a clever-ish idea, some good dialogue, and really solid character development. People who read a lot will enjoy this book, and squirrel away the name of Markus Zusak knowing that all of the signs are there that he could one day pull off an all around 5-star job.People who read at the pace of a book or two in as many months will probably feel a bit gipped, especially by the attempt at a ""gotcha"" ending that doesn't quite come off.The book is not airtight, but it is still a real accomplishment and I look forward to Mr. Zusak's next title."
2,Massive disappointment,"I want to find Markus Zusak and shake him, shouting: ""Why for the love of all things good did you go and do a thing like that?!"". This book is ok. I didn't find it particularly readable, nor plausible, nor clever. In fact, I felt embarrassed when reading it on the tube, in case someone read over my shoulder and thought I actually liked teen fiction. Don't bother, I wish I hadn't. If, however, for some silly reason you haven't read The Book Thief yet: Buy. It. Now. (Did you see what I did there, did ya, did ya?!)."
2,A bit too convenient,"Hmmmm.First the premise: Ed is a 19 year old taxi driver living a pretty mundane existance until he stops a bank robbery. His life changes when he starts receiving anonymous aces in the mail with messages on them that he needs to decipher and carry out.Next, its a book for young adults and it did win Book of the Year for older readers from The Children's Book Council of Australia so I suppose thats saying something. However I didn't enjoy this book as much as everyone else seems to have. I found that everything worked out much too well for Ed and the story became quite predictable. I think the book is also a little too long in most places and in the end everything was wrapped up in a neat little package (thats not a spoiler - trust me you could see it coming!)"
2,Strangely preachy,"This was fun to read and the story was mysterious enough to keep me interested. On the other hand, the whole plot and the characters are so artificial and pretentious. It also tries to be moral in a preachy way. I often had the impression that there was a sermon lurking behind the facade of storytelling and ""cool"" characters. Then again, this is probably what so many like about it."
2,Not quite,"I was kind of annoyed that during a bank robbery the characters kept joking but then I could understand that it wasn't ""a real robbery"". Anyway, The book was interesting at the beginning when he was following his first card but then I lost interested because I realized that every card was a different story. So mainly is like a book of short stories without really saying so.I also hate the fact that the promiscuous girl gets the nice boy at the end. What does it tell people? Really?Anyway, I totally loved ""the book thief"" which is completely different. I do not recommend this book and I give it 2 stars because... well, it takes some effort to write a book!"
2,loved it...until I got to the end,"When I first picked up this book, I was riveted. I had to know who Ed would be delivering messages to, and how. Then see the effect on him afterward. And when Ed finished hearts, I nearly cried with happiness.Then I turned the page.Oh, how I wish I hadn't. I understood who the mystery person was, which is what ruins everything. It takes this beautiful story and turns it into a sermon. He preached about everything that he'd implied when Ed finished hearts. It almost felt like he didn't think his readers would ""get it,"" so he added that last part just to make sure. I find that very disappointing, and a bit insulting. He should have more faith in his readers."
3,Pales in comparison,"I recently read The Book Thief by this same author and was so moved that I HAD to pick up I Am the Messenger. I was hoping to have another amazing read, so perhaps my expectations were too high. While I felt it was still well-written with well-developed characters and an interesting storyline, I was disappointed in the end. My comment when finishing was, ""Huh...that was it?"" As others have noted, some of Ed's (main character) solutions to his problems were a bit too convenient and simple to be life changing and I was ready for it to be over 3/4 through. This title definitely pales in comparison to The Book Thief (which everyone should read) but I'll still try anything this author dishes out in the future."
2,Language and content in question,"I was so excited to begin reading this book, but as I got farther along into it, I began to feel sick. On every single page are several profanities and embarrasing sexual content. There is a full range of colorful language. Some are fairly mild, but others shocked me and made me feel greasy. There is so much talk about sex that I wonder if the main character actually cares for his maybe-someday-girlfriend, or was simply overcome by lust. I tried to get drawn into the story, but I just couldn't get past the language! This is NOT a children's book. Please be aware of this when purchasing this book. I wish that Mr. Zusak had given more thought to his readers when writing this. The storyline is excellent and his characters are well developed, but the entire book is marred by this one fatal flaw."
4,Excellent,"My teacher read us this book over the last couple months and it was great. It starts off very interesting with the bank robbery, and just keept going. The Author Marcus Zuzak is excellent at using descriptive words. He desribes things that you would never think of being described in that way. Nobody in our class could guess what happened at the end of the book. It keeps you guessing the whole way."
3,I AM THE MESSENGER,"The book is ok, just ok. I finished it but I could have easily put it away. It does have a good message about kindness and striving to be better as a person; however, I think the book would have served better as a short story in a magazine. That being said, his new book, ""The Book Thief"", is probably one of the best books I have ever read and I highly recommend it."
4,Engaging and entertaining,"Loved this book! Engaiging characters and a compelling plot. Kept you guessing too. I especially enjoyed picking the progression in writing and concept that becomes ""The Book Thief""."
4,Not as great as The Book Thief but still a very good read,"I like many others have read The Book Thief and fell in love so I wanted to read more by Markus Zusak so I picked this up.I loved, love The Book Thief and for me this didn't live up to that but it was still a very good book with a really good message. I love Zusak's writing style and he has a way of keeping you wondering where he is going but still interested at the same time.The ending was not bad but it wasn't great either... It fit well enough but I was hoping for a little bit more. This is a book that is worth your time tho and fantastic writing."
5,An excellent journey,"While not a quick reader, ""I am the Messenger"" grabbed my attention and drew me in with a pull that required that I finish the story. The characters were richly developed as the story unfolded, helping guide the journey to a powerful, thought provoking finish."
2,Disliked it..,"Picked up the book because the author penned ""Book Thief"" which is a novel I thoroughly enjoyed. However, this book I didn't care for very much. Occasionally there was a powerful line but the ""tasks"" seemed to convenient and too easy. After each task I thought ""That's it?"". I got bored half way through but wanted to finish it, thinking the end might be worth it. It wasn't. The book felt cheesy and very unrealistic. The main character didn't have a distinct personality to me and I didn't believe his actions to be realistic at all. If you're a seasoned literature reader, you may not enjoy this book, but if you're a young adult, you probably will."
2,Hard to Recommend,"This was a book that was hard to put down... yet at the same time I'm hesitant to say that I liked it. Obviously the writing drew me in, but the ending seemed a bit bizarre and contrived. Also, some of the actions the main character took along the way I found horrifying. I was also a bit surprised that this was a young adult book. There is no way I would ever let my teenager read this book - much too violence in a couple sections. I am not really a fan of someone beating the heck out of someone else ""for their own good."" So while I sped through the book fairly quickly, I have a hard time recommending it to anyone else."
4,"Great read for teens, especially boys","I ordered this book because I loved ""the Book Thief"" by the Zusak. It is very well written and I love theway he develops his characters and gets you involved in their lives. Probably not meant for older people like myself but a good read nonetheless. He has an unusual ability to make the plot less important than the humanity of his characters. I think this is a rare skill in novels that are not about crime, violence, or espionage. His books are more about growing up, integrity, friendship and what it means to be a good person."
3,Slow moving but good ending,"The Messenger definitely cannot hold a candle to Zusak's other novel The Book Thief. I had high hopes and expectations after reading The Book Thief. The Messenger was slow moving with only a few of the messages the main character delivers being very interesting. It starts to build up momentum at the end of the book and throws some interesting unexpected turns in there. Interesting concept, but it wasn't a 'can't put it down kind of book'. I don't regret reading it, but it wouldn't be at the top of my reading list."
4,Fun book,"I enjoyed this book. The author writes with clarity and allows the reader to get to know the characters as they develop within the story. The moral of the story is very overt and right there in your face and can be interpreted as a bit ""preachy"" by people wo are overtly cynical, but the overarching theme and the point of the book is something that we all could benefit from taking to heart. This is a fun book that I would recommend to anyone that is looking for some light reading with a wholesome message and some uplifting themes. I laughed, I cried, I ordered Chinese and then volunteered at a soup kitchen."
4,A Breath Of Fresh Air,"If you are looking for something totally different to the normal fare this book is for you. Great character development in what is generally a feel good story. Perhaps not quite as good as The Book Thief, but definitely worth reading."
3,Very Disappointing,"After falling in love with Zusak's masterpiece, The Book Thief, I wanted to read more by him. However, this book was a real disappointment. The writing felt flat, and I just couldn't buy into the premise (a young guy gets playing cards in the mail that identify people he needs to help). The book just didn't work for me, and it was a bit of chore to finish it. I'm guessing this is an earlier book than The Book Thief, but it feels like it was written by a totally different author. It wasn't a BAD book, but I guess I was so disappointed after the high of The Book Thief that this felt really low."
5,Young adult book with a message,A fun and captivating read even for adults. We can all incorporate the message of doing things for others into our lives. Zusak's use of words is wonderful. Marvelously descriptive almost with a poetic flare.
3,Mixed feelings,"It is a well-written book, regarding its description and language. But some parts of the plot are not credible enough and the ending appears out of the blue."
3,Distracting Errors,"The story here is a good one, and Ms. Russell's imagination is certainly fertile. For the most part the story held my attention and interest, but the jarring mistakes in spelling/usage were even more apparent in this second novel than the first.""Who's"" for ""whose"", it's for its, ""sighting"" when she meant ""citing"", and ""fool-hearty"" for ""foolhardy"". Those are just the obvious ones that come to mind- not to mention the use of ""descent"" for ""decent"" in her author's statement.This is a clear example of the need for professional proofreading, and the story itself would have been improved with the help of an experienced editor to provide some tightening and assist with clarity and continuity, plus a little more historical research on the author's part (e.g. drinking water in 1607? Rarely, if ever. That's what ale was for...).My enjoyment of a good story was marred by the misuse and misspelling of words."
3,I guess this episode was just an experiment,"We all know that the Three Stooges is mainly about its clever wit when it comes to the infinite amount of comedy bits throughout each short film in the series. But apparently, the first film, Woman Haters, didn't originally look at that direction. Sure, that comedy is still present, but it doesn't come as much as you'd expect.Another thing about Woman Haters is that it's entirely rhymed. It's actually very clever, but when it comes to the Stooges SINGING, then it just feels totally weird. After all, no other Stooges film was like this, but the fact just makes the film lose its appeal. Woman Haters remains to be a historical curiosity, and it's only for those that wish to see where the Three Stooges series started."
2,Classic Comedy with modern interruption...,"When I purchased this episode, I did so with certain caveats in mind. I knew that the video was not likely to be DVD quality, but I had not expected it to be interrupted by a commercial-like blurb. Do yourself a favor and skip these, you're better off finding them someplace else."
5,Perfect gift for my dad,Product was delivered very quickly and in time for me to give them to my dad for Christmas. The DVDs were brand new and I think he'll enjoy watching them for years.
4,Great set - Nyuk Nyuk Nyuk,"As far as Stooges collections go, this is a great first set and I plan now on getting the others in this series. Clear picture overall, good sound, and great shorts! The only thing that could make these better is if they were in wide-screen format instead of pan-n-scan fit for a regular television. If that happens, I guess I'll have to get that too."
4,Great CD,I'm a huge fan and the CD is the way to go to view the 3 Stooges. I guess the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the price. Volume Two is $20 bucks too.
2,Nothing Special in the end,"As a big Stooge fan I was eagerly awaiting this collection. I knew that most of the titles contained had already been released on previous discs, but I was still eager to buy this thinking there would be bonus features to make it worthwhile. Well, there aren't and so (besides a handful of shorts that haven't been released) this collection offers little more than what has already been released. If you haven't bought any Three Stooges discs yet, then buy this one because the transfer of picture is better and the years from 1934-36 are complete. However, if you already have the previous Columbia releases, this really isn't worth buying."
5,Another Stooges Fan's Opinion...,"When this was announced as a rumor on a certain message board a while back, I didn't believe it was true, considering the overpriced DVDs that had been released in the past. I guess Sony finally realized that if Warner can remaster, restore, and rerelease the bulk of the Looney Tunes and Tom & Jerry theatrical shorts on reasonably-priced DVD sets, then Sony had better wise up and do likewise for these non-animated theatrical shorts from a certain group of comedians who have had more influence, and more fans than the MGM or Warner cartoons!!!! To elaborate on Stooged and Confused's review...I will certainly buy all the sets if they come out, even the refurbished and Joe Besser ones!!"
5,Yay!!,"I am so happy to finally see the Stooges get the respect they deserve. This collection is cleaned up, full-length, and just wonderful. Buy it, and enjoy many clear and happy hours of nyuk-nyuks!"
4,Can't Wait for the grandkids to come,Looking forward to sharing this great entertainment with my grandkids. I'm glad they finally came up with a quality version of The Three Stooges stuff.
5,Finally!,It's about time the Stooges work was released in chronological order! It's fascinating to see the evolution of their humor and gags. I think it puts a whole new light on the boys. Totally worth it.
4,Great water carrier,"I've been using mine for over a year without any leakage or other problems. It's been used for a total of about six trips ranging from car camping along Route 66, to canoeing, to long weekends mountain biking in Wisconsin. I've folded, crammed, and stuffed it into nooks and crannies in my trunk, into my backpack, scraped it against rocks, dropped it when full etc. and it held up perfectly. The only issue I have is that it's hard to dry when you come back and want to store it away. I've resorted to using a hair dryer which does the trick okay. The valve can go into the dishwasher."
3,A litlle disappointed...,"The missy elliot's track is very disappointing as well as a couple of other tracks (abra cadabra,fire fire,the game and crowded) but the rest is nice.To me the only great ones are:dance commanderbreakdownnu nuanthem part twooutta my mindlove songthe rest is not bad but not great.But don't get me wrong,normally i love hip/hip,rap,rnb songs but those chosen for the soundtrack aren't the best ones in these categories.Just listen to it before buying,don't make the same mistake i did..."
3,Pleasantly surprised,"I have to say that after seeing ""Stick It"" last night I found the music to be so fun. The soundtrack only conveys half the fun of this movie. If you like the music you'll love the story & hardcore images that go with it!"
3,its ok,"I mainly like the Missy song, but umm, at a guess the reason Fall Out Boy didn't make it on, is probably cuz it's Fall Out Boy. Hello?"
3,The movie played good songs that are not listed on the CD,"The movie played awsome songs like brainstew and renegade, why aren't they on the CD? what a rip"
5,Incredible Movie!,"My favorite movies are the ones that I'm still thinking and talking about days later. I didn't expect a Documentary to be That Movie, but it was! It's one of those ""Nuggets"" that not everyone has heard of, but Everyone should see!I got the DVD last week and also enjoyed the Extra Footage & Interviews that explained a lot of things that happened during and after the filming.. I was especially surprised to see what happened to the Director."
5,"""A MUST SEE""","I loved every second of this movie. One of the best I've seen in a long time. I watched it, took it to my moms house and watched it again. I plan to visit Lacie, Tabitha and Sampson at The Wild Animal Sanctuary very soon. Thanks."
5,Absolutely Amazing,"I saw this film in the theater. It was a packed house, and from the audience's reaction (and my own), you would never have known that we were watching a documentary. It's very exciting!I was also impressed with how fair the movie was to both sides of the issue and to the people who are shown in the film. You'll be talking about it for days after you see it. Don't miss this one!"
2,Nothing new,"This book is fine for someone who has no previous knowledge of the subject. However, for anyone who has read other materials on this topic, this book had nothing new to say, even though there was much that could be said, particularly of the post-Iacocca and post-DC merger eras.For my money, Moritz' and Seaman's ""Going For Broke"" remains the best book on the history of the old Chrysler Corp., even though that book is now 23 years old."
5,I love David Cassidy,"Unfortunately,I bought it for my U.S mate who was crazy about David Cassidy so much as I would have loved to see it. I live in U.K so if ever you get U.K version Yes please I'll definitely order one.Happy New Year to you all.Catriona Burke"
5,Five stars for getting it right.,"They used the original theme song ""When We're Singin'"" which, I believe, hasn't been featured since the show originally ran.The transfers are crisp and clean, the sound is wonderful, but that's only from watching 3 episodes so far...bring out the rest of them!"
2,watch in small doses!,"I can't beleive i waited all week as a kid to watch this Friday nights. I forgot how corny this show was. It does, however, bring back memories. You can pick episodes to watch, but one drawback is that you can't move forward or back in an episode. I found this out when i saw that Farrah Fawcett made a guest appearance, but I couldn't play it back for my husband."
4,The Music includes true Partridge Hits!!,"The music is great, even making my 13 year old a Partridge fanatic. It has on it their big hits. The commentaries add a lot to the DVD. Danny Bonaduce does his commentary along with the first episode, which is both informative and hilarious. Nice to see Shirley Jones, David Cassidy, and Danny Bonaduce as they appear now. The plots and antics of the show, itself, are not near as funny as Season 2, in fact some are boring. It is interesting to see young becoming stars such as Farrah Fawcett, Jaculyn Smith, and Mark Hamill. But, if you don't remember those people, then, just buy this for the music. The music appearance section with the band singing their hits is classic. You may find yourself watching the songs more than the shows. Summary,,Buy Season 1 for the music, Buy Season 2 for the show."
5,PARTRIDGE DVD,NICE TO SEE AND HEAR SOME FAVORITE MEMORIES! POINT ME IN THE DIRECTION OF ALBUQUERQUE!!
3,Gift for my wife,My wife grew-up watching The Partridge Family. Got this as a gift to show the kids what we had on TV growing up.
5,"Gregg L. Friedman MD, Psychiatrist, Hallandale Beach, FL","The Partridge Family ran from 1970 to 1974. It was great fun to watch the first season on this tape. The show brings back fond memories of the early 1970's. It is well worth the purchase price. By Gregg L. Friedman MD, Psychiatrist, Hallandale Beach, FL"
3,FIVE stars...down to THREE.,"When I first got the carrying case, I was really impressed by the sleek design, cool color, and good fit. The phone will snugly fit in there, even with the earpiece attached. That's what I would rated five-stars. But, that soon changed after using it for a couple of weeks. The color is fading especially around the edges. It is not that easy to clean the accumulated dust off the blue fabric. Also, the belt clip is now somewhat loose, allowing the case to easily fall off as you are getting out of your car. I guess as far as belt clips go, the Motorola StarTac Holster's clip is the best I've used because it ""hooks"" around the belt, not just ""clips"" on it. That is why I conclude with a three-star rating."
3,"Comfy, but not very secure.","When I first got this case, I was very impressed with it, in particular, the comfortable fit. It made it a lot easier to carry my phone around. No antennas jabbing you in the gut when you sit down. :)Unfortunately, there is a drawback -- the phone tends to slip out of the case rather easily...as a result, it has fallen off my belt a few times, and I am currently waiting for a replacement phone to be sent out. Perhaps a thicker battery (and thus a thicker phone) would solve the problem, but I may have to get another case that will hold my phone more securely."
5,Carrying Case for T-28,I believ it is a very nie case and handy; I would like to know if it is possible to import such carrying case to Malta.
5,Fantastic!,"The product from Amazon was excellent and shipped quickly. The quality of the recording is unsurpassed, and the included booklet is great fun with new photos and text. Europe '72 used to be the quintessential introduction to the magic of the Dead....no more! This fabulous set is without equal in terms of setlist and excitement. The band is ON throughout and this set demonstrates over and over again why we say, ""There is nothing like a Grateful Dead concert"". If you want to know why so many of us still listen to the Dead after all these years, get this very reasonably priced masterpiece!"
5,Brilliant.....But don't throw away Steal Your Face!,"I agree with every review thusfar, this 5CD box is absolutly brilliant, from U.S Blues on Disc 1, to We Bid You Goodnight on CD 5. However, as brilliant as this is (and we all know it is) Steal Your Face still has some shining moments not saved on this Soundtrack. Missing are beautiful versions of Sugaree, Must Have Been the Roses, Ship of Fools (a gorgeous version), Cold Rain & Snow ,among others. Sure, we all know that Steal Your Face wasnt the most perfectly put together live Dead album, but it is still The Grateful Dead playing beautifully. I would think this Soundtrack would at least include all the bonus DVD songs, like Sugaree....It is missed.It goes without saying that this package is brilliant, and pefect all the way thru. Just don't give up on Steal your Face.Go back and listen to Ship of Fools"
3,Compressor,"I was given this tank and compressor for Christmas, and five months down the road, the compressor died. So now, since the tank is attached to a pressure censor that works with the Wolo 840-C compressor, i am SOL."
1,Pissed,"Bought this and the Wolo Giant air horn, installed it then found out you need a $50 value and an $8 horn button. The horn looked great, but can't use it till I get the value installed and put in the horn button. What a nickle and dime company, I won't be buying from them again. If you are thinking of buying a Wolo product, check other brands, then when you go back to Wolo, see what's not included, before you buy. This was my first Air Horn set up so I didn't know anything about what I needed except for what the add said, doesn't tell you you need the other thing. Sure now I know, and would have ordered them all at once. But when I was pricing different systems, it might have made a difference in which system I bought. Hiding needed accessories really pissed me off, and WE the consumer aren't going to take it any more."
1,"CD ""Shindler's List""","In the first place, I ordered this so quickly, I didn't realize it was the soundtrack from the movie (I wanted to order the movie.). But.........since it was, the music was very depressing, as it should be, considering the movie is depressing as well. No wonder it was just 10 cents plus shipping. I learned my lesson - - ""take your time in ordering and consider all details"". Service was great - - I received the CD in a matter of a few days."
5,Williams tops himself here,"This soundtrack is very moving and deep. It's different from the ordinary soundtracks Williams writes: It's more classical than popular. He doesn't use his tell-tale composing techniques. I came to respect Williams a lot more after this score was written. In traditional Jewish-sytle music, it portrays the delicate emotions of this historic nightmare. My favorite track is ""Schindler's Workforce"" with its key changes and steady rhythm. The music swells until you are surrounded by it. The soundtrack gets better each time you hear it -- the true mark of good music."
5,this guys a genius!,"I didn't realize it till today, but I own 3 of John William's soundtracks (Glory, Empire of the Sun, and Schindler's List) and there's at least one song on each that gives me goosebumps! I've also cried at one moment in one of the movies his music is in, while his music is playing. Hes such a tearjerker, and his music is brilliant. Imagine this coming from a 15 yr. old girl that like, lives for KoRn and Limp Bizkit! John Williams' music is the kinda stuff I'll be playing for my grandkids in 50 years!"
5,Could listen it for hours!,"I'm fifteen and not an abitual clasic music lover. But this soundtrack... my friend and I listen it all time! Did'nt know John William before, now I'm sure he's a genius. His music describes so well the horrors of the war, if you saw the movie, you'll immediatly know what I mean. I loved it!"
5,Simply one of the best musical scores...EVER!,"This music, it is breath takingly beautiful and full of emotion. It makes your arm hair stand on end to listen to the notes playing through your mind. I can feel this music, all the way through to my soul."
2,Nice looking but......,"The Ericsson Classic Phone Carrying Case for Ericsson Phones is sharp looking but unfortunately it comes off your belt too often. The detachment takes place whenever you seat or kneel down. I was fortunate to feel it coming off and falling down on separate occasions. Unfortunately, I lost the carrying case just minutes after I had answered a call while driving. I didn't lose the phone, because I had put it in my jacket pocket while the carrying case remained attached to my belt. The carryig case must have come off when I stepped out of the car to pick up my kid from school. I went back to school grounds to look for it after I realized it had come off, but it was too late. Someone else had picked it up. I am glad my phone was not it."
5,DVD Victory Parade Cairo 1943,Excellent value for a very useful reference to the real livery of vehicles and equipment of the later stages of the allied campaign in North Africa. Highly recommended.
3,Not A realy Good BOOK,"This book is not very good, because it doenst have alot of things in it. If you are looking for a book to do plays and such, this will not be a good one. This book does not disscuss day to day issues, and i would not recommend it."
2,Desperate? Need a scene? Get something else...,"""Relevant"" is the wrong word to describe this book. I would describe it more as ""stereotypical"" if I were creating the title. The scenes are all about the self-centered, hormone-driven, culture-obsessed teen that exists only in extreme conditions. If you really need a scene and want to show your audience what ""today's shallow teen"" would be like, use this book. I suggest you find something with more depth and meaning. This might as well be titled ""Deranged Perspectives: Stereotypical Scenes for the Stereotypical Teen"" by Mary ""I should have majored in something else"" Krell-Oishi. Sorry, Mary. I wish I kept the receipt."
3,not like the picture,think picture shows butt and boobs so i bought this thinkin i was gettin both but no i only recieved the boobs now i do like the boobs they are huge but i would of been much happier if i got what i was thinkin i was gettin
4,A clear and concise historical book,"I really enjoy reading about the different monarchs throughout time. Ormrod's book has made it so easy to read about and learn more about these kings and queens who have shapped the world. ""The Kings and Queens of England"" is the perfect introduction to all of the different houses and all of the different monarchs. The way in which this book was written allows the reader to either read the book completely or look up particular intrests. He has made it so easy and fairly enjoyable.I very much recomend this book to anyone who has a historical intrest in the royal families because this is very well written and filled with loads of information that I have not heard any where else."
4,A Good Read,"Gelernter's treatment of the phenomenon of software development does clarify things considerably. We sometimes remember the author as one of the Unabomber's victims. If I remember right, he lost his hands to a mail bomb.If you liked this book, please read ""1939: The Lost World of the Fair."" I enoyed the hell out of it; I'd love it if he'd consider writing more fiction."
1,"Good Idea, Horrible Presentation","Usually, I value the writing of scientists for the clarity, reason and sometimes poetry found. But this is just awful. It almost seems like one of those self-help books with BIG letters and about two paragraphs per page.The idea is that we can create ""mirror worlds"", identical but virtual representations of any entity - social, geographical, testable - that we desire. At first this sounds exciting but as he explained it, I slowly got the idea that it was nothing more than (pardon the pun) ""smoke and mirrors"". I just could not understand the ultimate use of such a structure except perhaps for traffic control or future predictions of population trends or growth. Nice try but no cigar."
2,Black Bowl,"I am not very pleased with this bowl. In general, considering the shape, finish and foam pad this is not a 5 star item. I am not sure that the black is its natural finish. I purchased this bowl to use with a craft project and not around food, so it works for that purpose."
2,Polk Audio Atrium 45 Speaker: well constructed ... Muddy Sound,"The Polk Audio Atrium 45 Speakers are pretty well made with gold plated terminals. They do NOT look cheap.I intended to use the speakers as back-surround in a 7.1 setup, based on the raving reviews here.I found that the Polk speaker sounds VERY MUDDY compared to my inexpensive Axiom M2i bookshelf speakers that I use for my front and surround channels.I then compared the Polk with the cheap and tiny MA Audio speakers (at a quarter of the Polk's price) in my sun room. Again, the MA Audio speakers sounded crystal clear, but lacking in bass, understandably, COMPARED to the Polk.I have no idea why the Polk Atrium 45 speakers received such favorable reviews. May be the reviewers listened to the Polks without comparing them to others ?"
5,Polk rocks!,"Have Polk audio speakers for home theater, and purchased a pair of these for the courtyard previously. Liked them so much, I bought a secong pair! Bass response is unbelievable for a speaker of this size."
4,Small package - Big Sound,"I have been very pleased with the sound of these indoor/outdoor speakers. Although I normally go for higher priced speakers, I was a bit more on a budget this time and have been pleasantly surprised by the crisp highs that these speakers deliver. They really fill up the new deck we had built. And surprisely, the bass response is much better than I would have expected from such a small cabinet. You can't do much better for the price."
5,Great Speakers,This is my first set of outdoor speakers to purchase and I love the atrium 45. They are smaller than most other speakers with the same power. Easy to install and the sound is great. I have a backyard with pool and have 2 of these installed. They have more than enough power to fill up the outside with music. Great buy in my opinion.
5,GREAT SPEAKERS,SPEAKERS ARE AWESOM EVEN MY WIFE LOVES THEM. SOUND IS CRISP AND EASE OF MOUNTING MADE INSTALLING THEM A BREEZE. I ALREADY HAVE A SET OF POLK JR.I WOULD RECC. THESE SPEAKERS.
5,Great Outdoor Speaker,"I bought these after listening to a neighbors pair that he had out around his unenclosed pool deck. They had been there for a year and looked brand new. He had another pair on his porch that were three years old and looked almost as good.The bass response on these babies, despite their size, has to be heard to be believed. The outside enviroment is murder on bass, but these speakers sound great! For the price and size, you can't beat them."
2,Speaker life,"these speakers have a great sound, but my experience is they don't last in the weather, I had to replace both speakers over a period of 2 years"
3,Cheap price for average sound!,The price tag was great for the average sound. I saved $100+ buying them through Amazon. We live on the ocean and plan to replace them every couple years.
4,"Great speakers, terrible customer service","Speakers sound great, look great. But be aware if you have to send in one of the speakers in for repair it's a terrible process. One of the mid-range drivers broke in one of the speakers. I called, packaged up the speaker and sent it in to the Polk Audio service center. I called 2 weeks later and asked the status, the guy said he has no idea where the speaker is. Then told me there are two palates of speakers that have to be worked on still. Apparently they have one guy that fixes all of their speakers. It's now been 3 weeks and I still don't have my broken speaker back.But the speakers do sound terrific when they work, hence the 4 stars."
5,Perfect Outdoor speaker,"I live in south florida and have found these speakers to not only sound great but they can handle any weather thrown at them. I have two sets of these speakers around our pool attached to palm trees. They have been exposed to direct sun, 10"" rain storms and 40 mile per hour winds during tropical storms and they look and sound like new.I would highly recommend these for anyone looking for a worry free speaker to put in an outdoor location either covered or not you can't go wrong."
4,Great Speakers,These are great speakers for the money. I would recommend these to anyone looking to enhance their backyard with some tunes.
1,Color,This bike is hot pink. I ordered red. The online site shows red and the outside of the box shows red. But the bike is hot pink.
3,Mongoose Tirage,"Ordered the Mongoose Tirage. Yes, it did show up at more door hot pink, not red. Maybe that is why the bike image is currently not available to view. I actually like the pink color better. Very easy to assemble- my husband had it together and on the road within 30 minutes. Not a bad bike for the money- Husband and kids all have $500+ bikes. I just wanted a bike to keep up with them- not hit the trails hard. This will suit me fine- I just don't think I'd do any heavy mountain biking with it, but for light trails or cruising around the neighborhood, it will be great."
3,Pink!,"I'm pretty sure the bike shown in the picture is red -- unless my monitor is just way off.The bike I received is hot pink.I haven't tried it out yet, just wanted to comment on the color."
2,Don't fit right,These rails are barely functioning to suspend my 1U server. They slide in an out but when in the inserted position one rail comes off track. I expected better.
4,Good overview of an interesting subject,"This is a great book for young people interested in boats and unusual ways of living. Covers cultures from all over the world in a well-written, easy to follow format. The drawings and diagrams are good, but some of the pictures are a bit dated and textbook-ish. However, since this is the only book that covers this subject at all, it's not a problem. About 30 pages long with glossary and index."
4,Pretty cool ...,"I watched the first Secret Skatepark Tour after watching all of the Tony Hawk Gigantic Skatepark tours. I enjoy the skating as much as I enjoy the off day antics of the mad crew.I really wanted this DVD to see Rodney Mullen doing some of the tricks I only dream of. He's there and seems like such a neat guy. Most of the crew are there as well.For some reason I felt this was a lot shorter than the other DVD, but I am not sure if that's right. Watch the extras, especially for the one called 'Get it Petit' about one of the cameramen who also skates.All in all it's well shot and edited like you'd expect, but I just felt that it was shorter than the first one in terms of skating content which is why it doesn't get 5 stars."
1,Total waste of money,I bought this book because I lost my owner's manual before I had a chance to learn some of the advanced functions. The author's style is so wordy and obtuse that it might as well have been written in Greek.
2,Great Pan!! But something went wrong????,"I just love this pan. Good quality pan? So I thought, till the non stick paint peeled off. I do love all the spring form pans. Didn't realize how great these pans were until I had to get on a Gluten Free diet. All of the recipes call for the use of these types of pans. I'm sold. My never go back to traditional ones. Why? The foods so easy to get out of the pan. I'm not sure what went wrong. Really disappointed... I guess I'll have to look for another one. Maybe another brand..."
1,Rust developed after first use,"My wife used this product the first time to create rice crispy treats. Just wanted to test the functionality. Made them, washed this pan, let it air dry. Next time she went to use it she noticed what looked like rust on the back of the bolts (side where the cake would be cooking) of the locking mechanism. Smelled like rust, looked like rust, washed it, dried it used it for a cake, washed it and air dried it.I picked it up and out came rusty orange water from the lip part of the outer ring and along the lip part of the bottom of the pan.Threw it away. What a waste. Anyone else have a rust problem?"
3,SQUARE SPRINGFORM PAN,"It's nice to have a square springform pan so that you can easily cut up your cheesecake at the office party but... If you make the mistake of picking this pan up at the corners, the sides will pop off of the bottom and you will loose your cake. Also, although this is a nice heavy construction pan, it is really difficult for me to gauge when my cake should be done. My round pans are much thinner metal and I know how long to cook them. I like the pan but if I really want to be sure my cake will come out just right, I use the cheaper round thinner pans."
2,Not equal to The Summer Country!,"This book is the continuation of James Hetley's The Summer Country. This time around we barely ever leave The Summer Country, while in Oak's predecessor we visited the normal world quite often. The plot centers on Maureen dealing with the repurcussions of the death of Dougal and her battle with Fiona. During this process, Maureen falls into the clutches of her old friend, alcohol, which can't be good...I only gave this book two stars because only the last fifty pages are worth reading, the rest of the book drags ON and ON. This will be worth the money for fans of The Summer Country but everyone else would be best advised to stay away from this book! Hope that helped.-Bohema"
4,An incomplete retrospective,"Sadly, 30 Years Of Maximum R&B is incomplete for several reasons. For one, the inexplicability to include ""single"" versions of given songs (example: ""Who Are You"") instead of full-length; this goes further with the then-unreleased material, as most of that would be re-released in the MCA Remasters series as full-length versions.Such is the greatness of The Who that any retrospective that doesn't include the key portions of Tommy and Quadrophenia alone is rendered incomplete.However, the main reasons that this box set is worth buying are simple. For the completist, this contains the unadultered versions of songs that were later remixed with different tracks -- in this case, ""Music Must Change"", ""Naked Eye"" and ""Eminence Front"" come immediately to mind. For those new to The Who, Maximum R&B serves its purpose as an introduction, even if MY idea as the introduction is to get Tommy, Live At Leeds, Who's Next and Quadrophenia to start."
5,Quite simply the greatest Rock n' Roll band ever assembled,"This set is an absolute must buy for every music collection. Never before has there been a group that combined the hard edge of power Rock with the sensitivity of a poet. The more you listen to a track, the more subtleties you notice. Every song reflects the conflict between the group's lead personalities, Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend. Roger's powerful vocals backed by the amazing touch and grace that Pete's lyrics and background synthesizer create an amazing sound that has never been equaled. And there are four discs full of it!"
5,THE WHO : MAXIMUM R & B,i already had a respectable WHO collection but this is like icing on the cake..
4,possumsmcbikeritems,"There are other single 'Who' Cd's I'd buy before this one collection.It is good but mainly because it has some rare and unobtainable music etc on it, good but not great."
4,I MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE,"I am not a profound fan of The WHo. All I had was a compilation, MY GENERATION. I knew WHO's NEXT and TOMMY were considered their masterpieces, but never bothered buying them, because here in Brazil they are so expensive (you can find them only as imports) So, I went for the box set (import, of course) and spend my hard-earned money on it, risking to love or hate the band forever. I hit the bull eye. The music is fabulous."
4,We just can't get enough,"It's virtually impossible to put in only four CD's the best works of the Who, so this one, although it brings some previously (officially) unreleased material (""Who's better, Who's best"", released in 1988 as a greatest hits' album, suffers from the same disease), doesn't fill the hole. 75% of the box is excellent, but the other 25% really disapoints. Choose the original albuns."
4,A full picture of The Who,"This box set is a testament to the versatility of The Who. The early pop singles, the radio-friendly rock songs, bits from ""Tommy"", the trademark pure rock of the Who, the ""techno"" music - it's all here. And most of it is very good. My only complaint is that ""Quadrophenia"" doesn't get quite enough exposure in the set. Other than that, ""30 Years Of Maximum R&B"" is a fantastic showcase."
2,OVERBLOWN,"I'm sorry to say this, but buying this compilation will not solve your problems corcerning possessing the best of THE WHO. The WHO was always a limited band, so you can't simply throw their songs together in any kind of compilations. You must have their best albuns (WHO'S NEXT, TOMMY and QUADROPHENIA), where the songs sounds much better inside the context. This box set is overblown and one of the worst of its kind."
1,Not happy at all.,"I ordered the Who's 30 Years Of Maximum R&B; 4-cd set.I received only one disc of the four, and it was damaged - looked like the surface of the disc had been dropped on sand. It had pock-marks in the plastic and the information layer had been penetrated.I wrote the seller requesting some resolution, never received a reply.I will not do business there again.Buyer BEWARE!!!"
1,WASTE OF money,"THis box set by the WHo is a waste of time and money. First of all, the WHo has only three worthwhile albums: WHO's NEXT, QUADROPHENIA and TOmmy. Everybody knows that. So, it's simply impossible to fill 4 Cd's with great Who material. I'd like to know the genius mind who chose to insert spoken speeches all around!! What ""exciting"" they sound !! I'd also like to know who choe to insert a cover of TWIST and SHOUT here...But, well, like Pete Towshend arrogantly wrote in the preface of the booklet inside, if you don't like The WHo,.., you!!! What a nice guy !!"
5,No Stink,This got rid of mildew smell. I am a smoker and now you can't tell my car was ever smoked in. The A/C performs better.
1,not very helpful,"While it's a good idea, the outlines are too sketchy to be worthwhile. I wouldn't order this book."
1,Re-issue of another DVD--Formerly Titled--The Complete Yellowstone,"The dvd is wonderful, but I already had it under the orginal name...name change not mentioned in add for new dvd..If you don't have the orginal, then this is a very good dvd."
3,No complaints,"I don't use these myself, but the person I've purchased them for has not filed any complaints about them. Seem kind of pricy to me."
5,Great product at a good price,"We used to use the Depends with Tabs, but they were discontinued by Subscribe and Save, so we looked for another alternative. These seem to work even better. The tabs are easy to fasten and the coverage is very good. Plus, the leg openings are elasticized to prevent leaks. After going through several different brands that resulted in lots of extra laundry due to leaks, we were pleased to find these. They are much more reasonably priced than at the local surgical supply store, and they are available through Prime and Subscribe and Save."
4,Worked well/A bit larger than expected...,"We used these with our 9 yr. old son/58 lbs. who has special needs. He had fewer leaks (esp. overnite) with these than the Prevail junior sized variety, so that is a definite plus. They are fairly huge on him(got their smallest-a medium 'adult' though), so we wish they had a 'small' or even xtra small(!) adult size. That being said, I'll order again soon because they have been the ones that leak the least.....and we've tried SO many brands, etc. I would recommend these....and the tabs are those velcro-ish grippy ones that can be undone (for pottying attempts or just to check him, although there is a blue strip that appears/color change when wet) several times and not tear up the diaper & they 'stay put'!"
5,Well pleased with these for performance and price,"Our multihandicapped son has been using this type of product for about twenty-five years. We switched over to Prevail about three years ago and love the fit, the reuseable tabs are great, and the product really keeps him dry and secure. The cost is in line with some other briefs but we think these are the better product."
2,Homely Bloomers,"The price is right especially with no shipping fee. And they hold a lot of moisture without leaking.But the diaper is huge. I checked the package. It says large which is the size we use. So, they are either packaged wrong or sized incorrectly compared to other brands. Also the person who wears them developed a rash. May or may not have been caused by diaper, but we quit using them and it's gone away. I used one of the 4 packages. Wondering if I can return the other 3 packages of these homely bloomers?"
3,Decent bike,"I bought this bike 3 months ago, rode it hard (traffic, potholes, 10 miles a day, I weigh about 190) and now the rear wheel is shot (the internal ball bearings got loose and now it's unsalvageable.) Good deal for the money, but you get what you pay for ..."
5,beautiful!!!,The Portable Beat Reader introduced me to the Beat Generation which has since become one of the most important influences on my writing and even my life. Everybody needs to get beat!
4,good summary,"a lot of ""must read authors"" and some great lesser knowns. weather your a die hard beat reader or just dipping your toes, a nice collections."
4,Great introduction,"Though I am an English major, I wasn't very familiar with the ""Beat Generation"" writers. I became interested following a conversation with my son regarding his doctoral disssertation. We both now own copies of this reader, and I find it to be a good introduction to a group of writers who stood out against the grain in their time. I particularly enjoyed the general introduction and the subsequent introductions, as they set a good backgroud against which I could understand the writing.Highly recommended."
4,A Great Guide If You Don't Know What You Like,"This book features some excellent beat writers and includes informative blurbs on their history and style. Each artist has a little chunk of their writing for you to sample, and the material is everything from stories to letters to classically bad prose.What impressed me were the essays by each other, on the actual generation hype.""Young people seemed more intense, clutching, and I couldn't help feeling they took themselves too seriously... 'good, clean fun' appeared to be a thing of the past. Or perhaps the aura of suspicion and defensiveness was merely a reflection of my own fears..."" --Carylon CassadyIt's a great book for deciding which authors you want to read more of."
5,Essential for fans of 20th century literature,"Simply put, this is what I turn to when I need inspiration for reading, for creating, for anything. It combines wonderful bios of everyone from Kerouac to Bob Dylan, and their poems, book excerpts, and lyrics galore. Absolutely enjoyable, absolutely essential. Thank god for Ann Charters."
4,Introducing The Beats,"After riding the whirlwind of On The Road and Howl, many readers will acquire an appetite for Beat literature that will lead them to this book. Ann Charters serves up some of the best pieces of Beat Literature in this anthology. However, some inclusions, such as excerpts from On The Road, could be considered sacrilege, as the texts were never meant to be cut up, and suffer as a result. The Bob Dylan lyrics included by Charters indicate that she was no Dylan scholar, as other tracks would have been more suitable. However, with inclusions such as Neal Cassady's letters, William S. Burroughs adventure narratives, and the lesser known Beat poetry, this anthology is indispensable."
1,Not the Louis you want to hear,"I was lead astray by the reviews. I love Louis Armstrong. These may be some of his biggest hits, technically good music, but this recording isn't New Orleans or Preservation Hall. The big orchestra and choir arrangements produced in a sterile studio are not the way to enjoy Louis Armstrong. They have no feeling or personality. There is no warmth. With the exception of ""What a wonderful World"" and ""La Vie En Rose"" I did not enjoy any of the arrangements. If you want a great live recording with personality, live jazz, and blues and many of these same songs and many more spend your money on ""The Katanga Concert"". Try Anything with Ella Fiztgerald if you want some great duets singing the 30 and 40 standards. If you are an opera fan try the Louis Amrstrong and Ella Fiztgerald recording of ""Porgy & Bess""."
4,Louis Armstrong,"I bought this CD as a Christmas gift, so I haven't heard it yet. But the tracks I've heard elsewhere are awesome."
3,Not the best Armstrong,"I didn't find anything remarkable about this album. It seems that I have heard lots better Armstrong arrangements than what is represented here. I recommend Louis Armstrong Greatest Hits (RCA Victor) instead, even though it has fewer selections and totally different selections, except for What a Wonderful World. Even that song is slightly different on the other album. This is not a bad album and it may claim to have Armstrong's All Time Greatest Hits, but there are better Armstrong albums out there. Gone Fishin' is a pleasant enough ditty but I don't know that it belongs on this album. This album is a little disappointing because it could have been so much better. As one reviewer pointed out a 2-CD album would have been nice and more inclusive of some of the great Armstrong songs. Where is Basin Street Blues, St. Louis Blues, Mood Indigo and Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?"
5,Buy this if you have ever heard one of his songs.,"I first bought this cd only for the first track (it's a wonderfull world), but then listening to the rest of the tracks made me realize how much of a genious he was, and how many tracks had accumulated over his carrer that were purely golden. The other tracks should not be ignored."
2,"Big disappointment, arrangements reminiscent of '50s movies","I wish I'd not listened to all the positive reviews here. I keep making this mistake. So here's another opinion.What a Wonderful World is lovely.The rest, except for Skokian, is not the Louis Armstrong I wanted to hear. The background voices and the arrangements remind me of some Hollywood Epic, or one of those movies where the stars prance down a broad staircase, or of a western from the 50s. Blek!And we've got Bing Crosby (instead of Ella Fitzgerald).I did not pay attention to the fact that this is one of those greatest hits recordings. Never good as the music is invariably geared for the lowest common denominator of the mass market. I was swayed from this policy by all those 4 stars in the other reviews.If you want Louis Armstrong unencumbered with that 50s sound, look for an older recording. We'll try again..."
4,This is it - The Greatest Hits,"It's unbelievable this album sounds so good when it was recorded years ago. All the songs you love are here and done in only the style Louis could do it. The 'song 'Gone Fishin' with Bing Crosby is a bit of a dud but other than that, pick it up and let it roll."
4,basic leave in conditioner,"perks up my hair and one of the few things out there that doesn't cause an allergic reaction. i don't need plants and perfumy smells in my hair. i have short hair and need leave in conditioner to give it a bit of body and shape without making my eyes tear or making me sneeze. probably not the original formula from my childhood, but i was frankly drawn toward the familiarity of the product name and kept buying it because it does what it's supposed to do without unnecessary extras. also doesn't leave my hair sticky or gummy like a lot of other products do. it's better to use just a little and rub it in. if you use a big glob- it can leave hair bit sticky."
5,Alberto VO5 Sheer Hairdressing,"This is one product I always keep a good supply of in my home because I never want to find an empty tube with no back-up on hand. Just the tiniest dab of Alberto VO5 Sheer Hairdressing after shampooing smoothes my hair, makes styling easier and adds a nice shine. While I don't have frizzy hair I find this to be one of my favorite hair care products. If I forget to apply it I can feel the difference immediately in my hair when I start to blow dry and style. Time for a dab of VO5!"
4,Literature of journalism--not an oxymoron.,"A well-selected anthology of non-fiction literature. Berner presents important pieces of 20th century journalism, from Orwell's writings on poverty through New Journalism and other experiments in journalistic style, accompanied by generally readable and interesting essays placng the pieces in historical context. Stories range from the tragic (Hiroshima, Cold Blood) to the subversive (Garcia Marquez's ""Shipwrecked Sailor"") to the entertaining (articles by Lillian Ross and Hunter Thomas). Most of the selections prove that truth can be more moving, disturbing, engaging, and fascinating than fiction."
3,An okay kitty-kat book,"I'd agree with the earlier reviewer who said this was best for smaller readers -- the text and art aren't amazing, but might be just right to capture the imagination of toddlers who live in cat-friendly households."
3,"An Okay Book for Babies and Toddlers - a review of ""I Love Cats""","The artwork in ""I Love Cats"" is simple and cute and the rhyming text works as a good read-aloud that I would say is targeted for babies and toddlers.While nice, I think the topic is too simple for older children to get much out of it. An example of text follows so you can judge the 'level' for yourself.I love cats.Stripy cats.Spotted cats.Cats that count drips.Climbing cats.Scaredy cats.Cats that do flips.Three Stars. The book does seem sturdy with its thick, somewhat waxy pages. The artwork is sweet and simple and attractive, but we would say it is geered for babies and toddlers based on the rhyme and that it won't hold the attention of most preschoolers.And at this price we'd take a look at it at the Library before buying it. (Which we did.)"
3,"Nice book, shame about the missing diagrams!","A really useful book if you, like me, collect miniature 'salesman sample' anchors and want to date them. The great shame is that most of the pictures and diagrams are missing from the first chapter. I emailed a list of these to the address supplied for reporting problems, but after 4 weeks have not had a reply.If you can get this title at a low price it would still be worth it."
2,2,I liked the first one better. This had too many of the cliche moments I have come to hate.Especially the obvious fate of the fresh faced rookie. damn that pissed me off.
4,Expendables 2: Action Packed,"We really enjoyed ""Expendables 2"". As we watched the first ""Expendables"" prior to the second, I believe the second story had more substance."
4,Old Buddies,The old buddies are back at it. I liked this movie. It was slow in some spots but very packed in the action department. I actually enjoyed this one better than the first Expendables.
3,Not as good as the first,"I never thought there would be a day when I would see Stallone, Arnold, and Bruce in the same film and think to myself, ""Van Damme gave a damn good performance"". And of course Jason Statham is always fun to watch."
3,Good movie,Good Movie. Better than the first. Lot's of action and plenty of great stunts. I think You will enjoy it.
4,dogmom4000,"All the action greats in one movie, what could be more wonderful. Enjoyed the tag lines from some of the stars famous characters."
2,Better than expendables 1 but not that great,Plot was weak. Acting was lacking. The movie tried to make it on action and shart appearances by big name actors
3,Bloody,"I found the killing over the top even for me which is unusual. The dialog was a bit too predictable. However, I still recommendit if u have a 1 1/2 to kill."
3,Poor quality dvd,The movie was good but the dvd that I received was of poor quality. I guess now they are making regular dvd's in poor quality so that you will decide to stop buying them and spend the extra money to get blue ray.
5,bang-bang shoot-em up,Action packed and funny at the same time. Unbelievable story line but this is a bang bang shoot-em up action flick that does not dissapoint.
3,Just Sit Back And Enjoy!,"This is a movie you just sit back and enjoy. Don't try to break it down, don't look for a great story line or acting. Your watching because you like the stars that are in it and the action films they have done."
3,Pretty Lame,This is OK for a group of guys drinking beer and waiting on a game to start. Your wife/girlfriend will make you pay if you make her watch it!The one liners and cameos are pretty good and I am glad to see them still acting and making money. Lots of things getting blown up and people getting shot/knifed/beaten etc. but not too bloody. Sly looks pretty scruffy but maybe that was the idea?
3,eh.....,"I really enjoyed the first Expendable movie. I expected the 2nd one to be atleast somewhat decent. The plot was horrible, didn't make much sense, the acting was horrible compared to the first one. This will be 90 minutes I will NEVER get back. I wasted $8 buying this on blu ray, thought to myself, what a great price, now I know why....it was a really bad movie..."
3,Good Action,It is a nice action flick that has many sentimental favorite action stars! You know they had fun making this flick.
4,like it,this movie is really good but the end fight was to short and jet li wasnt that much in the movie but it was fun to see it
3,Action,It started off slow -- introducing the characters; but it picked up the pace a little. The story was good.
4,expect more than a good team up movie and you'll be disappointed,"It was an entertaining romp through old school action stars. Good for what it was, but only if you go in knowing what to expect."
3,Average,"Bloodier than the first one. Even with the big names, the acting was pretty poor. Constant references to the movies that the others have been in, not necessary if you ask me."
3,good movie,A good shoot em up movie filled with comedy. The movie was good but the plot was better in the first movie.
2,Not for deep thinkers,This movie gave old men the opportunity for old actors to get a paycheck but it was so far fetched it was comical
2,Expendables 2,I don't like Ultraviolet!! You have to open an account with them to get you digital copy!! The movie was awesome !!
2,Generally awful,"Miserable dialog, completely predictable plot, wooden or trite acting. Total waste of more than 100 minutes of the viewer's lives."
1,poor vidio quality,"Very poor vidio quality! HD?? More like an old vhs left in the sun.. Not the first vidio I have streamed from Amazon, but the worst quality. Distroyed the movie as it was bearly watchable. Sometimes could not tell who the actors were... Bad, bad, bad..."
1,This movie was terrible,To have so many high profile or at least once high provide actors the acting was horrible. Would not recommend this movie to anyone.
1,One of the worst movies I've seen in the last decade full of old decaying old men,"The fact that Stallone and all these other have-been actors get paid millions to do crap movies like this is bewildering. It's an offense to our intellectual as moviegoers.This movie is an exact duplicate of the previous, except with even more decaying past action stars like Van Damme and (can you believe it) Chuck Norris. Stallone's face now looks like a chicken on hormones, that man has had so many plastic surgeries and botox that he has become almost unrecognizable, he is just horrible to look at, a true freak. Amazing how these actors just don't know their limits and the difference between aging gracefully vs looking like a rotten old pumpkin.I don't usually review movies, but this one was such a blatant waste of my time that I had to blow off my steam here. And to all these people who have given this gargabe of a movie 5 stars, really Amazon, can you check that they're REALLY not under 13?"
1,Expendable Expendables,"Lives up to its title. Neither the actors, not the movie is worth salvaging or re-using. Must be one of the worst movies of 2011. Fairy tale action; no storyline. Stallone should pay people to see it."
1,Not for anybody older then 12,"This movie is worse then the original, if that is possible. Just stupid, I knew better, but my wife thinks Jason is cute, so ..."
2,Lots of gore,"If you're into that sort of thing, go for it... but the exploding blood splotches got a little tired after the first 5 minutes."
5,Awesome,"One of the best action movies I've seen in a long time. Non stop action from beginning to end! Awesome,"
4,More of the first.,Just more crazy in your face nonstop action and violence that you come to expect from this franchis and I loved every monute of it. It is a guys guy movie so ladies sorry you might want to sit this one out. Turn your brain off and just enjoy the cray ride with all your favorite action stars as they destroy everything in their paths.
3,Eh,Funny to see these actors but predictable just one of those things you felt you had to see if you saw the first one.
2,Bla,I don't know why I ordered this i don't like Stallone this movie is so like him loud obnoxious and stupid.
2,A chaotic mess,I liked the first Expendables. This one is way more out there. A lot of random stuff happening in this one.
3,ruined the first one,This movie really should not have been made. It totally made the first one look bad. Some of the worst acting
4,Not as good as the first,But it still satisfies my lust for good ol' action. As American society is becoming more and more feminized these kind of movies (and men) are dying out. Enjoy them while you can.
4,Action,Enjoyed watching this movie even though the first Expendables was better. It is getting a little hard to believe that these old men could actually physically do some of these scenes. By the way I am older than them.
1,Uhm...,It's basically Twilight for redneck good ol' boys. I can't believe all the good reviews people are leaving. No wonder hollywood makes so many crap films these days. The mindless masses are actually willing to pay for this drivel.
5,Action Packed Thriller!,"The Expendables group is called upon by the Bruce Willis character to locate a case holding a computer program that tells where plutonium is hidden in'Albania. After finding the case they are intercepted by an outlaw group led by Jean Claude Van Damme. He is the leader of the outlaw group. He is actuslly the lead villian. The hoodlums kill a member of the Expendables. The Expendables go on the hunt. The members of the Expendables are played by Sylvester Stallone, Randy Coutuer,Terry Crews, Jason Strathan Arnold Swarzenager, and Chuck Norris. This group finally locates the place where theplutonium is located. As you would expect a tremendous gun battle breaks out. Van Damme and his evil crew go to the airport to transport the plutonium.Another huge battle breaks out. The finale is a huge fight between Stallone and Van Damme. The 2nd Expendables is a wonderful movie. It is well worth what you will pay for the ticket."
1,Garbage,"If I could give this movie 0 stars I would. What a piece of crap!Horrible acting by actors that used to be the S*** back in the day but that was back in the day. When you're in your late 50s early 60s trying to play an action hero today, it's kind of silly not to mention rather stupid.This movie sucked on so many levels.Do not even waste your money on this movie. So so not worth it."
1,NOT VIEWED,A lot of violence and was a bit blurry in HD mode. Would not suggest it to anyone to view.
2,A BUNCH OF OLD STARS WORKING TOGETHER IN A HORRIBLY WRITTEN PLOT,"I rented this movie because I really liked the idea of seeing all the stars together in a great movie. I was greatly disappointed. These stars deserved a better plot but they were placed directly in a ""B"" movie with a director who did not know how to elicit great acting and poorly written lines. I really hated to see them this way, knowing that they had played in ""A+"" rated movies with directors and well-written lines and plots. Such a waste of good talent!"
1,never got it,"I thought i was ordering a dvd I never received dvd,or digital copy or ultraviolet.I do beleive i deserve a refund if i did not get any of this"
1,Not what I exspected!,"This is the dumbest movie I've ever seen. It had it all (good, big name actors, lots of action) except a competent director. The story line could have been a little better, but the director should be sued. Guess he’s just getting started in the profession."
2,Make It Stop,"The first one was fun. A deliciously over-the-top salute to tough guy action stars past. Not great, or even particularly good, cinema, but it was entertaining. This concoction is the remnants of the first movie, thrown into a blender with some of the worst dialogue ever uttered and a large dollop of ""this time it's personal"" testosterone glop and pureed into a visual slurry that will have you wishing you were watching the Gigli Director's Cut. I'm an unabashed fan of Jason Statham and I still think Stallone has something to offer but this is not it. It's hard to have fun when you're stuck in a spasmodic cringe loop."
4,Good movie,The overload or starts and the subtle comedy makes this a good movie to watch. You get what you would expect from this one.
3,liked it,"lots of action I like these types of movies that keep you interested, a little corny in spots but what the heck a fun watch"
3,mediocre,"Stallone, Statham, Li, Arnold, Bruce....and CHUCK NORRIS? I'm glad I bought the first movie in this 'franchise', but even happier that I only rented this one."
3,Expenadables 2,This was okay as an action movie. The first one was better. Too much Arnold not enough Li and Statham.
2,Just another Expendables movie,"Though I wasn't going into the movie expecting much, I thought this movie was far below even the low expectations I had for it."
5,rented it,great movie. full of action.The fact that i have to put 18 words in order to submit a review is ridiculous!! Makes me not want to review anything
4,Good movie,"It is good to see the old timers in action. The one liners were funny. We need more formidable enemies for the expendables like the wise guys of Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, or even Vin Diesel and Mat Damon."
5,great movie,"Exciting 80s or 90s style action flick with big stars, giant explosions, and lots of guns. And the plane is the best character."
2,"Same ol, same ol",Old news. Same ols plot. Needless profanity. Girl wants old guy but guy is afraid of her safety. Don't waste your time.
5,AWESOME!!!,"RECEIVED IT FAST, WATCHED IT AND TOTALLY LOVED IT. ONE OF THE BEST ACTION MOVIE IN A LONG TIME WITH THE BEST ACTION MOVIE STARS!!"
3,Just ok,First one was better. Worth watching if you've seen everything else on amazon. Way too unrealistic. They could've done a better job with the storyline.
2,Tired remake,"Simply a paycheck movie. There are some fun moments when they make fun of each others movie signatures like ""I'll be back"" and others which bring a smile to our face. Having Jean Claude or as I call him Jackass Clod essentially ruins the movie. Let's face it, the guy stinks as an actor and seems to be about as stupid as a stump. The first movie was much better and lots more fun."
3,Yeah,Liked the first 1 better. Not much of a story that I can remember. Too much blowing s*** up if that's what u like then ok but I expected more. Just a parade of older action stars.
4,good,good but not as good as the first! but still alot of action a good choice for anyones Stallone collection
2,Don't waste your time,Unless you like firepower an lots of destruction the weak dialog and foolish plot are not worth much. Time to retire and watch their own fight movies.
2,Low Expectations Unmet,"This movie is supposed to an action movie with lots of big guns causing ultra-violence. However, it doesn't take that much effort to write a plot and choreographic action scenes that make sense. It was like watching a mock up on the history channel show Top Guns."
5,2 thumbs up,"Love this movie! really, I have to add a minimum amount of words? I don't have time for this. Still not enough?"
5,Movie movie,this movie is great. i am so glad it was available right away after release. came quick and got it when planned.
2,"Oh, another fight",Way too much fighting/chases/explosions. It got so tiring! Poor acting too. I guess men would enjoy this more than I did.
3,has beens trying to still make it,disappointed with the plot and one liners. Van Dam sucked as the bad guy. Guess he be good at selling sun glasses.
2,Not good!,Not good. It is not funny anymore and there is not much point watching these series-movies!!!They need to stop.
1,18- 25 yr old market,Looked like a video game. Lots of explosions and exploding machinery. No real story. Not much of a plot. Fits right into that 18-25 year old market.
1,Narcasistic,Lots of bad cameos and bad acting by old action heros. So bad it was if they did not care. The only plus was lots of action.
5,Very fun and entertaining movie!,"This was a very funny, action packed entertaining movie. And I loved all the surprise guest stars! Enjoyed it very much."
4,Typical Stallone movie,It was a pretty good movie. Lots of action and a bit of corny humor injected. I enjoyed it and would recommend it.
3,Meh - Not bad Worth a Watch,"Yes they are mostly all here - all of your favorite action heros from the 80s flicks. Enjoyalbe movie, if sometimes a bit silly - but hey, most action adventure flicks from the 80s were just that. Only thing that really made me go come on what contrived bs was the huge cannon in the nose of the plane. Sorry but that plane would have fallen right apart form the recoil. Anyway, rent it, and you;ll geta chuckle or two, and see the high body count."
3,Good action but too expensive and unnecessarily violent,Product has good action but conversation are dull and unnecessarily violent such as cutting off the head of a dead enemy.
3,Expendables - Ok for a Sunday,This movie had more violence and less plot line than I like but my husband enjoyed it. Ok for a Sunday afternoon as we took down the holiday decorations.
4,GOFAF,I like it because of the Good O' Fashion Action Film where the family can enjoy. Just the good guys vs the bad guys.
4,Did you like the first Expendables?,"If you answered yes, you will like this one too. Same type of cheesy 80's action style movie. Good one liners, lots of action, and lots of explosions. Totally what you'd expect from this genre of movie! Worth the watch if you liked the first one."
3,Okay Flick,"Liked seeing all the action stars together, but the script seemed to be lacking in a a few spots. So it's just okay."
3,A fun throwback movie,"This movie is another good throwback to the action movies of the 80's. All of the big stars of that time get their due here, and all get some pretty funny lines.The story is a little weak and none of the acting will win any awards, but as long as you know what to expect going in, you should have a good time."
3,Good Action Adventure,We both liked the way the movie kept moving. My popcorn was gone before the action really started. set back and enjoy.
4,Flashback,"Excellent seeing the icons from the past come together in an all out action free for all, e specially enjoyed Chuck Norris"
4,The old guys still have it,The old guys still have it. Playing off each others movie quotes was fun. But Jason Stathem was great as this generation's tough guy.
3,Not bad entertainment,"I'm glad I didn't rush to the theatre to see this. Frankly, Sly is getting a little too old to be running around in these action hero parts. He and Arnie should just enjoy retirement and leave the explosions to the younger crowd. That said, it wasn't bad entertainment, but won't be winning any Oscars. If you like Sly and you liked The Expendables, you will probably like this."
2,Ultimately a letdown,"I was enjoying the movie and ready to consider it a four-star flick, until the airport scenes. The last 20 minutes are such a big letdown! The villain, aptly if a little cornily named Vilain, has absolutely no escape plans, and that just doesn't make any sense even in a it-doesn't-need-to-make-any-sense film like this. Also it's another letdown that Jet Li doesn't appear in the bulk of the film, leaving out some of the humor and chemistry. Before the airport scenes I thought I'd watch the film again, but afterwards I immediately returned the rental to Redbox."
3,For the Easily Entertained,The entire movie is a constant flow of cameos by the Hollywood action heros. Story line and plot are so passe that the only thing that keeps one awake is all the noise created by the action heros trying to do each other in.
3,Highly entertaining!,"This movie is way cool, however Amazon should invest more in streaming quality. Even for a non-HD movie the picture quality and resolution was far from been acceptable (a DVD has much more quality then Amazon's streaming). Also, Amazon's web media player is never able to fill my widescreen TV (there are always black edges on both right and left sides of the screen). Moreover, during the movie, the streaming stopped 3 or 4 times (one of the breaks took up to 2min to recover streaming!!!). Since I have already streamed HD movies using my home broadband connection from Netflix and other sources without a problem (good quality and no interruptions), I can conclude that this must be an Amazon issue."
3,Fair.,"They manage to get just about every action actor into this one, but story is weak and action is too contrived."
3,Popcorn Movie!,"All your favorite action stars in one flick! Even Chuck Norris makes a cameo. If you liked the 1st Expendables you will like this movie. Explosions, fight scenes...just a fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously."
1,zzzzz...,"Here we go again, the same old "" billion bullets flying and only the bad guys fall routine "". The magically appearing I'M BACK and TEXAS RANGER with too much beard make-up added nothing to this sad little attempt at movie-making. Hollywierd is running out of ideas and even an all-star cast of has-been's could not save the day.You'd be better off with Mary Poppins!"
4,Fun to watch,Fun movie to watch although the graphics were a little extreme at times. Fun to see all the action players in different roles.
2,"Sure testosterone, but worst than the first","OK, the reason you watch these movies is to put hair on your chest and grunt like a caveman for 1.5 hours.Believe it or not, the first one was better than this one. Chuck Norris just shows up (not giving anything away because he is in the commercials), same with Arnold and Willis. No real rhyme or reason, just out of the blue there they are.Overall if you have a few beers and half watch it, it's fine, but nowhere near a five star movie."
4,"The best action movie that you can watch, if you like action movies","The actor line up here is amazing no one can argue with that. Its your typical man film, explosions, fights etc. Honestly its the best action film I recon you can watch. But, me personally, I'm just a bit sick of these story-less action films. This film knows what it is though, and certain people showing up randomly at key times to ""save the day"" with zero explanation is not even attempted to be hidden here. If you like things blowing up, a mindless action flick, and have a great sound system then go for it, you wont be dissapointed. Just dont go looking for a fantastic story that you will remember a week later."
2,Retire these guys already and don't waste your money,"The first expendables movie was probably more enjoyable for the sheer novelty of seeing all these action stars that I watched over the past 25 years in one movie. Well the novelty has worn off (and maybe I shouldn't have been googling their ages while watching the movie) but after seeing how ridiculous the story was and listening to the often overused one-liners I finally came to the realization that these guys are all laughing to the bank in whats seems to be their last grasp at the movie money tree. They're hoping your money is ""Expendable"" but don't bother funding their botox injections, face lifts and child support payments. I guess I liked it even less than I originally thought."
3,Great movie!!!,"There is plenty of action in this movie, but I think that the ending (fight between stallone and jean claude) should have been more action packed and longer"
4,Silly But Fun,"This flick gathers together most of the over the hill action movie heroes. Of course it's over the top, but enjoyable. The appearance of Chuck Norris was funny, and there were plenty of one liner digs at each other. Seeing these guys age on screen sure makes me feel old."
1,yikes!,"Don't bother, this was terrible to begin with. I expected it to be at least funny, but it was just embarrassing."
4,"Fun, action-packed movie!","Yeah, it's got some corn in it, but overall - we enjoyed it! It was funny, fast and above all - action packed! I recommend it for your next movie night!"
1,Punch drunk splodey fest.,This pile of garbage feels like a seven year old child wrote a movie only using sounds and gesticulations. The action is laughable. Generic stuff laid out for old men in ridiculous situations. Pretty much on par with every Stallone movie. Buy the Raid: Redemption and be the cool AND tasteful gift giver.
1,SHOULD NOT EVEN BE ONE STAR,I have loved most of these actors over the years. This is beyond terrible. I have no more words. So sad!
1,really really BAD!!!,"I liked the first one. It was good, funny, well acted.This one was a disaster. Badly acted, badly written, dumb plot.I wanted to like this movie, but sadly thats impossible."
1,Worst movie I ever saw,"I wish I could get back the hour and a hald I wasted watching this. I pray a third movie isnt made, if so I guarantee no money will be made. Cheesiest lines and pharses throuout the movie. Horrible acting by everyone. Way to much digital blood and spilling. I would give this movie 0 stars but I cant. I just hope people read this and take my review to heart. A part of you dies after you watch this."
1,Absolute Trash,"A complete waste of brain matter -- you are destroying all cells with this trash, poor plot, compounded by the worst acting ever put on the screen - embarrassing! Stay away -- as far as possible!"
1,Turn Brain Off Before Watching,I love action movies but come on man. Kind of sad I had drink a lot of beer to somehow endure this movie.
2,Disappointing,"The storyline does not make any sense. The movie is lacking in plot. So-so acting. Extremely violent. I never saw the first movie. I was excited that these guys were getting together to make this movie. Unfortunately, my excitement died down after the first ten minutes. And I lost interest in this movie. Thumbs down!"
2,Plenty of celebrity without much else,"Just as you'd expect, you'll see bit parts from a range of great actors. The catch? There's little to no direction, the plot is absurdly simply, no character development (at least there was a little in the first), and horrible, non-stop one-liners from films iconic to each actor, respectively. If you are able to remove all thought-process while watching this film, then you'll probably enjoy the limited action it provides. Otherwise, this isn't worth the money or time -- there are plenty of great releases that overshadow this, even amongst the genre of ""mind-numbing action""."
4,"""I'm back""","If you're looking for an exciting actions movie, look elsewhere. If you are a fan of comic book movies and have fond memories of 80's action flicks, you will be entertained.I'm glad Norris got his camera time, but I wouldn't be disappointed if he was not in the next one. It would have been nice for Li's character to have more time as his fight scenes are always entertaining. Statham and Van-Damm showed off their skills. Stallone, Willis, and Schwarzenegger were entertaining yet showing their age. I think Couture is doing pretty good crossing over from fighting to acting.Some of the blood effects were a little over the top for my taste, but other than that I really liked the movie."
3,Action packed,An entertaining movie that kept my attention. Great to see allot of mega stars in one movie. Like The Expendables 1; worth watching.
5,The Expendables 2 (Blue Ray),"It has all everything that a action fan wants. All the great action actors are in one movie. They are worth the salt as they still can perform most of the fighting and action sences. Even the storyline is thin, the fights and action will able to off set the short coming. Just sit back, relax and enjoy the movie."
3,Hard to go wrong with all the action,"Boom, Bang, Blow em up. This movie might have some bad acting but I think the crew made up for it in fight scenes and special effects. Not the best but worth a rental on a slow weekend."
3,Not bad.,"Lots of action but a little cheesy and predictable. It was worth the 3.99, but I won't be buying it."
4,great sequel,"grat seeing all the action stars of the 80's together in one movie,I recommend this anyone who likes action movies."
2,They should of only made one movie,High hopes for an awful movie. Very disappointing. Poor writing and story line with recycled one liners. The story isn't very good and leaves more to be desired.
3,NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL,This one is a little over the top (if that's possible) compaired to the original. The caracters were not as well developed as before. Arnold was just not belieavable and Jet Li dissapeared way too soon. Chuck Norris was OK but could have been left out alltogether. I think the writers and producers tried to include too many aging action stars in one movie and it just did not come together.
3,Expendable 2,I found this movie to be a bit of a let down after how good the first one was notice of a plot left a lot just hanging out there
4,"welcome back, arnold!","this movie was a lot of fun, although a lot of the action was slightly over the top. Not complaining,tho!"
5,Great Movie,The was a lot of hipe about the movie and the big stars in it. Was a little disapointed that Chuck had such a small part in it.
2,More of the same,"I like Statham. And I think it's an interesting idea of Stalone's to get all of the action stars of the last 20 years into one film. It was great to see those guys again. And Statham is always good in everything he does. Since he is playing opposite Stalone, he, Statham, lends credence to what otherwise would have looked totally tawdry. Aside from the inability of Stalone to actually kiss a girl (seen also in the original Expendables), the action is well-done. It's just that the story is barely believable.I know.....who cares? It's all about shooting hundreds of guys, blowing their head off and somehow escaping any kind of wound whatsover. It's ridiculous. But after all....it's just an ""entertainment."""
4,Only way to buy on-line!,"Mother looking to buy in store and agreed easier to get on-line. Arrived sooner than expected and works wonderful. No damage, no problems."
5,Better than the first,"I really liked this one better then the first one. There was more action, more characters and more adventure. Absolutely must see."
3,What You'd Expect,"E 2 was about what I expected. A few more ""old"" action heros got some screen time. Lots of bullets fired with almost ""hero"" damage. If you like this type spoof you'll like Expendables 2"
4,blueray,"love, like first one lot of action, good actors in it, lots of actions, over all good flix, like it!"
3,Just plain fun for the Action/Adventure fan!,"I have to admit, I am concerned with how the youth of our country are affected by the violence and easy killing in games and movies these days. I think we have dehumanized media in general and I do not know what can be done to fix the issues.That said, The Expendables 1 and 2 are major fun for those whom are able to keep the separation of reality and fantasy straight! The campy references to each others previous movie monikers brings a chuckle to the mayhem from time to time. It is exciting to see these action stars all working together and seemingly having fun doing so. The realism of most of the action scenes never enters the realm of plausability. Therefore, this movie becomes total entertainment!"
2,"I like many of these actors, but this movie bombed","I was wondering if it was possible that this movie could really be this bad, with all these A list super hero actors in it, after hearing from others who gave it a bad mention. I just should have passed but like morbid curiosity of watching a train wreck, I couldn't turn away. The plot stunk, the movie was full of shooting and things blowing up and guys getting killed, what else would you expect. I just didn't know how you get all those guys like Sly, Arnold, Bruce, Chuck etc to blend and maybe it just can't happen. If you want ro watch a movie that has all of them in one film that you can see them and enjoy in one movie, then I guess that is a plus, but anything else I just couldn't think of a positive."
5,Great fun,"The Great castLots of ActionI really enjoyed this movie so much, I got both of the DVDs.Wow!"
3,Expendable 2,"Not as good as Expendable, but along the same line of mayhem. Kind of hard to watch, but it has it moments."
4,A little cheesy at times but I would watch it again!,I think it was almost comical on some of the gore in there but that's not a deal breaker. Chuck Norris was Hilarious!!
4,I should have bought it!,"I chose to rent this, but in retrospect I should have bought it! The movie is extremely funny if you have a viewing history of the characters. WARNING: There is a LOT of gratuitous shooting and violence and it is not for young or sensitive viewers. It is also not going to win any awards for story lines or anything else."
2,Watch this if you would like to decrease your IQ,Cheesy one-liners.....no plot......a waste of 90 minutesWas this screenplay written by a group of middle schoolers with anger management issues?
2,old yet,"they will kick your ass. i love the knife fight of jason and this guy from undisputed movie. forgot his name lol though he is good. ""boyka boyka boyka"""
2,bluescat44,"What a boring, predictable show. Really bad, with no intelligent plot. This is one of those shows that you can't wait to end, though if you're under 12-years old you may like all of the action."
2,If you want a good laugh rent this movie.,The plot was terrible the acting was cheesy and the action was funny and corny the only reason I give it too stars because it was cool to see all the old action heroes in one movie the final fight will have you laughing all night long I wonder how much money did they pay Chuck Norris to appear in this film?
1,90 minutes of my life I will never get back,"OK so Jet Li was the best part of the first one, Dolph Lundgren and Jean Claude Van Damme seemed very interesting in this one. So let's focus on Arnold. This movie is jut a misfire from the word go. Chuck Norris was fun but again he was nothing more than a glorified cameo. This was all about Sly and Arnold and the more interesting characters were just not utilized. Even the villains weren't as much fun as in the first one. Don't waste your time!"
3,Expendables 2,I thought this was an entertaining movie. I love Sylvester. The other stars during that era were good too. 3 stars
2,Predictable,I am sorry I rented it. It was a bunch of actors out of their prime trying to make money off their reputation from the past. Waste of time and money.
3,alot of non stop action,The movie was filled with several a list celebrities. The plot was a little over the top and many scenes were unrealistic. But all in all the it was a good action move with some funny lines
3,Misses the mark,"Nowhere near as good as the first. Felt like they just didn't care. Storyline was dull. Typical sequel pitfalls. All those stars, they should have done a better job."
4,"Great, not as good as the first one","Pretty good, all my old favorites were there. Still, get that many action hero's in the same film and the dialog can get pretty stilted. Loved the references all around and thank God for Chuck Norris."
5,movie,"We bought this for our grandson who like action. And we trust Bruce Willis to make good, no bad language and sex movies.He never disappoints us in his films. Too bad we can't say that about some of the others...."
2,Predictable...,"Worse than the first...and that isn't saying a lot. The first one I considered mildly entertaining...this one...not so much...again, not."
3,Not really worth the time,"This movie was predictable, but it did blow a lot of things up and at times was funny. I would not rent again after watching."
2,Just disappointed,"I was looking forward to see this movie. But it is like they did not even try. How can you get bored during an action movie? Well, I did."
2,Not any better than the original Expendables,"Same corny dialog and over-the-top shoot-em-up. Not that anyone should expect differently in a movie like this, but it was supposed to be an improvement over the first. I didn't expect much more, and in that, it didn't disappoint."
2,Meh,"The movie was very predictable, cheesey, and really over-utilized cheesey lines. It was just a shadow of the first movie.Amazon streaming was flawless though!"
2,Almost as bad as the first movie,"With guts and heads flying off.......""to me"" this was a reeeeeely phony movie! Unfortunatley these (with all due respect) gentlemen all of whom I've always liked had some really cheezy lines in this movie and the acting was certainly not the best. I'm just being generous by rating this with two stars."
2,Time to retire!!!,"Bunch of oooold guys wtih way too much make up trying to relive the glory days. Statham still has some appeal and Li is kinda like Dick Clark in that he never ages. Otherwise, dialog was cheesy, Stallone's moves looked more like Paul Blart Mall Cop than Rambo, Schwartzenegger, Norris and Van Dam need botox desperately and the story line is soooo far out there it's completely unbelievable.The action and gore is so over-the-top and unrealistic it's pathetic. Great advertisement opportunity for Ensure, Geritol and Depends though.Sly, the steroids are taking a toll, hang it up buddy, time to enjoy the grandkids."
3,Not as good as the first,"The movie was somewhat suspenseful, but not nearly as action-packed as the first film. With such a star studded cast, most of whom are famous for starring in action/thriller movies, I was expecting to be wow-ed and on the edge of my seat the entire movie. There was a lot of build-up, but the major thrills dont come until the last 15 minutes of the movie."
2,Not one of the best,Was disappointed in movie as acting was seemed forced and not the good interaction between people I thought. For nothing better to do okay.
2,limp-a-long with Rambo,Geriatric Rambo. Lots of stuff getting shot up or blown up. Otherwise it's pretty lame. Not on my Christmas list.
3,The story was OK I guess,"Having all the other action figures in it was amusing but this story I found was heavy on blood spray and a bit light on a predictable plot. It was ok, I guess but this was also from hubby who was the one who wanted to see the movie in the first place. He was disappointed - I think the first one was better."
4,expendables 2,I have The Expendable and like the action and content looking forward to watching this one as soon as I can find some time.
3,Predictable,The first one didn't try so hard. Cameos should be funny but just seem ridiculous. Please don't make a third one.
3,silly action movie,A lot of the movie does not make sense. If you are looking for a good plot this is not the movie for you. But there is plenty of action from a lot of great ageing action stars. Lots of 1 liners and some light hearted jabs. It was still worth watching once.
4,Much better than the first one,"More action/explosion/action stars. Van Damme did great as a villain. Chuck Norris was a nice humorous addition. All around, they gave the cameos more screen time. As a girl, I really enjoyed this manly movie. It helped that there was less romance this time around. I certainly did not intentionally watch an action movie for the romance. It was a fun watch and I think most guys will like it. It had some good lines from your classic action heroes :-P"
4,very enjoyable movie,If you a person from this generation of action heroes then this movie is for you. I thought this was bettrr than the first one.
3,Meh...,"A decent mindless action flick. When Jean Claude is one of the best actors in your line-up, don't expect an oscar nomination..."
2,Boring,I liked the first one. Not for the story line. Only the action. Couldn't get into this movie at all. Only good part was with Mr A.S.
3,Explosions and shooting,"As an action movie I thought it was decent, it delivered what I expected:Stuff exploding and lots of shooting and fighting. Not going to win any major awards, but if just looking for cheap thrills and silly one liners, you will be happy"
4,excellent movie,"I liked the movie,it was very Hollywood action packed. The quality of the video and audio was excellent and I think so far that it was worth buying amazon prime."
3,"Grips, Grunts and Groans","""The Expendables 2"" (2012) delivers efficient comic-book heroics with self-deprecating flair - easily surpassing its dull predecessor. Sly and the Family Retro reunite for an action-filled summit meeting that benefits from a tighter script and Simon West's assured direction. Jean-Claude Van Damme makes a worthy Stallone adversary. Though scheduling conflicts prevented Jet Li from delivering more kicks, another star-filled sequel is in the works."
5,The Love Song To Action Movies Continues,"The expendables was a love song to action movies of the 80's and 90's and this movie continues the greatness. With Jean Claude van Damme playing the villain almost like he was born to do it, and Chuck Norris (legendary badass) making appearances, the awesomeness has increased by around 75%. So many in jokes for fans of these movies, and even if you are not a fan, you can still appreciate the film in its own right (the references to Chuck Norris facts is a laugh out loud moment).But like with the first movie, this film goes deeper and has substance to go with the flashiness. Beyond all the explosions and mayhem, there is a real story that involves the audience. With all of these factors, you can't go wrong with this film!"
1,This movie is ass.,"Expendables one is worth watching. This movie attempts irony in it's kitschy self awareness and fails at it, life, the universe, and everything.Fortunately my sister has terrible taste in movies so christmas decisions don't tax my smouldering and already overtaxed remnants of an excuse for a functional brain."
4,Where is my other sock?,I took my socks off during the movie because my feet were hot and now I can't find one of them
3,non stop action.... dialog could have been better,it was great seeing all the headline action actors in one moviethe first one was better then this sequel
4,Cheezy but entertaining.,It is rare to see so many action adventure stars in one movie. Of couse the basic plots are always far fetched but that isn't why you watch those kind of movies. Long on action and no shortages of amunitions or exposives as well as a lot of dead bad guys makes it anything but a sleeper. Worth the prce and entertaing too.
4,Actionman,held my interest but boy are these guys getting old hopefully they come out with another film soon could use some more action packed films
5,Loved it,"My husband and I really enjoyed this movie, it was good for the both of us not just a man flic"
4,Good movie!,Full of action and most hollywoodfamous actors.even most of themthey are old actors but you still enjoythe action if you like action and adventuremovies.
2,"Statham's Performance ""Saved"" This Flick","The body count was too low, not enough bad guys were killed. Oh Yea, and there needs to be more blood splattering all over the place when bad guys are shot !"
3,"Okay, but not as good as the first","Just felt like it had been ""phoned in"". Jean Claude was not charismatic or scary enough. I think Rutger Hauer, Steven Berkoff or Alan Rickman would have been scarier. But I did love the Chuck Norris cameos! :)"
4,Fun!,We watched this movie right after watching the first one. If you liked all of the older Stallone movies you will like this one. The movie features other action heros from the past as well. There is some light humor thrown in (references to past action hero lines). The movie is not going to win any awards or anything but all in all it is fun to watch....we really enjoyed it.
3,Review,Thought it was okay...there were too many cheesy one liners that referredTo the different characters roles in other movies. Some of the actorsAre just getting WAY to old to be playing ACTION HEROS.
4,Saw the movie. On my TV the CD was great good movie,"Haven't found what i,m going to download the ultraviolet copy too yet??? I`d like to have it on something that I will have for awhile"
4,too much fun,"I loved this movie. It was a lot of fun. (spoiler) I thought the think with the dead sniper kid was not necessary and if it was not for that I would give this five stars. I loved the chemistry between all the actors. The silly things, the crazy action The funny things painted on the custom A-Team style planes and siege vehicles. I am so ready for the third movie. Part of my dream add on cast members I'm actually getting (Jackie Chan) but if I could beg the gods of movie making I would have to ask for Mr. T and Lucy Lawless"
2,More of a comedy,Amazon quality was great.Movie could have been OK if they had left out stallone. Horrible. All Stallone does is mumble incomprehensible lines and shoot a revolver by slapping the gun. Lame.
4,Like the first on steroids,Funnier and even more unbelievable (where did that plane come from?) than the first. Did not disappoint. Chuck and JCVD were great additions to the already action packed geezer brigade.
3,Not as good as the first,The storyline for this movie was okay. The acting was still as bad as or worse than the first part. Action was also not as good. This one I'd wait until HBO for.
2,Silly,"Like I said, ""just plain silly."" Can not believe I sat through the whole thing. I am sure if I will ever watch another Stallone movie because of this one."
3,Making movies for the money,"Great if you like to see blow up. The movie goes too far trying to give each ""hero"" his moment in the sun. Nothing you haven't seen time and time again. A little hard to stay interested at times."
5,Excellent gift,I bought this movie for hubby's Christmas and he loved it! The movie arrived quickly and was packaged well. A good shoot-em-up movie with all of his favorite action heros.
2,Better watch it on Blu-ray,"I watch lots of moves lately including those instant. Having FIOS 25/25Mbps internet link I take advantage of watching in HD which has always been much better comparing to standard definition.The Expandables is an exception. This move is made grainy for purpose by producer like it has been shot on the film. Its ok when you watch it in theatre or on Blu ray. But on instant it is just terrible. Because of granurality, video compression makes picture unacceptable in quality unlike other movies I watched instant. This movie and similar should not be even advertized to watch instantly unless link between server and user is guaranteed to be 75Mbps or better which is not a case. Do not waste time watching this movie instantly. You might be disappointed."
5,I thought it was great. I hope there is a part 3,"If you like lots of fast action and suspense, this is the movie to watch.I hope there is a part 3."
5,Much better than the first Expendables,"This edition of the Expendables was much better than the first. The production values were better and the story was more fun to watch unfold. Lots of great actors in this one, with the one liners from other movies. I would say this was a much more enjoyable movie."
5,Excellent sequel,Excellent sequel There aren't many movies that have sequels that I like but this is one of them. The action is intense and the adrenaline is pumping for this one.
1,BORING!!!!!,"The whole Expendables 2 experience could be summed into one word... BORING!!! Let's pray that Stallone isn't given a green-light from Hollywood to film another! Expendables 2 amounts to no more than shallow acting, horrible storytelling, and extremely over exaggerated action sequences. I lost precious time and money with this movie. Consider this your warning and don't waste your precious resources either!"
1,Lacking in every categrory,"I am a fan of straight up mindless action. However, even this was too much for me. There was almost no point to the entire movie. No memorable dialogue. Nothing of interest whatsoever. I wouldn't watch it again if you paid me."
1,If a fourteen year old was asked to write a movie this would be it.,You get all these big time actors and the interaction is so lame. It's like they blew the budget on the actors and had no money left for the script.
1,good actors...poor story line...was difficult to watch to the end,"Loved the first one. Sequel was challenging to watch. I wouldn't have watched it to the end if I hadn't paid for the HD rental. Looking back, I should have cut my losses after the first 15 minutes. I will watch other movies by these actors but no future expendables for me"
1,Tried 3 Times to Get Throught it. FAIL.,"Watched ""The Expendables"" when released and not impressed but watchable, so rented this in hopes of non-stop action. Nope. Have now tried 3 times to watch it and always turn it off or fall asleep. ""Contrived"" comes to mind, too contrived. With cast of characters should just have been better. Had its moments but overall a waste of my time and money. Target audience? I not sure. Date movie? Nope. Under 30 males?? Cast just too old. And did I mention the dialogue?? Terrible. Not recommended."
1,Awful,"Even if you like mindless action films, you will find this a waste of time and money. Poorly written, bad acting."
1,Lots of action but the acting isn't so good,There is a lot of action in this movie but the acting is not good. I did not enjoy this movie.
3,It was just OK,"Yes there was action and yes there was cameo appearances from every action star, but overall it was not very good."
4,Good action flick,Good action lots of guns and explosions. Everything you want in an action flick. Some hot chicks would have been nice
4,Great movie,"I can really think of only one word that best describes this movie ""EXPLOSIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!""It does have some good comedy to it but if you don't like explosions this is no your movie."
3,Mindless fun,Watch it for the cameo appearances in HD with the volume up loud... and microwave 2 bags of popcorn. I forgot the plot before the movie even started... but that is not why you watch this movie.
2,Expendables 2 review,The dialog is extremely corny and the plot is so predictable it is laughable. It is more a farce than an action flick.
3,It's okay.,"Kinda cheesy. Too many character puns. The Rattlesnake/ Chuck Norris joke was pretty lame. Other than that, the explosions and ass kicking was cool."
2,Massive missed opportunity.,"The Expendables franchise continues to be less of a love letter to the kickass actioners of the 80s and 90s and more of a crude teenage sex poem to the stuff lining the bottom of the Walmart bargain bins. Stallone seems content to just rest on the laurels of the concept, and both times the execution ends up feeling as lifeless as half of the cast's respective leathery faces. Instead of doing something interesting with the established and well-worn conventions and cliches, Sly's just fine with laying down and making snow angels in them. And though tons of stuff blows up, none of the action is even any good, which, in this case, is like screwing up the ground beef on a hamburger."
5,Excellent movie!,"No sex, no nudity, and mild language! What a refreshing surprise. Leave it to Chuck Norris to show us again that those aren't needed to make a wonderful film!"
2,Same ole same ole,"Unless you like these wash ups, not the best but I do and thus rented it.Stallone looks a bit on the funny side."
3,Expendable's 2 review.,This movie has plenty of action. There are very seldom times where there aren't guns blazing and blood flying around. Overall it is pretty good. There are a lot of cheesy moments which are expected with the cast. Worth checking out if your into a lot if gunfire and overaged actors.
3,errr ummmmm,"hmmmm, Rambo in fully throttle? I am still not to sure half the time what the plot is in these movies. Am I watching Rambo? Rocky? or one of the other many movies Sly has come up with? So much action and yet it never seems to go anywhere except.....Bad guy dead..... good guys come out on top and minor losses.....AGAIN. Make a movie where all the heroes die and the bad guy becomes the good guy in the end by taking his own life?? sounds weird."
4,Good Action,"Pretty good movie, the action was really good and I enjoyed all the characters too... Well worth 3.99, I would rent again !!"
3,Expendable 2,I enjoyed the cast. The movie itself was tongue in cheek but the humor by the cast made it enjoyable. I did not get a good connection and the picture quality was not very good but it was viewable.
2,Pathetic,These guys are trying too hard. Statham is the only reason to watch this movie. His fight scenes start to make up for everybody else.
3,Expendables 2,"I thought it was overdone and poor dialogue. However, my 11 year old grandson loved it, and watched it again."
2,Lame,Very contrived. Poor plot. Not as fun as the first. Lots of action but it never really made any sense.
3,Eh,The first one was funnier. This one was just ridiculous! The only redeeming quality was Chuck Norris' presence... but even his jokes were forced.
5,review on Expendables 2,"It was a very fast paced, action packed movie with all the stars I grew up with! I was not dissappointed."
3,What you thought,"This movie was what I thought it was going to be over the top with bad acting, with that in mind good movie for 4 bucks. If you thought this was going to be some else than you did not pay close attention to the first movie or did not see it. Somethings you have to take as is."
5,Destroy the enemy!,"If your a fan of seeing the bad guys get whats coming to them (seems to be a common trend lately) ya gotta watch both Expendables. Unlike years past, todays action flicks seem to have the same agenda, annihilate the enemy! So many movies today jumping on the bandwagon, which I think is awesome. Taken comes to mind. Couldnt stand watching some movies in the past ""Black Hawk Down"" comes to mind, where the good guys are getting destroyed......yes I understand it was based on true events, but the point is there are so many movies where the bad guys wreak havoc."
3,"Good Cast, made on the cheap","Good Cast, made on the cheap. Seems like a cheaply made movie. It's entertaining if you like action movies. If you've seen the first one, you'll know what to expect."
3,Explosions and muscle,"There's only one redeeming thing about this movie, the blood splatter from the bodies is awesome! The dialogue gets in the way of the bullets and is delivered worse than a 500 pund gravity bomb."
3,The Expendables,Some action. sort of disjointed. Older actors trying to be their younger selves. Hard to believe. I wouldn't buy again.
3,Exactly what you expect.,"If you watch this expecting an intelligently woven tale, you'll be extremely disappointed. But if you expect goofy, throwaway lines, references to past films the actors have been in and lots of things being blown up, you'll be satisfied. It's worth an evening of guilty pleasure, action and laughs. Watch for a hysterical scene with Chuck Norris!"
5,action,"Favorite action heros, especially Chuck Norris. Enough action and and comedy that makes for a very entertaining 2 hours of watching."
4,Tons of action,"The plot was typical. The fun references, and cameos brought a chuckle. And enough violence to take the edge off after a frustrating day at work."
3,Far Fetched,"This movie stretches ""suspension of disbelief"" credibility way too far. There were battle scenes where our heroes are about to be eliminated by the armies of bad guys, when all of a sudden a hero who had been quickly introduced earlier comes form out of the blue to save the day. The heroes always outrun the machine gun bullets, while the bad guys die like lemmings. A high point of the film are the inside jokes, and fun the stars poke at each other. The film is enjoyable to watch, but you have to disregard logic too often."
3,Just another episode...,"The first movie was better, this one could have stayed dormant. Had too many scenes that have been viewed before."
4,Better than the first one!!,"If you were to go in this movie thinking it's a 80s Action Flick movie, you're going to enjoy this movie. These movie is a throwback to the 80s action flick movies, with muscular men, one liners, LOTS of explosions, and every action star of the 80s. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis have bigger roles in this movie, and even throwing in Chuck Norris with the team (well, not really).This is definitely better than the first one with lovable characters, better action sequences, better pacing, and is a good time. It's no masterpiece, but if you a recent movie that is a throwback to the 80s action flick movies, this is it. Can't wait for them to make a sequel."
5,Far better than the original,Actual plot and storytelling. Several characters are show more in-depth. Great cameo by another star toward the end. Skip the first and watch this one!
5,LOVE IT!!,This movie was just as awsome as the first one! I plan to order both for my library collection :)
2,give it a rest,"I use to love action movies,but this is not one of them. ""Hollyweird"" and the ""screen writing guild"" seem think they are being creative by adding cameo's actor like Norris,Willis and Schwarzenegger . Sorry ""I willn't be back for more""!"
3,"Expendable, too","2.7 starsLess fun than I expected. Stallone seems to get worse as an actor with every movie, and his only good move here is giving Statham a lot of screen time. He adds some humor to a weak plot and weaker script, and no amount of stars can rescue the hammy dialogue.Lots of shooting etc but somehow the action left me flat, and after this was over it felt like cotton candy, no substance at all and barely a memory.With so many good action flicks made in the past few years, this one is truly expendable."
3,"Good Rental, glad I didn't buy it.","Pokes fun at itself, while still delivering the action, the stars, and the chortles. This and a frozen pizza, you got yourself a cheap dinner and movie night."
3,"Much Violence, Little Plot","If you like seeing things blown up and a lot of gunfire, this is your movie. The plot is so thin as to be non-existant, but hey, what did you expect and the orginal ""Expendables""?"
5,Nice Sequel,Loved it. Great action movie like the first one. Favorite part is when chuck norris comes in and take out everything by himself and then they make the chuck norris joke. Hillarious. They should have made the movie a little bit longer but oh well. It was still good.
4,Great cast!!!,"Action, humor, and a cast that never lets you down. All this in the sequel that doesn't feel like a follow up!"
4,Good Explosions!,"If you just like movies with explosions, this is a good one. My son wanted it for Christmas and he was happy to get it!"
3,Expected Fun,This is no great movie. But if youy want to see your favorite old action heroes in crazy silly action this movie is for you. I knew what to expect and thoiught it was fun
3,The Expendables 2 [DVD],I gave it only a three star rateing because I felt parts fo the movie were too grafficly violent. Would not recomend for younger audience.
2,Movie Review,"As a film, this movie was horrible.However, that being said, if you are in the mood for a mindless, shooter and have an hour or so to waste on a popcorn flick, I would suggest it, otherwise the hour or so of your life."
2,Ridiculously Cheesy,"I expected a little bit of cheese factor, but this was over the top. Glad I didn't waste more money on it by seeing it in the theaters."
3,Meh,"A great cast, lots of violence, but terrible dialogue and a general sense of wasted talent. I hoped for more."
3,Okay,"I was expecting more from the huge starcast of the movie. I felt, Rocky was a better director for the expendables franchisee."
4,Great action! Corny catch phases! and LOUD!,"Expendables 2 is really all about how may celebrity action stars they can fit into one movie and still give it some sort of continuity. If you are an action junky, like myself, and you aren't considering this for your library, then you may want to start looking for quieter genres (like romantic-comedies or something).My only downer for this movie (seen in Theater and on BR), is that it seems to be a steady stream of LOUD with no real time for your ears to recover. Maybe it's just me, but the first one didn't have that problem."
3,audio not great,"Audio over Roku was not great. Movie was Ok, not as good as the first one. Didn't expect too much though."
3,Good deal but IMHO not as good as the 1st,"I ordered this movie not seen thinking it was going to be as good as the original but it seemed a lil video gameish with all of the blood squirting out of everyone they shoot and no matter how many people fire at them seems no one ever dies? Chuck Norris appears like the next messiah in this, kind corny. 3 out of 5 for E2."
3,Great Movie,With all the action hero's from the past in one big movie you cant go wrong. I gave it 3 stars because the story line was corny but the action was great.
3,"Action, not reality","This movie was a nonstop action movie, but some of the sequences were totally absurd and not based in reality. It was fun to see all the old character actors popping up along the way. I would recommend this to someone wanting to kill two hours :~)"
5,excellent movie better than the original,this movie is a great action movie for everyone who enjoyed these stars in their many movies its awesome to see them all together
4,Explosive,"massive action packed footage. With hardly any moments of silence or boring parts. Epic cast of crew from numerous films working together on one film. Although the story line could have used some additonal plots, the overal action made it a great GUY movie."
4,Fun for the whole family,"Hokey plot, but fun to see the ""old"" actors reviving their past characters. Done without need for gross images or language."
1,Terrible Movie,Don't waste your time or money on this movie. Everything about this movie was terrible. Watch it when its free on netflix.
2,Automatically pauses,"Went on pause 3 times without me pausing the movie.Only by pressing play multiple times did it start again..Had to restart from the beginning, then it ran through without a hitch."
3,Plenty of action!,"If you like action,this is the movie for you!! Won't win an academy award any time soon! I give it 3 stars."
1,"Sad, sad, sad.","Sad, very sad sequel. Liked original, but nothing the least bit original or interesting aboutthis version. Pathetic, non-sensical dialogue; plot predictable by grade schooler; just moreviolence for supposed good causes. Some humor, though, which was welcome. Adefinite NOT See."
1,HD? more like LD,"Low definition. Like watching an old show from the '70s, the picture was so blurry.The movie was okay, though."
3,Old Men Never Die,"Here's a cast of guys that are getting long in the tooth that manage to kill hundreds while only getting a few wounds themselves. It's amazing that the bad guys are standing 30 feet from our heroes, pumping out thousands of rounds and the good guys are doing the same and the bad guys are the ones getting blown away. While it's nice seeing all the old faces together, it's way to full of old movie cliches and references to their roles in other movies. If you like machine gun fire and mayhem followed by lulls in the action and then back to the machine gun fire then it's for you. It got a bit tiresome after awhile."
4,Old fashioned action fun,"If you want a good story and top notch acting then this isn't for you. If you want to see a lot of guns, knifes, bombs and such then look no further. It is entertaining from beginning to end with only a short slow point in the middle. It is like watching the classic action movies from decades ago when these guys looked in their prime. They may not look it anymore, but they deliver the movie that they used to."
5,Expendables 2,"Enjoyed Expendables 1, 2 is just as good. Lots of action. Lots of notable stars. A little violent but this is the movies right."
1,Couldn't have been worse...,"Why, Dolph Lundgren, does the audio not match up with your lips... ever? Enough said. Well I'll say a little more - Jason Statham was the only person acting in this movie. He gets a pass."
3,Stallone,"I was hoping it would be as good as the first, but I was disappointed. It was a let down from the first one. Only three stars for me."
2,BOO !,"I don't know why they even made a #2 , if I had known it was this bad I never would have ordered it ."
3,Cheesy but entertaining,"Well, what can you say! Some good scenes here and there, and the guys try hard to act and say a few jokes.Kind of dumb plot. Overall, entertaining!"
3,it is ok,"We thought this movie was good and my husband liked it better than me. I can't stand looking at Jean Claude van Damme during this movie and his plastic surgeon should be brought up on charges! The story was okay and unbelievable. it was funny more than I thought it would be and it was violent but not as much as I thought it would be. Sequels have a way of becoming more violent then the first action flick. I think the actors did a great job and the cameos were worth watching this movie. They were hilarious and sarcastic and it was a total guy's flick minus no nudity. So it's okay, worth seeing but don't have your hopes too high."
4,Pretty Good Movie,Its a good movie for what it is. If you want to see things die then you've found the right movie!
4,Way better than the first one,"The Expendables 2 stopped taking itself on any level of serious unlike in 1, so it was a fun romp. Will watch it again."
2,Such a waste!,"I've always liked these guys, even lone wolf, however, this movie was an abuse of their former selves, and thus me. Soredogs"
2,"How do rate something ""I don't know""?","I never got a chance to watch this movie. It was the first time I have ever had trouble instant streaming through amazon. It would take forever to load a section, play for a minute and then start the loading process again. By the time I got back to it, the rental had expired. I am very disappointed and I can't see to find where to report something like that to amazon.com."
1,Terrible!,"Really bad! Not much more to be said about it! It should've been called ""The Have Beens' Last Hourah"". Don't waist your time...."
1,Yes they are famous and back in a single movie but this one is terrible,This is one terrible movie. It's just kind of a silly movie with no real plot. I found that the group of us just started talking over the movie after a while. Could have been good but just not worth paying for.
2,MY GRADE: C plus.,"There's something missing in this follow up to the enjoyable Expendables 1. Overall it felt as if the story and characters relied too much on cookie cutter formulas taking a backseat to the action sequences. It also felt like the large ensemble cast was poorly juggled compared to the first film.Speaking of that ensemble there's a large cast which shows that doesn't always make a memorable film: Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jason Statham, Liam Hemsworth, Jet Li, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Dolph Lundgren and Chuck Norris.Again, quite the disappointment.The budget was $100M and it made over $315M at the Box Office.SOUND: C plus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: C plus to B minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C plus to B minus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: C minus; ACTION SEQUENCES: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: mid December 2012; OVERALL GRADE: C plus."
2,i've never seen worse makeup,"the plot was kinda stupid, the action scences were silly bloody and the makeup on the actors was terrible. they looked like cheap plastic dolls. glad i didn't pay good money for this."
2,bad movie,time for some of these guys to retirenot worth the price. and its crazy to have to have a certain number of words in the review
2,Easily missed!,The first Expendables movie was interesting to see all the past action hero's come together and poke a little fun at themselves. But this just turned into a total farce and these guys are either not good enough actors to carry off the comedic aspect or were embarrassed and just not trying.
3,first one was prob a little better,"Randy Couture is an awesome fighter and even a good sports anouncer, but acting is definitely not his thing. He ruined the first movie for me. Everyone in the movie has a type of character that they act out. Randy doesn't at all because he can't act. This movie he definitely has fewer lines, but he still sucks. lol.Aside from that, it was a pretty cool story and had some good action scenes. But seriously, one really bad actor ruins a movie for me."
4,Good shoot em up,Good romp!!!! Not rocket science but good fun with a twist. A good way to spend a quiet Christmas wiith my husband.
4,Expendables a fun shoot m up,"While no academy awards will be given, it is full of action, humor, and camaraderie. I hope they do more of them."
4,funny!,"If you watch this movie thinking it will be a serious story or serious martial arts action, go elsewhere. There is action and martial arts, yes, and a reasonable story, but the drop-lines and humor are where it's at. If you remember Stallone's movies, Willis' movies, and Schwarzzeneger (sp) movies and their key phrases and you watch this movie with a huge grain of salt, then you will enjoy this movie. I laughed my ass off."
5,Great Movie...But,"Don't expect more than guns, explosions, and marginal acting....it's a great action movie. The Amazon On Demand quality was absolutely horrible. I felt like I was watching a movie filmed in 1950 viewed on a TV made in 1980."
4,So much better than the 1st movie!,"Take the famous kick-ass men from action movies, mix it with nice humor, make it better than the first movie and you'll get Expendables 2. As much as I enjoyed it, I did not love it, but I am looking forward for the third installment! It will be a real shame if they end movies right here. Hope in third movie they will also have as much humor as in this part! Overall it is a very good, kick-ass action movie!"
1,Don't watch it,"Totally forgettable and not worth 3 cents, much less what it cost to rent. Most of the cast should gracefully retire."
1,Awful-Almost turned it off,"Bad, bad, bad movie. Acting is horrible. Jokes are old and repetitive. Sly, Dolph and Jet are extremely hard to understand. Sly looks like he may have had a stroke in this movie.CGI is unrealistic on blu-ray. Plot is incoherent. Jason Statham and the young kid are the only good things about this horrible movie"
3,Good thing i rented instead of bought it.,"Was expecting a better fight with JCVD. Jet Li's role was too short. Even with all the extra character appearances, I think I like the first one better."
4,"As usual, the first one is best","While I really liked the first one, I expected the follow up to be as good or better. While it had plenty of action, it was, for me, just a little over the top. I think they tried too hard to outdo themselves and the story line fell short of delivering a great movie. The cast was great, just a little too many flashbacks to the stars old movies and punch lines. While watching I kept waiting for it to really get going on a new story line, but it never did. Hence, my 4 star rating."
5,spot on classic action!!!,"stallone never dissapoints as he brings this classic team back for another round. great story, great action, and funny moments. only dissapointment to me was that jet li didnt have a bigger part fotr the rest of this film for he's only at the beginning. other then that it was awsome seeing stallone duke it out with van dam!!! very highly recommended movie."
4,Entertaining,I saw the 1st one and I enjoyed it. This was entertaining also. I love to see the cameos. All of our heroes however are getting old and it's time to find new action adventure heroes
5,A favorite,"One of our favorite movies! Watch it all the time....marathon movies, it's in there! Love that the old guys are working together!"
3,Expendables 2,"It's a hands down guy flick just like the first one, which I don't mind watching with the hubby. Packed full of big names but I can't help but wonder how much plastic surgery these guys have had. They always look surprised!"
3,"More bombs, blood and guts than plot.","Typical ""blow up the bad guys"" movie. Action movies these days have gotten too predictable. This one, like others, lacks a good plot. You never really get attached to the characters, and like me, if you're husband saw the first movie, but you didn't, you get no information on who the characters are, or why some of them dislike one another. I found it had bad special effects, little plot, and was fairly boring."
3,Stallone,Great movie go see it a lot of action as always in a Stallone . You should go see it .i rate it at 3 stars
3,movie,good action movie. lots of good actors. not the best movie I have ever watched but definitely entertaining. worth watching once.
5,Excellent Network Security Book,"""Network Security: The complete Reference"" is an excellent book for security and network professionals alike. This book comes very close to living up to its ambitious title. It covers almost everything. Network architecture, operating system security, risk assessment, security polices and writing secure code and everything between are covered. This is an excellent reference book for all security conscious IT professionals."
4,Good case - should have used a magnetic-snap closure!,"This is a very well constructed case, manufactured by Ericsson. It completely covers (and therefore protects) your Ericsson T28 or T39 phone, except for the antenna, which protrudes out of it. The only drawback in my opinion is that this case uses a velcro closure, which is noisy. I would have preferred a magnetic-snap closure, which is quieter. This is especially useful if you are in a meeting, and wish to divert an incoming call to voicemail. Since you need to open the case to get to the phone, the velcro is disturbing, a magnetic closure would be be much better."
1,Unexpected,"I was very disappointed with this item. It is too small and the image makes it appear as if its not. If you have a lot of makeup it is pretty much useless, However, if you have a teenage daughter, this would be perfect due to the fact it does not hold much."
1,Too skinny,"I ordered the 22"" Trico 17-220 Teflon Blade Refill along with the 26"" version for my 2008 Honda Odyssey. These were what was recommended by Amazon's auto parts look-up system. I have the OEM wiper blades. The length is correct but the width is not, so I sent them back. The Trico 17-260 and 17-220 are 1/4"" wide (actually about 9/32"") or 7 mm. What I need is 3/8"" or 9mm. It's too bad Trico doesn't put the width of their wiper refills on the on-line info or on the package. It is also too bad that the auto-parts look-up doesn't distinguish between the skinny and wide differences."
2,Streaks & Skips within 2 months,"While these wiper blades may be a good value, better to look for something different. Made the mistake of buying two sets, one car started skipping almost immediately after installation. The second car, within a couple"
4,Does what it's supposed to do,"I bought this to replace the blade on my Honda Odyssey, rather than paying much more to replace the whole arm. They recommend replacing the blade at least twice a year but because of the expense I was doing it only when it started streaking. On our last trip, the blade was making an irritating noise as it scraped across the windshield, although it wasn't streaking. So, I thought I'd try this approach instead.The blade arrived promptly with Amazon Prime shipping (in a box about 100 times its size!) and I had no trouble removing the old blade and inserting the new one. Yesterday it rained pretty hard so had a chance to use it. No noise, no streaks. Works as advertised. If it holds up in icy winter weather, I'll use these to replace the blades on a regular basis now.I would have given it 5 stars but the price still seems a little high."
1,Cannot recommend,"Single blade with a much thinner blade than the originals so it will not last very long, and a pair will cost almost $17. You can do better, even on amazon. Keep shopping for this item."
1,don't trust Amazon,"When Amazon says they will fit your car, they only mean they are the right length. It does not mean that they will fit the blades that are on your car. The product is good, but I had to replace the blade to get one that would fit. These are 6mm wide and the originals on my car were 8mm wide."
4,A decadent delight,"An old book of a much forgotten ""illustrator"". Think Aubrey Beardsley meets Lady Gaga and had a son= Alastair. Dont miss this bargain if you like black and white strong graphic work."
4,Good version of the story,"I watched this movie on television when I was young. It was the first time I was introduced to the story by Jean Webster. I had to read it as soon as I saw the movie. Since then I have been trying to find it for my children to watch. I have seen the Mary Pickford version and the Fred Astaire version and they were very good. However, those versions didn't stay true to the novel. There is even a japanese version, but it is too long for my attention span. This is a good movie to introduce the novel to younger people."
5,"Good deal, good price, great sound","Not my first set of outdoor speakers, but much better than the BOSE outdoors I had previously. Price was almost half of retail, and sound is great. My friends, the birds, the bears and the other animal in the neighborhood all seem to enjoy my smooth jazz CD's on the outdoor speakers."
3,not impressed,i guess you get what u paid for. may be a little less.no real bass at all. sound is kinda flat. hope it will at least weather.
4,Do what they are suppose to... at a great price,"The speakers are great, do what they are suppose, sound strong, and priced well. I recommend highly."
5,Great speakers for the price,"I bought these speakers for my pool area out back and all I can say is ""Awesome"". Some people say that the bass response is not that great but I'm here to tell you, and I'm a bass head, that for the price you can't ask for much more. If you're able to position one or both near a corner you will be amazed by the bass response. Everything from Jimmy Buffett to Eminem sounds great. Don't sell yourself short and spend a lot of money on big bulky outdoor speakers, these will do what you need them to do and more. Hope this helps."
2,Read the fine print,"EARGENEI purchased this product from Amazon because it was a little less expensive than from my previous supplier if ordered in a large enough quantity to take care of the shipping charges. However, when the product arrived I found that the bottle size to be only half the size I had been getting so that it turned out to be more expensive than before. I went back and checked my original order and no mention of size was mentioned. Finally, by enlarging the bottle of Eargene in my order I was able to read one half ounce. That was in contrast to the one ounce bottles I had been buying. Next time I will be more attentive to the size I am ordering. Thank you, Pat Henry"
5,No more ear itch,A bit on a Q-tip every morning and my ears don't itch when I put my hearing aids in.
4,Good Product,"This product has a lot of good features, especially for business users. For most home users, I would recommend something else such as Microsoft Office, but for businesses, this product is hard to surpass."
5,wont you come on over valerie.....,"great cd...I'm going to have to buy more of the zutons. Very riff centric voicings and phrasings, love it.."
5,Great Band!!,"First saw the Zutons on Palladia TV playing one of the festivals. I thought they sounded great and ordered a copy of ""Tired of Hanging Around"". Like it so much I ended up ordering ""You Can Do Anything"" and ""Who Killed......the Zutons"". Being an old rock guitarist, the first thing that caught my ear was the wealth of great guitar tones. Everything from beautiful clean to tube amp crunch. Catchy songs with great lyrics, great raspy vocals, tight rythm section and great saxophone fills. The Zutons are like a really great musical soup! If you want to see some killer footage pull up Youtube and look for the Zutons live from Abbey Road or pull up just about any of their live versions of ""Valerie"". I really hope we get to see this band doing a U.S. tour!"
4,I haven't heard it yet but...,".. I'm sure it is going to be as great as I thought they're first one was/still is. Basically I'm writitng in response to Soulboogiealex in agreeance that it is quite a shame that America hasn't caught on to these guys. I live in Washington State and ran across them about a year and a half ago while linking to the Deltasonic web page via 'The Coral' web page. I listened to a snippit of a song and was really impressed. I was fortunate enough to catch them live in a small, dingy.. but well respected club in Seattle a little over a year ago and was even more impressed with their energy and live performance. I jsut ordered this album and can't wait to hear it first hand!!!"
5,"""shh! behold the majesty of these pointy stone things!""-max",sam and max are the two funnest comic characters to grace the comic books of america. Jonny the homicidal maniac sucks compared to this.buy this book if you want a good laf.(spelled wrong on purpose)
5,"So good, it hurts!","What more can you ask for? Hyperkinetic sight gags, a dog in a fedora with a smart-alec, trigger happy, rabbit sidekick (they drive a DeSoto police car f'pity's sake!), plans on how to make a Walther 9mm Automatic out of 12 bars of soap, supernatural apparitions in a supermarket, a DIY flipbook, and (...wait for it...) THE OFFICIAL RULES TO FIZZBALL!!! This made me laugh so much, my face hurt (the highest compliment I can ever give)! Steve Purcell is a genius! The artwork is just as priceless as the writing. If you've seen the cartoons on Fox Kids Network, you MUST see this material! All the slapstick, and twice the mayhem. Like washing down a handful of NoDoz with a six-pack of Jolt. Your brain will be bouncing around in your skull, and you'll love every second of it.You should...you must...YOU _WILL_ BUY THIS BOOK!!!"
4,Jawbreaker Lite - A great attempt.,"Though the tracks on this CD have been much poo-poo'd by so-called ""fans since the Bivouac days"", I found this album to be a refreshing take on a brilliant theme.Tributes are not meant to duplicate or even approximate the original material. They are meant to incorporate a fan's style and personality on a song they feel touched them in a certain way, such that it inspired them to try to recreate that feeling.If you love Jawbreaker, buy this album. It may give you some perspective regarding how other people view the music of this epic, timeless band.I liked the Kiss The Bottle rendition. So did Blake. I asked him.BTW: Bivuoac wasn't their first album. I've been a fan since the mission district days.(P.S.: Ryan Hood - save your breath, I never was one......)"
3,"great covers, some better than others. All in all I'm happy with it.","Great covers, some better than others. All in all I'm happy with it. Sparta's cover of Kiss the bottle was the piece de resistance. I enjoyed myself, at time I wish I was listening to Jaw Breaker and other times I was content with liberal interpretation of their predecessors."
1,"Bad CD, Everyone's fault","i have been a LONG time jawbreaker fan. not one of these kids that got into them after ""dear you"" had come and gone. i saw jawbreaker on tour supporting the ""Busy"" 7"" the month ""unfun"" came out. anyway, this cd is not very good. these bands try too hard, or is it too easy, to sound and sing like jawbreaker. only 2 or 3 bands give it ""their own"" flavor; ie: duvall, travoltas, face to face. and the track that has been promoted all summer as ""Fifteen"" is not ""Fifteen"", but a track from ""Fifteen"" member Jeff Ott, and it's not that good of a track. anyway, get it simply for novelty.... try to find it used."
2,Basically Monopoly,This is a game that is modeled around monopoly. I requires little to no thought. Two dice determine the out come of where you will landed as you move around the board time after time again. If you like the kind of game you can play with little to no strategy this is the game for you. I wouldn't recommend this game much to anyone. Go buy monopoly and enjoy the original.
5,Nostalgic trip down memory lane.,Mistrustful was a refreshing and comically trip down memory lane. As a proud alumnist of an outstanding Historical Black College or University this book made wonder if the author knew me and my friends and wrote of some of things we experienced as young adults on our own for the first time. The characters were realistic and very believable. I could very easily relate many of the characters to classmates from my freshman year. I thought it was a wonderful first novel and look forward to what is to come from this very talented author.
2,MISTRUSTFUL,"VERY MISTRUSTFUL,NEVER JUGDE A BOOK BY IT'S COVER ,THE COVER MAKES YOU THINK THIS BOOK IS FULL OF SCANDAL.THIS BOOK IS BASICALLY ABOUT A YOUNG COLLEGE STUDENT FOOLING AROUND WITH 3 GIRLS AND WANTS TO HAVE HIS CAKE AND EAT IT TOO.THIS IS PROBABLY A GOOD READER FOR MATURE TEENAGERS.THIS BOOK WAS OKAY ,BUT NOT ALL THAT"
2,The Doggie Day Care Business,"I have done a lot of research for this business and was very disappointed in this expensive DVD. I was hoping the dvd would walk you through some of the logistics and day to day operations of the business. Anyone who has done even a little research would already have this info. Don't waste your money, it gives very little operational information. The money can be better spent on other resources."
4,The Doggie Daycare Business,This video was informative and interesting to anyone thinking of opening their own doggie day care. The interviews were informative and went over many of the things that one may forget or not plan. The visuals of the daycare in action were also very informative. I think this video was very well done
4,Kept my interest,"It was a fast read for me. The reason it is not a 5 star is because I feel that the hero and heroine could have been alittle steamier and there were parts that really needed a bit of a reality check. All in all though, it was a good storyline and I'd probably read it again."
3,A good book for an afternoon read,"I though this book was easy to read and finish in just one afternoon. The story starts when the hero and the heroine are both children (13 or so) and Fox Mercer's father is dishonored and looses his title, his money and his lands because he will not tell who really killed a baron who was a close friend of the kings. The h/h are best friends but are torn from each other only to meet up again 10 years later when she is to be the prize for a tournament and he shows up even though he has now become the outlaw known as the Black Fox. He wins but is thrown in the dungeon but escapes and takes Jordan, the heroine, with him. He tries to keep his anger at her betrayal 10 years before but he finds he still cares for her as she does for him.The characters don't really stand up and impress the reader but the secondary characters are quite amusing.All in all a good book."
3,Good Travelogue,"If you are interested in learning about where to spend your vacation rafting in the Northwest, this is a great video. Introduces the major whitewater rivers and off-water opportunities (side hikes, etc.). If you are looking for rock-um sock-um whitewater kayaking, keep looking - though there is one sequence with of a Dancer trying out a creek. It does remind us that it is not all about the spash. There are other things to see besides the next drop - for some."
1,not very pleased,I have purchased many things on this site and never had a problem until now. The CD that I purchased is a dual set and I only received one CD. I did send an email requesting the other CD and heard absolutely nothing back. I am hesitant on ordering from this site again.
5,Love it!,"I love this soundtrack! We play it for our feild show, and it is the best! The movie is alright, but the music is great."
2,BEWARE - DOES NOT INCLUDE BATTERY CABLES,"The order included the Amptronix multi-stage smart battery charger as well as their desulphator. Both arrived carefully packaged via UPS. But, with total cost including shipping over $240.00, there were no cables of any kind in the box to hook the charger up to a battery and get the show on the road. The charger looks good. No way to tell if it works yet. Bottom line - disappointing lack of awareness of user needs."
3,Harumph.,"All in all, I'd actually say that this was an enjoyable DVD save for one thing - if you're an X comic purist, you'll be vastly disappointed with the deviations from the manga. Certain characters who should've made special reappearances have failed to do so, and certain characters who're still going strong in the comics have received the short end of the stick from the anime director.So now it's three different versions of X. The 'kill everything in sight' movie, the 'let's rush the end and sploot people while we're at it' anime, and the eternally unfinished comic.Oye.If you like action, you'll enjoy this DVD a lot. However, if you're looking for conformity to what's been produced and are expecting it due to the relative following that's been taking place in the last 6 volumes, look no further - here's where it goes right out the window.Still, it's X.Enjoy it while it lasts - only one volume left."
5,One of my favourites!,"If you really like the action end of X, you'll deffinately like these three episodes. So much happens in this DVD and so much action. What's even better is that my four favourite characters (Karen, Yuto, Seiichiro (Mr. Aoki), and Satsuki) are main features in these three episodes. What am I saying? I love all the characters so much. I can't choose favourites! Oh well. Anyway, this is a GREAT DVD, deffinately worth buying if you're into X. Plus the music is just beautiful!"
3,Don McLean Complete Hits,"Not really ""Complete Hits"" - with emphasis on ""Hits"". But some music is included that I hadn't heard before."
5,Very informative production,I found this DVD excellent. As well as being entertained the viewer is taken through the life of Heracles with his adventures and pitfalls along the way. A viewer with no knowledge of the subject could easily follow the material.
4,melvin Riley get my respect,"this was a very good album that was slept on.Melvin has always made good music since his day with ready for the world. It has slow songs on it that wont leave you dissappointed. The best song is whose is it, which he made a video for."
2,Tolerable singing but little else,"In yet another case of a jagged left turn made by a group leader trying to make it on his own, the former lead singer of Ready For The World attempts to reinvent himself as a tougher, more street-wise guy. His singing voice isn't bad by any means, but these songs simply fall flat. Also, it's kind of hard to swallow when the guy who brought us harmless pop confections like ""Oh Sheila"" and ""Tonight"" starts declaring that he's ""The Number One [expletive] From The Hood.""For diehard RTFW fans only."
1,Do not purchase this item,My husband who is an expert at putting things together could not put this chair together straight. The slates on the sides and on the seat did not match the holes.
1,piece of crap!,"i bought this toy 3 mo. ago then saved it for christmas, i've just started putting it togeather and their instructions of how to put it to geather is a picture of most of the epieces (not all) you have no idea where the big polls go or the small i tried it a thousand ways and it never fit right. I finally relized it wont fit togeather AT ALL!!! Its crap DO NOT get this!!!"
1,Terrible Quality,"I never write reviews, but this chair is so bad I felt strongly inclined.The wood is so soft that the slightest bump leads to a dent. Assembly was not an overwhelming process, however, the bad quality shows during assembly, (note- a rubber mallet is strongly recommended to make the pieces fit correctly, however, you will be damaging the chair in the process of assembly because of how cheap of quality that it is).Even after spending enough time trying to ensure proper fitting of the parts, the chair is still skewed once assembled. Also know that it is very easy to strip out the wood when putting the screws in, and without using much torque - again as a testament to how horrible the wood is. I would imagine that use of power tools would result in instant saw dust.Keep searching, this chair is not what you are looking for.After shipping costs, you would be much better off visiting a local store and spending the few extra dollars for a better quality chair."
1,Poor Product,"I ordered this ir for my gransons birthday and the parts didnt fit correctly, one piece had been broken and glued back on it had dents and a gouge around one of the holes to attach one of the rungs. I only paid 14.99 two weeks ago and now they are wanting $39.99! For the quality and what we had to do to fix and assemble this chair this price is outrageous!! Its very soft wood, pine for sure! They need to reapply the $14.99 price for sure not worth a penny over that> Very dissapointed in this chair. Never have I had a bad experience buying from amazon until now. Will be weary of items purchased now."
4,Cute Item,"I purchased this chair for use in my studio. I cant comment on the wear and tear because I havent used it long enough yet. It was a lil odd putting it together but that is because my husband was doing it, It is a nice clean crisp white color. A piece of the paint chipped off where the screw goes in but you wouldnt normally see it if your husband or whoever puts the pole on the correct side of the chair. Great item. Great price.. a lil slow on the shipping."
4,Nice First Outdoor Rocker,"We wanted this for both of our children (1 and 3) to enjoy sitting on the porch with us. The chairs are cute, not terribly difficult to assemble, and have held up to two big and busy kids so far. I'd recommend this rocking chair. It even looks cute in a bedroom, but our children prefer to use it outside."
1,Poor quality,"Very poor quality. Screw holes did not line up, there were gouges and splits in the wood. I had to drill new holes, sand and repaint!!"
3,Not Completely Happy,"I was less than pleased when I received the chair. The instructions were not very clear on assembling. One of the support legs was cracked, but as it was a gift, I did not have time to return. Would probably buy a higher end product next time."
