1,Dirk Pitt taken hostage by ... the author!,"Clive Cussler needs to seriously consider what he is doing to the Dirk Pitt series. this novel is absolutely horrible. the characters talk like a bad spy novel and the action is ludicrously predictable. at one point the bad guy tries to take Dirk out by shooting Dirk down -- and yes, the bad guy flies a Fokker tri-plane to do it! in the heat of battle Dirk actually shouts ""Curse you Red Baron!"" before saving the day (again). we're quoting Snoopy here?! Dirk & Co. actually meet Clive Cussler in the book as Cussler is sailing around the world. we can only hope that next time he takes his computer with him on that voyage and somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic it falls into the ocean? Dirk has gone from an exciting star to a joke and it's the work of his creator. please Mr. Cussler - stop cranking out farces that are practically satires of the thriller genre. free Dirk, Mr. Cussler! let some other author do something good with him!"
5,Patience pays off,"There is something comforting about reading a Clive Cussler 'Dirk Pitt' novel. You know you are going to begin with an incident in the past that will soon come to dominate the action of the present. Cussler's books are like ""Harry Potter""'s for adults -- we anxiously await the latest installment of the classic hero-villain story. As conventional as Cussler might seem to others, to those of us who are devoted Pittophiles, his writing never fails to take us places we could never see, introduce us to people we could never meet, and thrills us with adventures we could never experience. 'Valhalla Rising' is unique on its own, but fits perfectly into the other Cussler books. Read one...you'll be hooked for life."
3,"Not bad, but not as good as previous albums","The first thing I notice on this new Severe Torture album are the Pestilence-like vocals. Production is improved compared to Misanthropic Carnage, however, the album just doesnt feel the same. In fact, it seems like Severe Torture went from a brutal death metal band (ie Devourment, Internal Suffering, Deeds of Flesh), to your standard death metal band (Morbid Angel, Pestilence, etc...). What this means is that they've kinda slowed down and there arent as many blast beats coupled with those deep deep vocals. Bands progress and change or refine their sound, but Id much rather Severe Torture stayed with the same formula as previously used."
4,This album shreds!,"This album is great w/out a doubt! If you like old school death metal w/ a touch of maturity & flawless production, then this album is for you! I've only heard bits & pieces of Severe Torture's other works, but they don't compare to this album especially in it's production & sound. Don't be afraid to give this album a try!"
2,"the first two were decent, this....","is boring. I don't know what the idiot up there is talking about but this is thier worst sounding record to date, I much prefer the sound of ""feasting on blood"". THis album shows the band going stale, vocal wise, guitar wise, etc....especially the vocals, what happened to the sick growls grom the first album? I meen not that the first one or the second one was something unique or special but I dug them....this I don't dig. Newcomers to extreme music or death metal may like this but to all others stay away."
2,,"To describe this record as typical death metal would be an affirmative declaration. Picture Deeds of Flesh with their dual vocal attack playing Morbid Angel riffs and you get an impression of what Severe Torture is. The band does manage to inject some variable life into each song, and while you get the same feeling out of every track, the tempo is mixed between fast blasting songs and explorations into mid-tempo territory. But no matter how you slice it, this is brutal death metal and if that's what you're into you might be pleased with this album. As for me, I'd rather listen to 'Domination' or 'Path of the weakening'."
4,Top Amazon.com editor pick of 2003,"Many thanks to the Amazon.com editors for picking this book as one of their top picks for 2003, otherwise I would not have found it. Monkey Dancing is a charming story of a father and his two pre-teen children as they make their way through forming a new family dynamic, all the while touring some of the world's most endangered plants and animals.The author tells about how he and his family were dealt a double upheaval-the death of his brother from breast cancer and his wife decided that she wanted to leave her marriage and family to start a new one with another women. The writing is clear and flows fluently all the while weaving a tale of vanishing forest, eat exotic foods, and dealing with the forming of a new family."
1,Boring beyond belief,Strictly a travel log! Nothing more! Very difficult to finish! I found myself skimming through quite a bit of the book.
2,Couldn't finish it,"I should have loved this book. I love travel writing, I'm a mom and I would love to do a trip like this with my own son someday. I just could not finish it. I'm amazed that it made Amazon's top 50.I didn't find Glick or his kids very appealing. As I was reading I would think -- this part is supposed to be amusing, but it's not; this part is supposed to be touching, but it's not."
2,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to reading an account of a father travelling with his children and sharing their experiences. Instead, I found this book a diatribe about environmental issues and lacking in humour and interest. I couldn't identify with this man."
1,Unexpectedly disturbing,"This book, written by a drug-using serial college dropout (and occasional journalist) who arranges a far-reaching trip for himself and his two children after his wife leaves him for another woman, disturbed me on several counts: I was uncomfortable with the sleeping arrangements (his young daughter seemed to often share the author's bed), the invasion of privacy (the book includes lengthy excerpts from his children's private journals), and the generally smug tone used to describe some rather odd family rituals.I'm sure the travel experiences were valuable to the participants, but there was way too much unpleasant information about the author and his family to allow me to enjoy this book---frankly, I didn't like them very much at all."
2,Monkey Dancing,I read alot of travelogs and found this one kind of boring. Parts of it was good. But then the author goes on and on about his brother and his ex-wife. Plus the fact that he allowed his 13 yr old son to use drugs and drink alcohol on this trip. I just had a hard time finishing it.
4,Very Helpfull Book,"The Book was very usefull, and easy to follow. It had a very thourough description of all vehicle components."
3,a cool Collection but Missing,this collection has some solid cuts on here but unlike it's Hits Set this is missing the songs that gave the Stylistics there Tradmark.still worth seeking out.there vocals&the arrangements here work really well&this is a set not to overlooked or ignored.
1,Missing In Action,"One of the Stylistics best songs is missing on this compilation.Any guesses?""You Are Everything""A compilation missing that song is blasphemy, especially one named ""Greatest Love Hits""!"
4,Sterling Home 2 pc. Santoku Knife Set,I was very pleased with the knives; seemed well made and nicely packaged. Very good quality for the price.
5,Very Impressive Knife Set,"I purchased this set being unsure about the brand. I had never heard of this brand before, but decided to test it out anyway. I am very impressed. It is a full tang set with a weighted handle. I will buy this kind of knife again. The two knife set makes it very easy to accomplish many everyday cutting tasks. The smaller knife is convenient and easy to use, where the larger knife is sturdy enough to do all that I need."
2,Good reference to a expert awk user who wants to try Gawk,"I bought this book for my computer science course. The author says the quality of the book is bad because he worked hard to maintain the price low. But, personally, I would buy something more visually appealing even if I have to pay 10$ more. Moreover, the author assumes that people know everything about Unix and Gawk, thus for a person like me, it was kinda hard to keep up with the book. However, once you are familiar with the Gawk, this book is kinda good as a reference. If you know Unix and maybe Perl, It can be a good choice. But if you are a JAVAer or C++er and know nothing about Unix.. stick with online tutorial..."
3,Handi-Drink Leaky Drinker,"This is a neat concept in need of a few improvements. It's a portable water bottle that snaps into its own plastic trough so your dog can catch a drink no matter where you are. The bottle is capped with a rubber nozzle with slits in it that are supposed to gradually release the water when the nozzle is snapped upside down into the bowl. That part works great. Unfortunately, when the bottle is full and lying on its side, the slits in the rubber cap leak, and water gets all over the place. The Handi-Drink does come with a carrying strap, so I guess that means you're supposed to transport this bottle vertically. But we hike with our dogs, and I like them to carry their own water in dog backpacks. The leaky bottle is a bummer. This product would be a winner if the manufacturer provided TWO caps - a rubber one with the slits AND a regular plastic one to seal the bottle securely in case it's gonna be carried horizontally."
5,myths and legends,I am of yaqui decent and heard these stories through my father. It was great to read the stories that formed my childhood.
2,Intresting book...but nothing special,This book is about a man who is found to be guilty of murdering an arab in Algeria during the French colonization of Algiers. I found the main character to be boring and emotionless. It is aggravating how cold he is. I reaaly wouldn't recommend this book if your just reading it for fun / entertainment.
3,Subject matter not appropriate for the 4-8 age group,"This book is well written and beautifully illustraded, but the subject matter is a little heavy for the 4-8 age group. My husband and son brought this home from the library when he was four. My son was already reading at this level and the title was very misleading. I previewed the book and took it right back to the library. My son is now 9 and only now do I think the subject matter could be appropriatly explained to him in a manner he could comprehend. Some very mature children could maybe read this at 8, but not without parental guidance to give them a historical perspective. This book tells a valuable story, but I believe its mature subject matter is aimed at the wrong age group."
2,UHH.. bsb is so much BETTER!!!,aRE THEY EVEN ALLOWED TO DO THIS.. ITS INSULTING TO ME CAUSE THESE GUYS (...) AND SOUND NOTTTHING LIKE BSB... MAN IT HURTS MY EARS!! NO TRU BSB FAN WOULD SUPPORT THIS.. UNLESS UR CRAZY
1,"I'm a good person, what did I do to deserve this?!","The only thing I can say about this CD is OH MY MERCEFUL LORD! (and not in the good way) I seen it in the store the other day and since I love Backstreet Boys, I was gonna buy it, but then I thought, ""hey, what if it's not even them, and if it's not, who is it?"" then I just heard a sample and I have to totally agree with my other fellow fans that did reviews, it made me wanna slap whoever did this to the world, I just hope that the real Boys had nothing to do with this, because even if I still love them, they might not recover for a while."
1,Oh my god,"Oh my god. I really dunno what else to say. I am absolutely speechless. I cannot believe that this thing actually exists. The fact that it does is just a testament to the absolute stupidity and credulity of a good portion of the population. A TRIBUTE to the BACKSTREET BOYS??? All I can think to say is Oh My God. Why, God, WHY?? Another good question: why the hell is the lowest possible rating you can give a whole star?"
3,well................... it's ok i guess,"ok, if u are like a super big Backstreet fan then i guess that it is an ok album to buy but the people singing the songs don't sound ne thing like the BSB so like if u have there cd's i really don't think that u should buy it. I listened to samples and i decided that i would rather just buy a cd with the real Backstreet Boys on it. But by the way to those people who had nothing but bad stuff to say bout the Backstreet Boys, I think that that was really rude to say bout them. I might not like this CD, but i still luv the Backstreet Boys and don't like people who trash them"
1,This is really bad!,"This was painfully bad. I can't come up with any other word other than bad. It was just bad. Sooo bad. There are two reasons why I gave it one star...1.It is a tribute to the Backstreet Boys and that at least deserves something, no matter how lame the final product is, and 2.This site would not allow anything less than one star."
1,EEK!,"Dude, I am the hugest bsb fan and there is NO WAY that this cd is worth anyone's time! It's terrible, I'm sorry. Why even bother buying a cd with fake backstreet boys on it when you could get the real thing, with vocals that actually sound halfways decent?? JEEZ it's almost a crime to waste your time on this. Maybe I'm being a little harsh, but I doubt it."
1,What a Joke!,"I bought this CD under the impression that it was remixes or something. When I listened to it, I had to start laughing!! I mean, it is being sung by someone who obviosly likes the BSB, but should stick to simply being a fan. Personally, I thought that it was a complete waste of my money. Please don't waste your money on it unless you are looking for a comedy CD."
1,I can't believe this..,"This has to be the worst thing I have ever heard! Whoever is singing on here could never equal the talent of the guys..not in this lifetime! Listen to the 'tribute' version of 'Everybody' and 'I Want It That Way' and you will automatically wonder what in the world these people are thinking, I know I was. This is not worth buying, I'm a big fan, but there's no way I would waste my money on this when I can buy the real thing! (Chapter One would be a better investment! Or anything else by the guys) I think they made the cover look like that so they could convince BSB fans to buy it, thinking it was the real BSB and it's not."
1,Good idea ... but ...,"It was a good idea to pay a tribute to the Backstreet Boys - I like their work and they do deserve a tribute, but like Puppyluv93 said, it's not worth spending your money on this CD. I did listen to the samples and, although it's kinda good, it's not worth the Backstreet Boys. I don't know, maybe it's just a matter of vocal standards."
1,"""Tribute"" Not One","I cannot in good conscience recommend this disk. I wasn't sure what to expect and am still at a loss after listening to it. It put me in mind of a bad lounge act in the Catskills ala ""Saturday Night Live"" and Bill Murray. (Is this what 'the Boys' have to look forward to?) If I could've given it less than one star I would have."
3,Go Backstreet,"Once again they are being executed just for doing what they love, which is making music for millions of people. I believe that everyone has their own opinions and I will never bash anyone for their musical taste and I expect the same respect from all of you too. The Backstreet Boys have fought long and hard to get where they are today and they deserve a tribute album. Just the fact that this cd exists proves that someone thinks they're worthy. The BSB would be the first ones to come forward and say ""this didn't have to be done for us"". If you are a true fan and a collector of BSB ""stuff"" like I am then this is just another spot on the shelf filled. Thank you."
4,Tranquility in a C.D.,"I just listened to the c.d. and it was tranquility in a c.d., the music felt like a spiritual journey to all parts of the world, instead I was in my living room. I would recommend this to anyone who would want to get a peace of mind and listen to music ahead of this time.....this c.d. would be the to get..."
4,Wonderful Book,"This is the second book in the Dragonback series. I find these books very interesting - great for adults as well as children. The story is gripping and exciting. The premise of a two-dimensional alien who can become three-dimensional is very good. I enjoy reading the situatuions that Jack and Drayco get into, and the unusual way they get out of them. A great series for all."
5,Fado with a lilt,"Lush and lovely, Teresa Salguiero's voice floats over the guitars and tasteful synthesizer of her comrades. Many of the lyrics are just as lovely. A more elegant undertaking than earlier works."
5,Nice for the price,Nice jacket. So far I've used it in temps in the lower 40's . Could be better with some pockets inside the coat as well as one outside in the chest area.
3,Mostly good,"Great coat for the price. However, zipper did mess up first time worn and jacket runs short. Ordered XL for my son who is between a L and XL. Jacket barely hits the top of his pants when he's standing, not a good coat when he sits or bends over. Otherwise, good coat for price."
2,Zipper is junk....,"Cheap zipper on otherwise good coat. I used this jacket hunting and twice the zipper 'popped' open in the middle. It's a plastic zipper, not metal. Oh, and didn't like the pockets. They were lined with 'nit' fabric that picks at dry skin etc.....not a soft or deep pocket."
4,great mid-weight jacket,I got this jacket for my husband and it was a great buy. A good sturdy jacket for a good price.
4,good joint effort: Brazilian and jazz music,"I was shocked to read the review by ""someone"" from Toronto. I am pretty sure he does not understand either jazz or Brazilian music. Blanchard does a good enough job with the music of Ivan Lins, and I can hear this CD over and over. Please do not pay attention to the review I am refering to, BUT TO THE MUSIC in the CD, you will enjoy it very much.Other efforts by Blanchard are very good, but I prefer him working is small groups (quartets, quintets). He is an excellent performer, composer, and arranger, however, under the shadow of fellow trumpeter from New Orleans,Wynton Marsalis."
4,Deserves Reissue!,"This recording is a splendid example of the concept of synergy, i.e., when two or more entities work together to produce something of more value or effectiveness than the simple sum of their individual contributions. Trumpeter Terence Blanchard combines with Brazilian singer/songwriter Ivan Lins to produce a recording that is far better than anything I have ever heard from either one of these artists. Who'da thunk it? Lins's voice can become grating, but here it is used to complement Blanchard's trumpet, and it works perfectly. Blanchard is a fine player, but never really inspiring--but working with Lins seems to have inspired him to the point that his trumpet truly speaks from the heart. The other musicians on this recording also contribute with heartfelt musicianship, the net result being the perfect CD for a romantic evening."
1,"right material, wrong artist","I am a fan of Brazilian music of all kinds, and a sometimes jazz fan. I have read about Terence Blanchard's work but, until this CD, had not heard him. Ivan Lins gives Blanchard marvelous songs to play but Blanchard does virtually nothing of interest with them. In fact, the playing is mind-numbingly, teeth-achingly dull. Too often on the slower material, Blanchard holds notes for what seems like forever because he has no other place he wants to go. Technically proficient, but boring, the CD feels like it lasts for hours. Lins tries adding vocal accompaniment to most tunes, but that usually doesn't work, because again Blanchard shows no understanding of the material that he is working with. Any of Lins own albums is better than this by a wide, wide margin. As for Blanchard, I don't know him well enough to hazard a guess, but I sure don't plan to give him another listen for a long, long time."
5,dog brush,Perfect for our little fluff ball. It is probably one of the best brushes for Cotons and other dogs with flluffy soft hair
4,Great Product,It's a good slicker and comfortable to use. It worked well with my Lagotto's puppy coat but now as it has thickened and curled I've had to use a bent pin slicker to be able to get through the coat. I'd definitely only recommend it for a soft thinner coated breed.
4,"Very good brush, a bit big for our cat.","First, let me say the product is a 5-star product. I am using it NOT as intended on dogs, but rather on cats.This dog brush is the only one which had the short metal bristles. It works well on our long haired cats. I wish there was a smaller version with the same bristles for our short haired cats. (hint hint to manufacturer and retailer)"
3,NICE STOCKINGS,"REALLY LIKE THESE STOCKINGS, THE SEXY RHINESTONES UP THE BACK OF THE LEG ARE A REAL EYE CATCHER.MY HUSBAND ENJOYED LOOKING AT THEM VERY MUCH..."
1,Rhinestones Snag!,These are the cheapest thigh highs I've ever purchased. They got snagged as I was simply and gently removing them from their package. The material is not soft...it's actually a bit itchy. Would not purchase these again. The rhinestones are sparse and would more than likely fall off if I were to hand wash them. Bottom line: going in my trash. BIG disappointment!!
4,"Enjoyable read, important lesson, recommended","This is a short children's story about how God is with us any time we call upon Him. Some of the writing comes directly from the Psalms (i.e. Make my heart your own) and can be a good way to introduce children to the Bible by locating the same passage.The authors emphasizes continuously throughout the book that God cares about all the details of our life including the most minor things you do and say each day. Written predominantly as a prayer it helps teach children the importance of prayer and how to pray. Dear God, It's Me is a recommended children's book."
5,Amazing,"My kids absolutely love this book. They like to take turns ""reading"" it with the cd. Beautiful music, illustrations, and message. I love that the music continues for a while after the story is read. Perfect when you want to mellow the kids down."
3,Easy to squeeze but has flaws,"This product grinds salt and pepper with very little effort. The grip is comfortable, so it's very easy on your hands.Caveats: It works best when full (otherwise the peppercorns just jump around since there's nothing pressing them down toward the grinding mechanism). I found refilling this a bit bit taxing--expect to make a mess. The opening is small and awkwardly placed."
2,"Nice idea, but unreliable.","The dual grinder is a great idea, and worked well initially. However, the salt portion ceased working only months after purchase leaving this gadget to be only a pepper grinder. Then, after only modest use, the plastic handle snapped off."
3,Disapointed,"I am disapointed. This looked a lot better than the traditional grinder's, so I thought I would try it. It takes too long to grind and not very much comes out at a time. I do like the easy loading doors."
2,I bought the mini verson,"My wife an I saw this unit in a specialty store, thought is was pretty neat. Then we purchased it on Amazon. We like it for a number of reasons, it has a magnet that was handy for storing it on the bottom of our microwave oven, in reach for that quick launch of ground pepper. However, we hadn't used it more than maybe 10 times and the handle broke off! Now it is kaput! Can't fix it, etc. Piss poor quality control, but a nice idea!"
3,"Good, not great.",This is an awesome ergonomically-designed grinder. Mine had light duty for two years before the handle broke. I'm buying another one because of the convenience; too bad the handles don't last ... things nowadays are engineered for wearing out to ensure manufacturers stay in business.
4,Great everyday use,"I like this grinder very much. It grinds the salt very well, but the pepper takes a while. Sometimes I have to shake it to get the peppercorns into the grinder and then it works better. For recipes etc., it's not so great having to pump your hand a hundred times. For just regular use, dinner, etc, it's wonderful."
2,I wasn't happy with the quality,"I didn't buy this for myself, it was a gift. Honestly I doubt I would have purchased it for myself because I wanted a *serious* pepper grinder. I use my grinder every day and I like a lot of pepper. I found this grinder to be a pain because of how light the output was-- I had to sit there squeezing for what felt like ages. In addition, the grind isn't adjustable, although it was supposed to be. Finally, the handle simply broke off one day. I didn't drop it or anything. I guess it's not for serious use."
3,Stiff turning,"I fell in love with this dual grinder at a cousin's house in North Carolina and researched and found it on Amazon. It is stiff turning between salt/pepper, so isn't really suitable for daily use."
2,Cheap,"Very cheaply made, feels like it might last a few months. Leaks out where you sit it. Would not buy this again."
4,Great dual grinder,"I bought this dual grinder to replace an old dual s/p grinder that I had had for years and that finally broke. I went through about 4 other dual grinders (some very expensive) before I finally found this one. Yes, it does have its limitations (coarseness of grind), but it works like a charm...especially for the price!"
1,Piece of trash,"Worked a week and then the peppercorns jilted the shaft and now I only have a salt grinderWaste of money for poor craftsmanship. And no help at all from the company other than try another one, but we will not only not replace, but not issue any credit.Buy at your own risk, or just use a hammer.Still looking for a simple easy durable mill."
3,Meh,"Not my favorite grinder. I bought this one because it has both salt and pepper in one. I love how one can twist the top grip part around to get the other seasoning. However, I have a picky boy in the house that will not eat anything with pepper on it, so when I would grind the salt, pepper would slip out a lot, so I had to buy separate grinders. When grinding the pepper, I have to shake it sometimes because the pepper doesn't go down to the grinder. Once the salt and pepper are gone out of this grinder, I'll prbably put it up and not use it again."
4,Very fun clock,"The base of the glass acts as a pendulum, which I was very excited to see. Due to its interesting angles, it is a bit hard to measure, but its about 9in. at its widest point by 12in long. The clock workings are about 1.5 in deep. I will admit that I was expecting a more rigid clock face, but its still very cute, and most importantly, operable."
5,1 year old+ son loves this,"My son got this for his first birthday from grandma and grampa and it's easily his fave toy. The whizzes and lights, the sounds, plus he can ride on it. He can hang out on the floor with this for an hour...crazy. What would we have done without it???"
1,Disappointed - not suitable for age range,I bought this for my nephew for his 1st birthday. He loved it - that is until he kept getting pinched by the wings and 'owwies' from the propellers. It tipped over a lot too - in the end it was easier to throw it out than to deal with the injuries it caused! He had it less than 2 months - what a waste of money. Wouldn't recommend at all.
3,Not Enough Pictures,"It's a good book, which offers some very good tips, but there are not enough pictures of the food. It has some nice recipes, which I may try as well as tips on purchasing items, in terms of selecting the quality in which to purchase. The lack of pictures of how the food should look was a big disappointment for me."
1,Unhappy with book,"This book was not as good as I expected. Based on previous reviews, I thought it was going to be outstanding. There really is only one, maybe two recipes that I want to try. The others sound too fancy (and I am a pretty experienced cook) or just not interesting. My fiance eats everything and after he looked through the book, he said a lot of the recipes didnt sound very good. Overall, a waste of my money and quite disappointed."
3,Overly Ambitious,"In this somewhat allegorical novel of early 19th century Latin American history, Fuentes attempts to produce a hybrid historical and philosophical novel. The protagonist is a young Argentine revolutionary and romantic whose travels take him throughout Latin America during the revolts from Spain. The allegory is the protagonist's pursuit of a woman whom he glimpsed only briefly and whom he has wronged. The result is not really successful, partly because characters and narrative seem to switch from one mode to another without good integration of the philosophical and historical elements Fuentes is attempting to combine. Oddly, the book suffers from being too short. It would have been much better to incorporate the philosophical elements into a longer and more naturalistic historical novel, a la Tolstoy's War and Peace. This book also contains some magical realist elements, which seem engrafted into the novel and consequently incongruous. Interesting but not very rewarding reading."
5,Six-Legged Apocalypse Now,"Yo straight-up, this is the greatest bugumentary ever made! There are all kinds of crazy camera angles inside this teeming megalopolis of seething insecticism, and at its horripilated core the heaving mass of the queen daily pumps out 30 000 drone-clones to feed the maw of evolution's fangs and claws. Weird purplish lights glint and glimmer inside the queen's body as the war drums that are the abdomens of weaver ants beat against quaking leaves and finally summon ant armageddon. A terrific battle ensues under lightning and rain, and the resultant walls of mud finally carry the dying, damned, and doomed down into the dark recesses of a dirt-and-spit labyrinth. John Cusack's narration is pitch perfect over top of the deathmatch, neither under- nor overstated as the micro is translated into the macro."
5,Very entertaining,"The macro photography of the termites, ants, and a few other insects is stunning. I found the action of the insects fighting to be more dramatic than most of the action films I've seen recently. If you are looking for a very entertaining movie about insects, here it is."
5,The Stylistics,"Which one of The Beatles, who are heralded as the world's greatest talented group, has a voice which even comes close to The Stylistics lead singer Russell Thompkins Jr's beautiful, soulful, flawless voice? As a matter of fact, try to think of anyone who sings like this guy! The Stylistics are for real. Buy it."
4,The Best of the Sylistics,Its what I expected. What can I say? Its a CD with the songs on it that were listed and sung by the Stylistics.
2,Don't cut songs short!,"I bought this CD several years ago, and I knew something didn't sound right. My hunch was confirmed when a couple of months ago I discovered that this album's version of ""People Make the World Go Round"" was the 45-rpm version, not the six-plus minute track found on ""The Original Debut Album"", the version I often heard in the evenings on soul stations. Although the latter half of the LP version is all instrumental, it highlights the lush orchestration found in those 1970's Philly Sound tracks. The problem with most ""Best of"" albums is that they cater to the casual listener, not a true fan. Especially the case w/old school soul. Spend the extra money and buy the full-length versions of the individual songs as singles, or the original album. No need to buy the short versions anymore!"
4,Smooth.... Very Smooth,"This album is worth every penny.I enjoy listening to ""I'm stone in love with you."" and ""You are everything."" ""You make me feel brand new."" would be better if Airrion Love had a more soulful voice.(Airrion Love is the dull sounding baritone who kicks off the song.)His voice sounded dull,sleepy,and dragging.""You're a big girl now"" would sound much better if the drummer didn't try to show off so much.(It sounded like a three-yearold kid messing up but trying to play it off smoothly.)And Russell Thompkins,Jr(That's the name of the lead singer)sounded as if he were trying to imitate Eddie Kendricks.His voice was cracking on high notes and it didn't sound so smooth compared to the other songs.The other songs are excellent.Thompkins really added emotion on the last couple minutes of ""Heavy fallin out"" He was screaming out anger and frustration and the song tells the truth."
4,Muy bueno,"les digo que el disco vale la pena por la calidad de la grabacion digital. Me trae gratos recuerdos de mi epoca estudiantil y de mis novias de la epoca, ya que sus canciones son muy romanticas."
4,It takes me back--and that's a good thing!,"The only reason I bought this CD was one song that WAS my childhood: Track 3 ""Rockin' Roll Baby."" I notice other reviewers raving about Tracks 1, 2 and 6, but come on, 3 is a classic.Just listening to this song made me want to open my arms wide and sing my head off. That feeling you get watching Julie Andrews build to a crescendo on the top of a mountain in ""The Sound of Music."" When it gets to the part, ""He was BORN in a theater, in Bloomfield, West Virginia..."" I am standing on the car seat, head out the window shouting along at the top of my lungs. That song just lifts my spirits so effortlessly.The Stylistics give me that vibe with every song they sing like a perfectly smooth velvety 50s standards band, with standard classic pop.I was back in Fort Shafter playing kickball with my buddies as the sun set over the hills, our parents prepping the barbecues. Aaah. Think I'll go turn on the CD now..."
5,Simply The Best!,The Magnum salt & pepper grinders surpass any brand I have tried. Their output per turn is incredible and the quality of both products is excellent.
2,Unicorn Great & Not too good,"I LOVE the pepper mill and thought the salt mill would as good. I was completely disappointed! Worked OK for a day or two but then the nylon grinder does not hold up to sea salt crystals. I know salt eats steel but they could use stainless steel and have two GREAT products, not just one."
1,does not work,"I don't know if the mill I bought is defective or if it simply doesn't work, but the salt comes out at such a tryingly slow rate that I've stopped using it. Turning the grind adjust doesn't change the situation. Seeing as how it costs a great deal of money I was expecting the Rolls Royce of salt grinders, but this is not even a bike with training wheels. On the other hand, I also have the companion pepper mill which works to a tee."
4,Good compilation with a couple of new songs,"I got this CD when it came out in 1995. Two songs were recorded just for this CD. They are John Mellencamp's Teddi's Song and Aretha's Joy to the World. U2's New Year's Day is on here too, and you don't hear them on a lot of Christmas CDs. Wynton Marsalis does a nice instrumental of Let it Snow and Aaron Neville's Bells of St. Mary's is good also.There are some familiar tunes. Bruce's Santa Claus is Coming To Town, The Eagles' Come Home For Christmas and Elton's Step Into Christmas are all holiday standards. I have this CD in my house somewhere. I'm going to find it and play this. It's been a while since I heard it, but I remember it. This CD may be hard to find, but if you see it, buy it."
5,Review of Condominiun Concepts by Peter Dunbar,"This book is a must read for those living in Florida communties under the Florida Statue 718 (""The Condominium Act"")including homeowners, directors and sales staff. It is very informative, easy to read, and utilizing the index and content pages, you are able to locate a desired subject quickly."
5,"Excellent, but avoid condos at all cost.","Excellent book, but NEVER live in a self-governed 55+ condo. You've been warned. Book itself however, is fantastic. Just wish I'd known about the book, and read it before I moved into a self-governed condo association here in Florida. Pitiful, incompetent, uneducated and hypocritical Board Member owners that form cliques and alienate condo owners. Board meetings are truly a bunch of old grumpy people swearing and arguing while accomplishing nothing."
2,Wrong information in this book,"When you are limited on time the last thing you want to do iswaste it going to places in which have changed thier hours anddays they are open. Some stores had moved. It should have only been a 2001 guide not 2002! There were to many errors! They might have been related to 9-11 as far as the hours changingHowever, it is not fun to waste precious time."
4,Great case,"This case is very nice and the magnet makes opening and closing the case easy. The only problem that I have is removing the phone from the case quickly. Still, it's a nice product. The magnet is a great feature!"
1,Oh so disappointing,"I had expected this book to be a thriller offering a fascinating look at the NY fashion scene, with lots of insider knowledge and an outlet for Ms. Klensch's opinions regarding style, beauty, etc. I had always enjoyed her work on CNN and was looking forward to this novel. Sadly, if I hadn't been spending the weekend at an isolated cabin with nothing else to read, I wouldn't have finished this book. I didn't learn anything about the fashion industry. Weak plot, cardboard cut-out characters, an unsympathetic heroine."
1,Live? Dead? Don't Bother with this Book (or author?),"Every seam between every sentence in this book shows. They are grammatically correct, but that's about it. The plot line is interesting but the book is so badly written, analysis of it helps suggests what good novel writing might be about.For example of excellent early efforts, see Laurell Hamilton's ""Guilty Pleasures"" or Brian Haig's ""Secret Sanction"". Hamilton writes fantasy/horror/gore (ordinarily I loath that stuff), while Haig writes thrillers, so they may not appeal to fashionistas.Haig really improves his series, especially given he deals, even peripherally, with larger political issues. Gotta love his wise-cracking alter ego, Sean Drummond, ""The meal was an Army MRE -- Meal, Ready-to-Eat -- proof that the army has a sense of humor, despite what you hear. One bite, and I remembered what I don't miss about being a field soldier."" (from ""Man in the Middle)"
1,I would recommend this book for ........,.........pre teen or early teen girls. It's too boring and poorly written for adult reading.
3,an OK Product.,It just an Ok Product.If you leave the remote plugged in the wire the battery Might Overheat!! Seriously! it overheat.Just plug the remote couple of hours while you're playing otherwise theres no need to leave it plug. the battery turns in to a hand-toast.
5,Must Have,I run through batteries like crazy without one of these. It is cheapest on amazon. I like this one the best because you can charge and play at the same time.
5,Excellent!,This was one of my best purchases for the 360 to date. You will save SO much $$ on batteries by using the play and charge kit..
5,Awesome,It works awesome and allows me to play without needing to worry about my batteries dying in the middle of a match!
5,Working perfectly and still looks new after a year.,I bought this for my husband over a year ago. It is a great quality item and still looks as though it were new. We havem't had any problems with it. It's a fraction the cost of others in the stores. Great buy!~
4,Necessary,"Necessary. Not great, not bad. Advice: Only use them when you're battery is low and your xbox is on. Do not leave them plugged to your controller after it the xbox is off. Using frequently will shorten your battery life. Letting your battery completely die will also shorten the life. SO use accordingly."
4,Good compromise,"This device charges the included battery slowly and requires the controller to be attached to the xbox while charging--which remains on to charge the battery even if you tell your xbox to turn itself off. It also uses the same usb port that the wireless adapter does, so if you have a wireless adapter, be prepared for aggravations.Why then do I give it 4 stars? Very simple: it comes with a battery and only costs a few dollars more than a battery by itself. That being the case, it is a good compromise if one is not willing to pay for the xbox 360 quick charge kit. Alternatively, you could simply get AA rechargeable batteries and a battery charger and opt out of the proprietary mess all together."
1,Very Bad Quality,I bought two of these and within a year one of the batteries would no longer hold a charge and would need to continuously be plugged in and the cord for one developed a loose connection. The cord would have to be wrapped around the joystick just to charge. We managed another year or so. During this period the other batter went kaput and both cables just completely stopped working.I'm definitely going to try a different brand of battery and charging system.
2,Not meant for PC,"This is a fantastic system when you need to replace your battery in the wireless controller! Plus the fact you can charge and play at the same time is pretty much perfect...however, the USB plugin only charges the battery. I bought this thinking it would work for my computer, but it wasn't entirely apparent on the package. I suppose I could have done my research ahead of time, but why not add in the feature where it can communicate as a joypad with my computer too?I'll end up having to buy wired controllers instead of using this, but its still a nice battery unit."
1,Horrible,Have own two Play and Charge Kits and both have stop working. The batteries can die in under an hour at this point and sometimes do not even charge at all
2,It Doesn't Charge Anymore,"I bought this charge kit so I can avoid buying batteries for my Xbox controller. It worked fine in the beginning, but now it doesn't seem to hold a charge anymore. I don't what why. The only way that I can use it is if I keep it connected (wired) to my Xbox. The cord is pretty long. Oh well, I guess it's better than nothing."
5,Works great,"It seemed to take quite a while to charge the controller pack the first time. However, it doesn't keep you from playing since you can play while it is charging.I did find that charging on the XBOX while it is turned off is a little quirky. I plugged it in while the XBOX was on, and then turned it off. After a while, though, the USB port seemed to turn off its power and the controller quit charging.That was not a particular problem for me, though, as I have powered USB ports on both my cable set top box and the Wii. I have since been charging it via the cable box. Works great.The only real problem, though, is that it was $7 more than a white one, which doesn't make sense at all."
4,"Works well, but is a bit slow","I don't use this to play the games. My controllers are wireless, and I use this just to recharge the battery pack when I'm not playing. Positives: It does what it's supposed to, which is charge. But I don't know how well it works in terms of having it connected while playing, as a wired controller, because I don't use it for that. Good thing is if you start charging and turn off your xbox, it will still keep charging. Negatives: Takes a while to charge."
2,Was fun while it lasted...,"I've four of these sets since owning my 360, and after several months 3 of the 4 no longer hold a charge. Google this problem and you'll find plenty of other people in the same boat.My advice is to buy some Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable batteries. They're one of the top brands, last long, and best of all you can use them for more than just your xbox controllers."
2,Battery Life,Battery Charge does not hold 25 hours in my XBOX Elite controller. More like 8 hours of continuous play. Great for convenience/multiplayer games.
1,XBOX 360 play and charge kit,"I bought this in January. My son may have used it 3 times. If I would have known it was a piece of garbage, I would have just gone to WalMart and gotten a new one for like $6 more. I am soooooooooooooooooooooooo disappointed in this!"
1,Charge Kit,"I bought this kit for my son for christmas. He says his battery does not stay charge and the kit don't work...Unfortunately, I don't have the package or receipt that came w/it. So now I gotta buy a new for my son..."
1,product did not work,"Bought it used and it did not work. I have one already, but wanted another for my other controller. The one I have works just fine, so I know it is not the controller."
2,Great for a few months...,"I myself love rechargable items. It's a lot more convenient that scrambling for batteries all the time. Unfortunately, like most rechargable items, this battery pack begins to die after a couple months. While it was still charging and playable, the juice went out in about a quarter of the time that the normal batteries do, which is pretty pitiful. If you are desperatle for a rechargable controller, get the pack, but buyer beware..."
2,Died in 5 months. Called for warranty (which is 90 days) they told me to buy a new one,I mean really only 5 months??? I didnt even use it as much as I wanted to. Cant believe the warranty is ONLY 3 Months. Microsoft does not believe their product will last more than 90 Days. Why should you
1,A COMPLETE waste of money.,"I'll try to keep this short-My play and charge kit is not even a year old, it's around 8 months. It will not hold a charge anymore. You can plug it in to have it say it's charging, let the light turn green (which means it's fully charged), then you unplug the chord and the controller dies instantaneously.I don't recommend this product to anyone.It's more inconvenient but you're much better off with rechargeable AA batteries, they'll at least last you for more than a few months. Before I bought the play and charge kit I used those for about 5 years, the only problem that would occur is if the controller would die mid-game. Still better than flushing your money down the toilet though."
5,A must have,This fit our xbox wireless controller and we have had no problems with it so far in the last few months. We were going through batteries like crazy as he would watch movies on his xbox and the controller would not turn off. Worth every dollar buying this!!
1,Charge my @$$!!,"I have an Xbox 360 black wireless controller that I use to play games for windows on my laptop. This thing absolutely will not work as a charger. I wound up getting two of them. One came with a debunked battery that doesn't work. Neither of them will light up the red charge led on the controller. I have been able to play with one of them plugged in, but that kind of defeats the purpose of buying a wireless controller.Before you ask, yes I do have the Microsoft wireless receiver for windows, and my controler and batery do work with my friends play and charge kit."
1,Overpriced,"I can get many more AA rechargeable NiMH batteries of higher capacity for the price of this pack (I love the hybrid type). Unlike this pack, they can be used in other equipment too. I charge them seperately in a wall charger, and when the low battery warning comes on, it takes a few seconds to pop the old ones out, and swap them with a fully charged pair."
1,A major waste of money,"This product is great, if you enjoy spending money on a product that will only work for 3 months if that.The product works fine at first, then you start to notice the battery going dead sooner and sooner until it no longer holds any charge.This typically happens in 3 - 4 months, whether you get the black or grey versions of the charge and play kit.Waste of money if you ask me. Only buy if you want to buy a new one in 3 months."
4,Plug and play,"Not much i can say about this. it does exactly like it says. Its nice not having to continuously change my batteries. However, this doesnt last as long as AA's. The plug keeps this problem from interfering with my game time."
1,dont waste your money,I honestly was not really that impressed with this. It will only charge your battery if you actually have the xbox on. Go with the quick charger instead and keep your controller wireless.
3,Not new,"This was a great deal, however; when going through the Amazon toolbar to find what I'm looking for New was one of the catagories selected, new is what the product specified, but what I received was the pack, charger, and instructions in a plastic bag. Product appeared to be used."
3,Didn't use it to its full potential,"I had a problem with my RF board so I thought this would fix it. It didn't. So for those of you have a messed of RF board don't bother wasting money on this.I'm voting it a 3, I didn't really use the product so I don't want to be unfair with it. I just used it to see if it would fix my RF board problem and it didn't, I sold it back to a friend then made the money back though :)"
1,Broke My Xbox.,"The Xbox 360 Black Play and Charge Kit Broke My Xbox. The problem is its not a ""break away"" cord. So if you pull a little to much your xbox comes topling down and you know the build quality on the xbox sucks. So dont buy unless your planing on sitting three feet from your tv."
2,It didnt worked since I get it,"The charger doesnt charges,the controller works but when I unplugged it it stops working. MAybe its the battery...."
1,No quality control at Microsoft,"I have purchased 2 of these play and charge kits this year - one from this vendor and one from Best Buy. Great idea. Within 2 months, each kit has failed. The batteries appear to be fine, but the cable is of poor quality and fails to charge."
1,Half Working,"I received this product and only half of it worked. For some reason the cable would not work and would actually just drain the battery's instead of charge them, the battery however did work but the cable is what i really needed."
2,Good for charging BUT won't hold a charge,"I bought this product about a month ago almost and wanted to wait to write a review since defects inproducts like this usually arise a couple weeks/months later. Well, I do like the fact that I don't have to buy AA batteries all the time so that's good news. On the other hand, the battery doesn't hold a charge...and it's only getting worse. After 1 week of use I had to recharge it every day with minimal use. After the second week it was already having to be plugged in during an hour or two of fame play because the flashing lights annoy. Now, the 4 bars drop down to 1 bar of battery life after 30 minutes or less of use. I have a feeling that soon I am going to have to constantly have the USB wire plugged in at all times...so it's not going to be wireless at all. I guess I will have to buy a new battery. Not recommended, buy just the USB alone then buy another Microsoft battery"
1,Terrible product,"I bought two of these chargers from Microsoft. The first one was dead right out of the box, not even trying to charge. The second one died within a week-- if I unplug the controller from the charging cable, the controller dies in less than five minutes, even if left to charge for hours. I've learned my lesson and will not be trying a third time. This cheaply-made product is not worth the money."
3,"Good Battery, Faulty Cord","The battery works great and it goes for hours and hours after it's charged. The cable on the other hand tends to have faulty connection. You usually have to charge when your not using your Xbox because it often will disconnect and stop charging. It become very frustrating during a good action game. If you do have it though, try charging when you go to bed so it can charge in an unchanging environment."
1,Don't order from Bluemall,"I received a fake/knockoff item even though the official Microsoft item was shown and described.I already have one official Microsoft play and charge kit, but I needed one for an additional controller. I ordered the item sold from Bluemall(through Amazon's product page) for $9.99, and I received a cheap Chinese knockoff. I cannot measure the battery's capacity, but it is less than half of the weight of the official Microsoft battery.I guess finding one of these brand new for under ten dollars really is too good to be true."
3,It works...sometimes!,"Ok, let me start by saying this. IF the charger works with your controller then this is great to have BUT (seriously, there has to be a but to this because it's Microsoft) the Play and Charge kit doesn't work with all 360 controllers! I have no idea why but the black controller that came with my Elite didn't work at all with the Play and Charge kit. The charge light will turn red for about 30 seconds then turn green indicating a fully charged battery when in fact its not charged at all. Luckily, I had a buddy who's black controller he bought separate DID work and so traded me controllers. Problem solved...I guess."
1,Will not work,"I cannot get the thing to hold a charge at all. I have left this plugged into the xbox forever and as soon as I unplug it, the controller dies. I give up and will continue to just use real batteries."
4,everything it says in the caption,"this product actually showed up w/in a week. Right out of the box ready to go. The only problem ive found w/ it is the charger. The end that receives the power is a usb connection, so that wasnt very handy. i did solve the problem by using my iphone 120v-usb power adapter and was able to charge it by my favorite chair. The battery stays charged for a very reasonable amount of time. Buy it"
3,long cable but.....,"is a great long cable but the battery dies quickly, wish the battery was a bit better, wish i can get my money back."
2,cheap at best,"For one, my order came about a week or more late, and they offered to give me 3 dollars in return. big whoop. But these things came and only 1 fit right, the other didnt even fit in the controller and latch. I charged it before playing with them installed and they might last for about 2 hrs then you need to recharge again. Save your money and buy an authentic Microsoft rechargeable battery and charger or a better off brand. these suck, plain and simple."
4,Volatile sometimes,"For the most part, this play and charge kit is very good. The battery lasts quite sometime and charging it is really simple. The only downside is that sometimes the controller randomly disconnects when I'm playing even though its at full charge. (This never happened to me when I was using AA's)"
5,Essential for gamers,"If you play your Xbox a lot like I do, you will definitely need this. The battery tends to last me several weeks on one charge and they can even charge while the console is off, so you don't have to be wired if you don't want to. I also recommend theXbox 360 Quick Charge Kitwhich can charge multiple batteries at once."
1,Poor quality,"I bought this battery pack as a backup to my ageing rechargeable batteries but so far it has given me nothing but trouble. It doesn't seem to hold a charge very long, which leaves me playing with a wireless control tethered to the console. It also takes very long to charge and never seems to reach full charge.(full 4 bars on the controller battery icon)"
4,Xbox 360 black play & charge kit,Great to keep your xbox 360 wireless control charged. Best part is you can use it while still charging. Helps in that you don't have to buy more batteries.
2,"Questionable battery life, terrible longevity...","I bought two of these last year for my 360. They worked great but I didn't get the best battery life out of them. I had to recharge them between once a week and twice a week with moderate use. After 6 months of moderate to regular use, the batteries failed. Since then I switched to rechargeable AA batteries and they last quite a bit longer and it was about 26 for a set of batteries (4 AAs and 2AAAs) and a charger. I would recommend going with a good set of rechargeable batteries over play and charge kits."
3,Gr8 item 4 charging BUT,"Fast & easy to plug in & play while your battery charges .Charge your battery while you play.GR8 idea & works ok BUT after 4-5 times of using this,the unit tends to fall out of the controller & the wire in the way can be a pain in the butt while playing.It's a good idea but you're honestly better off buying a spare battery and a dual battery battery charger."
4,Good!!,"Very good, but the cable is grey man...that's a little bizarre looking with the black controller and console...but what can you do...Buy it!!"
5,Worked as advertised,"This product did what it was supposed to do, charge the battery pack while I played and allowed me to continue playing wirelessly after unplugging it when the battery was fully charged."
5,xbox 360 cable,My nephew needed a new cable for his xbox 360. He wanted one that would match his old one and we found it on Amazon.com. Works great and he's very happy. Thank you Amazon.com
4,Good Purchase...,Now I could play more hours wireless. I ordered this item and arrived just in time when my original wireless control batteries got dead...
4,Bye Bye Batteries!! and Hello to Charging!!,"Are you one of those people when they play online like Halo, and when you face someone and suddenly your controller won't respond, and then you realize that you need to replace your batteries, well i was one of those people and my problem buying batteries also ended with this play & charge.in the end i would really recommend for those hard players to buy this because it will end the age of using batteries."
2,Overrated - skip this,"These batteries do not last long, be warned. If you're going to not play your Xbox for long periods of time, it's best to remove the battery pack from the controller. I've made the mistake of leaving the battery pack in, and now I've got a battery that won't take a charge, and it's only a few months old! I've sworn off Play & Charge from now on, as the battery quality is extremely low obviously. Instead I'd recommend some goodSanyo NEW 1500 eneloop 4 Pack AA Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteriesand this charger:Maha Powerex Wizard One MH-C9000 Advanced Battery Charger and Analyzer - Free Deluxe Storage Case Included. Unlike the Play & Charge battery pack, the Eneloops retain their charge very well even over a period of a year or more. This is a far better route to go, IMO."
1,didnt work,the play and charge kit didint work wouldnt charge and it wasnt the xbox look like new but sure didnt work as one.
2,gives me trouble,The cord started working for a little while and at some point in time it decides to only work when the cord it place in a specific way.
2,Definitely not a genuine Microsoft Charger,"I should have known from the beginning this wouldn't be a genuine Microsoft product, but I decided to give it a shot anyway. After only a few months it doesn't hold a charge, and the battery seems to be cracking apart. For the price it's okay if you have no other options, but I would recommend spending a little more on a better quality product."
3,Xbox 36- Black Play Review,I would not recommend this product to everyone since the battery had to be replaced after less than one year of use. I have found better batteries out there.
1,Battery Dead,I finally decided to buy this product since it wasn't a 3rd party product. I thought it would last me more than a year. When i first received it I charged it and it worked great for a few weeks.I didnt charge the battery for a few months since I did not need to use it but when I tried to charge it with the cable that was provided it didn't work so I tried to charge it in the quick charge kit and that didn't work either. I called microsoft and they were of no help. Batteries have only a 90 day warranty. If you are buy this product for the battery then DO NOT DO IT. I'm sure there are other options out there. I now have a dead battery and am using AA batteries again. :(
1,DOA,"Unit does not work. I followed the instructions and gave it adequate charge, however unit still does not work. Tried the battery in 3 different controllers to narrow down the problem and in all 3 it did not work. I followed the Microsoft suggested troubleshooting guide, with no luck. I'm honestly to busy to deal with calling Microsoft and go through the hassle of shipping. So, I have a paper weight at least..."
3,charger great buy,Good charger works good very easy to use plug and play literally I would recommended this to a friend. Its better that buying all kinds of batteries. Saves you some money in the end
1,It works but has some shortfalls (UPDATE: doesn't work),"Pros:- On a full charge it lasts about as long as AA batteries, maybe a little less- Being able to plug the cable in to keep playing after the battery runs out is usefulCons:- I can't get a full charge out of it by plugging it into the Xbox itself, I have to plug it into my PC (on the Xbox, the LED light will go from red to off after many hours, on the PC it goes from red to green (fully charged))- Takes many hours (10 or more) for a full charge- The charging cable had a bad, almost burnt-plastic smell for a week after opening itUPDATE 01/23/12: After a cycle or two of using this, I couldn't get more than 5 hours of gaming before the battery would die. I left it charging for quite a long time each time, too (12+ hours), but it never seemed to fill up all the way. I returned it and am now using a pair of Eneloop rechargable batteries instead."
5,Excellent Item,"Having been a bit behind on my accessories, I picked this play n charge pack up yesterday. As soon as I hooked it up to me XBox 360, and plugged it into my controller I knew I bought a great item.I was able to play my games while the controller was charging and could see the charge taking place from my dashboard screen which shows the battery icon filling up.The best thing about this charger is the length of the cord. In my setup, I have to sit approximately six feet away from my television, and this cord reached with no issue, as opposed to my PS3 which only stretches about two feet.I recommend this to any XBox user, as it will save you from the frustration of running out on batteries at an inopportune time and will save you money in the long run as batteries are never cheap."
5,Works just as its suppose to.,"The product was shipped in a timely manner, it was exactly how it was described and works just as it should."
5,No batteries,I love this thing never have to buy batteries again very useful and a good investment to make for your xbox
2,The battery really doesn't hold a charge for that long...,"At first I was loving this! I didn't have to buy any AA batteries anymore (which made me feel like I was my grandmother). I am all, ""This is 2012 Noni, get something that recharges!""After about a year my wireless controller has basically turned back into a wired controller. I bought two of these at separate times and both are similar in the quite fast decline in charge holding.Fairly weak, or maybe my expectations of batteries are just far too high."
1,Will not hold a charge,"I've had this play and charge kit for 6 months now, and haven't written a review just because. In a nutshell the first week of having the battery pack, it held a charge once or twice. After that I have had to keep the charging cable plugged in to use my controller. I would suggest getting the play and charge kit from best buy and paying the extra $ if only to save the shipping and handling fees and avoid the turnaround time if you have to return the item."
1,HATE IT,Bought This For My Boyfriend For Christmas And The Damn Thing Never Worked. Total Waste Of $30. Better Off Just Buying It From An Actual Store It Would Be Easier To Return..
1,Well i got it great timing and everything,"Looked new, thought it would work, set it to charge and to my surprise it was actually not working same as the other one i was trying to replace that fried. Not cool."
1,Stops working,"I was playing swat on halo 4, in the middle of the map, shooting at an opponent when suddenly *beeb* please reconnect controller. How can this be? Ive had it charged, the light shows green which means charged right? Wrong. My killing spree is over and by this time I'm raging hard because it was the first day that swat came on the multiplayer. I tried charging it on my laptop but the light never goes red it just stays green. Shouldve just paid the 5 extra bucks for the quick charge kit. F***."
2,Very Dissapointed.,"I received my plug and charge kit in and tattered casing but that isn't that issue. I could care less about what it came in, the battery pack and wire were in great LOOKING condition until I tried to put the pack in my controller and wouldn't stay in. I thought the problem was my controller so I grabbed two other controllers and tried but same thing. So I put it in my controller and begin to bang it in so it would lock in place and after about 7 HARD hits it stuck. Even though it's in the controller the button which releases the battery pack is still depressed. It charges but I'm a bit scared of ever taking the pack out because everytime it gets harder to bang it back in.Be careful when buying used goods Amazonians."
4,Change,"This is an excelente product and a solution for batteries AA; I spent so much money in this batteries, but now with this charge kit i save money and enjoy more with mi XBOX360 console."
4,"Great Product, few problems","This is a great product. There are many pros and few cons.Pros - It replaces your batteries, you don't need to buy them anymorePlay AND Charge - it allows you to charge while you play which allows you to charge faster.Simple - it is really simple to use, just plug it in to the controller and then to the console.Cons - Sometimes it is difficult to remove the plug from the controllerThe batter will slowly lose its charge over time which means you will either not be able to charge it or it will lose its charge very quickly. It is really easy to replace and it isn't a hassle and it definately is less expensive to use disposable batteries.Overall - 4 stars - simple to use, very reliable, and overall a better value then disposable batteries"
3,"Worked fine in the beginning, then dead batteries!","I purchased these at bestbuy to avoid the knockoff versions. Still the charge kit worked very well in the first 6 months. Then I left my xbox in box for a year, finally it's time to clear off the dust and play some games. The rechargeable battery is completely dead. Now I ended up with a wired controller.Do not buy this if you like to hold the controller without wire.Buy come decent quality rechargeable batteries, much more reliable."
5,I've got the Power!,This tool is nice to have around to hel keep my controllers charged so that I don't have to run and find batteries.
1,Broke within 6 months,Not sure if this is a common occurrence but mine broke within 6 months of use. I can still play with the controller while plugged in but it no longer charges the battery.
1,Unhappy with the time lasted,"This thng didn't even last a WEEK! Only for the first 2 days it managed to charge it. Then the next day, i would stop charging, but remain like a wired control. The next day, it stopped working all together. I might have had a faulty one, but still, that was a total piece of trash!"
2,"Unreliable, then unusable","I bought this kit along with a black wireless controller when Amazon had the bundle as a gold box deal a few months ago. It worked fine for a couple of weeks, then I started to notice that the battery was lasting shorter and shorter periods of playtime. Now it doesn't hold a charge at all. I plug it in and the light glows red for a second, then goes green. Unplug and the controller is dead.Luckily it came with a standard battery pack and I now have rechargeable AA batteries and a charger, so I will just go that route and see if it works a little better. As a note, I also bought a white play/charge kit about 6 months before the black one, and it still works fine as of now. Guess it's luck of the draw on these, which is disappointing."
2,The play and charge kit stopped working within a few months.,"I bought two of these, and both stopped working not long after I bought them. I assume its the rechargeable battery, but not sure. Of course, it was out of warranty. I'm back to using the AA batteries."
1,3 out of 3 Dead Packs,"I bought one of these kits and rec'd 2 extra battery packs as stocking stuffers. I didn't get around to using it for some time - just didn't have time for gaming for awhile, but when I did all three of the battery packs refused to charge at all. Could be the cable - but it works to power the controller ok, just over-priced, crappy batteries.Do yourself a favor - buy rechargeables, you'll be better off in the long run - and the short run too!"
3,Don't expect much.,"I did not purchase this from Amazon, but rather from my local Target and I am glad I did.The first one I bought charged my controller twice and then the battery pack stopped holding a charge. I returned it, bought another one, weeks later, same problem, the battery pack stopped holding a charge after about three to four charges. I will be stopping at Target today to return it to purchase -ANOTHER- one of these.Don't get me wrong, I think this item is great. The battery holds a charge for a very long time and I use the controller quite often (netflix, games, movies) so it's nice to not have to worry about putting fresh batteries in. It's just really, really annoying that Microsoft can't make a quality product that doesn't crap out almost immediately (insert windows OS joke).I took two stars away because even though I like this product and I would love to rate it five stars, having to return it two times now (and more likely MORE) to find a working one is just flippin' ridiculous."
2,Too many issues.,"I bought this for my xbox about 2 months ago and its starting to have problems already. Major problems. It worked great for the first 2 months than things went south. I hooked in the charger and it would charge 2 seconds.. not exaggerating. Than it would light up green to say it was charged. I unhook the charger and controller died. I even left the Xbox on for the whole day while the controller was hooked in and it still didnt charge. I googled the problem and contacted customer support and they said I have a dead battery. LIE! My friend let me borrow his quick charge and I placed it in the charging dock and POOF it works. Not the battery.. its the chord. Tried with several other batteries same deal. Go for the quick charge<<<what I own now, Its a little more about 5 bucks more but its worth it!!"
4,"Great Product, The 2nd I have owned","1st, when rating this product amazon asks ""how much fun is this game?"" and 2nd ""How do you rate this game overall?"" This product is not a game. Overall I give it four stars, the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because it seems like regular batteries or other brand rechargeable batteries hold a charge longer. It doesn't really matter since you can play and charge at the same time but if you prefer to sit further from yur console this may cause a problem. I love this kit tho, it is the second one I have owned in 7 years."
1,What a joke,"The product page indicates it is a Microsoft official product, but the product I got from ""Super Fast Delivery"" was a cheap knockoff from China. Order at your own risk."
2,Bad wire,"I got this play and charge kit but in the end I regret it. While the battery was good and would hold a charge, thwe wire would make a buzzing noise everytime i plugged it in. Never will buy from this seller again"
2,The Charge doesn't last as long as advertised.,"Waste of money, the charge does not hold in the battery pack at all. I suggest all to avoid and to cough up more money for the more expensive plug and play model."
4,Good Save On Batteries,"I got this mainly because I did not want to waste two AA batteries anymore and have them run out to the point where I would have to go out a buy more. It's a waste of money. The play and charge kit is a good choice based on the fact you can play while it charges and never have to worry about your controller shutting off on you, so you can go search for more batteries, especially during a game. I believe it doesn't matter what color the LED is when its plugged. Whether red, or green it still charged for me. It charges super fast. My only problem was that sometimes it would overheat. Just remember if you're going to use this, do not have it plugged in too long for extended periods of time. If its overheated you should unplug it immediately because that signifies it has more than enough power."
1,horrible book,"Have read many RS books. This guy used mostly secondary resources. Very disappointed. All over tone of the book, he's definitely NOT enamored of his subjects."
4,"It's only a rock and roll bio, but it's not bad","Sure, the Stones' story has been told before, but Davis deserves credit for synthesizing the whole 40-year saga in one highly entertaining book. The beginning is the best: he gives us mini bios of the Stones before they were the Stones -- before they even knew each other -- and shows us the fateful paths each took that led to formation of the group. Of meeting Mick in that Dartford train station, Keith says ""it was like Robert Johnson at the crossroads. An understanding was made"" (or something close to that). Awesome. There is also much more detail about Brian Jones than I'd read elsewhere, probably because I haven't read the right Stones books.The ending is also inspired -- and again features a vignette about Keith."
3,Starts out more interesting than it ends.,The book is a page-turner particularly in the first half where the author seems to address the musicality of the band explaining the various music sources for appropriation and how the band made the music it's own. The contribution of Brian Jones to both the original band and to the future pulse on world music were interesting and often overlooked by writings that seem to emphasize his drug use and untimely death. The suggestion that he was murdered could have been explored in more detail. The last half of the book seems to be a chronological listing of the most famous of escapades and development of rifts between band members that lacks detail or an exploration of how it affects the music. The book is interesting enough to keep the pages turning.
4,Old God and Stones are comprehensive,A generally well-written and reasonably (2002) up-to-date volume with minor errors here and there. Easy to read and useful information.
1,Fact or Fiction?,"Mr. Davis' book would perhaps be better filed under fiction. His research is sloppy and a number of 'facts' are just untrue. It is disappointing that Mr. Davis has to sensationalize what is already an incredible story of a band that has survived forty years in rock and roll. More factual books on the Stones are Bill Wyman's 'Stone Alone' and James Phelge's 'Nankering with the Rolling Stones'. As for 'Old Gods Almost Dead', save your money...or better still, go and buy a great old Stones CD, sit back and enjoy the magic!"
3,"Sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll, more drugs ...","I picked up ""Old Gods Almost Dead"" not because I'm a huge Stones fan (although I was present at the ""Steel Wheels"" kickoff show in Philadelphia in 1989), but because I'd read and enjoyed Stephen Davis' excellent biography of Led Zeppelin, ""Hammer Of The Gods."" ""Old Gods ..."" is very readable, despite Davis' occasional rock-journalist-pretentious prose and dubious sources (I'm sorry, anyone who uses Pamela Des Barres' gushfest ""I'm With The Band"" as a credited source is suspect). Davis covers the Brian Jones years extensively and colorfully, then glosses over everything else except the copious amounts and types of drugs consumed by the band. Non-fans will find the book interesting reading; diehards will dislike the tabloid tones. And just a nitpick, Mr. Davis--Keith Richards' wife's name is Patti Hansen, not Hanson ..."
5,great book - great style,"Ive always loved the semi-cartoony style of artists like Ryan Dunlavey and Ben Caldwell. I always wanted to learn how to draw this way. when i saw this book on amazon, i was amazed at how lucky I was to find it! once i got It, i started using it right away. it was a great book and i learned ssssooooo much from it that i wouldve otherwise never known. this book improved the quality of my drawings so much more than i couldve imagined and i bet it can to the same to yours."
5,Wow!,"I've bought this book, read it (noticing some instructionalerrors - but nothing you can self-correct) and started to draw(rather copy) the examples. The results: Self-satisfaction.This is a good book to start with if you plan to animateaction cartoons in the future (on paper or on the computer).After I draw all the examples in this book, it would be a goodexcercise to use Mr. Caldwell's principles and draw my owncharacters.I wish though that this book had examples on non-human characterslike robots, machines, animals, aliens, monsters, etc.Another book of this nature perhaps, Mr. Caldwell?"
5,Excellent,"I have several books on drawing the human figure and this is in the top two. Lots of great ideas and examples, and they're all very carefully drawn to avoid throwing the student off. Some books have vague or confusing examples; the examples here are always clear and straightforward and easy to mimic. Great examples of head poses; over the shoulder, tilted, etc., in relationship to the body.I bought this used for a pittance and boy, did I ever get a bargain."
4,LIGHTS! CAMERA! Hold on a second!,"This is a great book for an artist who has some experience already drawing the human figure looking to flesh out their skills in the world of cartooning. The book gives you all the hints and tips you need to take a human and make them a bit more cartoony, showing the action inherent in the scene, and whatever else it is that makes action cartoons tick.Unfortunately, as a novice artist? This was only helpful in helping me draw the exact figures they have in the book. I can now walk through and recreate almost anything in the book but taking it to the next step? That's just not there for me.I don't blame the book for this. It really is a great tool for getting to the next step in cartooning, but I guess I just needed something a little more basic."
5,excellent book,This book was easy to read and packed with information. It shows how to draw a typical person and then how to adjust that to make cartoon people. It was recommended by my art class and I recommend it to anyone interested in cartooning.
3,Never goes beyond the pencil sketch.,"This is a pretty good book for the hobbyist who wants to improve his or her drawing skills, but there's no information beyond that. What do professional cartoonists do once they've finished sketching? We're never told. There's nothing about transitioning from pencil to pen, or what kind of pens to use, no mention of light boards or lettering or laying out panels, not one word about color. Do professional cartoonists use computers for any of this? We're not told. Frankly, I was disappointed. (Not to mention a tad turned off by the ""Don't worry, guys!"" on the back cover. What is this, the fifties?) I was looking specifically for that information, and would have given this book two stars, but you get what you pay for."
1,What are the track listings???,"What songs are on this CD???? It would be nice to list all the songs on this CD, so please do so if you can sellers."
5,Love it!,I'm not a belly dancer; I just got this mp3 download album because I enjoy middle eastern music. I love this compilation which is my first introduction to Hossam Ramzy.My favorite track is #2. Sallam Allay (My Beloved Greeted Me).I use this music as background music when I'm doing personal routines like showering and getting ready for bed. Also occassionally after getting up while washing my face and putting on make-up. The music is both relaxing and energetic which is amazing. It really puts me in a good mood.
3,Funky sounds of Hossam Ramzy,"I bought this Cd based on other reviews and unfortunatly was not impressed very much. Considering Ive heard better versions of the songs played on this Cd, Im glad I didnt pay too much for it. My personal opinion: the music was flat sounding as there wasnt much complexity to the music. Was as if a few essential instruments were left out of the band. I guess it may be good for someone new to this kind of music, but not for the well- seasoned listener/dancer."
5,Excellent product,"I've been using this brand of niacin for years. It's been instrumental in increasing my good cholesterol 50%, and my LDL has decreased 25%."
5,Works well!,"I have been taking this to improve my lipid profile for the past 3 years. So far, it's done everything I'd expected though to get to an effective dose takes a while. For most folks (to reduce your bad cholesterol, etc.) the target dose is between 2000 mg and 5000 mg. It's the only brand I'll take as it works and is vegan."
1,When you say vegetable capsule I only expect to see vegatable capsule as a ingredient and not magnesium stearate,"I'm becoming increasingly frustrated with Solgars; one of the reasons I trusted and brought Solgars was because of the only ingredients in their capsule was vegetable cellulose. I am now seeing more and more Magnesium Stearate in their products. There is still an ongoing debate about whether Magnesium Stearate is toxic to the body or not and some say it also decreases the absorption of nutrients, so whenever in doubt I choose to buy from another manufacturer. Maybe I'll buy from megafood for now on ."
3,Good but not very good,"""You raise me up"" isn't the best track that one has heard of Westlife. The lyrics are great but the music and the style of the band lets the song down. They make it too loud and the undulation of the music hurts the ear. You won't listen to the song over and over again. Instead I like Brian Kennedy's version better. This song is better suited when sung solo than when sung in a group."
5,These are great,"I have been using the coleman big ol' nail with a collar tent stakes for years. They don't break or bend and they don't come out of the ground under stress, but they are heavy and hard to pull out. I bought these tent stakes to take on RAGBRAI 2010 and guess what? They don't break or bend and they don't come out of the ground under stress, BUT they are light, easy to pack and they pull out of the ground smooth and easy. I have never been a believer in aluminum tent stakes, but these are terrific. I am very satisfied that I bought them."
2,foot rippers,"The stakes are strong and light, but they have one flaw which is a problem on trips that aren't very cold. The end of the stake that pokes up out of the ground is very sharp, and if you kick it in the dark wearing sandals or barefoot, it will hurt and can really rip away a piece of flesh. This can be a big problem in the back country. It's happened to us! If you're going someplace where for sure there will be no bare feet near the tents, these stakes are great. But summer meadows and river side campsites, or if you're partying and likely to go out to pee barefoot. Watch out!"
5,A Fantastic Beginner's Book,"This book is great for the person who either wants to learn to spin with a drop spindle or who has just learned. There are several articles that give clear descriptions of how to use high and low whorl spindles, supported spindles and how to make your own. There are even drawings showing the spinner how to hold her/his hands to cut down on discomfort. The articles are written in a very conversational tone so that you feel like one of your friends is telling you about the craft. There are also stories by people who have used wheels for years and have recently decided to pick up a spindle. This is a great collection."
2,"Reprinted Spin-Off articles, outdated.","This is a collection of old spinning articles from the first days of Spin-Off Magazine. Some of the stuff in here is really outdated and smacks of the hippie years, like, making a spinning hook from trimmed branches, or a drop spindle from sticks stuck in potatoes. Not all that interesting or useful any more. Some of the articles seem unedited and quite amateurish. Some of the technique is timeless, but some has gone out of vogue.There are many great spinning books available now. I'd recommend you pass on this one."
5,"many are called, but few are chosen...","Why am I recommending this album, amid all of Robert Nest Marley's other great albums? Because Rebel Music is such a powerful and consistent collection, interconnecting a strong set of some of Bob's heaviest hitting, non-mainstreamed songs.The mood and meaning of each song transitions beautifully into the next one, beginning in descriptive-of-life songs, deepening into reflection, and culminating in the messianic call-to-action of ""Ride Natty Ride"", ""Chase the Baldheads"" and ""Getup Standup"".Also, the song ""roots"" I haven't seen on other albums (its one of my all-time favorites)."
4,Panasnic RP DJ1200A,"As a matter of fact I get the item based on previous reviews, it is my first time with this kind of headphones. Considering the price and quality it was worth. I like it"
4,Everything is awesome except...,Top notch headphones. If you want lots of bass look elsewhere.Everything is perfect I just wish the cups were a lot bigger.
5,Perfect Headphones!,I bought these headphones as a gift for my boyfriend and he LOVES them. He's been a DJ for 8 years and he's never owned anything with better sound or comfort. The quality is excellent compared to the flimsy Sony MDR-V700 which break easily. They look great and aren't too heavy. Worth every penny.
4,"Great cans!!! Comfortable, super durable!!!","These cans are great!!! Really comfortable for long hours of use and they have a really good sound quality and isolation. I've had them for 5 years & they're still working fine. I now switched to Sennheiser HD25-1 II which are fantastic cans, by far the best headphones I've used, but as a second choice I would definitely go for these, plus the price-tag is considerably lower. Technics is top notch!!"
4,"Excellent to hear, not easy to use.","The sound quality is excellent however the size of the handset is relatively small, which makes the continued use a bit uncomfortable because of the pressure on the external area of the ears. Besides, the buttons to lock and release are slightly fragile for constant use and suggest a possible decline after some time. The handset cable could also be removable but the quality is excellent and being coiled allows great mobility. Beyond that, the adapter P10/P2 is incredibly convenient and sturdy. The sound isolation is not perfect and if the sound set is adjusted to low volume you can hear the ambient sound (though not bother to come because of the high quality of sound reproduction of the set)."
3,RPDJ1200's,"These headphones were not what I expected.. I Guess i should have done more research. I thought the cups would be bigger and fit over my ears, but they don't. The swivel idea is cool but eventually the lock slips and they swivel when you dont expect it. I would personally reccomend the RPDH-1200's because they have the Over ear design, a detachable cord, and The worlds #1 DJ Armin Van Buuren has been rocking them over the past years, a guy who cares about music."
5,amazing.,"I bought these on a recommendation of a fried. 4 YEARS AGO! Since then I've traveled around the world several times with them and beat them to hell. And they still work like new! I love them and I'm buying another pair now just because I'm afraid one day these will break and I'll have to buy a new pair and won't be able to find them. If I had the money I'd buy 3 more pairs, but they might last longer than I'll ever need them.Totally happy. Get these headphones if you like stuff that doesn't suck."
4,Cute shoe,These are very cute and comfortable if you are used to walking in these types of shoes (no back). Would recommend.
5,A guide to exquisite living,"I thoroughly enjoyed Lippincott's last novel, ""Mr Dalloway"", and I was eager to read his new one, but I don't know why I waited so long. ""Our Arcadia"" is a gorgeous story of a group of friends who create a haven on Cape Cod in order to pursue art in all its many forms (painting, architecture, living, sculpture, writing, loving). In 1928, Lark (a gay man) and Nora (a divorced mother of two) buy a house in Truro on Cape Cod, and seek to people it with fellow artists. The novel follows the next fifteen years as life takes many paths for each of True House's denizens. Taking elements of Virginia Woolf and E. M. Forster (among others), and injecting a wholly American element, Lippincott created a cohesive piece that inspires and challenges standard storytelling. Like Carole Maso's works, ""Our Arcadia"" seeks to make a new path of literature, and does so with a graceful, feminine beauty. Without a doubt, this is one of the best books of 2001."
5,Like a Painting,"This book, as the title implies, is a masterful work of brushstokes only with words. The beauty of this story carried me into a realm of daydreams. How, I too, would love to find my Arcadia. Its simple story, its characters are all woven onto a canvas with pages. I reccommend this book for the simple pleasure of maybe helping someone ""learn how to live""."
4,Strangely evocative,"Lippincott is a truly unique writer, persistant in his vision. One can hardly do more than salue the richness and strangeness, the odd illuminations of this book. The story is rare, accurate; the prose reflects a delicate sensibility, a moodiness that expresses a kind of poetry that one simply does not find in most cookie-cutter novels of the day. This writer deserves a wide audience, with readers patient enough to receive his deceptively light vision."
4,Painting with words,"As both Edmund White and Ned Rorem suggest in their endorsements of OUR ARCADIA, Lippincott is up to something completely new and different here, and he succeeds marvelously. The form of the book--the many short chapters, and Lippincott's suggestive, painterly style, fit the content perfectly, leaving room for the reader and thus pulling him or her in far more than most traditional (and often overly heavy-handed) narratives. This is a sublime work of art, and one that will live."
2,"Well-Written, But Overwrought","While Mr. Lippincott certainly knows how to handle a pen (or, perhaps, laptop), this reader found OUR ARCADIA to be overwrought and rather too ""precious"" to be enjoyable and/or believable. Not a single character in the book's numerous short chapters was really likeable and most were downright annoying! Although the book is diminutive, it proved difficult (impossible!) to read more than a bit at a stretch...such was the soporific spell it cast.Mr. Lippincott is technically talented--there's no question of that--but when it comes to telling a story that truly engages a reader he seems to have much to learn."
3,Not what I expected.,"I didn't expect this to contain so much history. Of course, the history of how these discoveries were made give a lot of insight but I was expecting more story-telling. I wanted to read more about the animals lives during their transitions (not in a fictitious way). Keep in mind, Carl Zimmer is a journalist, this book is extremely wordy. I would recommend Neil Shubin's ""Your Inner Fish."" Inner Fish is more up to date, shorter, and Shubin does an excellent job detailing short and simply. Zimmer actually mentions Shubin in this book."
1,WORST grater I've ever used!,"I bought this grater for its knuckle saving feature, but it is by far the WORST grater I've ever used. It simply does NOT grate ANYTHING much less your knuckles. I'm going to use it as a florist's frog to arrange flowers, and thank my lucky stars I bought it from Amazon on sale at half the price in the stores."
3,need bottle brush to clean,wonderfully feeling grater and works well. it's just really difficult to clean. i have to get a bottle brush to clean it properly and hopefully that will work.
5,I love Claudia Ciuti shoes,A great value. My mistake was that I got 6.5 but they are true to size so buy the real size you have. They are very stylish and good for evening.
1,Waste of talent,"After having purchased the first greatest hits and loved it, I thought that I would buy Vol. 2. BIG MISTAKE. Vol. 1 had all of the Stylistics big hits which covered their first three albums, and also had differant producers than most of the songs on Vol. 2. I feel like I got duped into buying Vol. 2 because of one song, ""You'll Never Get To Heaven"" which coincidentally was off of one of their first three albums. The rest of the songs on Vol. 2 are musically soulless, lifeless, and heartless."
3,Daisy review,Nice informative paperback. No prices for us collectors/dealers. Does anyone publish a price guide for BB guns?
4,Daisy collector book,"The book 100 years of Daisy BB guns is excellent, great pix, very informataive and a must have for the Daisy BB gun fan, collector or shooter. I would have liked more written text but book is great and helpful as it is. I have a few Daisy bb guns but dont concentrate on them. Try it youll like it."
3,"Great band, fire the terrible vocalist","Lord Worm hands down is the worst Death metal vocalist I've ever heard. He's got this awful high pitched harmonic in his generally low growls that sound as if his voice is changing. Not only that but I don't think he's actually singing any words, it all sounds like ""wuuhh whuhh whuhh whuh whuhh."" F--ing awful, and he ruins what is otherwise a tremendous death metal album. I know its odd to not like a Death Metal band solely on the vocals but they just piss me off to such a violent degree that the music is ruined for me. Give me Dave Vincent or Chris Barnes or even Luc Lemay from Gorguts any day. The drumming is insane and the guitars are extraordinarily brutal and technical. Great bass playing too, but I'm sorry Lord Worm SUCKS. I can't stand the f**cker."
1,This is not music!,"This the worst excuse for a band that I've ever heard. You can find lyrics for the songs, but there is no way the lead singer is saying anything, just grunting.Purely distgusting and ultimately disturbing..."
1,Your kidding right?,this has to be a joke..this band can't be for realI mean I love death metal and choatic music as much as the next guy..but this is total crap...he sounds like he is barking into the microphone half the time and all of the instruments are totally off. this makes me cry..if you have a single brain cell you will not buy this cd...ewww
1,This Band Is A Joke!!,"Whats happening peeps?? Wow, where to start with these fellas, first off they have probably the worst singer I've ever heard, he just does this deep grunt 'n growl thing through every song, its boring and annoying, second is the guitar player, learn some darn chords!! Fast random strumming don't count as guitar playing!! The drumber needs to learn to keep pace, he's all over the place and his timing don't make sense to me at all!! The artwork looks hateful on the album cover, and is not called for at all!! I like harder edged musik, but this is taking things too darn far. For good musik, I say buy any album from bands like Hawthorne Heights, Fall Out Boy, Atreyu, KoRn, Linkin Park, Taking Back Sunday, Avenged Sevenfold, Limp Bizkit, Staind, Disturbed, Avril Lavigne, the punk legends Green Day & Good Charlotte and the melodic majesty of Coldplay and Oasis!! These bands have good guitar work and good singers you can actually understand!! Go Bengals!!!"
5,Best Cryptopsy album,"Cryptopsy's ""None So Vile"" is one of the most insane Death Metal records of the 90's in terms of vocal style, drumming and rapid fire guitar work. In my opinion Cyyptopsy aren't worth listening to beyond this and ""Blasphemy Made Flesh"". If you like your metal to be relentlessly brutal in every respect of the word then this is one of the only albums you'll ever need. It's nonstop serious metal from the first drum roll to the last growl."
5,When fiber and prune juice is not enough,"Man where do I start here, well here I go.This album basically is the epitome of X-death metal, shear brutallity, vicious drumming, guitar that does what it was originally intended for, bass that is used as a bass and a second guitar and a singer that gives fear is the hearts of men and that adds up to Cryptopsy.over 30 minutes of raw metal entering your skull and leaves you feeling like you survived and accident yet you want to try it again. If you like or are trying to get into death metal, start off slow then proceed with caution if not then good luck. If you already have this album then you know what i'm talking about."
5,The Most Psychotic Band I've Ever Heard.,"These guys are amazing. I've been listening to Death Metal since back in the days when it first appeared. Monster bands back then that were coming out were, Death, Deicide, Cannibal Corpse, Immolation, and so on. I always wished that these bands would have evovled into the tecnical death metal monster that is Cryptopsy. I have yet to find ANY band that is as technical and brutal as Cryptopsy. Lord Worm, despite many people saying his vocals suck, is a killer front man, making his demented singing mesh perfect with the unbelievable musical monster that is Cryptopsy. And Flo's drumming is Godly. This and Once Was Not are their best two releases. Everything else by them is as amazing as well, but play those two back to back and you'll be scraping pieces of your brain off of the ceiling for days.Necrosoul."
5,Intelligent & insane combine together. = cryptopsy.,"That's all that realy has to be said about this great and excellent band known as cryptopsy and il admit after lord worn left cryptopsy? I was depressed and im so glad he's back with them! Cryptopsy's "" none so vile"" is the assult you wish never ended."
4,"Brutal and striaghtforward, but still technical as hell","This album is what I would call a better-than-average album by a (carreer, this lineup was pretty spectacular) average band, to say the least.Lord Worm delivers brutal inaudible vocals (you can kind of understand him if you know the lyrics...which are actually some of the best lyrics i've heard in a technical dm band), backed by fast paced extremely downtuned guitars, relentless drums and an average bassist to kick. Eric Langois delivers some low-end mayhem, while Flo Mounier (drums) destroys on his set, his patterns and tempo changes are really exceptional. A fan of any extreme metal should pick this one up."
5,This is what the inside of a meatgrinder must sound like.,"It saddens me that this was Lord Worm's last album with the band. His witty, erudite, playful lyrics stood head and shoulders above what most other death outfits come up with.And the music, wow. I think the only thing that comes close in raw scary energy is Napalm Death's From Enslavement to Obliteration.Foul, cruel, inhuman, irrevocable mayhem performed with transhuman speed and precision, this release is a solid 6 out of 5 stars."
5,greatest death album ever,"i've already said it, greatest death metal album ever. it doesn't get much better than slit your guts! long live lord worm!"
1,Historically bad game,"This game brings back fond memories for me as the worst game I ever played. I laugh every time I think about it. The controls were impossible, there was no manual other than a single piece of paper that gave no indication of what to do in the game, a dumb guy who followed you around presumably to help you but actually just watched you get beat up by the impossibly tough guards, and the music... The music was relentless. It was like this up-tempo electronic nursery rhyme that looped endlessly without any break while the game was on. That was the only sound. Turn the game on, turn the TV up, and be surprised at the *angry* response you get from roommates in under 5 minutes."
5,"""Prides Deadly Fury""",This is a great film and difficult (until recently) to find...very nicely done with wonderful drama and gong-fu (Bagua). Worth every cent of it's cost...
2,Great DVD if you speak Chinese,"Pride's Deadly Fury is a great Chinese martial arts film. I was very happy to finally see the first DVD edition of this classic for sale on Amazon.However, when I received my copy I was disappointed to find that while this was an all region DVD, there were no subtitles. So if you do not speak Chinese you will miss all the nuances of this film. This is too bad as what makes this a great film is the story and character development along with the martial arts action.So the film Pride's Deadly Fury gets 5 stars but the DVD gets itself get 2 stars. If someone produces a subtitled version or even a dubbed version there will be plenty of martial arts movie fans who will buy this. But for now, unless you speak Chinese......"
5,An Awesome Movie!,"One of the few great anime films that are good for the family! The movie could have easily been a best-selling book! I would recommend this movie to anyone, whether he/she likes anime or not!"
5,a great flic,"Even tho this film was the type of anime made for chics~i feel that anyone watching it would just fall in love with the movie, the way i did. It uses a great deal of symbolism < that is just simply amazing> and also is very dramatic. definetly fun for the whole family to watch/ unlike other animes it has no porn or nudity. however I would definetly have to warn anyone tho~ this movie is a real tear jerker!!"
1,Poorly made,I have only had this for a short time and I took it off during the winter months. The paint faded in a few weeks and it split and cracked badly before a year was up.
4,Putting back the soul into R&B.,"The stand-out tracks that hit me instantly are ""All That I Can Say"" and ""As"". Although the latter is more of a George Micheal showcase, Mary manages to put a touch of class and when she comes on, the track really grooves. On further listening, the rest of the album got to me and I'm sure it will do the same to you too. With this effort, Mary has put a little soul back into modern day R&B. Often compared to Lauryn Hill, it's really a matter of taste but Mary sure has loads of class."
3,Not bad,I have tasted this iced tea for a few weeks. It is OK. But the claimed beneficial effects are unknown.
1,a static bore full of cliches,"The pace of this movie is so slow it would, at times, seem to be a series of slides, with the sounds of the Venezuelan countryside as the most prominent feature in a lackluster soundtrack. The photography is beautiful, as are the lush and exotic locations. This is a story of a mature woman remembering her first love, as her niece is visiting with her. It is told in flashbacks. I really don't know if the story is confusing because of the script, or because silent scenes are so long you fall asleep in between them."
4,very Talented Cat,"still dig his first album the best overall from his catelog, but these songs reflect a Artist who is a very talented vocalist, songwriter, producer, arranger&overall instrumentalist. I hope we get more of his talents in the years to come. this is a Good Collection that showcases a very Talented Artist."
5,Essential!,"This is an essential album for Brian McKnight fans! Most of his popular tracks are on this album, including ""6, 8 , 12"", ""Back At One"", ""One Last Cry"", and ""Anytime"". If you're a fan of smooth ballads and relaxing slow jams, this is a must-have for your collection. I know downloading songs on to computers is a hip thing these days, but if you're still old school, and enjoy collecting CD's, this isn't a bad one to have. This has to rank as one of my top 10 favorite albums of all time!"
5,Loved it!,This movie is awesome for the art. The 'behind the scenes' is better than the movie but this movie is hot. The men are beautiful and there is a lot of nudity so it's at least worth a rental. Awesome. Check it out.
4,This is not an easy film to review,"I really enjoyed this film but part of the reason is that I was in Paris about the time that this film was set. I was therefore able to empathize with the weird clothes that the actors wore, the ancient cars, etc. I liked the way that the film jumped around from scene to scene with minimal links. So like life. I also liked the way that male sex was displayed without any sort of embarrassment or censorship. So unlike a US film. I am always amazed that US films will show the grossest and most horrific violence but once one gets to sex then it is censorship time. I am not a great fan of the French but some things they get just right."
2,"interesting, but not to die for","I whs hoping for something more interesting. It was hard to follow. It was more like a documentary, than a drama. Maybe i will have to watch it again to get the idea of it. Better luck next time."
2,Not as good as I thought...,"Great concept: protective rubber skin that protects the BlackBerry unit from accidental drops and scratches. The rubbery material tends to collect all sorts of dust and lint. It's very hard to get it off (unless you wash it with water or use tape to peel it off). The protective cover doesn't fit around the screen too well. Mine tends to be stretched out a little more on the left side than on the right (even if I try and reposition the unit itself). The plastic screen cover (that can be removed) was already scratched due to the way it is packaged. All in all, I am pretty disappointed... mainly because I paid over $33 for it. It's now sitting on my desk at work collecting dust."
3,Like putting on a girdle,"Having read some of the reviews posted, I wasn't expecting to be ""wow""-ed by this case. It's worse than I expected.It is a feat just to get the Blackberry inside this case. It took a coworker and I almost 15 minutes and it still isn't perfect.The provided holster is about half an inch shorter than the Blackberry. It has a tab on the top to hold it into the holster that I have not been able to work.We'll see how it goes. The tape trick works well to remove dust from the case. I was able to eventually get the plastic screen in place, but mine too is a little warped on the left side."
3,Clip Broke,"Great feel. Definitely confident that it protects the device, but really hard to get in and out of the provided clip. I had the thing for 2 months and the clip broke. Not sure what to do now as it cost over $30. Doubt I can still return it, and I'll probably have to pay more to get just the clip (if they even offer it)."
3,Just an Average Case,"The skin tight holder is a fairly good item, the rubber appears to be of high quality. It doesn't fit perfectly as the window around the screen becomes a little distorted, it doesn't stay in a perfect rectangular shape. Because of this the plastic screen that it comes with cannot stay in position. I tried the screen but gave up and don't use the screen. The ear hole is a little out of position as it doesn't show the speaker holes completely, but I haven't tried to listen to the phone without the case to see if it affects the sound. Above the top row of keys the case fits close and some with large thumbs may find that it gets in their way when using the top row of keys. The holster that comes with the case comes with a spring weaker than the original holster. As a result it doesn't clip on to the belt as securely as the original.Overall, it's not an excellent case but I use it because it offers good protection."
5,Essential element of Gulf War history.,"The important contribution of the Franch Army in the GulfWar has been largely overlooked in the English-speaking countries.Their ""left hook"" around Saddam's forces was a crucial elementin the strategy of his defeat. Perhaps more important forthe future, for the first time since World War Two, Frenchand American troops stood side by side against a commonenemy, rediscovering their common bonds and heritage in theprocess. Colonel Cooke, a French-fluent military intelligenceand armor officer who teaches Middle Eastern history incivilian life, was uniquely qualified for liason with the""Division Daguet"" (French 6th Light Armored Division),bringing to the task not only military expertise but asensitive and informed understanding of these highlycapable but prickly warriors. His book is an admirably clearand complete record of the Daguet operations, and has enoughcontext to serve as a good one-volume history of the overallland conflict as well. Highly recommended."
2,Low Volume,"This cassette adapter does not work well in the radio of my Dodge Caravan. The volume is very low. I went back to my old Sony adapter, which works much better."
2,The sound that grates,"This adaptor works, but, like another one I bought, makes a grinding sound as the wheels go round in my car tape deck. Regular tapes play fine so looks like a deficiency in the adapter."
3,bike review,The frame was bent and is not level. The bike itself is not as stable as I would have hoped.
4,Iwasthere,"FennFenn has it all wrong, I'm afraid....the tracks on this CD are not 'new' - but predsominantly alternate mixes and/or live recordings of the Shriekback Big Band of the mid-to-late '80s...when they were truly at their performing peak. If you saw them on tour in the USA in '85 either alone or with Simple Minds....you'll know exactly what I mean. This was not a 'thrown' together collection by any means and there are indeed a couple of re-recordings done by Barry Andrews - but lovingly and painstakingly done."
1,Bad remixes of good songs,"The original songs are good....no....great!The versions on ""The Dancing Years"" are bad.I'm not sure if there are even 'dancable'.Along with ""Go Bang"", a discerbable low pointin the history of Shriekback."
2,Not What You'd Expect,"These songs are new versions which sound nothing like what you remember from the 80's. When you open the jacket, there's a ""road map"" explaining where the old band members went. This is why the music bears little resemblance to the original tracks and is, in fact, quite inferior."
3,New Chicken Fat Video,"Was delighted to find this video, remember Chicken fat fondly from Junior High days, This is a great workout for those of you who tend not to want to give much time or commitment. I do it with my 10 year old son, lots of great cardio vascular excercise.Having said all that, wished you could hear more of the song, and while the video is billed as 26 minutes, there is only about 15 minutes of actual excercise, and that includes a cool-down mid-way. Still was a great help to my New Years resolution of doing some kind of activity everyday, and because it is quick, is easy to find time for."
1,Not worth the money,"My children (ages 5 and 8) found nothing worthwhile in this video. The quality is poor, the exercises and music are uninteresting. It's the video equivalent of an elementary school film strip."
2,How HOKEY!,"Oh, my gosh, this video is hokey! Then again, maybe that's what kids like. My 3-year-old watches half of it, then starts following along. They do prefer the ""Fit 4 Kids"" video, though, or even my ""Walk Away the Pounds"" DVD's. I have to wonder, too, if the makers assumed that moms were watching the video with the kids; I'd swear the guy in the movie stuffs his shorts, and it's very distracting!"
1,Waste of money,"I was very disappointed with both the content and quality of this video. The video contains only one song with numerous movements and bad camera angles. More time is spent introducing the kids exercising than working out. Unfortunately, I am unable to return it since I opened it."
5,OUTSTANDING FUN,My children and I love doing the exercise routine along with this video. I remember the song from my childhood when I did it in gymclass. It is the best exercise video I have ever seen (and I've seen many). It is a perfect way for children to learn the fun of exercise and I would recommend it to kids of all ages.
5,Outstanding,My children love this video. It is an excellent workout for both kids and adults. The kids learned about this at school and begged me to buy it for home. It was a great investment.
1,more talk than walk,"The video length was listed at approx. 25 mins, (it wasn't quite 22 mins long, including beginning and ending credits) and of that time only 13 mins was dedicated to the exercise routine. It says its for 2-12 year olds, but of my 2, 8, and 11 year old sons, only my 2 year old finished it, the other two went to their rooms bored. I can see it appealing to preschool to kindergartner age children, but not to school age kids."
2,No Show,I Purchased this from musicbuys in Nov. I still have not seen it.I dont know where it is or how to find out.B. Davis
2,Dissapointment,"I was looking forward to anakin in this package as well as the airborn trooper. To my dislike I found out that ankins figure was poorly made, his face is akward and the articulation is horrible. The only good side is the trooper which was ok, good articulated and looked great. In short, if u looking for the airborne trooper buy it now, but be awared that the other figured fails across the board"
5,Great Post-Apocalyptic Story!,"I would write a longee review if I had more time. But I thought this was a great anime filled with action, and quite a bit of comedy. The cast in the english dub is top notch also."
4,Great recording,Terific concert recording for any band. My original Japan vinyl pressing is typical of the high quality record pressing from Japan in the eighties. The Japanese attention to detail (exemplified by YMO itself) is missed today.
3,"My favorite YMO album, but...","I wish this release had the same tracks as the 2 LP vinyl version. (There are 2 CD versions out there, but they're obscenely expensive)The other quibble I have is the titles of tracks 14 and 15 are incorrect. ""Kageki Na Munekyun"" should read ""Kageki Na Syukujo"" and ""Uwaki Na Vacances"" should read ""Kimi Ni Munekyun (Uwaki Na Vacances)""."
1,ugh yuck,"nasty, vile, ugly, putrid like an infected wound. pornographic, insipid, perverse. it was disgusting in the 60s and remains so. it has no socially redeeming value whatsoever. if i could give -0- stars i would. or minus stars. use this book to start your next bonfire."
3,An excellent concept that suffers from printing problems.,"The Secret of Zir'an presents a unique and creative world full of action and adventure. Players who enjoy the idea of a high magic Indiana Jones campaign set in a world on the brink of war will love this setting. The system offers speedy task resolution and gives players opportunities to creatively contribute to the game beyond die results.Unfortunately, a printing problem and a few rules hiccups prevent this from being a perfect product."
3,It works...,"This gets a rating of 3 stars. I already had some previous NLP knowledge so the book didn't help me much. Its a good book to start off with if you are getting into NLP. The author does not cover some things...I felt shocked and out of place when I was in situations that needed olfactory and gustatory responses.So, buy this if you are barley starting NLP. Find another book if you already have some knowledge...Either way, rapport feels great when your on the same page with someone."
1,Completely unfounded,"This book has a few worthwile basic ideas, but those could be summarized on a cocktail napkin and do not necessitate an entire book. The majority of this book discusses how people are divided into three types - visual, auditory or kinesthetic - and how to appeal to or persuade to them accordingly given the language they understand. While ""see the world through your negotiating partner's eyes"" is a good concept to know, this book makes far-encompassing claims in unrealistic, idealistic scenarios, does not back up those claims with data, and assumes a stance of ""this is all you need to know to work magic in a negotiating situation or to get someone to really love you instantly based on communication.I hear Brooks is a communication scientist; I very much hope that his other books contain science to back themselves up, because this one sure doesn't. With some data, I would be more inclined to accept these far-reaching theories as credible - but only slightly."
2,Instantly getting someone to like you,"This book on tape was incredibly brief and I have already forgotten a lot about it. It went on talking about visual people and other kinds of people and then drawing from there in order to find how can we make someone connect with us. It does not take a rocket science to reproduce their analysis, but then why should you care to produce an 'instant' connection. Many times, it takes some time to like a person."
2,Reads like an infomercial,"This having been my first look at NLP, I can not comment on how this book compares to others in the field. The one thing that struck me over and over again is that the book could be reduced down to a pamphlet of 20 pages if you took out the success stories, restatements of previously covered material, and enthusiastic assurances that you'll wield the most powerful force on the planet as soon as you finish the next chapter. This book left me wanting more information, and an feeling like even this short book should have provided it."
2,Shallow,"For all the endorsements, you think there'd be more material than ""here are some good ideas on how to listen and communicate with others"". I was disappointed with this book. The author spends a lot of time trying to classify people into 3 different categories, and then trys to define how you can communicate with each category. He provides no DATA on to support this categorization, just ""hey this seems like a good idea"""
5,Great book!,This is by far my favorite book on NLP. The author makes it easy for the 1st time NLP'r to understand and it's great review for the advanced student of influence. I highly recommend that this book be added to your library.
3,Too drawn out,"Its not a bad book, I learned some useful information from it. However, as other reviewers have stated, this book could have been a pamphlet. Halfway through I was begging for the author to hurry up and stop wasting some many words re-explaining the same topics over and over and over again."
1,Author needs to read his own book,"Did anyone else read about Mr. Brooks saying ""Who the f--- do you think you are?"" to a flight attendant in an altercation that resulted in the plane having to make an unscheduled landing? (as reported in Newsweek magazine). So much for THIS guy's credibility!"
1,"about as scientific as astrology, and probably more stupid",Almost completely baseless and filled with laughable examples designed for grade schoolers. There are much better books around that tackle the subject far more effectively. stay away
2,Only a Very Minor Delve into the Topic,"Instant Rapport offers a light overview of some theoretical manners of relating to people that provides little overall content and nothing new or profound. Because Brooks broaches the subject of building rapport and overviews some key factors, this book is not completely without value. However, there are far better books available on the topic and a good start would be How to Win Friends and Influence People or any number of sales books.Building rapport with people and identifying human traits and causes that affect human interaction is not an overly difficult science, but it is vast and this book merely touches the tip of the iceberg."
1,No Useful Information,"This book was a total waste of money. It doesn't give any real solid ways to help improve communication, and it's not even interesting to read."
1,Just a Bunch of Copied Tricks,"Believe it or not : the first half of the book deals with ""representational systems"" alone. The next half elaborates on ""strategies"". In every chapter the author promises you heaven and ultimately dishes out a picture of it! The author just seemed to read Tony Robbins' ""Unlimited Power"" and copied its contents. I would rather recommend ""Unlimited Power"". Atleast Tony appears sincere! Defintely not for anyone with atleast some knowledge of NLP. For beginners : Go through some of the articles online about NLP (Those by Robert Dilts', for example. You will get much better information that way."
2,Could Have Been A ... Three,"Three stars, I mean, of course. This one has one decent ballad in its first track ""This Could Be The Right One"" which is sappy enough and cynical enough not to be a complete waste... an ok song, overall. But for me this is an album of ""Gimme That Thing Called Love"" - that's a great hard-rock song with catchy tune, great drive and it definitely goes to my hit list. Rock on! As for the main question on your mind - do I buy this piece of silicon or not.. c'mon tell me man! I am counting on ya!! I beg you... well probably the answer is no. This is too generic. I am not saying it's not a good listen... it's getting a B from me but you can build a tower of Babel from B-records issued just in the last 24 hours and then had left some enough to give everybody in China coasters for their teacups. Life is too short to listen to all B-records out there so my advice is this - buy tracks 1 and 7 somewhere (iTunes, Napster or ...) and move on."
3,cheaper than the custom edition my school decided we need,"i hate how the schools rip us off with custom editions, they just take away a couple of chapters and charge us for a new book that is harder to buy and sell used. this book is easy to read. a bit boring to read. not many color pics. the teacher used it slightly."
3,"Good price, old book","This book had a decent price, but was quite worn and had a lot of underlining in it."
4,More Dependable than Timex,"This is one of the best heavy equipment/demolition tools I've ever used on the job. A few months back I needed to rent one for some work I was doing on my basement, breaking up old concrete. After I used it for a couple of days, I went out and bought one for work (I'm a demolition contractor). This is much easier to control than most 60-90lb pneumatic jack hammers. I'm not a very muscular person, but I didn't have any difficulty handling it and it never walked on me. If you need a medium to heavy duty jack hammer, I'd recommend purchasing or renting this over most pneumatic hammers because it's easy to use, it's reliable, the steel bits it uses are widely available and you don't have to lug around a huge compressor."
4,Good uncluttered design.,"The watch design is fairly simple, and to me, elegant. No frills (alarms, etc. but since cell phones can do all these things very well these days there is no need to clutter your watch). The watch seems to keep time well, though I haven't tested it to the second.Night vision is excellent with back light (even without the hands are phosphorescent). On the other hand, the digits are white on white, so in daylight it is not the easiest to read."
3,nice watch; one problem,"the winding stem is not very secure. sometimes it pops out and the watch stops. The strap also takes a little maneuvering to get it off. It's a good watch for casual dress, summer weather, etc."
5,Aquarium Pharmaceuticals 79C Ammo-Chips Ammonia Removing Resin for Fresh Wate,"Aquarium Pharmaceuticals 79C Ammo-Chips Ammonia Removing Resin for Fresh Water Aquarium, Half-Gallon Box good product, good price and good service."
5,its charcoal,what can i say it is charcoal to keep my fish tank clean and clear. The price was right. Will i order again ? yes as long as i have other items to get free shipping. My tank is crystal clear after using this product.
4,Wonderful Book for Introducing Animals!,"I got this book for my 15-month-old twins, thinking that I'd like to begin introducing them to Spanish words at the same time they were learning English words. I don't use the Spanish much right now, but it has been a fantastic book for teaching my kids about animals! There is so much variety, so they don't get bored like they do with some other books that have just four or five animals. Both of them can pick out emus, flamingos, starfish, crabs, bison, and a host of other animals that they wouldn't see in most other children's books. It has been great for their creativity too - I have acted out the sound and/or movement for many of these animals, and they, in turn, ""read"" the book themselves and act out all of these animal noises and movements! I think I would be just as happy with the English version, but why not go ahead and get the bi-lingual version for an extra learning opportunity!?"
4,Good little book,"Great starter book for the price.If you are at the point of ""thinking about getting it""... then get it.It should not disappoint. Good translations and simple.Like to keep my reviews short and to the point.Cheers"
3,music not what i expected,the service was terrific- music was not what i expected - had more instrumental then singing; but all in all it was entertaining.
5,Who Thought It Could Be This Easy?,"In her latest book, Vision with a Capital V, Joanne Victoria has forged a path for readers to create and live their own vision with an easy, step-by-step plan. This book will take you on a valuable, powerful venture that will allow you to conquer your limitations and live your vision with verve, veracity, and victory...all with a capital V!"
2,Not Luxurious enough,"My mistake. It takes a long time to heat up. When it finally does heat up it is too hot. The tub is smaller than I thought. It's okay, but would've bought a bigger one, where the wax melted, but not steaming.Maybe they could use these comments for the next model."
5,Revlon MoistureStay Paraffin Bath - Great Item,I love this paraffin bath. It feels great & is very soothing. It really helps ease the arthritic pains in my hand. The lavender/eucalyptus paraffin leaves a wonderful aroma throughout my home. I use it a couple of times a week. I highly recommend the Revlon MoistureStay Parafin Bath.
1,Revlon Moisturestay Paraffin Bath,"The heat dial does not work and since my husband threw out the box, I cannot return it. A complete waste of money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Therapeutic Paraffin Bath,"After a few uses, I regained mobility in my fingers and am able to do the exercises recommended by the O.T. When I feel stiff, I go and dip my hand ten times and immediately feel relief!"
4,can't open plastic gloves,"The machine itself is great, but the plastic gloves are IMPOSSIBLE to open. I have tried many times and different ways all for naught.REVLON MoistureStay Fast Heat Up Luxury Paraffin Bath RVS1212"
5,"Excellent paraffin bath, good value","I'm getting up in years, so the aches and pains are multiplying. Paraffin baths are excellent for creaky hands. Just dip your hands until you have a nice thick glove (I like about 12 layers), put on the plastic mitt and then the terrycloth mitt, then go park somewhere for 15 minutes. I use it 2-3 times per week and it really makes a difference. The fast-heat setting is great, it's ready in about 90 minutes.The paraffin is a good moisturizer so you get a double benefit. It's large enough for my feet, but I think if I ever want to wax my feet I'm going to get a separate unit.Plain old paraffin from the grocery store works fine. I like the lavender-scented blocks that come with it."
3,hot stuff,this works great... the heat up is not that fast...but it holds the heat...i use it for the treatment of a trigger finger....I recycle the wax even though told to discard...it has multi settings that are useful at a moderate price...
4,Yup need a Prince,"Yes, all the princess need a prince to fight over. We had a blonde to do the honors but the girls are much happier having 2 competing males to do the honors. His clothes are easy to get on and he is as dashing as they come. Need to find one more less european prince to finish the collection."
1,A waste of time,"I looked forward to reading A Family Daughter because I thought it would be a continuation of the Santerres family saga. I'd liked the first book, Liars and Saints, very much. It came as quite a surprise to find the book was a rehash of the first book with changes in the story. This book became the 'true' story while the first book became the book that the main character, Abby, wrote. The biggest problem for me was that this 'true' story was far more unbelievable than the first book. While Liars and Saints seemed a bit unreal, this one was totally convuluted. I pushed myself to read the entire thing, but found it hard going. I wanted to see if there was any redeeming qualities to the book, but I found none. The only satisfying thing about the end of the book was that it was THE END!"
3,It was hard to know what to expect,This book was a decent book. It got to the point and went through things quick. Then about half way through things started slowing down and I couldn't help but wonder where the heck it was going it picked itself back up toward the 3/4 point and ended pretty decent.
2,ridiculous,Although Liars and Saints had a few flaws it was truelly enjoyable fiction but I agree that this book goes way off into chaos in the second half. Also the fact that the sequel doesn't parralel the first story and then pick -up left me scratching my head. Why rewrite the first book when the first book worked? Carry on with the second
4,Meloy - Second Take on a Family,"We return to the family of her first book. Some things are explained, some things are added, but the second look lacks the freshness of the first. A good book, but let's have a new family for the third."
1,Garbage. One star is a thousand too many.,"I have read none of the author's previous work. I can find no redemptive value in this book; the characters are not developed, the dialogue feels ridiculous, and situations which require examination, insight, and depth have none. I am having a hard time describing just how bad this book was. Ugh."
3,Disappointing,"This book was too much like her first one before this. In fact, there were some discrepancies in this that didn't go along with the prequel. I didn't hardly get into it, when i decided not to read anymore."
2,i was disappointed with A Family Daughter!,"The reviews on this book were so positive that i was so looking forward to reading A Family Daughter. But, i was nothing short of disappointed... the first half kept me going, but the second half was silly and uninteresting. In a nutshell... don't waste your valuable reading time with this novel- it is sure to be flat and forgettable!"
2,Far Fetched,"I finished this book, but only so I could move on to another. While I like the author's prose, I found the story line to be a bit far fetched, and predictable. There's better fiction out there."
1,"I rarely give up halfway through a book, but...","The author sets up a somewhat interesting universe and sketches out some nice basic story ideas and characters, but then fails to ever mention them again or develop any of them in any way. Gay sci-fi is definitely somewhat of a specialty niche, so I'm more than willing to make allowances, but this book was simply one erotic encounter after another with no regard to establishing any kind of overarching story or theme. Don't get me wrong, even that might not have been so bad if it weren't for the obnoxious and arrogant way the main character is written. You're more likely to want to slap him than sleep with him. If you're a misanthropic, gay, IT geek with a chip on your shoulder, you might enjoy this book. Otherwise, I'd get something else."
2,Not The Same,I've ordered this before and it came with gray legs and my cats adored it! They would play with it and try to run away with it. Eventually they tore the legs off it but it took months for that to happen and they still like to bat the body around. I ordered 2 replacements and they are not the same. The body is all black and my kitties ripped the legs in 10 minutes on the first one and tore the body completely off the cord in an hour with the second one. I don't know what they changed but please change it back! I have to find my boys a new favorite toy. :)
2,"Love this line, this design is not good","I love this product, but this particular one (The Octopus) is very flimsy and poorly made. My cat bever wanted to play with it, and yet it still was torn right away."
5,Flex ratchet wrenches,I bought two sets of these for myself and my brother to work on our cars together. They get into tight places really quickly and are way better than regular combination wrenches or even the non-flex ratchet wrenches. The short rotation is brilliant and saves your knuckles from being skinned. Good for bicycles too we discovered. Quality seems excellent thus far and the warranty is encouraging.
5,Every Women must read this book,"This book was so wonderful. Every women in the country should read this book. It make me take a closer look at how I view myself and those around me. I, to, am disfigured with scars on my arms and chest. This book made me look this and see the real me."
2,Want to read the Afterword? Don't buy Kindle version!,"After reading the review of this book, I decided to buy, especially since Grealy's friend, Ann Patchett, wrote the afterword and is one of my favorite authors. Since I don't have much on my Kindle right now, I chose the Kindle version. Lo and behold -- the afterword is not included in the Kindle version. Now that I look back and see the ever-so-slight different in advertising, I see that the paperback version mentions the afterword where the Kindle version does not, but most readers aren't going to see that difference. I'm an editor, and I didn't. BIG FAIL, Amazon. If there's going to be a dramatic difference between the Kindle version and the paperback, you should tell readers. I would have gladly paid 46 cents more and waited two days for the paperback, had I known. It's bad enough to put up with all the typos in the Kindle versions."
4,Humor in dark places,"Lucy Grealy said it best herself when fans asked her how she remembered everything in such detail. She said, ""I didn't remember it. I wrote it."" And the result is beautiful, haunting and oddly funny. Grealy delves into the dark with such wit that even descriptions of chemo-induced vomiting and the cruelties of adolescent boys become bearable. The great tragedy is that we lost her so soon..."
3,Too depressing,I thought I'd read this after my jaw was removed because of a tumor. Just depressed me even more because the author had it even worse than I did. Want to suffer more than you thought you have? Then read this. Suffered enough? Go out and enjoy the sunshine instead.
5,A Must-Read for the Outsider in All of Us,"This book is FABULOUS. Anyone who has ever felt like an outsider should read it (Now, that should be everyone)."
2,selfish girl,"As seen in Truth & Beauty by Ann Patchett, Lucy Grealy is a selfish spoiled girl. Her main concern in this book is not how to live with the disfigurement from cancer, but how to make people do things to make her happy. She learns to work the system to get what she wants. There's no great introspection in her story. She has no startling insights about life. She just goes along from surgery to surgery begging for attention and love while not giving anything back to others. The most interesting thing in the book was the mention of early drug abuse with painkillers from surgery and how she dismissed it as nothing important.And I also noticed how she never mentioned Ann Patchett in this book. If Ann was such a wonderful friend and the only person to understand Lucy, why did she not appear in this story? Many other people are included, from her first lover to her horse's caretaker. It's fascinating to see how life and memories are rewritten after the fact."
3,"Often disturbing, yet inspiring read","This book was quite disturbing to me, yet I have to say it was well written, I had a hard time putting it down, despite the discomfort it produced, and it inspired me greatly. The content was difficult...the mere thought of a child so young having to go through such an experience was hard for me to read, yet her style was wonderful....and I found myself cheering her on. I can't imagine the emotional pain, not to mention the physical pain she has experienced in her life and it's interesting to see what such pain will do to a person's personality and spirit."
4,Hauntingly hard to read,"I had no idea what I was getting myself into when I picked this book up. I knew it was an autobiography and that was about it. I knew from the picture on the back of the book that the author had lost a portion of her jaw. I had no idea what an impact the book would have on me.Words cannot describe the power of this book. Many parts were hard for me to read, especially the parts about her reaction to chemotherapy as my mother had undergone chemo and I had no idea how she did it. It is amazing to me that someone can have such a cynical and yet sometimes hilarious outlook on life and human behavior. In the end, it was certainly a roller coaster emotional ride that I'm glad I went on. For better or worse, I now see the world through slightly different eyes."
4,Great book,I think this is a great book. No wonder it has been adopted by so many high schools. The way Ms.Grealy wrote the book it seems as if you want to be going through the same thing she does. It makes me just want to comfort her because of all the pain and sadness she went through.I think this one of the best books ever written.
3,Autobiography of a face,"Autobiography of a face is a true story about Lucy Grealy, the author. She tells her story of having cancer and how she had to live with a distorted self-image for more than twenty years and have over thirty reconstructive surgeries before she could come to terms with herself. She developed a fear of never being loved at some point but gratefully she learned to define herself from inside out. She realizes that beauty is found deep within.I felt this was a very easy book to read. The language wasn't too big and it was easy to follow. If you like true stories about real people then you will like this book. Lucy Grealy is a very good writer. I feel she is a very strong person for not giving up on herself and I'm glad she made something of her life. I really liked this book."
1,tell me something i didnt learn in chapter 1,"While Grealy showed superior grammar and vocabulary in this book, she lacked a positive attitude. I found this book extremely sorrowful and drowning in self-pity. I dont mean to sound harsh, and I am very grateful that I have not contracted this disease, but I found it rather pig-headed of her to write with such detail about her appearance when she had a 5% chance of living with this disease- and she lived. I took no pleasure in reading something 240 pages long that talked only about how ugly she was and how terrible her life was, because in all honesty, things could have been a lot worse."
4,You must see the butterfly needle...,"Superbly written, Ms. Grealy's book does not spare us the rawness of her struggles, both in the descriptions of the medical procedures and the recountings of the taunts and jeers of her male peers.At times I felt Lucy had the same condescension for the reader as she had for her jeering peers. She pulled us in so that we had sympathy no matter how much her words and tone insisted she did not want sympathy. Then she would abruptly turn and show us the ugliness of disease, as if to say, ""Here, you will look. I will not let you turn away.""Particularly jarring was the chapter ironically entitled ""The Petting Zoo."" A visit to the animal research lab gives us a literal and metaphorical glimpse of the truths a very young Lucy had to face.I could not find Lucy lovable, but I was awed by her tremendous courage and her poignant humanity. I was glad she did not let us turn away."
4,Pretty Good Book with a Great Lesson,"This Book shows how hard it is to overcome such a horrible thing as having cancer. My only bad comment for this book is that it gets annoying at times that the author seems to have a bit of an ego, however, she's been through a lot so its understandable. Lucy Grealy had cancer in her face that eventually led to having half of her chin removed. The reader feels the horror of the pain that she had to go through, especially in chemotherapy. In addition, Lucy had to face the rudeness and ignorance of other people. This book is very touching, and very interesting."
4,Excellent,"This book is not maudlin or sentimental. It's a memoir, which I'm not a big fan of, but it was well-written, interesting and just an easy, intelligent book."
4,seems odd,"i found the book very well written, but very, very sad. it seemed weird to me, when searching through the reviews, that most everyone discusses her as if she's alive, unfortunately she no longer is. i feel that that part is inextricable from the rest of the story and its message. this is not a story about a woman who overcame cancer and her feelings of insecurities, it is a story of a person who, after undergoing grueling treatments may have conquered the physical illness, but never its emotional consequences.it garnered a lot of sympathy and empathy from me.i felt so sad for her and wished that she had joined support groups, seen a good therapist, and had had a better support system to start out with.shame that the world has lost her."
5,The most beautiful prose and the most moving story,"This book did me in. I absolutely loved ever word. Lucy Grealy's prose is hauntingly beautiful. And her story is purely haunting, especially since her death, which sounds like it was a suicide. It is at once a deeply sad and profoundly hopeful book, full of wisdom and insight. As a reader who has dealt with a disabling chronic illness for the last 13 years, I felt ""responance"" with this book in a way that I have with no other book before or since."
4,Great Night Time Listening,"This is probably the darkest album Ryan Adams has made to date and definitely the most well produced. Nothing is happy or rocking here; it's an album you want to give your undivided attention to in order to fully appreciate. It's not unlike Heartbreaker only with a thicker more polished sound. I would also equate it somewhat to Big Star's Third. If you love that, you will at least like this too."
4,Strikingly solid,"An album I found myself surprised appreciating. Some of the songwriting is not spectacularly original, but Adams exudes charisma and helps personify a great deal of this diverse session. What strikes me is the range of vocals he employs throughout the disc, dabbling in many of rock's sub-genres and channeling their masters with absolute ease. The title track never stopped effecting from my first encounter with that chorus."
4,"""Love Is Hell"" is heaven.","I feel pretty lucky to have gotten this album. Not just because I didn't buy the two previous EP's of it, but because this is wonderful music. Another thing I like about it, is that it's a bit more upbeat and consistent than ""Heartbreaker"", but not as alt-rocky as ""Rock N' Roll"" was. It's a really pleasing middle ground between the two, and is now easily my favorite album of his. Like many people, I was drawn to this by the cover of ""Wonderwall"", but that is truly an average song on a much above average album. In fact I'm not even going to mention the other tracks because they're all so strong. Highly recommended."
5,Love is Hell Part 1,"I only have heard Part 1 of love is hell. It was given to me by my sister because she thought i might like it and I am astonished. I never heard Ryan Adams until this CD. ""The Shadowlands"" is probly the most emotional song Ive ever heard. I love Ryan Adams cause you can really hear what he's trying to say in his voice. Lyrics aside, the tone of his voice would be enough to show the emotion.Im really trying to get into some good music now that im getting older and I think Ryan Adams will be a staple in my music listen for years to come. Great songwriter! Now i just have to buy the rest of his cds!"
3,Tweener,"This sounds like a precursor to Ryan Adams' late 2005 release, ""29"" in many ways. I don't particularly enjoy ""29,"" which I categorize as keening and noodling. This album only partially goes in that direction, and is still worth having for tracks like ""Anybody Wanna...,"" ""WW 24,"" and ""Hotel Chelsea Nights."" It's a pretty fair mix of what he's been doing since 2003; would get four stars except for a handful of songs like ""Thank You Louise"" which I have tried a few times to get through and just can't."
1,Bitter music fan,"I've been a fan of Ryan Adams because of Whiskeytown but hadn't bought his solo stuff until the Love Is Hell EPs. Now his label gives the finger to fans by combining the EPs into an LP with a bonus track. That's crap. Although I'm morally opposed to burning CDs, I also hold grudges. So, from now on, any CDs I want from Ryan Adams or Lost Highway, I'm burning them, not buying them. I encourage everyone else to do the same."
4,Disco Queen,This CD is a fabulous bunch of dance songs. With techno and American influence you'll be dancing the night away. It's also a great CD for working out or when you need a little extra umph or energy. Overall a great mix!
1,Hilarious!!!,"I have spent about 20 minutes listening to all the snippets of these "" Tribute"" albums. At first I thought there was no way any of this albums could beat the pure ridiculousness of the Michael Jackson tribute album. Boy, was I wrong. They had to make the mistake of messing with my favorite group's songs. The clip on here for ""Come on Down"" actually isn't half bad. But listen to Baby, baby, baby and this fool doesn't even know the words! He's on here mumbling like a drunken idiot at a kareoke bar! Get it for sheer laughs ONLY. Wow...Big Eye Records should be punished, severely."
1,They just murdered EVERY song they remade!,"Ok, If you know how the real TLC sounds, why would you even make a cd that sounds that bad as a tribute? TLC is the best female group out there (and the sales records show it) and these are the worst singers out there... I am sorry for anyone who will or have spent money on this.. I am glad I didnt buy it... If you think this one is bad dont even listen to the Aaliyah or Janet Jackson ones... I feel bad that they used TLC songs. I am a huge fan of theirs and I am embarrassed for them! My heart also goes out to them for the loss of fellow group mate Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes.. We love you girl and we know your up there smiling down on us! RIP. TLC IS FOREVER! I'm out."
1,What the Heck?,"Well, this CD is crap. Monica sings in it and I found out that the girl who sounds like a boy is RuPaul. Those are the only people I know who sings on here. Why RuPaul? and Why such Bad Quality? Instead of going all out they had to half a$$ it."
1,Poor excuse to make some money,"What ... is this!???!!! They call this a tribute to TLC?!!! No. 1, the vocals are terrible. I can't even tell whether it's a man or a woman trying to imitate T-Boz's voice. The rapping [is awful]. Is this tribute even authorized by the songwriters and artist and how could they allow such untalented people who will never get anywhere in the music industry to perform the songs? No. No. No. ... Let's put them out of their miseries. They're not singing. They're actually screaming out for us to put them out of their misery. I WARN YOU. DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM. ..."
1,0 Stars for the No.1 insult in the world,I really have nothing to say on this because Its' just an insult to the NO.1 girl group naw Group period and they gonna F this up All I gotta say is this no real TLC fan would buy this rip-off garbage tell our friends about this horrid trash
1,god of war,This game did not work and it is supposed to be for a ps2 then they claim it doesnt work for a ps2 slim and are a bunch of crap
2,Very Glitchy,I don't know about anyone else. But I came across this huge glitch when fighting the barbarian king. It came out to a green swamp-like background and I couldn't even see Kratos or the Barbarian King. So that pretty much meant death for me. Evey time I play its the same situation. But the beginning plot isn't too bad.
1,Don't Buy from Warehouse Deals,"Upon receiving & opening my game, I discovered that only 1 of 2 discs were in the case.. The Game disc was missing and only the Special Features disc was included. Alas, I didn't even get to play the game. I know the actual game is fantastic, I loved the first God of War game.My rating is based on how I received the order.. I will have to purchase the game from somewhere else.... Sad face! :(But hey, at least I got my money back. Cheers to that!!"
4,Impressive follow-up,"I just finished the game. It took about 19 hrs total. This one is every bit as good as GOW1 in the graphics department, but story is nowhere near as good. I give it 4 stars only because its predecessor was better in my opinion. Still a great game."
2,"Frustration, Dying and more Dying","SECA should be ashamed of themselves for subjecting people to this button mashing game. I spent a great deal of time trying to like the game, but in the end I just got too tired of having the game ignore my moves, spending 20 minutes trying to make just that perfect jump-jump-grab-grab-hit ect ect combo to milisecond timing required by the programmers. They even keep statistics on how many times they kill you.Save your time, money and peace of mind and avoid this game like the plague."
5,one word - EPIC,"If you haven't played GoW 2 chances are you haven't played the first one either, since most people who've played the first follow the entire series. So my advice if you are thinking about buying this game is as many already know buy the collection if you own a ps3. Both GoW games are great, but the second one is the best one. GoW felt liked an unfinished game and Gow 2 seems like what the developers truly wanted. one of my favorite gaming experience of all time."
3,Lets try something new,"I am a fan of the first GoW. I loved the how brutal everything was. The sheer power of the presentation alone captivated me enough to play for hours on end. I simply didn't have that feeling this time around. There have been many improvements in this installment, and they are apparent right off the bat. After about three hours of play, I grew bored. This game is simply missing the wow factor of the first one. Don't get me wrong, this game is good. I was looking for something a little more."
5,Ready for more awsome.,"I haven't even begun to play this game yet as I haven't finished the first one, but if the first one is anything to go by (which I hear it is) then this game will be an amazing sequel."
5,GOOD GAME,"This game is a lot of action and has superior graphics to the previous version.Is not for children, it is very bloody, has sex scenes and strong language."
5,Amazing,"I loved this game! What can I say? It is the second in the series of God Of War. It is twice as cool as the first, and I loved the first. It sets up the third installment as you finnish this game. And I can't wait until the 3rd installment comes out. I won't give anything away, but I can say that not even the God's can stop the will of Kratos!(The main charactor)Get this game, but I highly suggest that you play the first game first."
5,OUTSTANDING!,"I absolutely loved the first game so when I heard this was coming, I knew it'd be great. I wasn't wrong. Graphics, scenery, mythology, brutality, moves and magic...it's got it all. God of War I & II are the type of game I play over and over. In my opinion, it doesn't get better. Now I'm ready for part 3!"
5,EPIC!!!,"Halfway through the GOW II and I'm in a rush to review it!? This has never happened before and I think it won't happen again.This game is well worth its $50 and even the price of any XBOX 360 or PS3 game.It's just an epos of grandiose mythology based storyline, frenetic bloody action paused by smartly crafted puzzles, high class fantasy art design and a magnificent musical score that will give you goose bumps!If you are a parent DO NOT buy it for your kids though!!! It's a very involving masterpiece that could have a high impact on young souls that are still in search of their own path in life.*****"
5,Believe the hype.,"If you like the first one, you'll love this one. Top notch production value and great game play. Probably the best game of its genre."
5,If you enjoyed God of War......,"Then this game is for you! Excellent Graphics, more cool weapons and tons of blood ;) So far, I am having a blast! I may have to get a PS3 for GOW III."
4,Bring on the Pain,"God of War II is a great sequel. It has an interesting story with great scenes. Despite it being on the PS2, it plays great on the PS3, cutting the load times, etc. And for a PS2 game, it has spectacular views, effects, etc.The game is a mix of battles, puzzles, and mini-games. It is challenging trying to figure out the problem, or trying to get special items. To take down certain enemies it sometimes utilizes a mini-game to accomplish the feat.Only seldom is the lack of camera control a problem. Mostly this occurs when a large enemy blocks your view of Kratos, making it hard to see what you're doing.There are many different elements to this game, making it very enjoyable for repeat plays. Sometimes I find myself going back to see if I can defeat a boss/puzzle quicker."
5,The PS2 is not done yet,"While a lot of people already have next generation systems you should not pass this up over another next gen game. This game is brilliant, I dare say the best that has come out for the PS2. The gameplay is engaging and addictive, and the graphics are beautiful. Any fan of God of War must play GOW 2. It somehow tops one of the most amazing games of all time. If you haven't played God of War, play it first. But seriously buy GOW 2, play it, enjoy it, and savor the last gem of the PS2."
3,Good Job,"It was no as fun as the 1ST one.. Big Z is hard to beat.. But its sweet to try, try, & finally beat him down.. I'm waiting on the PsP game.."
1,i can['t tell............,i tried to play this game on my playstation 2 and it wouldn't play. i contacted the manufacturer and they weren't much help......... so i don't know if this game is any fun or not........
5,pure dopeness,this game is the best way to send the playstation 2 into retirement!!!! Kinda like Jordan...on top!!!!!
5,GOW 2,"This game is a more than worthy follow up to GOW 1, I have thoroughly enjoyed this game and I'm looking forward to purchasing a PS3 to play the next installment in this series."
4,Beautiful Brutality,"Much anticipated after the release of GoW I. GoW II is a must have addition to the medevil mayhem. I gave it an overall 4 instead of a 5 simply because the kills although they were new and graphic, they became redundant after the 3rd time seeing them (you can just imagine what it was like seeing it for the 147th time). Never the less this was a great game well worth the time and effort spent playing. Saddly it was entirely too short."
5,Absolutely amazing!!!!!!,I just couldn't put this game down. Once I started playing it there was no getting me off the couch. Overall game content was awesome. Controls were flawless and story line was even better than the first one. Combat pretty much remains the same but that's to be expected. This game was just too good. I am definitely looking forward to the next one. You'll be happy you bought this game.
4,A very fun and hard game: A-,This game is fun everthough it is kinda hard at times but I'll still say this is one of the best game on the PS2.
5,One of the few games that its better than its predecessor without really changing anything,"I really enjoyed this game. When I played the first game I thought that everything was well enough except for one thing which was the short list of boss fights (but the ones that were in the game were very enjoyable). This game has a more complex plot, more types of enemies, more puzzles, and also more boss fights, just not the way I had in mind. It has like four times the amount of boss fights but only a fraction of those have the dimensions in size of the first game. The only flaw I see to an otherwise very good game. I can't wait for the GOW III."
4,A very usefull and interesting book,A very nice book that compliments others in this field. It provides very usefull detailWell worth having as part of the collection.Clearly a knowledgable author
3,OK price for amateur sound,"While Scott can play guitar better than I can, much of his guitar playing sounds very similar to my amateur attempts in playing something that sounds like a song. I paid a low price for his CD so I don't feel bad about buying it. I actually commend Scott for being able to market a CD that sounds like he recorded some practice sessions. I was mostly disappointed that the 'songs' sounded more like jazz guitar than blues guitar. I was hoping to get more blues guitar ideas."
4,Solo Electric Blues Guitar,"You can tell this guy knows his guitar picking! The titles encourage you to use your creative imagination then....the music lets you lay back, relax and ENJOY! I most enjoyed the creativity of this artist as well as the song titles. Fun!"
4,Great Show,This show cracks me up. It's to bad it only lasted 1 season. The characters are great and very original.
5,My New Favorite Show !!,"It's absolutely hysterical, nothing like it on TV. The best new comedy on TV. I'll be heartbroken if they cancel the show."
2,Wanted to love this show!,"BUT I didn't. I saw the previews and really thought this could be one of the funniest new shows of the season. I love Molly Shannon and have always enjoyed her work but this just didn't do it for me. I was really disappointed. It was barely funny and Selma Blair spends most of the pilot scowling and making faces to show her disgust for just about everything around her. I know her spoiled brat character is supposed to be funny but I just found her really annoying. I'll have to watch another episode or two to see if it improves but if it's more of this, that will be one less new show I have to watch."
1,Watch the Original,I made it through about ten minutes of the American version. Kim actually caring about Kath? That was enough. Do as I did and get yourself a region-free dvd player and watch the original Kath and Kim. In researching a region free player you wouldn't believe the reviews I ran across from people who bought theirs just to watch the REAL Kath and Kim.
4,"BRILLIANT, UNDERRATED SHOW","They really should have named this show something else so people would not compare it to the AU version. The show should be judged for what it is (or was) and not compared to the other one. Having said that... This show is freakin' hilarious and full of sharp wit. I have to rewind parts sometimes to catch certain things. The show constantly makes fun of itself and is unashamedly campy. Molly Shannon and Selma Blair have great chemistry, and John Michael Higgins as Phil has some of the best lines EVER. Anyway, this show is extremely under-rated and under-appreciated. I guess if you don't ""get it"" you just don't get it. Too bad.By the way, I have never seen the Aussie version but really want to."
4,Pales in comparison to the Aussie version,"Why is it that Americans need everything americanised so they can digest it? In the process they end up ripping out the heart and soul of the original show. Do American's struggle to comprehend foreign humour? I hope not. Please America open your minds to something outside your world & embrace foreign content. First we had the great british series ""The Office"" given the american treatment and now the Aussie series ""Kath & Kim"". The original series are much better. What next??? An american version of Fawlty Towers because americans don't get it? What would be their chances on improving on that?"
5,A worthy sequel,"I enjoyed this book just as much as the first one, if not more. Macro and Cato are a little more comfortable with each other now, and that makes the story flow more smoothly. Highly recommended."
4,2nd Part,"Continuing the tails of Roman soldiers Cato and Macro, this is the 2nd part of the Roman invasion of Britain. While there is not a whole lot of written or even known history of the actual invasion Simon Scarrow is a historian and very well informed on the era. The stuff he adds does not feel out of place or implausible in any way. Though it is self contained in many ways I would recommend reading the first book. Also to be noted is that there are many follow up books in the Eagle series. Scarrow writes well and I think he has improved from the first book to the second. The only thing I didn't like was the ending felt a bit rushed. A whole lot of stuff happens in the last few pages which I think could have been expanded upon a bit. Other than that it is a fine book an a good series that I will continue reading."
3,Slow and at some times just boring.,I found this book to be rather boring. For excellent reading about the history of Rome try Bernard Cornwelll and Conn Igggulden. As I have read almost every book about the Roman empire I may be a little critical but for excellent accounts and events of the rise and fall of Rome read series of the mentioned authors.They do not disappoint.
1,Kindle version too hard to read.,"This is the second time that I have had cause to put aside a Kindle e-book due to very poor formatting. The book seems to be right up to Scarrow's normal standards, however, page after page of poor layouts, some with only nine or ten lines of prose & others divided into meaningless paragraphs made this book unreadable for me in the Kindle version."
4,Roman invasion novels,"I was always interested in Roman history, and the Simon Scarrow novels have really brought history to life for me, The characters are genuine, the dialogue flows well, and the whole nove fits very comfortably within the events that actually took place. The stories are written in such a way that the reader gains real sympathy for the legionaries and their foes amid the horrors of the Roman battlefield : I felt a visceral reaction to the description of some of the battles. This series of novels is a real find if you're a history / action buff !"
1,"Oh, ye gods! Have mercy!!","Honestly, I really tried to enjoy Scarrow's books, as I read all the works of historical fiction that's out there. But the Eagle series is just so utterly boring, an insult to the reader's intelligence. There is absolutely no historical detail at all. The characters are straight from Asterix the Gaul. I'm ahead of the reviews, because I've read the third book -not because I enjoy it, I reveiw historical fiction for a book store- and it's just as bland. It's a travesty to read the reviews Scarrow gets, when there is so much more better works out there. Attractive cover art is an enormous facter in book marketing. This whole series is a skeleton surrounded by an Armani suit."
1,Trash,"This book is bad. After reading well-developed stories about the ancient world written by Bernard Cornwell, Pressfield, Paxson, Whyte, it is impossible to accept this forced story. After reading the first two chapters I threw this book down disgusted by the shallow characters, weak plot, and awkward prose. If you want a copy of this book you can have mine that I left at the Sheraton in Denver, plugging up the toilet."
3,entertaining political thriller,"After absolutely loving the third book Robert Ellis wrote, City of Fire, and loving his second book, The Dead Room, I finally read his debut mystery, Access to Power. While Access to Power is an entertaining political thriller, it lacks the depth of his later works. Granted, it's ten years old, and it's about political corruption and campaigning, so perhaps it's unfair to judge the book by modern standards.If you're a fan of politics and mysteries, it's worth a read, but you must promise to read City of Fire (and it's sequel The Lost Witness) too."
4,Access to Power Review,"Robert Ellis writes interesting crime mysteries. This one deals with a political ads specialist and corrupt candidates. I feel this is one of those books that once you get started reading it, it's hard to put down until it's finished."
2,Access to power,Too very morbid. The plot is twisted and very unrealistic.You cannot condemn the whole election process as nothing but corruption and deceit.
4,Excellent read,Lots of twists and turns. A bit of a struggle at first but it just gets better. Loved the ending!
5,C-Span meets Hitchcock.,"What Grisham is to law, Ellis is to politicsAs a political professional, I can tell you, it is hard to find a newscast or an article, much less a novel, that accurately portrays what it is like to be inside of a high-pressure campaign.Robert Ellis' book does that and more.It is page turning thriller that seems to be ripped from the most recent tawdry scandals of the Beltway.Scummy candidates, immoral media types, souless aides...it's all here.Almost as much fun as discovering the resolve is seeing if you can guess which real life politicians his characters are based on.Mr. Ellis is an insider. And it shows.Access to Power is the best plane, beach, weekend read you'll have this year."
3,Good debut from a promising author....,"Robert Ellis debuts with 'Access to Power' - political consultant Frank Miles is at the top of his game. He wages senate and house campaigns, he even worked on the President's campaign. His firm, along with his two partners, is a success.Then his long time partner, Woody is murdered. Metro police immediately rule it a robbery gone bad. But Frank thinks differently and starts to follow the clues only he sees.This first novel is a little thin on character development and the plot is one-dimensional. But Ellis shows promise. If this is a series debut and his fledgling writing improves, he could become a must read.Recommended"
3,Too contrived,"The book had a very good storyline regarding political campaigns. However it got wrapped up in typical conspiracy and ""Thriller"" type plots.The hero Is always in an possible situation and. Miraculously escapes. The villain defies death and endures to the bitter end.Everything gets happily resolved in the final pages.The book had great potential but couldn't resist the commonplace.."
1,Waste of Money,Don't even bother with it... singer is horrible... instruments are below average at best.
5,"Mom, I hate you","Dr. Fleming's book, ""Mom,I Hate You"" is a practical, easily understandable guide to dealing with your child's words and behaviors. I would highly recommend this book to my clients and friends."
3,Good and bad,"This book is an easy read with lots of helpful information and tips on how to improve your relationship with your provocative child.However, the tips the good doctor gives on consequences made me cringe! He suggest punishments like taking away a favorite toy or insisting on an earlier bedtime. These ""consequences"" are not connected to the ""crime"" and therefore really not helpful in terms of helping a child to change.I recommend ""There's gotta be a better way"" by Becky Bailey for a guide to effective discipline."
5,Well thought-out with superb results,"You MUST have this book if you EVER played with these dolls as a child in the 1960's and/or 1970's. Even if you don't collect the dolls, the book will trigger your ""nostalgia option"". Fun and whimsical photographs with detailed descriptions."
4,Beutifully ilustratrted book,Beutifully ilustratrted book with basic cocktiel care information. Would be more useful if it provided healthcare & basic first aid information also.
5,Five Stars for Kristin Lavrandatter,An absolute classic; moving personal account of a woman's life which all women (and men) would enjoy. Norway in the 1300's comes alive in this incredible family saga.
3,A fair erotic thriller,"I'm sorry this movie is not available at ... at present, especially in its unrated format. This is my second favorite Joan Severance feature, mostly because of the ... scenes between her and her two male leads. She is steaming hot, especially on the kitchen table.As far as the story goes, it's a fairly rehashed film noir about a cop on the edge and the way his ... wife manipulates him into murdering her brother. He in turn is betrayed by her when she manipulates and beds an Internal Affairs cop who's investigating her husband. All for money.The main reason I rented this at the video store was for Joan Severance, and she delivers the goods. Good companion viewing for Payback, another steamy Severance flick."
4,The fun lasted more than one day,"You know how, when a kid gets something new, it's fun for a day or two? Well, with this Lego set that he received 3 weeks ago he still plays with it and has fun putting together the creatures. The only thing I wasn't thrilled about was that they show 2-3 creatures on the box, but you can only make one at a time that are in the instruction book."
4,Very fun lego set,It's really fun making your own crazy sea creatures! I recommend this set to anyone who likes legos.
4,The glow-in-the-dark pieces are very britlte,Great overall. My only complain was that the glow in the dark teeth broke very easily. Those pieces are different from the regular non-glow pieces.
2,"Good idea, bad invention","Now the idea behind this is really great, toss in some fresh garlic and you can have it at the ready to squeeze. The press itslef is of bad design. A girlfriend had one in her fridge, and everything smelled and tasted of garlic. Now I am a garlic fanantic, but so much as I love the taste of galic on my palate, I do not enjoy it in Sunny Delight. The fridge was overcoem with the smel, still smelled of garlic weeks later and the Sunny D as well as milk were tossed.."
2,works well but...,"I like the way this presses the garlic, but it doesn't close tightly enough to keep odors in. After only a few2 hours, my entire fridge smelled of garlic."
2,works well but...,"I like the way this presses the garlic, but it doesn't close tightly enough to keep odors in. After only a few hours, my entire fridge smelled of garlic."
2,Lacking,"Press doesn't hold much garlic in it (probably more than enough for typical American taste but I am a true Garlic lover) and what it will hold is not all that simple to load. Sadly the press block inside tends to leak a lot of the garlic juice through the back side so you actually lose a lot of the garlic essence.Even worse is that it's far from air tight so you really can't store garlic in it for any length of time (then again, since it holds so small an amount you end up using it all in one use). Garlic left in it even overnight in the refrigerator will dry out and lose almost all of it's flavor.Lastly, since it leaks you have to take the whole thing apart to clean it. While it's only 4 pieces apart, unwinding the ""screw"" on it to clean the back side is rather annoying.It's a neat toy and nothing more."
1,Highly Regretable Purchase,"I was so excited to try this product, but my hopes have been crushed. It's much smaller than I expected (I could only fit four cloves of garlic - more if I chopped them... but that's even more work), difficult to twist, messy clean-up and made of cheap plastic. My advice would be to splurge and buy a wonderful ""forty-dollar-range"" garlic press and save yourself the grief."
1,Garbage!!!,This is the worst written book about Elvis that I have ever read. The author stated thatElvis's mother got sick in Germany and then traveled back to Memphis. Her timeline and facts are horrible. This lady doesn't have a clue on how to write a book. She rambles from one thought to another with no coherent connection. I wish I had my money back.
4,Required reading,Anna Salter's book should be required reading for every parent and individual who works with sexual offenders. The book truely gives the reader what it promises in the title- ways to protect ourselves and our children.
4,Scary book,"Overall good book with useful information. The portion that addresses deflection vs detection appears to be the most likely useful portion of the book. The book is relatively raw, written for lay population, useful. Good tool for parents using the deflection strategies. this book will make you cringe and want to withdraw from society, these are accounts for illustration and real, not to be understated or overstated, the info just ""is."""
5,Required Reading,"Anna Salter mesmerizes the reader with first hand experiences and warnings about those who wreck havoc on society. This book ought to be required reading for parents, counselors and law enforcement individuals.This material is not light hearted reading it may even give you nightmares. However it will teach you to protect your children from stranger and friends alike."
5,Review,This book is a must for all parents and those who work in the department of keeping kids safe from predators. Once I started reading this book it was extremely hard for me to put it down.
3,Life Isn't That Black And White,"This book propagates what's already frequently portrayed in the media, an ""us versus them"" mentality in regards to sex offenders. To extrapolate, this is to say that sex offenders are monsters, somehow fundamentally different from everyone else. The author seems to sugar coat her experiences with this mentality. When she comes across sex offenders that seem ""normal"" or ""nice"", she chalks it up as their ruse to gain access to children or to otherwise take sexual advantage of people. Sorry, but life's not that simple, and it's potentially harmful to continue to promote this view. She sounds convincing though which is why I grant this book a 3 stars."
5,"Great Book!, tells truth about criminals","This book discusses the thought processes of criminals including rapists, murderers, pedophiles and sadists in detail. Understanding these scumbags is the first step to protecting yourself and family against them. There are multiple police officers and detectives in my family and we have discussed these topics. The book is highly accurate and well written."
1,They should call her ANN ASSAULTER LOL,"Her name should be Ann Asalter instead of Anna Salter, because reading this book was an assault on my intelligence! This book is a little old, but even so there are far better books on the subject, like Harmful to Minors by Judith LevineHarmful to Minors: The Perils of Protecting Children from Sex, The Trauma MythThe Trauma Myth: The Truth About the Sexual Abuse of Children--and its Aftermath, and Once Fallen by Derek LogueOnce Fallen. Of course, if you're only source of information is tabloid sensationalism and Nancy Grace and are a paranoid helicopter parent, then this book is for you. Much like her other works, this work is a fiction novel."
4,Very informative,"As a founder of a corporation dedicated to protecting children from predators and the like, I found this book very helpful. The author is very likeable, and has done exactly what I wanted to do. I think this is a book that parents should read for the protection of not only their children, but themselves as well.Again, although the topic is not exactly humorous, the author's thoughts are shared at the perfect time that I would be thinking the same things!"
5,"For your own sake and that of your children,, please read this book","I have worked with Sex Offenders for nearly 30 years , and found Dr. Salter's book excellent and would recommend it to any other professional.However, I am writing this review as a mother and grandmother. Dr. Salter gives a clear, and chillingly compelling account of how Predators, Pedophiles, Rapists, and other Sex Offenders"" can insinuate themselves into the lives of normal people, and the traumatic aftermaths caused by their behaviors.I bought copies of this book for my daugher and others that I care for .Reading first person accounts from offenders themselves of how they fooled and manipulated people in order to position themselves for their crimes was disturbing.The chapter on ""Sexual Sadists""was almost more than I could read, and I have heard a lot in my professional life.But overall,Dr. Salter's book provides valuable information to adults concerned with their own safety , and the safety of their children."
2,Passionate but Lacking,"Santa only knows, someone should write a decent overview of holiday movies, but this tome isn't it. Awkwardly arranged, filled with typos, poorly written (and seemingly not edited at all) and, perhaps worst of all, very narrow minded, this book is a huge disappointment. The authors reveal not only a sensibility so mainstream as to accept poor films because they ""work,"" but there is an obvious moral compass applied to their criticism (allusions to sex or any profanity automatically make a film bad).The Svehlas go into ridiculously superfluous detail in delineating the plots of these movies (while giving barely any historical background), then tack on ham handed critiques at the end. They obviously have a great deal of affection for the holidays and Hollywood, but passion isn't enough to make this a good book."
5,A classic on genuine anglicanism,"Michael Ramsey (former Archbishop of Canterbury) sets out the history and heart of anglicansim in this very readable introduction to Anglicanism. His insights and perceptions help us get to the history and heart of true anglicanism and its relationship to other churches, especially the Roman Catholic.The first 2 chapters are key for anyone wanting to discover or return to genuine anglicanism, versus a (post-)modernist, liberal interpretation. Enjoy it!"
3,"Slow, slow, slow","The main difference I notice between version 7 and version 8 is that 8 is incredibly slow. Perhaps now that everyone has a 3 GHz P4 (I don't) they think no-one will notice, but I certainly do. Others have made the same observation. Everything takes longer. A terrible upgrade, just on that score. STICK WITH v7."
4,You get more than what you pay for.,"The best way to describe this program is to say it's Photoshop 7.0's rival that is cheaper, can do everything photoshop can, the only tricky part is that some of the tools don't handle aswell and some handle better, like the brushes look all sketchy like Microsoft Paint but that can be easilly fixed with some knowhow.This program is great for newbies and children/teens to express themselfs with, please buy."
1,nothing easy about it,"Don't waste your time with this product or paint shop pro 9. Each time they ""upgrade"" they are more complicated.If you are very computer literate you might figure it out eventually.With paint shop pro 5 for example, it was simple enough you learn with ease while having fun. Not the case with the latest."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,"I've used several graphical software, and this is probably the worst one I've ever used. I have never met a program so user unfriendly. Save your money for Photoshop, I know I am."
5,Poor mans Photoshop,"If you can't afford the price of Photoshop, this is the product to get. Paint Shop Pro can do everything that Photoshop does at 1/4 the cost. It's a great product that I still use to this day!"
3,"Sadly, a mixed bag","I've been using Paint Shop Pro since version 5, and liked it. The features are excellent and the price is great. Version 8, however, has been taxing my patience. This is why:1. It's slow, sucking up loads of RAM and system resources, even on new PCs, and causing vector graphics (especially text) to become unusable.2. It's buggy, with frequent hangs, script errors and other glitches. For one complicated image job, I actually had to import my work into PSP 6, because version 8 simply refused to work properly. Again, vector graphics and text cause the most problems.Issues like these are unacceptable. PSP 8, in its current state, should not have been allowed out of beta testing. Until Jasc improves the quality of this release, I cannot recommend Paint Shop Pro. Save your money."
1,This computer literate gal just can't get it right with PSP 8,"I hear so many great things about this program, and for me being so very proficient with computer software, including that which allows me to write & publish my own web pages, I just cannot get this software mastered. I have tried on and off for over a year, and I still go back to my other software programs, as there is nothing simple about this PSP 8. Very frustrating, and the help available is no help."
4,Getting better,"I love PSP. I've used it since version 3, and I've always been impressed by what I could do with it. Paint Shop Pro 8 (and by ""8"" I'm really referring to ""8.1"") is the best yet. More intuitive, more features, etc.I have only 2 complaints that keep it from being 5 stars. One is that - depending on your RAM and CPU - it can take awhile to load its very large .dll library. It uses a lot of resources to do what it does.The other continues to be a peeve with me: the online help. For a product that does as much as it does, the help is far better than even version 5, but still not at the level of quality it could or should be. (For example, the online help says I can change the ruler increments in the Units box. It doesn't tell me where to FIND the ""Units box."")If you're going to spend money on a powerful graphics package, this is a bargain compared to the wildly overpriced and overrated Adobe product and does the job just as well."
3,...id go with photoshop...but thats just me,"All I have to say is that this thing is kind of a ram hog, takes forever for effects to render. Photoshop seems to have quite a bit more support from 3rd party plugin developers. Many many many plugin's available for photoshop which increases its value imensly. Photoshop Elements is only only like $20 more than Paint Shop Pro and its definitely worth it. There's really not to much to rave about with paint shop pro; think of it as a stripped down version of photoshop elements. This is only my opinion but whatever..."
2,"Ugh, God its horrible.....","For those who still have psp 7, don't even bother upgrading to this. The interface is horrible, and the only thing it does is enhance pictures a lot better than 7. So if thats all your interested in doing, then waste all your money."
1,Buggy and slooow,"I'm PSP user for several years now. Two months ago I upgraded to PSP8 and I am very disappointed. Launching PSP takes 3 times longer than launching PSP7. In complex PSP images with multiple layers and a lot of vector graphics selecting a single object can take up to 5 seconds (you click an object, for 5 seconds nothing happens and then it gots selected). Strange error messages are shown while working with PSP8 that do not make any sense. Saving GIF files doesn't really work, looks like there are bugs in save routine. Once in a while PSP8 completely stalls and the CPU utilization goes up to 100%.All this behaviour I experienced with the latest PSP patch (8.1) and I NEVER had anything like this with good ol' PSP7.Yesterday I installed PSP7 again..."
1,Version 8 is absolutely horrible!,"I have version 7, and love it!Upgraded to version 8, and hated it.Very sluggish in operation, user interface iscompletely different and difficult use.I un-installed version 8, and went back to version 7."
4,Jasc Paint Shop Pro 8,"Good product, but I bought this version and LESS than one month later Jasc Paint Shop Pro 9 came out and Jasc wanted to charge the full upgrade price. Just check to be sure Jasc doesn't have a new version coming out when you buy Paint Shop Pro ( current version is 10) because Jasc will make no allowance for the fact that you JUST bought their older version."
5,Glad I bought it,"My husband and I are just starting our new vegan diet after reading many books about how bad animal products, all fat and dairy are for your health.This book is very helpful, with easy to follow recipes and lots of useful information. I have made the bean dip, tofu mayo, seitan roast and many others. I found them all simple to make and very good. I will be using this cookbook a lot as I continue to learn this new way of cooking. Although we have had to buy lots of new items we have saved much more by eliminating meat, fats and diary. It is even easier now to find places to eat that serve vegan. I haven't made any of the many dessert recipes but they all look really good."
5,Another great book by Bryanna!,"Bryanna is a really great recipe creator! The recipes always turn out so perfectly that you know she has spent a great deal of time perfecting them.I highly recommend her cookbooks. Also, not sure if the recipe is in this book or her (Almost) No Fat Holiday Cookbook, but the corn butter is AMAZING! It tastes so similar to margarine!"
1,grand expectations,"This book (Don't be fooled by the titile) is great - if you're a VEGAN, and not a Vegetarian. It's also splendid if you have a health food store close at hand, because the majority of the ingredients in just about every recipe are not to be found not at your local grocer. I was disappointed - as my hopes had been so high about this book. I opened my package, excited and as I went along, page after page I soured. Sorry but this book just wasn't anything near to what I was expecting."
2,NOTHING SPECIAL,"I read several human kinetics book and I was very satisfied with knowledge and information in them. So I had some expectation on human kinetics dvd. I bought this one for test, if it is OK I will buy all of their dvds. I did not found almost any new or interesting information here in this dvd. In any book aboot speed you will find much much more. The level is low, and the content is 95% only running speed and 100% leg, but nothing new here. Jumping speed,leg movement speed or kicking speed or any other speed in sport is even not mentioned. So the title is totaly wrong, and content is imho low level. For me, result is that I will not buy any other human kinetics dvd, it is not even close to the level of their books.Today,(Aug. 2008) I opened a ""Training for speed, agility and quickness"" book(with included DVD) also from human kinetics. It is much better and more complete product than this DVD, and recomend it highly."
4,"Good quality, easy return",I ordered this for my Dad for Christmas and chose the size based on the Carhartt sizing guidelines; it was too small. Turns out the 44 Tall is what Daddy would have ordered if I had asked him because that's what he always wears in Carhartt; it just wasn't what the chart said for his measurements. He loves the coveralls and hopefully they'll keep him warm working outdoors all winter.
4,Good for starters...but not complete by any means!,"It's a great disc for those who don't have a lot of Elvis collections already. Otherwise, probably a bit redundant. Plus the track listing here is wrong and there are only 20 songs."
3,I bought it to replace the one with the product.,I bought this to replace the one that came with the air purifier. I bought an extra one in case they run out of stock lateras companies change replacement parts so you have to buy new items.
5,<:3///)~~~,"My parents read me this book when I was little (I'm 22). I really liked it and my mother made little references to pig will and pig won't when my brother and I misbehaved (or behaved). I don't think any of the pictures in the book were inappropriate. I mean it's entirely up to the individual whether they spank their children or not, but I can't see any harm in children knowing that some people did and do spank their children."
1,A very negative book,"I was considering buying this book because my son loves Richard Scarry and I thought it might be a cute way to reinforce manners. Fortunately, I found a copy of the book at his play group and was able to read it first. Pig Wont is shown bare-bottomed getting a spanking from his father for not listening, is called a ""Bad Pig!"" for not following directions, and is treated in a very unsympathetic way. This kind of stern, un-understanding way of disciplining a child is unappealing to me and (I believe) unhelpful for the child. The book came across as very negative to me; instead of focusing on why a child would WANT to behave, it focuses on the bad things that will happen to him if he doesn't. That's not the message I want to send to my child."
3,3 stars,"Wasn't the greatest but different.I didn't know if Ben Kingsley was ""a"" killer or not.But I later remembered he was a trained code breaker / tracker for the FBI."
3,Good...but not great,"I thought it was good and I think people should see it. If you like these kind of movies like Silence of the lambs trilogy, seven, etc, than see this movie becuase its worth it. Carrie Ann Moss is also hot."
2,Kingsly is ok,"Suspect Zero, even with Ben, is still a weak movie. It tries to be cool and gory (kinda like Seven), but it comes off a less than what it wants to be. It's gory and there's a plot line, but the line is a little weak. It eventually goes into the sappy emotional territory and loses its way."
5,EXCELLENT !!,This movie took the whole serial killer genre to another level. It was engrossing and kept me guessing the whole time. Aaron Eckhart was great in this but KINGSLEY as always was AMAZING !!!I have to own this DVD. I recommend it highly !! So why are you still reading this? GO GET IT BUSTER !!!
4,Stylish Serial-Killer Movie,"I very much enjoyed the stylish way this serial-killer movie was presented. It also gets high points for keeping ones interest all the way.Aaron Eckhart and Ben Kingsley are very good. Kinslgey, unfortunately, doesn't appear until over halfway through but made up for his lack of screen time with an intense performance. He's good at that sort of thing (see ""Sexy Beast"" for another recent example.)The story, claimed to be a true one out of U.S. military files, is still a bit ""suspect"" to me. Maybe I am bit skeptical about these ESP-type stories which the film world loves to promote. Nonetheless, this is a very interesting film, nicely shot and an underrated one since it never got much publicity.If you like crime movies, this is one to check out."
2,Wasted potential,"An FBI agent with a troubled past hunts a serial killer. Or so it seems. An interesting idea an a good cast, Aaron Eckhart, Ben Kingsley and Carrie Anne Moss, are wasted on a boring, uninspired screenplay and unappealing characters. There are only a few interesting scenes with a lot of time in between them. The director has managed to create a dark atmosphere, but it doesn't keep the movie from being boring. It feels much longer than its 99 minute running time. I wanted to like it but I didn't. Not recommended."
2,Screenplay-Writing-By-Numbers,"Let's see: a handsome detective tortured by some traumatic event in his past; a brilliant bad guy who fights like the Incredible Hulk despite his advanced age and decrepitude; a plucky female partner who saves the handsome detective's bacon at the last second; and let's not forget the abrasive and highly obtuse police sergeant.Just a bit formulaic, don't you think?"
3,Intense,"I am a fan of both Aaron Eckhart and Ben Kingsley. In this movie they are locked in a frighteningly urgent mind drama. As continues towards its inevitable conclusion, I was drawn in to the intense struggle. This may be a 'small' movie, but there is nothing small about the story line or its execution."
3,Suspect,"An okay thriller, in a 'Se7en' meets 'Minority Report' kind of way. There are a few too many shots of Aaron Eckhart slumped over a desk covered with scraps of papers that may have been meaningful, but were in reality disorganized, arbitrary and often confusing. The movie too often resembled that desk."
3,I suspect this movie could have used a better editor!,"Others have reviewed the plot. My comment regarding this movie is that too much time was spent on inconsequential scenes, while more could have been devoted to explaining the 'remote viewing'. This feels like one of those movies that was chopped down, leaving one to ""catch up"" or ""make up"" to the directors's intent.With that said, I still enjoyed Kingsley's performance immensely. Unfortunately, Moss was just meant as eye-candy, she does not do much in this film... sigh.I would describe this as a ""housework"" movie... good for watching while you are folding t-shirts!"
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! [...],"Movies like this absolutely kill me! The story they have to work with is top notch, the cast is terrific, and the movie sucked. The movie is all about tracking down this infamous serial killer with a horrible and gruesome reputation. They don't show what led to this reputation, any of his crimes, or what got them to that point. It's like jumping into a crappy direct to video sequel, after missing the blockbuster film that led to it. Nothing significant ever happens in this movie! Which then begs the question, what's the point in even making it?"
4,Zak Penn {Avengers} Does It Again,"Another weird but great story from the pen of Zak Penn [Avengers, Hulk, X-Men Last Stand]. Directing pacing lagged in spots, and script needed a rewrite to tighten up the ending, but the story is great, if you can stomach the gore of serial killers brought to justice in creative non-judicial ways. Wish there had been a larger role for Carrie-Ann Moss {Matrix}."
4,Nail Biter,"Very strange, but in a creepy flick way. I'd watch it again.Kept me on the edge of my seat."
2,Go with the V-Cube instead.,This was the first cube I bought after my standard 3x3x3 Rubik's cube. The quality was very poor. The 4x4x4 has too much play and quickly falls apart if you aren't careful.I've seen much better quality from the V-Cubes. They are much smoother and don't fall apart as easily.
1,Broke within 24 hours,"We love Rubik's cubes but it was very very disappointing that this item broke within the first 24 hours. Particularly disappointing since it was a gift for our son. According to Amazon, our window for returns has expired. Very very very disappointing."
2,Terrible Cube,"This cube is expensive, and terrible. Within the first five minutes it broke. I would recommend highly buying the LanLan 4x4 rubiks cube. The 4x4 cube by Rubik's is terrible."
3,"Great toy, but.......","the durability of toy is horrible. The 3x3 is a much sturdier cube. My son had this a week and it broke apart. Others I know have had the same problem. I will probably purchase another one for my son strictly because he is a Rubik's cube whiz kid. Just be advised that the 4x4 is much weaker in construction than its brother the 3x3. Both cubes are educational with their problem solving. My son did not really find the 4x4 anymore challenging than the 3x3. I gave this a 3 star rating only because of its durability. Otherwise, it is a 5 star toy."
4,Rubiks 5x5,A great toy attractively packed. Good quality and very durable.My son has dropped it a couple of times and there are no damages.Toy has great educational value.
5,Rubik's Cube 4x4,"It came in a timely fashion, it was completely new and it works fine. I am completely satisfied with this product."
1,Big disappointment!,"I used to love playing with the 3x3 Rubik's cube as a kid and decided to get it for my son for Christmas. I mistakenly ordered the 4x4, but decided it didn't matter - still the same kind of fun and challenge. The day it was opened, the stickers started to come off and when I tried to use it, within the first 30 seconds, four pieces came off, one of which broke and can't be fixed! I just went online to order the 3x3, but are finding similar reviews about stickers, etc. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!"
1,"Same experience - fragile (okay), stickers peel off with use (not okay)","I bought the cube, and it was in ruins a week later due to the fact that the cube started showing signs of flakiness by the second day: some of the stickers (mostly the white and blue ones) had begun peeling off. This is beyond belief because this toy should have been designed / built with the durability to withstand some handling; the statement ""if you learn how to solve the cube, then you'll be performing thousands of turns on it"" is spot-on."
2,I am so SAD.,"I love the original 3x3 Rubik's cube and I play with it all of the time. All of my friends had this 4x4 and it looked really fun. So I bought this 4x4 Rubik's cube and waited many days for it in the mail. Then I got the package, opened it up, started playing with it, and then 3 pieces snapped out and fell on the floor. One of those pieces was a center piece that can't be put back on. I wasn't even spinning the cube that hard, and it just broke. So right now I wasted 20 bucks on a broken piece of junk cube."
1,Rubik's Cube,"Purchased a 4x4 rubik's cube and it lasted no more than 5 minutes before it fell apart. The pieces started coming off of the 'ball' that is inside the cube. Don't buy this thing, it is a waste of money!"
3,Reassembly May Be necessary,"This puzzle (also known as Rubik's Revenge) is good fun - and because it has another layer of movement, it is much more likely to fall apart than the 3x3x3 cube. However, the puzzle of reassembly is also quite fun - and requires no force! A clue to reassembly - make sure that the last two pieces are the same colour edge pieces - and they will (very gently) snap into place. A second clue: only the centre pieces (four flats pieces on each side) fit into the grooves of the ball - be gentle, and your cube will be as good as new. Start with the four centre pieces of one colour at the bottom - and build up the cube layer by layer. Remember! No force!"
3,ok cube,"it came one day early (that's good), but the stickers were already peeling and it wont go back down even with super glue."
2,"Good, until it breaks","I have been a big Rubiks cube fan for a while but, I lost a lot of my interest in them with cube. I solved it once and then it broke.I was really disappointed in its quality. It doesn't move well at all and it breaks if you dont precisely turn it every time.Get it if you want, but it won't last long."
2,4x4. Fun but weak.,I got this 4x4 as a gift from a friend. I had solved a 3x3 more times than I could count so solving this wasn't that hard. But the first thing I noticed immediately was it was extremely difficult to turn. I lived with it for the time being and continued. On my 10th or so move one piece popped out the edge. I had heard that this was prevalent so I simply popped it back in and continued. 20 or so moves later all of the sudden 4 or 5 pieces popped out and before I knew it the entire cube was in pieces. I was angry for sure so that night I spent an hour re-assembling the cube. I had successfully done and lubricated the cube so now I could turn it quite nicely. I scrambled and began to solve. This time about 45 moves into it 6 or 7 pieces popped out without warning and the cube was destroyed yet again. The Rubik's brand 4x4 is not very well built and I would suggest a cube made by Eastsheen or QJ. Don't buy this particular cube.
3,There are better cubes out there.,When you start buying larger cubes look for the non Rubik's brands as Rubik's branded cubes are not designed as well. My Rubiks 4x4 is very loose which makes it hard to line up all of the rows inorder to turn it. Making the solving process slow and tedious.
3,Read this before Buying,"This cube is not too bad of a buy considering that it is only $20.However... When I first opened it I found that there were ABSOLUTELY NO INSTRUCTIONS! That's right, no way to solve it! What is with that? Then after I mixed it up I noticed that it was hard to turn the inner layers. This cube has no springs or anything to make turning it easier. Then, after my 100th or so solve I noticed that the cheap stickers were falling off. Not in any particular order. Now after the 200th solve or so I notice that the Cubes are wanting to fall out of place and snap back in after a while. Very annoying because this causes the whole cube to lock up. Other that those issues, getting the whole thing solved again is quite a challenge. It feels great to solve it. However, If you want a good cube for your money, Check out Vcube or eastsheen. Because this cube is not the best out there. Do not be surprised if this cube does not last."
2,Very disappointed.,"Please be advised that this specific brand needs improvements, if broke in only few days of use, without any resistance to mild use. Get the Lanlan which is cheaper and is very easy to turn."
2,Very breakeable and hard to use,"I got this cube, and on the first day, one of the pieces broke, meaning that I had to order another. Even with the new one, it is incredibly hard to turn and constantly catching on itself, and I don't want to turn it too hard for fear that it might break again. Also, pieces are constantly falling out as I am turning it. I would advise getting an older version of the 4x4x4, because the ones that came out before it was re-designed are much better at turning, and stay together."
1,BLOCKS FELL OUT AFTER ONE WEEK,"BLOCKS FELL OUT AFTER ONE WEEK, REINSTALLED THEM AND IT WORKED FOR ANOTHER WEEK. NOEW THE INTERNAL CONNECTIONS BROKE., IT DONE. CERTINALY NOT THE QUALITY OF THE ORGINAL."
2,Too clunky,I should have researched more before buying this cube. It is really hard too move and it feels like the cubies could break if you turn too strong
4,Fun for young teens,My 13 year old daughter conquered the 3x3 and now is playing with the 4x4. She likes it very much.
1,What a piece of crap,"I just got the cube, using it for the first time. In about 4 minutes, one of the corner pieces broke. The plastic broke off so now its garbage. What a piece of crap. A complete waste of money. I want my money back. DO NOT BUY THIS.Dont buy it. DO NOT BUY IT."
3,"Very fun toy, but stickers peel off","Very fun toy. Too bad that after two days of use, the stickers began to peel off. Should solve that problem. I'm not the only one who thinks the same"
1,Broken,"I got this for my close friend for christmas to replace the one he had lost, and he took it out of the packaging and rotated it a couple times to mix it up and one white middle cube broke letting the whole thing fall apart. Unfortunately we had just taken the trash out because the garbage truck was coming up the road, so we lost the packaging and cannot return it. I assume a factory defect on this one because I have never seen one break like that. Now I have to wait until I have extra money to buy another. In the mean while my friend and I get to stare at a ziploc bag full of pieces that serve no purpose."
1,Shameful quality - Complete Waste of Money,I hate writing reviews.. but this product is so seriously bad.. that I don't want another person to waste their money. I bought 2 of these for my husband and myself... they broke within days!! one the next the other 2 days later.. I ended up ordering them again from a professional speed-cubing company located in Germany (Cubikon) .. I am so disappointed that companies can get away with selling such a bad quality product and stealing from consumers. I am out 40 dollars.. Nobody cares.. and life is to short for me to pursue this any further..I am only writing this so you don't make the mistake I made.. I did not listen to the reviews here either
3,Rubiks Revenge,"ok, so my first one exploded within minutes of opening it and no matter how many times I put it back together it would just fall apart (turns out it had a stripped screw hole on the inner sphere that holds the triangles onto the core). well amazon sent me another one and I literally got it in one day (and they paid all shipping costs). my new one is much nicer and only falls apart if I really torque it the wrong way (which is perfectly normal). if your new to 4x4x4 rubiks cubes don't expect a durable toy and don't move it around too fast because its pretty fragile and not fun to put back together."
2,Get a different 4x4 cube,As usual the Rubik's brand cubes fall short of the competition. Amazon has way better 4x4s for way cheaper. This thing locks up so badly that it is almost impossible to solve. It also pops occasionally. I would say this cube is definitely not worth the buy. Shop around on here and find a better one. This is the worst 4x4 on the market.
1,This Cube Is BAD!!!,"Knowing how to solve the 3x3 Rubik's cube i was excited for the challenge of the 4x4. I ordered a Rubik's and did not enjoy solving it because it was so bad. After watching a few legitimate reviews I decider to look at a new 4x4. I ordered a LanLan 4x4 and I have shunned my rubiks ever since. It cost half as much and was more then twice as good. The Rubiks turns horribly and locks up consistently. I can solve the lanlan twice as fast and I thoroughly hate the Rubik's. Do NOT BUY THIS for the same $20 you could get a LanLan or better yet a Eastsheen, Meffert, or Maru."
1,Piece of Junk,"I recieved this cube quickly and in good shape. After playing with the cube for less than 10 minutes, it broke. Complete Rip-Off. I am very upset that this product was so poorly put together."
5,rubiks,"the cube was extremely difficult to maneuver. it kept getting stuck and ended up dropping several cubes. i was able to snap them back on, but not sure if they were in the correct position - which would obviously alter the game."
3,For those with sticker problems,"It is true that none of the rubik's cube stickers last very long but this is not much of a problem as replacements are cheap and available at cubesmith.com. Cubesmith make the best cube stickers and they last for a very long time. They also make tiles that are nice and thick and last even longer. Any time I buy a cube I also put in an order at cubesmith for proper stickers. As for the cube itself, it is ok but there are better ones out there. The Eastsheen 4x4x4 is very popular and the newer Meffert's 4x4x4 is also very good and comes with tiles by default. Both are better than the Rubik's as they spin better, lock up less and have better stickers. Another point to keep in mind is that the Rubik's 4x4x4 cannot be adjusted and therefore eventually becomes very loose.I have had mine for several years and can easily slide a paddle pop stick in between the cubies. Overall, the Rubik's 4x4x4 is ok but the alternative brands are both cheaper and better."
2,Try another brand - quality is too low with this one,It weorks but it is hard to move the cube around. Price was low but you get what you pay for. I would not buy this brand again. hard to move the cube.
2,junk,"For those of you who are just getting into cubing, I'm sure you have a positive opinion of the Rubik's company, the first, largest, and most famous of the companies that make these puzzly cubes.Unfortunately, by this point the company has gotten fat, lazy, and complacent. Their cubes blow.In particular, with this one, the 4x4x4, the stickers will come off before long, meaning the puzzle won't be solvable because you'll have too many white cubes. It's also not very well put together mechanically and will likely come apart. I know the 4x4x4 and anything larger is not recommended for speedcubing for this reason, but still.By this point, you should get your cubes from companies like Lanlan and Eastsheen. Even though you may not recognize their names, they still put out better products that last longer."
2,Far too fragile for any real use.,"Thinking that this would be a more challenging toy than the 3x3 I purchased it. However within a few hours I noticed a few of the stickers were already coming off. This by itself was annoying, but within the next day or two, the whole thing became disassembled in my hands. Even knowing that they were going to be fragile from other reviews I managed to break it. If you buy this, I recommend making sure you're very gentle with it, and make sure all the pieces are lined up before you try to turn a section. Or just keep it as a desk piece for conversation.In conclusion, I would not recommend this for someone who's looking to get any real use out of it.(As a side note, I also purchased the 5x5, and had the same sticker problem, however, when the 4x4 broke I didn't try to use the 5x5 and it just sits on my desk looking pretty)"
2,4x4x4,The cube is not the best. Probably the worst of the Rubik's brand. The center pieces pop off easily and can not be replaced. I turned it once and a piece came off. I reccomend to buy a speed cube like a Lanlan.
2,Disappointed,"After thoroughly enjoying the 3X3, I thought my family would like the 4X4, but it falls apart very easily and won't stay together...kind of difficult as you twist it and try to solve it."
2,"Good Mind-game, Bad Quality","A 4x4 is quite more interesting than a 3x3. This particular cube falls apart before the stickers would peel, as in my case. The inner workings of the cube are loose and jam easily. So if you have much patience and a lot of time, this cube would be fine. However, if you wish for a better quality one, I have heard that Meffert's are quite good, although not currently being sold on Amazon."
2,cheap,"I bought this on a whim while on amazon, just to satisfy my 80's kid inside me, but only really played it a handful of times (was never really good at it. never got the full colors on each side). Both of my kids have played with it, and i understand that it is a pretty basic piece of plastic, but after only a couple weeks, the pieces were loose, and the stickers had begun to peel (this is from normal play use, not from us throwing it at a wall or anything).So, as much as i wanted to give this a great review, I would think that there are other Rubix Cubes by other manufacturers that won't fall apart as this one has. Give them a try instead."
3,Fragile,"I got my rubik's revenge, and on the first day it fell apart. After spending time putting the peices back together, the cube was very loose and would not turn easily. I was not able to even use my cube before it fell apart. Be carefull with this toy."
2,DONT GET !!,"I love the Rubik's 3x3 it's durable. & after a while it starts to spin like a speed cube. But the second I pulled the 4x4 out of the box i was so excited. But the same night 3 pieces poped out. & was very difficult to put back in. & Even when I did they would poke out... it's horribly made, I highly suggest the LanLan 4x4"
3,If You're Into Speed-Cubing...,"If you're into speed-cubing, this cube isn't for you. You're better off paying $25+ for one of the better models like Eastsheen or Mefferts. I received mine today and pieces are already starting to pop. It turns horribly and it doesn't seem to be getting any looser.However, I bought this cube in order to learn how to solve it. If those were your intentions, then by all means buy this cube and have fun with it."
5,An easy competitor with the original Lion King soundtrack!,"Anyone who's ever seen the show will tell you it's stunning, visually and musically. With songs like ""He lives in you"" and ""The circle of life"" from the movies, as well as worthy additions such as ""Shadowland"" and ""The Lioness hunt"" it has an amazing and very Africanized sound to it. It is deeply moving and entertaining from the beginning to the very end. I strongly recommend it for anyone who liked the Lion King movies soundtracks or generally likes music! =P"
2,What I expected from Amongst Ourselves,"I was looking for a book that would actually help me on working with inside parts. This book delved mininimally in this area and then went back to basic living with DID, i.e., safety plan, letting people know - the basics. Not at all what I was looking for."
2,The Book Review,"This book is shipped from America, so there is a bit of a wait for it (standard post).This book is mostly written based on the experiences of Karen Marshall, so you might find yourself thinking you are more ill than you are. Bear in mind that symptoms can vary to a more or a less degree.If you are looking for a cure you will not find it in this book. I did gain a better understanding of myself. However, self help is not easy. I found myself annoyed, upset, tearful and at times a little confused.Is this book worth getting? Yes, if only to gain a little understanding of how YOU work. Just don't start thinking you are more ill than you are."
3,Very Basic For Someone Who's Had DID,"This book is good in the sense that it explains alot to the newly diagnosed or their significant other. However, I found that most if it was just asking you to answer questions in your journal and telling you what you already know (If you've had DID for more than 6 months). Easy read though."
4,Great demos,"Don't expect to hear anything like Dechristianize. This release is an Vital Remains demo compilation.The Black Mass (1991) 7""Excruciating Pain (demo) (1990)Reduced to Ashes (demo) (1989)Yes it's worth the price. Sounds like a cross between Blasphemy and Sepultura(Morbid Visions). Some great riffs on these demos. Best songs are ""Of Pure Unholyness"", ""Human Sacrifice"", ""Resurrected"", ""Excrutiating Pain""."
1,Die-Hard Fans Only!,"I really dug Vital Remains' last album ""Dechristianized"" for its mix of precise brutality, melody, and clean production. I've listened to death metal since back in the day where only a few dudes knew anything about it. And this album - this collection of old (ancient-sounding BS) from Vital Remains beginnings - is an abomination to everything metal has accomplished in the last several years!!The cheeseball dime-a-dozen riffs, ungodly horrible production (I can't imagine what the demos sounded like before they were ""remastered""), sloppy playing, and hilarious ""snarling vocals"" add up to a hell of an experience. I guess if I was 11 years old and had never heard death metal, this could possibly be cool -- but it would have to be 1986. These guys seemed to be behind their time even in the early days, why would they want to show this to everyone with a 2006 release of such rubbish? Just my opinion, but this one really rubbed me the wrong way."
5,Mean Genes can transform your thinking!,"Mean Genes gives a great explanation of how biology and evolution influence all kinds of behaviors in your life. It is fascinating to see how evolution could impact everything from personal savings rates to attitudes towards gambling. As someone who has studied economics a great deal in college, I was particularly interested in how evolution and biology are shown to impact economic decisions. The usage of animal examples are also fun and help to prove the points.This book is educational, but written in such a manner that it is very entertaining and easy to understand for anyone-A MUST READ!"
5,I can't stop talking about this book,"This book is so insightful. I have been interested in psychology for several years now, especially evolutionary, and this book ties together everything I've been learning. And it's fun and easy to read. I couldn't put it down! I first got a copy from the library and liked it so much I'm buying my own. It's funny, straight forward, intelligent without being at all preachy or pedantic. The format is inviting, the topics totally relatable, the examples perfectly highlighted by analogies (which I love). It explaines the basis for everything my friends do--as well as myself!--and gives clear explanations for where all this crazy behavior comes from. I love it.I am a psychology doctoral student, but absolutely anyone would be able to read this and appreciate it."
1,Pseudoscience in bullet points,"This book offers a dumbed-down, sound-bite approach, via its collection of vaguely interrelated paragraph-long observations, to an assortment of topics. Some of it seems like checkstand reading. In the (successful) effort to supply readers with an avalanche of factoids suitable for chitchat, any scholarship that might have been utilized is, instead, sacrificed. Arguments (the existence, for example of DNA testing to determine paternity) that would contradict some of its silliness is left out. Pop culture, advertising, rumors, humorous bits, and a mishmash of anecdotal evidence combine and bubble in this stew. It's more of an idea for a board game, really - than a thoughtful study. Instead of citing their references, the authors add a note asserting that their book has been ""assidiously researched and documented."" They name their fact-checkers, and the reader is then invited to visit the ""Mean Genes"" website. A cynical and disappointing read."
1,Not relevant now or then,"A juvenile self-help manual, by two PhD's who shouldn't be, serves to confirm a lack of erudition when written that is even more irrelevant now."
1,lean spleens,A pathetic mish-mash of unsatisfying and poorly-connected material. The authors have PhDs? They should have taken more writing coursework. Perseus Publishing must have a bloated balance sheet to be able to print this.
5,"Do yourself a favor, buy this book then read it!","Forget the Oprah list of ""self-improvement"" books, everything you need to know about why you do what you do is right here in this fantastic, easy to read book that anyone can understand. Want to know why you can't save money, lose weight, are afraid of snakes but not cars? It's all here and more! Thanks Terry Burnham and Jay Phelan for sharing your insights with all of us."
2,Written on an very basic insight level!,"Reminds me of every other oversimplified self-help booklet. I read the entire book(let) in about 45 minutes-yearning to find a tidbit of information the average-read college graduate would not already know. Recommend to look elsewhere if you enjoy reading new, insightful information."
2,Too much useful or usless info !!!!,"If you enjoy reading a book that starts off discusing a topic as if the entire chapter will be devoted to this subject, this is not the book for you.The problem with this book is they starting off talking about x substance and the next thing you know a million other subjects are brought up. This book reads like a reserch paper put togethere the day before it is due in the middle of the night and afterwards your Professor looks at you with the expression, WHAT THE HECK WAS THIS BOOK ABOUT !MORE FOCUS !"
4,Dead Room,I downloaded this e-book from Amazon.com to my Kindle Fire. The author did a good job righting this e-book. I started reading this book and was hooked or drawn into the story right away. The author does a good job taking his time setting the scene for the story. There are good police procedures written in the story. The characters have a good rich depth to them. The Lawyer smoking the cigar I could almost smell the smoke. The plot and tension definitely build and unfold in the story. The main character Teddy is under a lot of strain and out of his element which increases the tension. The story reads very well and is fluent. The formatting and presentation of this e-book is excellent. There was one typographical error in the e-book. I have and would recommend this book to a friend.
5,Must read,Excellent. Could not stop reading. Would read more of his books. Gripping story line. Fast paced. Would recommend this book
5,The Dead Room,"Very well written fast-paced escape reading. Interesting plot, believable characters, not a dull moment. I am looking forward to read more from the author."
5,New find,Just recently discovered this author and have read two of his books. I am very impressed and will read his next when it is published.
2,Not interested,"I just could not get into this book, no matter how hard I tried. A young girl is found murdered and horribly mutilated in her family's home. A young attorney is forced by his boss to represent the defendant. Skilled in real estate law, the young lawyer is thrown into the world of criminal law, and he has to re-educate himself."
1,So boring I couldn't finish,"I saw that this book had a lot of positive reviews and it sounded intersting so I gave it a try. I made it maybe 25% of the way through before I just couldn't take it anymore and gave up. I found it incredibly boring . . . to the point that my mind would actually wander while reading it. I didn't care at all about the characters or what happened to them, the whole thing was sub-par. I don't know what the other reviewers saw in it that I didn't but to me it was mind-numbingly borning."
2,Should Know Better,"I avoid reading books that don't have editorial reviews. They're usually poorly written, the plot doesn't work or something is missing. I made an exception in this case. True, the story kept me marginally interested enough to keep reading to the end, and based on the reader reviews, I kept expecting more. I never got it and the end was extremely unsatisfying.If you're like me, and find that there are more than enough well written, well plotted stories out there - more than there is time to read them all, then don't bother with this one.By the way, someone needs to tell Mr. Ellis or his editor that the word recant means to make a formal disavowal of a previous statement. It does not mean to tell what happened, as it was used three times in this novel. The word used should have been ""recount""."
5,Never see it coming!,"This is a fantastic read! The story line masterfully written with suspense and clever characters! All the aspects of an edge your seat thriller that doesn't fail to surprise you! The characters are relatable and witty, leaving you enthralled in their personal struggles! I definitely recommend this book!"
4,The dead room,An excellent thriller...too many twists and turns to count. Sullivan coordinated ending. If you like Michael Connelly you will like this.
5,The Dead Room,I found this book to be very entertaining. It kept my interest from start to finish. I would recommend this book.
4,A gripping read,"I had never read this author before, but I believed in his Characters from the start, they weren't perfect. The plot was solid with constant information developing the story and characters. Looking forward to reading this author again"
4,Almost a 5...,"This was a truly good book. I will say I enjoyed every single word, up until the last few chapters. I understand there were some sub-plots that needed stitched up, but those last few chapters were more of a lick and a promise. Set up for a sequel?Less one star for some editing and grammar issues and that last chapter. Gr."
3,Not so unputdownable but okay,"This book is an ok read. It's really not unputdownable or a rollercoaster ride. It is just ok. The story's about Teddy Mack, an inexperienced laywer at a big firm. He gets into a case involving a murder and a possible serial killer."
2,Unsatisfied,This book was decent until the last page. The ending was horrible. Really???? I am completely disappointed. I purchased another book buy Robert Ellis that I have not read yet. After this disappointment I don't even want to read another book written by him.
5,Great book!,This book had great twists and turns. I thought the writer did a great job keeping things moving along. I plan to read more Robert Ellis books.
4,Lots of twists,This book was full of twists and surprises. I love this kind of adventure and suspense. You beginto figure it out for another surprise. I will say the ending leaves u hanging
4,An excellent mystery,"This book by Ellis is an excellent mystery. Any mystery reader will enjoy the plot(s) and the characters which are to be found in the book. Without telling the story as others will have already done, it is well written, easy to read, and very interesting. I enjoyed it.J. Robert Ewbank author ""Wesley's Wars"" and ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the Isms"""
3,"Good, not great",Liked the few surprises along the way. I also liked knowing who done it early on. Just wasn't as much of a page Turner as others of the same genre.
1,Less than zero,Ellis starts out by hooking the reader with a Grisham-like exciting attorney story; then steals a plotline right out of Rainmaker. I stopped reading then.....why buy a knock-off of Grisham when the real thing is so much better.Copycat?
4,Great read,The book was very interesting. Didn't like the ending. It could be a great movie. I enjoyed it a great deal. Read it one-day.
4,The dead room,This was my first Robert Ellis book and I'm looking forward to reading the others. I enjoyed the plot and the twist.
4,pretty good story line,"This was a free book, so I was surprised that the story line was as complex as it was. i enjoy good mysteries and this one kept me interested throughout most of the book. the characters were likeable and the writing style was good as well."
5,all about the mitfords,"this book is (almost) ""the holy grail"" of the mitford family history. it is a great read and so fascinating. it is everything the reader wants to know and is written by a close family member. author jonathan guinness is diana mitford's son.i recommend this book highly as a ""starter"" book for those who are interested in learning about this unusual family. i would also add,to check out other books by other authors. this gives a more,broad perspective of the mitfords and would be written by someone who can see the family in a different light,so to speak...still a great book!"
2,"definitely not ""feed the cat""","don't buy this CD if you are not a DJ. I recently bought Agent K's ""Feed the Cat"" which is a very pleasant mix of nujazz/electronica/neosoul/house. Easy a 5 star CD, in fact, one of the best CD's period. Being that i don't know much about Agent K, I assumed that this would be the same or close..............WRONG.This is a fast paced, aggressive, eletronic/synthesized CD -- now, all this on steroids. Now you get the picture.If you are not ready to sweat and take your ears on an acidic trip, please don't bother.Its not a bad CD, thats why I gave it 3 stars, but mos def not ""Feed the Cat"" !!peace"
3,a funny fu flick,"Alright movie more of a comedy then anything else with some interesting kung fu around it. The master of the bamboo stick, beggars fist battles it out with the master of the iron head style. not a bad one, but not a must have."
2,Not what I expected,"The author does a good job writing about his life. However I cant assure if he is a genuine psychic.I bougth this book, very cheaply, mainly if I could learn how to be a medium. There is a short chapter where he supposely tries to teach it, but whatit teaches is a meditation that does not teach anything relevant. I felt it was just fluff."
5,"My First Time with ""One Last Time"".","My mother actually got me interested in John Edward. She told me about his show on Sci-Fi, and I watched it a few times. That's all it took, those few times, and I was hooked. When I heard about this book, I went out to get it immediately. I was not disappointed at all. It's a true page-turner... one you can not put down 'til you finish it. Whether you're a skeptic, or a believer, this book makes you see things clearly, it offers advice, gives you answers, makes you feel, and uplifts your spirits. It opens up a whole new world for the reader... one of mystery, and wonder... laughs and tears. John is a gifted Medium, he has a fabulous TV-presence, and now, he has shown us he's also a very talented writer. Very enjoyable book, and I highly recommend it to all."
5,new views on crossing over,"john is such an incredible talent. After watching his show for some time, I had to have his book. I have now read it cover to cover twice , and have such a wonderful feeling that life will not end when we die , I truly believe in god although not the christian views on god. You get such a contented feeling reading his book, and knowing that your family that has crossed over will be waiting for you when it is your time.John's ability is a gift and he explains his ability in a page turning unable to put it down style just an excellent book i look forward to more from john."
5,Could not put the book down,"This book is a must read, for anyone who has doubts about the possibilities of life after passing. I have not been able to put this book down. I only wish I could meet John Edward in person. A close family member just passed, and this is helping me to accept that he is not gone, and is still able to communicate with us."
3,I like the television show better!,"I am a pretty big fan of John Edward. But, for some reason I just can't get into any of his books. He uses the same comfortable delivery style that he uses in his television show -- but I just usually end up being bored to death.I don't think its the writing -- its me. I guess I just need the suspense of watching his readings visually.But even for a skeptic like me -- John Edward raises all the questions that you have wondered about since you were a child."
5,John Edward's integrity & compassion moved me to tears!,"Beautiful! A convincing testimony to the integrity and credibilty of the profession of Psychic Medium. But, that's not all! It's a story of love and family- not just Mr.Edward's incredible family- the families of his clients and his own compassion, dedication and enthusiasm for his God-given gift and his service to his clients. I am a believer now and a big fan of Mr.Edward. I hope he is writing more, he is a superb writer along with his other talents. I could not put this book down until the very last page."
4,HE WONDERS US!,I HAVE SEEN JOHN EDWARDS ON TV AND I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTEDON HOW HE CAN SPEAK TO OTHERS ON THE OTHER SIDE. WHILE READING THIS BOOK IT GAVE ME AN INSIGHT ON WHEN AND HOW THINGS STARTED. ITS SO AMAZING ON HOW SOME MOMENTS HE HAS COMMUNICATED WITH PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE & HE EVEN ONCE SAVE SOME GIRLS LIFE. EVERY ONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK IF YOU WANT TO LEARN ABOUT JOHN EDWARD.
5,fan of crossing over,"john is a top medium his book is like been in the show well written and a comfort to read as all the others,his personality shines in one last time,i do believe there is more, another book the calling of your true self elizabeth anne bell is another book i could not put down it also rings with truth both well worth reading"
5,Helps with grief,This book is great. It help people overcome the lose of love ones. I recommend it highly along with the book an Encounter with A Prophet.
5,A must read for anyone who has wondered about the after life,"There are few books that I have read on the subject of the afterlife that is as credible and real as ""One Last Time"". The author John Edward accomplishes this by approaching the subject from his own skeptical veiwpoint, then having to validate to himself and the reader that there is life after death. Each chapter is compelling and mind boggeling at the same time. Chapter 13 ""Andrew's Story"" will live with me forever, I have re-read this chapter 5 times. If you ever lost someone close to you and wondered ""how they are"" or ""do they see whats happening now"" and you want those assurances, then read this book, it will change your life forever."
5,Required Reading,"I think everyone should read this book. I'm half tempted to give a copy to everyone on my Christmas list this year. I don't read very often, but I couldn't put this book down. It flowed very well and I liked the way each chapter was a different story, but that it was all tied together."
5,One Last Time...One Great Book!,This book is incredible. I must say I am a little prejudiced since I just love John Edward and must watch all his shows. When I started reading this book I could not put it down. I read it and then read it again. I had to buy copies for members of my family as well. I highly recommend this book.
3,An interesting book,"This book is comforting to anyone who has recently lost a loved one. It is nice to think we may someday be with them, but I do not know if Edwards is the real deal. But I'll keep an open mind."
5,Insights Into The Other Side,"John Edward does not just teach, he shares with lovely use of humor his insights about the other side. You will be touched and reassured by his miraculous stories of spirit communication.Other recommended reading: Read Make It Happen! Use Your Intuition and Positive Spirals by medium Linda Pynaker to develop your intuition and rebuild the foundation of your life using spirituality as your platform. Unleash synchronicity to discover your purpose! Visit www.lindapynaker.com for more info."
2,Not as good as it should be,"As one who is very interested in the other side (my son is there), I have found much more comfort and satisfaction from other books of the same genre - primarily George Anderson's books. I tend to be skeptical and critical of medium abilities and was not at all impressed by the readings described in One Last Time. I've been reading at it for two months and still haven't finished the book."
3,life story,I guess I was just expecting more from the book. I read it half way and just stopped. I love John Edwards and I guess I was looking for more.
3,"Believable, Compelling","I walked by this book in the store a number of times, thinking it wouldn't interest me, until I saw the author being interviewed on TV and doing readings for call-in listeners. He is very articulate and his gift is stunning. This book is very reassuring for those of us who hold less than rigid expectations (heaven/hell) for what happens to us when this life is over. My only disappointment was that he created an expectation there would be more instruction in the book for those of us who would like to grow our psychic powers than there actually was."
4,Couldn't put it down,"I am a fan of John Edward's new show on the Sci Fi Channel, so I was eager to read this book. While I was hoping to hear more about how to develop one's own ability to ""tune into"" messages from the Other Side, I couldn't put this book down until I had read every page. The stories are very compelling and I was completely engrossed in this book. I look forward to reading Mr. Edward's other book and also want to have a reading of my own now."
5,Gives Me Hope,"If nothing else,this book has given me hope that there is another life after our departure on earth.John gives such detail to each person's personal experience with their loved ones that I cannot imagine he is a fake.I love this book and I respect and admire the work that he does.If this were truely the devil's work,the devil has set himself up.If anything,I would tend to live my life just that much better(not evil)just knowing that we REALLY do have a life after this one on earth.Hardly the work of the devil."
1,A Pitiful Scam,"It seems quite unbelievable with the good, credible information offered by science that people are still taken by those such as Edward, who make a living by preying on the grieving and the gullible. I do not blame his followers, as the vulnerability of the bereaved is apparent. But to claim to channel even pets! Please! Such obvious pandering is a scam, pure and simple. Edward does tricks that are easy to understand, and even perform. Look, for example, at the work of James Randi. Edward will claim that he is only offering comfort through the use of his ""gift."" In reality, he is practicing the worst sort of opportunism to coldly separate the grieving and the gullible from their money. If this is a ""gift,"" why does he charge for it? And how have Americans gotten so far from critical thinking that they cannot see through the most transparent huckster?"
2,NEEDS TRAINING IN HIS WORK!,"I FEEL JOHN EDWARD'S BOOK ""ONE LAST TIME"" DIDN'T CUT IT FOR ME.I'VE ALSO WATCHED HIS LIVE PERFORMANCES ON TELEVISION AND FIND HE RUSHES HIS CLAIRVOYANCE WHEN GIVING PUBLIC DEMONSTRATIONS. IN MY OPINION HE NEEDS SOME PERSONAL COACHING, ON HOW TO DELIVER HIS MESSAGES FROM THE SPIRIT WORLD. HE ALSO ASKS FAR TOO MANY QUESTIONS -NOT GOOD FOR THE SCEPTICS THAT LINE UP IN THE WINGS TO TRY AND DISPROVE A PYSCHIC'S WORK.I'D LIKE TO SEE JENNY CRAWFORD - AUTHOR OF ""THROUGH THE EYES OF SPIRIT"", WORK WITH JOHN EDWARD - SHE WOULD SOFTEN HIS ACT A BIT."
1,Totally absurd,"Mr. Edwards is just another guru for the gullible, a la Shirley Maclaine. Wise up, people, this book is for fools. Mr. Edwards just says things that we want to hear and that we wish were true. For a revealing and intelligent look at the psychology of those poor souls who need comfort by believing in the paranormal, read Carl Sagan's ""The Demon Haunted World""."
3,The World of the Occult,"John Edwards even admits in his book that his communication with the dead is indirect. He describes several spirit mediums in his book that he saw through a meditation that act as spirit mediums or middlemen for the dead to communicate there message across to John. These are flat out demons! This is a way for the Devil of enticing people to get more deeply involved into other occult practices such as Ougi boards, seances, etc . Ultimately these practices leaves people's minds more open to demonic possession which is a total enslavement of an individual by demons. For all you Christians who don't find anything wrong with this, shame on you for your lack of perservance and faith in the Holy Spirit! Don't you realize that the Scriptures prohibit this?"
5,John Edward's book talks to you.,"This book is exactly like being at a John Edward seminar. It is written in simple form, just as if he was speaking before you telling the story. He relays how he began with unusual experiences as a child until his revelation that this is his life's mission.The experiences of those that come in contact with him are moving. This was a great read. It may make a believer out of you."
4,A medium like me,"As a Long Islander, Medium, Catholic and author I can relate so deeply to John and his message. He transcends religion and approaches the spirituality that encompasses us all on a universal level - both here on this earth and beyond. He is not only believable, but having lived a similar life, can attest to receiving messages in the same way. This gift is to be shared via the media or in person. I applaud John for allowing his readers to glimpse into his life and perhaps bring a piece of that with them as they move on their own journeys. Bravo.Anna L. Raimondiauthor: Talking to the Dead in Suburbia - An Ordinary Woman with an Extraordinary Gift"
4,great books,"I love this book and bought copies for my book group! All arrived in very good condition, one was even signed by the author. Delighted!"
5,Thank you Mr. Edward,"I have read several books by several claimed psychic mediums and I have found there are only a few that are believable and Mr. Edward is among the top two of my favorites. His honesty and down to earthness comforted me in letting me know that there is more to life after here and that the person who I lost is safe and continuing to ""live"" on with us. if for nothing else I found great comfort and a sense of peace in One Last Time. I can't thank Mr.Edward enough."
1,Disappointing book,"I read this book with the high hopes of really understanding what the dead have to say about the important things we must deal with here, but all this book brings is just more conveniently edited readings. The readings seem wonderful, but when I saw Mr. Edward in a seminar in Las Vegas, it was nothing close to the perfect readings in the book. It left me so disappointed."
1,Don't waste your money by giving him more,"The first few times I watched John Edward's show I was entralled with hope & happiness. As a result I became hooked on his show & watched it at every opportunity. I began to notice John's technique & became very disappointed. He begins very vague & then narrows it down by people's responses & facial expressions. To see if I was right I got together some of my neighbors whom I do not know their ""deceased"" family/friend backgrounds. I began just as John did very vague. ""I'm getting a mother figure over here somewhere"" etc... I amazed my neighbors. They thought I was physic by the end of our ""session"". I then let them in on my experiment & they were astonished. The moral of this is to not be so easily fooled by what we hope & long for. If you want to buy a reliable spiritual book then buy the Holy Bible!"
1,Adorno Hates You!,"John Edward gives people exactly what he wants to here. He's like a politician with a campaign speech, if people don't respond to his rants like he wants, he pretends he never said the thing they ignore. If a politician feels a stance of his isn't giving them the response they want, they drop for something that will give them more votes, i.e. audience memebers. Giving people a false sense of hope through the use of vague statements and an understanding of human nature is a vile thing to do. Buts its the people who buy the books and watch the show that I really feel sorry for. Edward is a sideshow proprietor. He draws people in with a shrewd business sense and a gimmick, the two-headed fetus being his 'gift'. End of story."
1,i got sucked in !!!!!!!!!,"i am so disappointed in myself, i got sucked in by all the good reviews. could not imagine that there was so many gullible people. its sad, really, that humans will believe anything to relieve themselves of pain..."
3,Extraordinary versatility in a public figure,"I am deeply impressed with the breadth and depth of Mr. Edwards' accomplishments. It's probably no coincidence that someone who demonstrates such a remarkable sensitivity to the needs or our bereaved citizenry should--as junior senator from North Carolina--also be shortlisted for consideration as a Democratic vice-presidential candidate. Like the American flag he serves with such versatility, long may he wave!"
2,just don't expect too much from this book,"John Edwards has undoubtedly an otherworthly ""in"", however, there is no substance to the book. He REPEATS HIS experiences as he channels them through his guides for the duration of the book. I can recommend the book to people who have absolutely NO spiritual connection whatsoever, however, for those who are already convinced that there is a 'connection', you won't need to read his book. John Edward has also some outrageous charges for his services, which leads me to believe that he's priced the little budgetted person out of his office and leads me to thinking, ""how spiritual is that?"" Peace....."
5,My Favorite JB Comp,"This is just so damn good! This has been my favorite JB compilation since it originally came out. I cannot add much to what has already been said. So many good cuts here, the highlight is to have the Big Band sides that were originally on the LP ""Showtime"", with all the dubbed in crowd noise removed. Two highlights from that session include Louis Jordan's hits: ""Caledonia"" & ""Aint Nobody here but us Chickens"". Also there are some wonderful unissued sides particularly the talking blues ""Like It Is,Like It Was"" where James name drops all his musical heroes. His high energy soul sides need a certain party mood to put on, while this compilation you can listen to anytime, Blues, Big Band Jump, Ballads... he could do it all, what genius!!"
4,"Josh from Connecticut, April 15, 2000","If you like basketball or ever have had to deal with racism, you'll like this book. Mel Johnson moves to an all white neighborhood and school. He joins the school basketball team and most of the players won't even pass the ball to him because he is black. When one of the other players falls through the ice and Mel helps to save his life, things turn around. From that point on they start to play as a team and realize that no matter what color you are ""The Basket Counts"" This book is very easy to read...if you're like me and would rather be playing basketball than reading about it!"
3,mark's review,"I liked this book because it had non-stop basketball and lots of action. I also liked how everyone started to come together as a team in the end of the season and how well they did.This book is about a great basketball team called the Titans. Mel, a new kid in town, tries out for the team and makes it. Two players, Caskie and Stony, don't like him at all because he is black. Caskie would call Mel nasty names on the court. One day Mel had it. He charged at Caskie as hard as he could just about to punch him but then the refs broke up the fight. At the second half of the year, Mel and Caskie really started to come together and so did the team winning every single game in the second half of the season.I would recommend this book to someone who loves basketball and likes a book with lots of action."
3,Ok book,"This book is ok, but not what I thought it would be. While the book does have some handy things in it, a lot of the book is dedicated to word games, stories, and songs. I think the price is a little high for this book, also. If it is offered at around $8, it would be worth it."
4,Bleed black label !!!!!,"I realy enjoyed this CD I enjoyed disc 2 the most. I only had two complaints , one was it's almost all Stronger Than Death songs and it's missing the best song on there Counterfit God. Other than that it is an excelent CD. If you like zack's music you'l love this cd."
4,WHAT YOU HEAR IS WHAT YOU SEE...,I'd seen Zakk and BLS show somewhere in Holland and they're really amazing. Listening to this CD is exactly sound the same as you them live (except I don't hear any sound of Zakk's trademark spittin'). I really recommended this album for you all heavy guitar riff fans.
2,Second Class Offering,"BLS are a great live group, but you wouldn't know it listening to this record. The mix is so poorly done that all of the power of the music is lost. Zakk's guitar is mixed dead center, while the second guitist is buried in the backround. The drums also have no punch.BLS's excellent live DVD (Boozed Bruised and Broken-Boned) solved this problem by using the AC/DC guitar mix of having each guitarist hard mixed to the right and left channel with well recorded drums. I would buy that DVD before this CD if you want to see the real power of a BLS live show."
4,F&%$EN BLEED BLACK LABEL,"Concidering how many concerts BLS has out on CD (ONE) this is a very good buy. Yes there are some Sabbath remakes, but they're pretty decent. Concidering its Zakk's killer guitar methods replacing Tony Iommi's. Zakks AWESOME use of something us guitarists call ""pinch Harmonics or Wylde Harmonics"" is great and plenty of. since Zakk Wylde made them so famous and to qoute Zakk from one of the live songs. on track six. ""Limp Bizket SUCKS D*CK!"""
3,Excellent service,"I bought the book for class. I am still reading it. Although some times it seems to drag on, it is excellent for learning about the basics of programming languages. The chapter about parsing seem to be a bit confusing at times. I had to re-read it few times to have a complete understanding; however, over all it seems an good resource.I like more detailed graphs, tables and pictures in text books, which this book lacks."
3,"Good, but I wish it covered more language theory","This book was good for my undergrad programming-languages class, but it didn't help us in our study of attribute grammers, nor was the explanation and examples of BNF and EBNF as extensive as they could have been. Also I was dissapointed the examples as they were all very simple (see Chapter 3's section on Denotational Semantics).It is true that it says some silly stuff about Java - but that seems to be pretty typical of most text books these days."
3,Good book,"This is very interesting book in which you can find interesting information about history of programming languages, as well as most relevant consepts used for building language compilers.The problem of this book is not in the matter that is presented in the book, but in the way it is presented. The biggest problem is in the typos and mistakes made in the text. It is strange that this 6th edition of the book contains so many typos and mistakes.Regardless the drawbacks that are said before, I recomand this book for buying. Anyone who is interested in programmming and programming languages will surely find interesting information in this book."
4,A nice book,"This is a nice book, though I got a C in the programming language course. Now who want a used book?"
2,Worthless,"I had to purchase this book for a class that dealt with programming languages and was thoroughly disappointed. I'd like to preface this review by saying we only covered 5 chapters from this book so those are what the review is based on. First let me say this book does cover a lot of topics but none of them really in depth or to any degree. Second Sebesta please non one programs in Ada or PL1 anymore we can stop referencing them that are legacy languages . I just feel like he offers poor explanations to critical topics, like Context Free Grammars are glossed over without much care. If your using this for self study I'd look for something else."
4,Too much Ada and Pascal,"The concepts were described pretty well but there was too much emphasis on useless programmming languages. Although I realize this is a book on computer programming, they could have tried to make it a little more colorful. A mug shot of dorky computer scientists at the beginning of each chapter is not my idea of effective visual aid."
2,Not an introductory text,"I used this book for a introductory course to graduate students that had no programming experience. This book was not set up for introductory students. You really need to have expericence with programming languages, especially C and Pascal to make heads or tails of this book.I didn't like the layout...spending the first part of the book telling you what it is going to talk about, and then spending the second part retelling you. In some cases, in exactly the same words....the organization needs some work and the index and glossary were not thorough enough to be of help. I ended up buying two other books on programming languages to help explain this one to me so I could finish the course.The review questions did nothing to prepare you for the problem sets at the end of each chapter and the problem sets didn't really have examples in the text that you could refer back to. Like I said, it seemed that the book expected you to know more than introductory level."
4,It's readable!!,"I'm a student who studying a computer education in korea. I'm not good at English... But this book was very easy and readable. Statement clearly written. So easy to understand!! It gives me to have a wide scope about the programming language. It was interesting. This book is somethig like a novel. But It is insufficient for current used popular language somethig like java, php...etc"
2,Moderately useful....,"I am using this book for a programming languages course and find it only slightly useful. It places rather too much emphasis on high-level explanations and history of programming languages, and may be of limited use to people who want to get a deeper understanding of the mechanics of designing a language/compiler. The book is clearly sectioned but each section seems to ramble on without a clear focus of where the discussion will lead. Some exercises, especially the ones on evolution of programming languages, seem contrived. There is also a conspicuous absence of regular expressions/automata which is also important to understanding programming languages"
5,The best programming language book,"and one of the best computer science books in general. It is very well written and organized, and doesn't get bogged down in minor details and extra information. It gets straight to the point, unlike another programming language book by Ravhi Sethi. The Ravi Sethi book probably has more information, but it's EXTREMELY poorly written/organized and bogged down with useless extra information (I think he just did that to seem smarter than he really is). I learned 5 times as much reading this book, while spending 1/5 of the time reading it (as compared with Sethi's book).TO ALL COLLEGE PROFESSORS: PLEASE CHOOSE THIS BOOK IN YOUR PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE CLASS, NOT RAVI SETHI'S. PLEASE!!!"
1,2nd rate chase game with SpongBob painted on,"My 8-yr-old son and I played it. (We both have played a lot on the Wii with the standard games that came free with the Wii which my son and I have mastered).He spent 20 minutes trying to get control of the vehicle in this SpongeBob game. Very difficult to get through course without crashing. Felt like car randomly crashed. Weak graphics. Felt like a basic cheap game with SpongeBob stuck on top of it sloppily to make it sell.After 20 minutes of boredom and frustration, we went back to games that came with the Wii free of charge which we both felt were far superior.This SpongeBob game lets the Wii down. Both my son and I were very disappointed."
3,Frustrating as you get farther along,The lower levels are pretty easy and lots of fun. As you get farther along the levels get more difficult. I don't play it very much anymore except on the free play levels. It is a good game for older kids than for younger kids.
2,"Seems like there is potential, but really hard start up","This game is really, really hard to start up. It seems that you have to move from game to game in ""story mode"" in order to get access to each game. My 8 year old - a very experienced gamer, who has spent hours on the wii sports games - was in tears several times trying to make his way through the first two games. The driving part in the first game ""Diesel Dreams"" is frankly beyond the skill base of a child. I finally took over and got us through that. As I write he is trying to ""find Spongebob's license"" and having lots of difficulty executing the jumps, etc.This is not a game for a child..."
4,Easy fun,"Until I learned the right way to hold the remote for racing I was frustrated. The game is pretty easy and I think that children will enjoy it. I enjoy it when I'm in the mood for mindless fun. I do wish you should change the point of view by pushing the ""Z"" button like you can with Zelda."
4,Fun Game,I bought this game for my 7 year old son. He likes it. It's fun and mostly easy for him to play. There are few spots where he gets frustrated and I have to help him.
4,Only listened to 'I Quit',I haven't actually purchased the single but after listening to them on BUffy the Vampire Slayer soundtrack I thought they were excellent! I Quit has a pop like genre but maybe soem of they're other songs could pull them back into alternativeness.
4,awesome,I heard this song on my local radio station and loved it immediately. The song is very upbeat and has a tendency to make you sing along with it. I can't find any websites over this group so I guess they are just barely getting famous in the U.S. I don't think they will be unknown for long with their being on the Buffy Soundtrack!!! Hepburn rocks!!!
5,Braverman Rocks Oceans in Palm Latitudes,"It is indeed a shame that Kate Braverman's novelsremain out of print. In Palm Latitudes, Bravermanweaves a tale pregnant with imagery and humanity. It is the story of several women who are at similar precipices in their life; and in Braverman's world of Los Angeles, it is the women who are simultaneously enlightened by the textures of existence and caged by their men and their sex. A powerful novel with an equally engaging sense of feminism, Palm Latitudes examines men, women and culture with a startlingly microscopic and perceptive lens."
5,beautiful book!,"I collect handkercheifs, and it was great to find a book about them, especially one as pretty as this!Thanks so much, I love it!"
2,Out of date at this moment,"At this moment this book is a way a out of time, simply because it covers narrowband technologies like GSM, IS-95 and others that are no longer interesting for fixed wireless access systems realization. More attractive standard as IEEE 802.16 have been covered on 2 pages, and WiMAX Forum has not been mentioned at all. Also, there is no mathematical background or practical FWA system planning background. This is completely introductory book that could not be interested to anyone with high or moderate involvement in field of telecommunications. If you are a part of a management and you are trying just to get an idea about fixed wireless access this book can be interesting, in all other cases not very much. I believe that for engineers Harry Andersons book about fixed wireless access is much more valuable, and for managers William Webbs book about wireless local loops."
1,horrible,well its extreemley old at this point soo buying wud b pointless it has a slow framerate and is just bad
3,it boots me sometimes,I have Windows XP and sometimes when i turn it on it boots me and sometimes when its on it boots me
4,Impressive remix by Genaside,"In my opinion one of the better tracks ever to come from Tricky, and definetly the best one of the album Juxtapose. However the number one reason to pick this CD up would be Brixton-based beatsquad Genaside II's remix of For Real. Amazing stuff."
4,Hip Hop Man,How can some of you think this is not a good album. Its Very good. You must not listen to hip hop. I think the best track is ''Live and die for hip hop'' the is some real west coast s****!!! Kris kross are true Legends
1,Seriously?,"I've never really had any respect for ""emcees"" who don't write their own rhymes. Ridiculous.Jermaine Dupri gets 1 star because his production on this album was solid as usual."
1,honest,"I saw them on tv totally dissing artists cause they had a cd coming out. They were like such and such oh whatever happened to them. We still here. We still selling albums they aint got nothing on us, and ha now where is Kris kross? They are so corny and so arrogant. I'm glad they disappeared."
5,Great,"Love the book and service from the sender. Book in good shape.Have nothing else to say, please let me go to the next page, i appreciate it. Thanks"
1,"MS ""cure"" books","There have been many claims by people who have claimed to have cured, erased or eradicated their MS symptoms, they sell you a book $$$ you apply their principles yet you still have MS, how many of us have ordered a book followed it to the letter and got no results ? Probably most of us, if there was a cure for MS, someone on the internet would know about it. They prey on our fears and in our situation we are so desperate we will try or do anything, only to feel more desperate and helpless for this dreaded thing they call MS, however when we hear something new or there is a new book or protocol out that we haven't heard about by someone who claims to have cured themselves, we will jump right in and the vicious cruel cycle will start over again."
1,This is the most irresponsible book on MS I've ever read,"This book starts with the author's self-aggrandizing about the medical knowledge she possesses as a chiropractor and nturionist. But the book is riddled with inaccuracies, uneducated statements and pseudo-scientific myth. I would HATE for anyone newly diagnosed with MS to read this book and draw any conclusions from it. I cannot believe no one from her publishing house saw fit to do any actual fact checking on this book. Some of the unsafe and unscienfitic methods she espouses - bee sting therapy and removing the fillings from your teeth. I could not believe the publication date on this book was from anytime in the last decade when so much proven, scientific data about MS has been published, and so many dangerous ""cures"" debunked."
1,Oxygen up your what?!,"This book is mostly a long-winded autobiography of Celeste Pepe. She constantly reminds the reader that she is rich, a nutritionist (who,incidentally, was ""out of balance""), and married to a very wealthy, handsome man, who was in complete denial and not much help to her. It appears she believes she was re-incarnated and chose to have MS in a previous life so that she could save the rest of the world with vitamins, bee-stings and oxygen blown through every bodily opening! How is that even accomplished? As a person with recently diagnosed MS, this book was not in the least bit helpful. No one should take any advice from her at all and I don't think going to her as a chiroprator would be such a great idea either."
2,ok,"as a professor of neuropsychiatry AND someone who suffers from MS, i found this book to be okay. it discusses some of the alternative methods for the treatment of MS that have been used and are presently in use. she offers some evidence, both objective and subjective, in support of her claims. the writing is relatively easy to follow. She uses fairly short sentences. It pulls the reader in at times, but, with equal energy, it pushes or repulses you away. i was quite disappointed overall with the book, hoping that it would be both more descriptive and scholarly. i would not recommend this book for use in the classroom, for ""primary care providers"", or for those with MS."
2,Not realistic,Halfway through the book I gave up - I don't need to read about how everyone thought she looked wonderful and how did she have MS ?? - I've been living with it for 35 years - this book is for those newly diagnosed who are going through the denial phase - not relevant for me although I should have realized that before I purchased it - there is no reversing MS - there are remissions but no reversals and to think that there are is a fallacy -
1,CAUTION!,"As an RN that has had MS for 19 years, I found this book to be very amusing! I imagine that if every person that had MS also had a housekeeper, a cook, and a chauffeur, we would all be doing better too. It is very unrealistic that us common folk would have the money to undergo the therapies that she has. There really is such a thing as remission. Please do not think that this book is going to tell you 9 simple steps to recovery, because it doesn't!"
1,no color,"I was VERY dissapointed to receive this item. All of the pages are in black and white, and there is no explination or direction on how to design illuminated letters. It was not at all what I was hoping for."
5,good reference tool,I will be teaching illuminated letteres to children and wanted some ideas for them to look at. It will be a good reference tool for that.
1,Piece of Junk,"Okay, this thing worked for maybe 5 minutes, literally. Then it broke and was unrepairable. WASTE OF MONEY. Barbie brand toys are always made cheaply but this is the worst I've seen so far."
4,Great cookies for my allergic son!,We recently found out that my 3 year old son is allergic to gluten and casein and these cookies have been a lifesaver! My son has a big sweet tooth and these hit the spot for him. They have a great taste and he requests at least two every day. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is because the texture is a little different for my taste... but it doesn't bother my son at all and that is all that matters! Thank you Enjoy Life for creating such a great product!!!
5,Very satisfying,"I enjoy a chewy cookie, so I unwrap them and dry a bit. I pair them with nuts for breakfast, or with a glass of milk for dessert. They are very good."
5,it's party time for kids with severe allergies!,"i have a child with very severe allergies(anaphylactic to wheat, gluten, dairy, nuts and peanuts, sesame seeds, soy, eggs etc, well you get the idea)it was just a couple of month ago that he was able to eat the snicker doodle cookies by enjoy life. We've have few years of experimental baking to meet his diet at home. I have to say I won't even eat the stuff I baked for him.the snicker doodles were a big hit! I often take them to play dates, park, parties etc and often share with kids who has no allergies and they seem to like them too!This individual packages only contains 2 cookies thus it is so much easier to toss them in a bag for an outing.this cookies have made my life so much easier!!!if you have a child with many allergies and haven't found treats that is safe, you must try this!!"
5,My daughter loves these!,"My daughter who is allergic to wheat, milk and eggs loves these cookies. When we are eating out and she can not have the food we have, I usually feed her meal before we go the restaurant and then she enjoys 1 or 2 of these cookies while we are having our meal. That way she is having something special and we get to eat out too without feeling bad that she is left out."
5,Recommended Cookies,"Its sometimes hard to find decent gluten-free cookies that don't taste grainy or are too dry. This is one of the good ones. Not only are the cookies soft, but the texture is close to the ""real thing"" and, if you didn't tell people, they'd probably never know they were gluten-free.However, if you expect them to taste exactly like a home-made snickerdoodle cookie, you will be disappointed. They don't taste like a real snickerdoodle, but they do taste yummy all the same.The cookies are little, but for a small snack or for putting out on a snack table for a party, they are just the right size. Baking your own gluten-free goodies is often the best option, but not always the easiest. For something pre-packaged, these cookies (and the other flavors by the same maker) are a good choice."
5,Taste like the 'real' thing!,"My five year old son has just been diagnosed with egg, milk, and chocolate allergies. He is now very limited in the items he can eat and had already aquired a taste for foods that are usually cooked with eggs and milk. We haved tried a few allergy friendly recipes and products and they tasted completely different that what he was used to. The ""Enjoy Life Snickerdoodle cookies"" are one of the few things he can eat and actually loves! I am a very picky eater, but tasted one and it was delicious! I am thankful that we have found a product that not only happens to be allergy free...but is actually tasty too!"
1,no oats oatmeal enjoy life cookies,"These are horrible, kinda sticky, with a sugar substitute after taste too. Nutritional info on Amazon was different from that on box and manufacturers website, supposedly because manufacturer had changed cookie recipe. I won't recommend this product. I also notified manufacturer through their facebook page, and they notified me that they had changed their recipe supposedly. First time I tried their product, but I'm never buying again. I do highly recommend, Kashi Dark Chocolate Oatmeal Wholegrain Cookies though. These are divine, and a ""God Send."" Thanks..."
1,False Advertisement,"I am pretty active in health food, conscious social circles. Buying these types of foods and supporting alternative business is important to me. HOWEVER, this company consistently markets their products in HUGE boxes with tiny cookies or bars. I think the cookies are okay, but I feel this company knowingly deceives their customers by making the product look bigger. My husband and I actually laughed when we saw how tiny these things are. Regardless of how much value you get when you buy a box (Very little in my opinion), wasting massive amounts of packaging is inconsistent with the earth conscious advertisement on the package. For that reason alone, I will not buy these again."
2,tiny tiny cookies,I actually bought a couple of 2-packs from a local retailer. But I was very disappointed to find out that the 2 cookies are small. Too small in my opinion. If your looking for a decent 2-pack check out Pamela's instead. As far as taste is concerned I was not impressed. The small size could have been tolerated if the flavor was better.
2,Not so great flavor!,Not so great Lemon flavor!It's Very hard to find Soy free!This is a great Brand! I prefer the ginger much better taste!
5,gluten free cookies,"This cookie is soft, chewy, spicy and tasty. One of the few products without chocolate that is really good. One of the best things about Enjoy Life Cookies is I don't have to worry about any of the secondary intolerance's that is so common in people with Celiac disease. So many of the non-gluten chocolate sweets are so disgustingly over chocolate, it is nice to have a tasty cookie without.Enjoy Life Soft Baked Snickerdoodle Cookies, 6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)"
5,I LOVE Snickerdoodles!,"I love these cookies! They are a bit doughey, but then I like them that way. The taste is marvelous!"
2,blech,These are pretty terrible. Do yourself a favor and use some gluten free flour to make snickerdoodles yourself.
2,I really wanted to like them but...,"We know a lot about gluten free products in my house, and we've tried a lot of GF cookies. I really wanted to like these but I've had many better products before. I was turned off by the texture and the taste."
3,Disappointed in change,Very disappointed they no longer have the Vegan certification. I believe this is across the board with all their products (it's because they can't verify the sugar source). The product information on Amazon needs to be changed to show it's no longer Vegan certified.
2,"not too yummy, unfortunately...","I bought the ginger and apple cookies and they were 95% identical. The apple cookies just had some shreds of the apple. I didn't enjoy either the texture or flavor much but learnt that if you leave the cookie out, it dries up and gets a little better (to my taste). It's a fair try but I will not buy these again. Now I just have to invite many many guests over for tea to feed off the loads of these ginger and apple cookies I got :)))"
3,Reprise of others,"For $15, this is a pretty good intro to both Dr Zahi Hawass and Egyptology.For the most part, Dr Hawass does an introduction of the material for that episode, then another subject matter expert takes over. I felt as if I had seen a good bit of the film in previous documentaries abt ancient Egypt. So, if you are a documentary ""junkie,"" this is not the documentary for you.If you are new to documentaries or just want to show the kids some facet of Egyptology, then this is a value-priced set just for that purpose."
4,NOT HD,"Sadly the videos aren't by any means HD...the info is misleading..anyway, I enjoyed the different chapters a lot..but no HD I was truly disappointed.."
5,nice set for the price.,"my wife loves egypt docs, so i picked this up for here. great quality, super value, and for the price cant be beat. If you want to get started on this very well trodden path, start here, youll love it."
1,Good product but poor seller service,"The product is good. However, the seller did NOT provide the needed memory card or connectivity cable (to the computer) which are integral parts of the camera. Additionally, the battery was bloated and at the very end of its life."
3,"Great camera, could be more reliable...","Giving it 3 stars because it works really well and takes great pictures but the reliability is poor. I have had to have this camera replaced twice (I got my moneys worth from the purchased guarantee). The button you press to take pictures just stopped working and I had to send it back. Then the LCD display went all red on one side. However, 3rd time lucky, it works great - takes excellent pictures without having to be a photography expert. I originally bought it for my mom but it is too small for her to use so I ended up with it. If you buy one, buy a store guarantee."
1,Great camera if you can afford one a year,"I got this sd400 to replace my s400 which after a year started giving me a memory card error message. I now find out that was a design flaw. Anyway, i spent hundreds of dollars on this one, and now, just over a year after I got it, it won't hold a battery charge. I loved both cameras while they worked, but I can't afford a $400 camera plus the related accessories every year or so. I've written to Canon tech support. Unless they are willing to repair or replace this one free of charge, I'm moving on to another brand camera!"
3,"Nice feel, nice features BUT.......","Love my Canon G3. Wanted a smaller ""point and shoot"" that I could carry around with me everywhere I go. Tried out the SD400. Was stunned by the quality of the pictures.....vastly inferior to my G3 or Fuji 4700 (which I'd given to my wife). Am going to purchase the Casio Z750 instead. Was very disappointed with the SD400.."
4,"great camera, great price","this is totally worth the money. you can't get a camera of this quality in it's category for this price. My only complaint about it is the opening where you plug the cable into the camera to connect to your computer. It's really hard to open and really flimsy, so be careful. I ended up buying a separate USB card reader so I don't have to worry about it anymore. I would also be careful opening the compartment that holds the battery/memory. The flap is plastic and seems easily breakable.All in all, no regrets. I'm happy with it for what I paid!"
4,Quite happy about it,"I'm quite happy that I bought this camera. It takes nice crispy pictures and it's very intuitive to use. It has some very good modes like 'Against twilight' and 'kids and pets' to use. Contrary to some other users comments I found the flash pretty powerful and helps the shooting a lot. Well.. but i'm not a professional photographer. The CONS are probably that it it doesnt show battery status and it's your guess when it'll run out. Also I donno if it's normal but the camera gets hot pretty quick after taking 10 or more pictures. In dark background the pictures tend to be blur with even very slight shake, but this is a common problem with all cameras."
2,Great Camera lousy LCD,This camera takes great pictures and is easy to use right out of the vox. Unfortunaely the LCD onthe bac of the camera stopped working after one week of use.
1,Canon SD400 - Rated 1 Star!,"Out of the box, this camera jammed and the lens no longer closes. The same thing happened to my brother's camera (SD500) which was about 2 months old. The good news is that Canon offers a 1 year warranty on this type of problem (common failure among Canon digital cameras). The bad news (disappointing news) is that they haven't yet fixed this problem. Just be careful when you buy a Canon SD series camera and do lots of research before taking the 300-500$ plunge."
3,Different LCD Problem,"Mine didn't crack. Better yet, less than two months after buying it, the screen went white! I didn't drop or bump it. It was in my hand the entire time. I shut it off to save power and when I turned it back on, no functioning LCD screen.Mind you, the view finder is working, but I can't change any settings, can't see the shot's I've already taken, nor can I shut off the LCD power to save the battery.Must say that I am a little disappointed in Canon. However, I am getting it replaced (thanks, Amazon!) and am willing to try again. My friends have had no problems with their SD series, so I hope this was a most unfortunate fluke.Otherwise, its a cute, small camera that takes great pictures and video.I'll let you know if the replacement is just as much of a bummer as the first one I bought in November."
2,very disappointed...,"I had canon digital camera since their first serie. my last one was S30. I recently bought SD400. almost none of my pictures at night are focused. my daytime pictures are just okay. the camera is fast to load, to take pix, and has nice menu system and absolutely compact. but the quality is unacceptable. only pictures of a sunny california day appear flawless. the rest are just bad. i wouldn't suggest this camera. in fact it might be my camera! i'm going to retunrn it to canon for a checkup."
3,Fuzzy close-up quality,"Like the size of camera and the quick response, but the quality of picutres is not as good as the Sony I have. The close-ups are not as clear."
2,Dark around corners,"For indoor shots, I consistently see dark spots around the corners.The picture quality is bad. To save yourself some frustration, avoid this camera."
5,SD400 Digital Elph,This camera was extraordinarily easy to use. I took several hundred pictures on a cross country road trip. I was impressed at how quickly the camera turned on and was ready to use. I captured several roadside attractions as we drove on by. Amazing.
1,SD card locked,"Used the camera for a while, but now it displays ""memory card locked"" ...about to throw this brick of a camera against the wall"
1,Bad choice!,"The only good thing about this camera is its looks and macro performance.It produces pictures that are out of focus and extremely, extremely noisy (fringing is unbereable). Anything taken with ISO above 50 is useless.Battery life is minimal.I have several Canon cameras and have used their products for a long time but this one is a big dissapointement.Canon repair and support is useless when it comes to SD 400.Stay away from it!"
1,"Great camera, terrible reliability","After waiting several months diligently reviewing the digital cameras available in the marketplace, I finally purchased the SD400 near the end of May. Initially, I was very happy with this camera - it seems to have the perfect combination of size, picture quality, and battery life. Unfortunately, the LCD screen on my camera cracked just a couple weeks ago, even though I've always kept the camera in its protective case. I was upset with myself, because I felt that perhaps I must have damaged it somehow, but a little research on the internet (enter ""canon cracked lcd"" into any search engine) indicates that this is a design flaw with the entire Canon SD series. Even worse, Canon refuses to acknowledge this as a real issue and continues to fight every customer who tries to claim a warranty repair, claiming that they must have damaged the camera somehow. Until Canon improves their product or customer service, I would recommend buying another camera."
5,Canon is the best when it comes to digital Cameras,This camera is awesome. I love the compact size and ease of use. I am not one for gadgets but this camera is so easy to use even I (remote control challenged) could figure it out. I love the large display for the small size of the camera. The download button is a snap to use and Canon's software does wonders for photo organization. I would recommend this camera to everyone. From first time digital user to digital pro the performance and size just can't be beat. I take it everywhere and you should too.
3,Fine if you don't need more than a gig of space...,"This camera would easily earn 5 stars except for the fact that it is incompatible with certain SD memory cards. I bought a 4GB high speed card that works great in my cheap Nikon, but this camera informs me that there is a ""memory card error"" and that the card is locked. I called support, and the man informed me that my card had not been tested with the camera. When I asked for a list of cards that had been tested, he told me to check Google!If you don't need as much capacity, I had great luck with this camera and a high speed 1 Gig card. Be warned of 'incompatibility' issues and incompetent support."
2,Lens Issues,"Sensitive lens mechanism rendered entire camera useless. Common problem, more costly than replacement. Would not buy again."
1,"One a year replacement, really.","I NEVER write reviews but if I can stop someone from buying this camera here it goes. I like this camera however it really breaks after one year. My first one the button you press down to take pictures popped off. Luckily I have a relative that works where I purchased it so I didn't have to go through Canon directly. Well I'm about to hit the one year mark on the new one 7/2/07 and sure enough the lens no longer opens and come out which happened during a vacation in Key West. Once again I called my relative and will be getting a new one. However, save yourself the headache get a different brand."
5,canon sd400,Excellent camera. Takes wonderful pictures and the size is great to keep in pocket or purse
4,Not quite point and shoot...,This is a great camera. I particularly appreciate the small size. The fact that it can fit in pocket makes it very simple to bring almost anywhere. The speed of the camera to turn on and take a picture is one of the most compelling reason to purchase this camera.
4,"Good Product, Fast Shipping","I was extremely pleased with this item. It arrived very fast. I am a novice photographer at best, and my main concern was to find a digital camera small enough to fit in my purse. Even in its case, this camera is extremely small. I am very pleased with this purchase. It has worked well."
4,It's just OK. Not great.,"What I like:- Video (movie) mode is very good. 640x480x30 movies arevery clear. Better than my friend's Sony camera's movie.- Very small. It is probably one of the smallest 5MP camera.- Transfer to computer via USB 2.0 is very fast. (I justuse the Window XP Photo Wizard program. I did not installany software that comes with the camera.)What I do not like:- Still picture is not as sharp as my old Canon S410 4MPcamera.- Still pictures looks great in bright sunlight/outdoorconditions. Focus much slower in slightly darker conditions.- Camera gets warm after a little while. The camera (andthe chips inside) are not hot, but it is uncomfortable tohave warm metal in your hand."
5,"Small camera, great pictures and Canon quality","The SD400 is an outstanding point and shoot digital camera for the average to slightly tech-inclined photographer.I previously had an S500 which was a great camera. So far, the SD400 seems to improve on the S500 in every way. It has nice and large LCD screen. Unlike some of the other smaller cameras, it also has a traditional viewfinder. The most striking feature of the camera is its small size. It fits in a pocket perfectly and is smaller than my flip phone. The time from powering up to taking pictures is ridiculously fast.The pictures are great and the camera is easy to use. Some may complain that this camera lacks features. However, for the average person who just wants to take everyday pictures, it's great. So far, no complaints about this one. The flash lights up a completely dark room w/ no problem. I have no qualms about recommending this camera to anyone looking to pick up a quality digital point and shoot camera."
3,"OK in bright light, horrible in low-light conditions","Bought this camera to replace an aging Canon Powershot S300 that took much better pictures in low light than the SD400 did. The SD400 produced good shots outdoors in bright light, but images taken in the shadows or indoors without flash had a large amount of ""noise"" that made them look extremely grainy. Focus wasn't the issue, it was just electronic noise as a result of the camera automatically cranking up its ""ISO"" in low light. Lots of point-and-shoot cameras do that, but this one's noise level at high ISO was horrible-looking.Yes, of course you can use NoiseNinja or PhotoShop to improve the grainy appearance, and you can use flash indoors. If you are comfortable with noise-processing software--or like the way flash portraits look--you'll probably enjoy this camera for its size and convenience. However, I returned it for a refund after a weekend of shooting."
1,LCD cracks easily!,"I had my camera for 3 months and took very good care of it, however, when I took it out to take pictures, the LCD screen had cracked for no reason. This problem occurs VERY often! DO NOT BUY"
1,Warning - LCD is fragile and not covered under warranty,"Please buy a different camera. I have owned 5 different pocket digital cameras. Under normal wear and tear, the Cannon SD400's LCD screen broke where other cameras I've owned have not. I just purchased the Nikon S7c with a bigger screen that is so well protected that I can hit it with no adverse affect. If you do buy the SD400, set aside the $150 you'll likely need to replace the LCD."
1,"Soft Focus, Disappointing Results","As a digital photography enthusiast and a fan of Canon cameras, I had high hopes for the SD-400, hoping it might be a smaller and lighter weight replacement for my Canon S-50, one of three Canons I own. What I discovered was that the SD-400 (that I ordered from Amazon) is incapable of capturing sharply focused photo. Every photo -- wide angles from distance, medium-range, head and shoulders, close-up, macro -- everything was every-so-slightly out of focus. It's best described as soft focus. Out of fairness to Canon, perhaps it could be chalked up to a bad lens on this particular camera, which I returned. But the picture quality was also consistently washed-out and no where near accurate or realistic."
2,The LCD screen is very delicate,"I was over all very please with this product. The images, the camera size, the battery life etc.. were all satisfactory if not slightly above. I had the camera not more than 2 1/2 months before I had a problem. The camera was in a Lowpro rezo 10 camera case on my hip when the screen broke. It wasn't dropped and I didn't sit on it. My mistake was to sit too close to someone on a bus. I am told Canon classifies it as ""impact damage"" and will probably (I am in the midst of dealing with Canon customer service) do nothing for me. The camera still functions but most of the features are not accesable to me now. All I can say to date is what a waste!! I was a repeat customer (I owned a powershot 30) and quite satisfied up until now."
5,this camera is so much fun!,"i love this camera! i had so much fun using it on my recent vacation. i was pleased with the quality of the photos, i found it user friendly, the lcd screen isn't too small and the timer feature allows you to take several photos over the amount of time that you set. the audio could be better as well as the fact that the lcd screen became scratched easily even though it was very carefully handled. my friend has and older sony that has been much used and his lcd screen is perfect still. unfortunately my camera was stolen. i will be buying a replacement and will most likely buy the same model."
1,Waste of Money,"If your Canon works great, congratulations... but if a problem does pop up, they will leave you out in the cold. AND A PROBLEM WILL POP UP!!!!! Their customer service is absolutely hideous, appalling, and unbelieveable. They take no responsibility for failures of thier products.Mine has the infamous ""Memory Card Error"". Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Why would you want to take the gamble?Aside from researching the camera model you are interested in, please also research Canon Customer Service Reviews. I would steer clear of these guys.Please read for yourself and spend your money elsewhere: http://www.stevesforums.com/forums/view_topic.php?id=38477&forum;_id=15&page;=1There are SEVERAL attorneys working on organizing class actions lawsuits against Canon due to their infamous ""errors"" that they won't admit exist. If these class action lawsuits apply to you, I encourage you to join."
3,LAID BACK COUNTRY CROONIN',"Kathy Mattea enjoyed a successful run in the mid-eighties and early nineties as a country sweetheart, her down-home charm, boosted by her strong vocals, bringing her a string of top 10 country hits.TIME PASSES BY doesn't stray from her successful formula, offering a pleasant, ballad-heavy collection.My favorite tracks: the humorous WHOLE LOTTA HOLES and the whimsical tale of HARLEY and the sensitive ballads WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN, SUMMER OF MY DREAMS, I WEAR YOUR LOVE and A FEW GOOD THINGS REMAIN. Her version of the saccharine FROM A DISTANCE overshadows Bette Midler's syrupy rendition, but I just can't embrace the song itself.Mattea didn't cross over to the pop field like contemporaries Yearwood, Hill, etc., so falls short of superstar status. Nonetheless, her vocals are impressive and she's a cherished country treasure."
1,Huh????,"I can't hear a thing with this headset..I turned every thing up..the headset, the phone, I guess I'm deafer than I thought. If you have any hearing issues at all this is not the headset to get folks. It is a nice looking set and easy to use but ""what did you say?"" seemed about all I could say."
2,Not robust,"There may be better headsets to be found in the price range, and could be cost effective to pay up for a better model. It's a matter of time until this jack becomes intermittent and will have to be replaced. Output volume to the other party is lower than desired."
1,Worked for a week,It worked fine for a week then the microphone started breaking up and now it does not work at all.
2,"This Headset is comfortable and good sound quality, but the mike is a huge problem.","I have used this set for about three weeks and will be buying a new headset. Most of my phone conversations now have the person asking me to repeat what I said numerous times. I thought purchasing a more expensive headset would work out better than the previous ones I have owned, However I will go back to the under $10 sets, They all worked fine and lasted for about six months. Usually breaking by the headpeice. I would not recommend this headset to anyone who uses a phone a lot."
1,One word - LOUSY,"You would think that Panasonic Cordless phone and Panasonic Hands-Free Headset would work well together, being that they are sold by the same company. Well, that is clearly not the case. I bought this headset specifically for the reason that it is sold by Panasonic to work with their cordless phones. I've tried it a few times and each time I get the same response from the person I'm talking to. They say I sound too far away, that they can barely hear me. This product is clearly not worth it."
1,Weak microphone makes headset unusable,"I have tried using this headset with 2 different Panasonic cordless phones, one 900MHz and the other 5.8GHz. For both phones, on a variety of calls, the other party has trouble hearing me and says that I sound as if I am very far away. I had been using an old Uniden headset on the same phones and it worked fine, but then the plastic head-band broke and I bought the Panasonic TCA-98. What a waste of money."
2,Microphone gain too low,"I constantly get complaints that the person at the other end of the line can't hear me because the sound of my voice is so low. Otherwise, it is a great headset. Comfortable, good headphone, sunds clear and loud. Just the micraphone seems to have trouble. So I'm not using it."
4,Perfectly good headset,"I have not had any trouble at all with this headset. I like the in-line mute switch because my phone does not have a mute button.By the way, this is almost exactly the same headset as the Plantronics M175 -- but $5 cheaper. The difference is that the Panasonic does not have a microphone gain adjustment switch."
1,Review of Panasonic KX-TCA98 Headset,"This product was basically unusable to me... a complete waste of money! It fit my phone just fine, and I could hear the caller pretty well, but the caller could hardly hear me at all. I had the volume on my phone turned up full blast, and the volume on the headset turned up full blast, and I was basically shouting into the mouth piece that was as close to my mouth as possible. The person calling said that I sounded like I was shouting to him through a wind tunnel. I had to repeat myself several times before he understood me. I ended up immediately removing it from my phone just so I could finish the conversation.Shortly after the call was over, the headset went into my trash bin. NOT GOOD."
3,"The Prophet, for profit?",Cal Tjader; The Prophet is waaaay overpriced$$$ for the contents of this cd.It's only 31:30 in total length. The songs are marginal compared to much better albums of thisperiod; Amazonas & Last Bolero In Berkeley.Here's a hint: buy the Verve vinyl and transfer it to cdr.That's what I did and it sounds great saving over a hundred bucks.
2,If you like Strings & Choral Voices you'll like this!,"Being an avid Tjader fan I would warn others to beware of the added strings & choral voices, this LP gets 2 stars for the 2 excellent tracks that have no added strings etc. If you like strings then maybe this is your thing!"
3,Good things to come,"The P Kings first album is a rare and welcome fusion of pop/r&b/jazz. The production is clearly the weakest point of this debut, but cleverness and emotion still poke their heads through with seeming materful ease. Lyrically poignant, and musically fresh, it's a welcome addition to any pop music library. Although this is a promising debut, the second album (not currently available in the U.S.) clarifies the vision and proves that the Philosopher Kings are certainly not a fleeting talent."
4,"Where are you, Philosopher Kings?","I loved this CD when I bought it 4 years ago (and I love it still!), and I'm wondering, when are they gonna come out with something new? Come on guys!"
4,Delicate Sound,"Loved the jazzy sound from the first time. Works great as gentle background music. Those musicians from the jazz scene became what I think is yet one of the best Canadian group. Gerald Eaton's voice is no less than astonishing. The only negative point would be the lack of musical dynamism, though you can remedy this problem with their live performance, One Night Stand, one of the best live album I've heard."
3,These are your basic sweats,"What can I say, there are your basic sweat pants. If that is what you are looking for, this is it. I just wanted the basic ones with elastic waist and legs and with pockets. The material is a little thin, but if not abused they hold up well and are very comfortable."
4,Wish I Bought This Book Sooner,"As a new author (""The Petit Appetit Cookbook"") I was unaware how much I would have to do once the book was published. I wish I had the book before publication. The author does a good job of telling potential authors and publishers how much work will be needed after the book is written. The ideas are quick and to the point. However I would like more explanation as to how to do some of the tips such as ""Arrange Book Signings"". There's lots of advice for whom to invite and how to bring poeple to the event. But who should you speak with inially to set up the signing? How best do you offer your services? I understand the book is brief, but just a little bit more help in the execution of the idea would've been better."
5,More Helpful for Non-fiction,"This book caters more to non-fiction. I still found some great ideas to promote my novel,Heaven Scent, and I think it's a valuable book for anyone who is promoting/marketing a book."
5,TRACKS ARE...,1. White Star2. Stillness in the Storm3. Forbidden4. Magical Place5. If You Care about Me6. Hunted7. Return to Darkness8. Through the Lens of a Tear9. Endless Sadness10. White Sail (acoustic)
1,1st Poor Book of the Product Line,"Since Exalted was released, I have been a huge fan of the setting and system and hence, purchasing each supplement as it comes out. However, this is the one supplement that I wish that I hadn't wasted my money on.This book is nothing more than a breakdown of ship design and ship terminology. Save your money, this book is fairly worthless for a campaign."
5,beautiful!,"This is one of the best soundtracks I think I've ever heard. I had read the book and decided to watch the not-so-accurate movie The Scarlet Letter, and when I heard the music, the soundtrack definitely made second on the list of my favorites. I haven't bought the cd yet but am hoping to own it soon. The love theme is so passionate that it seems to enrich the audience's perception of Hester and Dimmesdale's romance. I could listen to this music forever; the only bad thing about it is that it has the repulsive word ""rape"" in one of the track titles. Other than that, though, I recommend this to any music lover."
4,Barry reworks his own King Kong themes to create an enjoyable soundtrack,The film was claptrap but the music is delicious. This is one of my favorite soundtracks and I don't mind at all the John Barry steals most of it from his own 1976 soundtrack for the remake of King Kong. It's fun to compare the two and find the themes and variations.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR $!,"Way too americanized! Did anyone notice those Nine inch nails, X-files, and Buffy posters that according to the book are hanging in Raye's room at the temple? Did you know that Serena shops at Gap and Old Navy? Or that according to this book Darien gives Serena a ticket to get on the cruse ship that Raye and Amy go on, instead of using her Luna Pen like in the Anime? How about that Darien wears Nautica cologne? These are just of the many stupid additions to the book. This book ( ) soooo bad! If you are a true SM fan,. don't waste your $ - buy the manga,watch the anime, they are a whole lot better!"
1,Aviod like the Plague.,"this sux. don't buy it. Sailor Moon is great, but this isn't Sailor Moon. If you want a good Sailor Moon book, check out the manga books. They're more money, but they're worth every penny."
2,What I thought of this book,"I felt that this book was pretty helpful. However, I didn'tlike Ms. Sentar putting in all that romantic stuff that didn't happenin the televised American version, and I'm pretty sure not the Japanese version either. I think this book was well-written and funny. I paticularly enjoyed the fights between Serena and Raye and I am looking forward to read more about them. I just hope in future books the romantic parts (not occuring in the series) are minimized."
5,Wow! This CD rocks!,"This CD rocks! All the songs are catchy, and I got the CD today and I already ave some favorites.That's What Girls Do- 8/10- Catchy, kinda cheesyOn The Floor- 7/10- Great party song. The rapp in the beginning is a little too much though.Skin Deep- 9.5/10- Pretty song, good meaningKids In AMerica- 6/20- Don't really care for it.It's Alright- 7/10- That's what it is.I'll Remember You- 3/10- Too Slow. Depressing in a way.Here I Am- 8/10- Catchy music, but kinda cheesyHot- 10/10- It's HOT! Great beat and cool chorusI Know What I Want- 8/10- The beginning's a little weird.What Are You Waiting For?- 11/10- My favorite. Pretty.No Secrets- 7/10- OKTHis CD is totally worth the money! I wish that Angel hadn't quit though. I would have difinallty bought their second album!"
1,Ew,I cant stand this group! They are whiney nasal toned girls that just make me wanna vomit on their faces!
1,ughhh,I'm sick and tired of these girl groups who have no talent at all. Now I have not listned to this CD(and I really don't want to). The major dissapointment about this CD is the remade the song Kids in America. I love the original version SO much better and No Secrets ruined it. I would rather listen to Play. This CD is pure garbage.
5,I like the song Kids in America!!,My favorite song from No Secrets is Kids in America. I first heard that song when my cat Flower died the week before I started my junior year in high school. It was one of the videos on Jimmy Neutron movie that my older sister got me when I was very upset about having a dead cat.
2,They Sound Very Young,"These girls sound very young so might appeal to the pre-teen market, but I don't think anyone over the age of 16 could ever take them seriously. They sing like 12-year-olds and their lyrics reflect that as well. They did a good job covering ""Kids in America"" and had one other good song. I did like ""That's What Girls Do."" 2 Songs doesn't make a whole album worth it though."
3,Another forgotten pop group...,"No Secrets was just another pop group that came along and disappered. Why? Their lead singer Angel Faith (now known as just Angel) left them to pursue a solo career. No Secrets sort of fell apart without the strong voice of Angel to guide their songs along.Angel was probably the best thing about No Secrets-if she wasn't a part of the group, I doubt they would have gotten this far. The other girls have high-pitched voice that sound a little nasal, that were okay for singing backup, but not okay for singing lead. Sorry, No Secrets, but without Angel, you just fall apart."
1,Save the world,"I thought Aaron Carter was enough. These girls sound like him and act like him, snotty and whiney. It's all about romance for seven year olds. They will be over soon."
2,Im being nice when I say 'decent'...,"A lot of people bought this album because they had sounded DECENT on the Aaron Carter CD so they figured No Secrets should have a tight CD. Uh, NO! A few songs are okay, but for the most part they're teh next girl-group to break up. Unfortunately, my little sisters are the next teenage idols, so they insist on buying every poor-sounding girl group known to man. Most songs are the same as every Britney song-""I'm my own woman, blah blah"" except they don't have sillicone...yet.I'm not saying they're not talented-they have okay voices-but they need to practice or something before they record a bunch of repetitive songs. It's No Secret that No Secrets need to shape up or quit before they embarass themselves."
5,no secrets is nothing like play,"no secrets is nothing like play,play has 4 grils no secrets has 5 no secretes has very cool sounds and play on their cd they toook song from story and movies like cenderalla and hopesly devode to u no secrets did not do that"
1,"BAd,BAD,BAD,BAd,o did i say this cd was bad","Okay enogh is enoughNo secrets are 16 and they are talking about kids in america, this says one thing, they are running out out of ideas for songs. PLAY is much more talented,at least they sound there age while this girls sound like they are younger then play. HAHAHAHA.I saw them in concert and i made a sign that said i hate no secrets and the people made me threw it away. I cant bleive they said they sound like play. poor play, what a bad comparission, did u notice that there songs did very bad and there album didnt do that hot either while Play's album was at least in the charts for a descent amount of time. i saw another year and there record labe well relaize what a mistake they made."
5,No Secrets is a REALLY great pop group!,"If you love catchy songs, like Why Not by Hilary Duff, you will absolutely love this album! Don't think it is for little kids, cause I'm 14 (almost 15) and I am always listening to this album! But I am really upset, cause Angel left the group and No Secrets broke up. The opther girls, other than Angel, do they have singing careers also? Or websites where I can find out?Please email me at:ivanbj@bellsouth.net"
4,Pretty good....,"This CD is pretty good for a teen pop album. I was pleasantly surprised! The best song here is ""Kids In America"". It is the kind of song that makes you wanna roll down the windows in your car on a sunny day and just drive for the fun of it! The other songs follow suit to this superior tune...and compliment it very well. I am looking forward to their next effort. I expect it to be a much more mature album....and if they continue to progress with each new record, they will have a long career ahead of them! Good luck to No Secrets!"
5,It RoCkS!!!!!,"i don't have this toy, but my friend does! I'm 11 and i have tons of polly pockets! I can't fit them all in my closet! Anyway, everytime I go to my Friend's house, I play with it. This is the best polly pocket yet!! It's a dance party club that folds up into a bus.Comes with alot of accesories and i recomend not to buy this for a little child.(small parts) I keep begging my mom for it. I sure hope I get it for Christmas!!!"
2,The tragic and HORRIFIC opposite!,"I got this ""Yoko ono Party and Protest"" playset for my sister for christmas, and ours would not only stay together, it was hard to take apart. The whole concept of this is way to PON DE REPLAY, but ours was durable, it could be because I got it in mexico. It might be made differently.The polly doll looks like she got bitten by a rabid circus raccoon with the Chenaynay makeover, or Yoko ono! Our playset was The Tragic and Horrific opposite."
4,these seem a little better than they are,"the little plastic wings that let these hang on your ears hurt your ears if you aren't wearing the headphones behind the neck. also, there is no padding on the head band part, and considering the weight of these things, it does put pressure on your skull after a while. i definitely like them better than regular headphones with the foam cover over a hard plastic part, but i probably would have been better off with the regular big ear-cup headphones, even if they do look a little overkill for working at my desk."
2,not comfortable and average sound,The plastic hooks that allow you to wear this behind the head are very annoying if you want to use these as regular headphones. They fit OVER the soft leatherette cushions of the earphones...which makes them uncomfortable to wear..I had to snip them off with sheers..They are a bit more comfortable now but still not a nice fit..Sound is not bad...not great...If you can get them for under $10...worth the money if you plan on cutting off an integral part of the unit..which will now allow one to wear them behind the head..
4,good for the price,"These are quite comfortable, great for planes and pc use, a definate good for the buck set of headphones, either way you choose to wear them."
3,Good book to take with you on your trip to Japan,"This book definitely came in handy when I went to Japan last April. I was fortunate to be able to stay with a Japanese family for a week, immersing myself in the culture. Fortunately, the person who invited me could speak a little English, and I've been friends with her for nearly 10 years. In that time period I picked up how the English phonetics of Japanese words should be pronounced. This book does not teach that, so even if you memorize the lessons in the book, you will probably sound like an American trying to speak Japanese. Otherwise, it's great for learning greetings and helping you amongst Japanese speaking friends!"
5,All American Hero,"A great read for adventure fans that can be taken at two levels.For the happy idiot, there's an All American Lad who, against all difficulties presented to him, doggedly continues to Save America.For the slightly more intellectual, there is the funniest spy romp in years - reminding one of Harrison Ford in a Holy Grail epic, except that, instead of the Nazi thugs being WW1 Germans, they are CIA agents.Extremely readable, but, for all the fun, there's a serious message running a few millimetres beneath the surface.Do your bit for America - read this book!"
1,NOT SATISFIED,The advertisement for this book was that it INCLUDED A DOG JOURNAL FOR YOUR OWN DOG AND A SET OF POST CARDS SOMETHING MY SELLER LEFT OFF AND IS UNWILLING TO RESOLVE
1,Am I missing something?,"It seems that all this offers over what's built in to the OS, is commenting of documents, password protection, and combining multiple documents into one PDF. That's not a lot of functionality for [item price]. You can't even create Acrobat forms or use it for preflighting print runs!"
4,What is a tao?,"What is a tao? After many years of treasuring this little edition and skimming it for reflections when life is overwhelming, I'm not sure I could explain ""tao"" or specific tenets. (That may come easier with ""Tao of Pooh"" or some heavier text) The book does help anyone who is grasping for some wisdom in coping with... anything. You don't have to be deep or an aspiring Buddhist to find a means of balancing perspective in a world that often looks lop-sided and ""unfair"". Even in those moments, there is more to be revealed. There is beauty."
2,Not true to size,Had to return this because it was way too small. Ordered similar item without the mock neck and it was true to size.
4,Skin tight,"This was purchased for a slim 11 year old in a size large and the fit is skin tight. If you like a different fit, choose another product."
1,Hum Bug,"I ordered 2 of these Under Armour Tees, I needed MENS Extra Large, Paragon sent me 2 YOUTH sizes in Medium. I called Paragon and they were sorry for the mix up and sent me a prepaid return Label. After they received my return they sent me another package with the same 2, Youth sizes in Medium. I again called Paragon And the bottom line was that they don't or never did have the size I needed. I was told they would send me a return label......I'M STILL WAITING. FOR A LABEL AND A REFUND. NEVER AGAIN."
2,I agree not useful for experienced admins,"I was hoping it would a nice indepth run down that was a bit more than the PDF's you can download for free. In some cases the PDF's were more helpful! It was missing out on a lot of info, concentrated more on the Server Admin utility and Workgroup util. If you are looking for a more indepth info (command line info, common file names locations), I'd look elsewhere. Sorry Apple!"
4,Very informative,"Buy this book if you work heavily with Mac and want to know more, or if you are just getting into the server world. Informative, but as the title says- mostly just essentials."
1,Creates a sand bag and backed up water from filter,"Product is the consistence of sand, thus making the product a sand bag in the fiter. Product caused the filter water to backup. Ended up toughing it away. Waste of $13.00."
5,Excellent tool at an outstanding price,"This was exactly what I needed for replacing the stock front sight on my AR. This little device is solidly made, and its four-prong side is what was needed to turn out the standard front sight on my S&W; AR. Replaced that unit with a meprolight tritium front sight, and this sight tool's five-prong side was needed for that job.All that is left now is for me to hit the range and adjust the elevation of the new sight, and this sight tool will be right there with me to do that.Seriously perfect for this job and I appreciate that a ton. If you need a sight tool, get this one."
4,Nice tool!,"This is a nice dual purpose tool. I have tested it and it does work. This only issue, is that it is a little thick in the wall area, and depending on the front sight, it is a tight fit. Other than that it works like a charm."
3,Too wide,This item was shipped promptly but it is a little too wide to fit my S&W M&P 15 front site. I think I can make it work by machining it down a bit.
2,It will not work without a file,It will not work without a file you will need to adjust this to get it to almost work I just bought another from the gun store
5,Gorgeous Bottle! Wonderful Fragrance!,"I didn't realize there was a difference between bottles of Lolita Lempicka Midnight and got this one almost by accident (it just happened to be the best online deal). I am so glad I got this because it is just beautiful. The bottle sits in a substantial looking metal ""casing"" and the flower has rhinestones on it. It looks very expensive and pretty. The fragrance is, like others have noted, stronger than the original Lolita Lempicka (which I also have). I like the stronger 'Midnight' version better because the other was a bit light for me. The licorice smell is stronger and so is the ""mossy"" smell that balances it. If you hate the smell of black licorice or a damp earthy forest I would not recommend this fragrance. However, I LOVE IT!"
1,incomplete book!,"This book arrived, and appears to be incomplete. It begins with excerpts from Cornhill Magazine, and begins with Chapter 34! At one point the narrative again skips from page 24 to page 130. If you are a Trollope fan, as I am, be careful what you purchase. Some books arrive legitimate editions but this book, while perhaps a reproduction of an original work, is only a piece of the work, and thus useless."
5,Just what I was looking for!,"I am incredibly happy with this product! I recently started giving my cat fluids every other day and she isn't the easiest to control so I was eager to get this product to make my life easier. The product came well within the time frame, in fact, I received the item the day I got the conformation that it was shipped from Amazon. The product was easy to put together and took no time at all. The adjustable height is perfect but the wheels seem a little screwy sometimes. Regardless, the product was just what I was looking for!"
5,Zoom!,"Love the book... hard to find it, so getting it on the internet has been my best option. The book arrived in excellent condition. Good price. Great book! Thank you!"
2,Not stable,This chair has a major flaw. When you step on the bottom canvas foot rest to sit down the whole chair collapses. This chair is high so most children or small adults wanting to sit have to be picked up and placed in the chair. Since I bought it for face-painting it is useless to me. Picking up all those kids is too much work. I went back to my wooden directors chair which is extremely sturdy but heavy to carry.
5,Use it all the time,Great quality and shape makes easy to hand wash. This is my favorite cup/mug now. I should order more.
5,3 1/2 year old loves cars,"He likes it just as much as the others. It's ""zooming"" arounds on the floor right now."
5,What A Combination,Miles sounds Incredible here.Gil Evans Orchestra is right on time thru this must have.The Music Between these two is timeless.Miles Davis Never had Limits with his Music.that's What Made Him Original&A Genius.
2,"0LD SCHOOL MUSIC, I USE TO LOVE.","THE CD, SOUND WAS OLD AND OUTDATED. REMASTER FROM THE TECHNICAL SIDE WOULD HELP GREATLY. THE BRIGHTEN WAS NOT THERE NOR THE COLOR TEXTURE WAS MISSING."
1,one bad book,"Only useful information in the book is when he tells you to buy ""The Expert at the Card Table.""This guy wrote this book as nothing more then a means to brag, and his stories aren't interesting enough to save the book."
1,Repellent,"You really have to wonder how a person like ""Dickie Richards"" could exist, or why, if he's fictional, anyone would think that a book by such a character would be funny.The title is a lie - the book doesn't teach you how to cheat, and the author repeatedly says he has no friends. I have no idea where they got the ""157 classic and crafty tricks"" line from.That Penn would put his name on this book is just more evidence that, as a thinker and a writer, he's a pretty good magician."
2,not worth buying,"this book is not worth buying at all. it seems that the author is cocky and stroking his own ego with some of his stories. the information in this book is not useful...it's about cheating people at poker...but it is really about his stupid stories filled with inapporopriate language. it also seems that this book could have been cut down in half if you take out all the stupid stories and repeating stories...I recommend ""Gambling Scams"" by Darwin Ortiz, much better and more useful."
2,Not a Penn & Teller book,"Unlike ""How to play in traffic"" or ""how to play with your food"" this book is neither funny nor a Penn & Teller book. It is what it claims to be on the cover, a book about cheating at cards. The book starts out with an introduction by Penn Jillette who basically apologizes for putting his name on this book.Penn tells how he owes the real author ( who's given the nom de plum Dickie Richard ) an enormous favor for helping Penn get started in his career. The terms of this favor repayment were that Penn put his name on this book so people buy. It worked at least once because I bought the book thinking it was something it is not.The BOOK IS ABOUT CHEATING AT CARDS. Not magic, not humor, not funny anecdotes or tricks ; cheating at cards. It is not written be Penn or Teller and has nothing to do with either of them."
2,Think before buying,"As a fan of Penn & Teller's other books, I was going to buy this, but in reading parts of it in a bookstore, I discovered that it's not the fun, clever, amusing book about tricks you could use to cheat at cards or even ways to have fun with your friends at a poker night.This book is a dark and seedy account about the life of a professional (and possibly fictional) poker cheater. There's nothing wrong with that, but it wasn't the book I thought it was going to be so I wanted to post a warning to make sure you knew what you were getting."
4,essential read for home group poker players,"The book is all of the above -- but I feel that it is an essential read for anyone hosting a home poker group. The host can't possibly know everyone who shows up every week and the number of available cheating techniques is so vast that simply ""cutting the cards"" to prevent cheating is nothing short of delusional. For that reason, I rate it highly and could care less if Dickie is fictional or not. The cheating techniques are real enough."
3,"Amusing, yet disturbing","The book was interesting, if not completely enjoyable to read. Dickie Richard is a sociopath, and there is no sign of redemption in these pages. His biggest regret is not cheating in a key game.There are several very amusing anecdotes, but these are sort of lost by the end in all the bravado. I guess it's just hard to like this book because you can't like the narrator."
1,Disturbing portrait of a sociopath,"Warning - if you like Penn & Teller, or poker, or both, and you think the cutesy title sounds like fun - do not pick up this book. It's a fictional(?) first person account of a sociopath.""Dickie"" cheats at poker, but many of his techniques aren't clever or interesting at all. Announce a bet of 500 but only splash the pot with 400? Swipe chips when making change with the pot? Grab someone's chips when they aren't looking? That isn't too much fun to read about.He's beyond a cheat, though - he's really a complete sociopath who sees other human beings as things to exploit. He suggests swiping a wallet, or the cash box, or kidnapping a pet so he can ""find"" it and build a relationship with a mark. Ugh. Repulsive.If it's fiction, I'd say Mr. Jillette should stick to magic. If it's non-fiction, I hope Dickie gets some help. He's as disturbed and dangerous as any terrorist, and no benefit comes of reading his twisted words."
1,Who is this book for?,"If you are a non-medical researcher, comparing Western and classical Chinese Urology, then this book is for you! If you are anyone else... I strongly advise you to spend your money elsewhere."
4,Impressive sound and better than those tinny portable speakers,"I haven't had an opportunity to travel with this yet-- I plan on taking it on vacation w/ me so my wife and I can listen to some cool tunes off my ipod while on vacation (on the beach, in the hotel room, etc). Its very portable, you can keep a fresh pair of batteries (2 AAA) in the case, and the sound is impressive. For the price go with one of these over those lousy portable speakers sold in your average best buy."
1,Misleading Product,"At first glance this seems a great product but you get what you pay for (or less in this case). There is NO noise cancelling evident at all with these compared to my normal passive Sony in ear buds. The like for like sound level is about half compared to the Sony for the same volume setting on CD player, despite the 'active' box and battery. Although the sound quality is acceptable they are worse at keeping noise down than a good fitting pair of passive ear buds. The buds are big and uncomfortable and unless you are huge, will not fit comfortably. I tried them in a car (passenger), on flights, local bus and generaly walking around and there was NO noise cancelling I could tell and no bass. Save for the Bose or Shure etc. These are useless."
1,Performance of Noise Cancelling Earbuds,These do not perform - a waste of money! Panasonic will not provide a refund after these are bought. The noise cancellation is negligble in actual use and the worst of all the several type of headphones that I have bought. I bought them and now use them only as standard earbuds with the inconvenience of the additional noiose cancelling electronics. Panasonic has produced and sold very good products - these earbuds are totally pathetic regarding noise cancellation.
1,Waste of Money,"As the other reviewers have noted: It offers very little noise cancellation, and it is all the worse because it won't fit properly in most ears. The ear buds are too large and are hard and uncomfortable. For me, they fall out of place almost immediately. Any noise-cancelling unit that uses ear buds will have to have an exceptional fit. Another thing about noise cancellation in general, and this includes high-end ones I've tried, is that they do a poor job of cancelling higher frequencies, such as paper shuffling and most of the human vocal range. I encourage you never to buy a noise cancellation product that you haven't tried for yourself in an environment with a full range of sound frequencies."
3,"Ahh, dirt shoveling","Don't expect too much else. Just a lot of shoveling and vauge unispired musings on a life wasted shoveling dirt, while shoveling dirt, dirt, dirt. Blah, blah, blah. The title was the most interesting part."
2,A mostly disposable remix album,"Originally released as Re-enter the Abyss, Empyre and Fall is only slightly more relevant than the latter-day remix album, Pop Up. Most of these mixes are only different from the original mixes in that they're slightly worse.The extended version of Into the Abyss and the instrumental version of Draconian Dream are the only significantly altered tracks on this disc. While I find the former to be only somewhat interesting, I really like the later. You'll hear jazzy piano flourishes not unlike Mike Garson has dropped on many a Bowie recording.In summary, I would recommend Empyre and Fall only for the Sex Gang Children fan who has to have it all."
5,the best polly pocket set ever made!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this hotel is awsome!!! it has a check-out place and a pull out cafe and a table and 2 chairs, a store,a bedroom with a pull out closet,a longe with a couch,tv, and a magazine rack. and alot more!!!!! my favorie part is the roller coster and the ferris wheel!!!!you turn the wheel and the ferris wheel picks up the cars and you keep on turning it and the cars go down the track it's really cool!!!"
5,AWESOME TOY FOR ANYONE!!,"Even though the manufactuor says Polly Pockets are for ages 3-7, I don't really think that is apropriate. 3 year olds could swallow the pieces or something, and who says you have to stop playing with them when you're seven? I am quite a bit older than seven, and I still play with them!! I have a whole collection, and this is one of my favorites!! There are four rooms in the hotel, plus the roller coaster!! For people who say this toy is not durable, I don't know what you're talking about!! My toy stays together perfectly, and the roller coaster always stays on the track. This toy isn't exactly educational, but who cares? Toys are supposed to be fun, not an excuse to force more work on a child. But I guess it teaches you about hotels and stuff....I also highly reccomend the other 3 playsets to go with this one. I personally think they become a bit boring without the other ones."
2,Could use improvement,"My 5 year old daughter wanted a Polly Pocket house for her birthday. This is the only one I found at the time that was close to a doll house. I am not really impressed with this toy. It is pretty small for all the accessories it comes with. There isn't hardly any room to actually play with the dolls in the house by the time you put in all the chairs,beds, etc. It is also a little pricey. I paid $40 and prob should sell for more like $20. As for the rollercoaster part my daughter doesn't even use it b/c she can't keep it together. It constantly falls apart. Hopefully they can come up with something a little roomier that will actually stay together while children are playing with it."
1,cheap,this so called hotel is c-h-e-a-pit doesn't have steps or an elevatorit's small an not fun.the shop onlyhas a few accsories.the rollercosteris noisy and short.it is a whole bunchof crappy stuff. polly get some real hairand better playsets.
4,Really does work. Does not fall apart.,"Whenever I see commercials on tv about these kinds of toys I usually get them to find out they are small, very likely to break, and many other ""wrong"" things! So when I once again tried this one, it really stayed together. (Unless you try to make it break) I really liked how it actually was easy to get the Polly on the seat, and how it stayed on the track and went fast. Hope this helped"
3,fun but not durable,My daughters 5 and 6 play with this toy all the time. It's fun but we have trouble getting the roller coaster to work and to stay on. some of the others pieces fall off too but they are easy to put back on. In all my girls enjoy it but not worth the money.
2,was excited about getting it..disappionted when i read it,since master of many treasures left me unsure of what had REALLY happened to the heroine i was hoping some of that would be reveiled. i agree with the others that the characters werent well developed (i really only read this book to see what happened to the egg.) i was happy when Ky-Lin was reintroduced cause it was a familiar character like summer and growch were. and cried at the very end because of what happened to the dog :( (im lame arent i) but anyways the book was okay enough just didnt like that she didnt have a direct link to the egg she just happened to be someone who was related to the person that bought it off an auction and was marveling at it.. i wanted someone more caring of the egg or more related to it..book really disappointed me...maybe there will be a next one with ky-lin and the twin hatchling hopefully
3,"More of the same, but a decent wrap-up","I began with ""Pigs Don't Fly"" and found it good, then ""Master of Many Treasures"" and found it great. I backtracked with ""The Unlikely Ones"" and found it somewhat different but also a good read. Unfortunately, ""Dragonne's Eg"" does not seem to achieve the level of the others. The personalities of Danny and the lawyer aren't well developed like the characters in the other books, and half the book was just getting the quest started. I think it was more than adequate in giving the finality of what happens to the 'Eg', but the reintroduction of Ky-lin was disappointing (he is starting to get on my nerves). But the stage is set for the next great book, and I am looking forward to it. Too bad the time of the novels is rapidly approaching the present..."
3,not too bad,few cons:- Not very good to move around as the base is very weak- Getting a weird noise that gets noisier with speed- Can not adjust the height
1,Too Noisy,"The only speed I can use it on and not drown out the television is on low. Makes a clicking sound even if not oscillating. When I contacted Soleusair, the only advice was make sure it was on level ground (which it was). Don't waste your money!"
4,Good Value for the money,The fan is better than I expected. Not very strong but I assume most of these tower type fans in market are not strong either. It does require some assembly (approximate time to assemble is 15 to 25 minutes). Over all the fan is nice looking and works perfect. For the price and with free shipping it a good value and I would recommend it.
1,Save your money!,"After 2 years of use it was time to replace my Bionaire fan, even though I still love the fan, ""cricket"" noise has got to go.So, I bought the Soleus Air ST-2010R Tower Fan after reading the reviews and it appeared to be even better than the Bionaire BT45RC-UC, which we currently have 4 of in our office. Wow - big mistake! There is no comparison - the Bionaire is a much better product - hence, you get what you pay for!I received the Soleus yesterday and have already packed it back up to return. I didn't have to wait 2 years for the ""cricket"" noise to appear, Jiminy came with the fan, along with a few other weird noises, too. Air flow is extremely poor when compared to the Bionaire. With the Soleus on high speed, I could barely feel the breeze 8 feet away. It didn't even move papers around on my desk unlike the Bionaire which I have to keep on low or medium to avoid paper blowouts.Having said this, I'm going to go order myself another Bionaire!"
4,Great fan but customer service non-responsive,"This is my second fan, so you know I like the product. However, my fan had two left side bases instead of right and left. I called the company and left two messages. No repsonse. I then sent an e mail. No response. Amazon did replace the entire unit at their cost, and sent a call tag to pick up the original fan. Soleus would get five stars aif they had any customer service. The fan is delightful and priced right."
2,This fan is loud and noisy,This fan is loud and noisy even on the lowest speed. The body of the fan sways/tremors when I turn it on oscillation mode. NOT a good product!!
3,"weak, but does the job","This thing blows... lightly. You'd be better off with an oscillating fan, especially if you don't like squeaking sounds. There's a bunch of fans in this, so multiply squeak factor times bunch of fans, and you get a bunch of squeaks. The buttons are dumb too."
2,Worst Quality CD in My Collection.,"The quality of this album in ghastly. With the good material, it should have been one of the first albums remastered. Most people think their version of Unchained Melody is the origional, bt it was a hit by Al Hibbler in the 50's. Another Hibbler song on this collection is 'He'. Bill Medley did some solo albums and the quality is much better than this."
5,Unchained Melody-Righeous Brothers-I love the songs and it was my husband's favorite song-Unchained Melody! I think of him and k,Unchained Melody by The Righteous Brothers-Just love their music and songs!! The Righteous Brothers were my husband's favorite group. The song-Unchained Melody - He loved that song so every time I listen to this cd -I will think of him!!! All the songs on the CD are just great!!!
3,Unchained !,"The first two tracks on the CD are the guts the rest is only packing or fill, Unchained Melody without doubt is the star performer. Hope you found this useful Brian."
3,"The ""stereo"" mixes","I agree with the other reviewers: the stereo mixes aren't the best. Usually I prefer stereo versions, but mono (if you can switch your amp to mono) sounds better, with more punch. ""You've Lost that Lovin' Feeling"" and ""Just Once in My Life"" sound like they were mastered from vinyl because of the surface noise during the quiet passages in the left track -audible on headphones. And I wish they had engineered out the bass pops when the Bros. sang words with ""P"" and ""T"": they obviously didn't use windscreens on the microphones. Just listen to ""White Cliffs of Dover"" when Hatfield sings ""..and Jimmy will go TO! sleep..."" The word ""TO"" pops out of the speakers like someone kicking the wall. Beautiful songs in need of a good remastering."
3,Great Music - somewhat poor quality audio,"Remastered in 1990, this isn't worth ($), but this is the price almost everywhere, even retail. It's too bad that this isn't better quality, perhaps the version of these songs are better in the Phil Spector box set, ""Back to Mono""."
3,"1960s men, folk music, love songs, rock",This is a typical Righteous Brothers album. Too much echo but greatmusic that reflects the times that they were recorded.
4,Used CD,I forgot I was buying this used however it came fast and had no scratches or anything on it. It was almost like new.
1,An expensive postcard,"Having met nearly all of the people involved in making this CD, I must say that it is extremely disappointing--they have more interesting stories posted for free on the net.Most of what is contained in this CD can be found in greater detail in product manuals--in other words, stale. Furthermore, there is information I would classify as misleading and even dangerous in some cases. This CD is an impressive example of how to use Shockwave Macromedia, but lacking in substanceThe products recently available from gue.com, such as ""Getting Clear on the Basics: The Fundamentals of Technical Diving"" actually cost less and are far more appropriate for those looking into technical diving."
3,House Blend 7,"This CD is pretty good. I like Venom's style, but he uses to many of the same songs on other cd's. It's like listening to the radio and all you hear for months is the same old songs over and over again. I look for more originality when I buy CD's, and this does not qualify. 3 Stars at the most..."
2,Zach Galligan and Corey Feldman team up again,"My #1 favorite movie of all time is ""Gremlins"", and was pretty anxious to see Zach Galligan reuniting with Corey Feldman. Unfortunately, the movie is not one of Galligan's better performances. He's made some good ones (""Waxwork"", ""Mortal Passions"", ""Rising Storm"", ""Psychic"", ""Cupid"", ""Surviving""). This was not bad, just was not very great. There are a few funny scenes, and I do reccomend this, just don't expect anything nearly as good as ""Gremlins""."
1,What the heck??,"This is pure crap! The two best, or what you would think would be the best, tracks on here: atb's You're Not Alone, and 4 Strings Take Me Away are hacked!!! Someone sped You're Not Alone up making Roberta's vocals nearly Chipmunk sounding!!! Horrible and the person who did this ought to be locked up never allowed to mix another song!! And where's the awesome vocals that makes Take Me Away one of the best vocal trance songs of all time?? Gone, stripped away leaving an instrumental!!! And as for the rest of the garbage on here, it's mostly all techno, awful sounding tracks. Who the heck picked these tracks as they are not trance (except for Tiest's 643). After two good mix cd's they lost my vote with this one."
2,What happened???,"It's called Trance Mix USA!! Not Dance Mix USA!! Not House Mix USA!! Trance Mix USA!! When I saw that Kay Cee was mixing this cd, I was won over easily. I would really hope that Kay Cee didn't choose the tracks on here. I could've sworn they were not his style. If you like trance don't let the title fool you. Avoid this cd like the plague!! The only good songs are 5,6,7,8,9 (atleast they're all in a row!)The best song though is 15: Taiko's Rappelkiste."
3,"Cool album, but Blank and Jones and ATB are better","This Album is descent. The songs are so-so and the past 2 albums are better. Buy this if you really like trance a lot. I recommend the Trance Fix series, Trance allstars series, Blank and Jones titles, some ATB(Trance Mix USA), Tranz World (Webster Hall) series. Buy this only if you want to keep the Trance Mix Usa Series Updated like I do. Like all albums, there are ups and downs."
2,NOT 'Santalum album' as specified!!,"The product that arrived is 100% pure 'Santalum spicatum' from Austalia.It is not the 'Santalum album' from India as identified under product description. It is nice, but not what was advertised!!"
2,Not What You Think of as Sandalwood,"It has similar qualities to Indian sandalwood, but not quite the same. I find the odor much less pleasant. Be sure you are ordering what you want!"
2,you get what you pay for...,This oil does not smell good...I wish i had spend the money on a smaller amount of higher quality sandalwood
2,Was Sent Wrong Product,"Product received was diluted with jojoba oil. Amazon told me to ""dispose of the jojoba infused oil as I see fit"" and refunded my account.I gave two stars for the love of sandalwood. I was very disappointed in the product overall and only moderately satisfied with my customer claim."
2,Not as described,"Not .santalum album from India; it is the other sandalwood from Australia, which is not the same. Try another store for honesty"
5,Great continuation.,"Joanna has now discovered what really happened to Laurie. But it's even more complicated then it seems. She is growing closer to Penn, but she doesn't even know if he's told her all her secrets. And one of the group, Casey, is blackmailing the others. Stephen, Laurie's killer, is about to snap. Joanna can only pray Casey isn't his next victim. There was a lot of suspense in this book, but it's probably been wrongly labeled as a horror story. It's more mystery/suspense."
5,A DELIGHT,"MY COPY HAS BEEN WORN TO BITS AND PIECES,ESPECIALLY THE FAVORITES. THE RUSSIAN VEGETABLE PIE,SPINACH CASSEROLE AS MANY OTHERS HAVE BEEN FAMILY DELIGHTS FOR OVER 25 YEARS."
2,Bland,"I hate to seem like a spoil sport but though the bread recipes in this book are good (I particularly like the scones and the challah) and every now and then I make a batch of the sharp vinagrette, most of the main dishes are just not worth the time preparation involved. Part of the problem is that the spicing is off. These foods are just too plain and bland. The Potato Peel Broth is as just bad as it sounds. And the commentary in this book is so poorly written that it sticks in my brain like a bad jingle from a commercial. ""Saladly crisp and gardenly various is the garden salad."" Come on!I've had this book for 10 years and am weirdly attached to it; if you want a plain solid meal that you spend all day cooking, this is it. The food here is ribsticking but time intensive. Me, I don't see pouring all this effort into what is basically mediocre food but sometimes these dishes are comforting to make for a dinner at home if you've got all day to cook."
4,Somewhat complicated but delicious!,"I have used this book so much that now it consists of a pile of loose pages! Some of the recipes can be rather time consuming, but short cuts can be taken and they still come out wonderful (use the ravioli filling to stuff ready made shells; use canned crushed tomatoes in the creamy tomato sauce instead of crushing your own). Many of these recipes have become staples in my kitchen."
4,"Great recipes, caution in buying used cookbooks........","Intriguing recipes with a variety of easy to obtain ingredients. Balanced, healthy eating of vegetables and grains that you can incorporate in your non-vegetarian diet, and reduce you meat protein intake. I will probably never order a ""good used"" cookbook again. This one arrived dirty with food smudges on the cover and a few of the pages. I was too busy to return it, cleaned it up and use it with caution around food preparation."
5,"If this is not in your kitchen, it should be.",Vegetarian Epicure has many delightful recipes and dishes that nourished our family for 30 years. This cookbook is a staple for us.
4,Very Good,This romance was actually romantic. I have read quite a few supposed romances and they are mostly just lust. This book took you through Gaelan and Siobhan's relationship properly. You didn't feel as though their love just came from sex. They actually shared their feelings and communicated very well. The only thing I didn't like about their relationship was that they were kissing within the first few pages of the book. Pretty annoying and not very believable. There is one moment in the book that is so heart wrenching that 2 years later I haven't forgotten it. Very powerful story.
5,A great romance and a few mysteries too.,"The hero and heroine have their problems and their secrets, but the telling of their story will keep you up late at night."
4,Have not seen it yet,"LEGO's description has it 11 inches (30 cm)tall - not near 2 feet. It seems to come with directions for 4 robots and ""inspirations"" for 13. Lots of the parts seem very reusable."
2,Interesting perspective but too many errors,"Presents an interesting look at the conservative perspective on the environmental issues of today, but if you are looking for a book with accurate data that you can quote, this is not it. After finding an error right away on page 2, I found it hard to know what was fact and what was not. It does not present the sources of the numbers it quotes, so you can't judge if the information is any more valid than the studies it criticizes. There are better books out there presenting the conservative viewpoint on environmental issues. Does have an interesting section on natural radiation sources though."
1,"no science in the book, propaganda of large corporations","This books has no science behind it and is basically a screed against environmental action of any sort.I would reccommend as a great book The Future of Life by Dr. Edward O. Wilson, the Pellegrino University Research Professor at Harvard University, who has been recognized by many as an authority on the Environment, and has put together an excellent, very readable book, without hype, but clear lucid Science, thoughtfully presented."
1,An impossible task,"The review of this book states that the authors claim that ""nuclear power is a safe and cheap source of energy; that acid rain is a vastly exaggerated problem; that chemical pesticides are not as dangerous as they have been made out to be; and that worry over the ozone hole is just an environmental scare tactic"". To even attempt to claim these assertions as fact in a book of 206 pages (that don't source refernces for information!) is completely rediculous."
4,A pretty good start,This book is a good starting point for those who want to research environmental issues and not get distracted by the hype. It provides many resources and provides good leads. It is also an easy read for those who don't have a scientific back ground.
5,Great Illustrations for Bible Study,These illustrations are great for my church's Bible Study on the book of Revelation. The electronic format makes it easy to project on a television or screen.
4,It was really good,I bought this iron sometime back. It is easy to press cotton clothes with various steam options. It works fine...
2,Cheap Iron - Performs like One,"I used this iron for a couple years. The retractable cord feature works sporadically - I usually end up feeding the cord in manually. The iron has never gotten very hot and it leaks a little bit. Last week, it completely died, so I'm in the market for a newer, better iron."
3,Not too hot,"I liked the retractable cord feature on this iron, which did work well. However, I found it didn't get quite as hot as I'd like it to, making it difficult for ironing fabric like Linens."
1,A Frustrating Experience,"Unfortunately, I had a worst experience on this internet purchase. Vendor was not even able to return the phone calls or the emials and the product was never shipped. Vendor only reacted when a negitive review was written and only then the money was refunded.I am still not sure what happened on this purchase and why the vendor was not able to ship the item.Anyhow, it is past and I am glad that it's over."
1,Bad Design - Don't Buy!,"The retractable cord reel is not working well and we have only been using it for one week. The plastic mechanism the cord reels into adds extra weight to the product and makes it awkward to use, and it also causes the iron to be imbalanced when upright such that it tips: I've had to catch it a few times from falling over. The cord hangs low and catches on the iron and the ironing board. The convenience of a retractable cord is NOT worth it. Also, the temperature dial is so close to your fingers you end up hitting it often, causing it to dial down in temperature. This is just a terrible, terrible design. DO NOT BUY THIS IRON."
1,Inexpensive product that breaks easily,"Maybe OK for very light use. I used it to clamp a tarp to a 1"" rectangular pop-up frame. Windless day, about 80 degrees F. First one broke after minutes; by the end of the weekend about half of them had snapped. The clip frame is breaking between the spring pivot and the gripping tip. Bad plastic? Seller would not believe they had broken; wanted me to ship the broken ones back. Gave up and bought metal ones from Harbor Freight."
2,Poor Clamps,I purchased these to hold plastic on a PVC pipe greenhouse. Three of the clamps have broken in only one week of use. The clamps are not under strain and the temperature has been between 45 to 70 degree F. These are very cheap clamps. I recommend saving your money and but some better ones.
1,Questionable material,"In the July/August issue, the 'Clean Nutrition Report' recommends two products and lo and behold, these two products are full size ads, inside covers for the magazine. I question this recommendation with these organizations placing ads. Who is supporting whom? I also disagree with its Career Guide on obtaining Personal Trainer education. None of these schools are accredited by National education agencies. They have big names but considered bogus education.Why wouldn't one go to a 'real' school and university and obtain valid credentials? I could sit at home and be fat and earn a degree from one of these schools . I question this magazine and its 'knowledge' base; and sure disagree with the promotion of ""No Hype! Only the Truth"" campaign of this magazine. And $53.00 for a subscription? Wow. Just not convinced of its material with ads that directly correlate to recommended products and listing schools that are not true university level schools."
2,Marginal,"This fitness magazine is marginal at best.There are some excellent contributions from Dave Draper, Frank Zane and Larry Scott. However, other contributors do not measure up to the two Mr.Olympias and Mr. America.Often, the articles have been poorly researched, poorly edited, sensationalized, and the quality of the actual writing is bad.Personally, I find the magazine to not be one of the better health/fitness magazines that I have come across. There are better offerings out there."
5,History told as it should be,The author does an excellent job of relating the history of the Revolution as the riveting and exciting story that it was. The backgrounds of the major personalities are detailed such that you understand their motivations and priorities. The events leading up to the war are explained by examining the political circumstances on both sides of the Atlantic. The war itself is chronicled in a way that makes you feel you're part of the action. I literally couldn't put the book down.
4,If you like detail...,"then this book is for you! I suppose for some folks it might get tedious, but I found the tidbits of information fascinating. As several other reviewers have said, the author brings life to the patriots that we perhaps only saw as characters in a history book. He doesn't just portray them for the reader to view, he brings the reader into their lives. I would recommend this book to more than just history aficionados; even if you don't consider yourself a ""history buff"", this book might make one out of you."
4,An In-Depth Study of the People Responsible For Our Freedom,"In Patriots, A.J. Langguth presents us with biographies of the people who were responsible for instigating America's war for independence. He does an incredibly thorough job of disseminating information that typically won't be found in the history books we read in school. I occasionally found myself confused between the two Adams (John and Samuel), but other than that, it was a thoroughly enjoyable and informative read."
3,How much is myth?,"This book has been very popular over the years, mainly I think because it retells a lot of ""feel good"" stories of selfless Patriots of the Revolutionary era. Not a lot of interpretation, and much of this is retelling of myths without really exploring the veracity of them. I'd recommend it for high school readers."
4,Good Book,"A little wordy, but great read on the men who founded this country. Would recommend to any history buff and Rev. War buff."
5,Great for those who forgot what they learned in school,"This book was definitely not boring! I read it in 3 days and couldn't put it down like a good novel but I was actually learning stuff I probably should have known already.Some reviews have complained about the book leaving out some of the important southern battles. In defense of this book, it has given me enough information and interest in this part of history that I plan on finding another source to fill in the gaps."
2,A Big Disappointment.,"Having just completed a college course covering American History up to the Civil War, I was excited about delving into this book. Reading it, however, soon became drudgery, as I waded through confusing sentence structure, grammatical inadequacies, and interrupted narratives. The editing of this book should have been much more accomplished.I give it two stars for the occasional tidbits of new information (like the first Purple Heart), but overall, I found the book tedious."
5,Thrilling,"This book is the definition of a page-turner. Langguth has described the most amazing time period of this country's history in dramatic detail, leaving the reader craving more information about the individuals involved. His attention to detail brings us through specific battles such as Bunker Hill to the drafting of the declaration of independence.Amazing work!"
4,Enjoyable reading.,"A good historical overview of the individuals involved in the struggle for freedom. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in American history. Maps and illustrations included are good, but more would be helpful."
4,This is what they should be teaching in class.,"This takes you enjoyably, step by step through the origins of our nation. From the reason why Britian started taxing to begin with, all the way through victory and reconcilliation. This book is easy to comprehend without being condesending, and is surprisingly humorous. Some names in the book are very familiar (Washington, Sam Adams, Hancock etc,) and some arent (Otis, Hutchinson, Lee) and he treats them all very fairly, giving each a distinct personality. I recommend this to anyone who is interested in ""getting back"" to history. This author concentrates on the story rather than innundating us with droll vernacular."
2,Bjork? Miss Li?,"For me, this album sounds like their influences come from Bjork and Miss Li. Although some of the songs are slightly different with beat and rhythm, I think I'd rather listen to Bjork's Vespertine. Bjork uses the same style and the same sound with chimes and drums on almost all of her albums. I strongly suggest to buy one of hers instead. Much more heart felt. Although I really wanted to like this album, I simply....can't."
5,Interesting...,"My friend introduced me to CocoRosie and I have been addicted. I'm pretty open to music and you'll need to be to get this sister duo. Their music is magical, spiritual and beautiful, although it is mostly about darker times in these ladies' lives. I can relate and there are almost hidden sayings of hope and inspiration throughout. If you want to try something different this is definitely different, I was pleasantly pleased. :)"
3,spooky but fun,The album is a good listen and the album is cohesive. Perhaps too cohesive as the album loses some impact if you listen to the songs out of order or in random play.
5,Different,"Cocorosie is different. It is this difference that makes this album great. If you like rock, pop or folk, then you should enjoy this ablum. If you're looking for variety, then this album will be a good addition to your collection."
1,Complete S***!...,"Most god awful piss poor excuse for music i have ever heard. Its complete s***! I feel like my pocket was picked. Heard a cocorosie song on the radio that was entertaining, somewhat musical and thought i'd give one of thier CD's a chance. Unlistenable rubbish. Would not subject anyone to this crapola...."
3,It pains me to write this,"Well, I certainly didn't dislike this album, but as someone who adored CocoRosie's first two efforts, I'm a little bit disappointed by The Adventures of Ghosthorse and Stillborn. This album has a much more cleaned up sound than anything I've previously heard from CocoRosie. I think that the production kind of sucks. I feel like whatever wonderful element that made La Maison de Mon Reve and Noah's Ark so endlessly enchanting to me is hardly even present here."
5,this is a magical (short review),"This does not fall short in any respects!Cocorosie's imagery is beautiful and frightening, like the hypnopompic state of not-quite-awake. Definitely have they not at all declined over albums. Ever strengthening their abilities in storytelling and musicianship, Cocorosie leads the listener inward to a tiny, new world of romance and creepies. The whole disc seems so natural and carefree, but at the same time every word and sound is so, so perfectly placed. It's real enjoyable."
4,"good compilation, not many rarities though","i love box sets, and was incredibly excited to receive this as a present, because i am a HUGE Silverchair fan. I was disappointed by the fact that this set does not include many rarities, although it does have an interactive disc, which is awesome to view. Also, there is one song on one of the discs called ""Undecided."" This song is NOT the same song on the Frogstomp album. ""Slab"" is an interesting 7+ minute mix by Nick Launay, it's basically a huge compilation of all of the songs on ""Freak Show."" The rarities in this set are not phenomenal, but the set is worth buying."
5,Great Collection of Singles,The box set is a collection of all the freakshow singles and it includes an Interview Disc. For any die-hard silverchair fans it is a great pick.
3,"Readable, but not a great translation","I bought this edition for a course because it was cheap. This is a good introduction to Freud's theory of dreams. Quite readable. My only problem was with the translation -- it's an early 20th century British translation and apparently some of the sex stuff was ""cleaned up"" by the translator, who didn't want to offend british sensibilities. I'd recommend another translation."
3,"Tom Sawyer, Avenger","Well, Tom Sawyer, Avenger isn't like The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. But I guess it wasn't supposed to be. Becky Thatcher definitely is highly opinionated. The scenes in the story where she is kidnapped are, well, vivid. She is very open about her ""bowel habits"". The ""N"" word is used throughout, but I guess it had to be used. In itself it is a very interesting story. Except there are mispelled words. Sometimes it is hard to understand with the mispelled words, you have to go back and reread it. But it isn't too bad. What Tom and Becky discover at the stantan home surprised me. I won't give it away. This is a good book, and I enjoyed it. I don't think it is for everyone. Maybe not grade school kids. Jr. High is fine. I give it three and a half stars, even though I can only give it three here."
1,Poorly Written,"While the plot was somewhat interesting, I found the author's grammatical mistakes to be distracting. For example, in at least one place, s/he uses the word ""are"" instead of ""our."" There are many other such errors, along with many incidences of poor usage. I was amazed to see so many five star reviews here...until I started to notice that most of them appear to be written by the same person. Hmmm, I wonder who that could be?My advice: stick with Mark Twain and avoid this one."
4,Perfectly good television,"Good acting, likeable characters. Interesting plot each episode. Didn't realize how much I liked this show until I watched the last episode and said to myself, ""This is it?!?!"""
5,Worth re watching.... a keeper,This is a smart funny show. I'm just going through for a third time now and thought I should offer a review. There were only two seasons but the makers were able to tie up the story arc in a proper conclusion.Time has proven this show to be one of the better ones made. Recommended.
4,Give it a chance,"At first, it started out slow. The quirky character; you had to understand how he got that way. I just saw the last couple of episodes, and it's much better. It's now on my Tivo's Season Pass."
5,Great show,I dont get caught up in many shows but this one was addicting. Really liked his character and his relaxed state of mind....we all need that ! :)
5,Life is Good,"I thought it would be hard to top season one of Life, but season two continues to entertain, and hold me in suspense."
5,Sad,This was one of the best shows I have ever watched. I hated that it got cancelled. Ths new show that Sarah is in is fair(Fairly Legal) - but the chemistry between them was outstanding.
3,What happened to the original music?,"I loved this show WHEN IT WAS ON TV (It was 5 star worthy). The DVDs (season 1 and 2) are a big disappointment with the awful replacement music. I didn't understand how much emotion was not only solicited by the great acting and writing but more so by the score. When I used to re-watch the TV versions (that I Tivo'd but lost when my tivo crashed!), I had an emotional response every time I watched it. When I watched the DVDs -- no such response. It was almost like I bought a Gucci bag only to take it home and find out it's a knock-off. I hope Damien Lewis comes back to TV!!"
3,Not so great,"After fully enjoying Season 1 of Life, I have been very disappointed with Season 2. They must have new writers for this season. Didn't start off anywhere near as captivating as Season 1 and as it went by it felt like they were just putting in all the factors from other shows they could in order to keep an audience. Even to changing lead female characters towards the end! If you loved the characters in Season 1, you can watch this one too, but you won't be as caught up in it or find yourself watching episode after episode because you just couldn't stop... at least I found one was enough and watched Season 2 much more slowly. I can see why it only made it through two seasons."
5,Life ..the best show on TV for the winter of 2009,This was the best show on tv last winter. I had season one and now I have season two. What a shame it was cancelled. I highly recommend the show to everyone.
5,How American TV has lost it's way,"First off I just want to express my gratitude to the writers of this show for having the imagination to write such fascinating material. Life is such a unique show and has that combination of humor and drama one rarely see's these days. Damien Lewis has always been one my favorite actors ever since Band of Brothers. Why did they cancel this show? Where have all the good shows gone these days? Reality shows this, reality shows that. Jersey Shore, The Khardasians(did I spell that correctly?, The X Factor, and pretty much anything on MTV or E. What an insult to the American viewer."
5,As good as it gets,"The second season gets down and dirty. Yet the Zen flows. If you are a fan, you are a fan."
5,The best bet you need this Life,"Life the second season comes with the same quirkiness,but with an effective mystery and while you may think ""It is the same police drama as the others"" The answer is a big NO!! Damian Lewis,Sarah Shahi and the rest of the cast elevates the drama many times. If you already know that it was canceled you may think they did not answer the main plot trust me they did efficiently. So sorry Simon Baker you may play a broken hero but Mr. Damian Lewis beats you with a bang."
5,Fun and Entertaing Series,I loved the characters and the show kept me entertained episode after episode. just wished it wasn't cancelled so quickly.
5,Sorry I missed it on TV,This was a two season TV Show I missed. I believe it was on oppositeNCIS? It was a great show & the ending episode was done correctly. Ithad a satisfying ending!!!
3,Skillful interpretations and a ton of talent,"Between The Bridges is a colorful musical collage from a wide spectrum of popular influences. The most obvious genre is the British Invasion Beatles Clones (particularly the Hollies and the Zombies). `Don't You Believe A Word' and `Waiting For The Slow Songs' are charming Mersey Beat songs. The roaring bass line on `All By Ourselves' owes a lot to Big Star. `Take Good Care Of The Poor Boy' does a delightful job with its high-pitched Nazz (Todd Rundgren) vocal harmonies. Sloan even adds a graceful touch of country (A Long Time Coming) similar to the Jayhawks. I'm not certain who took humor out of pop music, but Sloan made a prudent choice to put it back - see `Losing California.' Each song is a stellar AM radio hit. Skillful interpretations by a band with a ton of talent. I'm very interested in seeing what road Sloan takes next."
3,There is a freshness that is... well... uhm... refreshing,"This Canadian band comes from that white hot music scene... Halifax, Nova Scotia. Combining the straight forward sense of the best of late 70's pop rock with 90's production values, Sloan are retro in a good way. These are basic guitar rock songs that don't go over the top into heavy metal, nor do they slip into the maudlin sameness of top 40 rock. There is a freshness that is... well... uhm... refreshing. Already big in Canada, Sloan hopes to break through into the U.S. market. I don't know if ""Between the Bridges"" will make that happen, but I like it."
5,What we should be hearing on the radio in the US!,Great CD. I love the keyboards throughout. One of those CD's I can listen to over and over and always hear something new!
2,ugh,"sloan have long been one of my favourite bands. in fact, as i've moved away from listening to ""rawk"" in favour of more electronic and hop hop over the past decade, i've still dug sloan. some how, they could always pull off the cheese with just enough enthusiasm, and just enough sarcasm. with this album, though, they've finally bought into their own press releases. man, this album stinks, that simple. too bad, cause back in the day, man, sloan could rock it out..."
5,Another Classic from Sloan,"Sloan delivers upon the promise shown in ""Navy Blues"" on their latest. Excellent hooks, great songwriting from the entire band, and an expanded sonic pallet make this Sloan's most satisfying release to date. Any fan of power pop should not pass this up."
4,Sloan does it again,"A definite buy despite the fact that I gave this CD four stars... it would have been a 5 star buy if it weren't for the fact that when I think of Sloan, I always think of ""Twice Removed"" which IMHO was their best album by far. After listening to this album a few dozen times I definitely hear the influences of 70s rock... at times it's reminicent of Meatloaf or BTO... then it kinda sounds like something Fleetwood Mac would do.The band is evolving into a great set of song writers - this effort is definitely more melodic and intelligently written than any past efforts. BUY THIS CD!"
5,Sloan is getting better!,"Well, here we are again. You have got to give a BIG thumbs up to a band who respects their fans enough to put out a new record every year! Sloan's Between the Bridges is by far one of their best! Smeared, the bands first full length, was promising.....Twice Removed was released and was incredible....then came One Chord and it was even better....then, the flawless Navy Blues which in my opinion is their best.....now, Between the Bridges. This record is one of the greatest steps forward for a band ever!Their songwriting craftsmanship is now growing into a mature, yet fun and witty existance! Long live SLOAN! I'm sure the songs will only go up from here making them the next Cheap Trick or Replacements!"
3,Not their best effort...,"Although one of the most underrated bands around, Sloan missed the mark on ""Between The Bridges"", which contains a few excellent tunes but mostly consists of mediocre material. ""Don't You Believe A Word"" is a great song, and ""Friendship"" and ""All By Ourselves"" are also worthy of mention. There's little else here of interest, however."
3,Peek a Boo,"Finding Sloan between their influences is a bit like playing ""Where's Waldo?"" In this CD you hear bits of the Beatles, of Badfinger, of scattered chapters in Alex Chilton's career, and of the Replacements. You hear seamless playing, tuneful harmonies, and -- rare in these days -- lyrics so clearly sung that you scarcely miss a lyric sheet with the CD. And yet at the end of this unquestionably pleasant 40 minutes or so of music, I'm left wondering where and what is Sloan as a band. The second half of the CD is better than the first. Sensory Deprivation and Losing California come closest to rocking in what is more than anything else a collection of radio-friendly pop songs. Nothing wrong with that -- as Paul McCartney has known ever since Silly Love Songs or longer. Best of the bunch are A Long Time Coming, Waiting for Slow Songs and Delivering Maybes. Still, I'd like to see Sloan try for more. A riddle to close -- what do Sloan and Dolly Parton have in common?"
4,Acceptable for a kid but you do get what you pay for,"I realize the item only costs $20. This is why I gave it 4 stars. If I had paid more the rating would be lower. The dolphin is very light and open on the back. The chain is cheap and the stone has very little color. I think the stone was the biggest disappointment because I planned to replace the chain. The dolphin itself has a cute shape. I wish I had seen a picture of the back before buying. I've decided to keep it mainly due to time constraints and I will put a new chain on it. However, I wouldn't order again. I would probably pay more and get a heavier, nicer necklace. But, at $20 my niece can consider it disposable."
4,Addictive Melodious Guitars,"I really enjoy listening to this entire album because it has fantastic guitar work. Every song is melodious and fairly mellow, but with a hint of a hard edge. If you're undecided about buying this album, I strongly suggest listening to the free clips that Amazon offers. They'll give you a good feel for whether you'll like this album, which is consistent throughout."
4,nice,"Dirty On Purpose are this cool band from Brooklyn. I saw the lead singer walking around my old neighborhood of Williamsburg. They came out with an EP a few years ago. It was promising. But now we have the full album. They are this New York rock band that is sometimes psychedelic and sometimes into shoegazer stuff. ""No Radio"" reminds me of Belle & Sebastian. ""Always Looking"" is one of the best songs here. Sometimes they get spaced out like Mogwai on a few songs. Dirty On Purpose are an original band, and this is their strongest record yet. I look forward to their live show."
3,sounds great but the off key vocals drag things down,There are several excellent tracks but even those have a problem with the vocals. Some pitch problems that will make you wince and the woman singer in particular seems to singing in a key higher than she should. It is a shame because musically this band is rather great.
5,A well acted Gothic Thriller,"I feel nostalgic about certain old movies. This, along with Daughter of the Mind starring Ray Milland, is one of my sentimental favorites.Carol Lynley is feminine and achingly fragile--Oliver Reed is chasing her down wth hillbilly lust, to no avail. There are real gothic touches here, and atmosphere. Baby boomers will probably love it. The atmosphere of the old house with the mill looks genuinely disturbing without being in the cheap ""slasher"" category. If you liked the Haunting of Hill House (the 1960's version) this movie might be for you!"
4,A great scary movie combo!,"A great horror combo. I have always loved the shuttered room, and it is a nice addition to my horror collection."
3,costly,I l love horror and would be glad to see these two again I dont understand what makes the studio think that they are worth this amount of money I just paid 20 dollars for macabre by willian castle because I have fond memories of it when I was a younger but today I viewed it and it is pretty boring I imagine it will be the same with this compilation Pls sell this at a reasonable price
3,Got it and love it,"The CD came to me in excellent condition. I purchased it for the song ""I Love Lake Tahoe"". The other 2 songs are in a different language that I can't understand, but the music is good. As far as the song about Tahoe, I think there should have been more lyrics throughout the length of the song but I plan to add some lyrics of my own, so it's all good!For anyone who grew up calling So. Lake Tahoe home... this CD is worth the buy and won't be set aside to collect dust for long."
2,Review,"This book was OK, but a lot of the recipes were for dishes I do not eat. I did not find it all that helpful. But, I'm pretty much a meat, potatoes & veggie person. I don't do fish & a lot of other dishes."
3,i'tz aright,"this cd iz alright I only like 1 track ""dreamin on Chrom"" cauze ne$$a has a firme voice I recomend this cd to all the peepz that like Knight Owl, LiL One or Brown Side."
5,"Functions well, inexpensive, good","I've had this headset almost 2 years and I really like it. I have never needed a volume adjustment or mute button, so I'm not missing that.For what this costs it is definitely worth it!"
4,"easy to store, economical, works fine","I guess these aren't space-age with all sorts of fancy features (mute, volume control, slicer, dicer, ice cream maker, etc), but they are foldable, which is great for storing them in the kitchen drawer, the headset is comfortable and you can hear with no problem, and the people on the other end have always been able to hear me with no problem. Considering the price of some of the other models, this one is a best buy, in my opinion."
5,Inexpensive and excellent headset,"I bought 2 of these for my Panasonic office phones and they work flawlessly. I'm very pleased with the sound quality, and in testing, they sound great on the other end of the call. Why pay more when these work well. Note: On a couple of our Panasonic 4-line phones (model KX-TS4100) they just emitted a buzzing sound but that was a problem with the phone, not the headset (need to get those repaired). Highly recommended for Panasonic phones. I haven't tried the headsets with a mobile phone so I can't comment here. These are recommended for many different office and home phones with a 2.5mm jack."
5,Excellent hands free product,I have a 1 month old daughter and i need both hands free to take care of her while on the phone. This handsfree head set has been a life saver.
2,unhappy,"Disappointed with these headphones! Over all sound quality is poor with continual high-pitched humming in the background, interrupted only by dialing; also very ""muffled"" as if under water or covered up. Headphones do not have a volume control, and volume remains too low even with phone volume at maximum.I chose to return these headphones for a refund."
3,Like it louder,I like the product but wish the volume was louder. The volume is adequate in a quiet enviroment.
2,NOT Comfortable,"The plastic over-the-head head-band of this headset provides the tension to keep it on, but unless perhaps you have a particularly small head, I would caution that the pressure against the head is rather uncomfortable. The earpiece is not so bad but the opposite ""gripping"" side, which is made of HARD grooved rubber, presses uncomfortably above the opposite ear. (Sound quality is adequate.)"
2,"Looks good, but dose not work good","Had another headset before but the headband broke. My fault as I am a bit tuff on things. I like the looks and fit, however every time I have used this headphone with my Panasonic phone ( I have 2 units and have tried both), people can't hear me very well and say I am breaking up, whereas I can hear them just fine Hope this helps."
2,Another dust collector,"I was so excited to be able to use a headset while working from home. No such luck...I received several complaints from callers on the other end that could not hear me. I tried every adjustment I could think of, including adjusting my phone and holding the mouthpiece directly on my mouth. Sadly, this one made it to my pile of unusable products shortly after receiving it."
4,Better than I thought it would be,"I was looking to replace an older style Panasonic headset that I have been buying and replacing as need since the 90's. I purchased that headset from a seller here on Amazon and received this headset instead. I was skeptical but once I used it, I was surprised and I am glad I got it. I really like it, more than I thought I would. I was used to my old style. But I like that you can adjust the mic anyway you want (close to your face, far from your face) as well as up and down and the basic option for left or right ear. I would recommend it to you if you were looking for a headset for your phone."
4,I like it!,"Seems to work well, haven't had to use it a lot yet, but as we get closer to the summer and our calls pick up I shall see how it holds up."
4,Panasonic KX-TCA86,This is a simple headset but good audio quality specially with Panasonic KX-TG6052B phone.reliable and good
4,Headset saves hands!!,"Very efficient & works well, fits nicely & frees the hands for other things. One gripe, seems that the headset speaker distorts slightly. Contacted seller & they invited me to send it back but told me they have no more in stock, so i decided to live with it. All in all good product, quick delivery & good customer response."
4,Panasonic Headset,"My wife loves this option. I would have rated 5 star, but it is not wireless. Sound and voice quality is very good."
2,They CANNOT hear you,Consistent complaint that they the caller can't hear me... I have used many headsets over the years and this is one of the worst.
2,not what I expected,Comfortable headset. Callers could not hear me. I've been through 3 different kinds of headsets with no luck. I wonder if it has to do with my new phone... so be prepared in case it is the product.
1,Double check your items.,"It was offered as an accessory to the Panasonic phone that I had purchased, but on receiving the items the phone and the headset were not compatible.So make sure you check clearly before you buy, just because it is offered as an accessory does not necessarily mean it is compatible."
1,"Can't use, can't review","Just received my orders - 1)Microsoft LifeChat LX-3000 Headset, and 2)Panasonic KX-TCA86 Comfort-fit headset with travel fold design. I am not alone in the house, and we have 2 computers - one upstairs, the other downstairs. I used the MS LifeChat w/o a problem because it has a USB connection. But the Panasonic KX-TCA86 I could not try because its 2.5mm connection is too small incompatible w/ the computers' or monitor's plug in connectors.However, the Panasonic has a more comfortable & lightweight fit than the MS LifeChat. I can leave it on my head much longer than the LifeChat."
5,Comfy & Quality,"What I thought was amazing about this headset was both the quality and how comfortable the headset felt for a relatively low price. If you're looking for a high tech/big money headset, this one might not be for you. But if you're working at home, this Panasonic headset is ideal."
5,Great seller!,Good price for product and more than reasonable shipping charges along with speedy shipment. My new puppy chewed my earphone cord and I just can't deal with talking on the phone without them.
4,This headset is great!,"I love this headset. I have small ears and can't use an in your ear type of device. This head set is perfect for travel. It folds up to fit in my purse or glove box. It also has great noise reduction, I can hear very well and people can hear me while I'm in an area with a lot of noise. I would buy these again!"
3,It's good for the price but...,"I like it cause it's hand free...But the sound quality is so so...sometimes sounds like people are mumbling...a bit of ""Whats that?...what did you say?""I still like it but wish the quality was better...maybe if you pay more you get more?"
3,Cord is way too short,"Product sounds good and pretty well made. The cord is too short for use on a desk phone, but would likely be good for use with a cell phone."
5,"Heck, they just work!",What else can you say about them? They have held up well against our Pacific Northwest winters. They work and that is what we needed. Putting them back into the case after they've been out for 6 months is not as bad as it may seem either.
2,Only lasted a year,"Ar first I really liked this cover as it fit my bike well. I ordered a second one when I bought a new bike from AMZN. It last about a year before it rotted and tore. For this price I think it should have lasted at least 2 years. I will not purchase another one, so if anyone has found a durable cover in this price range please let me know. Thanks."
2,wish I had listened to other reviews,"The basic gist of my experience is that I wish I had listened to other reviews highlighting that it only claims to be water RESISTANT, not waterPROOF. I keep my bike outside and wanted the protection from water that a tarp offers, but with the snug fit of this cover. It looks pretty, fit my bike well, but could barely be called water resistant.I'd say this cover is probably great if you plan on keeping your bike on a porch, or if you live in a very dry climate, but otherwise you may be better off just using a tarp."
2,too short & too thin,"Basically the cover is too short and does not cover the entire wheels of the bike properly. The material of the cover is also a lot thinner than I had imagined. It is almost paper thin and it feels very fragile and weak. I'm not sure how long can this material can withstand the outdoor weather of sun and rain exposure. I'd expected a higher quality product from Topeak, considering the amount paid for a mere sheet of fabric. And also, folding the cover in its bag is like mission impossible, so don't even bother trying."
4,little short for my trek fuel,was a little short for my bicycle but after a few times of using it I was able to get it to fit snug! awesome product.
2,Not for outdoors,"After one year outside, the cover is in tatters. Might be good for indoor use, but it can't handle the rain, wind and sun."
3,Disappointed,After using this cover just a few times it began to tear along a seam line. Wanted to use it to cover/protect bike while mounted in bed of pickup but even with multiple bungie cords it's so light the wind catches it and pulls it loose. Works great at the campground however.
4,Gets the job done,"We don't have bike storage yet and my last bike fell victim to the elements. This cover does a good job of covering the important elements of the bike. It's pretty easy to put on and take off, though it can get caught up on the pedals or rear derailleur. Material looks like it's thin and I was afraid it would rip, but seems to hold up quite well. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's a little difficult to roll the cover up and secure it in the pocket. I had to hold it between my legs to help compress it as I pulled the zipper. I still need to play with it so see if I can find an easier way of rolling it up. And yes, you will get dirty rolling it up. But it's better then a dirty or rusted bike."
1,"Lasted One Year, Then Disintegrated","Nice design in terms of the fit of the cover over the bicycle. However, the VERY light weight of this cover can make it a little challenging to use in anything over a light breeze. It really blows all over the place.Worse, this cover only lasted one year of everyday use (in Southern California, plenty of sun, little rain and no snow). The fabric has now reached a level of disintegration such that ordinary handling of the cover results in tearing. My cover is now a sieve.I expect significantly better longevity for the price we are asked to pay for this, particularly as we can purchase similar (if not more feature-filled) designs with much more durable fabric, for considerably less cash. I suppose for long-distance road bikers, the light weight would appeal, and this cover might be acceptable if used occasionally on road trips. But, this one is marketed for Mountain Bikes as well. ""The Sieve"" gets only one star from this rider..."
2,Wind blown,The bike cover seems fairly well made but will not stay on the bike if there is any wind. There is no way to fasten it down. It blows off the bike and was of no use. Is only good in a controlled environment with no wind. Was not suitable for my use.
2,Doesn't Fit,"After seeing a lot of complaints about the size, I still decided to try my luck with these. But I must say that the size is indeed problematic.I have a 2012 Specialized Sirrus hybrid in XL, which is more of a road bike, but I decided to get this mountain cover since from the specified measurements it seemed to be larger and fit my bike better. However, even the chain wouldn't be properly covered with this. It just wasn't large enough, and perhaps my bike being XL worsened the problem.It might still work for smaller bikes if you want to try your own luck though."
2,Rotted out in the sun after a year. Try the Avenir here for less $$,"I must say, like LUCYPYE that mine basically rotted out all its strength in the sun after a year. I try to duct tape around the rips and it tears again around the tape. I am replacing it with the blackAvenir Nylon Bicycle Cover (Mountain Bike)cover for only $21 + free Prime shipping. That one should have rotted out even worse in the sun because it's black, but mine is great after several years outside. I think the Mt. bike Avenir is more generous, because reviews said the road version was sized pretty small. Enjoy!"
2,"Expensive, Tight Fit","This isn't a terrible bike cover, but it is expensive and comes with several caveats. First, I have a 17.5"" MTB and it barely fits over it. The front portion only covers about 1/2 the front tire and it's the same with the rear tire. If you're hoping it will protect against anything other than dust, you're kidding yourself. Second, since it is such a tight fit, it takes too long to fit over your bike. It's like trying to fit 30"" jeans on a 36"" waist. Good luck with that. Finally, if you plan on putting any after market accessories on your bike, such as a fender, rack, or mirror--you can forget about this cover. It barely fits a bike without any accessories. It's worth about $12, costs $30, and doesn't cover well at all. I actually bought an inexpensive motorcycle cover to fit over my MTB with accessories. Half the price of this and double the coverage. See review here: http://www.amazon.com/Pilot-Automotive-CC-6323-Silver-Motorcycle/dp/B0031I209W/ref=cm_cr-mr-title"
4,Fit's,"Whats best of all, with a little mushing, it goes back in the bag, It suits it's purpose. I bought the 26 jeep classic, it fits it very nicely."
4,Cover is good but could be taller,I have a men's mountain bike and the cover doesn't go down as far as I would like it to. I'd rather have it hit the ground than leave my pedals exposed. It seems pretty sturdy though.
4,Great Cover - A Little Thin,We wanted to protect our brand new bike and so purchased these covers. They are well sculpted to fit the bike and it is nice not having to have a separate case to hold the cover. However the material is thin (which I am sure helps with making it compact when you zip it up) and I am concerned that it may tear under medium tension. Only time will tell...
2,Does not stay on bike in wind,"While this cover does fit well onto a full sized mountain or hybrid bike, even a light wind will blow the cover off the bike. The product really needs some kind of tie down or weight to keep in in place."
3,Topeak Bike Coves,It is a great bike cover. Easy to cover. Easy to store. Great color and material. Wish it was bigger.
3,Guess my tires were too big,This did not really cover my Trek. Apparently not big enough. Wouldn't recommend if you have large tires. Great material so nice for street bikes or smaller mountain bikes (youth?) Delivered on time
2,Worked great for 4 months,"I used this bike cover for a bike I store outdoors in the California sunshine. Did a nice job keeping it dry and relatively dust free. After 4 months though the fabric over the handlebars tore due to weakness in the sun bleached fabric. It eventually tore the length of the bike, rendering it mostly useless.Reccommedation: no good for prolonged outdoor storage."
4,"Introspection, retrospection and his musical heroes","Dominated by tasteful horn and string arrangements, this appealing album was Morrison's first great achievement of the 1990s. It has now been enhanced by the addition of a second version of the title track and So Quiet in Here. Van as Fan comes to the fore on the great 9 minute track In The Days Before Rock n Roll, an intelligent & absorbing reflection on his musical heroes.There is plenty of modal & tempo variation. The tuneful Real Real Gone is catchy & rhythmic, the tender gospel song See Me Through is a stirring highlight whilst the exuberant Youth Of a 1000 Summers, a serenade to the ""sweet bird of youth"" is another true gem.The music is accessible and melodious with definite pop appeal. Morrison pays tribute to his influences, many of which were Americansoul singers. Enlightenment is a soothing & introspective album where tasteful excursions into jazzy realms add a special touch."
5,"If you're Van Morrison, 1990 could just as well be 1970","Like his legendary UK counterpart Elton John, Van Morrison has sustained an extremely lengthy career during which he's made few, if any, bad songs. This release from 1990 is aptly titled, since some people consider Van Morrison's 80s work to be more spiritually depressed. His voice is as strong as it was in his ""Brown-Eyed Girl"" days, and his minimal use of modernized recording styles make this album sound like it could have been made at any time during his career. Perhaps the best track is the intensely melodic and hummable ""Start All Over Again"" which is also aptly titled since his spirit seems newly revitalized throughout this album."
5,CD by Van Morrison,"I ordered the Enlightenment CD by Van Morrison online thru Amazon. It arrived within 5 days. I was very impressed with the speed at which it arrived! The CD is excellent!! Would recommend this to all Morrison fans. This is an old CD so was also very surprised that Amazon had it in stock! T. Haralson (Scranton, ND)"
2,Definitely Not Van Morrison's Best,"I love Van Morrison, but this album wasn't very good, at least not compared with most of his other albums. If you're an absolute Van Fan (like me) who must have everything he has ever recorded, then fine. But if you are looking for his best stuff, go elsewhere. He easily has 7 or 8 albums that are better than this one."
5,why its so expensive ??,"i check the price here , its too expansive its crazy ,just one cd +100 dollar !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i bought all the collection cd's on ""nu-urban co uk"" it costed me 5 euros each (brand new)"
4,Acceptable for the price,"This product is okay with this price. I feel all right using it to watch movies on my laptop. But honestly, to get the good quality music, customers should look for more a expensive range of headphones."
1,not worth the price,The quality of these were about the same as the ones you can buy in the dollar store. I could have saved $6 and bought some there.
4,"sizing runs small, but cute","I ordered a medium for my mini schnauzer. The large would have been too long for him, but the medium ended up looking tight (comfortably so, just not loose). I was hoping for a more relaxed look, like the photo shows. My dog has a slim body shape and is lean. They are still really cute.Fabric quality isn't great and they are super thin so don't expect this to keep your pup warm. I have a different sweater for my dog to wear for pajamas to keep him warm at night when we are camping."
5,Love it!,"great for keeping pet warm, but sometimes my pet takes it off I think she gets hot.It is very cute and she look adorable!"
2,The size is true to size,"I read reviews, and bought one size bigger which was small, and it ended up being so big.Now I read the return policy from the seller, and it says I have to pay for my shipping both way to exchange the size, so now the cloth is to waste.My dog is 3 pounds maltipoo and she has very long legs and lean body like a poodle, and the clothes falls off her.I should have gotten x-small, I am sad that she cannot even wear the pajamas..."
4,Adorable and warm,I was skeptical about purchasing pj's for my little Chihuahua since I know he doesn't like things clinging to his legs. It turns out that he doesn't mind wearing these pj's at all and instantly warms up and wants to nap! I did have to roll up the sleeves a bit but over all I happy with this purchase. I will purchase another pair for my new baby Chi once she arrives.
1,Didn't fit,My dog is 18 inches from the base of his neck to his tail and there is no way that this thing could reach from his front legs to his back ones. I put it over his head and his feet couldn't even go in the holes. My dog is only 22 lbs. This was a waste of money.
4,Very Cute PJ's,"These are very cute PJ's, but they were a little to small for my baby boy. He's in between the sizes of xxtra small and xtra small, so it was a bad investment for me, but fit my girlfriend's baby perfectly."
3,"Charming, but where's the bio?","This is a very accurate version of the original but I couldn't find the promised biographical introduction anywhere in the text. It's a curious little book, with enough patriarchal oppression to drive any self-respecting feminist (or post-feminist, or post-colonialist) into a choking fit; but it is absolutely charming if you can lighten up about all that. Keep a good illustrated botanical guide next to you as you read."
2,This is NOT a Strife(uk-70's) album,"Just a warning to potential buyers - this is NOT the album by Strife called ""Rush"" which was released by Chrysalis in 1975/6. The chances of a this duplication of names of artists and title must be millions to one! Any chance of Chrysalis re-releasing the original album? That one is a 5 stars rating!"
2,"Great product, battery life clearly mis-represented by COWON","Love the product, but after it lasting <50% of advertised and stated battery life, I must say that I made a mistake. What good is this if you are in flight with a fully charged unit, and after 5.5 hours it goes dead. I called COWON about this, and they said it is probably a bad battery....however, the forums have battery life problems pasted all over the internet. Needless to say, it is clearly a ""non satistified"" first time/last time customer. It is going back to Amazon on Monday without hesitation."
2,Beware of DRM file formats,"After careful consideration of sites like Napster and other download music file ""To-Go"" types. The iAudioX5 will not be recognized or music files(DRM)will not play. Even when the firmware is upgraded to 2.11_b1. Also if you have Windows XP the drive has to be formatted in FAT32 and the max partition is 32G leaving a wasted partition that the iAudioX5 firmware will not use for file storage because it is designed for a single partition. So if you need to ""wipe"" the iAudioX5 drive Windows 98(SE)can do this upto 2T in FAT32 or a third party software on Windows XP OS (although it needs to port through USB2.0 as well). NTFS formatting will not work! as the firmware is written to look at FAT32 sectors. Other than that this unit has many features and functionality that surpasses any iPOD!"
4,"Lots of features,great sound.","Cool device does what I want it to do,but could have higher resolution on the screen.Great music player storage device,good battery life,4 years and still going."
3,Writing Historical Fiction,Writing Historical Fiction is a good book for those of us who are beginning to write historical fiction. It is an overview of the topics one needs to do the job correctly. It has given me insight on areas I need to address in the writing of a work involving history. I would recommend it to a beginner in the field.
4,"Short, to the point. Informative!","As an aspiring historical romance writer, I found this guide to be: short, sweet & to the point. It's short in comparison to other ""guides"" out there. The characterization and and Language & Dialogue chapters were particularly insightful."
4,Is Billy the most TALENTED person ever?,"Is he? Does he have an attractive face shape? I LIKE his face shape.is this song actually any good? Do I merely give him 4 stars because I feel sorry for him? NO Its because I like his face shape.Billy INTENDS to make a HUGE comeback sometime in the near future. I SIMPLY can't wait!.......for the VIDEO....Oh a few complaints though, the last time I saw him he'd cut his hair, I feel cheated! Never have we seen such a tragedy since the Zac Hanson incident of 2002 *shakes*... and he just looks SILLY on the front of this single, and he looks like a GIRL. Oh and the pose?Apart from that its wonderful.WONDERFUL!"
2,"Looks terrible, feels fragile.","First impression was terrible. It looks like its been tied behind a car and dragged for awile. I don't know if its the color but the entire thing looks like it should after I've owned it for several years. Second impression, after I opened it, wasn't great either. It feels extremely flimsy. That is my biggest problem with it, it doesnt feel like it can handle much stress. The box itself is study enough, its the hinge. I'm pretty sure it's going to break. Can't say when or how, but if the lid twist for any reason this thing is done for. The top compartment is cool and useful. I've only had it out three times now, (target shooting in the woods) and it has held up, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
4,"Create case, with few flaws!","Pros:-This case may seem small but can easily hold around 300 rounds of 12 gauge ammo. Great for transporting or storing ammo.-Secure clasp leaves the lid tight and secure.-The small compartment on the top lid offers great storage for small cleaning kits or tools.-Flat top allows for stacking.Cons:-Handle in picture does not match product received, but no big deal.-No pad lock option. This isn't a big deal, but if you want to keep your ammunition locked up, find a different ammo box.-Hinges are small and could possible break under heavy stress. However 4 hinges even out load.Other Thoughts: I wish there was a divider in the box, this would help with sorting ammunition.- 1 Star for different handle, and poor hinges."
1,Sure is Ugly!,Their small box is fine but this box is so ugly. It looks like somebody threw dirt in the plastic resin. I am not sure what they were going for a camo effect but whatever it did not work. It is has a little hinged compartment on top that is so small I could not visualize using it for anything. Really cuts down on the size of the box. Box hinges look flimsy. I usually like Plano products but this one is a rip off. Looks nothing like the photo. I have nothing good to say about this box. Worst thing I have ever bought on Amazon.
1,Heavy Duty Cowhide????,"They look nice enough but the leather straps are paper thin, resembling construction paper. The concho's looked like they were made from a beer can and although the bags were constructed a little better, the leather is stiff and brittle like cardboard. No way these bags would last more than a couple of months.Cost me about $25.00 in shipping both ways, but had to return this item immediately to try and salvage some of my money. Don't make the same mistake I did."
1,Not comprehensive enough for a graduate search,"For potential students involved in the search for graduate schools in the Humanities, this book does not offer valuable information. Once in the post-baccalaureate arena, information such as the names of top faculty, department specialties, and available teaching assistantships are necessary information. As well, this book lacks a specific breakdown of ALL programs, particularly those in English. Such a book needs to be published!"
4,Fantastic Designer Resource!,"As a jewelry designer, I found this book to be incredibly valuable. While the text is not particularly well written, the photography is outstanding. Great detail shots. Many of the pieces have pictures from the back as well as the front, which is very valuable if you are trying to determine how a piece was made. Signature marks are shown as well. It is a good chronological view of the history of jewelry using spectacular examples of work. I learned a great deal from this book and would recommend it to other designers. As a book for collectors, I thought the assessment information (good, better and best) was without meaningful context and also had no monetary reference. Designers - this is a 5 star book. Collectors - this is a 3 star book."
3,I want to tell you,"I bought this book based on the far superior Beatles Encyclopedia written by Bill Harry. This was a big disappointment. The book is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccurate information. For example, there are three differnt stories on how the Traveling Wilbury's were formed, depending on if one reads the Roy Orbison entry, the Tom Petty entry or the Traveling Wilbury entry. Unlike the Beatles Encyclopedia, there are no pictures, which would have greatly enhanced this book. I am giving it three stars as there was some new (to me anyway) information, but the editting and fact checking were very sloppy."
1,Really Poor Battery Life,"I love this light. It throws off mass quantities of lumens!! :) And the duration was great... It would throw off light for 2 hours or more.However, the battery has really poor charge/discharge cycle limits... After 6 months or so the battery life really degraded to the point that I can only get 20 minutes of light out of it. And in fairness to the manufacturer, they state in their literature that the battery is only good for 180 charge/discharge cycles. That's 6 months of commuting. PLUS... I can't figure out how to get a replacement battery. I've never seen a time when Planet Bike has had them in stock.So... if you want to use this thing for 6 months... great... that's a pricey way to go but each of us has our threshold of financial pain.... but if you want something that is going to last longer do not buy this product.I'd buy another one in a heartbeat if they get the battery charge/discharge cycle count issue fixed."
3,Great but...,"A great album with a great mix but what about the fault on the track Layla - I have now had 2 copies with the exact same fault - a form of digital distortion from around 1'14"" to 1'39"". This sounds like a manufacturing defect rather than damage to the disc - I can't see any damage. I saw another review here with someone having the exact same issue - again they had received two copies with the same fault. Since most people have given 5 stars I am assuming that there are good copies of this box set out there. How do I get one?"
1,LDAP and ADSI for C programmers only,"While I am sure that the book is excellent, it is for C programmers only. The code examples seem to be comprehensive, however, I was expecting them to be in Visual Basic. No where in any of the book description did it mention that this book required a knowledge of C. While it may be a great book, it is not what I can use. Sorry."
5,The power of the Magdalene.,"This title just seemed appropriate to me as I was reading this wonderful book. I received it last week through Amazon and I devoured it since then. I am still discovering wonderful things about this book and about Mary Magdalene. All I have to say is-WOW!! No wonder the early Church felt so threatened by her, by the power she wielded. And why wouldn't they-she was the one who truly understood, believed, and accepted Christ's word. Christ himself had seen this; which was why she received special teaching because her heart was more tuned to heaven than the so-called 12 disciples. She herself had disciples that she taught and instructed, AND she was the first to encounter the risen Savior. If I didn't know any better, I'd say that Mary Magdalene was the REAL rock on which Jesus built his church (or intended to)."
2,Disappointing,"I have a great respect for Mary Magdalene and have always been interested in her relationship with Jesus (even before the Davinci Code)but this book is basically pure fiction. I couldn't believe how silly I thought all this was. The author has made up so much about her...stories of her birth, etc. It seemed more like a Wiccan myth not a Gnostic one. I find it disappointing to create such a story and then call it Gnostic. The Gnostic teachings are so much more than what this author has created and to call it ""the"" Gnostic tradition of Mary Magdalene does an injustice to any serious study of her or the gnostic traditions. This isn't ""the"" Gnostic tradition, its the ""authors"" made up tradition. If you want serious information about Gnostics or Mary Magdalene this isn't the book you want. This is just another silly myth some writer made up. I returned my copy."
1,disappointed,"I was hoping for some factual text, something with research and references but this is the complete opposite. It's just page upon page of legends without any basis, supposed sayings from Mary with no reference for the reader to research further. In my opinion, it's nothing but very expensive firestarter material."
5,I loved this book!,"It was such an affirming read, my soul and mind both loved this book. I found it very accessible and readable, unlike many other spiritually-oriented books that are overly complex. In fact, I loved it so much that I read it a 2nd time right after the first reading! Part of this was because I would have wished to have read the glossary before I read the text, the former highly illuminating the latter. A wonderful, wonderful sharing which I highly, highly recommend."
4,Damage,"The total package was good,but the first track on disk 1 is damaged. The disk also has surface damage. I am lucky that it is only on the first track on the first disk.I am happy with the total package."
5,Outstanding collection,"Simply put, this is the finest collection of Hank Williams ""singles"" yet. The recordings are original, and so is the sound; although a fair amount of ""cleaning"" was done. This is a 3 CD set (along with a booklet) and also includes a few previously unreleased numbers that, up until 1990, were not known to exist. If I had to purchase just one Hank Williams collection that spanned his entire career, well, this one is it. A+"
4,Good movie,"It was a good movie for a Fast and Furious knock off. Some of the graphics look real, and others you can tell are animation. Kind of like when you played video games at a young age, and you can tell the cars aren't real, cause they have a strange color to them, but that was only at a couple parts. Also the Nissan rolled a few times, yet they where able to restore it, which is definately fake. I know its a movie, but doesn't come close to how real fast and furious looks. Also when he got pulled over by the police he just got his body slammed against the police car a few times, and let go without a fine or jail time for doing 160mph.I would've given this movie 5 stars if the cars looked more realistic. I mean they looked realistic till they crashed, then you could tell when they where about to crash that they where animated."
1,"Amazon, you should have a NO star rating","Production value - ZeroThis is a kid with a home camera smacking a girl around. Poor acting, no real action, waste of money.Recommended as a gift for someone you hate."
1,Who is this made for? - Shaquile O'Neil,"I am very disappointed with this head set. First of all, it does not fit securely on my ear and wouldn't fit on anyone's except Shaq's or perhaps an elephant;s. Thus the mic boom does not stay near your mouth, so the person you are trying to speak with cannot hear you. Also, the sound quality is not good, so you cannot hear the person on the other end of the conversation...what?...what?....what?...this head set is useless."
1,99 reasons why no one knows when Christ will return,Waiting on being able to adjust this purchase to a type face size that I can readEarlier complaint refers
2,unlistenable,"Now this is something I rarely write. Especially since I was quite a music snob back in the day. This CD was soooooooooooooooooo hyped and got incredibly good reviews...and it is unlistenable. Sorry, I do not know what to say. Uninspired and badly played. I guess there is something here I do not understand."
1,Computer-Generated Junk,"The problem with purely computer generated music such as this is a complete lack of soul. It is momentarily interesting, but soons cascades into a cold, sterile series disjoint sounds. Purely cerebral, no heart, rock and roll by HAL 9000. An awful direction, and I hope no one follows."
3,lots of photos; easy to read; good information for beginners,This book is short and simple - reads easilyphotos on every page to go with information; a good beginning book - if you plan on wanting to learn to ride - or even going to a stable to rent a horse for an hour or two for a trail ride this book gives basic valuable information
5,Happy storytelling time!,"I first played this game when I was in highschool - about seven or eight years ago -, and now I am in a graduate school, with my fellow students who study literature . We usually read, but also like to create our own stories; and once we decided to collaborate on a modern fairy-tale. Collaborative novel we've never written before. That's when I thought of this game. I bought it, and now we are playing this game together once a week, to record and later dictate the stories told. We are making a book out of it along with our individual novellas. Much fun! The only defect is that the card set and the case are all made of paper, so if you keep it in your bag everywhere you go like I do, it is likely to fall apart; which will hardly happen, I think."
4,Beggars Can't Be Choosers....,"For the most part, this is a great video, especially when you consider the lack of drum 'n bass videos out there. But the go cart scenes were pretty useless. I wish they would have spent more time in the studio with the metalheadz posse. the studio scenes are worth the price of the video. all in all, an enjoyable video for the hardcore drum 'n bass fan."
5,Great insight ~ Cleaned out my sytem -- more energy,Just wanted to say this book is well worth the time to read. It taught me to clean and care for the inside of my body the way I do for the outside. Most of what we eat is sludge! Dead Food! Putting the right amounts of the right foods into your body/system -- changes everything.
5,Have the first addition - very well used.,"This book is the most comprehensive yet easy to follow program on the subject of inner cleansing. I like that he's not preaching or self serving, but very clear and to the point about cleaning out the ""toxic sludge,"" that we all have, as result of eating bad food. And, it doesn't require any fancy or obscure potions or pills -- just good, wholesome foods like fresh fruit/vegetable juices. Its in this book that I learn about the healing power of fresh (raw) garlic and the importance of including it into your daily cleasing. A must have for all."
4,Get a Bell !!,"A nice anniversary set, but you definitely want a set with a bell! Either buy a set that comes with one, or buy one elsewhere, but trust me the satisfaction and excitement of ringing that stupid bell can't be beat, and just adds tremendously to the experience! Much, much more fun than just hitting a mat, and recreates the ""trading floor"" experience."
1,"Eh, what can I say...","I don't know what they mean by Swarovski Elements...they are little pink butterflies. They look like they could come from any gumball machine! The only reason I'm not returning them is they are for my 4 year old niece, and they will probably be lost or broken pretty quickly and it won't be a big deal at all! I was expecting something at least a tiny bit sparkly, but they are not one bit!"
4,very cute,I got these earing for my daughter who is 4. They are adorable. My only complaint is that in the picture they look more flashyk/sparkling then they actually are.
2,Too Small,"Well I bought these for my 4 yr old niece, but since it was too small did not gift it to her, the screws are too small n very easy to lose, the screw thread is also not well made. But overall they are cute."
3,Pretty in Pink,"These earrings are pretty little butterflies, with the operative word being little. They are allot smaller than I thought they would be. I gave them to my granddaughter as they were to small for me."
3,Not for everyone.,"My initial thoughts about this product were positive. Good looking material with decent tailoring and a nice feel to it. After trying them on, however, I realized I couldn't wear them; the sizes were correct but the crotch was cut up way too high and they were extremely uncomfortable. They are advertised as ""classic fit"" but I would call them more ""trim fit"" than ""classic fit""."
1,Too Small see below,Too small! same size as Dockers 44 inch..Will donate not worth returning! !!!!!!!!!!!!!\ Believe shoddy qulity contol and one may have been a return..don't knowDon
4,INTERESTING AND EDUCATIONAL,"This book was recommended to me by a friend passionately and professionally involved in opera. I am a beginner and feared the book would be over my head, not understandable. I was pleasantly surprised. Although the book is filled with details that only readers well-versed in opera would understand and/or appreciate, it did not cut me off, but rather educated me. So the book is both a biography and a source of information about opera in general. However, it is written in a style that removes it from feeling like a school textbook. That is a difficult task and the author does it well. He makes the book both informative and fun to read."
4,Rather too technical for the average reader,"This book is best at pointing out individual moments to listen to in Callas's recordings. It does give short shrift to her life, and so isn't for everyone. The ideal reader is one who already knows quite a bit about music and singing. It's also interesting for the author's views on individual recordings. His one glaring fault is that he gives more discussion to performances he himself attended rather than the recorded music the rest of us have access to."
2,It's not really a biography,"This book can hardly qualify as a biography. If you are looking to learn more about the life and person of Maria Callas, look elsewhere. If, however, you are interested in a chronology of her performances and recordings and some comments regarding the technical qualities of her singing you might want to include this book as a resource. It quotes extensively from contemporaneous reviews of Callas performances. Most valuable feature of the book probably is the chronology of performances and recordings at the back. It includes references to recordings that are available, film available, qualify of recordings and film, etc. If you are looking to fill out your collection of opera recordings and want to make sure you have an ample supply of Callas at her best, this is probably a good place to start."
1,"Disrespectful, factually incorrect, and strangely biased...","The one thing that Scott's biography of Callas has going for it is that he mostly sticks to Callas the artist, and avoids the gossip and speculation surrounding her personal life. However, what exists is a choppy, extremely opinionated, narrow minded repetition of all the same facts that are better found in other sources. He mentions that Callas ""mistakes artfullness for artistry"" about 100 times too. He basically feels that the deepening of her interpretation as her voice grew weaker was not real, and that her lyric and dramatic interpretation became more false as time went on. As the book plods on rehashing the same old information we have read over and over again elsewhere.I own almost all the Callas biographies that have appeared in English, and I hated this book so much that I pulled out the photo section in the center to keep the pictures, and sent the book to the recycling center the day after I had the misfortune to purchase it."
4,behind the scenes bobby m,"If you want a peek and a good look of the behind the scenes with Bob Marley and the Wailers, this is the CD to get. You get to hear Bobby M's commentary about a lot of issues, including his music, revolutionizing the world, and who he is as a person. The interviews just add to the sick music they play. ""Walk the Proud land"", ""You Cant Blame the Youth"", and ""Bend Down Low"" are just some examples. Get the CD right now if you already have a couple of their studio albums."
5,HOLY F**K YESSSS,"A friend dubbed this for me back in college and I played the cassette until it broke. I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS FOR 15 YEARS! In my opinion, this is the best Bob Marley, Reggae, and possibly recordingof all time...PERIOD."
3,great,The shipment arrived quickly and safe. It was also neatly packaged.The item did meet my expectations and the description were great.
3,The Little Princess,Review by L.R.R.R. - A charming classic. It's a book for all ages. The book teaches us an important lesson. You do not have to be the richest soul alive to be happy.
4,Good,"Everything was great, except it had a price tag on it that was really hard to take off with out damaging the cover."
4,Good morals but the author is a little repetitive,"As much as I liked this book and Burnett's others (Little Lord Fauntleroy and The Secret Garden), it's clear that Francis Hodgson Burnett picked a theme and stuck with it. I can imagine that these books were written for children as moral tales, and I think they serve their purpose well. All of the protagonists are well-behaved at the end of the story, and good things come to little children who control their emotions, are polite, and don't throw temper tantrums or complain. These are great books for children because of their morals, but I'd wait a month or two between reading one to go on to the next; otherwise, they might feel a little bit repetitive."
5,Touching,I've seen the movie many times in many different versions but it's oh so much more refreshing and alive when u read it yourself and imagine what takes place.
5,Kindle Editon,Ordered it for mother. She passed the class with A's using the book. Is up to date until they make a new one.
4,Enchanting,"Any young lady with an imagination of her own will find the story of Sara Crewe delightful and enchanting. The rags to riches plot may not be original in and of itself, but the way Sara transforms her dirty quarters into something beautiful, all within her mind, feels almost magical. Her sweet care for Becky despite her own grief and pain is also a picture of selflessness and courage. She refuses to let her sad circumstances steal the joy she has always found in small things, proving that she can be the same sweet girl she was when she had everything money could buy. It's her heart, not her possessions that make her a little princes. The happily ever after ending makes Sara's story feel even more like a fairy tale.To read more of my book reviews and recommendations, visit larsenreviews.org."
5,Every girl must read this,Best book I have read. This book is the best book I have ever read. It makes you feel like you were in the story.
4,A Little Princess,"This girl named Sara Crewe had a father that was going off to war. He left Sara at Miss Minchin's school for girls. Every one there treated her like a little princess. Sara had beautiful dresses, her own bedroom, and a maid that waits on her."
3,"and tomorrow, we'll be seeing a trusts and estates attorney","I wouldn't give this story to my kids without first drawing up a trust and showing them a copy to let them know their financial childhood and college education has been secured. Sara's dad is really bad with money and I don't know what a ""princess"" is supposed to be but this one sounds like a Filipino Maid in Hong Kong. Sucking it up is one thing but being sweet about it is for the birds. The Birds!"
4,Touching,"I thought A Little Princess was quite touching, the way Sara was very kind to everyone. It suprised me when she gave a beggar five hotbuns! A Little Princess was a quite enjoyable book. I think you'll like it."
5,This was just the PERFECT book!,"The story of Sara Crewe is a touching classic novel. Although she was mad, she kept it cool. She remembered the fact that she was, however, a ""little princess."" I recommend this book to everyone. If you have the time, READ IT!"
5,Amazing,Good book. Very interesting and captivating. Easy to get into an Easy to understand and easy to follow the story.
5,True fairy tale,Wonderful story from beginning to end.Makes you want to dream and believe in magic.Fairy tales do come true.
5,A Little Princess is a very well written book.,"When Sara Crewe's father dies and leaves her with no money Miss Minchin, the owner of the school,does not know what to do with her. Miss Minchin decides Sara is to live in the attic and run errands for the cook. Sara was once the richest girl in the school, but now she is basically a slave. Living in the cold, lonely attic Sara is stuck with barely any food and one dress that does not fit. Sara is so lonely she starts to make friends with a mouse living in the attic wall and the two girls that sneak up to her room. After many years of living in the attic Sara's life begins to change for the better. Her hope of someone moving in next door comes true and she makes friends with the man. Someone is even leaving things in her room like food, blankets, and a fire to warm up the room. Will things get better for Sara? I think the book was very well written. It was interesting and kept you wondering what would happen to Sara next."
5,"A delightful diplay of childhood optimism, encouraging!","One of the best books I have ever read; uplifting and full of magic, this book challenges you to be as much of a princess as little Sara Crewe."
4,Cute Story,I liked the story even though it's a kid story but it really shows u that sometimes u need to believe in ur dreams for the act of dreaming alone could be satisfying. I wish I had read it as a kid. True classic.
4,A Feel- Good Story,I really thought this was a great book. I enjoyed all things about the book. Some parts were confusing though. I think this is a good book for all ages.
2,"Oh, my, what a good person she is","She is so good that she is so very boring. If you want an old-fashioned novel, read Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm. Much better and more fun.In the second book of Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, The New Chronicles of Rebecca, there is a very sweet story about overcoming fear. It is about ""Elisha, otherwise Nimbi-Pamby"" and his trials with a cow. It shows how to tell a moral story using flawed characters, adults and children working together, and fun."
3,its okay,i remember i loved the movie when i was younger but i should had of sampled it first it is ok but it is more for a younger reader
5,A CHARMING LITTLE STORY. AN ALL-TIME GREAT.,"What little girl doesn't wish to become a princess? In this adorable story, Sara lives through a Cinderella-like existance. First loved, then despised and abused by her caretakers, and then,...I better now tell any more, but you should read it. It is a timeless classic.You will want to read it over and over again. It teaches the importance of treating all people kindly, and other virtues.--George Stancliffe"
5,Great Book with Valuable Lessons,"My son and daughter were both enchanted by this story as I read it to them a few weeks ago. We all fell in love with Sara and her very active imagination. She inspired us to do good, as she did.I thought it provided an excellent opportunity for us to discuss how important it is to treat others with respect, even when you think you will gain nothing from it. Sara seemed to be nothing more than a lowly pauper, but the man who chose to provide some beautiful things for the pauper next door was so immensely blessed by having done so. Conversely, Miss Minchin thought she could treat Sara in a humiliating demeaning fashion, but it ultimately brought her harm. Thus, there is value in being kind to everyone we meet. This point wasn't made in the story (I know that would turn some people off), I just thought it worth using the story to drive home the point.Anyway, it is worth reading for more reasons than just that it is a great story, but it definitely is that."
2,I did not receive the product pictured,"I received a different book than pictured. different publisher, different illustrator and an abridged version...very disapointing to receive something that is not exactly like what is pictured."
1,A Little Princess,"I was very disappointed as I thought it was the complete edition of The Little Princess. I am trying to return it, but have yet to hear from seller if that was possible. The book was in good condition. It just was not what I thought I was ordering, and the return is difficult to accomplish."
4,A little Princess,"Sara Crewe was just like a real princess... until her beloved father dies. Now she is poor and has to work for her living. But even then Sara does not give up, believes in the future and tells such amazing stories..."
5,Wonderful!,"I received ""A Little Princess"" when I was a kid, and didn't get into it right away. Then a few years later my uncle and his family gave me the Shirley Temple movie ""The Little Princess"". I'd watch it over and over and discovered I liked it, but then I thought the book wasn't as good as the movie. But then I did read the book and found that it IS good! Wonderful! A classic!"
5,One of my favorites,I have loved this book and story since I was a little girl. It emphasizes the power of staying true to your own ideals and principles regardless of what happens in life.
5,Great childhood classic,This was one of my favorites when I was a kid and I cherish it as an adult. A must have for little girls.
2,"Great story, bad book",We were buying this book for my adult daughter to keep on her bookshelf to treasure as this is one of her favorite stories. We wanted hard copy but couldn't find it. were upset to see it wasn't the type of paperback we expected. It appears more like a workbook and doesn't fit well on a shelf. The font size is too large.
5,This book always warms my heart.,I could read it again and again. One of the great classics. Sara Crewe will make you want to act like a princess.
5,A Little Princess Is One Of A kind!,"When I read this book, it made me think about things that I hadn't for a long time. It made me cry when poor little Sara thought she had lost her fahter in the war. I thought it was so cruel for Miss Minchin to make Sara work. But at the end it was tight because Sara had found her father. This is an emotional story for any young reader to read. It has all kinds of things for you to experience.That is why this story is one of a kind."
5,A Little Princess,"I'm not sure why I've always liked this book so much- usually I can't stand books like this. This is a sweet, sad, and happy tale. I know Sara is a very fake character, but what I like about it is that she and everyone else realizes that she's too good to be true. It would be different if the author didn't even realize that she made Sara unrealistic.I think it's unfair to categorize this book ages 5-7. I didn't appreciate this book until I was about 9 or 10. I know a 5 year old won't be as touched by this story as much as an older child would be. My favorite part of A Little Princess is when Sara is in the attic and just cries. It shows that even she is a little human. I highly recommend this book to all ages."
1,Hated it,"I hated this book, and it's a classic. Sue me.Now don't think it's because I'm too old and cynical. I read this book at the age of about nine, and I still hated it. Why? Because Sara Crewe is the Original Mary Sue. She was so sweet and speshul and wonderful and flawless that she made me gag. She never does anything wrong, anyone who doesn't like her is TEH EVOL!!!11!!, and everyone else thinks she's the best thing since silk stockings. Even at such a young age I was revolted by this one-dimensional character who was obviously being held up for our adulation. And I don't give a damn about it being an old novel. It still blows chunks."
5,A Little Princess is a royal book.,"A Little Princess is one of my favorite books that I have ever read. Sarah is a little girl whose father went off to war. With her mother living in heaven, Sarah has no choice but to go to a boarding school until her father comes back. I love her personality and always wanted to be like her. She's brave, kind, and never screams, but makes up wonderful stories and can always be there to help someone-including herself."
4,Really Good Mix!!!,I reccomend this cd to all roni size fans....this is a really good mix cd. The beats are so intense and alive you won't want to stop listening to it...
4,excelent debut,"great album... no as complete as her second one ""when the pawn"" but definitely brought my attention to her awesome singing... ""criminal"" and ""sleep to dream""my favorite songs.. and also the use of a mellotron keyboard stirs up memories of the 70's ... great artist overall..."
4,sultery and smooth,"This album is filled with Sade-esque vocals united with original lyrics and creative musical combinations creating a soulful and emotionaly charged sound. I would recommend this CD to anyone who experiences a stressful day, i.e. everyone."
5,YOUR LOVE IS JUST LIKE HONEY...THIS ALBUM IS A PLEASURE!,"I don't understand why in this days it's so hard to find new muzik that it's worth your ears, aghhhh!, but let's go back then to the basics, Miss Apple gave an impressive debut filled wtih sadness and depression, my type of album, along with Amos, Kilcher, and Merchant this ladies put the mood for the mid-90's, this album deserve the success it achieve, I don't know what's Apple been up to?, but please comeback...personal favorites are Shadowboxer, first listen of this great album, Criminal the pop crossover, but still great, Never Is A Promise makes me cry, this is the best, A First Taste, wow! makes me wanna dance?! do you believe that!, Slow Like Honey, surreal!, those r my picks, but this album is overall good fair worth your pennies, and all that things some people post and strut about, I just say, if you're sad and need some sad music to cry along, this is it, such a good painful album....way to go Fiona..."
3,Tori Amos for Under-10s,"Most of the songs on this record seem to resemble a combination of Tori Amos' Crucify and Caught A Lite Sneeze. Fiona's voice isn't as effortless or expressive or beautiful as Tori's, but then, she's only 18. Wait, that isn't an excuse; Jewel was 19 when Pieces of You came out...I digress. Anyway, if you are a Tori Amos fan (as I am), you will probably like Fiona Apple, but Tori still reigns over piano pop."
4,Love it love it love it...,"I absolutely love this cd album of Fiona's... Dark, emotional, moody songs conveyed through emotionally with clever lyrics... ""Slow Like Honey"" is definitely my favorite track... I still need to get ""When the Pawn"" which I like as well and I read she has an album pending, but the record execs in stuffy suits can't find a hit song - and may shelve it... Well I hope Fiona puts it out through an indie... It would serve them right... As if hit records means better music... So Fiona, stick to your guns and release your album as you like it..."
5,I'm Afraid That She Does Have That Something...,"From the moment I saw the cover of this album, I knew I would love it.I have lately been listening to a lot of music. Fiona Apple came up after I mentioned to somebody that I liked Amy Winehouse and Regina Spektor, and I got this recommendation.I looked her up on Wikipedia to do a little background, and what really sold me was the title of When the Pawn...Poetic, but not flowing. I had to download Tidal.Listening to 'Pale September' gave me a feeling... I continued to listen...Shadowboxer was the track that ultimately screamed 'I'm Fiona Apple! This is how I sing!""I didn't know that Fiona was only 18 when this was recorded, and I would've pegged her for at least 25.I don't think a single song is repetitive at all. Each song tells a different story."
5,Free Fiona Campaign,"Fiona Apple's new album ""Extraordinary Machine"" has been shelved by SONY because they say it doesn't have a single. Fionahaswings.com along with Yahoo! Group LOVE RIDDEN have come together to unite Fiona fans to help get her record released. If you are a fan of Fiona Apple or just a music fan who hates being told what you should listen to by corporate giants visit www.fionahaswings.com for information on helping the cause."
5,Great first CD,"I'm giving this CD 5 stars even though I don't think it's a masterpiece. (although it is pretty darn close.) On the strength of Shadowboxer, Sullen Girl, The Child Is Gone, Never Is A Promise, and to a slightly lesser degree, Sleep to Dream & Criminal, Fiona shows what a wonderful song writer she is. But maybe most of all, it's Fiona's beautiful voice that won me over. Good song writing plus beautiful voice adds up to one terrific CD."
3,"""I'll never glow - the way that you glow...""","Fiona Apple debut album Tidal is a great collection of poetry-driven lyrics and excellent song arrangments. Standout tracks include: Never is a Promise, Sullen Girl, Shadowboxer, Sleep to Dream, and Criminal. The rest of the tracks are too sleepy or strange for me. The song I can't get enough is Sullen Girl, Fiona was raped by a stranger when she only 12 and this song is about that horrible experience, ""But he washed me ashore and he took my pearl and left an empty shell of me and there's too much going on but it's calm under the waves in the blue of my oblivion."" Shadowboxer is the best song on the record, her voice is gorgeous and full on this haunting song, ""So I'll be sure to stay wary of you love, to save the pain of once my flame and tiwce my burn..."" She sure can write! also check-out her sophomore effort, When the Pawn..."
4,Full of haunting moments...,"Although When The Pawn... has since overshadowed this debut, Tidal is still a treasure. It's most striking moments are the spine-tingling ballads, the watery suicide of Sullen Girl, the lilting Pale September and, especially, Never Is A Promise on which Apple out-Tori's Ms Amos. Makes a great companion piece with When The Pawn... simple as the leap between albums is so tremendous."
5,"After 4 years, it's still my favorite CD","When I first bought this CD 4 years ago, I had no idea how much I would play it. In fact, Tidal is the only album I have been able to play time and time again without ever growing tired of it. At first I only listened to a few of the tracks, but Fiona's deep voice pulled me in, and the album grew on me as I listened more closely to her lyrics. Tidal should not be judged solely on the radio hit ""Criminal,"" there is so much more to it than that. For instance, the slow, dream-like ""Pale September"" certainly didn't capture my attention the first time I heard it, but now it's one of my favorite tracks. Tidal is an incredible album through and through, you just have to become familiar with it to appreciate it fully. If you aren't impressed the first time you listen, give it a few more chances. 4 years later, it's still in my CD player non-stop!"
4,ANOTHER CHILD PRODIGY ALBUM- NO NOT BRANDY,"this album is a must to hear. i went through the whole album and thought that this is a really talented lady. she gives diffrent harmonies, diffrent vocals and diffrent moods not like any other. i can't wait for the next one. FORGET- that you may disagree with her views and remember that she is VERY talented."
